https://openalex.org/W2020968632,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its two endothelial cell-specific receptor tyrosine kinases, Flk-1/KDR and Flt-1, play a key role in physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Hypoxia has been shown to be a major mechanism for up-regulation of VEGF and its receptors in vivo. When we exposed human umbilical vein endothelial cells to hypoxic conditions in vitro, we observed increased levels of Flt-1expression. In contrast, Flk-1/KDR mRNA levels were unchanged or slightly repressed. These findings suggest a differential transcriptional regulation of the two receptors by hypoxia. To identify regulatory elements involved in the hypoxic response, promoter regions of the mouse Flt-1 and Flk-1/KDR genes were isolated and tested in conjunction with luciferase reporter gene. In transient transfection assays, hypoxia led to strong transcriptional activation of the Flt-1 promoter, whereasFlk-1/KDR transcription was essentially unchanged. Promoter deletion analysis demonstrated a 430-bp region of the Flt-1promoter to be required for transcriptional activation in response to hypoxia. This region includes a heptamer sequence matching the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF) consensus binding site previously found in other hypoxia-inducible genes such as the VEGFgene and erythropoietin gene. We further narrowed down the element mediating the hypoxia response to a 40-base pair sequence including the putative HIF binding site. We show that this element acts like an enhancer, since it activated transcription irrespective of its location or orientation in the construct. Furthermore, mutations within the putative HIF consensus binding site lead to impaired transcriptional activation by hypoxia. These findings indicate that, unlike the KDR/Flk-1 gene, the Flt-1 receptor gene is directly up-regulated by hypoxia via a hypoxia-inducible enhancer element located at positions −976 to −937 of theFlt-1 promoter.

The growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) is essential for embryonic development and other physiologic processes such as bone remodeling, wound healing, and ovarian cycle (1Folkman J. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1987; 235: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (4046) Google Scholar, 2Folkman J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1987; 82: 4-6Crossref Scopus (4409) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis is also a critical component of tumors, inflammatory arthritis, intraocular neovascular syndromes, and other disorders (3Folkman J. Hanahan D. Princess Takamatsu Symp. 1991; 22: 339-347PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kim K.J. Li B. Winer J. Armanini M. Gillett N. Phillips H.S. Ferrara N. Nature. 1993; 362: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). The search for potential regulators of angiogenesis led to a number of candidates (aFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor-α, transforming growth factor-β, etc.) (5Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among those, VEGF 1The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor-1; EPO, erythropoietin; HUVE, human umbilical vein endothelial; kb, kilobase pair; bp, base pair; EGM, endothelial growth medium; EGF, epidermal growth factor; RLU, relative light units; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; HIE, hypoxia inducible element. and its two receptors, Flt-1 and Flk-1/KDR have been shown to be crucially involved in physiological and pathological regulation of blood vessel growth (6Ferrara N. Davis-Smtyh T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that oxygen tension plays a major role in the regulation of VEGF gene expression (7Minchenko A. Bauer T. Salceda S. Caro J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 374-379PubMed Google Scholar, 8Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4163) Google Scholar, 9Shima D.T. Adamis A.P. Ferrara N. Yeo K.T. Yeo T.K. Allende R. Folkman J. D'Amore P.A. Mol. Med. 1995; 1: 182-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF mRNA expression is rapidly and reversibly induced by exposure to low oxygen conditions in a variety of normal and transformed cells. A 47-bp regulatory element located about 1 kb upstream to the VEGF transcription initiation site was found to be involved in the activation of VEGF transcription in hypoxic cells. This element includes a binding site for the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) (10Jiang B.-H. Rue E. Wang G.L. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17771-17778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). When reporter constructs containing the VEGF sequences that mediate hypoxia inducibility were co-transfected with expression vectors encoding HIF-1 subunits, reporter gene transcription was much greater than that observed in cells transfected with the reporter alone, both in hypoxic and normoxic conditions (11Forsythe J.A.

HIF-1 has been shown to be involved also in the regulation of the human and mouse erythropoietin (EPO) genes (12Madan A. Curtin P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3928-3932Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Semenza G.L. Nejfelt M. Chi S.M. Antonarakis S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5680-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) as well as other hypoxia inducible genes such as the glycolytic enzymes (14Firth J.D. Ebert B.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6496-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 15Semenza G.L. Roth P.H. Fang H.-M. Wang G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23757-23763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hypoxia has been proposed to play an important role also in the regulation of VEGF receptor gene expression. Exposure of rats to acute or chronic hypoxia led to pronounced up-regulation of bothFlt-1 and Flk-1/KDR genes in the lung vasculature (16Tuder R.M. Flook B.E. Voelkel N.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1798-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Also, Flk-1/KDR and Flt-1 mRNAs were substantially up-regulated throughout the heart following myocardial infarction in the rat (17Li J. Brown L.F. Hibberd M.G. Grossman J.D. Morgan J.P. Simons M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1803-H1811PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Flt-1 and Flk-1/KDR mRNAs are markedly up-regulated in ischemic regions of tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme (8Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4163) Google Scholar, 18Plate K.H. Breier G. Weich H.A. Risau W. Nature. 1992; 359: 845-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (2122) Google Scholar, 19Phillips H.S. Armanini M. Stavrou D. Ferrara N. Westphal M. Int. J. Oncol. 1993; 2: 913-919PubMed Google Scholar). However, in vitro studies have yielded conflicting findings. Although Thieme et al. (20Thieme H. Aiello L.P. Ferrara N. King G.L. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 98-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that hypoxia increases VEGF receptor number by 50% in cultured bovine retinal capillary endothelial cells, the levels of Flk-1/KDR mRNA appeared to be down-regulated. Also, while an up-regulation of Flt-1 mRNA in response to hypoxia was found in cultured pericytes (21Takagi H. King G.L. Aiello L.P. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1016-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) or in microvessels in skin explants (22Detmar M. Brown L.F. Berse B. Jackman R.W. Elicker R.W. Dvorak H.F. Claffey K.P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 263-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), others failed to detect a similar up-regulation of Flt-1 in human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells (23Waltenberger J. Mayr U., S., P. Hombach V. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Brogiet al. (24Brogi E. Schatteman G. Wu T. Kim E.A. Varticovski L. Keyt B. Isner J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) reported that the Flk-1/KDR mRNA is not directly induced by hypoxia in HUVE cells or in microvascular endothelial cells. It has been suggested that the in vivoup-regulation of Flk-1/KDR receptor expression is mediated by a paracrine factor released by ischemic tissues (24Brogi E. Schatteman G. Wu T. Kim E.A. Varticovski L. Keyt B. Isner J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) or by post-transcriptional mechanisms such as increased mRNA stability (23Waltenberger J. Mayr U., S., P. Hombach V. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Using real time RT-PCR technology, we found an up-regulation of theFlt-1 expression compared with the Flk-1/KDR in HUVE cells. Sequence analysis of the mouse and human Flt-1 promoter revealed a heptamer element highly homologous to the HIF consensus sites present in the 5′-region of mouse and human VEGF genes and the 3′-enhancer of the human EPO gene. So far, such a homologous element could be found neither in the human nor in the mouseFlk-1 promoter sequences available. In the present study, we provide evidence that a 40-bp sequence including such an element is sufficient to confer hypoxia inducibility when tested in a heterologous promoter context and revealed enhancer-like features. These differences in the regulation further emphasize the different roles played by these receptors in mediating VEGF biological responses. A 129Sv/ev male genomic library in λGEM-11 vector (Promega, Madison, WI), generated by partial Sau3A digestion, was screened with a set of overlapping oligonucleotides covering the 5′-end of the leader sequences of the mouse Flt-1 andFlk-1 gene, respectively (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide probes used to isolate the mouse Flt-1 gene were mFlt-1 probe 1 and probe 2. For the mouse Flk-1 gene, oligonucleotide mFlk-1 probe 1 and probe 2 were radioactively labeled after annealing in a Klenow fill-in reaction (DNA Polymerase I, Large (Klenow) fragment (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For sequences of oligonucleotides, see Table I. All enzymes used were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), unless otherwise indicated. 16 pmol of each oligonucleotide was present in 20 μl of 10 mmTris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, heated for 10 min at 55 °C, and allowed to cool for 10 min at room temperature. The mixture was made 100 μm for dGTP, dTTP, and dATP. 2 units of Klenow fragment were then added, and the total volume was adjusted to 50 μl. The labeling reaction occurred at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 50 μCi of [32P]dCTP (3000 mCi/mmol, Amersham Corp. Three overlapping but not identical clones of each gene were isolated. The restriction maps of these genes were generated using the partial restriction method (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) (data not shown). Fragments were cloned into pBluescript KS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A 3.5-kb NcoI fragment of the Flt-1 gene and a 2.1-kb PstI fragment from the Flk-1 phages were subcloned into pGEM5 or pSK to generate pGEM5Flt-1(NcoI) and pSKFlk-1(PstI), respectively. Sequencing reactions were performed in an automatic sequencer (model 373A, Applied BioSystems, Foster City, CA). Both strands of the Flt-1 promoter including the region from −3181 to +352 and the region between −1824 and +148 of the Flk-1 promoter were sequenced by cycle sequencing. Sequence analysis was done using the Sequencher 3.1 program (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI).Table ISequences of oligonucleotide primers and real time RT-PCR probesmFlt-1 probe 1GGT CAG CTG CTG GGA CAC CGC GGT CTT GCC TTA CGC GCT GCT CGG GTG TCT GCmFlt-1 probe 2GGC ACT TTT AAC TTC GAC CCT GAG CCA TAT CCT GTG AGA AGC AGA CAC CCG AGC AGC GCGmFlk-1 probe 1GGG GCC ATA CCG CCT CTG TGA CTT CTT TGC GGG CCA GGG ACG GAG AAG GAG TCT GmFlk-1 probe 2CTC CCT GGG CAC AGA GCC CAG TTT CTC AGG CAC AGA CTC CTT CTC CGT CCCmFlt-HIE30–1TCG CCA ATT GAG GAA CAA CGT GGA ATT AGT GTC ATGmFlt-HIE30–2TCG ACA TGA CAC TAA TTC CAC GTT GTT CCT CAA TTGmFlt-HIE40–1GAT CCT GCA TAA TTG AGG AAC AAC GTG GAA TTA GTG TCA TCG TAA GmFlt-1HIE40–2TCG ACT TAC GAT GAC ACT AAT TCC ACG TTG TTC CTC AAT TAT GCA GmFlt-HIE50–1TCG AGA TGG ATG CAT AAT TGA GGA ACA AGC TGG AAT TAG TGT CAT CGT AAA TGA TCmFlt-HIE50–2ACG TGA TCA TTT ACG ATG ACA CTA ATT CCA CGT TGT TCC TCA ATT ATGmFlt-HIE50–234A1TCG AGA TGG ATG CAT AAT TGA GGA ACA AAA AGG AAT TAG TGT CAT CGT AAA TGA TCmFlt-HIE50–234A2ACG TGA TCA TTT ACG ATG ACA CTA ATT CCT TTT TGT TCC TCA ATT ATG CAT CCA TChEPOHIE-1TCG AGG CCC TAC GTG CTG TCT CAC ACA GCC TGT TCT GAC CTC TCG ACC TAC CGG CChEPOHIE-2TCG AGG CCG GTA GGT CGA GAG GTC AGA ACA GGC TGT GTG AGA CAG CAC GTA GGG CChVEGFHIE-1TCG AGC ACA GTG CAT ACG TGG GCT TCC ACA ChVEGFHIE-2TCG AGT GTG GAA GCC CAC GTA TGC ACT GTG CmFlt-1HIE264.FGAC TAC GCG TCA CGG GTA TCT GGC AGG TTC TAmFlt-1HIE264.RGAC TAC GCG TGA AAC GCT GGA TGG AAA ACA AAmFlt-1HIE100.FGAC TAC GCG TCC GGG ACG ACT TCA GCC TmFlt-1HIE100.RGAC TAC GCG TGG GTG AAA TTA ACT TGA GAC ACT AGA TCHUMKDR 2530.FGGC CAA GAG ATT GAA GCA GAT CHUMKDR 3043.RACT TTC GCG ATG CCA AGA ACT CHUMKDR 2872.FP5′(FAM)-ACT GGT GAT GCT GTC CAA GCG CCG TTT-(TAMRA)p3′HSFLT 2689.RCCC ACT TGC TGG CAT CAT AAG GHSFLT 2228.FCAC CAT ACC TCC TGC GAA ACC THSFLT 2549.FP5′(FAM)-TGG CTG CGA CTC TCT TCT GGC TCC TAT-(TAMRA)p3′ Open table in a new tab Primary cultures of HUVE cells were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Cells were maintained in the presence of endothelial growth medium (EGM; Clonetics). EGM consists of endothelial basic medium plus 0.1 ng/ml recombinant human EGF, 10 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 500 μg/ml gentamycin, 500 ng/ml amphotericin B, 12 μg/ml bovine brain extract, and 2% fetal bovine serum. 24 h before exposure to hypoxia, cells were trypsinized and plated on gelatinized 10-cm culture dishes to a density of 8.8 × 103 cells/cm2. Dishes were then floated with preanalyzed gas mixture for 20 min and kept in 0% O2, 5% CO2, and 95% N2 at 37 °C for various durations. Oxygen concentration in the incubators was monitored by a portable oxygen analyzer (Teldyne Brown Engineering, San Leandro, CA). HeLa cells (ATCC number CRL 7923) were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Hep3B cells (ATCC number HB-8064) were grown in minimal essential medium with Earle's salts with nonessential amino acids, without glutamine (Life Technologies), complemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For transient expression in Hep3B cells, 0.5 μg of test DNA and 0.5 μg of reference template were added to each well of six-well plates. Cells were at a density of 0.5 × 106/well. Plasmid DNA was prepared by using commercial kits (Qiagen, Santa Clara, CA) and introduced into cells by electroporation with a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) at 260 V and 960 microfarads following the manufacturer's instructions. Quadruplicate electroporations were pooled and split into six-well plates with 5 ml of medium in each well. Cells were then allowed to recover for 24 h in a 5% CO2, 95% air incubator at 37 °C. Following medium change, triplicate wells were placed in a hypoxic (0% O2, 5% CO2) or in a normoxic (5% CO2, air) incubator for the indicated duration of time. Cell extracts were generated by incubation in 500 μl of 1 × passive lysis buffer solution (dual luciferase assay; Promega) at room temperature for 15 min and frozen at −70 °C. 10 μl of the extracts were analyzed in a luminometer (TD-20e, Turner Designs, Inc., Mountain View, CA) using the reagents provided in the kit. Light production was measured for 15 s, and results were expressed as relative light units (RLU). The mean RLU was corrected with the signals obtained from the reference constructs. The relative luciferase activity (mean ± S.E.) was calculated as luciferase (RLU)/Renilla luciferase (RLU). 1 μg of test DNA and 0.1 μg/well CMV-RLluciferase control vector (dual luciferase assay; Promega) were used for transient transfection of 0.2 × 106 HeLa cells/well in six-well plates. Immediately before the addition of the DNA-liposome complex, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The plasmid DNA mix was then added to a 15-ml Falcon tube containing 0.1 ml of Opti-MEM1 and mixed. 10 μl of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) were added to another 15-ml tube containing 0.1 ml of Optim-MEM1 and mixed. Plasmid DNA and Lipofectin were mixed and incubated at room temperature to allow the complex to form. After 15 min, the DNA-liposomal complex was diluted with 0.8 ml of Opti-MEM1 (Life Technologies, Inc.), mixed, and layered gently on top of the cells. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 14–16 h. After removal of the DNA-liposome mixture, 3 ml of complemented medium was added 24 h before exposure to hypoxia. For final luciferase assay, cells were lysed in 200-μl passive lysis buffer (Promega). Cell lysates were then transferred into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 1 min at 4 °C. Luciferase andRenilla luciferase activity were measured by mixing 20 μl of extract with 100 μl of luciferase assay buffer and the subsequent addition of 100 μl of Stop and Glow solution, respectively. To generate the luciferase reporter vector containing the mouseFlt-1 promoter, the KpnI-XhoI promoter fragment was ligated into the KpnI and XhoI sites of pGL2-basic plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). This resulted in the Flt-1-(−2778/+209)-luc construct. A series of 5′-promoter deletions were then generated by double digestion with various restriction enzymes followed by blunt end reaction and religation by standard cloning techniques (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For the Flt-1-(−1464/+209)-luc construct,KpnI and PvuII were used; for Flt-1-(−977/+209)-luc KpnI and NsiI. For Flt-1-(−547/+209)-luc, KpnI and AflII were used, and for the Flt-1-(−202/+209)-luc construct, KpnI andBssHI were used (see Fig. 4 A). The constructs mFlt-HIE50, HIE40, HIE30, HIE50–234A, hEPO HIE, and hVEGF HIE were made by ligation of the corresponding oligonucleotide set into the SalI site 2.8 kb upstream of the SV40 promoter (“enhancer” position) or into the XhoI site (“promoter” position) of the pGL2SV40prom vector (Promega). For oligonucleotide sequences, see Table I. Phosphorylation of 50 pmol of the corresponding oligonucleotide set was carried out in 70 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm rATP (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for 1 h at 37 °C in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixture was heated for 10 min at 65 °C and slowly cooled to room temperature. 0.1 μl of this mix was used in ligation reactions. Constructs mFlt-1HIE264 and mFlt-1HIE100 were generated by PCR (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) of pGEM5Flt-1(NcoI) using the oligonucleotides mFlt-1HIE264.F and mFlt-1HIE264.R and oligonucleotides mFlt-1HIE100.F and mFlt-1HIE100.R, respectively. The PCR products were subcloned into pSK to generate pSKmFlt-1HIE264 and pSKmFlt-1HIE100, respectively. The inserts were cut by BamHI and SalI and cloned in “enhancer” position in pGL2prom, as above described. To clone these inserts in “promoter” position in pGL2SV40prom, they were cut withXhoI and SacI and then cloned into theXhoI site of the reporter plasmid. All constructs were analyzed by restriction digestion analysis and partial sequencing. HUVE cells from pooled donors were cultured as described under “Cell Cultures.” Cells were initially expanded for 8–10 days in the presence of EGM. 38 h prior to exposure to hypoxia, cells were split and seeded at a density of 100,000 cells/well in six-well plates in EGM. Immediately prior to hypoxic incubation (0% O2, 5% CO2, 95% N2), cells were washed once, and then 5 ml of assay medium (endothelial basic medium plus 2% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 500 μg/ml gentamycin, 0.5 μg/ml amphotericin-B) was added to each well. After incubations of various duration, cells were harvested by the STAT 60 method (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX), and total RNA was prepared according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The RNA was dissolved in 50 μl of H2O, and its concentration was determined by spectrophotometer (A 260). To monitor gene expression, we used real time RT-PCR analysis. This novel approach has been described previously (26Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (5020) Google Scholar, 27Gibson U.E.M. Heid C.A. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). Briefly, a gene-specific PCR oligonucleotide primer pair defines the “amplicon.” Within the amplicon, an oligonucleotide probe labeled with a reporter fluorescent dye (FAM) at the 5′-end and a quencher fluorescent dye (TAMRA) at the 3′-end are designed. When the probe is intact, the reporter dye emission is quenched. During the extension phase of the PCR cycle, the nucleolytic activity of the DNA polymerase cleaves the hybridization probe and releases the reporter dye from the probe. Fluorescence intensity produced during PCR amplifications is monitored by the sequence detector directly in the reaction tube (“real time”). A computer algorithm compares the amount of reporter dye emission with the quenching dye emission and calculates the threshold cycle number (C T), when signals reach 10 times the standard deviation of the base line. It was demonstrated that the calculated C T values are a quantitative measurement for the mRNA levels of various genes tested (27Gibson U.E.M. Heid C.A. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). 100 ng of total RNA was added to a 50-μl RT-PCR reaction (PCR-Access, Promega). The reaction master mix was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol to give final concentrations of 1 × avian myeloblastosis virus/Tfl reaction buffer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgSO4, 0.1 unit/ml avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, 0.1 unit/μlTfl DNA polymerase, 250 nm concentration of the primers, and 200 nm concentration of the corresponding probe, as described by Gibson et al. (27Gibson U.E.M. Heid C.A. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). Primers and probes for real time PCR analysis of Flt-1 andFlk-1/KDR genes were designed by the Oligo version 4.0 program (National Bioscience, Plymouth, MN), according to Heid et al. (26Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (5020) Google Scholar). For sequences of all oligonucleotides used, see TableI. The primers for the humanFlk-1/KDR gene were HUMKDR 2530.F and HUMKDR 3043.R, and the probe was HUMKDR 2872.FP. For Flt-1 analysis, the following primers were used: HSFLT 2689.R and HSFLT 2228.F; the probe was HSFLT 2549.FP. Primers and probes were synthesized at Genentech using conventional nucleic acid synthesis chemistry. The β-actin primer and probe (TaqMan β-actin detection reagents) were purchased from Perkin-Elmer and Applied Biosystems. RT-PCR reactions and the resulting relative increase in reporter fluorescent dye emission were monitored in real time by the 7700 sequence detector (Perkin-Elmer). Signals were analyzed by the sequence detector 1.0 program (Perkin-Elmer). Conditions were as follows: 1 cycle at 48 °C for 45 min, 1 cycle at 94 °C for 2 min, 40 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 2 min. Data were generated as indicated in the legend to Fig. 1. To determine whether the VEGF receptors are directly regulated by hypoxia in endothelial cells, primary HUVE cells were incubated in hypoxic conditions (0% O2, 5% CO2) and analyzed for VEGF receptor gene expression by real time quantitative RT-PCR analysis (27Gibson U.E.M. Heid C.A. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). In two independent experiments conducted with different HUVE cell preparations derived from different donors,Flt-1 levels were induced 4.2 ± 0.8-fold after 32 h of growth in hypoxia. Expression levels for Flk-1/KDR were unchanged or weakly down-regulated at the same time point. Time course experiments revealed a 2–3-fold stimulation of Flt-1 after 60 h in hypoxia (Fig.1 A), whereas theFlk-1/KDR levels were moderately down-regulated during the same period (Fig. 1 B). Initial Northern blot experiments yielded essentially similar results (data not shown). To test if the differential regulation of the VEGF receptor genes is due to transcriptional regulatory regions, promoter regions located upstream of both genes were isolated and tested for their ability to respond to hypoxia in fusion constructs with the luciferase gene. To isolate the 5′-flanking region of the murine Flk-1 andFlt-1 genes, a genomic DNA library from 129Sv/ev mice was screened using probes corresponding to the signal peptide sequence of their respective gene products. For each receptor gene, three independent phage clones were isolated and analyzed by restriction mapping. To exclude the possibility of recombination artifacts, genomic DNA from 129/SvJ mice (Stratagene) was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization and showed identical restriction fragments (data not shown). A 3.4-kb KpnI/NcoI Flt-1 and a 2.1-kbPstI Flk-1/KDR were subcloned into pSK vector (Stratagene) and used for further analysis. The nucleotide sequence of the KDR/Flk-1 promoter region (−1829/+148) and the comparison with the human sequence (−780/+148) (28Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.-E. Haber E.

We have isolated a cDNA encoding a novel protein kinase that has significant homology (57% amino acid identity) to human p38α/CSBP. The novel kinase, p38δ, has a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein of 365 amino acids with a putative TGY dual phosphorylation motif. Dot-blot analysis of p38δ mRNA in 50 human tissues revealed a distribution profile of p38δ that differs from p38α. p38δ is highly expressed in salivary gland, pituitary gland, and adrenal gland, whereas p38α is highly expressed in placenta, cerebellum, bone marrow, thyroid gland, peripheral leukocytes, liver, and spleen. Like p38α, p38δ is activated by cellular stress and proinflammatory cytokines. p38δ phosphorylates ATF-2 and PHAS-I, but not MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 and -3, knownin vivo and in vitro substrates of p38α. We also observed that p38δ was strongly activated by MKK3 and MKK6, while p38α was preferentially activated by MKK6. Other experiments showed that a potent p38α kinase inhibitor AMG 2372 minimally inhibited the kinase activity of p38δ. Taken together, these data indicate that p38δ is a new member of the p38 MAPK family and that p38δ likely has functions distinct from that of p38α.

Goedert M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of p38γ/ERK6/SAPK3 is 60% identical to p38α (40Lechner C. Zahalka M.A. Giot J.-F.

Here we report the isolation of a novel p38 MAPK (p38δ) with a TGY motif in its activation domain. p38δ was characterized with regard to tissue distribution, stimulus activation, MKK activation, substrate specificity, and inhibitor sensitivity. These studies reveal interesting similarities as well as differences in the properties of p38δ as compared with p38α. Recombinant GST-c-Jun protein was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Recombinant PHAS-I protein was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). ATF-2 was amplified by PCR from human skeletal muscle cDNA using two primers (5′-CATATGCAATACAAGGACCTGTGGAAT-3′ and 5′-CCTCCGCTCGAGTTATAGAGGCATTTTTTTAATGTCATC-3′) and cloned into bacterial expression vector pAMG21. Recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain FM15 and purified by S-Sepharose and Q-Sepharose chromatography. MAPKAP kinase-2 was amplified by PCR from human monocyte cDNA using two primers (5′-ACAACAGGATCCCAGATCAAGAAGAAC GCCATC-3′ and 5′-ACAACACTCGAGTCCTGTAGAGAGTTATTGCTT-3′). MAPKAP kinase-3 was amplified by PCR from a human lung cDNA library using two primers (5′-CTCGCTGAATTCGATGGTGAAACAGCAGAGGAGCAG-3′ and 5′-CCGGAGGTCGACCTACTGGTTGTTGCAGCCCTGTG-3′). The resulting PCR products were cloned separately into a GST fusion vector, pGEX-4T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). GST-MAPKAP kinase-2 and -3 were expressed in E. coli strain BL2/DE3 (Pharmacia), and fusion protein was purified over a glutathione column (Pharmacia). MKK3 was amplified by PCR from human skeletal muscle cDNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) with two primers (5′-ACAACAATCTAGAAGGAGGAATAACATATGGCTCATCATCATCATCATCATTCCAAGCCACCCGCACCCAC-3′ and 5′-TCCCGCTCGAGCTATGAGTCTTCTCCCAGGAT-3′) and then cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To generate constitutively active MKK3 (ca-MKK3), site-directed mutagenesis (43Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) was used to replace Ser-189 and Ser-193 with Glu. This DNA was cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 (Invitrogen) and expressed in Hi-5 cells. Recombinant ca-MKK3 was purified by hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) followed by Phenyl-Sepharose HP (Pharmacia) chromatography. To generate human FLAG-tagged p38α, two primers from the published nucleotide sequences (14Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R.

Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar) were used in PCR with human peripheral blood leukocyte cDNA as templates. The PCR product was then cloned into mammalian expression vector pCMVXVβ5. HA-tagged MKK6 in pME vector (31Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y.

An expressed sequence tag (EST) (311 base pairs) with homology to p38 was identified in the Amgen EST data base. Gene-specific forward and reverse primers were designed from the EST sequence and used in PCR to clone full-length cDNA with the Marathon-Ready human fetal brain cDNA templates (CLONTECH) following the manufacturer's protocol. These Marathon-Ready cDNAs have adaptors ligated at the 5′ and 3′ ends. The gene-specific forward primer (5-GAGCTGTCCAAGACCTACGTGTC-3′) and an adaptor primer (CLONTECH) were used in combination to amplify the 3′ portion of p38δ. The gene-specific reverse primer (5′-CTGGGGTGAAGACATCCAGG-3′) and the adaptor primer were used to amplify the 5′ portion of p38δ. PCR was performed for 30 cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 42 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 20 s) followed by an extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The resulting PCR product was ligated into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced on both strands. A second murine EST sequence (GenBankTM accession number W53837) that has homology to the Amgen EST sequence was identified in the GenBank data base. This EST fragment was used as a probe to screen a human macrophage library, and two clones were isolated. Sequencing of one of the clones revealed an identical open reading frame as the one cloned by PCR. The clone isolated from human fetal brain library was used for subsequent studies described here. Full-length p38δ cDNA was cloned into a mammalian expression vector PCR3.1 (Invitrogen) by PCR using two primers (5′-ACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGAGCCTCATCCGGAAAAAGGGCTTCTACAAG-3′ and 5′-ACCTGCAGGCGATTCTCCAGAT-3′). The first primer added a FLAG epitope at the 5′ end. PCR site-directed mutagenesis (43Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) was used to create a p38δ mutant (AGF) by substituting Thr-180 and Tyr-182 with an Ala and a Phe, respectively. The inserts were completely sequenced to make sure that no PCR errors were introduced. A Northern blot filter containing poly(A)+ RNA from multiple tissues and a normalized Master blot filter containing mRNA from 50 different tissues (CLONTECH) were probed with a32P-labeled DNA fragment generated from the 5′ portion of the coding region of p38δ (nucleotides 1 to 550). Hybridization was performed at 68 °C in ExpressHyb Buffer (CLONTECH) followed by two washes in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. Blots were exposed overnight at −70 °C. The same Northern blot was then probed with a 32P-labeled DNA fragment generated from the 5′ portion of the coding region of p38α using identical hybridization and washing conditions. 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin. For transfection, 2 × 106 cells were plated onto 100-mm dishes 16–20 h before transfection. DNA (2.0 μg of p38δ, 8.0 μg of all other DNAs) was transfected into 293 cells using LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected cells were incubated for 5 h in serum-free DMEM, further incubated in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum, and harvested 48 h after transfection. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (45Wang X.S. Diener K. Jannuzzi D. Trollinger D. Tan T.-H. Lichenstein H. Zukowski M. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31607-31611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were dislodged into lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Igepal, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 0.2 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA) and sedimented (15,000 × g for 60 min) to remove insoluble debris. Total protein in cell lysates was quantified by the Bradford method using a protein assay kit (Pierce). Supernatants containing 100 μg of protein were immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of anti-HA mAb 12CA5 (Berkeley Antibody Co., Berkeley, CA) or anti-FLAG M2 mAb (Sigma) and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Pharmacia). For Western blot analysis, lysates containing equal amounts of total protein were resolved by 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were then probed with mAb M2, followed by biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Life Science Inc.) and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Life Science Inc.). Cells transfected with FLAG-tagged p38δ or p38α were lysed, and recombinant protein was immunoprecipitated using mAb M2 and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, once with kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4), and resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer. The beads were then incubated with ATF-2 and 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) at 30 °C for 30 min. Reaction mixtures were then resuspended in 2 × sample buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 6% SDS, 20% glycerol) and boiled for 3 min. Phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, after which the gels were dried and exposed to radiographic film. To determine the substrate and inhibitor specificity of p38δ and p38α, the kinases were first activated in vitro with ca-MKK3. Activation was performed in the presence of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 50 nm calyculin A, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μm ATP, 75 μg/ml ca-MKK3, and approximately 20 μg/ml p38δ or p38α. The reaction (60 min at 28 °C) was terminated by washing the p38-bound immunoprecipitates three times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. Substrate specificity studies were performed in kinase buffer (40-μl reactions; 30 min at 28 °C) with 2 μm cold ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), no ca-MKK3, approximately 1 μg/ml p38δ or p38α, and 50 μg/ml of either full-length GST-ATF-2, GST-c-Jun, GST-MAPKAP kinase-2, GST-MAPKAP kinase-3, or PHAS-I. To evaluate the sensitivities of p38α and p38δ to AMG 2372, 40-μl kinase reactions (15 min at 28 °C) were performed as described for substrate reactions, except that ATF-2-(1–109) was used as substrate in the presence of various inhibitor concentrations. Reactions were terminated by boiling in the presence of 2 × sample buffer. The reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE, visualized by autoradiography, and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To identify novel MAPKs, we searched the Amgen EST data base with the p38 nucleotide sequences as the query sequences. One partial human cDNA sequence (311 base pairs) was identified that has homology to p38α. Through PCR and hybridization techniques, we isolated a full-length cDNA corresponding to this EST sequence. The novel cDNA is predicted to encode a protein of 365 amino acids with a molecular mass of 42 kDa (Fig. 1 A). The deduced amino acid sequence predicts a protein kinase with all 11 characteristic kinase subdomains (Fig. 1 B). GenBankTM and European Molecular Biology Laboratory Data base searches identified p38α/CSBP2 (14Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) as the most closely related molecules. p38δ displays 57, 55, and 62% amino acid identity to p38α/CSBP2, p38β, and p38γ/ERK6, respectively. p38δ has a putative dual phosphorylation motif (TGY) in kinase subdomain VIII similar to that found in other p38 family members. The amino acid sequence alignment of p38δ with human p38α/CSBP2, p38β, and p38γ/ERK6 is shown in Fig. 1 B. The expression of p38δ was examined in a variety of human tissues by Northern blot analysis using a probe derived from the 5′ end of p38δ. The p38δ probe hybridized strongly to a transcript of approximately 1.8 kilobases and weakly to a transcript of 6.0 kilobases, while a probe derived from p38α hybridized to a single transcript of 4.1 kilobases (14Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The same p38δ probe was used to hybridize a human RNA master blot containing poly (A)+ RNAs from 50 different human tissues. The RNAs in this blot have been normalized to the mRNA levels of eight different housekeeping genes; thus the relative levels of mRNA in different tissues could be determined. Among the tissues examined, strong hybridizing signals were observed in exocrine/endocrine tissues including human salivary gland, pituitary gland, adrenal gland, and placenta (Fig.2 A). Moderate signals were observed in pancreas, trachea, thyroid gland, stomach, prostate, colon, small intestine, lymph node, kidney, and lung. Probing the master blot with p38α DNA revealed a different tissue distribution profile. Strong hybridizing signals were found in placenta, cerebellum, bone marrow, thyroid gland, peripheral leukocyte, liver, and spleen. Moderate signals were found in occipital lobe, fetal liver, pituitary gland, adrenal gland, aorta, uterus, stomach, lymph node, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and thymus (Fig. 2 B). Probing the master blot with p38β DNA found that p38β is abundantly expressed in brain tissues such as hippocampus, frontal lobe, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, caudate nucleus, medulla oblongata, whole brain, and fetal brain (Fig. 2 C). Interestingly, probing the master blot with p38γ DNA found that it has a very limited tissue distribution profile. p38γ was highly expressed in skeletal muscle, while the expression in other tissues appears to be low (Fig. 2 D). Full-length p38δ cDNA and p38α were cloned into mammalian expression vectors with a FLAG epitope sequence added at the 5′ end and transfected into 293 cells. Transfected cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a FLAG mAb. The immunoprecipitated p38δ and p38α were activated using recombinant ca-MKK3, washed, and used in immune complex kinase assays with various substrates. As shown in Fig.3, p38δ and p38α phosphorylated full-length ATF-2 (lanes 1 and 6) and PHAS-I (lanes 5 and 10), but not c-Jun (lanes 2 and 7), a known substrate for JNK (6Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar). We also observed that p38δ showed minimal phosphorylating activity against MAPKAP kinase-2 and -3 (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4), while p38α phosphorylated these substrates efficiently (Fig. 3,lanes 8 and 9). Control lysates did not phosphorylate any of the substrates (data not shown). The p38 group of kinases can be activated by a variety of stress stimuli and proinflammatory cytokines (13Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar, 14Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). Because p38δ is closely related to p38α, we determined whether similar stimuli could activate p38δ kinase activity. 293 cells were transiently transfected with either p38δ or p38α cDNA and treated with various stimuli. p38δ and p38α activity was measured by their ability to phosphorylate ATF-2-(1–109) in an immune complex assay. As shown in Fig. 4 A, p38δ was strongly activated by H2O2, UV, NaCl, and Na3VO4 and moderately activated by anisomycin, IL-1β, TNFα, and epidermal growth factor. p38α was strongly activated by UV, NaCl, H2O2, and anisomycin and moderately activated by TNFα, IL-1β, and epidermal growth factor (C). A notable difference is that Na3VO4 strongly activated p38δ (Fig.4 A, lane 5) but not p38α (Fig. 4 C,lane 5). To eliminate the possibility that changes in p38 kinase activity are due to the variations in protein expression, Western blot analysis was performed. Fig. 4, B andD, shows that similar amounts of p38 were expressed under all conditions tested. MAPKs are activated by upstream MKK kinases. To determine which MKK(s) can activate p38δ, we co-transfected 293 cells with vectors encoding p38δ and MKK3, MKK4, or MKK6 and then assayed p38δ kinase activity in an immune complex assay. In repeated experiments, co-transfection of cells with p38δ and MKK3 or MKK6 resulted in strong activation of p38δ activity (Fig.5 A, lanes 2 and4), whereas co-transfection of p38δ with MKK4 had little effect (Fig. 5 A, lane 3). Similar studies showed that MKK6 and MKK4 markedly activated p38α (Fig. 5 C,lanes 3 and 4), while MKK3 weakly activated p38α (Fig. 5 C, lane 2). Western blot analysis indicated that p38δ and p38α were expressed at similar levels under all conditions tested (Fig. 5, B and D). MAPKs are activated by dual phosphorylation at the Thr-Xaa-Tyr motif within kinase subdomain VIII (18Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). To determine whether this motif is required for p38δ activation, we generated a mutant p38δ by replacing the Thr-Gly-Tyr motif with Ala-Gly-Phe (AGF mutant) and tested whether this mutant could be activated. Wild type p38δ phosphorylated ATF-2 when activated by UV irradiation (Fig.6 A, lane 4) or by co-transfection with MKK6 (Fig. 6 A, lane 7). However, the AGF mutant was unresponsive to UV stimulation (Fig.6 A, lane 6) or activation by upstream kinase MKK6 (Fig. 6 A, lane 8). Western blot analysis demonstrated that the AGF mutant was expressed to comparable levels as wild type p38δ (Fig. 6 B). p38δ and p38α from transfected cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with mAb M2 and activated in vitro using purified ca-MKK3. Excess ca-MKK3 was used to ensure that p38δ and p38α were maximally activated. Kinase assays were then performed in the presence of the indicated concentrations of AMG 2372. AMG 2372 only weakly inhibited the kinase activity of p38δ (Fig.7 A), whereas p38α kinase activity was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.7 B). At 1 μm inhibitor concentration, there was 98% inhibition of p38α (Fig. 7 B, lane 3), but less than 25% inhibition of p38δ (Fig. 7 A, lane 3). Similar results were obtained in three separate experiments. In this report, we describe the cloning and characterization of a novel member of the p38 group of protein kinases. p38δ has significant homology at the amino acid level to p38α, -β, and -γ and contains the dual phosphorylation TGY motif that is found in this p38 group of kinases (13Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar, 18Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). Mutation of the Thr and Tyr residues in the TGY motif abolished the kinase activity of p38δ and blocked UV or MKK6-induced activation. Thus, like other MAPKs, p38δ requires phosphorylation at the Thr and/or Tyr in the TGY motif for its activation. The tissue distribution of p38δ was examined in 50 different human tissues. The pattern of expression of p38δ mRNA is distinct from that of p38α, -β, and -γ. Very high levels of expression of p38δ mRNA were observed in human gland tissues, while p38α was abundantly expressed in placenta, brain (cerebellum), and lymphoid tissues. p38β is most abundantly expressed in brain tissues, while p38γ appears to have a limited tissue distribution. These differences in mRNA expression suggest that p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ may have tissue-specific functions. Similarities among p38δ, p38α, p38β, and p38γ prompted us to investigate whether p38δ can utilize the same substrates. p38δ phosphorylated ATF-2 and PHAS-I as efficiently as p38α, but not MAPKAP kinase-2 and -3 which are the physiological p38α substrates. This is also in contrast to the substrate profile of p38β which utilize similar substrates as p38α (39Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17920-17926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The p38γ could phosphorylate ATF-2 but was also far less effective in phophorylating MAPKAP kinase-2 and -3 (42Cuenda A. Cohen P. Buee-Scherrer V. Goedert M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Thus the substrate specificity of p38δ resembles that of p38γ. Similar to p38α, p38δ is activated in 293 cells by a diverse array of cellular stresses and proinflammatory cytokines. However, the degree of activation by various stimuli is different for p38δ as compared with p38α. Most notable was the strong activation of p38δ, but not of p38α by Na3VO4. Because Na3VO4 inhibits protein tyrosine phosphatase activity, our data suggest that such phosphatases differentially regulate the basal activity of p38δ and p38α. Differences in activation of p38δ versus p38α were also observed at the MKK level. In cell transfection experiments, p38δ is strongly activated by MKK3 and MKK6, whereas p38α is preferably activated by MKK6. These data suggest that regulators of p38δ overlap. Like p38α, it is likely that the dominant activator of p38δ in a given cell type will reflect the unique cellular environment. For example, it has been observed that MKK6 is the dominant activator of p38α in monocytes and KB cells, while MKK3 is the dominant activator of p38α in PC-12 cells (46Cuenda A. Alonso G. Morrice N. Jones M. Meier R. Cohen P. Nebreda A.R. EMBO J. 1997; 15: 4156-4164Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). p38α/CSBP has been directly linked to inflammatory cytokine production through the use of inhibitors that block its function. We tested one compound that blocks p38α activity and found that it was relatively inactive against p38δ. Thus, other compounds will have to be developed to determine if p38δ is involved in cytokine production. The critical substrates phosphorylated by p38α leading to cytokine production have not yet been elucidated, although several candidates have been discovered. Of this group, we showed that p38δ phosphorylated ATF-2 and PHAS-I, but not MAPKAP kinase-2 and -3. Additional studies are required to identify in vivo p38δ substrates and to determine if these substrates are involved in cytokine production or other p38δ-mediated processes.

We also thank members of Amgen EST Program who collectively have made significant contribution to the work."
https://openalex.org/W2108168031,"Mucin-type O-glycosylation is initiated by UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine:polypeptideN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (GalNAc-transferases). The role each GalNAc-transferase plays in O-glycosylation is unclear. In this report we characterized the specificity and kinetic properties of three purified recombinant GalNAc-transferases. GalNAc-T1, -T2, and -T3 were expressed as soluble proteins in insect cells and purified to near homogeneity. The enzymes have distinct but partly overlapping specificities with short peptide acceptor substrates. Peptides specifically utilized by GalNAc-T2 or -T3, or preferentially by GalNAc-T1 were identified. GalNAc-T1 and -T3 showed strict donor substrate specificities for UDP-GalNAc, whereas GalNAc-T2 also utilized UDP-Gal with one peptide acceptor substrate. Glycosylation of peptides based on MUC1 tandem repeat showed that three of five potential sites in the tandem repeat were glycosylated by all three enzymes when one or five repeat peptides were analyzed. However, analysis of enzyme kinetics by capillary electrophoresis and mass spectrometry demonstrated that the three enzymes react at different rates with individual sites in the MUC1 repeat. The results demonstrate that individual GalNAc-transferases have distinct activities and the initiation of O-glycosylation in a cell is regulated by a repertoire of GalNAc-transferases."
https://openalex.org/W2028746948,"The mechanism by which occupancy of collagen receptors is coupled to platelet activation has been uncertain. Our group previously demonstrated that glycoprotein (GP) VI, an uncharacterized platelet membrane protein, is specifically required for collagen-platelet interaction leading to activation of protein-tyrosine kinase Syk. Since collagen stimulation of platelets has recently been found to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Fc receptor (FcR) γ-chain, a signal-generating subunit of FcR, we further investigated the relationships between FcR γ-chain and GPVI in human platelets. Our present study revealed the following. FcR γ-chain was physically and stably associated with GPVI in human platelets; both FcR γ-chain and GPVI were proportionally absent in GPVI-deficient platelets; GPVI cross-linking or collagen stimulation of platelets resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of GPVI-associated FcR γ-chain accompanied by Syk association and activation. These findings strongly suggest that the associated complex of GPVI and FcR γ-chain is a collagen receptor featuring the signaling through immune receptors. The mechanism by which occupancy of collagen receptors is coupled to platelet activation has been uncertain. Our group previously demonstrated that glycoprotein (GP) VI, an uncharacterized platelet membrane protein, is specifically required for collagen-platelet interaction leading to activation of protein-tyrosine kinase Syk. Since collagen stimulation of platelets has recently been found to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Fc receptor (FcR) γ-chain, a signal-generating subunit of FcR, we further investigated the relationships between FcR γ-chain and GPVI in human platelets. Our present study revealed the following. FcR γ-chain was physically and stably associated with GPVI in human platelets; both FcR γ-chain and GPVI were proportionally absent in GPVI-deficient platelets; GPVI cross-linking or collagen stimulation of platelets resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of GPVI-associated FcR γ-chain accompanied by Syk association and activation. These findings strongly suggest that the associated complex of GPVI and FcR γ-chain is a collagen receptor featuring the signaling through immune receptors. Despite the widely accepted consensus that the interactions between the extracellular matrix protein collagen and platelets are vital for the maintenance of hemostasis, the exact nature of collagen receptor on platelets has been a great enigma to date except for well characterized integrin heterodimer α2β1 (1Hynes R.O.

GPVI cross-linking with the F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-GPVI IgG (F(ab′)2αGPVI) induces cAMP-insensitive activation of protein-tyrosine kinase Syk accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2) in a manner similar to collagen stimulation (8Ichinohe T.

However, the question of how GPVI is involved in collagen receptor and transduces signals leading to Syk activation accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 still remains unsolved. One of the mechanisms by which Syk is activated is achieved via interaction between its tandem Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and a tyrosine-phosphorylated activation motif, termed the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif, found in receptors of the immune system or their associated chains (11DeFranco A.L. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In platelets, this mechanism of Syk activation is a prerequisite for the activation through a low affinity Fc receptor for IgG (FcγR) (12Chacko G.W. Brandt J.T. Coggeshall K.M. Anderson C.L. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1991; 9: 457-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar), human platelets express only a single FcγR encoded by the FcγRIIA gene (15Chacko G.W. Duchemin A.-M. Coggeshall K.M.

FcR γ-chain has been shown to be associated with all three classes of FcγR, the high affinity IgE FcR (FcεRI) and the IgA FcR (FcαR), and the T-cell receptor-CD3 complex (14Ravetch J.V. Kinet J.P.

Since platelets express FcγRIIA but lack these other known FcR γ-chain-associated membrane proteins, FcR γ-chain may be associated with a novel counterpart in platelets. Therefore, we hypothesized that FcR γ-chain might associate with GPVI composing a collagen receptor and play a pivotal role in collagen-induced Syk activation through GPVI in human platelets. In testing this hypothesis, we studied the following points: whether a complex of FcR γ-chain and GPVI can be demonstrated in human platelets; how FcR γ-chain is present in GPVI-deficient platelets; whether GPVI cross-linking of platelets with F(ab′)2αGPVI induces tyrosine phosphorylation of FcR γ-chain and its association with Syk; and how GPVI is involved in the binding of the tandem SH2 domains of Syk to FcR γ-chain in collagen-stimulated platelets. Here we report that FcR γ-chain is physically and stably associated with platelet membrane GPVI but not expressed in GPVI-deficient platelets and also that GPVI cross-linking or collagen stimulation of platelets induces tyrosine phosphorylation of GPVI-associated FcR γ-chain accompanied by Syk association and activation.

Other reagents were from previously described sources (8Ichinohe T. Takayama H. Ezumi Y. Yanagi S. Yamamura H. Okuma M. J. Biol.

Takayama H. Ezumi Y. Yanagi S. Yamamura H. Okuma M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28029-28036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), using the serum of a patient with GPVI deficiency (6Sugiyama T. Okuma M. Ushikubi F. Sensaki S. Kanaji K. Uchino H. Blood. 1987; 69: 1712-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who was followed up as an outpatient in our department. For immunoblotting, anti-GPVI IgG was labeled with biotin using a standard method as described previously (26Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 340-341Google Scholar). Blood samplings were performed by venipuncture from healthy donors or from patients with GPVI-deficient platelets with informed consent. Anticoagulation of blood and preparation of washed platelets were performed as described previously (8Ichinohe T. Takayama H. Ezumi Y. Yanagi S. Yamamura H. Okuma M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28029-28036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Washed platelets (1.0 × 109 cells/ml) were stimulated with 150 μg/ml F(ab′)2αGPVI or 100 μg/ml collagen for the indicated times at 37 °C in an aggregometer with continuous stirring at 800 rpm. Unstimulated or stimulated platelets were lysed in an ice-cold lysis buffer (16Gibbins J. Asselin J. Farndale R. Barnes M. Law C.-L. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18095-18099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and immunoprecipitation of each specified protein was performed as described previously (8Ichinohe T.

Precipitation of platelet protein with GST-Syk-SH2 was performed as described previously (16Gibbins J. Asselin J. Farndale R. Barnes M. Law C.-L. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18095-18099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting analysis of whole platelet lysates, immunoprecipitated proteins, or precipitated proteins with GST-Syk-SH2 followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection was performed as described previously (8Ichinohe T.

When immunoblotting was performed with biotinylated anti-GPVI IgG, the blots were then incubated with avidin-horseradish peroxidase and developed with ECL. In some experiments, immunoblotted protein bands were measured by densitometry (Densitorol DMU-33C, Toyo Kagaku Sangyo Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Absorption of proteins in normal control samples was set to 100%. Washed erythrocytes were prepared and erythrocyte membranes were obtained by hemolysing cells as described previously (27Zipser Y. Kosower N.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Erythrocyte hemoglobin-free membrane was lysed in the lysis buffer. Washed granulocytes and lymphocytes were prepared with a modification of a previously described method (28Takayama H. Okuma M. Kanaji K. Sugiyama T. Sensaki S. Uchino H. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Med. 1983; 12: 261-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, after removing of platelet-rich plasma, erythrocytes were eliminated from the remaining blood by dextran sedimentation. The upper leukocyte layer was centrifuged over Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at 400 ×g for 30 min. Each granulocyte- or lymphocyte-containing fraction was taken and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Contaminating erythrocytes in the granulocyte pellets were lysed in hypotonic saline. The granulocytes or lymphocytes were further washed and lysed in the lysis buffer. Protein concentration in cell lysates was measured with BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). After addition of SDS sample buffer and boiling, the samples containing an equal amount of protein (20 μg/lane) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting as described above. We first examined whether there is physical association between FcR γ-chain and GPVI. Cell lysates of unstimulated washed platelets were prepared and tested for the interaction between FcR γ-chain and GPVI by immunoprecipitation, followed by immunoblotting with anti-FcR γ-chain serum and anti-GPVI IgG. When FcR γ-chain and associated proteins were immunoprecipitated from platelet cell lysates with anti-FcR γ-chain serum, GPVI was co-precipitated with FcR γ-chain (Fig. 1 A). Conversely, when GPVI and associated proteins were immunoprecipitated from platelet cell lysates with anti-GPVI IgG, FcR γ-chain was co-precipitated with GPVI (Fig. 1 B). Immunoblotting with anti-FcR γ-chain serum revealed the presence of an apparent doublet of FcR γ-chain, which has been observed previously (16Gibbins J. Asselin J. Farndale R. Barnes M. Law C.-L. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18095-18099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 29Duchemin A.-M. Ernst L.K. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12111-12117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We further studied the possible association of FcR γ-chain with integrin α2β1, FcγRII, or GPIV (CD36), which is another candidate for collagen receptor (3Tandon N.N. Kralisz U. Jamieson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7576-7583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unstimulated washed human platelets were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific to integrin α2β1, FcγRII, or GPIV. Immunoblotting with anti-FcR γ-chain serum revealed the absence of FcR γ-chain in those immunoprecipitates (Fig.1 B). These findings demonstrate that FcR γ-chain is physically associated with GPVI but not with integrin α2β1, FcγRII, or GPIV in human platelets. We then questioned how FcR γ-chain is present in GPVI-deficient platelets. Whole cell lysates of platelets obtained from a patient with complete GPVI deficiency (6Sugiyama T. Okuma M. Ushikubi F. Sensaki S. Kanaji K. Uchino H. Blood. 1987; 69: 1712-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were tested for the presence of FcR γ-chain by immunoblotting with anti-FcR γ-chain serum. Surprisingly, FcR γ-chain was not immunodetected with anti-FcR γ-chain serum in the GPVI-deficient platelets, indicating the complete deficiency of FcR γ-chain in these platelets (Fig.2 A). We next examined the presence of FcR γ-chain in the other peripheral blood cells such as granulocytes, lymphocytes, and erythrocytes obtained from the same patient (Fig. 2 B). The results showed that FcR γ-chain was normally present in those blood cells compared with normal control. Therefore, these data indicate that the expression of FcR γ-chain is altered specifically in GPVI-deficient platelets. This suggested to us that FcR γ-chain might associate only with GPVI and require GPVI for its expression in human platelets. If so, the amount of FcR γ-chain should be proportional to that of GPVI in human platelets. The same study as described above was then performed using another patient, who showed incomplete deficiency of GPVI in platelets (9Arai M. Yamamoto N. Moroi M. Akamatsu N. Fukutake K. Tanoue K. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 89: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis of the levels of FcR γ-chain and GPVI revealed that both FcR γ-chain and GPVI were approximately 10% normal in platelets (Fig.2 A), while FcR γ-chain was intact in the other peripheral blood cells (data not shown), demonstrating the proportional co-deficiency of FcR γ-chain with GPVI in GPVI-deficient platelets. Therefore, we concluded that both GPVI and FcR γ-chain were co-expressed in human platelets and that the lack of GPVI might cause the expression deficiency of FcR γ-chain. Although it has been reported that the expression of some of FcR requires the expression of FcR γ-chain (30Blank U. Ra C. Miller L. White K. Metzger H. Kinet J.P. Nature. 1989; 337: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 31Hibbs M.L. Salvaraj P. Carpen O. Springer T.A. Kuster H. Jouvin M.H. Kinet J.P. Science. 1989; 246: 1608-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), this may suggest another possibility that the expression of FcR γ-chain also requires its counterpart. We reported previously that the cross-linking of platelet GPVI with F(ab′)2αGPVI-induced activation of Syk in a similar manner to collagen stimulation (8Ichinohe T. Takayama H. Ezumi Y. Yanagi S. Yamamura H. Okuma M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28029-28036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore we questioned how GPVI-associated FcR γ-chain is involved in GPVI cross-linking or collagen-induced activation of Syk. Washed human platelets were stimulated with F(ab′)2αGPVI for various times up to 10 min and lysed for immunoprecipitation with anti-FcR γ-chain serum. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblotting analysis with anti-FcR γ-chain serum, anti-Syk antibody, anti-GPVI IgG, or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig.3, FcR γ-chain was tyrosine-phosphorylated in a time-dependent manner. Immunoblot analysis with anti-FcR γ-chain serum confirmed similar and specific efficiencies of immunoprecipitaion of FcR γ-chain. Protein-tyrosine kinase Syk became associated with FcR γ-chain in a time-dependent manner upon GPVI cross-linking, and the associated Syk was tyrosine-phosphorylated. During these events, FcR γ-chain was stably associated with GPVI. Similar findings were also obtained with collagen-stimulated platelets: collagen induced time-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of FcR γ-chain, which was stably associated with GPVI and recruited Syk (data not shown). Since parallel increases in the activity of Syk with its tyrosine-phosphorylated state are well known and also confirmed in our previous reports (8Ichinohe T. Takayama H. Ezumi Y. Yanagi S. Yamamura H. Okuma M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28029-28036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Ichinohe T. Takayama H. Ezumi Y. Arai M. Yamamoto N. Takahashi H. Okuma M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 63-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), these data strongly suggest that GPVI engagement including collagen stimulation causes tyrosine phosphorylation of FcR γ-chain, which is involved in recruitment and activation of Syk. It has been demonstrated that Syk binds tyrosine-phosphorylated FcR γ-chain through its tandem SH2 domains (11DeFranco A.L. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To show the relationships between GPVI, FcR γ-chain, and the tandem SH2 domains of Syk in collagen-stimulated platelets, we used GST-Syk-SH2. Following collagen stimulation, platelets were lysed and the lysates were incubated with GST-Syk-SH2. Precipitated proteins with GST-Syk-SH2 were resolved on SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting analysis with anti-FcR γ-chain serum, anti-GPVI IgG, or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig.4, the co-precipitation of FcR γ-chain with the fusion protein reached a maximum after 60 s of collagen stimulation and declined thereafter. Both GPVI and FcR γ-chain showed similar time-dependent appearances in the fusion protein precipitates, where FcR γ-chain was tyrosine-phosphorylated but GPVI was not (data not shown). Therefore, taken together with our previous findings that GPVI is specifically required for collagen-platelet interaction leading to Syk activation (8Ichinohe T. Takayama H. Ezumi Y. Yanagi S. Yamamura H. Okuma M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28029-28036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Ichinohe T. Takayama H. Ezumi Y. Arai M. Yamamoto N. Takahashi H. Okuma M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 63-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), these data indicate that collagen signals through GPVI, and induces tyrosine phosphorylation of its associated FcR γ-chain, followed by the recruitment of Syk through the tandem SH2 domains. FcR γ-chain has been widely accepted to be involved in immune responses in association with Fc receptors and T-cell receptor. Our present work demonstrates that FcR γ-chain is associated and co-expressed with a so far uncharacterized membrane GPVI in human platelets and that this novel association plays essential roles in tyrosine phosphorylation of FcR γ-chain followed by the association of Syk, which is triggered by signaling through GPVI upon collagen stimulation. This could emphasize that FcR γ-chain is involved not only in immune responses but also in a nonimmune response with a novel counterpart GPVI as shown here. Although we do not deny that GPVI may associate with more than one protein, our findings are relevant to the concept that the associated complex between GPVI and FcR γ-chain is a collagen receptor featuring the signaling through immune receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2028273026,"We have identified a new murine orphan member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, termed mCAR, that is closely related to the previously described human orphan MB67, referred to here as hCAR. Like hCAR, mCAR expression is highest in liver. In addition to the most abundant mCAR1 isoform, the mCAR gene expresses a truncated mCAR2 variant that is missing the C-terminal portion of the ligand binding/dimerization domain. The mCAR gene has 8 introns, and this mCAR2 variant is generated by a splicing event that skips the 8th exon. mCAR1, like hCAR, binds as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor to the retinoic acid response element from the promoter of the retinoic acid receptor β2 isoform. Consistent with its lack of a critical heterodimerization interface, the mCAR2 variant does not bind this site. Both mCAR1 and hCAR are apparently constitutive transcriptional activators. This activity is dependent on the presence of the conserved C-terminal AF-2 transcriptional activation motif. As expected from its inability to bind DNA, the mCAR2 variant neither transactivates by itself nor inhibits transactivation by hCAR or mCAR1.

The nuclear hormone receptor superfamily includes the receptors for a number of potent biological regulators, such as steroids, retinoids, and thyroid hormone. With the recent addition of nuclear prostaglandin receptors (1Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M.

Nature. 1996; 383: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar), there are now more than 15 genes in mammalian genomes that encode such conventional receptors. An even larger set of genes encodes the orphan receptors, which are related to the conventional receptors but do not have known ligands. Particularly since individual genes for superfamily members frequently encode more than one isoform as a consequence of either alternative promoter utilization or alternative mRNA splicing, the total number of proteins that belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily is large. The functions of the conventional receptors have been extensively characterized (4Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P.

The functions of the orphans are less well understood, although it is thought that they have crucial roles in a variety of processes. Thus, the profound effects of the knock out of the SF-1/FTZ-F1 (8Luo X. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 481-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar, 9Ikeda Y. Luo X. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 478-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or HNF-4 (10Chen W.S. Manova K. Weinstein D.C. Duncan S.A. Plump A.S. Prezioso V.R. Bachvarova R.F. Darnell J.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2466-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) genes demonstrate that both have essential developmental functions. The remarkable conservation of the Coup-TFs and other orphans in mammalian and non-mammalian species (11Laudet V. Hanni C. Coll J. Catzeflis F. Stehelin D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1003-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) provides a somewhat less direct, but compelling argument for an important role. Even in cases where specific functional information is limited, the fact that orphans frequently compete for DNA-binding sites recognized by conventional receptors suggests that they could modulate ligand-dependent signaling pathways. For example, the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) 1The abbreviations used are: RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RXR, 9-cis-retinoic acid receptors; RARE, retinoic acid response elements; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; TK, thymidine kinase; h, human; m, mouse. 1The abbreviations used are: RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RXR, 9-cis-retinoic acid receptors; RARE, retinoic acid response elements; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; TK, thymidine kinase; h, human; m, mouse. bind to several distinct types of sites as heterodimers with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptors (RXRs). A number of these sites are also bound by one or more orphans or other conventional receptors as monomers (e.g. ROR (12Tini M. Fraser R.A. Giguere V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20156-20161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)), homodimers (e.g. HNF-4 (13Galson D.L. Tsuchiya T. Tendler D.S. Huang L.E. Ren Y. Ogura T. Bunn H.F.

Gulick T. Choi H.-S. Martinoli M.G. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar)). Here we describe the isolation and characterization of the orphan receptor mCAR, which is also capable of interacting with retinoic acid response elements (RAREs). As a consequence of alternative splicing, the mCAR gene encodes two proteins, mCAR1 and mCAR2. mCAR1 is closely related to the previously described MB67 (24Baes M. Gulick T. Choi H.-S. Martinoli M.G. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), referred to here as hCAR. Like hCAR, mCAR1 heterodimerizes with RXR to bind RAREs of the DR-5 type and transactivates such elements in the absence of retinoids or any other exogenously added ligand. This transactivation is dependent on the conserved AF-2 transactivation motif, which is present at the C terminus of mCAR1. Thus, this motif is associated not only with ligand dependent transactivation, as previously demonstrated for conventional receptors, but also with the apparently ligand-independent transactivation observed with mCAR1 and several other orphan receptors. mCAR2 is truncated, lacking a C-terminal region of the conserved ligand binding/dimerization domain that includes both the AF-2 motif and a conserved element, referred to as the 9th heptad (25Forman B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1293-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) or the I box (26Perlmann T. Umesono K. Rangarajan P.N. Forman B.M. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 958-966PubMed Google Scholar), which is required for heterodimerization in other members of the receptor superfamily (e.g. Ref. 27Au-Fliegner M. Helmer E. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5725-5737Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As expected from the loss of this dimerization motif, mCAR2 does not bind DNA or interfere with transactivation by mCAR1. A number of mouse CAR cDNA clones were isolated from a liver cDNA library using an hCAR (MB67) probe. Of 9 independent clones examined in detail, 4 had an intact ligand-binding domain, as judged by comparisons to hCAR and other superfamily members. Three had an internal deletion of 107 amino acids. Representative sequences of these clones have been submitted to GenBank. One additional clone included 188 bp of intron derived sequences; it is unclear whether this clone corresponds to an authentic variant or a contaminating nuclear precursor. The mCAR2 sequence used for further experiments corresponds to the cDNA clone that had the most extensive 5′-untranslated sequences, and the internal deletion. To generate the mCAR1 sequence used, the deleted region in this mCAR2 clone was replaced with the corresponding fragment from a clone that did not carry the deletion. An mCAR probe was used to screen a mouse genomic library, and a single clone was obtained. A NotI fragment containing the entire mCAR gene and 5′- and 3′-flanking regions was subcloned and sequenced in its entirety. This sequence has been submitted to GenBank. A Northern blot containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA from a variety of tissues was obtained from CLONTECH, Inc. and hybridized sequentially with either a full-length mCAR probe or smaller probes generated by PCR. The N-terminal probe, consisting of 167 bp from the 5′-untranslated region, and the C-terminal probe, consisting of the last 200 bp of the mCAR1 coding region, were generated by PCR using the mCAR1 cDNA as a template (5′-untranslated region primers: 5′-TTCCTACCTACATATGGC-3′ and 5′-GACCCTGCTTTCCTTGAGAT-3′; C-terminal primers: 5′-AGTCGATCCTCCACTTCCAT-3′ and 5′-ACTGCAAATCTCCCCGAGCAGCG-3′). A 210-bp 3′-flanking probe extending from a position 130 bp downstream of the poly(A) addition site was generated by PCR using the genomic mCAR clone as template (primers: 5′-TAGGAGGTRGACTAGAGTTCCTTCT-3′ and 5′-GATTGAGATATTACTACTCCTTTCTTC-3′). Prior to each rehybridization, the membrane was exposed for at least 2 days to confirm the removal of the previous probe. Standard conditions (28) were used for mRNA based PCR with mouse liver mRNA as a template and primers from exons 7 and 9. For Southern analysis of the PCR products, probes corresponded to a restriction fragment containing the mCAR1 ligand-binding domain, or an shorter segment derived solely from exon 8. Standard conditions (28) were used for primer extension analysis with total mouse liver RNA, and the primer 5′-TGCCTCAGTGCCTGGAAAACAAGGGCCTTCTCTTGC-3′ derived from the mCAR 5′-untranslated region. For DNA binding studies, mCAR1, mCAR2, RAR, and RXR proteins were expressed using coupled in vitrotranscription and translation (Promega, Inc.). Standard conditions were used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays with the DR-5 response element from the RARβ2 promoter (the βRARE) as the probe, as described for hCAR (MB67) (24Baes M. Gulick T. Choi H.-S. Martinoli M.G. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were maintained and transfected using calcium phosphate or DEAE dextran (28). mCAR1 and mCAR2 expression vectors were generated by inserting appropriate fragments into the vector CDM8 (29Seed B. Nature. 1987; 329: 840-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), as described previously for hCAR (24Baes M. Gulick T. Choi H.-S. Martinoli M.G. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The luciferase reporter plasmid (22Gulick T. Cresci S. Caira T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11012-11016Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) contained three copies of the βRARE upstream of the TK promoter. The reporter plasmids with wild type and mutant versions of the RARβ2 promoter were obtained from Drs. Nadeem Moghal and Ben Neel, and were as described (30Moghal N. Neel B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3945-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Transfections also included the pTKGH control plasmid which directs expression of human growth hormone (31Selden R.F. Howie K.B. Rowe M.E. Goodman H.M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3173-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). For the TK reporter, pairs of 30-mm dishes were each transfected with 2 μg of reporter and pTKGH, and a total of 2 μg of mammalian expression vector. For the RARβ2 reporters, pairs of 30-mm dishes were each transfected with 1.5 μg of the reporter and the mammalian expression vector, and 2 μg of the pTKGH control. Transfections were carried out in media containing 10% charcoal-stripped serum, and luciferase activity was determined using the Promega luciferase assay system as described by the manufacturer. Luciferase values were normalized using the growth hormone expression directed by the TKGH internal control. To confirm expression of mutant derivatives of mCAR1, whole cell extracts were prepared from appropriately transfected COSM6 cells as described (32Ladias J.A.A. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardassis D. Cardot P. Cheng J. Zannis V. Cladaras C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15849-15860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COSM6 cells do not express endogenous CAR proteins. These extracts were supplemented with similarly prepared COSM6 expressed RXR and used for electrophoretic mobility shift analysis using standard conditions. Murine cDNA clones related to the previously described human orphan receptor MB67 (24Baes M. Gulick T. Choi H.-S. Martinoli M.G. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) were isolated from a mouse liver cDNA library. Based on the ability of these murine and human orphans to constitutively transactivate at least a subset of RAREs (see below), we refer to them as mCAR and hCAR. Two classes of cDNAs were obtained encoding proteins called mCAR1 and mCAR2. mCAR1 and hCAR share a high degree of sequence identity throughout the DNA and ligand binding/dimerization domains (Fig.1, A and B). Both proteins have very short N-terminal regions. mCAR2 is identical to mCAR1 except for an out-of-frame 107-bp deletion in the ligand binding/dimerization domain. As a consequence of this deletion, only 6 new amino acids in mCAR2 substitute for the last 78 residues of mCAR1. This C-terminal region of mCAR1 includes both the heterodimerization interface referred to as the 9th heptad (25Forman B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1293-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 33Forman B.M. Yang C.-R. Au M. Casanova J. Ghysdael J. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 3: 1610-1626Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar) or the I box (26Perlmann T. Umesono K. Rangarajan P.N. Forman B.M. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 958-966PubMed Google Scholar), and the AF-2 transactivation domain (34Danielian P.S. White R. Lee J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). hCAR and mCAR belong to a small, rather divergent subgroup within the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily that also includes an orphan receptor from Xenopus laevis (35Smith D.P. Mason C.S. Jones E.A. Old R.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and the mammalian vitamin D receptor. hCAR and mCAR also show relatively strong similarity with the insect ecdysone receptor in the DNA-binding domain, but not other domains (Fig.1 B). Two lines of evidence demonstrate that mCAR2 is not a cloning artifact. The first is simply that this 107-bp segment is missing in more than 5 independently isolated cDNAs. The second is a more direct demonstration of the existence of bands of the expected size using PCR with primers from the E domain and poly(A)+ mRNA from mouse liver as template. As shown in Fig.2, the identity of these bands was confirmed by Southern blotting with probes containing either ligand/dimerization domain sequences present in both, or only sequences from exon 8. This analysis indicates that the mCAR2 variant is a relatively minor fraction of the total mRNA. In addition to these two species, an even lesser amount of an additional species larger than the mCAR1 product was also observed. Its size indicates that it corresponds to a nuclear precursor that includes intron 7, which interrupts the coding region at the start of the mCAR2 deletion (see below). A cDNA clone including only this intron was isolated, but it is unclear whether it represents an additional variant mRNA or a partially spliced nuclear precursor. The similarity between the human hCAR and murine mCAR sequences is significantly less than the 90% or greater identity usually shared by true receptor homologs in different mammalian species. It is comparable to that shared by the various isoforms of the RARs, for example, suggesting that hCAR and mCAR are derived from distinct genes that encode two CAR isoforms. A single clone containing the mCAR gene was obtained from a screen of a mouse genomic library. As diagrammed in Fig.3 A, the murine mCAR gene is interrupted by eight introns. Exon 8 is absent in mCAR2, demonstrating that this variant is generated by alternative mRNA splicing. The 5′ end of the mCAR transcript was mapped by primer extension (Fig.3 B). The sequences of the mCAR cDNAs, gene, and flanking regions have been submitted to GenBank. In Northern blots of poly(A)+ RNA from various mouse tissues hybridized at high stringency with CAR probes, mCAR expression is by far the highest in liver, as described previously for hCAR (24Baes M. Gulick T. Choi H.-S. Martinoli M.G. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In both mouse and human, the most prominent product is a rather broad band of approximately 1.3 to 1.7 kilobases. At least in mouse, this band presumably includes both mCAR1 and mCAR2 transcripts. Additional species of approximately 3.0, 4.0, and 5.7 kilobases are observed in mouse. Larger transcripts of somewhat different sizes are also present in human liver mRNA (24Baes M. Gulick T. Choi H.-S. Martinoli M.G. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). All of these larger mouse transcripts were also identified by much smaller probes containing only 5′-untranslated or ligand/dimerization domain sequences (Fig.4). The hybridization of the 5′ probe indicates that these various species do not correspond to variants with distinct N-terminal sequences, as observed with TRβ1 and TRβ2, for example (36Hodin R.A. Lazar M.A. Wintman B. Darling D.S. Koenig R.J. Larsen P.R. Moore D.D. Chin W.W. Science. 1989; 244: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Similarly, the identical pattern of hybridization with the ligand/dimerization probe indicates that the various transcripts do not include major substitutions of sequences in that region. Finally, a probe from the 3′-flanking region of the gene hybridized only to the three larger species. Thus, these larger species are presumably generated as a consequence of a lack of addition of a poly(A) tract at the position used for the shorter transcripts. These longer, read-through transcripts must include extensive additional 3′-untranslated regions, but it is not known whether the different larger species are generated by additional cases of alternative poly(A) addition, or by alternative mRNA splicing. In much longer exposures of hybridizations with either the full-length probe or the two probes from the 3′ end, an additional transcript of approximately 2.8 kilobases is observed in heart, brain, skeletal muscle, and kidney. This does not correspond to any of the liver transcripts in size, and could be either a transcript of the true murine homolog of hCAR, or another variant product of the mCAR gene. To determine whether the mCAR proteins bind DR-5 response elements as heterodimers with RXR, like hCAR (24Baes M. Gulick T. Choi H.-S. Martinoli M.G. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), mCAR1 and mCAR2 were expressed by in vitro translation. As expected, mCAR1/RXR heterodimers bound with high affinity to the RARE from the RARβ2 isoform promoter (37Sucov H.M. Murakami K.K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5392-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 38de The H. Vivanco-Ruiz M. Tiollais P. Stunnenberg H. Dejean A. Nature. 1990; 343: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). As with hCAR (24Baes M. Gulick T. Choi H.-S. Martinoli M.G. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), the apparent affinity of mCAR1/RXR heterodimers for this βRARE element was indistinguishable from that of RAR/RXR heterodimers. mCAR2 did not bind the βRARE or any other element tested either alone or with RXR. This lack of mCAR2 binding is consistent with the absence of the C-terminal portion of the ligand/dimerization domain, which is essential for heterodimerization (17Leid M. Kastner P. Lyons R.

A. 1991; 88: 8587-8591Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)). Previous results demonstrated that hCAR specifically transactivates the βRARE in the absence of retinoids or any other exogenously added ligands (24Baes M. Gulick T. Choi H.-S. Martinoli M.G. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). To determine whether mCAR1 shows similar effects, it was cotransfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid in which 3 copies of the βRARE were inserted upstream of the TK promoter. In various cell types and under a variety of conditions, hCAR transactivated this reporter approximately 20–100-fold, while mCAR1 was somewhat more effective, conferring a 50–300-fold activation (Fig.6 A). In the presence of all-trans-retinoic acid, RAR was an even more potent transactivator of this reporter (data not shown). As with hCAR, the apparently constitutive transactivation by mCAR1 was observed in the presence of serum treated with charcoal to remove retinoids or other potential ligands, and in several different cell types. As shown in Fig. 6 A, mCAR2 did not transactivate this element, and also did not affect transactivation by hCAR or mCAR1. Similar results were obtained with higher ratios of mCAR2. As expected from these results, mCAR1, but not mCAR2 was able to transactivate a reporter containing the intact RARβ2 promoter, but not a mutant version in which the βRARE element was inactivated by point mutations (Fig.6 B). To confirm that the transactivation observed is a direct effect of mCAR1, mutations were introduced into the mCAR1 AF-2 region. These mutations included both simple deletions and point mutants that were chosen based on comparisons of this region of mCAR to the analogous region in other receptors. As indicated in Fig.7 A, the Δ8 mutation and the point mutants L353A and E355A specifically affect the AF-2 motif. The larger Δ27 mutation extends into the region homologous to helix 10 of RXR (41Bourget W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar), and the analogous helices in the TR (42Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. McGrath M.E. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar) and RAR (43Renaud J.P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar) structures, but stops short of the 9th heptad motif (25Forman B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1293-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) within this helix. All of these mutations completely abrogated transactivation by mCAR1 (Fig. 7 B). A Western blot with an antibody directed against an epitope tag present at the N terminus of the wild type and mutant proteins confirmed that all were expressed at similar levels (data not shown). As demonstrated in Fig. 7 C, all the mutants except Δ27 were able to bind DNA. Although this mutant retains the 9th heptad motif, it is missing most of the helix that contains this motif. At least in the case of RXR homodimers, the C terminus of this helix is involved in an important dimer contact (41Bourget W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Many of the genes that encode the members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily express more than one protein product as a consequence of either alternative promoter utilization or alternative mRNA processing. The independent isolation of a number of cDNA clones corresponding to the deleted mCAR2 product initially suggested that the mCAR gene belongs to this group, and the existence of distinct mCAR isoforms was confirmed by a PCR based approach. The mCAR gene also expresses additional transcripts with larger 3′-untranslated sequences as a consequence of a lack of poly(A) addition at the primary site. However, these larger transcripts do not encode variant mCAR proteins. The mCAR1 and hCAR sequences contain a good match to the AF-2 transcriptional activation domain at their extreme C termini. This conserved motif is present in many conventional receptors and orphans (34Danielian P.S. White R. Lee J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), and has been directly associated with ligand dependent transcriptional activation in several conventional receptors (e.g. Refs. 44Barettino D. Vivanco-Ruiz M.M. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 45Tone Y. Collingwood T.N. Adams M. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 110-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Mutation of this conserved motif in mCAR also blocks transactivation. This demonstrates that the CAR component of the CAR/RXR heterodimer is actively involved in transactivation. It also confirms a prediction, derived from both sequence conservation and recent results with HNF-4 (48Malik S. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1824-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), that the conserved AF-2 motif is involved not only in ligand dependent transactivation, but also in the apparently ligand independent transactivation observed with several other orphans. The mCAR2 variant is missing an additional conserved motif near the C terminus of the ligand binding/dimerization domain, which has been called the 9th heptad (25Forman B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1987; 3: 1610-1626Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar) or the I-box (26Perlmann T. Umesono K. Rangarajan P.N. Forman B.M. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 958-966PubMed Google Scholar). A number of studies with diverse receptors have shown that this region is required for heterodimerization with RXR (e.g. Ref. 27Au-Fliegner M. Helmer E. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5725-5737Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Since heterodimerization is required for high affinity DNA binding, it is not surprising that the mCAR2 variant does not bind the βRARE or other elements. Particularly since mCAR2 is also missing the conserved AF-2 transactivation motif, it should not compete for coactivator binding, and should not inhibit transactivation by mCAR1, a prediction borne out in appropriate transfections. This leaves the function of the mCAR2 variant undefined, although it is possible that it could compete with the mCAR1 form for interaction with other, as yet undefined proteins. Previous results have demonstrated a positive feedback loop in which the RARβ2 transcript is strongly induced by retinoids (37Sucov H.M. Murakami K.K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5392-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 38de The H. Vivanco-Ruiz M. Tiollais P. Stunnenberg H. Dejean A. Nature. 1990; 343: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Although the levels of the RARβ2 transcript are very low in the absence of retinoids in some cultured cell lines, this transcript is present at significant levels in the livers of vitamin A-deficient animals (49Haq R.-H. Pfahl M. Chytil F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8272-8276Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The combination of the expression of mCAR1 in the liver and its ability to transactivate the RARβ2 promoter in the absence of any added retinoids clearly suggests a direct role for this orphan in maintaining basal levels of RARβ2. From a broader perspective, it seems likely that mCAR1 also acts to maintain expression of other retinoid-responsive genes in the absence of retinoids. As previously discussed for hCAR (24Baes M. Gulick T. Choi H.-S. Martinoli M.G. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), mCAR1 could have more complex effects in the presence of retinoids. Since it is a less potent transactivator than RAR, it could act to decrease overall expression by competing for occupancy if both proteins were present at high levels. If both CAR and RAR were present at subsaturating levels, however, additional occupancy of RAREs by CAR might augment RAR action. The apparent ability of endogenous RARs to fully occupy specific RAREs under at least some in vivo conditions (50Dey A. Minucci S. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8191-8201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that competition for binding could be an important aspect of CAR function. In contrast, the observation that supraphysiologic expression of a receptor usually substantially augments response (e.g. Refs.51Brent G.A. Larsen P.R. Harney J.W. Koenig R.J. Moore D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 178-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 52Webb P. Lopez G.N. Greene G.L. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) is consistent with the possibility that CAR cooperates with the RARs. The relative roles of CAR and RAR on a particular element are clearly dependent not only on their relative levels of expression, but also on their relative DNA binding affinities. mCAR1/RXR heterodimers, like hCAR/RXR heterodimers (24Baes M. Gulick T. Choi H.-S. Martinoli M.G. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), bind the βRARE with an affinity indistinguishable from that of RAR/RXR heterodimers, and CAR/RXR complexes can also bind with high affinity to other DR-5 and DR-2 RAREs. 2D. Simha, T. Gulick, and D. D. Moore, manuscript in preparation. Unexpectedly, however, recent results demonstrate that the affinity of CAR/RXR heterodimers, but not RAR/RXR heterodimers, for DR-5 sites is strikingly dependent on the sequence of the 5-bp spacer.2. This suggests that CAR targets only a subset of retinoid-responsive genes, and provides yet another example of the complexity of the overlapping network of regulatory effects of the nuclear hormone receptors.

Mature Paneth cells secrete antimicrobial peptides (cryptdins), growth factors, as well as two gene products, a secreted phospholipase A2 and matrilysin, that has been implicated as modifiers of adenoma formation in mice containing a mutation in the tumor suppressor Apc. Immature Paneth cells are located just above and below the cell layer, in intestinal crypts, that has been proposed to contain the multipotent stem cell. Paneth cells differentiate during a downward migration to the crypt base. The location and direction of Paneth cell migration, their high density and long residency time at the crypt base, and the nature of their secreted gene products, suggest that they may influence the structure and/or function of the stem cell niche. Paneth cell ablation can therefore be viewed as an experimental manipulation of the cellular microenvironment that purportedly contains the stem cell and its immediate descendants. Two types of ablation experiments were performed in transgenic mice. Nucleotides −6500 to +34 of the mouse cryptdin-2 gene (CR2) were used to express an attenuated diphtheria toxin A fragment. Light and electron microscopic immunohistochemical analyses of several pedigrees of postnatal day 28 to 180 animals established that ablation of Paneth cells is accompanied by an increase in the proportion of undifferentiated crypt base columnar cells. These cells normally co-exist with Paneth cells. The ablation does not produce a detectable effect on the proliferation or terminal differentiation programs of the other three lineages or on host-microbial interactions. The last conclusion is based on the ability of crypts to remain free of microbes detectable by Gram and Warthin-Starry stains and by retention of the normal crypt-villus distribution of components of the diffuse gut-associated lymphoid tissue. CR2-directed expression of simian virus 40 large T antigen also results in a loss of mature Paneth cells but produces a marked amplification of crypt cells having a morphology intermediate between Paneth and granule goblet cells. EM immunohistochemical analyses suggest that intermediate cells can differentiate to mature goblet cells but not to Paneth cells, as they migrate up the crypt-villus axis. Our findings suggest that (i) stemness in the crypt is not defined by instructive interactions involving the Paneth cell; (ii) expressing a Paneth cell fate may require that precursors migrate to the crypt base; (iii) antimicrobial factors produced by Paneth cells are not required to prevent colonization of small intestinal crypts; and (iv) this lineage does not function to maintain the asymmetric crypt-villus distribution of components of the diffuse gut-associated lymphoid tissue.

The structural and functional organization of the adult mouse small intestinal epithelium lends itself to studying both the regulation and integration of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and death programs. The epithelium contains four principal cell types: absorptive enterocytes (comprising >80% of the total population), enteroendocrine cells, mucus-producing goblet cells, and Paneth cells. All four lineages are derived from a multipotent stem cell that is functionally anchored near the base of each of the small intestine's 1.1 million crypts of Lieberkühn (1Cheng H. Leblond C.P. Am. J. Anat. 1974; 141: 537-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar, 2Bjerknes M. Cheng H. Am. J. Anat. 1981; 160: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 3Bjerknes M. Cheng H. Am. J.

Cell division is confined to these crypts (5Potten C.S. Loeffler M. Development. 1990; 110: 1001-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enterocytes, enteroendocrine, and goblet cells migrate out of the crypt and up an adjacent villus. Migration is highly ordered and associated with terminal differentiation. Cell death occurs near the villus tip where cells are exfoliated into the lumen (6Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9167) Google Scholar, 7Hall P.A. Coates P.J. Ansari B. Hopwood D. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3569-3577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proliferation, differentiation, and death take place in a spatially well-organized continuum that extends from the crypt to the apex of a villus. This sequence is completed rapidly (2–5 days in the case of enterocytes, enteroendocrine, and goblet cells; Refs. 1Cheng H. Leblond C.P. Am. J. Anat. 1974; 141: 537-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar and8Cheng H. Am. J. Anat. 1974; 141: 481-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 9Cheng H. Leblond C.P. Am. J.

Anat. 1974; 141: 503-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and is recapitulated throughout the lifespan of the mouse. The Paneth cell lineage differs from the others in a number of notable ways. It is the only lineage that executes its terminal differentiation program during a downward migration from the stem cell zone to the crypt base (11Cheng H. Am. J. Anat. 1974; 141: 521-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It is the longest lived lineage, and the only one that exists entirely within the proliferative compartment. Each crypt contains 30–50 mature Paneth cells that survive for 18–23 days before degenerating and undergoing phagocytosis by their neighbors (11Cheng H. Am. J. Anat. 1974; 141: 521-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 12Cheng H. Merzel J. Leblond C.P. Am. J. Anat. 1969; 126: 507-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 13Troughton W.D. Trier J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 41: 251-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Paneth cell age correlates with position in the crypt; the most mature cells are located at or near the crypt base (2Bjerknes M. Cheng H. Am. J. Anat. 1981; 160: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The size of the Paneth cell's apical secretory granules also correlates with age; larger granules are produced by older cells (2Bjerknes M. Cheng H. Am. J. Anat. 1981; 160: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 11Cheng H. Am. J. Anat. 1974; 141: 521-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The function of the Paneth cell has not yet been clearly defined. Residency at the crypt base places this lineage in a position to release products from its apical granules that could affect establishment and/or maintenance of the stem cell's niche or influence the properties of the stem cell's descendants. A number of factors exported by Paneth cells could regulate epithelial proliferation and differentiation programs. They include tumor necrosis factor-α (14Tan X. Hsueh W. Gonzalez-Crussi F. Am. J. Path. 1993; 142: 1858-1865PubMed Google Scholar), guanylin (15de Sauvage F.J. Keshav S. Kuang W.J. Gillett N. Henzel W. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9089-9093Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and epidermal growth factor (16Poulsen S.S. Nexo E. Olsen P.S. Hess J. Kirkegaard P. Histochemistry. 1986; 85: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Two Paneth cell products have been implicated as modifiers of adenoma formation in mice heterozygous for a mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene,Apc Min (17Su L.-K. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Preisinger A.C. Moser A.R. Luongo C. Gould K.A. Dove W.F. Science. 1992; 256: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). Production of matrilysin, a matrix metalloproteinase, is limited to the Paneth cell lineage in the adult mouse intestine (18Wilson C.L. Heppner K.J. Rudolph L.A. Matrisian L.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 851-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The protein is expressed in a high percentage of early stage human colorectal neoplasms and Min adenomas (19Wilson C.L. Heppner K.J. Labosky P.A. Hogan B.L.M. Matrisian L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Min/+ mice homozygous for a null allele of the matrilysin gene have 60% fewer adenomas than animals with the wild type allele, suggesting that the enzyme functions as suppressor of tumorigenesis (19Wilson C.L. Heppner K.J. Labosky P.A. Hogan B.L.M. Matrisian L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Pla2 g2a encodes a phospholipase A2 that is secreted from Paneth cells (20Mulherkar R. Desai S.J. Rao R.S. Wagle A.S. Deo M.G. Histochemistry. 1991; 96: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Mulherkar R. Rao R.S. Wagle A.S. Patki V. Deo M.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

J. 1971; 3: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27Peeters T. VanTrappen G. Gut. 1975; 16: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and a family of defensin-related anti-microbial peptides known as cryptdins (28Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1280-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The intestine contains a complex microflora. Components of this microflora are able to establish stable niches at particular positions along the duodenal-ileal axis (29Savage D.C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1977; 31: 107-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). The fact that different cryptdins exhibit distinct developmental and spatial patterns of expression along this axis (30Darmoul D. Ouellette A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G68-G74PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that Paneth cells could play a role in modulating the composition of the microbiota or contribute to mucosal barrier functions. We have examined the contribution of this lineage to epithelial and microbial homeostasis by generating two types of transgenic mice in which mature Paneth cells have been eliminated. A 2.7-kb 1The abbreviations used are: kb, kilobase pairs; SV40 TAg, simian virus 40 large T antigen; CR2, nucleotides −6500 to +34 of the mouse cryptdin-2 gene; DT-A, diphtheria toxin A fragment; tox176, an attenuated DT-A containing a Gly128 → Asp substitution; hGH, human growth hormone; P, postnatal day; BrdU, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; PAS, periodic acid-Schiff stain; EPX, endogenous peroxidases; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; Cy3, indocarbocyanine; Cy5, indodicarbocyanine; SFB, segmented filamentous bacterium; GALT, gut-associated lymphoid system; TCR, T-cell receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DBA,Dolichos biflorus agglutinin; UEA-1, Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1. DNA fragment containing simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40 TAg) was excised from pIF-TAg-hGH (31Hauft S.M. Kim S.H. Schmidt G.H. Pease S. Rees S. Harris S. Roth K.A. Hansbrough J.R. Cohn S.M. Ahnen D.J. Wright N.A. Goodlad R.A. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 825-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) with BamHI and subcloned into theBamHI site of pCR-H1 (32Bry L. Falk P. Huttner K. Ouellette A. Midtvedt T. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10335-10339Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This yielded pCR2-TAg which contained SV40 TAg under the control of nucleotides −6500 to +34 of the mouse cryptdin-2 gene (33Huttner K.M. Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J. Genomics. 1994; 19: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Complete digestion of pIF-TAg-hGH with BamHI, followed by partial digestion with EcoRI, allowed purification of a DNA fragment containing pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene) with nucleotides +3 to +2150 of the human growth hormone gene (hGH; Ref.34Seeburg P.H. DNA ( N. Y. ). 1982; 1: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This fragment and a BamHI/EcoRI fragment containing cryptdin-2−6500 to +34 and SV40 TAg from pCR2-TAg were ligated together, producing pCR2-TAg-hGH. pCR2-TAg-hGH was subsequently cut with BamHI, treated with Klenow, and ligated to a 0.6-kb HincII fragment containing an attenuated diphtheria toxin A fragment (tox176; Ref. 35Maxwell F. Maxwell I.H. Glode L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1576-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pCR2-tox176-hGH, contained tox176 immediately downstream of cryptdin-2−6500 to +34 and immediately upstream of hGH+3 to +2150. tox176 was placed in exon1 of hGH to enhance the chances of efficiently expressing the toxin. hGH will not be produced from the RNA transcript of cryptdin-2−6500 to +34-tox176-hGH+3 to +2150: the initiator Met and the first stop codon are from the open reading frame of tox176, and there is no ribosomal re-entry site to re-initiate translation at the downstream initiator ATG of hGH. A 9.2-kb fragment containing cryptdin-2−6500 to +34 and SV40 TAg (CR2-TAg) was released from pCR2-TAg by digestion with NotI andEcoRI. pCR2-tox176-hGH was digested with NotI andXhoI to liberate a 9.4-kb DNA fragment containing cryptdin-2−6500 to +34-tox176-hGH (CR2-tox176). An 8.3-kb fragment containing cryptdin-2−6500 to +34 linked to hGH+3 to +2150 (CR2-hGH) was released from pCR-H1 withEcoRI (32Bry L. Falk P. Huttner K. Ouellette A. Midtvedt T. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10335-10339Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Each fragment was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by glass bead extraction (Geneclean, Bio 101) and used for pronuclear injection of FVB/N oocytes. Oocytes were subsequently transferred to pseudopregnant Swiss Webster females using standard techniques (36Hogan, B., Constantini, F., and Lacy, E. (eds) (1986) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbour, NY.Google Scholar). Live born mice were screened for the presence of transgenes by extracting tail DNA and performing polymerase chain reactions using primers that anneal to hGH DNA (CR2-tox176; CR2-hGH; 5′-AGGTGGCCTTTGACACCTACCAGG-3′ and 5′-TCTGTTGTGTTTCCTCCCTGTTGG-3′) or to SV40 TAg DNA (CR2-TAg; 5′-ATGAATGGGAGCAGTGGTG-3′ and 5′-GCAGACACTCTATGCCTGTGTGG-3′). The polymerase chain reaction mixtures (final volume = 25 μl) contained 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, primers (1 μm each), 0.7 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim), and approximately 0.5 μg of genomic DNA. The following cycling conditions were used to amplify an hGH fragment from CR2-tox176 and CR2-hGH DNAs: denaturation, 1 min at 94 °C; annealing, 1.5 min at 55 °C; and extension, 2 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles. For CR2-TAg, denaturation was performed at 95 °C and annealing at 58 °C. Four CR2-hGH founders were identified from 38 live born mice, 2 CR2-tox176 founders from 67 mice, and 10 CR2-TAg founders from 87 animals. Pedigrees were established from each of the CR2-hGH and CR2-tox176 founders and from 8 of the CR-TAg founders. All pedigrees were maintained by crosses to normal FVB/N littermates. Pedigree 61, containing CR2-hGH, has been described in an earlier publication (32Bry L. Falk P. Huttner K. Ouellette A. Midtvedt T. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10335-10339Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Mice were housed in microisolator cages under a strictly controlled light cycle (lights on at 0600 h and off at 1800 h) and given a standard irradiated chow dietad libitum (Pico rodent chow 20, Purina Mills). Routine screens for hepatitis, minute, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, ectromelia, polyoma, sendai, pneumonia, and MAD viruses, enteric bacterial pathogens, and parasites were negative. Specific pathogen-free transgenic animals and their nontransgenic littermates were sacrificed between postnatal days 28 (P28) and P180. Immediately after sacrifice, the small intestine was removed en bloc, flushed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 10% buffered formalin (Fisher) for 4–6 h, and then washed in 70% ethanol overnight at room temperature. The intestine was embedded in plastic (JB-4 Embedding Kit, Polysciences), and 1–2-μm thick sections (“thin sections”) cut from its proximal, middle, and distal thirds (these segments were arbitrarily designated duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, respectively). Alternatively, after washing in 70% ethanol, the intestine was cut open along its duodenal-ileal axis, rolled into a circle, and held in this circular configuration by mounting agar (2% agar (Sigma) in 5% buffered formalin). Each of the resulting “Swiss rolls” was then placed in a tissue cassette, embedded in paraffin, and 5 μm-thick serial sections were prepared. Plastic- or paraffin-embedded sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, phloxine/tartrazine, or with Alcian blue and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) using standard protocols (37). Goblet cells were quantitated by counting Alcian blue/PAS-positive cells in all well-oriented jejunal crypt-villus units present in at least two non-adjacent sections cut from Swiss rolls (sections were prepared from three P28 transgenic animals and three normal littermates per pedigree). Paneth cells were likewise quantitated by counting phloxine/tartrazine-positive cells in jejunal crypts. To analyze the distribution of components of the microflora along the crypt-villus units of specific pathogen-free transgenic animals and their normal littermates, mice from the various pedigrees were sacrificed at P28, P42, and P120–P180. Their small intestines were fixed 4–6 h in 10% buffered formalin without prior flushing and then cut into 1–2-cm segments. Each segment was embedded in paraffin, 4–6-μm thick sections were cut, and the sections treated with Warthin-Starry or Gram stains (37). Transgenic mice and their normal littermates were sacrificed at P28, P42, and P120–180 (n = 3–5/group/pedigree/time point). Some animals received an intraperitoneal injection of an aqueous solution of 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (120 mg/kg, BrdU) and 5′-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (12 mg/kg) 1.5 to 72 h before sacrifice. The small intestine was then removed from each animal, flushed with cold PBS, fixed in Bouin's solution for 8 h at room temperature, treated with 70% ethanol, and 4–6-μm thick sections cut from paraffin-embedded Swiss rolls. Sections were then deparaffinized, rehydrated, and placed in PBS-blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 20 min at room temperature.

Antigen-antibody complexes were detected with indocarbocyanine (Cy3)- or indodicarbocyanine (Cy5)-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or anti-goat immunoglobulins (Ig; Jackson Immunoresearch; 1:500).

The spatial distribution of components of the diffuse gut-associated lymphoid system (GALT) was examined in P42 CR2-tox176 mice and their normal littermates (n = 3 animals/group/pedigree) using the following panel of monoclonal antibodies from PharMingen (each diluted 1:1000 in PBS-blocking buffer): (i) rat anti-mouse CD4 (clone H129.19); (ii) rat anti-mouse α chain of CD8 (clone 53–6.7); (iii) hamster anti-mouse β-subunit of the αβ T-cell receptor (TCR; clone H57–597); (iv) hamster anti-mouse γδ TCR (clone GL3); and (v) rat anti-mouse CD45R/B220 (a B-cell marker; clone RA3–6B2). Mice were sacrificed, and the middle third of the small bowel was flushed with PBS and then frozen in OCT (Miles). Serial sections were cut, fixed in methanol (−20 °C for 15 min), washed 3 times (3 min/cycle) in PBS, and treated with PBS-blocking buffer (15 min at room temperature). A variety of methods that are traditionally used for eliminating endogenous peroxidase (EPX) activities from cryostat sections of the intestine either failed to adequately remove EPX or to preserve the antigens that we were studying (cf. Ref. 43Hunyady B. Mezey É. Pacak K. Palkovits M. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 106: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, we found that endogenous biotin levels were below the limits of detection with tyramide signal amplification protocols that employed horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin. Therefore, cells with EPX activity were labeled by incubating frozen sections of intestine for 8–10 min at room temperature with FITC-conjugated tyramide (obtained from NEN Life Science Products and diluted 1:100 in 1 × amplification diluent from the same manufacturer). Following 3 washes in PBS (5 min each), the sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with one of the primary antibodies and then washed in TNT buffer (0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20; 3 cycles with 5 min/wash). Two secondary antibodies were used to visualize antigen-antibody complexes. (i) If HRP-conjugated goat anti-rat Ig (Kirkegaard and Perry Labs) was used, it was first diluted 1:100 in TNB buffer (TNB = 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15m NaCl, 0.5% blocking reagent from NEN Life Science Products) and then placed on the section for 30 min (this and all subsequent steps were performed at room temperature). After three washes with TNT buffer, biotinyl-tyramide was added (diluted 1:100 in 1 × amplification diluent). Following a 8–10-min incubation, the sections were washed several times in TNT buffer and overlaid with Cy3-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson Immunoresearch; diluted 1:500 in TNB) for 30 min. (ii) If a biotinylated anti-hamster Ig (diluted 1:100 in TNB) was used as the secondary antibody, it was detected with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (NEN Life Science Products; diluted 1:1000 in TNB) followed by amplification with biotinyl-tyramide and application of Cy3-streptavidin, as described above. Two controls were performed for each experiment employing a given primary antiserum: (i) direct amplification of EPX alone (see above) and (ii) omission of primary antibodies. The latter control involved direct amplification of EPX followed by application of an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and subsequent indirect tyramide signal amplification with biotinyl tyramide and Cy3-streptavidin. Alternatively, when biotinylated secondary antibodies were employed, there would be a control to establish whether there was any labeling of endogenous biotin. This control consisted of direct tyramide amplification of EPX with FITC-tyramide followed by HRP-streptavidin but without addition of the biotinylated secondary antibodies or the primary antibodies. (Note that adding Cy3-streptavidin alone to jejunal sections did not produce any cellular staining.) A Molecular Dynamics Multiprobe 2001 inverted confocal microscope system was used to scan sections subjected to single and/or multi-label immunohistochemistry. Sections were also viewed and photographed using a Zeiss Axioscope. Apoptotic cells were scored in adjacent sections of Swiss rolls, prepared from normal, CR2-tox176, and CR2-TAg mice, using the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated, dUTP nick end-labeling assay, and by their morphologic appearance after staining with hematoxylin and eosin (6Gavrieli Y.

Multiple ubiquitins can be ligated together through the formation of isopeptide bonds between Lys48 and Gly76 of successive ubiquitins. Such a polyubiquitin chain constitutes a highly effective proteolytic targeting signal, but its mode of interaction with the proteasome is not well understood. Experiments to address this issue have been limited by difficulties in preparing useful quantities of polyubiquitin chains of uniform length. We report a simple method for large scale synthesis of Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains of defined length. In the first round of synthesis, two ubiquitin derivatives (K48C-ubiquitin and Asp77-ubiquitin) were used as substrates for the well characterized ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-25K. Diubiquitin blocked at the nascent proximal and distal chain termini was obtained in quantitative yield. Appropriately deblocked chains were then combined to synthesize higher order chains (tetramer and octamer in the present study). Deblocking was achieved either enzymatically (proximal terminus) or by chemical alkylation (distal terminus). Chains synthesized by this method were used to obtain the first quantitative information concerning the influence of polyubiquitin chain length on binding to the 26 S proteasome; this was done through comparison of different length (unanchored) polyubiquitin chains as inhibitors of ubiquitin-conjugate degradation.K 0.5 was found to decrease ∼90-fold, from 430 to 4.8 μm, as the chain was lengthened from two to eight ubiquitins.

The implications of these results for the molecular basis of chain recognition are discussed. The conserved protein ubiquitin functions in diverse biological processes, including oncogenesis, cell cycle progression, antigen presentation, and programmed cell death (for review, see Refs. 1Ciechanover A.

These and most other functions of ubiquitin reflect its role as an essential cofactor in an energy-dependent proteolytic pathway whose hallmarks are an unusual combination of high volume and high selectivity: most short lived proteins are degraded in this pathway, but the half-lives of individual substrate proteins can be regulated acutely and independently. Ubiquitin acts as a degradation signal by virtue of covalent ligation to target proteins. Ubiquitination occurs through the formation of an isopeptide bond between the COOH terminus of ubiquitin (Gly76) and an internal Lys residue of the target protein. This modification confers recognition by the multisubunit 26 S proteasome; the target protein is degraded, but ubiquitin is regenerated for use in subsequent proteolytic cycles (1Ciechanover A.

Recent studies suggest that for a given substrate, a specific E3 carries out the substrate ubiquitination step, whereas a specific E2 charges the E3 with ubiquitin (5Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). The ligation of multiple ubiquitins increases the rate of substrate degradation (6Hershko A. Leshinsky E.

Multiple ubiquitination can occur through the ligation of ubiquitin monomers to several substrate Lys residues (9Hershko A. Heller H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) but more typically involves the assembly on the substrate of a polymeric, isopeptide-linked ubiquitin chain (10Chau V.

Multiple Lys residues of ubiquitin, including Lys6, Lys11, Lys29, Lys48, and Lys63, can serve as sites of polyubiquitin chain initiation and/or elongation (10Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A.

However, Lys48-linked chains represent the most commonly utilized degradation signal in the ubiquitin pathway. This conclusion is supported by several lines of evidence, including the results ofin vitro biochemical analyses (10Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A.

The targeting ability of Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains apparently arises from their high affinity for the 26 S proteasome, which may be due in part to the exposure of a regular array of hydrophobic patches on the chain surface (17Beal R. Deveraux Q. Xia G. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome is assembled from catalytic (20 S) and regulatory (19 S) subcomplexes (3Rubin D.M. Finley D. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 854-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 18Hoffman L. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol.

The crystal structures of 20 S proteasomes from archaebacteria and yeast show that access to the proteolytic active sites is highly restricted (21Lowe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 22Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar). Thus the target protein must be unfolded before degradation. Targeting of the ubiquitinated substrate to the proteasome is an activity of the 19 S complex, as suggested by the ubiquitin independence of protein degradation catalyzed by the 20 S proteasome (3Rubin D.M. Finley D. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 854-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 18Hoffman L. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol.

The 19 S complex contains a polyubiquitin chain-binding protein known as S5a, MBP1, or MCB1 (23Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Van Nocker S. Deveraux Q. Rechsteiner M. Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20878-20884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, most of the subunits of the 19 S complex are functionally uncharacterized. One or more of these subunits must be an additional polyubiquitin-binding protein because a yeastmcb1Δ strain is viable and competent in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (26Van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Fu H. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Biochemically useful quantities of substrates, i.e. polyubiquitinated target proteins, are a prerequisite for dissecting the mechanistic coordination of chain recognition, substrate unfolding, and peptide bond hydrolysis by the 26 S proteasome. Ideally these substrates should be homogeneous by several different criteria: overall purity, polyubiquitin chain length, chain linkage, and site of chain ligation to the target protein. So far, such well defined substrates have been unattainable because of the low purity and abundance of E3 enzymes, as well as the uncontrolled character of chain elongation as catalyzed by available E2 and E3 enzymes. To overcome the chain elongation problem, we have implemented a novel method that utilizes the well characterized ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-25K to generate Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains of defined length. This method avoids uncontrolled polymerization by utilizing, in each round of synthesis, two chain reactants, one reversibly capped at its proximal, and the other at its distal, terminus. This method generates “unanchored” chains that bind to the 26 S proteasome and inhibit the degradation of polyubiquitinated lysozyme. This inhibition assay was used to evaluate, for the first time, the relative binding of different length chains to the 26 S proteasome. Ethyleneimine was purchased from ChemService, stored at 5 °C, and used within several days of opening the sealed ampule. Except where noted, other reagents were purchased from Sigma.

Yeast ubiquitin hydrolase-1 was prepared by a slight modification of the method described previously (31Miller H.I. Henzel W.J. Ridgway J.B. Kuang W.-J. Chisholm V. Liu C.-C.

Plasmids encoding K48C- and K48R-ubiquitin were prepared by mutagenesis of pPLhUb (35Burch T.J. Haas A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7300-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) as described (17Beal R. Deveraux Q. Xia G. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The coding regions of the resulting pPLhUb plasmids were amplified using flanking primers Ub5F (5′-tgcatttatttgcatacattca-3′) and Ub3F (5′-cgaattcgagctcggatcctcaa-3′). The resulting products were digested with NdeI and BamHI and subcloned intoNdeI/BamHI-restricted pET3a to produce pET3a-UbK48C and pET3a-UbK48R. The plasmid pRSUbD, encoding Asp77-ubiquitin, was prepared as follows. A vector library encoding a variety of single amino acids COOH-terminal to ubiquitin was constructed by polymerase chain reaction. To create this amino acid library at position 77, the coding region of pRSUb 2C. Larsen and K.

The primer sequences were 5′-atccatatgcagatcttcg-3′ and 5′-caagcttctaNNNaccaccacgaagtc-3′. The polymerase chain reaction products from this reaction were subcloned en masse into pCRII (Invitrogen). Plasmids containing inserts were sequenced, and an insert encoding Asp at the COOH terminus was subcloned into pRSET using the NdeI and HindIII sites. A plasmid for IPTG-induced expression of H6,K48C-ubiquitin was prepared by ligating the KpnI-BglII fragment (34Ecker D.J. Butt T.R. Marsh J. Sternberg E.J. Margolis N. Monia B.P. Jonnalagadda S.

Chem. 1987; 262: 14213-14221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from pPLhUb-K48C into pDS78 from which this same fragment had been excised. Plasmid pDS78, provided by M. Rechsteiner (University of Utah) encodes an H6-tagged version of human ubiquitin under the control of an IPTG-inducible promoter. The BglII site in pDS78 occurs just after the H6 tag; the NH2-terminal sequence is MHHHHHHGEFQ, where Q corresponds to Q2 in wild type human ubiquitin. Expression of K48C-, K48R-, and Asp77-ubiquitins (encoded by pET/pRSET-based plasmids) was induced by the addition of 0.4 mm IPTG to cultures of appropriately transformed E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells growing at 37 °C. IPTG was added once anA 600 of ∼0.6 had been reached, and growth was continued for 4 h more. Cells were harvested, frozen, and thawed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (24% base) and 0.4 mg/ml lysozyme, supplemented with 1 mm EDTA and 10 mm DTT in the case of K48C-ubiquitin (2 ml of buffer/g of cells). Efficient lysis occurred over several minutes. DNase I (20 μg/ml) and MgCl2 (10 mm) were then added to digest DNA. Expression of H6-tagged ubiquitins in strain M15 (harboring the lac repressor-expressing plasmid pDMI,1) was carried out similarly, except that cells were lysed using a French press. In all cases, crude soluble lysates were produced by centrifugation at 9,000 × g for 20 min. Non-ubiquitin proteins were precipitated at 0 °C with perchloric acid (3.5% w/v). Ubiquitin was resolved from the dialyzed supernatant by cation exchange chromatography on S-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as described (36Haas A.L. Wilkinson K.D. Prep. Biochem. 1985; 15: 49-60PubMed Google Scholar) (K48C- and Asp77-ubiquitins) or by gradient elution from S-Sepharose at pH 6.1 (H6-tagged ubiquitins). For K48C mutants, all steps were carried out in the presence of 1 mmDTT and 0.1 mm EDTA. The ubiquitin derivatives utilized in this work were recovered at 25–100 mg of purified protein/liter of cell culture. Ubiquitin concentrations were determined byA 280, assuming an absorbance of 0.16 for a 1 mg/ml solution (36Haas A.L. Wilkinson K.D. Prep. Biochem. 1985; 15: 49-60PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetics were monitored at 37 °C in incubations containing 0.2 m Tris-HCl (50% base), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm cysteine, or 0.5 mm K48C-ubiquitin, and 0–64 mm alkylating reagent; or Tris (pH 8.0), was replaced by Bis-Tris propane (pH 8.5). At timed intervals, aliquots were assayed for remaining thiol with dithionitrobenzoate (37Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21618) Google Scholar). Values of k obs were obtained from linear plots of lnAt /A 0 against time and were corrected by subtracting the value ofk obs measured in the absence of alkylating agent. For the experiments shown in Table I and Fig. 3, conditions were as follows. Reactions with ethyleneimine contained 50 mm ethyleneimine and the purified ubiquitin chain at 2–20 mg/ml (≤1 ml). Other conditions were the same as for kinetic measurements (above). After 1 h, the reaction mixture was dialyzed against 5 mmammonium acetate (pH 5.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT to remove residual ethyleneimine. Alkylation of K48C-ubiquitin (1 mg/ml) with bromoethylamine (50 mm, Aldrich) was carried out similarly. For alkylation of K48C-ubiquitin (1 mg/ml) with N-(iodoethyl)trifluoroacetamide (Aminoethyl-8TM, Pierce), 3.4-h incubations were done at 50 °C in 0.2 m Bis-Tris propane (as above). The alkylating agent was dissolved in methanol and added in two equal portions at time zero and 1 h to give a final concentration of 3.1 mm. After addition of DTT to 0.25 mm, the reaction was dialyzed as above.Table ISupport of degradation by mutant ubiquitins and alkylated derivativesUbiquitinSteady-state degradation rate125I-Lactalbumin125I-Lysozyme% wild type ubiquitinK48C-ubiquitin37.8 ± 2.059.4 ± 3.7K48R-ubiquitin9.3 ± 1.735.7 ± 8.2K48C (ethyleneimine)65.6 ± 3.895.5 ± 5.2K48C (bromoethylamine)70.5 ± 4.397.4 ± 5.3K48C (Aminoethyl-8)62.9 ± 2.791.6 ± 5.1Disassembled Ub468.8Not doneAssays of the production of acid-soluble radioactivity were carried out in fraction II; ubiquitin and derivatives were added at 12 μm (20 × K 0.5 for wild type).

The purified ubiquitin chain (2–50 mg/ml, ≤1 ml) was incubated with 15 μg/ml yeast ubiquitin hydrolase-1 for 1 h at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (24% base), 0.1 mm EDTA, and ∼0.5 mm DTT. The reaction was passed through a 0.5-ml Q-Sepharose column (Pharmacia; preequilibrated in the same buffer) to absorb the enzyme; the flow-through was collected into a Centricon-10 microconcentrator (Amicon). The column was washed with 3 volumes of buffer. The combined flow-through and wash fractions were concentrated. The production of acid-soluble radioactivity from 125I-lysozyme or125I-lactalbumin (∼106 cpm/μg; ∼105 cpm/25-μl incubation) was monitored in incubations with rabbit reticulocyte fraction II (∼1.5 mg/ml protein) as described (17Beal R. Deveraux Q. Xia G. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Rates obtained in the presence of wild type ubiquitin or ubiquitin derivative (12 μm) were corrected using blanks obtained by omitting ubiquitin. In some cases aliquots were withdrawn during the steady state of degradation for analysis of the levels of ubiquitin-substrate conjugates after electrophoresis and autoradiography (17Beal R. Deveraux Q. Xia G. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). For the experiment involving disassembly of engineered Ub4 (see the last entry in Table I), 4.5 μm Ub4 (potentially yielding 18 μm monoubiquitin) was preincubated for 30 min under the conditions of the degradation assay, except that ATP, regenerating system, and labeled substrate were omitted. These components were added to initiate the assay. For the control, the preincubation contained 18 μm wild type monoubiquitin. Incubations of 0.2–2.0 ml contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (50% base), 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 0.6 unit/ml each of creatine phosphokinase and inorganic pyrophosphatase, 4 mm ATP, and 0.5–1 mm DTT (37 °C); E1 and C170S,F174L-E2-25K were 0.2 μm and 20 μm, respectively. The two chain reactants were added at equal concentrations. Times required for completion of the conjugation reaction, usually 1–4 h, were determined by examining reaction aliquots by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. At the end of the incubation, the reaction was passed through a Q-Sepharose column (0.5–1 ml) at pH 7.6 to absorb the enzymes. In most cases the unabsorbed fraction was adjusted to pH 4.5 (for non-tagged chains) or 6.1 (for H6-tagged chains) and applied to an S-Sepharose column preequilibrated at the appropriate pH (Pharmacia; 15 mg of ubiquitin/ml of resin), and the major chain product was purified by elution with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.5 m). Fractions spanning the peak region were examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining before pooling. Concentration and buffer exchange were carried out using Ultrafree-4 or -15 devices (Millipore). Ub4 and Ub8 were resolved by gel filtration on a 1 × 50-cm column of Sephadex G-75 (Sigma) buffered with 50 mm ammonium acetate (pH 5.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. For Ub4, the incubation (0.25 ml) was carried out as described for engineered chains (above), except that the reactants were K48R-ubiquitin (∼3 mg/ml) and Ub3 assembled from wild type ubiquitin (∼12 mg/ml). The Ub3 was largely des-Gly-Gly at its proximal terminus. After 2 h of incubation (37 °C), E1 and E2-25K were removed by passage through an anion exchange column (above), and Ub4was purified by gradient elution (above) from a fast protein liquid chromatography Mono S column (Pharmacia). Cation exchange was also used to resolve Ub2 and Ub3 from mixed chains assembled from wild type ubiquitin (38Pickart C.M. Haldeman M.T. Kasperek E.M. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14223-14418Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Incubations of 2 ml contained (pH 8.0, 37 °C) 50 mm Tris-HCl (50% base), 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm ATPγS (Boehringer Mannheim), 8 μm Ubal, 10 mm DTT, 0.3 unit/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase, 3 mg/ml fraction II protein, 0.3 mg/ml H6-ubiquitin, and ∼4 × 107 cpm of125I-lysozyme (40–50 μg). After 2 h, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (to quench DTT and inactivate ubiquitin pathway enzymes) was added together with 4m urea and 10 mm imidazole. The quenched incubation was applied to a 1-ml column of Ni-NTA agarose (Novagen) preequilibrated with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (50% base), 0.15 m NaCl, 9 m urea, and 25 mm imidazole. The loaded column was washed with equilibration buffer. H6-ubiquitin conjugates were eluted with 4 ml of equilibration buffer supplemented with 1 mimidazole. The eluate was dialyzed overnight against 2 liters of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. The dialyzed sample was concentrated to ∼0.5 ml by ultrafiltration (Centricon-10). Analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography showed that 15–20% of the 125I-lysozyme was conjugated to ubiquitin during the initial incubation. About 15% of the conjugates were recovered in the final eluate, and >90% of the125I-lysozyme in the final eluate was conjugated to ubiquitin. The 26 S proteasome was prepared as described (18Hoffman L. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22362-22368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Standard incubations contained (25–50 μl; pH 7.3, 37 °C) 50 mm Tris-HCl (24% base), 5 mmMgCl2, 10% v/v glycerol, 10 mm DTT, 1.5 or 3 μm Ubal, 2 mm ATP, 10 mmphosphocreatine, 0.3 unit/ml creatine phosphokinase, 0.3 unit/ml pyrophosphatase, 0.37 mg/ml 26 S proteasome (0.18 μmbased on a molecular mass of 2.1 MDa), and ∼5,000–8,000 cpm of125I-lysozyme conjugates (∼30 nm lysozyme; above). The lysozyme conjugates also contributed H6-ubiquitin at a final concentration of ∼10 μm. Only a small fraction of this H6-ubiquitin was conjugated to 125I-lysozyme; of the remainder, some was unconjugated, and some was conjugated to fraction II proteins (the conjugated:unconjugated ratio is unknown). Ubal was included to inhibit disassembly of polyubiquitin chains by one or more isopeptidases in the 26 S proteasome preparation; control experiments showed that 1.5–3 μm Ubal completely inhibited polyubiquitin chain disassembly but"

The reduction of selenate to selenite is catalyzed by a selenate reductase, previously shown to be located in the periplasmic space of the cell. This study describes the purification of the enzyme from T. selenatis grown anaerobically with selenate. The enzyme is a trimeric αβγ complex with an apparent M rof 180,000. The α, β, and γ subunits are 96 kDa, 40 kDa, and 23 kDa, respectively, in size. The selenate reductase contains molybdenum, iron, and acid-labile sulfur as prosthetic group constituents. UV-visible absorption spectroscopy also revealed the presence of one cytochrome b per αβγ complex. TheK m for selenate was determined to be 16 μm, and the V max was 40 μmol/min/mg of protein. The enzyme is specific for the reduction of selenate; nitrate, nitrite, chlorate, and sulfate were not reduced at detectable rates. These studies constitute the first description of a selenate reductase, which represents a new class of enzymes.

Selenate is an abundant oxyanion in some habitats, particularly in agricultural drainage waters from seleniferous soils (1Cantafio A.W. Hagen K.D. Lewis G.E. Bledsoe T.L. Nunan K.M. Macy J.M. Appl.

High concentrations of selenium oxyanions can have detrimental effects on wildlife such as bird species in the Kesterson Reservoir (5Saiki M. Lowe P.T. Arch. Environ. Contam.

Unlike insoluble elemental selenium, selenate is difficult to remove from contaminated water due to its high solubility. The biological reduction of selenate to elemental selenium is therefore of interest as a potential strategy for bioremediation. Although the reduction of selenate in sediments has been reported (2Oremland R.S. Steinberg N.A. Presser T.S. Miller L.G. Appl. Environ.

These organisms include Thauera selenatis and two bacteria designated SES-1 and SES-3 (7Oremland R.S. Hollibaugh J.T. Maest A.S. Presser T.S. Miller L.G. Culbertson C.W. Appl. Environ.

T. selenatis is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium of the beta subclass of the Proteobacteria that was isolated from selenate contaminated waste water in the San Joaquin Valley (9Macy J.M. Michel T.A. Kirsch D.G. FEMS Microbiol. Letters. 1989; 61: 195-198Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It reduces selenate to selenite (9Macy J.M. Michel T.A. Kirsch D.G. FEMS Microbiol. Letters. 1989; 61: 195-198Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Nitrate and oxygen can be utilized as alternative electron acceptors (10Macy J.M. Rech S. Auling G. Dorsch M. Stackebrandt E. Sly L.I. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1993; 43: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A variety of compounds including acetate, lactate, pyruvate, certain sugars, amino acids, fatty acids, di- and tricarboxylic acids, and benzoate can serve as electron donors and carbon sources (10Macy J.M. Rech S. Auling G. Dorsch M. Stackebrandt E. Sly L.I. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1993; 43: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). T. selenatis was the first characterized organism to be used to reduce selenate to selenite in a biological reactor system for selenium oxyanion bioremediation (1Cantafio A.W. Hagen K.D. Lewis G.E. Bledsoe T.L. Nunan K.M. Macy J.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3298-3303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lawson S. Macy J.M. Appl. Microbiol.

During active denitrification in the biological reactor, selenite was further reduced to elemental selenium (13Macy J.M. Lawson S. DeMoll-Decker H. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1993; 40: 588-594Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Little is known about the biochemistry of selenate reduction to selenite by either T. selenatis or SES-3. Selenate may be reduced by a specific selenate reductase or, alternatively, by an enzyme of the nitrate reduction pathway as was suggested previously (11Oremland R.S. Blum J.S. Culbertson C.W. Visscher P.T. Miller L.G. Dowdle P. Strohmaier F.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3011-3019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In T. selenatis the activity of selenate reductase was detected in the periplasmic space, whereas nitrate reductase activity was found in the cytoplasmic membrane (14Rech S.A. Macy J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7316-7320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the reduction of selenate and nitrate could be catalyzed by two independent enzymes. The objective of this study was to purify and characterize the selenate reductase from T. selenatis. The purified enzyme consists of three heterologous subunits, designated α, β, and γ, and contains molybdenum, iron, and acid-labile sulfur atoms as well as heme b as cofactor constituents. This work represents the first report of the purification of a selenate reductase. T. selenatis was grown anaerobically at 28 °C in a mineral salts medium containing yeast extract (0.4%), selenate (10 mm), and acetate (10 mm), as described previously (9Macy J.M. Michel T.A. Kirsch D.G. FEMS Microbiol. Letters. 1989; 61: 195-198Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For routine cell transfers, T. selenatis was cultured in 10-ml anaerobic culture tubes. For enzyme purification, T. selenatis was grown in 5 liter batch cultures. Cultures were harvested during late log phase (after 16–18 h growth) at a final optical density (A 600) of 0.6–0.7. Typical cell yields were 3.0–3.6-g cells (wet weight) per 5 liters of culture. Enzyme purification was performed under aerobic conditions at 4 °C unless indicated otherwise. Cells were chilled on ice (0 °C), harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g, and washed once with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8. The periplasmic fraction was prepared by the method of Osborn and Munson (15Osborn M.J. Munson R. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 642-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Throughout the procedure the bacteria were stirred gently on ice. Cells were resuspended in 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, and 0.75 msucrose at a ratio of 0.45 g wet weight cells per ml of buffer. Following incubation of the cell suspension for 5 min at 0 °C, lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mg/ml, and incubation was continued for an additional 2 min. Two volumes of an ice cold solution of 15 mm EDTA were then added slowly over a period of 10 min. The suspension was stirred for another 10 min on ice and then placed at 37 °C for 10 min to permit the formation of spheroplasts. The spheroplasts were removed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant fraction represented the periplasmic contents of the cells and contained greater than 90% of the selenate reductase activity (data not shown (14Rech S.A. Macy J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7316-7320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The proteins in the periplasmic fraction were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (50–80% saturation). The precipitated material was collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 25,000 ×g and resuspended in 50 mm piperazine/HCl, pH 6, containing 2 m(NH4)2SO4. The solution was loaded directly onto a 1-ml phenyl-Sepharose high performance hydrophobic interaction column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) that had been equilibrated with the piperazine-2 m(NH4)2SO4 buffer. All chromatography procedures were performed at room temperature. After washing the column with 2 volumes of piperazine buffer containing 2m (NH4)2SO4, the selenate reductase was eluted from the column with a 2–0 m(NH4)2SO4 gradient in piperazine buffer. During chromatography, the protein concentration was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. Following elution, fractions containing the selenate reductase were pooled and concentrated by centrifugation using a centriprep-30 concentrator (Amicon). The resulting fraction was loaded onto a Superose 12 gel filtration column (Pharmacia) that had been equilibrated with 50 mmpiperazine/HCl, pH 6. The selenate reductase was eluted in the same buffer, and the fractions containing the selenate reductase activity were concentrated and stored at −80 °C. Selenate reductase activity was determined using an anaerobic cuvette assay by monitoring the oxidation of reduced benzyl viologen (1 mm) with selenate (10 mm) at 546 nm, as described previously (14Rech S.A. Macy J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7316-7320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reduced methyl viologen (0.3 mm) was used as an alternative electron donor where indicated. Alternate electron acceptors (10 mm) that were tested included nitrate, nitrite, sulfate, and chlorate. All enzyme activities were measured at pH 6, the pH optimum of the selenate reductase, in 100 mm piperazine/HCl (14Rech S.A. Macy J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7316-7320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined with Biuret and Bradford reagents, using bovine serum albumin as the standard (16Bode C. Goebell H. Staehler E. Z. Klin. Chem. Klin. Biochem. 1969; 6: 419-422Google Scholar). The apparent molecular mass of the selenate reductase was determined using Superose 12 gel filtration (Pharmacia) chromatography. The column was developed using 20 mm piperazine/HCl, pH 6, and 100 mmNaCl at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The following molecular weight standards were used: ferritin (M r 1The abbreviation used is:M r, relative molecular mass. 440,000), catalase (M r 232,000), aldolase (M r 158,000), albumin (M r67,000), ovalbumin (M r 43,000), and chymotrypsin A (M r 25,000). Dextran blue was used to determine the void volume of the column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia). The oxidized and dithionite-reduced spectrum of the purified enzyme was recorded on a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer. Protein samples were prepared in 2.5% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.005% bromphenol blue as described (17Schröder I. Wolin C.D. Cavicchioli R. Gunsalus R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4985-4992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After heating for 5 min at 90 °C, 1 μl of the sample was applied to a 12.5% homogenous polyacrylamide SDS gel (Phastsystem, Pharmacia). Precast polyacrylamide gels and SDS buffer strips were purchased from Pharmacia. Non-heme iron was determined using the method of Brumbly and Massey (18Brumbly P.E. Massey V. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 463-474Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Molybdenum and nickel were determined using induced coupled plasma mass spectroscopy performed by the DANR analytical laboratory, University of California, Davis. Acid-labile sulfur was determined using the method of King and Morris (19King T.E. Morris R.O. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 634-641Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The selenium content of the enzyme could not be accurately estimated because the organism had been grown in the presence of high levels of selenate. The three subunits of the selenate reductase were blotted from a SDS-polyacrylamide gel onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore). N-terminal amino acid sequence determination was carried out according to the method of Edman and Begg (20Edman P. Begg G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2410) Google Scholar) by the microsequencing facility at the University of California at Davis (α and β subunits) and the School of Biochemistry, La Trobe University, Bundoora, Australia (γ subunit). Methyl viologen, benzyl viologen, and piperazine were obtained from Sigma, and sodium selenate was obtained from Aldrich. All other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. The selenate reductase from T. selenatis was purified from the periplasmic fraction of cells grown anaerobically with selenate as the terminal electron acceptor. Using phenyl-Sepharose high performance hydrophobic interaction and Superose 12 gel filtration chromatography, a 57-fold enrichment of the enzyme was achieved (TableI). After the final purification step, the enzyme was greater than 99% pure based on SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (Fig. 1). The selenate reductase consists of three subunits with relative molecular weights of 96,000, 40,000, and 23,000 as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). Using gel filtration, the relative molecular weight of the native enzyme was determined to be 180,000 (data not shown). The experimentally determined size of the protein is comparable to the calculated relative molecular weight of 159,000 assuming that all subunits are present in a 1:1:1 stoichiometry. This suggests that the selenate reductase is a heterotrimer composed of an α, β, and γ subunit.Table ISummary of the purification of the selenate reductase from T. selenatisPurification stepProteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationmgunits 1-aUnits are defined as μmol of selenate reduced/min.units/mg-foldCell extract4933590.730Periplasmic fraction1031251.211.7(NH4)2SO4precipitate372576.959.5Phenyl-Sepharose2.55321.229.0Superose 121.45841.456.71-a Units are defined as μmol of selenate reduced/min. Open table in a new tab The purified selenate reductase exhibited a visible absorbance spectrum characteristic of b-type cytochromes (Fig.2). The absorbance maxima of the reduced enzyme were 424, 528, and 558 nm, whereas the absorbance maximum of the oxidized form was 415 nm. The cytochrome content was determined to be 1 mol of heme b per mol of enzyme based on the molar extinction coefficient of cytochrome b (21Smith L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 22: 202-212Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and the calculated molecular weight of the selenate reductase complex. The analysis of the purified selenate reductase for total iron and acid-labile sulfur revealed the presence of 12.9 and 8 mol per mol of enzyme (based on a M r of 159,000), respectively. This suggests the presence of at least two [Fe-S] center prosthetic groups. Induced coupled plasma mass spectroscopy spectral analysis of the purified enzyme revealed 1 mol molybdenum per mol of enzyme complex. Nickel was not detected. The purified selenate reductase exhibited a high specificity for its substrate, selenate. With reduced benzyl viologen as the electron donor, theK m for selenate was determined to be 16 μm. Selenate reductase exhibits aV max of 40 μmol of selenate reduced min−1 mg−1 (data not shown), which corresponds to an enzyme turnover number of 387 s−1. Reduced methyl viologen could also serve as an electron donor, although the specific activity of selenate reduction was 11-fold lower than the activity as measured with reduced benzyl viologen (TableII). NADH, succinate, and lactate did not act as electron donors for selenate reduction by the purified enzyme (data not shown). Other oxyanions such as nitrate, nitrite, and chlorate did not serve as electron acceptors for the selenate reductase (Table II).Table IIThe purified selenate reductase from T. selenatis is specific for selenateElectron acceptorActivityReduced benzyl viologenReduced methyl viologenμmol/min/mg proteinSelenate15.91.36Nitrate—2-a—, activities could not be determined because this compound was rapidly reduced by reduced benzyl viologen in the absence of the enzyme.<0.01Sulfate<0.01<0.01Chlorate—2-a—, activities could not be determined because this compound was rapidly reduced by reduced benzyl viologen in the absence of the enzyme.<0.01Nitrite—2-a—, activities could not be determined because this compound was rapidly reduced by reduced benzyl viologen in the absence of the enzyme.<0.012-a —, activities could not be determined because this compound was rapidly reduced by reduced benzyl viologen in the absence of the enzyme.

The periplasmic enzyme from T. selenatisis specific for selenate reduction to selenite. This reduction is coupled to cell growth suggesting that the selenate reductase is part of an electron transport chain that generates an electrochemical gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane (9Macy J.M. Michel T.A. Kirsch D.G. FEMS Microbiol. Letters. 1989; 61: 195-198Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 22Macy J.M. Lawson S. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 160: 295-298Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The properties of the selenate reductase are summarized in TableIV. The enzyme is a complex consisting of three heterologous subunits, and it contains molybdenum, iron, acid-labile sulfide, and heme b as cofactor constituents. The purified enzyme exhibits a high affinity for selenate. Its K m is in the lower range of the affinities reported for in situselenate reduction activities in a variety of sediments (K m = 7.9–720 μm) (4Steinberg N.A. Oremland R.S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 3550-3557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nitrate, nitrite, chlorate, and sulfate do not serve as substrates. The enzyme is therefore clearly not part of another oxyanion reduction pathway. Previously reported cell yield determinations for selenate reduction with acetate as the electron donor indicated that T. selenatis formed ATP exclusively by electron transport phosphorylation (22Macy J.M. Lawson S. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 160: 295-298Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The periplasmic location of the enzyme is logical, considering the need of the organism to protect itself from the toxic effects of selenite. However, the mechanism by which selenate reduction is coupled to the cytoplasmic membrane so that energy can be conserved is not yet known. In contrast, selenite was demonstrated not to support growth of T. selenatis (23DeMoll-Decker H. Macy J.M. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 160: 241-247Google Scholar). Selenite is the major product of anaerobic respiration when T. selenatis is grown with selenate as the sole electron acceptor, whereas some minor reduction of selenite to elemental selenium may occur (9Macy J.M. Michel T.A. Kirsch D.G. FEMS Microbiol. Letters. 1989; 61: 195-198Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Complete reduction of selenite takes place when both nitrate and selenate are available as electron acceptors (13Macy J.M. Lawson S. DeMoll-Decker H. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1993; 40: 588-594Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (see below).Table IVProperties of the T. selenatis selenate reductaseSubunit size Experimental from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresisα96 kDaβ40 kDaγ23 kDaNative size Superose gel filtration180 kDaCofactor content4-amol/mol of enzyme based on M r159,000.

Open table in a new tab The subunit composition and the cofactor content of the selenate reductase from T. selenatis bears some resemblance to the periplasmic dimethylsulfide:acceptor oxidoreductase fromRhodobacter sulfidophilus (24Hanlon S.P. Toh T.-H. Solomon P.S. Holt R.A. McEwan A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Like the selenate reductase, the dimethylsulfide:acceptor oxidoreductase is a heterotrimer consisting of three subunits with molecular masses of 94, 38, and 32 kDa that are similar to the selenate reductase subunits (Table IV). Dimethylsulfide:acceptor oxidoreductase contains a pterin molybdenum cofactor, a cytochrome b, and possibly one [Fe-S] center. The enzyme may provide electrons to the photosynthetic electron transport chain when R. sulfidophilus is grown in light with dimethylsulfide as the electron donor. The physiological electron acceptor of dimethylsulfide:acceptor oxidoreductase that may transfer the electrons to the membrane-bound photosynthetic reaction center is not known. Selenate reductase is dissimilar to the periplasmic nitrate reductases that have been purified from Rhodobacter sphaeroides,Alcaligenes eutrophus, and Thiosphaera pantotropha (3Siddiqui R.A. Warnecke-Eberz U. Hengsberger A. Schneider B. Kostka S. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5867-5876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Berks B.C. Richardson D.J. Robinson C. Reilly A. Aplin R.T. Ferguson S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 26Byrne M.D. Nicholas D.J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 915: 120-124Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Reyes F. Roldan M.D. Klipp W. Castillo F. Moreno-Vivian C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These enzymes consist of two subunits containing molybdopterin, possibly one [Fe-S] center and cytochromec as prosthetic groups. The recently reported DNA sequence of the napABC operon from R. sphaeroides revealed the presence of an additional gene encoding NapC (27Reyes F. Roldan M.D. Klipp W. Castillo F. Moreno-Vivian C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Based on its amino acid sequence, NapC should contain a transmembrane helix and has the signatures of heme c binding sites. Sequence homologies to other membrane-bound, cytochrome c-containing subunits of electron transfer proteins led the authors to suggest a role for NapC as the mediator of electron flow between the quinone pool in the cytoplasmic membrane and the periplasmic nitrate reductase, NapAB. In contrast to all of the periplasmic nitrate reductases described thus far, the selenate reductase from T. selenatis does not contain cytochrome c. While the physiological role of the periplasmic nitrate reductases in various organisms is not clear, the selenate reductase of T. selenatis acts as a dissimilatory terminal reductase supporting growth when selenate is present in the environment. T. selenatis can also grow anaerobically with nitrate as the sole terminal electron acceptor (10Macy J.M. Rech S. Auling G. Dorsch M. Stackebrandt E. Sly L.I. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1993; 43: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Nitrate is reduced via the denitrification pathway to N2O (10Macy J.M. Rech S. Auling G. Dorsch M. Stackebrandt E. Sly L.I. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1993; 43: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In the absence of nitrate and/or nitrite, selenate is reduced to selenite, which is not reduced further to a significant extent (9Macy J.M. Michel T.A. Kirsch D.G. FEMS Microbiol. Letters. 1989; 61: 195-198Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). When both selenate and nitrate are present, T. selenatis reduces both substrates concomitantly (14Rech S.A. Macy J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7316-7320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, under these conditions selenite is further reduced to elemental selenium (14Rech S.A. Macy J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7316-7320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests a possible involvement of the denitrification pathway enzymes in the reduction of selenite to selenium. Two recent findings suggest that the nitrite reductase may catalyze the reduction of selenite to selenium (23DeMoll-Decker H. Macy J.M. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 160: 241-247Google Scholar): first, both nitrite reductase activity and the ability to reduce selenite are low in cells grown in the absence of nitrate and/or nitrite. Second, a T. selenatis mutant was isolated that was defective in both nitrite and selenite reduction. The physiological significance of selenite reduction in the presence of nitrate is not known. In addition to T. selenatis, the anaerobic Gram-negative isolate SES-3 was described as being able to grow using selenate respiration with lactate as the electron donor (11Oremland R.S. Blum J.S. Culbertson C.W. Visscher P.T. Miller L.G. Dowdle P. Strohmaier F.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3011-3019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from its ability to reduce selenate to selenite, strain SES-3 bears little resemblance to T. selenatis. Not only is SES-3 a strict anaerobe that is unable to use acetate as the electron donor, but it requires both peptone and yeast extract in the medium for growth (9Macy J.M. Michel T.A. Kirsch D.G. FEMS Microbiol. Letters. 1989; 61: 195-198Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar,11Oremland R.S. Blum J.S. Culbertson C.W. Visscher P.T. Miller L.G. Dowdle P. Strohmaier F.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3011-3019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phylogenetic position of SES-3 has yet to be established. LikeT. selenatis, SES-3 can utilize nitrate as an alternative electron acceptor to support growth; however, nitrate is reduced to ammonium. In strain SES-3, selenate and nitrate reduction appear to be regulated. In the presence of nitrate, the rate of selenate reduction was 2-fold lower than in cells grown in the absence of nitrate (11Oremland R.S. Blum J.S. Culbertson C.W. Visscher P.T. Miller L.G. Dowdle P. Strohmaier F.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3011-3019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, the rate of nitrate reduction was reduced 5-fold in selenate grown cells as compared with cells grown with nitrate. This differential regulation of selenate and nitrate reduction suggests that, like T. selenatis, SES-3 has two distinct reductases, a selenate reductase and a nitrate reductase. Therefore, in contrast to a previously stated hypothesis that selenate reduction to selenite is catalyzed by nitrate reductase (28Oremland R.S. Frankenberger Jr., W.T. Selenium in the Environment. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1993: 389-419Google Scholar), T. selenatis and probably SES-3 reduce selenate by using a selenate reductase. Several other bacteria including Wolinella succinogenes(29Tomei F.A. Barton L.L. Lemanski C.L. Zocco T.G. Can. J. Microbiol. 1992; 38: 1328-1333Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar), a Pseudomonas stutzeri isolate (30Lortie L. Gould W.D. Rajan S. McCready R.G.L. Cheng K.-J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 4042-4044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), andBacillus subtilis (31Garbisu C. Gonzales S. Yang W.-H. Yee B.C. Carlson D.L. Yee A. Smith N.R. Otero R. Buchanan B.B. Leighton T. Biofactors. 1995; 5: 29-37PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown to reduce either selenate or selenite to elemental selenium. None of these organisms, however, can conserve energy when reducing selenate or selenite. Biophysical studies of the selenate reductase, as well as the cloning and DNA sequence analysis of the genes for the α, β, and γ subunits are in progress and will reveal additional information regarding the mechanism of selenate reduction."

Computer-assisted hydropathy analyses and multiple sequence alignments suggest several topological models for MRP. To aid in determining the topology most likely to be correct, we have identified which of the 14N-glycosylation sequons in this protein are utilized. Limited proteolysis of MRP-enriched membranes and deglycosylation of intact MRP and its tryptic fragments with PNGase F was carried out followed by immunoblotting with antibodies known to react with specific regions of MRP. The results obtained indicated that the sequon at Asn354 in the middle MSD is not utilized and suggested approximate sites of N-glycosylation. Subsequent site-directed mutagenesis studies established that Asn19and Asn23 in the NH2-terminal MSD and Asn1006 in the COOH-terminal MSD are the only sites in MRP that are modified with N-linked oligosaccharides.N-Glycosylation of Asn19 and Asn23provides the first direct experimental evidence that MRP has an extracytosolic NH2 terminus. This finding, together with those of previous studies, strongly suggests that the NH2-terminal MSD of MRP contains an odd number of transmembrane helices.

MRP and P-glycoprotein belong to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transport proteins but share only 15% amino acid identity (1Cole S.P.C. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E.

Nevertheless, both proteins confer resistance to a broad range of cytotoxic xenobiotics including doxorubicin, vincristine, and VP-16 (etoposide), drugs that are widely used in the treatment of many human cancers. However, there is growing evidence that the mechanisms by which MRP and P-glycoprotein reduce cellular drug accumulation are not the same, suggesting that there are major differences in the drug-protein interactions of these two molecules (6Loe D.W.

Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar). To understand how drugs interact with P-glycoprotein, there has been considerable interest in determining the precise topology of this integral membrane protein. Investigations in most experimental systems support a model in which P-glycoprotein is organized as a symmetrically arranged, tandemly duplicated molecule with each half consisting of six transmembrane segments followed by a NBD (10Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15414-15419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but alternate models have also been proposed (11Zhang J.-T. Ling V. J. Biol.

At present, little is known about the membrane topology of MRP. The topological model we proposed when MRP was cloned in 1992 was based on computer-assisted hydropathy analyses of its deduced amino acid sequence and alignment with the predicted structure ofltpgpA (1Cole S.P.C. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M.V. Deeley R.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). LtpgpA is an ABC protein cloned fromLeishmania tarentolae which was the most closely related protein to MRP known at that time (13Ouellette M. Fase-Fowler F. Borst P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In the original model, we suggested that MRP consisted of eight transmembrane segments and an NBD in its NH2-proximal half and only four transmembrane segments and an NBD in its COOH-proximal half (1Cole S.P.C. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M.V. Deeley R.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). More recently, alignment of the hydropathy profiles of human MRP with those of its murine ortholog (14Stride B.D. Valdimarsson G. Gerlach J.H. Wilson G.M. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 962-971PubMed Google Scholar) and several members of the ABC superfamily (including the related sulfonylurea receptor, SUR (15Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W.

In this later model, we predicted that MRP contains two MSDs of six transmembrane helices in a “6 + 6” configuration typical of several eukaryotic ABC transporters (9Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar), plus an extremely hydrophobic NH2-terminal MSD of approximately 220 amino acids (4Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Eur. J.

Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 962-971PubMed Google Scholar). One approach to defining the topology of integral membrane glycoproteins is to identify amino acids that are modified byN-linked oligosaccharides (19Chang X.-B. Hou Y.-X. Jensen T.J. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18572-18575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Schinkel A.H. Kemp S. Dolle M. Rudenko G. Wagenaar E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The co-translational attachment of high mannose oligosaccharides to nascent polypeptide chains occurs on asparagine residues in the sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr, where X can be any amino acid except proline (21Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3776) Google Scholar, 22Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Spitalnik S.L. Kasturi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6363-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). This process is carried out by an oligosaccharyltransferase localized on the lumenal side of the endoplasmic reticulum, so that only asparagine residues that are extracytosolic are glycosylated (23Kaplan H.A. Welply J.K. Lennarz W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We and others (24Almquist K.C. Loe D.W. Hipfner D.R. Mackie J.E. Cole S.P.C.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3658-3661PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that MRP is N-glycosylated with complex-type oligosaccharides. We have also shown recently that limited proteolysis of MRP cleaves the protein in the region connecting the first NBD (NBD1) and the COOH-proximal MSD (MSD3) producing twoN-glycosylated fragments. These observations indicated that asparagine residues in both halves of MRP were modified with oligosaccharides (18Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Stride B.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3307-3314PubMed Google Scholar). Bakos et al. (26Bakos E. Hegedus T. Hollo Z. Welker E. Tusnady G.E. Zaman G.J.R. Flens M.J. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol.

However, which specific N-glycosylation sequons in MSD1 and MSD3 are used and whether the middle MSD (MSD2) is also glycosylated is not known. In the present study, we have carried out more extensive analyses of the partial proteolysis products of MRP together with site-directed mutagenesis of selected asparagine residues to identify the sites of N-linked glycosylation in this protein. The results obtained place constraints on the possible topologies of MRP and indicate that the NH2 terminus of the protein is localized to the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane. SV40-transformed Cos-1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The MRP-overexpressing, multidrug-resistant H69AR small cell lung cancer cell line has been described previously (1Cole S.P.C. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C.

T14 cells are a HeLa cell population transfected with an episomally replicating pCEBV7 expression construct containing a full-length cDNA encoding human MRP (3Cole S.P.C. Sparks K.E. Fraser K.

Monoclonal antibody (mAb) QCRL-1 is a murine mAb that reacts with the heptapeptide918SSYSGDI924 in the connector region of MRP (Centocor, Malvern, PA) (18Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Stride B.D.

MRP-1 is a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against a peptide from NBD1 of MRP (765GVNLSGGQKQRVSLA779) (18Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Stride B.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3307-3314PubMed Google Scholar) and was purified as described (24Almquist K.C. Loe D.W. Hipfner D.R. Mackie J.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 102-110PubMed Google Scholar). The rat mAb MRPr1 and the mouse mAb MRPm6 were raised against fusion proteins containing MRP amino acids 194–360 and MRP amino acids 1294–1430 plus 1497–1531, respectively (28Flens M.J. Izquierdo M.A. Scheffer G.L. Fritz J.M. Meijer C.J.L.M. Scheper R.J. Zaman G.J.R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4557-4563PubMed Google Scholar). Both mAbs were kindly provided by Dr. R. J. Scheper (Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The locations of membrane spanning helices in human MRP were predicted using the algorithms of Eisenberget al. (29Eisenberg D. Schwarz E. Komaromy M. Wall R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar), Klein et al. (30Klein P. Kanehisa M. DeLisi C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 815: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), Argos et al. (31Argos P. Rao J.K.M. Hargrave P.A. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3038-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). The topology of MRP was also predicted by the neural network system PredictProtein using a multiple sequence alignment that included human and murine MRP/mrp, human and rabbit multispecific organic anion transporters (MOAT/epithelial basolateral conductance regulator), and yeast YCF1 (33Rost B. Fariselli P. Casadio R. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1704-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The assembly of a full-length MRP cDNA in pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) has been described (2Grant C.E. Valdimarsson G. Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 357-361PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA was transferred into pcDNAI/Amp (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) to generate the pcDNAI-MRP1 expression vector. The asparagine codons of potential N-glycosylation acceptor sites at positions 19, 23, 71, 1006, and 1156 of MRP were converted to glutamine codons by site-directed mutagenesis. The N23Q and N71Q mutations were generated by a modification of the PCR-based megaprimer method (34Boles E. Miosga T. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 197-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A template was prepared by cloning the BamHI fragment from pcDNAI-MRP1 (containing the first 840 nucleotides of MRP coding sequence, plus 86 nucleotides of 5′-untranslated region and a portion of the pcDNAI/Amp multiple cloning site) into pBluescript SK+ in both orientations. The first PCR was carried out on the pBluescript construct containing the BamHI fragment cloned in the EcoRI toHindIII orientation (5′ → 3′) using the M13 primer and either the N23Q (5′-C ACG TGG CAA ACC AGC AAC CCC GAC T-3′) or the N71Q (5′-A CCT CTC CAG AAA ACC AAA ACT GCC T-3′) mutagenic primer (substituted nucleotide positions underlined). The purified PCR product then served as a megaprimer in a second PCR reaction, along with the M13 primer, using the pBluescript construct with the BamHI insert in theHindIII to EcoRI orientation (5′ → 3′) as a template. The final PCR product was then digested with BamHI and cloned back into pBluescript SK+. The N19Q, N1006Q, and N1156Q mutations were generated using the TransformerTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) based on the method developed by Deng and Nickoloff (35Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The templates for mutagenesis were prepared by cloning the BamHI fragment as above (for N19Q) and the XmaI fragment (MRP nucleotides 2337–4322) (for N1006Q and N1156Q) from pcDNAI-MRP1 into pGEM®-3Z (Promega, Madison, WI). Mutagenesis was then performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using the ScaI/StuI and SspI/EcoRV selection primers (for N19Q and N1006Q/N1156Q mutations, respectively), and the following sense mutagenic oligonucleotide primers: 5′-C TGG GAC TGGCAG GTC ACG TGG-3′ (N19Q), 5′-C CCC ATC GTCCAG GGG ACT CAG G-3′ (N1006Q), and 5′-C TAT TCC CAT TTC CAG GAG ACC TTG C-3′ (N1156Q). The N19Q/N23Q double mutant was also generated by this method using the N19Q mutagenic primer with the N23Q BamHI fragment in pGEM®-3Z as a template. After confirming all mutations by dideoxy sequencing using SequenaseTM version 2.0 (U.S. Biochemical Corp.), DNA fragments containing the desired mutations were transferred back into pcDNAI-MRP1. The N19Q/N23Q/N1006Q triple mutant was prepared by cloning the BamHI fragment containing the N19Q/N23Q mutation into pcDNAI-MRP1/N1006Q. All regions that were synthesized by PCR or by T4 DNA polymerase (when the TransformerTM protocol was used) were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the final constructs. pcDNAI-MRP1 expression vectors encoding wild-type and mutant forms of MRP were transiently transfected into Cos-1 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada). Briefly, 5 × 105 cells per well were seeded in 6-well plates, and 24 h later, cells were washed and overlaid with 1 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 μg of supercoiled DNA and 8 μl of LipofectAMINE. After 4 h, 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% calf serum was added to each well. The medium was replaced after 24 h with 2 ml of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% calf serum, and the cells were incubated for a further 24–48 h before harvesting. Membrane-enriched fractions were prepared as described previously (27Hipfner D.R. Gauldie S.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5788-5792PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane pellets were resuspended in Tris sucrose buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5), aliquoted, and frozen at −70 °C. After thawing, membranes were disaggregated by passage through a 27-gauge needle. For proteolysis, membrane proteins were diluted to 2–3 μg/μl in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 37 °C with diphenylcarbamyl chloride-treated trypsin (ICN Biomedicals, St. Laurent, Quebec, Canada) at trypsin:membrane protein ratios of 1:30 to 1:810 (w:w) for 30 min. Proteolysis was stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and leupeptin. After centrifugation, membrane pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4.8 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. In some experiments, membranes were treated with protein N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (New England Biolabs, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) (24Almquist K.C. Loe D.W. Hipfner D.R. Mackie J.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 102-110PubMed Google Scholar). Sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, was added to membrane proteins to a final concentration of 50 mm in the absence of detergents, followed by PNGase F (10–15 New England Biolabs units/μg protein), and the samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Samples were solubilized and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis essentially as described (2Grant C.E. Valdimarsson G. Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G.

Immunoblotting was performed as described (18Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Stride B.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3307-3314PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hipfner D.R. Gauldie S.D.

The amino acid sequence of MRP contains 14N-glycosylation sequons (1Cole S.P.C. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M.V. Deeley R.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). Of these, eight are in either NBD1 or NBD2 or in the connector region that joins the two halves of the protein (Fig. 1). Previous studies of MRP and other ABC transport proteins indicate that these regions are cytoplasmic (18Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Stride B.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3307-3314PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chang X.-B. Hou Y.-X. Jensen T.J. Riordan J.R. J. Biol.

Cancer. 1996; 67: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Consequently, these eight sites are not expected to be modified with N-linked oligosaccharides. Of the remaining six sequons, three reside in MSD1 (Asn19, Asn23, and Asn71), one is in MSD2 (Asn354), and two are found in MSD3 (Asn1006and Asn1156). Analyses of the MRP sequence using various algorithms for predicting the locations of membrane spanning helices suggested several topological models of MRP (29Eisenberg D. Schwarz E. Komaromy M. Wall R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar, 30Klein P. Kanehisa M. DeLisi C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 815: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 31Argos P. Rao J.K.M. Hargrave P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The topology of MSD1 varied according to the algorithm used, with the predicted number of transmembrane segments ranging from four to six (Fig. 1, left, A-D). As a result, differences in the orientation of the NH2 terminus and the potential sites ofN-glycosylation were also predicted. Models A andD possess six and four transmembrane segments, respectively, and the NH2 terminus is cytoplasmic. Consequently, Asn71 is the only potential site ofN-glycosylation. In contrast, MSD1 in model B has five transmembrane segments and an extracytoplasmic NH2terminus. Accordingly, Asn19 and Asn23 are both potential N-glycosylation acceptors and Asn71 is not. Finally, in model C, the positions of the four predicted transmembrane segments place all threeN-glycosylation sequons in the cytosolic NH2terminus, where they are inaccessible for glycosylation. As with MSD1, the predicted topology of MSD2 varied according to the algorithm used. On the basis of previous comparative hydropathy analyses, we and others (4Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32: 945-957Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 9Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar, 14Stride B.D.

Varadi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol.

This topology predicts that Asn354 in MSD2 is localized to the lumenal or extracellular face of the membrane and is thus a potential site ofN-glycosylation. The predictions of the different algorithms for the topology of MSD3 were more consistent than for MSD1 and MSD2. Two of the models suggest that MSD3 contains six transmembrane segments, as we and others have proposed previously (4Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Eur. J.

In these models, Asn1006 is the only potentialN-glycosylation acceptor in this domain. In contrast, the other two models predict that MSD3 possesses only four transmembrane segments, as proposed in our original “8 + 4” model of MRP (1Cole S.P.C. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E.

According to these models, both Asn1006 and Asn1156 are extracytosolic and thus potential sites for N-glycosylation. To localize the approximate sites ofN-glycosylation, MRP-enriched membranes were digested with trypsin and immunoblotted with antibodies known to react with specific regions of MRP. These included the MRP-1 antiserum raised against the synthetic peptide 765GVNLSGGQKQRVSLA779 in NBD1 (18Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Stride B.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4557-4563PubMed Google Scholar) which reacts with a cytoplasmic COOH-terminal formic acid fragment of MRP (amino acids 1389–1531).2 In preliminary experiments, we determined that no proteolytic fragments of MRP were observed after incubation of MRP-transfected HeLa cells with trypsin unless the cells were first permeabilized with digitonin. Since MRP has been shown to be targeted to the plasma membrane in these cells (24Almquist K.C. Loe D.W. Hipfner D.R. Mackie J.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 102-110PubMed Google Scholar), this indicated that all sites of trypsin digestion we have detected are intracellular (not shown). In subsequent experiments, tryptic digests were carried out on crude membrane preparations. MRP-enriched crude membranes from H69AR cells were digested with trypsin at increasing trypsin to membrane protein ratios up to 1:30 (w:w), and the proteolytic products were detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 2). Initially, two polypeptides are produced by digestion of a portion of the connector region of MRP. One is a fragment of approximately 120-kDa detected by mAb MRPr1 and MRP-1 antiserum (and to a lesser extent by mAb QCRL-1) which corresponds to the NH2-proximal half of MRP (i.e. MSD1 + MSD2 + NBD1) (labeled N-1) (Fig. 2, A–C). The second is a fragment of 75–80 kDa detected by mAbs QCRL-1 and MRPm6 corresponding to the COOH-proximal half of MRP (i.e. MSD3 + NBD2) (labeled C-1) (Fig. 2, C and D). We have shown previously that the epitope for mAb QCRL-1 (amino acids 918–924) li"
https://openalex.org/W2092532048,"Recent studies have identified agonist-dependent phosphorylation as a critical event in the rapid uncoupling of the m2 muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChR) from G-proteins and sequestration of the receptors away from the cell surface. However, mutant m2 mAChRs were identified that were phosphorylated but unable to desensitize in adenylyl cyclase assays, while they internalized like wild type (WT) mAChRs. We have tested whether these properties might stem from differences in the abilities of the WT and mutant mAChR to bind arrestins, proteins implicated in both receptor/G-protein uncoupling and internalization. We have determined that arrestin binding requires phosphorylation at a cluster of Ser/Thr residues in amino acids 307–311 in the m2 mAChR. A strong correlation was found between the ability of WT and mutant receptors to bind arrestins in vitro or in vivo and to desensitize in adenylyl cyclase assays. However, the phosphorylation-dependent internalization of the m2 mAChR in HEK-tsA201 cells did not require arrestins and did not proceed via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. While the m2 mAChR was able to enter a clathrin- and arrestin-dependent pathway when arrestin 2 or arrestin 3 was significantly overexpressed, the preferred pathway of internalization of WT and certain mutant m2 mAChR in HEK-tsA201 cells did not involve participation of arrestins. The results suggest that the phosphorylation-mediated regulation of the m2 mAChR may involve arrestin-dependent and -independent events.

Desensitization plays an important role in turning off receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways.

Models of short term desensitization of GPRs posit that activation of GPRs leads to a rapid, agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the GPRs, which in turn allows the GPRs to bind arrestins, proteins that bind to phosphorylated GPRs and preclude further R/G interaction (for review, see Ref. 1Liggett S.B.

The non-visual arrestins, arrestin 2 and arrestin 3 (β-arrestin and β-arrestin 2), but not visual arrestin (arrestin 1), bind both to the activated, phosphorylated β2-AR and to clathrin, to act as adaptors to recruit the β2AR to the endocytic vesicles (3Goodman O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). We have studied the m2 muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChRs) as a model of Gi-coupled GPRs to elucidate molecular events involved in desensitization. In recent studies we have observed that agonist-induced phosphorylation of the m2 mAChR on defined serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) residues in the third intracellular domain (i3 loop) was a key event in initiating both R/G uncoupling and receptor internalization (4Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, results with several mutant m2 mAChRs strongly suggested that distinct downstream events might be involved in R/G uncoupling and internalization (4Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 5Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). An m2 mAChR with four Ser/Thr residues in amino acids 286–290 mutated to alanines (the “NAla4 mutant”) desensitized and internalized similarly to WT type receptor. On the other hand, an m2 mAChR with four Ser/Thr residues in amino acids 307–311 mutated to alanine (the “CAla4 mutant”) was unable to desensitize, but internalized in a manner that was not different from WT m2 mAChR (4Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutation of both Ser/Thr clusters (N,CAla8) abolished agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation, uncoupling from G-proteins, and reduced agonist-induced receptor internalization (4Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The results of these studies suggested that: 1) phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues in the cluster of Ser/Thr residues at aa 307–311 is critical to allow for R/G uncoupling; and 2) multiple pathways of internalization exist, as phosphorylation-dependent internalization was observed in the stable cell lines for the WT, NAla4, and CAla4 mutants, while phosphorylation-independent internalization was observed in the stable cell lines for the N,CAla8 mutant. The results highlight the observation that R/G uncoupling and internalization for the m2 mAChR are likely to occur via distinct pathways downstream of mAChR phosphorylation. We hypothesized that these mutations might have differentially impaired the ability of these receptors to bind arrestin proteins, thus affecting one or more of the regulatory events associated with m2 mAChR desensitization. In this study, we have analyzed the abilities of WT and mutant m2 mAChR to interact with arrestins in vitro and in intact HEK-tsA201 cells.

HEK-tsA201 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method, followed by a 5–6-min shock with 30% Me2SO in DMEM.

LipofectAMINE reagent using the manufacturer's directions, with the same amounts of plasmids used for calcium phosphate transfections. Cells were assayed for receptor internalization 60–72 h post-transfection. Transiently transfected HEK-tsA201 and COS cells expressing WT or mutant m2 mAChRs expressed 1.5–3 pmol of m2 mAChR/mg of total cell protein, as assessed by [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding. Approximately half of expressed mAChRs were present on the cell surface, as measured by [3H]NMS binding. Expression levels of the β2-AR were slightly higher, with 2–3 pmol of receptor/mg of total cell protein expressed on the cell surface, as measured by [3H]CGP-12177 binding. The approach used was to measure changes in the number of receptors located on the cell surface using 2 nm amounts of the hydrophilic ligand, [3H]NMS, which cannot cross cellular membranes. On the second day after transfection, cells from each 100-mm plate were divided equally into five 60-mm plates each, and the cells were allowed to attach overnight. The cells were incubated subsequently for the indicated times with 1 mm carbachol (or other concentration as indicated). At the end of the incubation time, cells were rinsed five times with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, removed from the plates by pipetting with ice-cold HEPES-buffered DMEM:F12, and subjected to radioligand binding with saturating concentrations of [3H]NMS for 2 h at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of 10 μm atropine. Protein assays were performed to control for differences in cell density on each treated plate. Data were expressed as the percent of internalization of receptors, as assessed by a loss of [3H]NMS binding as compared with levels observed in untreated cells. Experiments with the β2-AR were performed in the same manner, using 10 μm isoproterenol to induce internalization of the receptor, which was measured as a reduction in the binding sites for 10 nm [3H]CGP-12177. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells were maintained in spinner cultures of Life Technologies, Inc. Sf900II medium at 27 °C. Large scale infections were performed by infecting 1 × 106cells/ml with a multiplicity of infection of 5 (12Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; 1555: 1-56Google Scholar). Recombinant baculoviruses directing expression of the WT m2 mAChR or the Ser/Thr cluster mutant m2 mAChRs (Table I) were constructed using CLONTECHmaterials. The cDNAs encoding the 6xHis-tagged versions of m2 mAChR, m2-NAla4, m2-CAla4, and m2-N,CAla8 (4Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) were subcloned into pBacPAK9 using EcoRI and PstI to create transfer vectors for the four receptors. Sf9 cells were transfected with transfer vector and commercially linearized BacPAK6 viral DNA using theCLONTECH transfection reagent provided with the linearized viral DNA. Three days after transfection, the culture media containing the recombinant viruses were collected and viral clones were isolated using plaque assays. All plaques analyzed produced recombinant baculovirus that could express m2 mAChR. One supernatant for each receptor construct was chosen for use, and the titer of the virus was determined by end point dilution. The presence of mutant m2 mAChR cDNA in the viruses was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the viral DNA and restriction digests of the resulting product.Table ISummary of WT and mutant m2 mAChR characteristicsReceptorWild type m2 mAChRNAla4 m2 mAChRCAla4m2 mAChRN,CAla8 m2 mAChRMutationsNoneS286A, T287A, S288A, S290AT307A, S309A, T310A, S311AS286A, T287A, S288A, S290A, T307A, S309A, T310A, S311AEC50 of CCh for internalization (μm)1-aMeans ± S.E.; n = 3–8 experiments.4.3 ± 1.46.9 ± 3.311.5 ± 7.59.8 ± 6.7Stoichiometry of in vitro GRK2 phosphorylation (mol P/mol R)1-bMeans ± S.E.; n = 3–4 experiments.4.6 ± 0.73.4 ± 0.53.2 ± 0.51.9 ± 0.3Receptor desensitization++++++NoNoIn vitroarrestin bindingYesYesNoNoIn vivoarrestin interaction (internalization)YesYesNoNo1-a Means ± S.E.; n = 3–8 experiments.1-b Means ± S.E.; n = 3–4 experiments. Open table in a new tab The wild type and mutant m2 mAChRs were purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cell membranes as described previously (13Richardson R.M. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13650-13656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by sequential chromatography over 3-(2′-aminobenzhydroxyl)-tropane-Sepharose and hydroxyapatite columns. The purified receptors were reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles containing 100% phosphatidylserine, and analyzed for [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding activity. Purified, reconstituted receptors were immediately phosphorylated with GRK2 using protocols described previously (13Richardson R.M. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13650-13656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and subsequently stored at −80 °C until used for studies with arrestins. The ability of the m2 mAChR and the Ser/Thr cluster mutants to undergo agonist-dependent phosphorylation by GRK2 was assessed using in vitro assays. Each assay contained 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgSO4, 2 mm EDTA, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 500–2000 cpm/pmol), and 0.1 μm m2 mAChR. Assays were performed in the presence of 1 mm carbachol or 10 μm atropine to assess the agonist dependence of the phosphorylation. GRK2 was used at a concentration of 25 nm. Gβγ subunits from the heterotrimeric G-protein transducin were added at a concentration of 250 nm. Assays were performed at room temperature for 0–60 min, with the maximal stoichiometry of phosphorylation being observed by 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer or by freezing at −80 °C. Interactions between purified m2 mAChRs and arrestins were measured using an established arrestin binding assay (14Gurevich V.V. Richardson R.M. Kim C.M. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16879-16882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified, reconstituted wild type or mutant m2 mAChRs were phosphorylated in large batches (≥50 pmol/reaction, 0.1 pmol/μl of receptor) by GRK2 as described above, but with nonradioactive ATP, or exposed to phosphorylation conditions in the absence of kinase as controls. Parallel small reactions with [γ-32P]ATP were performed to allow calculations of the stoichiometry of phosphorylation. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The receptors were divided into aliquots and stored at −80 °C until used for arrestin binding. The wild type or mutant m2 mAChRs (100 fmol) were incubated for 35 min at 30 °C with 100 fmol of radiolabeled arrestin (prepared as described previously in 14) and 0.1 mm carbachol in 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 50 mm potassium acetate, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mmdithiothreitol, in a total volume of 50 μl. Arrestin-receptor complexes (50 μl volume) were separated from free arrestin by gel filtration over 2-ml Sepharose CL-2B columns, as described previously (14Gurevich V.V. Richardson R.M. Kim C.M. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16879-16882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of arrestins and HA-tagged dynamins was monitored by immunoblotting analyses. Whole cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked for 30 min with 5% powdered milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), and incubated with primary antibody overnight. HA-tagged dynamins were detected using a 1:1000 dilution of mouse anti-HA ascites. Arrestins were detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against an epitope common to all known arrestins, diluted 1:2000 in milk/TBS (15Dua, H. S. (1992) Curr. Eye Res. , 11, (Suppl.), 107–111.Google Scholar). After washing away unbound primary antibody with TBS, the filters were incubated for 2 h with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG. Enhanced chemiluminescence was used to detect antibody staining. Phosphorylation is a key event that facilitates interactions of arrestins with GPRs (1Liggett S.B. Lefkowitz R.J. Sibley D.R. Housley M.D. Regulation of Signal Transduction Pathways by Desensitization and Amplification. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994: 25-67Google Scholar). To begin to elucidate any differences in the arrestin binding properties of the WT and the Ser/Thr cluster mutant m2 mAChRs described earlier (4Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we developed recombinant baculoviruses directing expression of the WT and mutant m2 mAChRs to allow for purification and reconstitution of the receptors and their subsequent use in phosphorylation and arrestin binding assays (13Richardson R.M. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13650-13656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gurevich V.V. Richardson R.M. Kim C.M. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16879-16882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies established that the WT m2 mAChR is an excellent substrate for GRK2 (βARK1) and GRK3 (βARK2) in vitro as it undergoes agonist-dependent phosphorylation to a stoichiometry of 3–5 mol of phosphate (mol of P)/mol of receptor (mol of R) (13Richardson R.M. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13650-13656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was important to compare the phosphorylation of the WT m2 mAChR and the cluster mutants to determine if the pattern of phosphorylation in vitro matched the results we observed in phosphorylation studies performed in vivo. In previous studies in HEK-tsA201 cells, the WT m2 mAChR, m2-NAla4, and m2-CAla4 were all phosphorylated to similar extents (3–5 mol of P/mol of R), while the m2-N,CAla8 mutant lost all agonist-induced phosphorylation (4Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we assessed the ability of the purified WT and mutant m2 mAChRs to serve as substrates for GRK2in vitro. Purified GRK2 phosphorylated the WT m2 mAChR to a stoichiometry of 4.6 ± 0.7 mol of P/mol of R (TableI), while the m2-CAla4 and the m2-NAla4 were phosphorylated to 3.2 ± 0.5 and 3.4 ± 0.5 mol of P/mol of R, respectively (Table I). The extent of the in vitro phosphorylation of the m2-N,CAla8 receptor was significantly lower with a stoichiometry of 1.9 ± 0.3 mol of P/mol of R (TableI). These results reflect the previous results obtained in studies of phosphorylation in intact cells (4Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), but are not identical. Thus, both receptors with only one Ser/Thr cluster mutated to alanines were phosphorylated at multiple sites by GRK2; however, the stoichiometries were somewhat reduced compared with the WT m2 mAChR. In intact cells, the phosphorylation of the WT, and N- and C-cluster mutants exhibited similar extents of phosphorylation (4Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Similarly, while the in vitro phosphorylation of the double Ser/Thr cluster mutant was significantly lower than the WT receptors, this mutant was phosphorylated at two sites by GRK2 in vitro, while it exhibited no agonist-dependent phosphorylation in intact cells (4Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The results suggest that the in vitrophosphorylation assays may lead to phosphorylation at additional sites that are not phosphorylated in the environment of the intact cell. Alternatively, the GRK that is suspected to phosphorylate these receptors in HEK cells (5Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) may recognize the receptors somewhat differently than GRK2. In the next series of experiments, we compared the abilities of the WT m2 and the mutant mAChRs to bind to arrestin 2 and arrestin 3 in vitro. The purified receptors were phosphorylated with GRK2 or exposed to the same phosphorylation conditions in the absence of kinase as a control for receptor phosphorylation, and subsequently used in binding assays with [3H]arrestins as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In agreement with previous studies (14Gurevich V.V. Richardson R.M. Kim C.M. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16879-16882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), the WT m2 mAChR bound arrestin 2 (Fig.1 A) and arrestin 3 (Fig.1 B) in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Phosphorylation-dependent binding of arrestin 2 and arrestin 3 was also observed for the NAla4mutant mAChR (Fig. 1, A and B), and the extent of binding was virtually indistinguishable from that exhibited by the WT m2 mAChR. In marked contrast, the CAla4mutant was significantly impaired in its ability to bind both arrestins; the amount of phosphorylation-dependent arrestin binding to the CAla4 mutant was only 20–30% of that observed with either the WT or NAla4 mutant. The N,CAla8-m2 mAChR exhibited no phosphorylation-dependent binding of arrestins (Fig. 1,A and B). These results suggested that the structural requirements for phosphorylation-dependent arrestin binding include phosphorylation of the Ser/Thr residues found in aa 307–311 that are mutated in the CAla4 and N,CAla8 mutants. Of particular interest is the observation that the CAla4 mutant exhibits an internalization pattern closely resembling that of the WT m2 mAChR (4Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), while this mutant appears to be impaired in binding arrestins in vitro(Fig. 1). These observations raised the possibility that internalization of the m2 mAChR might occur through a phosphorylation-dependent, but arrestin-independent pathway. Interactions between the m2 mAChR and arrestins in intact cells have not yet been demonstrated. To test whether different arrestins could modulate internalization of the m2 mAChR, HEK-tsA201 cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding the m2 mAChR with or without cDNAs encoding arrestin 1 (visual arrestin), arrestin 2 (β-arrestin), or arrestin 3. Coexpression of the arrestin proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig.2 A) using a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against an epitope common to all known forms of arrestins (15Dua, H. S. (1992) Curr. Eye Res. , 11, (Suppl.), 107–111.Google Scholar). The levels of endogenous arrestins in the HEK-tsA201 cells were measured using purified arrestin 2 as a standard in immunoblotting analyses, and found to be approximately 50–100 fmol/mg of total cell protein for arrestin 3 and less for arrestin 2 (data not shown). In contrast, overexpression of arrestin 2 and/or arrestin 3 increased the levels of expression of each arrestin to approximately 15 pmol/mg of total cell protein in transiently transfected cells, as assessed by comparison to the immunoreactivity of a series of known amounts of purified arrestin 2. However, in a single transfected cell, the arrestins levels were even higher, as only 10–20% of the HEK cells become transfected using the standard calcium phosphate method. The agonist carbachol (1 mm) induced internalization of the m2 mAChR, as measured by loss of cell surface binding sites for the hydrophilic radioligand [3H]NMS (Fig. 2 B). This internalization plateaued after approximately 1 h of agonist exposure. Coexpression of arrestin 2 or arrestin 3, but not arrestin 1, increased the rate and extent of internalization of the WT m2 mAChR (Fig. 2 B). The effects of arrestin 2 and arrestin 3 were further investigated by comparing the dose-response curves for carbachol to induce m2 mAChR internalization in the presence and absence of overexpressed arrestins. Overexpression of arrestin 2 or arrestin 3 enhanced the extent of m2 mAChR internalization at 1 h at most concentrations of carbachol, while the EC50 for carbachol-induced internalization was not significantly changed (Fig. 2 C). Similar studies were performed with the Ser/Thr cluster mutant m2 mAChRs. We previously studied the rates of internalization of these mutants in stably or transiently transfected cells following exposure to high concentrations of carbachol, and found that the rate and extent of internalization of the m2-CAla4receptor in transiently transfected cells was identical to the WT m2 mAChR, while the m2-NAla4 receptor internalized at a slightly faster rate and to a slightly greater extent than the WT m2 mAChR (4Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the N,CAla8 receptor was significantly impaired in internalization in the transiently transfected cells (4Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To further analyze the properties of the mutant mAChRs, we measured the concentration response curves for carbachol to induce internalization of the WT and cluster mutant m2 mAChRs following 1 h of exposure to agonist. No statistically significant shifts in the EC50for carbachol were observed for the mutant m2 mAChRs (Table I). We next asked if overexpression of arrestin 2 or arrestin 3 could modify internalization of the mutant m2 mAChRs by incubating cells expressing the receptors ± arrestins with 1 mm carbachol for 1 h and measuring decreases in surface receptor levels. Internalization of the WT m2 mAChR following exposure to 1 mm carbachol increased from 23 ± 8% in control cells to 58 ± 6% and 65 ± 10% when arrestin 2 or arrestin 3 were overexpressed, respectively (Fig. 2 B). The internalization of the NAla4-m2 mAChR after 1 h of exposure to 1 mm carbachol was modestly, but significantly, increased under similar conditions from 44 ± 2% in control cells to 55 ± 2% or 57 ± 1%, with arrestin 2 or arrestin 3 overexpression, respectively (data not shown). Interestingly, the internalization of the CAla4 and the N,CAla8 mutants was not significantly increased by overexpression of either arrestin (data not shown). These results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the internalization of the mAChRs in HEK cells, by suggesting that internalization of the m2 mAChR occurs via an arrestin-independent pathway. Arrestin 2 and arrestin 3 are clathrin-binding proteins that act as adaptor molecules to link GPRs to clathrin-coated endocytotic vesicles (3Goodman O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V.

https://openalex.org/W2001926755,"The expression at the protein level of plasma membrane calcium pump (PMCA) isoforms in rat brain was detected by new antibodies that distinguished the four gene products and their alternatively spliced variants. All four gene products were distributed throughout hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum, but the alternate splices showed more distinct distribution patterns. The b splice of isoform 1 was not detectable in any of the brain regions, which makes it unlikely that this isoform performs an essential housekeeping role as is frequently proposed. The b splices of isoforms 3 and 4, although expressed in all three regions, showed evidence of proteolysis, which removed a portion of the carboxyl terminus. In contrast, isoform 2b retained its full length, indicating that PMCA2b is more resistant to proteolysis than the other b forms. Whereas substantial amounts of isoforms 1a, 2a, and 3a were expressed in all regions, 4a was found only in frontal cortex. The distinct patterns of expression of the PMCA isoforms in brain suggest that some of them play a special role in intracellular Ca regulation.

In contrast, isoform 2b retained its full length, indicating that PMCA2b is more resistant to proteolysis than the other b forms. Whereas substantial amounts of isoforms 1a, 2a, and 3a were expressed in all regions, 4a was found only in frontal cortex. The distinct patterns of expression of the PMCA isoforms in brain suggest that some of them play a special role in intracellular Ca regulation. The plasma membrane calcium pump is one of the mechanisms responsible for maintaining the low cytosolic calcium concentration critical to cell function. Because of its high affinity for calcium, it is believed to have a unique role in the maintenance of calcium homeostasis in eukaryotic cells. Sequencing and molecular cloning work have revealed some 20 isoforms of the pump, generated by four different genes encoding the pump and by the alternative splicing of the primary gene transcripts in two sites identified as A and C in the pump molecule. Studies on the distribution of mRNA of the pump in rat and human tissues revealed that gene products 1 and 4 are transcribed in all tissues, whereas gene products 2 and 3 were more tissue-specific and were found enriched in excitable cells. The transcription of the splicing variants was also found to be specific. In tissues where there is wide cell-type diversity, the distribution of the spliced variants has been found to be cell-specific. For example, in the pancreas, where secretion of insulin is dependent on calcium concentration, the beta cells express only isoform 4b, whereas alpha and gamma cells express both 4a and 4b. The islets do not express the a but only the b form of isoforms 1 and 2 (1Varadi A. Molnar E. Ashcroft S.J.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In brain, where highly regulated signal transduction events occur, the mRNAs of the spliced variants were also localized to specific cells and regions (2Zacharias D. Dalrymple S.J. Strehler E.E. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 28: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 3Stauffer T.P. Hilfiker H. Carafoli E. Strehler E.E. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 1994; 8: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The specific presence of the proteins of the a and b variants of the different isoforms is particularly interesting, since these variants are products of the alternate splicing at site C in the region where most of the regulatory properties of the pump are located (5Verma A.K. Enyedi A. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1687-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Verma A.K. Enyedi A. Filoteo A.G. Strehler E.E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 8952-8956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) show that these proteins have different affinities for calcium and calmodulin. The protein products of the four genes encoding the pump have been identified and have confirmed the reported distribution of the mRNA (9Stauffer T.P. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12184-12190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 10Eakin T.J. Antonelli M.C. Malchiodi E.L. Baskin D.G. Stahl W.L. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 29: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, information on the presence of the alternatively spliced variants at the protein level is still very limited. In this paper we present our work on the production of highly sensitive variant-specific polyclonal antibodies that recognize the alternatively spliced variants (called a and b) of the different isoforms of the plasma membrane calcium pump. We report the raising of these antibodies, the determination of their specificities, and their use to localize the alternatively spliced variants in the cerebellum, frontal cortex, and hippocampal region of rat brain. We have also shown that the use of these antibodies can provide information on proteolysis. Our evidence indicates that specific proteolysis of isoforms 3b and 4b removes a portion of the carboxyl terminus, leaving only 2b with a full-length carboxyl terminus. The antibodies were generated by immunizing New Zealand rabbits with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthetic peptides. The production of the antibodies was done using our peptides by Cocalico Biologicals, Reamstown, Pa. The peptides were synthesized using t-butoxycarbonyl-l-amino acids onp-methylbenzhydrylamine resin following the methods described previously (11McCormick D.J. Griesmann G.E. Huang Z. Lambert E.H. Lennon V.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 2615-2619PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of the peptides are shown in Fig. 1. Each sequence was chosen because of its uniqueness to the particular isoform for which the antibody was being designed. The sequences were from 13 to 18 residues long. Sequences in the region close to the amino terminus of PMCA 1The abbreviations used are: PMCA, plasma membrane calcium pump; r, rat; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; h, human. isoforms 1, 2, and 3 were chosen to make antibodies against both rat and human plasma membrane calcium pump, whereas sequences from the carboxyl-terminal region were selected to make antibodies against the alternatively spliced variants of the different rat isoforms. Antibodies against the a (unspliced) variant of all four main rat isoforms and against the b (spliced) variant of rPMCA3 were successfully raised. The production of antibody against rPMCA4b was unsuccessful after several trials using different peptides. An antibody against the b form of rat isoforms 1, 2, and 3, however, was generated using a highly conserved (100% homology) region in the carboxyl-terminal domain of the isoforms. Sera from test bleeds were screened for antibody by Western blot analysis using a 1:200 dilution of the serum. Blots containing expressed rat calcium pumps PMCA2a, PMCA2b, PMCA3a, PMCA3b, and the endogenous calcium pump (PMCA1b) in COS 1 cells were used to screen for specific antibodies. In cases where no expressed calcium pumps were available to use for antibody screening, microsomal preparations from rat brain (that was reported to contain the mRNA for almost all of the isoforms) were used. The methods followed were as described previously (12Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The amount of sample protein applied to each track of the gel ranged from 0.5 to 2 μg for microsomes containing expressed pump and was 0.5 μg for the rat brain preparations. To determine the specificity of the antibodies, mixtures of different expressed pump isoforms were used in Western blots to serve both as positive and negative controls. This method not only screened for the antibodies, but at the same time also tested for the absence of cross-reactivity of the antibody with the other isoforms of the calcium pump. The isoform-specific antibodies correctly stained only the appropriate expressed isoforms,i.e. rPMCA2b and rPMCA2a were both detected by antibody NR2, whereas rPMCA2a was detected only by antibody CR2A. Both NR2 and CR2A did not recognize the endogenous calcium pump PMCA1b in COS 1 cells. Peptide competition studies were also conducted as another control to rule out nonspecific reactions. Identical transblots of the calcium pump were incubated in antibody solution in the presence or absence of a 20 μm concentration of the corresponding peptide. The identical blots were processed at the same time to avoid artifacts that may be introduced during the analysis. The sensitivities of the antibodies were analyzed by Western blot and by ELISA. Identical blots containing the same amounts of the calcium pump (taking into consideration the level of expression) were stained with the different polyclonal antibodies and with the monoclonal antibody 5F10 (12Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The intensities of the staining of the bands shown by the polyclonal antibodies were compared with the intensities of the stains obtained with the monoclonal antibody 5F10. 5F10 was an excellent antibody to use as a standard since not only does it recognize all isoforms of the pump, but it also has a very high affinity for them. The blots were digitally scanned using Sigma Scan/Image Software. The ELISA used was as described previously (12Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Titration of the antibodies was performed using 0.1 μg per well of the corresponding peptide conjugated to bovine serum albumin. Rat brains were quickly removed from rats sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The frontal cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus were immediately excised and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. They were kept under liquid nitrogen until crude membrane fractions were prepared. The microsomes were made by the method previously described (12Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) with the following modification: 2 μg/ml leupeptin and 4 μg/ml aprotinin were added to all solutions. The protein concentration of the fractions was determined using the method of Lowry et al. using bovine serum albumin as standard (13Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In naming the different isoforms of the pump we use names such as rPMCA1a, where the letter r refers to the rat species, PMCA stands for plasma membrane calcium pump, the number 1 refers to the product of the first gene, and the last letter refers to the alternate splicing. The first letter “r” may be dropped in this text when the discussion involves only the pump within the rat species, and the PMCA is also frequently dropped, since our discussion only involves the plasma membrane calcium pump. Fig. 1 lists the antibodies and the sequence of the peptides that were used for generating the antibodies. The antibodies are named such that the first letter refers to the region of the molecule where the epitope is located (N or C to indicate the amino or carboxyl terminus). The letter R and the numbers 1–4 stand for the isoform corresponding to the four genes in rat. The last letter in the designation such as A or B indicates the spliced variant of the particular isoform. Thus, CR1A would recognize rPMCA1a at the carboxyl terminus. No last letter is used in the name of antibodies NR1, NR2, and NR3, which have the epitope at the amino terminus; these antibodies are expected to recognize all spliced variants of their isoforms. The antibodies raised against the amino-terminal sequences would recognize both human and rat PMCAs, whereas most of the antibodies against the carboxyl terminus would recognize only the rat species. We have also listed in Fig. 1 a monoclonal antibody called JA9 which we have used to recognize rPMCA4. This antibody had been raised previously in our laboratory against a purified PMCA preparation from human erythrocyte that contains mostly hPMCA4. Characterization of the antibody showed that it was specific for isoform 4 and that the epitope was at the amino terminus, which is highly homologous to the corresponding region in rat PMCA4 (12Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recent data (not shown) demonstrates that JA9 does not react with rat isoforms 1, 2, or 3. Following the naming of the antibodies adopted above, in this paper we will refer to this antibody as JA9(NR4). Fig. 2 shows the sequence differences of the region used for antibody production. As can be seen on this figure, the sequences of these regions (boxed) are unique for each isoform; therefore the antibodies raised against the peptides are expected to be highly isoform specific. Table I shows the molecular masses of the isoforms studied here. Since we have succeeded in separating them electrophoretically, this is an important means of identifying the isoforms and of observing proteolytic modification. At the level of resolution achievable by electrophoresis, there are no significant differences between the molecular masses of the corresponding rat and human isoforms (i.e. rPMCA1b and hPMCA1b are indistinguishable, but they migrate more slowly than all of the other isoforms).Table ISize of PMCA isozymesMolecular massr1a129,509r1b134,715r2az127,328r2bz132,614r3a127,295r3b132,882r4a128,919h4a129,304r4b133,093h4b133,929 Open table in a new tab We have been very successful in raising isoform-specific antibodies of PMCA against these peptides. We have obtained 9 useful antibodies out of 12 attempts. The evidence for the specificity of the antibodies comes from several sources. 1) They react with the appropriate PMCA isoforms overexpressed in COS cells and fail to react with inappropriate isoforms. 2) They react with narrow bands in rat brain microsomes, which contain a mixture of almost all PMCA isoforms. In most cases, these bands have the expected molecular mass, which confirms their identity. Our ability to separate PMCA isoforms of slightly different molecular masses greatly increases the reliability of their identification. 3) They were raised against isoform-specific peptides and interact with those peptides. The specificities of antibodies NR1, NR2, NR3, CR3A, CRXB, and CR3B were determined using mixtures of COS cell microsomes containing overexpressed PMCAs whose identity was accurately known. In addition to the overexpressed PMCA, the COS cell microsomes contained naturally occurring PMCA1b, which served as an additional standard. We had no overexpressed PMCA available for antibodies CR1A, CR2A, and CR4A, so their specificities were determined by using rat brain microsomes, which contain nearly all of the isoforms. The results are summarized in Fig. 3, which is discussed in the following paragraphs. 5F10, a monoclonal antibody that is known to recognize all pump isoforms, stained all bands in each of the mixtures of COS cell microsomes, as expected. Antibody NR1 did not stain isoforms 2, 3, or 4 but only the slowest migrating band, which was the endogenous pump of COS cells. Since this slowest migrating band had the size expected for isoform 1b and was also recognized by antibody CRXB, the endogenous pump of COS cells must be PMCA1b. Antibodies NR2 and NR3 stained only the bands appropriate to their expected specificity and did not stain any other bands. The antibody CRXB stained isoforms 1b and 2b but not 3a, 4a, or 4b; this was consistent with its expected specificity for 1b, 2b, and 3b. CR3A recognized only rPMCA3a and did not give a positive reaction with either PMCA1b and rPMCA3b, whereas CR3B stained only expressed isoform rPMCA3b and not PMCA1b and rPMCA3a. Thus, all of these antibodies had the expected and desired specificities. As mentioned above, the specificities of CR1A, CR2A, and CR4A were determined by using rat brain microsomes. Each of these antibodies was able to select a single narrow band of the expected molecular mass out of the broad spectrum of PMCA bands recognized in brain by 5F10. The isoform specificity of these antibodies was further substantiated by the absence of cross-reactivity with the mixtures of over-expressed PMCAs expressed in COS cell microsomes. Since no other band than the one with the appropriate size could be seen, these antibodies were considered to be specific. The identity of the bands recognized by antibodies CR1A, CR2A, and CR4A were further confirmed by use of the corresponding antibodies whose epitopes lie at the amino terminus. NR1 detected a single band migrating in the position of the CR1A band, indicating that the CR1A band is a product of gene 1. NR2 detected two bands, indicating the presence of the two isoforms from gene 2. The faster migrating band, as expected, co-migrated with the band detected by CR2A, verifying that CR2A band is a product of gene 2. The slower migrating band was in the position expected for rPMCA2b. JA9(NR4) confirmed the band detected by CR4A. It stained a band co-migrating with the band recognized by CR4A. The band recognized by JA9(NR4) appears wider than that recognized by CR4A. As discussed later in the paper, this was accounted for by the presence of a modified rPMCA4b. The specificities of the antibodies were also examined in a peptide competition experiment. The blots of PMCA isoforms were incubated in the absence or presence of peptide in the corresponding antibody solution. The results showed that blots that were incubated with the antibody in the presence or absence of the corresponding peptide showed staining only in the absence of the peptide (data not shown). This experiment also indicated that the antibodies were highly specific. The sensitivity of the antibodies was determined by Western blot analysis and by ELISA. The results of the Western blot analyses are summarized in TableII. The intensity of staining of each band by its antibody was compared with the intensity of staining produced by 5F10. 5F10 was used as standard, since it is a very strong, high affinity antibody whose epitope is present in all isoforms of the pump. The relative intensities of the antibodies are shown in Table II. Five of the antibodies were approximately as sensitive as 5F10 (79% or better), whereas another three antibodies had lesser, but still good, sensitivity. Only CRXB was much less sensitive than 5F10, but even this antibody still produced useful Western blots. An experiment using ELISA showed similar results (data not shown). The sensitivity of these antibodies also appeared to be much higher than the sensitivity of the antibodies reported by Stauffer et al. (9Stauffer T.P. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12184-12190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The amount of rat brain preparation they used to detect the isoforms was 120 times higher than was needed for the experiments reported here.Table IISensitivity of the antibodiesAntibodyRatio (Antibody, 5F10)NR10.53NR20.79NR31.05CR1A1.06CR2A0.86CR3A0.50CR3B0.92CR4A0.56CRXB0.14 Open table in a new tab This is the first report on the detection of the spliced variants of the different isoforms at the protein level. Brain was chosen for study because it contains most of the PMCA isoforms in abundance and because of the wide interest in this tissue. Table IIIsummarizes the isoforms found in the three different regions of rat brain, cerebellum, frontal cortex, and hippocampus. Table III was generated from immunoanalysis of samples by Western blots in which the results using isoform-specific antibodies were standardized against those obtained with monoclonal antibody 5F10.Table IIIComparison of the levels of alternatively spliced PMCA isoforms among the different regions of rat brainCerebellumFrontal cortexHippocampusPMCA 1a++++++1b???1c0001d000PMCA 2a+++++++2b++++++PMCA 3a+++++++3b+++++++PMCA 4a0+04b+++++This table compares the amount of a particular isoform among the regions of the brain tested.

Fig. 4 shows immunoblots of the three different regions of rat brain using all of the pertinent antibodies. The staining with 5F10 showed broad bands for all of the regions, and each region's band had a somewhat different shape. Using the more specific antibodies, we were able to show that these different shapes were due to a unique pattern of isoform distribution in each region. Interestingly, no staining with antibody 5F10 could be seen at the position of PMCA1b. Indeed, NR1 and CRXB also showed nothing in this position, although some cases showed a faint and erratically appearing band. This indicated that very low amounts of PMCA1b are present in any of the brain regions investigated. Staining with antibody CR1A showed the presence of a small amount of rPMCA1a; NR1 confirmed the presence of rPMCA1a but showed no band in the position of rPMCA1b, indicating that only insignificant amounts of 1b were expressed in cerebellum. Staining with antibody NR2 showed the presence of 2a and 2b in cerebellum, with both isoforms migrating in their expected positions. Antibody CR2A confirmed that the more rapidly migrating band represented 2a and not proteolyzed 2b. Staining with NR3 showed only one band migrating in the position of 3a, and a band in this position was also detected by CR3A. A careful examination of the immunoblots incubated with antibody CR3B showed the presence of two closely migrating bands. The upper, faint band migrated in the position of the standard isoform 3b, whereas the strong band migrated at a position indicating a smaller molecular mass. The strong band migrated very close to the position of isoform 3a, so that it appears as a single band in the blot incubated with antibody NR3. The bands detected by CR3B indicate that 3b was translated, but that most of it was proteolyzed at the carboxyl terminus. Truncation at the amino terminus could not have occurred, since the modified 3b is still detected by antibody NR3, whose epitope begins only 4 residues away from the amino terminus. The epitope for antibody CR3B is about 60 residues away from the carboxyl terminus, so CR3B can very easily detect a proteolyzed form of 3b with a molecular size equivalent to 3a. Examination of the amino acid sequence of 3b in that region showed two arginine residues at positions 1203 and 1205; rPMCA3a ends at position 1206. The immunoanalysis using CR4A and JA9(NR4) showed the presence of 4b and the absence of 4a in cerebellum. Antibody JA9, which recognizes both a and b variants of isoform 4 showed only a single band. CR4A showed no band, indicating that the band recognized by JA9 must be 4b. Like 3b, it migrated faster than expected, indicating that this protein has also been proteolyzed. This phenomenon of proteolysis of PMCA4b has also been observed in human brain (12Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The frontal cortex showed with 5F10 one broad band with an apparent molecular mass range of 127,295 to >132,614 kDa, suggesting that more isoforms were present than in cerebellum. Immunoanalysis using the isoform-specific antibodies confirmed that cortex expressed an additional isoform and that the isoforms it had in common with the other brain regions were more abundant in cortex. The additional isoform found in cortex was rPMCA4a, whose presence was disclosed by staining with CR4A. Because of the presence of 4a and the absence of a specific antibody for rat 4b, it was difficult to verify the presence of 4b in cortex. However, the band shown by JA9 was more intense and broader than that seen by CR4A. These facts indicated that cortex contained a modified form of 4b, like the other brain regions. The hippocampal region similarly presented a broad band with 5F10 with the same apparent molecular mass range as cortex, but the staining was more concentrated in the position where the b variants of isoforms 2, 3, and 4 migrate. Analysis of the blots with the specific antibodies suggested the presence of higher levels of 4b and 3b in this region. Comparison of the staining by antibodies CR3B, CR3A, and NR3 indicated that the strong band detected by NR3 contained a substantial portion of truncated 3b and that this protein was migrating at almost the same rate as 3a. As was the case for cerebellum, hippocampus contained no detectable 4a, and it had only the modified, rapidly migrating form of 4b. The distribution of the messages for the different plasma membrane calcium pump isoforms in cells and tissues has been well documented; several studies have shown that the expression of the PMCA isoforms exhibits a great deal of diversity. We have raised isoform-specific antibodies to study this distribution at the protein level. Although there are no strong arguments that the mRNAs will not be translated, direct evidence is lacking. We have chosen to prepare antibodies against the splicing variants generated at the C site, since this region contains the regulatory structures of the pump. Physiologically, this region can be very significant, especially since the splicing options in the different isoforms not only change the affinities for calcium and calmodulin but also can change the structure to present unique sites for phosphorylation. In isoform 1, splicing removes the proposed site for protein kinase A phosphorylation. The protein kinase C phosphorylation site in hPMCA4b is also located in the carboxyl terminus (14Enyedi A.

Conigrave A.D. Roufogalis B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9078-9085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the sites that are sensitive to enzymatic proteolysis appear to lie in this region. We have chosen to work on brain tissues because of the wide interest in this area and the abundance of messages for the pump. Except for CRXB, the antibodies we raised were of very high specificity and of comparable sensitivity to 5F10. This allowed the use of very small amounts of membranes for the analyses. Isoform 1 was found to be most abundant in the frontal cortex, followed by hippocampus and cerebellum as shown by the blots stained with antibody NR1. In situ hybridization studies by Stahl et al. (18Stahl W.L. Eakin T.J. Owens Jr., J.W.M. Breininger J.F. Filuk P.E. Anderson W.R. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 16: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) also showed the same pattern but detected very low levels of this isoform in cerebellum. CR1A detected variant 1a in all the regions and also showed the same distribution of intensities as detected by NR1. This indicates that the relative distribution of isoform 1 among these regions is influenced mainly by the presence of the a variant. A faint band in the position expected for isoform 1b sometimes appeared, particularly in frontal cortex, as is shown in the Fig. 4 blots using antibodies NR1 and CRXB. Otherwise, isoform 1b appeared to be low or nonexistent. This was rather surprising, since this isoform has been believed to have housekeeping functions. Numerous studies showed that the message for this variant was constitutively expressed in abundance in many mammalian tissues, supporting such a role for this isoform (3Stauffer T.P. Hilfiker H. Carafoli E. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25993-26003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hammes A. Oberdorf S. Strehler E.E. Stauffer T. Carafoli E. Vetter H. Neyses L.

The low level of 1b we detected in adult rat brain, however, agrees with the findings of Brandt and Neve (17Brandt P. Neve R.L. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1566-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). They studied polymerase chain reaction amplification products from PMCA mRNAs in developing brain and found that the mRNA for 1b was reduced as the brain developed. Interestingly, they also discovered that with decrease in 1b expression, there was increase in the expression of the a variant of isoform 1. They suggested that 1a is the synaptic form of the enzyme and was being expressed as synaptic maturation progressed. Our results showing the low level of 1b compared with 1a with the use of isoform-specific antibodies compare favorably with the levels of mRNA detected by polymerase chain reaction amplification techniques, and they may be the first direct evidence, at the protein level, of regulation of the calcium pump using the alternate splicing options. In view of the proteolysis demonstrated for isoforms 3b and 4b, it is possible that a similar degradation might be occurring to 1b. Two arguments may be made against this possibility. 1) CR1A showed strong bands with the same distribution in intensities among the brain regions as NR1 in many different blots, indicating that 1a accounts for all of the staining seen in the 1a position. 2) The low levels of 1b are consistent with the most complete polymerase chain reaction study on brain development (17Brandt P. Neve R.L. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1566-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses using antibodies NR2 and CR2A showed that the amount of 2a was nearly equal to the amount of 2b in all regions. No notable increase in either variant of isoform 2 was detected in cerebellum, which was reported to have an abundance of this isoform in Purkinje cells (18Stahl W.L. Eakin T.J. Owens Jr., J.W.M. Breininger J.F. Filuk P.E. Anderson W.R. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 16: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Our results average the contribution of PMCA2 from all of the cell types in the cerebellum, and the contribution of the Purkinje cells to this result is probably diluted. Such dilution probably accounts for our failure to see any increase in PMCA2 in cerebellum. Our results clearly show that the proteolytic modification seen in isoforms 3 and 4 does not occur with isoform 2. Blots using NR3 gave only a single band, migrating in the position expected for 3a. Taken by itself, this might appear to indicate that 3b, like 1b, was absent. However, antibodies CRXB and CR3B disclosed that 3b was migrating faster than expected, so that its band coincided with that of 3a. Only a small fraction of 3b was found to migrate in the appropriate position. The fact that the apparent molecular mass of this fast moving 3b approaches that of 3a in all the three regions indicates that proteolysis or some other post-translational modification has occurred. Isoform 4 was abundant in frontal cortex, with less present in hippocampus and cerebellum. Isoform 4a was detected only in frontal cortex, suggesting a unique demand for this isoform in this region. Isoform 4b was detected in all three regions and in all cases was found to be smaller in mass than the calculated molecular size. Like 3b, 4b approached the size of 4a, and the full-length 4b molecule contains putative sites for proteolysis that can produce a truncated protein of such size. That this proteolysis is observed in both 3b and 4b suggests that natural or programmed proteolysis is regulating some aspect of the pump's function in brain. The altered migration rates of these two isoforms indicate that they have been modified in all of the brain regions tested, whereas a corresponding modification has not occurred to isoform 2b. This modification is almost certainly a proteolytic cleavage, since other probable modifications would not cause such a change in migration rate in the presence of SDS. Extensive glycation or glycosylation of the protein does not cause a substantial shift in its migration rate (19Flecha F.L.G. Castello P.R. Caride A.J. Gagliardino J.J. Rossi J.P.F.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and any lesser modifications would also be unlikely to affect the migration of so large a molecule. Such a cleavage must occur at the carboxyl terminus of the molecule, since, as discussed above, the antibodies raised against amino-terminal sequences are directed toward epitopes very near to the end of the molecule. The migration rates of the proteolyzed 3b and 4b proteins indicate that about 40 to 50 residues have been removed; they migrate at the same position as the truncated mutant ct48, which was made by removing 48 carboxyl-terminal residues from hPMCA4b. Studies of the enzymatic properties of ct48 show that they are indistinguishable from those of the full-length molecule (14Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32461-32467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The regions of the molecule that influence activity are upstream of the region in question here. This indicates that we must consider some other aspect of biological function to account for the significance of the modification observed here. We have presented in this paper evidence at the protein level that supports the notion that alternate splicing is a viable tool for regulation of the plasma membrane calcium pump in vivo. Our laboratory has characterized and defined the affinities for calmodulin and calcium of the splicing variants (at site C) that have been overexpressed in COS cells. We have also identified the autoinhibitory regions involved in the carboxyl terminus of the different isoforms. With the use of the highly sensitive variant-specific antibodies produced in our laboratory, we have now confirmed that these options are being utilized."

We have studied its chaperone-like activity toward the aggregation of βL-crystallin upon refolding of this protein from its unfolded state in guanidinium chloride. The chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin is less pronounced below 30 °C and is enhanced above this temperature. The plot of percentage protection as a function of temperature shows two transitions; one at 30 °C and another at around 55 °C. We have performed steady state fluorescence, fluorescence polarization, fluorescence quenching, circular dichroism, sedimentation analysis, and gel filtration chromatography to probe the temperature-induced structural changes of α-crystallin. Our results show that at above 50 °C, α-crystallin undergoes a transition to a multimeric molten globule-like state. Above 30 °C, a minor but detectable perturbation in its tertiary structure occurs that might lead to the observed exposure of its hydrophobic surfaces. These results support our earlier hypothesis that α-crystallin prevents the aggregation of other proteins by providing appropriately placed hydrophobic surfaces; a structural transition above 30 °C involving enhanced or reorganized hydrophobic surfaces of α-crystallin is important for its chaperone-like activity. It is possible that a structural alteration induced by temperature forms a part of the general mechanism of chaperone function, because they are required to function more effectively at nonpermissible temperatures. α-Crystallin is known to exhibit chaperone-like activity.

It is also expressed in other tissues such as heart, kidney, brain, muscles, etc. (1Bhat S.P. Nagineni C.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

It was believed to play only a structural role in the formation of the transparent and highly refractive tissue of the eye lens. However, the discovery of its presence in non-lenticular tissues and its homology with small heat shock proteins suggests that it might have other functional properties. α-Crystallin is shown to prevent the heat-induced aggregation of other crystallins and enzymes like a molecular chaperone (14Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). The chaperone-like property of this crystallin has been investigated by several workers in order to gain insight in both the mechanism of this property and its relevance to the eye lens transparency (15Rao C.M.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18844-18849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are found to exhibit decreased chaperone-like activity. The chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin might be important in the formation and maintenance of the eye lens transparency, and the loss of transparency can be attributed to the loss of function of α-crystallin (17Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier we investigated the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin toward the photo-induced aggregation of γ-crystallin (17Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), aggregation of insulin (18Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and on the refolding of β- and γ-crystallins (19Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19888-19892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We observed that α-crystallin can prevent photo-aggregation of γ-crystallin, and this chaperone-like activity of α-crystalline is enhanced severalfold at temperatures above 30 °C. This enhancement parallels the exposure of its hydrophobic surfaces as a function of temperature, probed using hydrophobic fluorescent probes such as pyrene (17Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate (18Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We therefore concluded that α-crystallin prevents the aggregation of other proteins by providing properly placed hydrophobic surfaces; a structural transition above 30 °C might therefore be important for its chaperone-like property (17Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Maiti et al. (31Maiti M. Kono M. Chakrabarti B. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) studied the secondary structure of α-crystallin by far UV-circular dichroism and reported that α-crystallin is heat stable and does not denature at temperatures up to 100 °C. Surewicz and Olesen (32Surewicz W.K. Olesen P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9655-9660Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) observe that α-crystallin undergoes a major thermotropic transition with a midpoint at 60–62 °C, which appears to correspond to the transition observed by Walsh et al. (33Walsh M.T. Sen A.C. Chakrabarti B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20079-20084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and our own observation (18Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The details of the structural alterations in terms of secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of α-crystallin as a function of temperature, however, are not yet understood. The commonly used model system, thermal aggregation of βL-crystallin does not allow variable temperature studies. Hence we have used refolding-induced aggregation of βL-crystallin and also investigated the structural aspects of α-crystallin in the context of its chaperone-like activity. Sephacryl S-300 (high resolution), Bio-Gel A-1.5 m, and Bio-Gel A-5 m were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. GdmCl 1The abbreviations used are: GdmCl, guanidinium chloride; CD, circular dichroism. was procured from Serva. All other chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade. α- and βL-crystallins were isolated and purified as described in our earlier studies (15Rao C.M. Zigler J.S. Raman B. Investig.

Refolding of βL-crystallin was performed at the final protein concentration of 0.133 mg/ml by 50-fold dilution of the stock of unfolded protein into the refolding buffer. The refolding buffer was 30 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl. The refolding experiment was performed at different temperatures by preequilibrating the refolding buffer with and without α-crystallin (0.65 mg/ml) at the required temperature for 5 min. The sample was kept at the same temperature for 5 min before the measurement of the turbidity of the sample. The turbidity was measured as optical density at 500 nm. Fluorescence measurements were performed using a Hitachi F4010 fluorescence spectrophotometer. For fluorescence studies, a 0.2 mg/ml sample of α-crystallin in 30 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl was used. Fluorescence studies at different temperatures were performed by placing the samples in the cuvette holder, which was thermostated at the required temperatures using a Julabo circulating water bath. The actual temperature inside the cuvette was monitored using the Physitemp type-T microthermocouple thermometer. Fluorescence spectra were recorded with the excitation wavelength set at 295 nm. The excitation and emission band passes were set at 5 and 1.5 nm, respectively. All spectra were recorded in corrected spectrum mode. Fluorescence polarization measurements were performed using Hitachi fluorescence polarization accessory. The sample was excited at 295 nm, and the emission intensity was monitored at 340 nm. Polarization values were calculated as P = (I VV −GI VH)/(I VV +GI VH) where I VV andI VH are the measured fluorescence intensities with the excitation and emission polarizers oriented vertically or the excitation and the emission polarizers oriented vertically and horizontally, respectively. G is a correction factor and is equal to I HV/I HH. Fluorescence quenching experiments were performed using the neutral quencher, acrylamide. The sample was excited at 295 nm. The emission intensity at 340 nm was measured with successive additions of 7 μl of 7 m acrylamide to 1.2 ml of 0.2 mg/ml α-crystallin in 30 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl. The total volume of the acrylamide added was not more than 9% of the sample volume. The fluorescence intensities were corrected for the dilution. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. CD spectra of α-crystallin at different temperatures were recorded using water-jacketed cuvettes. The required temperatures were maintained using a Julabo circulating water bath. The actual temperature inside the cuvette was measured using the Physitemp type T microthermocouple thermometer. A 1 mg/ml sample of α-crystallin in 30 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl was used. Far UV-CD spectra and near UV-CD spectra were recorded using 0.01-cm and 1-cm path length cuvettes, respectively. The spectra shown in the present study were the cumulative average of at least four repeat scans. Gel filtration chromatography of α-crystallin was performed at different temperatures using a Sephacryl S-300 (high resolution) water-jacketed column (0.9 × 70 cm) equilibrated at the required temperature using the Julabo water circulating water bath. 0.3 ml of 2.1 mg/ml α-crystallin solution was loaded onto the column equilibrated with 30 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl and eluted with the same buffer. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and absorbance at 280 nm was measured. Elution profile of blue dextran (molecular mass, 2000 kDa) on the column was obtained to measure the void volume. Sedimentation velocity measurements were carried out with native and temperature-modified α-crystallin solutions (4 mg/ml) using a Spinco E analytical ultracentrifuge fitted with a phase plate and rotor temperature indicator and control unit. Runs were performed at 60,000 rpm at an average temperature of 25 ± 0.5 °C.s 20, w values were obtained by applying appropriate corrections for temperature and solvent viscosity. α-Crystallin is known to prevent aggregation of proteins like a molecular chaperone. The molecular mechanism of this chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin is not yet completely understood. We have investigated the aggregation of βL-crystallin upon refolding from its GdmCl-unfolded state and the effect of α-crystallin on this aggregation. Fig.1 A shows the aggregation of βL-crystallin upon refolding at 0.133 mg/ml from its unfolded state (in 6.5 m GdmCl) by 50-fold dilution into the refolding buffer at various temperatures. As seen from the figure, the extent of aggregation of βL-crystallin gradually increases with refolding temperature in the absence of α-crystallin. The aggregation of βL-crystallin is relatively less in the presence of α-crystallin, but the aggregation profile with refolding temperature is parallel to that containing no α-crystallin until 30 °C. Interestingly, above 30 °C, the extent of aggregation is remarkably reduced in the presence of α-crystallin. Fig. 1 B shows the percentage protection that the α-crystallin offers to βL-crystallin as a function of refolding temperature. It is evident from the figure that the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin is enhanced above 30 °C, with two distinct transitions, one at 30 °C and the another above 55 °C. We showed earlier that the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin toward the photo-aggregation of γ-crystallin (17Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and dithiothreitol-induced aggregation of insulin (18Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) is more pronounced at temperatures above 30 °C. Differential scanning calorimetric studies on α-crystallin by Walsh et al. (33Walsh M.T. Sen A.C. Chakrabarti B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20079-20084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed two endothermic transitions, a relatively minor one at 35–45 °C and another major transition at around 60 °C. On probing the hydrophobic surfaces of α-crystallin using the hydrophobic fluorescent probe, pyrene, we showed that the hydrophobic surfaces of α-crystallin are exposed above 30 °C, with two distinct transitions, one at ∼30 °C and the another at ∼55 °C (17Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We obtained similar results with another probe, 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate (18Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Das and Surewicz (21Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) also reported similar temperature-induced exposure of hydrophobic surfaces of α-crystallin using bis-8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate. Smith et al. (30Smith J.B. Liu Y. Smith D.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) used hydrogen-deuterium exchange of amide proton to study the conformational aspects of α-crystallin as a function of temperature. Their observation supports our hypothesis that α-crystallin prevents the aggregation of non-native structures of target proteins by providing appropriately placed hydrophobic surfaces (17Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and extended it further by suggesting the regions of α-crystallin that may become exposed with temperature (30Smith J.B. Liu Y. Smith D.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). They observed that the hydrophobic regions around the residues 32–37 and 72–75 of αA and 28–34 of αB become solvent-exposed above 30 °C. Our earlier studies (15Rao C.M. Zigler J.S. Raman B. Investig. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1993; 34: 988Google Scholar, 16Rao C.M. Raman B Investig. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1994; 35: 1905Google Scholar, 17Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) as well as the present study (Fig. 1) clearly show a temperature-dependent chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin. It is, therefore, important to study in detail the temperature-induced conformational changes of α-crystallin in the context of its chaperone-like activity. Fig. 2 A shows the far UV-CD spectra of α-crystallin at different temperatures. Fig. 2 Bshows the change in the mean residual ellipticity at 205 and 222 nm as a function of temperature. It is evident from the figure that the ellipticity value at 205 or 222 nm is not significantly altered at temperatures <50 °C. Above 50 °C, the ellipticity at 205 nm increases sharply, whereas the ellipticity at 222 nm increases only marginally. This result is consistent with the earlier report of Maitiet al. (31Maiti M. Kono M. Chakrabarti B. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and Surewicz and Olesen (32Surewicz W.K. Olesen P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9655-9660Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, it is to be noted that the far UV-CD spectra of α-crystallin above 50 °C do not indicate a random coil structure but indicate an alteration in the native structure. As mentioned earlier, most of the earlier studies have been focused on the secondary structure of α-crystallin at different temperatures. However, the tertiary structure of α-crystallin as a function of temperature, to the best of our knowledge, has not been studied. Since higher order structures appear to have a major role in the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin, we studied the tertiary structure of α-crystallin and its alteration with temperature using fluorescence and near UV-circular dichroism. We observed that the fluorescence emission maximum of α-crystallin is shifted from 335 nm at 20 °C to 338 nm at 62 °C. This indicates that the tryptophan residues of α-crystallin are relatively more exposed to the solvent at 62 °C. It does not indicate complete exposure of tryptophan residues as in the cases of complete unfolding of proteins. We also studied the variation of the microenvironment of tryptophan residues of α-crystallin by monitoring the accessibility of tryptophan residues to the neutral fluorescence quencher, acrylamide. Fig.3 A shows the Stern-Volmer plot of the quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of α-crystallin when excited at 295 nm as a function of temperature. Fig. 3 Bshows the variation of F 0/F value (which is indicative of the extent of quenching) at the quencher concentration of 0.45 m as a function of temperature. This value starts increasing gradually above 30 °C and more sharply above 50 °C. This indicates that the tryptophan residues of α-crystallin are becoming more accessible to the quencher at temperatures above 30 °C. On the other hand, hen egg white lysozyme, a protein that is known to be stable up to temperatures as high as 75 °C (34Shih P. Holland D.R. Kirsch J.F. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2050-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), does not show such an increase in the accessibility of its tryptophan residues to the quencher with temperature as shown in Fig.3 B, suggesting that the quenching behavior seen in the case of α-crystallin is due to specific structural perturbation. Fig.4 shows the variation of polarization of the intrinsic fluorescence of α-crystallin at 340 nm as a function of temperature. As seen from the figure, the polarization value decreases more significantly above 30 °C. This suggests that the restriction in the mobility of the tryptophans of α-crystallin due to the microenvironment (side chain packing) is significantly reduced at higher temperatures.Figure 4Polarization of the tryptophan fluorescence (Fl.) of α-crystallin at various temperatures (see “Experimental Procedures” for details).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 5 A shows the near UV-CD spectra of α-crystallin at various temperatures. The variation of the mean residual mass ellipticity at 272.5 nm with temperature is shown in Fig. 5 B. The ellipticity value at 272.5 nm decreases gradually till about 50 °C and falls steeply to about zero by 62 °C. This result shows that at 62 °C, α-crystallin lacks any rigid tertiary structural packing. This result is consistent with the observed decrease in fluorescence polarization and the increased accessibility of tryptophan residues of α-crystallin to the quencher at higher temperatures. Thus, all our fluorescence and near UV-CD studies show that α-crystallin loses its tertiary structure with temperature, and the loss is more pronounced at temperatures above 50 °C. As mentioned above, α-crystallin undergoes gradual tertiary structural alterations up to 50 °C and loses almost all its tertiary structure above this temperature. However, the secondary structure of α-crystallin does not seem to be altered significantly up to approximately 50 °C but is altered above this temperature. Since α-crystallin is a multimeric protein, it would be important to find out whether the quaternary structure is perturbed with temperature. The quaternary structure of α-crystallin, however, is not completely understood. There have been several models proposed for the quaternary structure of α-crystallin, a three-layered structure (35Tardieu A. Laporte D. Licinio P. Krop B. Delaye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 36Siezen R.J. Bindels J.G. Hoenders H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), a micelle-like structure (37Augusteyn R.C. Koretz J.F. FEBS Lett. 1987; 222: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), a combination of the micellar and three-layer model (33Walsh M.T. Sen A.C. Chakrabarti B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20079-20084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a rhombic dodecahedron (38Wistow G. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 56: 729-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and a pore-like structure (39Carver J.A. Aquilina J.A. Truscott R.J.W. Exp. Eye Res. 1994; 59: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In the absence of x-ray crystallographic data, the quaternary structure of α-crystallin remains speculative and is a matter of controversy. α-Crystallin is isolated as spherical molecules with diameters of about 15 nm and molecular masses of 800–900 kDa (s 20, w ∼ 17–18 S) (36Siezen R.J. Bindels J.G. Hoenders H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, when the isolation is performed at 37 °C, α-crystallin exhibits a molecular mass of approximately 360 kDa (s 20, w ∼ 12 S) (40Thomson J.A. Augusteyn R.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1983; 37: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The aggregation state of α-crystallin and hence the sedimentation coefficient and molecular mass also varies with experimental conditions such as ionic strengths, temperature, and pH (35Tardieu A. Laporte D. Licinio P. Krop B. Delaye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 36Siezen R.J. Bindels J.G. Hoenders H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, important to study the quaternary structure of α-crystallin (the aggregation state, size, etc.) with temperature under our present experimental conditions in the context of its chaperone-like activity. We have performed gel filtration chromatography of α-crystallin at different temperatures on a Sephacryl S-300 (high resolution) column provided with a jacket for water circulation. The protein was allowed to pass though the column, which was equilibrated at the required temperatures. The column matrix used withstands high temperatures and is autoclavable (Pharmacia). The void volume of the column was measured at different temperature using the elution profile of blue dextran. It is evident from Fig. 6 that α-crystallin elutes at 37 °C as a marginally smaller particle compared with that at 22 °C. At 62 °C, the elution position of the major portion of α-crystallin with respect to the elution position of blue dextran is not very different from its position at 22 °C. However, the elution profile shows more heterogeneous populations of α-crystallin at 62 °C (Fig. 6). It is important to note that the rearrangement in the relative occupancies of the subunits with respect to one another or perturbations in the domain packing within the individual subunits with temperature, if any, may not be detected in the chromatographic profiles. We also performed sedimentation analysis on α-crystallin samples pre-incubated at different temperatures. The sedimentation coefficient (s 20, w) of α-crystallin in our experimental conditions is found to be about 18 S. It is reduced to 16.2 and 14.7 S upon incubating at 37 °C for 1 and 20 h, respectively. It is to be noted that our gel filtration experiments show only marginal change in the elution profile of α-crystallin at 37 °C. We have also found that the elution profile of α-crystallin sample, which is pre-incubated at 37 °C for 20 h, is also not changed appreciably (data not shown). Siezen et al. (36Siezen R.J. Bindels J.G. Hoenders H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) showed by electron microscopy that the mean diameter of the temperature (37 °C)-modified α-crystallin is the same, within experimental error, as the native protein. The electron micrographs also essentially reveal the same shape. On the other hand, the size distributions of the two proteins differ significantly (compare Fig. 5 A with Fig. 5E in Ref. 36), assuming that the sample preparation for electron microscopy did not affect the distribution. These investigators also showed that temperature-modified α-crystallin has a lower sedimentation coefficient, suggesting a structural difference as well as a difference in measured molecular mass. Whether the temperature-induced change in the molecular mass of the protein has any role in the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin is not clear. The conversion of the native α-crystallin (18 S) to the smaller particle(s) appears to be a slow process. Siezen et al. (36Siezen R.J. Bindels J.G. Hoenders H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) observe that the sedimentation coefficient is lowered appreciably upon incubating α-crystallin at 37 °C only after 5 h. Tardieuet al. report the hydrodynamic radius of α-crystallin changes significantly by incubating at 37 °C for a day. The elution of α-crystallin in our gel filtration column is complete within 2 h of application of the sample to the column. It is also important to note that the assay procedure for the chaperone-like property of α-crystallin followed by us and other workers takes much less time. For example, the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin toward the aggregation of βL-crystallin (upon refolding) in the present study is performed for 10 min. During this time period, no appreciable change in the sedimention coefficient is expected. However, during this time period, there is a significant alteration in the tertiary structure of α-crystallin (Fig. 5). Thus, it appears that the tertiary structural alterations precede the quaternary structural alterations (in terms of molecular mass) of α-crystallin with temperature. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility of quaternary structural alterations in terms of the relative arrangement of subunits and/or packing of domains within the subunits themselves. It is interesting to note the state of α-crystallin at 62 °C. At this temperature, α-crystallin almost completely loses its tertiary structure although possessing substantial amount of secondary structure. This state of α-crystallin is similar to that of the molten globule state of proteins. Molten globule states of proteins, detected on the unfolding or refolding pathways of proteins, are characterized as having substantial amounts of secondary structure although lacking rigid tertiary structure (41Baldwin R.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 84-91Crossref Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 42Ptitsyn O.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 83-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Ptitsyn O.B. Creighton T.E. Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 243-300Google Scholar). In most of the earlier studies, the molten globule state was obtained either as equilibrium or kinetic intermediate on the unfolding or refolding pathways of monomeric proteins. Recently Singh et al. (44Singh N. Liu Z. Fisher H.F. Biophys. Chem. 1996; 63: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) reported an intermediate of the hexameric enzyme, glutamate dehydrogenase, with molten globule-like properties, based on differential scanning calorimetric studies. Our present study shows that α-crystallin, a multimeric protein, undergoes a transition at around 62 °C in which the near UV-CD spectrum indicates loss of all its tertiary structure, but the far UV-CD spectrum shows an increase in the ellipticity. Increase in the ellipticity in the far UV-CD spectra has also been observed for many proteins in their molten globule state (43Ptitsyn O.B. Creighton T.E. Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 243-300Google Scholar). Thus, α-crystallin undergoes a transition to a molten globule-like state at 62 °C. As mentioned earlier, we have shown that the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin is more pronounced at temperatures above 30 °C (our earlier studies (17Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and the present study). On probing the hydrophobic surfaces of α-crystallin using pyrene, we have shown that the hydrophobic surfaces of α-crystallin are exposed above 30 °C with two perceptible transitions, one at ∼30 °C and another at ∼50 °C (17Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Differential scanning calorimetric studies on α-crystallin by Walsh et al. (33Walsh M.T. Sen A.C. Chakrabarti B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20079-20084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) show two endothermic transitions, a relatively minor one at 35–45 °C and another major transition at around 60 °C. The chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin in preventing the aggregation of other proteins is generally studied at elevated temperatures (60–75 °C). Our results show that at these temperatures α-crystallin exists in a molten globule-like state. Thus, it appears that this state of α-crystallin is also capable of preventing the aggregation of other proteins. However, the transition observed around 30 °C seems to be important and biologically relevant. At this temperature, α-crystallin undergoes a minor change in its tertiary structure accompanying the exposure of its hydrophobic surfaces (17Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) (due to the exposure of specific regions (30Smith J.B. Liu Y. Smith D.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) of its sequence), whereas its secondary structure is relatively unchanged. It is possible that these changes are due to the reorganization of the subunits within the aggregate and/or small perturbation in the packing of domains within the subunits themselves. This state exhibits enhanced chaperone-like activity in preventing the aggregation of other proteins compared with those states below 30 °C. Our results also suggest that the chaperone assay performed at around physiological temperature would provide more meaningful results rather than those performed at elevated (>50 °C) or lower (<30 °C) temperatures. Whether the temperature-dependent chaperone property of α-crystallin is common to all heat shock proteins and chaperones is not clear. However, recently there have been several reports of differential function of molecular chaperones at different temperatures. Hayer Hartl et al. (45Hayer Hartl M.K. Weber F. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6111-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) observe that the ATP hydrolysis is not required in the activation of rhodanese by the GroEL and GroES machinery at 37 °C, whereas it is essential at 20 °C (45Hayer Hartl M.K. Weber F. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6111-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The heat shock protein, hsp90, known to function as molecular chaperone, binds more effectively to unfolded proteins in its thermally modified form (46Yonehara M. Minami Y. Kawata Y. Nagai J. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2641-2645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Brunschier et al. (47Brunschier R. Danner M. Seckler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2767-2772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) report a similar temperature-dependent interaction between GroEL and phage P22 tail-spike protein: above 30 °C, folding intermediates bind to GroEL, whereas below 25 °C GroEL has no apparent interaction with the nascent protein. Hansen and Gafni (48Hansen J.E. Gafni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6286-6289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) observe that GroEL, in the absence of GroES and ATP, enhances the refolding of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase but fully arrests the process above 30 °C. Whether the properties of these chaperones at different temperatures are due to structural changes in these chaperones, as observed in the case of α-crystallin, is not known. It is possible that structural alterations induced by temperature form a part of the general mechanism of chaperone function, because they are required to function more effectively at nonpermissible temperatures.

Not a single consensus structure has yet been identified within the G protein-coupled superfamily that uniquely defines the G protein binding function. Mutagenesis studies on adrenergic receptors and rhodopsin indicate that the C-terminal domains of the third intracellular loop (ICL3) and the N-terminal region of the cytosolic tail are essential for coupling to G proteins (8Franke R.R.

By contrast, the regions of the thyrotropin receptor essential for intracellular signal transduction appear to be the first intracellular loop (ICL1) and the C-terminal regions of the second intracellular loop (ICL2) and the third intracellular loop (ICL3) (11Chazenbalk G.D.

Four isoforms of prostaglandin E receptor subtype EP3, which differ only at their C-terminal tails and are produced by alternative splicing, couple to different G proteins.

We reported observations suggesting that the acidic-arginine-aromatic (DRY) triplet of ICL2, the C-terminal portion of ICL2, the C-terminal region of ICL3, and the cytosolic C-terminal tail region were involved in G protein coupling. Our data from transient transfection of the AT1Areceptor in COS7 cells showed that the last 50 amino acid residues (beyond Phe309) were also important for Gqcoupling (14Ohyama K. Yamano Y. Chaki S. Kondo T. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thomas et al. (15Thomas W.G. Thekkumkara T.J. Motel T.J. Baker K.M. J. Biol.

Thus, we focused on the amino acid sequence between Lys310 and Leu314, constructed five deletional mutants and four substitutional mutants of rat AT1A, and examined their InsP3 production and ligand binding. We also synthesized nine peptides based on the amino acid sequence of the cytosolic region and examined their Gq activation with the aim of defining a region in the C-tail essential for the coupling to Gq in rat AT1A. The entire coding region of rat kidney AT1A was cloned into EcoRI site of a plasmid pUC19 (16Iwai N. Yamano Y. Chaki S. Konishi F. Bardhan S. Tibbett C. Sasaki K. Hasegawa M. Matsuda Y. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). A KpnI-EcoRI fragment was subcloned into polylinker sites of the plasmid vector pBluescript II KS+, and single-stranded DNA was prepared using helper phage R 408 (Stratagene). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the procedure of Kunkel (17Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). Sites of truncation and substitution are shown in Fig.1. The mutated DNA sequences were confirmed by Sanger's dideoxynucleotide sequencing method (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52250) Google Scholar). The mutated AT1A cDNA was excised with enzymesBamHI and XhoI and introduced into the expression vector pCDNA1. Forty μg of plasmid constructs containing the wild type or mutated rat AT1A cDNA were co-transfected with 1 μg of pSV-G1-Neo (Green Cross Corp.) into 5 × 106 of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells in 500 μl of phosphate buffer using a gene pulser (Bio-Rad). Native CHO-K1 cells do not express Ang II receptor. Transfected CHO-K1 cells were cultured for 2 days in 10-cm dishes in Ham's F12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum. Then the culture medium was changed to selection medium containing 400 μg/ml Geneticin (G418, Life Technologies, Inc.). When individual colonies emerged 10–14 days after the transfection, 60 sufficiently separated colonies were isolated and inoculated into 200 μl of selection medium in 96-well plates. Each of these colonies was scaled up independently to 24-well plates, and the binding assay was performed using 125I-Ang II (NEN Life Science Products). The binding assay was repeated three times for each clone. Two colonies were selected after the binding assay, and 300 single cells isolated from the colonies were cultured in the selection medium in 96-well plates. Two or three weeks later, each of these clones was scaled up independently to 24-well plates, and binding assay was performed again. The clone expressing the highest specific binding of125I-Ang II was selected. AT1A-expressing CHO-K1 cells were grown in Ham's F12 medium with 10% fetal calf serum in 24-well plates. They were washed with Hank's balanced salt solution and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C in 250 μl of Ham's F12 medium with 2% fetal calf serum. Varying concentrations of [125I-Sar1,Ile8]Ang II (NEN Life Science Products) from 0.3 to 10 nm were incubated in this medium for determination of the specific binding. After the incubation, cells were immediately placed on ice, washed three times with ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution, and then solubilized with 250 μl of 0.5 n NaOH. Radioactivity was measured by a gamma counter. Specific [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding was determined as the difference between the total binding of [125I-Sar1,Ile8]Ang II in the absence and presence of 1 μm[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II. Nonspecific binding was below 15% of the total binding. The dissociation constant (K d) for [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding was determined by Scatchard analysis. CHO-K1 cells transfected with mutated AT1A cDNA were grown in 35-mm dishes. Confluent cells were washed with 1.0 ml of 20 mm HEPES buffer, preincubated in 0.5 ml of 20 mm HEPES buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 20 min at 37 °C, then in 0.5 ml of HEPES buffer with 0.1% BSA and 10 mm LiCl for 10 min. Then the cells were incubated in the same HEPES buffer with or without 1 μm Ang II for 10 s at 37 °C. InsP3was extracted with a 1.5-ml mixture of chloroform/methanol, 12n HCl (1:2:0.05, v/v). A 0.4-ml mixture of chloroform and distilled water (1:1, v/v) was added to the extract and centrifuged. The supernatant was washed with 0.8 ml of chloroform and centrifuged. The supernatant was dried in a Speedvac. The dried extract was redissolved with 150 μl of distilled water, sonicated for 30 min, and centrifuged. InsP3 in 100 μl of the supernatant was measured by competitive receptor binding using an InsP3assay kit (NEN Life Science Products). Transfected CHO-K1 cells were grown in 10-cm dishes, washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution, scraped, and collected by centrifugation at 1500 ×g for 5 min. The plasma membrane fraction was prepared by a published method (19Chaki S. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 388-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Membranes obtained were suspended at a protein concentration of 250 μg/ml in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 200 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% BSA, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and used as the membrane preparation. Dose response was determined as follows. Suspended membranes were incubated with 0.1 nm125I-Ang II at 25 °C for 60 min in the presence of varying concentrations of GTPγS. For studying the time course of ligand binding, membranes were incubated with 0.1 nm125I-Ang II for 60 min at 37 °C to attain binding equilibrium and unlabeled Ang II (1 μm) or GTPγS (10 μm) or both of them were added to the mixture and incubated for another 60 min. The membrane-bound radioligand was separated from the free radioligand by filtration over glass filters (GF/B) using a cell harvester (Millipore). Radioactivity was measured in a gamma counter. The amino acid sequences of the peptides used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. They were synthesized by the solid-phase method and purified to 95–99% homogeneity by high performance liquid chromatography using a Nucleosil 5 C18 column eluted with a linear concentration gradient (0–60%) of CH3CN containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The lyophilized synthetic peptide was dissolved in water. Heterotrimeric forms of Gq proteins from bovine liver were purified to homogeneity as published (20Taylor S.J. Smith J.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17150-17156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [35S]GTPγS binding to 10 nm purified heterotrimeric Gq promoted by synthetic peptides was measured in 25 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 120 μm MgCl2, 100 μm EDTA, and 100 nm[35S]GTPγS in the absence of phospholipids as described by Okamoto et al. (9Okamoto T. Murayama Y. Hayashi Y. Inagaki M. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. Cell. 1991; 67: 723-730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Briefly, Gq was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in the absence (control) or presence of a synthetic peptide (100 μm). The incubation was terminated by addition of 10 volumes of ice-cold stopping buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 25 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 20 μm GTP. After a 50-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was rapidly filtered through a nitrocellulose filter (pore size, 0.45 μm) and washed three times with the stopping buffer, the filter was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The maximal binding of [35S]GTPγS to Gq was measured in the presence of 1 μm GTPγS and 25 mmMg2+ at room temperature by the method of Northup et al. (21Northup J.K. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11416-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a positive control. The results of experiments with the synthetic peptide study was examined by unpaired Student'st test. p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. As shown in TableI the dissociation constants (K d) and B max values of the wild type AT1A and its mutants determined by Scatchard analysis were similar, indicating that the mutants possessed similar ligand binding affinity and sites of comparable magnitude. In this study [125I-Sar1,Ile8]Ang II was used as ligand. Scatchard plots indicated single high affinity sites. When 125I-Ang II was used as ligand results indicated similar single high affinity sites. The possible presence of low affinity sites was practically undetectable.Table IBinding affinity of [Sar1-Ile8]Ang II binding for rat AT1A wild type receptor and mutant receptorsK dB maxnmfmol/mg proteinWild type1.6 ± 0.118.8 ± 1.4Mut 310-del2.4 ± 0.216.0 ± 1.1Mut 312-del2.4 ± 0.217.8 ± 1.6Mut 313-del2.0 ± 0.315.2 ± 1.8Mut 314-del1.8 ± 0.215.6 ± 1.6Mut 318-del2.5 ± 0.317.8 ± 1.8Mut Y312A2.4 ± 0.416.6 ± 1.8Mut F313A2.6 ± 0.415.5 ± 1.9Mut L314A2.8 ± 0.314.8 ± 1.2Mut K310,311Q2.7 ± 0.318.3 ± 1.4Data represent results of three identical series of binding isotherms followed by Scatchard analysis. Results are presented as means ± S.D. Open table in a new tab Data represent results of three identical series of binding isotherms followed by Scatchard analysis. Results are presented as means ± S.D. As shown in Fig.2, the binding of 125I-Ang II to wild type AT1A, Mut 318-del, and Mut K310,311Q receptors were dose-dependently decreased by GTPγS, whereas the effect of GTPγS (shift from a high affinity state to a low affinity form) was practically abolished in Mut 310-del, Mut 312-del, Mut 313-del, Mut 314-del, Mut Y312A, Mut F313A, and Mut L314A receptors. Time-related changes in dissociation of 125I-Ang II from the wild type and mutated receptors are shown in Fig.3. The binding of 125I-Ang II to the receptors in membrane preparations reached a plateau in 60 min. In wild type AT1A and all of its mutants, the receptor-bound 125I-Ang II was displaced by 1 μm unlabeled Ang II to similar extents (the range of half-life time of dissociation was 19.5 to 21.4 min). GTPγS (10 μm) markedly shortened the half-life time of the spontaneous dissociation in the wild type AT1A, and Mut 318-del, and Mut-K310,311Q receptors (3.5 to 4.6 min), whereas the binding of 125I-Ang II remained unchanged for 60 min in Mut 310-del, Mut 312-del, Mut 313-del, and Mut 314-del. Moreover, although the half-life times in the wild type AT1A and Mut 318-del were shortened in the presence of both Ang II and GTPγS (0.9 to 1.2 min), those in other deletion mutants were similar to the half-life time in the presence of Ang II alone (17.0 to 20.1 min). Binding of Ang II to AT1A activates a PLC via Gq resulting in stimulation of InsP3 formation. Thus, increased InsP3 formation by Ang II can be considered to indicate effective coupling to Gq of the mutants. In unmutated AT1A, InsP3 production was significantly increased from 2.52 ± 0.05 pmol/dish of unstimulated control to 16.55 ± 1.88 pmol/dish at 10 s after Ang II stimulation. Similar results were obtained in Mut 318-del and Mut K310,311Q. By contrast, in Mut 310-del, Mut 312-del, Mut 313-del, Mut 314-del, Mut Y312A, Mut F313A, and Mut L314A responses of InsP3 to Ang II stimulation were abolished (Fig.4). Gq was incubated for 10 min in the presence of [35S]GTPγS with peptides representing domains in the cytoplasmic segments of native AT1A (P-1 to P-5) or mutated peptides of P-5. As shown in Fig.5, Peptides P-3 and P-5 activated Gq as well as positive control. The Gq-activating function was attenuated to 25% relative to intact P-5 in Mut P-5 (Tyr312, Phe313, and Leu314 were replaced by alanine). The uptake of [35S]GTPγS was significantly lower in Mut Y, Mut F (p < 0.01) and Mut L (p < 0.05) than in P-5. The cytoplasmic C-terminal (C-tail) region was shown to play an essential role in agonist-induced receptor internalization (15Thomas W.G. Thekkumkara T.J. Motel T.J. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 207-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, its role in the G protein-coupled phospholipase activation has been controversial. Now in three independent approaches using five deletion mutants, four alanine substitution mutants, and synthetic peptides with native and mutated amino acid sequences corresponding to an N-terminal region of C-tail, we were able to identify the tripeptide region Tyr312-Phe313-Leu314 (Fig.5) as a domain essential for Gq activation. Different experimental approaches produce results leading to different and sometimes contradicting conclusions. Wang et al. (13Wang C. Jayadev S. Escobedo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16677-16682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) using chimeric human AT1 with a grafted AT2C-tail that shows Gq activation concluded that the major determinant of Gq coupling specificity is in the ICL-3, and the C-tail has little role in the activation of PLC. However, we had shown that deletion beyond Phe309 (Mut 310-del) abolished the Gq-coupled inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation (14Ohyama K. Yamano Y. Chaki S. Kondo T. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Since both of these modifications could introduce additional factors such as conformational changes or the effect of ICL3 not directly related to the action of deleted or replaced residues, multiple approaches had to be taken. Loss of Gq coupling in Mut 310-del and complete recovery of the Gq activation in Mut 318-del narrowed the Gq coupling domain to residues 310–317 (Figs. 1 and 4) (14Ohyama K. Yamano Y. Chaki S. Kondo T. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The observation of a robust activity with Mut 315-del by Thomas et al. (15Thomas W.G. Thekkumkara T.J. Motel T.J. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 207-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) further narrowed it to a region between residues 310 and 314. Almost complete loss of the activity with Mut 312-del, 313-del, 314-del, and single residue alanine mutation Y312A, F313A, and L314A and the preservation of a full PLC activity with the double mutant K310Q,K311Q indicated that Tyr312-Phe313-Leu314 is the essential domain required for PLC activation. Its essential role in Gq coupling was also determined by loss of the well known GTPγS-induced shift to a low affinity state for agonist binding in these mutants (Figs. 2 and 3). Further evidence for the essential role of the tripeptide sequence for the G protein coupling was obtained by a third and completely independent approach in which peptides with the amino acid sequences of the native and alanine-substituted C-tail (residues 307–320) were allowed to interact with purified heterotrimeric Gq, and binding to [35S]GTPγS was examined. Again, alanine substitution of Tyr312-Phe313-Leu314 singly or three together significantly reduced GTPγS binding. It is interesting to note that, whereas the triple mutant Mut P-5 lost almost the entire binding ability, other mutants, particularly Mut L (L314A), retained recognizable binding, although the conformation of the C-tail domain of AT1A and the shorter synthetic segment may have a different conformation. These results suggest synergism of the three residues and some difference in the role of Tyr312 and Leu314 in Gqα activation and GTPγS binding. The G protein coupling sites seem to vary from receptor to receptor, and no definitive rules or consensus sequences seem to exist. For example the N-formyl peptide receptor uses ICL2 (22Schreiber R.E. Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. Cochrane C.G. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 326-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and G protein specificity of PGE2 receptor isoforms (EP3) is determined by the C-tail region. More than a single domain could participate in the interaction. The possibility of cooperation of ICL3 and amphipathic α-helical structure of the N-terminal region of the C-tail has been proposed by Probst et al. (23Probst W.C. Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfon S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The β-adrenergic receptor uses the C-terminal region of ICL3 and the N-terminal region of C-tail for Gs activation (10O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Regan J.W. Leader W.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15985-15992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present finding that the synthetic 16-mer peptide P-3 with the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal region of ICL3 and the C-tail peptide (P-5) activated purified Gq just as well as the C-tail peptide (P-5) (Fig. 5) supports the observation of Hunyadyet al. (24Hunyady L. Bor M. Baukal A.J. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16602-16609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) that the deletion of a sequence (215–226) in this domain abolished Gq activation. It also supports the observation of Wang et al. (13Wang C. Jayadev S. Escobedo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16677-16682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) that in chimeras of AT1 and AT2, ICL3 plays dominant roles in Gq coupling. Shirai et al. (25Shirai H. Takahashi K. Katada T. Inagami T. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 726-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed the same ICL3 domain activates Gi1, Gi2, and Go by using the synthetic peptide P-3. These results indicate that AT1A may use and require the tripeptide sequence of C-tail in collaboration with ICL3 in Gqactivation. Interesting information revealed by the activation of G proteins by these peptides are that the same peptides (P-3 and P-5) are capable of activating Gi, Go, and Gq. Mechanisms by which a receptor selects the type of G proteins are yet to be clarified. On the other hand, peptides with unrelated sequences like P-1, P-2, and P-4 which did not show the activation may be considered as controls and indicate that activation by P-3 and P-5 is specific to their sequences. B max values of mutated receptors expressed in each cell line were at levels comparable to that of the wild type. Hence, the decrease in InsP3 formation in Mut 310-del, Mut 312-del, Mut 313-del, Mut 314-del, Mut Y312A, Mut F313A, and Mut L314A should be due to the receptor mutation rather than a decrease in expression of each mutant receptor. Our previous study using substitutional mutations of basic polar amino acid residues in ICL2 and ICL3 indicated that ICL2 and the C-terminal domain of ICL3 would be important for Gq coupling (14Ohyama K. Yamano Y. Chaki S. Kondo T. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These mutations targeted at domains with dense electrical charges probably caused nonspecific conformational changes and led to erroneous results that could be misinterpreted. Tyr292 in transmembrane domain 7 was reported to be essential for G protein coupling (26Marie J. Maigret B. Joseph M.-P. Larguier R. Nouet S. Lombard C. Bonnafous J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20815-20818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Strosberg A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The conserved sequence NPLFY at the bottom of transmembrane domain 7 was shown to contribute to both agonist binding and signal transduction (24Hunyady L. Bor M. Baukal A.J. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16602-16609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, the junctional area of AT1 between transmembrane domain 7 and C-tail seems to play an important role in receptor signaling. This area of AT1 also contains the sequence KKFKK that was shown to be an unusual Gi activator domain of insulin growth factor II receptor (9Okamoto T. Murayama Y. Hayashi Y. Inagaki M. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. Cell. 1991; 67: 723-730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, in AT1 mutation to Lys-Lys-Phe-Gln310-Gln311 did not have any effect on Gq coupling. This observation helped our work in narrowing the Gq activating domain to Tyr312-Phe313-Leu314. In summary, the present study presents evidence that a Gqcoupling site in the type 1A angiotensin receptor AT1Ashould reside between residues 312 and 318 in the C-terminal tail, and the specific sequence Tyr312-Phe313-Leu314 is essential for coupling and activation of the Gq protein.

To identify regions of MutS protein in close proximity to the heteroduplex DNA, we have utilized the photoactivated cross-linking moiety 5-iododeoxyuridine (5-IdUrd). Nucleoprotein complexes of Thermus aquaticus MutS protein bound to monosubstituted 5-IdUrd-containing heteroduplex DNAs were cross-linked with long-wavelength ultraviolet light. Positioning of the 5-IdUrd moiety at one of three positions within the DNA bulge, two nucleotides upstream or three nucleotides downstream of the unpaired base, resulted in an identical subset of cross-linked peptides as determined by proteolytic fingerprinting. The tryptic peptide cross-linked to an unpaired 5-IdUrd residue was determined by peptide sequencing to correspond to a highly conserved region spanning residues 25–49. Cross-linking to the bulge nucleotide occurred at Phe-39, indicating that this residue contacts, or is in close proximity to, the unpaired base of a heteroduplex DNA. Site-directed mutagenesis resulting in the substitution of Ala for Phe-39 reduced the affinity of the mutant protein for heteroduplex DNA by roughly 3 orders of magnitude, but had no apparent effect on its ability to dimerize, its thermostability, or its ATPase activity.

DNA mismatch repair is critical for mutation avoidance in virtually all organisms. In addition to its role in the repair of base pair mismatches and insertion/deletion mutations, mismatch repair serves as a barrier to homologous recombination between evolutionarily divergent sequences (reviewed in Ref. 1Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). The importance of mismatch repair is highlighted in its role in cancer surveillance; defects in highly conserved components of mismatch repair have been implicated in both hereditary and sporadic tumors (reviewed in Ref. 2Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar; see also Ref.3Risinger J.I. Umar A. Boyd J. Berchuck A. Kunkel T.A. Barrett J.C. Nat. Gen. 1996; 14: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In addition, defects in mismatch repair have been implicated in the rapid evolution and spread of pathogenic virulence in enteric bacteria (4LeClerc J.E. Li B. Payne W.L. Cebula T.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1208-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar).Recognition of mispaired or unpaired bases during mismatch repair is carried out by the family of MutS proteins whose members are found in many organisms from bacteria to man. Biochemical studies demonstrate that purified MutS proteins bind to heteroduplex DNAs containing unpaired or mispaired bases in vitro (reviewed in Refs. 1Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar,2Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, and 5Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar); however, the molecular details of heteroduplex DNA recognition by MutS, including the identity of structural determinants involved in mismatch recognition, remain obscure.To identify regions of MutS protein in close contact with the heteroduplex DNA, we have carried out photocross-linking of nucleoprotein complexes containing a MutS protein from Thermus aquaticus bound to a derivatized heteroduplex DNA containing 5-iododeoxyuridine (5-IdUrd), 1The abbreviations used are: 5-IdUrd, 5-iododeoxyuridine; DTT, dithiothreitol; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. 1The abbreviations used are: 5-IdUrd, 5-iododeoxyuridine; DTT, dithiothreitol; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. a photoactivated zero-length cross-linker (6Willis M.C. Hicke B.J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Cech T.R. Koch T.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1255-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Taq MutS protein has a higher affinityin vitro for heteroduplexes containing insertion/deletions compared with a G:T mismatch and, on the basis of chemical probe experiments, appears to interact with both the major and minor grooves of a heteroduplex DNA in the immediate vicinity of an unpaired base (7Biswas I. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5040-5048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,8Biswas I. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13355-13364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Photocross-linking of DNA-protein complexes has been used to identify regions of a protein in close proximity to a bound DNA. The success of the approach hinges on the requirement for close proximity of an amino acid especially in the case of a zero-length cross-linking moiety, the need for the amino acid to assume an appropriate geometry for cross-linking, and the chemical reactivity of a potential target amino acid. For these reasons, not all amino acid residues in close contact with the DNA will be identified by cross-linking. Conversely, a cross-linked region, while close to the DNA, need not constitute part of a DNA-binding domain. Nevertheless, in the absence of a high-resolution structure, cross-linking experiments combined with mutational analysis of a candidate region can provide a starting point for identifying regions of a protein involved in DNA binding.Photocross-linking of halogenated pyrimidines has been used to identify point contacts in DNA- and RNA-protein complexes (9Blatter E.E. Ebright Y.W. Ebright R.H. Nature. 1992; 359: 650-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Hicke B.J. Willis M.C. Koch T.H. Cech T.R.

Specific DNA-protein photocross-linking utilizing the photoactivated 5-IdUrd cross-linking moiety has been reported by several groups. Williset al. (6Willis M.C. Hicke B.J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Cech T.R. Koch T.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1255-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) demonstrated selective cross-linking of 5-IdUrd-substituted DNA to the Oxytricha telomere protein α-subunit following long-wavelength UV irradiation at 325 nm. Recently, we (12Malkov V.A. Camerini-Otero R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30230-30233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and others (13Wang Y. Adzuma K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have utilized photocross-linking of a 5-IdUrd-substituted DNA to identify the DNA-binding domain of RecA protein, thereby confirming predictions based on crystallographic studies of RecA protein.Photocross-linking with the 5-IdUrd cross-linker has several desirable characteristics. First, 5-IdUrd is nearly isosteric with thymine since the van der Waals radius of iodine is only 8% larger than that of the methyl group it replaces (6Willis M.C. Hicke B.J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Cech T.R. Koch T.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1255-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Second, long-wavelength UV irradiation of 5-IdUrd-derivatized substrates results in specific cross-linking to 5-IdUrd while minimizing photodamage to other chromophores in the protein or DNA (6Willis M.C. Hicke B.J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Cech T.R. Koch T.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1255-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Third, incidental cross-linking to regions of a protein not involved in DNA binding is minimized because the 5-IdUrd moiety is a zero-length cross-linker. Fourth, several amino acids can form adducts with photoactivated pyrimidines, including cysteine, serine, methionine, lysine, arginine, histidine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine (14Chodosh L.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 12.5.1-12.5.8Google Scholar).In this paper, we show that a highly conserved region near the NH2 terminus of Taq MutS protein is cross-linked to the unpaired base of a heteroduplex DNA. Substitution of Ala for Phe-39, the point of cross-linking, results in a mutant protein that is significantly impaired in its ability to bind heteroduplex DNA, although it retains the ability to oligomerize, is thermostable, and retains functional ATPase activity. These results implicate the region in the vicinity of Phe-39 as being crucial for heteroduplex DNA binding by Taq MutS protein.DISCUSSIONPhotocross-linking of Taq MutS protein to a derivatized heteroduplex DNA containing a 5-IdUrd cross-linking moiety reveals that a region at the NH2 terminus of MutS is closely associated with the major groove of the heteroduplex DNA. Peptide sequencing of the limit trypsin digest of the cross-linked peptide indicates that it maps to residues 25–49, with Phe-39 being the point of cross-linking. Substitution of Ala for Phe-39 results in a mutant protein whose relative affinity for heteroduplex DNA is 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of the wild-type MutS protein. The severe deficiency in DNA binding resulting from a single amino acid change at Phe-39 is not attributable to a gross alteration in the conformation of the mutant protein. The F39A mutant protein is able to dimerize like its wild-type counterpart. In addition, the F39A mutant protein retains thermostability and an ATPase activity that is essentially unchanged from that of the wild-type MutS protein. Taken together, these data strongly implicate the region near Phe-39 as being critical for heteroduplex binding by Taq MutS protein.The importance of the region in the vicinity of Phe-39 of Taq MutS protein for heteroduplex binding is supported by the extensive sequence conservation of this region among prokaryotic and eukaryotic MutS proteins. While the highest degree of conservation resides in regions near the C terminus including the Walker consensus sequence for magnesium-dependent ATP binding and a helix-turn-helix motif (7Biswas I. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5040-5048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the cross-linked region spans a number of conserved residues. Phe-39, the point of cross-linking, is itself highly conserved with two exceptions. In yeast and human MSH3 proteins, the corresponding position is a Lys residue. Interestingly, in both cases, the Lys residue is flanked on both sides by aromatic Tyr residues. Inspection of the region in the vicinity of Phe-39 reveals that it is very hydrophobic, with conserved aromatic residues at positions 27, 34, 39, 40, and 43. A hypothesis, as yet untested, is that this region is involved in hydrophobic interactions with the major groove of a heteroduplex DNA. The region shown in Fig.7 corresponds to the smallest tryptic peptide cross-linked to the DNA; the actual region at the N terminus of MutS involved in DNA binding may be larger or smaller.While the cross-linked region is conserved in virtually all MutS homologs, there are two notable exceptions. A search of GenBank™ data base sequences (Release 100) using BLAST for homology to the first 50 amino acids of Taq MutS protein identified all known members of the MutS family except Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH4 and MSH5. Multiple sequence alignments of MutS family members using Pileup (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI) suggest that MSH4 and MSH5 may have lost the putative DNA-binding domain identified in this study since the first amino acids of MSH4 and MSH5 align at Taq MutS positions 73 and 101, respectively. Interestingly, the MSH4 and MSH5 homologs do not appear to function in mismatch repair sincemsh4 (17Ross-MacDonald P. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1069-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and msh5 (18Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Halsey C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1728-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) mutants do not have a mutator phenotype. Instead, these mutants have increased levels of nondisjunction of homologous chromosomes at meiosis I resulting from decreased levels of reciprocal exchanges between homologs, suggesting that MSH4 and MSH5 proteins function in the regulation of homologous recombination. On the basis of these findings, it has been proposed that MSH4 and MSH5 have evolved to interact with intermediates of homologous recombination rather than mismatches or unpaired bases. These findings concerning MSH4 and MSH5 lend indirect support to our contention that the NH2-terminal region of MutS is involved in the recognition of heteroduplex DNA during mismatch repair.The cross-linking data constitute independent support for interactions of MutS proteins with the major groove of the heteroduplex DNA.

The 5-IdUrd cross-linking moiety used in this study is a zero-distance cross-linker positioned in the major groove of the heteroduplex. Although the geometry of the unpaired 5-IdUrd base within the nucleoprotein complex containing heteroduplex Δ1-I(0) is unknown, the fact that the identical clostripain peptide was cross-linked to heteroduplexes Δ1-I(−2) and Δ1-I(+3) in which the 5-IdUrd moieties are stacked within the duplex (20Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry Part I: The Conformation of Biological Macromolecules. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1980: 311-341Google Scholar) suggests that the NH2-terminal region of Taq MutS protein is in close proximity to the major groove near an unpaired base. These data suggest that the specificity of heteroduplex DNA recognition is achieved by the interaction of MutS protein with the mispaired or unpaired base and, at a minimum, constituents residing in the major groove of flanking residues near the lesion.

Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may serve to increase the affinity of MutS protein for nonspecific DNA contacts.Photocross-linking of Phe-39 to a heteroduplex and characterization of a mutant protein bearing a substitution of Ala for of Phe-39 suggest that Phe-39 is involved in heteroduplex DNA binding by MutS protein. We note, however, that the exact role of Phe-39 in DNA binding has not been established. Phe-39 may make direct contacts with the unpaired base. If so, the low levels of cross-linking to the heteroduplexes substituted at positions −2 and +3 must involve residues other than Phe-39, a prediction we have not tested. Alternatively, despite its close proximity to the unpaired base, Phe-39 may have an indirect role in DNA binding, contributing, for example, to the conformational stability of the DNA-binding site. Finally, the identification of other residues critical for DNA binding that reside in the vicinity of Phe-39 as well as elsewhere in the MutS polypeptide awaits further study. DNA mismatch repair is critical for mutation avoidance in virtually all organisms. In addition to its role in the repair of base pair mismatches and insertion/deletion mutations, mismatch repair serves as a barrier to homologous recombination between evolutionarily divergent sequences (reviewed in Ref. 1Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). The importance of mismatch repair is highlighted in its role in cancer surveillance; defects in highly conserved components of mismatch repair have been implicated in both hereditary and sporadic tumors (reviewed in Ref. 2Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar; see also Ref.3Risinger J.I. Umar A. Boyd J. Berchuck A. Kunkel T.A. Barrett J.C. Nat. Gen. 1996; 14: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In addition, defects in mismatch repair have been implicated in the rapid evolution and spread of pathogenic virulence in enteric bacteria (4LeClerc J.E. Li B. Payne W.L. Cebula T.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1208-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Recognition of mispaired or unpaired bases during mismatch repair is carried out by the family of MutS proteins whose members are found in many organisms from bacteria to man. Biochemical studies demonstrate that purified MutS proteins bind to heteroduplex DNAs containing unpaired or mispaired bases in vitro (reviewed in Refs. 1Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar,2Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, and 5Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar); however, the molecular details of heteroduplex DNA recognition by MutS, including the identity of structural determinants involved in mismatch recognition, remain obscure. To identify regions of MutS protein in close contact with the heteroduplex DNA, we have carried out photocross-linking of nucleoprotein complexes containing a MutS protein from Thermus aquaticus bound to a derivatized heteroduplex DNA containing 5-iododeoxyuridine (5-IdUrd), 1The abbreviations used are: 5-IdUrd, 5-iododeoxyuridine; DTT, dithiothreitol; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. 1The abbreviations used are: 5-IdUrd, 5-iododeoxyuridine; DTT, dithiothreitol; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. a photoactivated zero-length cross-linker (6Willis M.C. Hicke B.J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Cech T.R. Koch T.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1255-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Taq MutS protein has a higher affinityin vitro for heteroduplexes containing insertion/deletions compared with a G:T mismatch and, on the basis of chemical probe experiments, appears to interact with both the major and minor grooves of a heteroduplex DNA in the immediate vicinity of an unpaired base (7Biswas I. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5040-5048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,8Biswas I. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13355-13364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Photocross-linking of DNA-protein complexes has been used to identify regions of a protein in close proximity to a bound DNA. The success of the approach hinges on the requirement for close proximity of an amino acid especially in the case of a zero-length cross-linking moiety, the need for the amino acid to assume an appropriate geometry for cross-linking, and the chemical reactivity of a potential target amino acid. For these reasons, not all amino acid residues in close contact with the DNA will be identified by cross-linking. Conversely, a cross-linked region, while close to the DNA, need not constitute part of a DNA-binding domain. Nevertheless, in the absence of a high-resolution structure, cross-linking experiments combined with mutational analysis of a candidate region can provide a starting point for identifying regions of a protein involved in DNA binding. Photocross-linking of halogenated pyrimidines has been used to identify point contacts in DNA- and RNA-protein complexes (9Blatter E.E. Ebright Y.W. Ebright R.H. Nature. 1992; 359: 650-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Hicke B.J. Willis M.C. Koch T.H. Cech T.R.

Specific DNA-protein photocross-linking utilizing the photoactivated 5-IdUrd cross-linking moiety has been reported by several groups. Williset al. (6Willis M.C. Hicke B.J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Cech T.R. Koch T.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1255-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) demonstrated selective cross-linking of 5-IdUrd-substituted DNA to the Oxytricha telomere protein α-subunit following long-wavelength UV irradiation at 325 nm. Recently, we (12Malkov V.A. Camerini-Otero R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30230-30233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and others (13Wang Y. Adzuma K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have utilized photocross-linking of a 5-IdUrd-substituted DNA to identify the DNA-binding domain of RecA protein, thereby confirming predictions based on crystallographic studies of RecA protein. Photocross-linking with the 5-IdUrd cross-linker has several desirable characteristics. First, 5-IdUrd is nearly isosteric with thymine since the van der Waals radius of iodine is only 8% larger than that of the methyl group it replaces (6Willis M.C. Hicke B.J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Cech T.R. Koch T.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1255-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Second, long-wavelength UV irradiation of 5-IdUrd-derivatized substrates results in specific cross-linking to 5-IdUrd while minimizing photodamage to other chromophores in the protein or DNA (6Willis M.C. Hicke B.J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Cech T.R. Koch T.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1255-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Third, incidental cross-linking to regions of a protein not involved in DNA binding is minimized because the 5-IdUrd moiety is a zero-length cross-linker. Fourth, several amino acids can form adducts with photoactivated pyrimidines, including cysteine, serine, methionine, lysine, arginine, histidine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine (14Chodosh L.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 12.5.1-12.5.8Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that a highly conserved region near the NH2 terminus of Taq MutS protein is cross-linked to the unpaired base of a heteroduplex DNA. Substitution of Ala for Phe-39, the point of cross-linking, results in a mutant protein that is significantly impaired in its ability to bind heteroduplex DNA, although it retains the ability to oligomerize, is thermostable, and retains functional ATPase activity. These results implicate the region in the vicinity of Phe-39 as being crucial for heteroduplex DNA binding by Taq MutS protein.

https://openalex.org/W1996528471,"Agonist-dependent internalization of the rat somatostatin receptor subtype 3 (SSTR3) requires four hydroxyl amino acids (Ser341, Ser346, Ser351, and Thr357) in the receptor C terminus (Roth, A., Kreienkamp, H.-J., Nehring, R., Roostermann, D., Meyerhof, W. and Richter, D. (1997) DNA Cell Biol. 16, 111–119). Here we report on the molecular mechanism responsible for the endocytotic process by analyzing the agonist-dependent phosphorylation of wild-type and mutant receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney cells. Wild-type SSTR3 is phosphorylated in response to agonist treatment. Phosphorylation is markedly reduced in a S341A/S346A/S351A triple mutant and is also reduced, but to a lesser extent, in the T357A point mutant. Internalization of the wild-type receptor is preceded by a functional desensitization of the receptor; in contrast, the triple serine mutant does not desensitize after treatment with agonists as assayed by its ability to inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. After internalization via a clathrin-coated vesicle mediated endocytotic pathway, SSTR3 efficiently recycles to the cell surface, suggesting that agonist mediated endocytosis is necessary for the functional resensitization of a phosphorylated and desensitized receptor. Agonist-dependent internalization of the rat somatostatin receptor subtype 3 (SSTR3) requires four hydroxyl amino acids (Ser341, Ser346, Ser351, and Thr357) in the receptor C terminus (Roth, A., Kreienkamp, H.-J., Nehring, R., Roostermann, D., Meyerhof, W. and Richter, D. (1997) DNA Cell Biol. 16, 111–119). Here we report on the molecular mechanism responsible for the endocytotic process by analyzing the agonist-dependent phosphorylation of wild-type and mutant receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney cells. Wild-type SSTR3 is phosphorylated in response to agonist treatment. Phosphorylation is markedly reduced in a S341A/S346A/S351A triple mutant and is also reduced, but to a lesser extent, in the T357A point mutant. Internalization of the wild-type receptor is preceded by a functional desensitization of the receptor; in contrast, the triple serine mutant does not desensitize after treatment with agonists as assayed by its ability to inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. After internalization via a clathrin-coated vesicle mediated endocytotic pathway, SSTR3 efficiently recycles to the cell surface, suggesting that agonist mediated endocytosis is necessary for the functional resensitization of a phosphorylated and desensitized receptor. Prolonged exposure of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; SST, somatostatin; SSTR, somatostatin receptor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; SST, somatostatin; SSTR, somatostatin receptor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. to their agonists frequently causes a diminution of the initial response. This phenomenon has been termed desensitization, and it is often associated with phosphorylation of the receptor protein followed by binding of the regulatory protein β-arrestin (1Hausdorff W.P.

Pitcher J. Attramadal H. Caron M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1992; 57: 127-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The receptor is then internalized into an intracellular compartment where it is inaccessible to hydrophilic ligands. β-Arrestin has been proposed to function as an adaptor between phosphorylated receptors and clathrin cages, thus directing receptors to the endocytotic pathway (3Ferguson S.S.G.

In the acidified environment of endosomes, the ligand is removed and the receptor is dephosphorylated and recycled to the cell surface (5Grady E.F. Slice L.W. Brant W.O. Walsh J.H. Payan D.G.

Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of receptors for the neuropeptide somatostatin (SST), the processes of desensitization and internalization are of considerable clinical importance as stable peptide analogs of somatostatin are used for the long term treatment of hypersecretory neuroendocrine tumors of the pituitary and pancreas (7Berelowitz M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3695-3696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These analogs not only inhibit hormone secretion, but also have an antiproliferative effect on tumor cells (8Buscail L. Delesque N. Esteve J.-P. Saint-Laurent N. Prats H. Clerc P. Robberecht P. Bell G.I. Liebow C. Schally A.V. Vaysse N. Susini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2315-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). They are also used for the preoperative localization of tumors by SSTR scintigraphy (9John M. Meyerhof W. Richter D. Waser B. Schaer J.-C. Scherübl H. Boese-Landgraf J. Neuhaus P. Ziske C. Mölling K. Riecken E.-O. Reubi J.C. Wiedenmann B. Gut. 1996; 38: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), a process which presumably relies on the internalization of the radioactive ligand by its target cells. The fact that somatostatin receptors and their ligands are internalized was originally disputed (10Presky D.H. Schonbrunn A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 878-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), but recently it was shown that several SSTR-expressing tumor cells do internalize radioactive SST analogs (11Hofland L.J. Van Koetsveld P.M. Waaijers M. Zuyderwijk J. Breeman W.A.P. Lamberts S.W.J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3698-3706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that in human embryonic kidney cells expressing individual rat SSTR subtypes (rSSTR1–5), SSTR1–3 are rapidly internalized in the presence of either of the two naturally occurring agonists, SST14 and SST28. SSTR5 is internalized only in the presence of SST28, whereas SSTR4 is not internalized by either agonist (12Roth A. Kreienkamp H.-J. Nehring R. Meyerhof W. Richter D. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1996; 22: 1298Google Scholar, 13Roth A. Kreienkamp H.-J. Nehring R. Roostermann D. Meyerhof W. Richter D. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Studies on the internalization of human and mouse SSTRs confirmed that internalization is subtype-selective, although some species-specific differences were reported (14Hukovic N. Panetta R. Kumar U. Patel Y.C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4046-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 15Nouel D. Gaudriault G. Houle M. Reisine T. Vincent J.-P. Mazella J. Beaudet A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The analysis of chimeras of SSTR3 and SSTR4 as well as deletion constructs and point mutants of SSTR3 has revealed that several serine residues and one threonine residue in the C-terminal intracellular domain of SSTR3 are required for internalization (13Roth A. Kreienkamp H.-J. Nehring R. Roostermann D. Meyerhof W. Richter D. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For the β2-adrenergic receptor as well as receptors for thyrotropin-releasing hormone, gastrin-releasing peptide, and neurotensin, internalization has also been shown to rely on the presence of one or more hydroxyl amino acid residues in the C-terminal tails of the receptors (1Hausdorff W.P.

Here we show that mutation of each of the four mentioned serine and threonine residues in the C terminus of SSTR3 not only severely affects the rate and extent of receptor internalization but also coincides with a reduction in the agonist-dependent phosphorylation and desensitization of mutant receptors, suggesting that phosphorylation of these residues leads to desensitization and subsequent internalization. Constructs of the rat SSTR3 containing a sequence encoding 11 amino acids of the T7 major capsid protein at the N terminus of the receptor sequence have been described previously (13Roth A. Kreienkamp H.-J. Nehring R. Roostermann D. Meyerhof W. Richter D. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). All constructs were cloned into the cytomegalovirus promoter-based expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Leeks, The Netherlands), which carries the neomycin resistance gene. Point mutants were constructed by PCR using two complementary mutagenic primers, as described by Higuchi (19PCR Protocols, A Guide to Methods and Applications, pp. 177–183, Academic Press, New YorkHiguchi, R. (1992) Recombinant PCR. In Innis, M. A., Gelfland, D. H., Sninsky, J. J., and White, T. J. (eds) PCR Protocols, A Guide to Methods and Applications, pp. 177–183, Academic Press, New York.Google Scholar). The triple serine to alanine mutant was generated by three sequential mutagenesis steps. The integrity of all constructs was verified by dideoxy sequencing. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293 cells) were obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (20Kreienkamp H.-J. Sine S.M. Maeda R.K. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8108-8114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and selected in medium containing 450 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The whole pool of G418-resistant cells was used without selection of individual cell clones. For microscopic analysis, receptor-expressing cells were grown on glass coverslips treated with poly-d-lysine. After treatment with agonists and FITC-transferrin (Molecular Probes), transfected HEK cells were immediately fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, at room temperature for 3 min. Fixed cells were washed three times with PBS, permeabilized with ice-cold methanol, and washed again three times with PBS. To reduce nonspecific antibody binding, cells were preincubated with 2% goat serum at room temperature for 1 h. Monoclonal mouse anti-T7-tag antibody (Novagen, Madison, WI) was then added, and the cells were kept at room temperature for 3–4 h. Cells were washed (five times with PBS at room temperature for 10 min), and exposed to cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgGs (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs., Inc., West Grove, PA) at room temperature for 3 h. After washing (three times with PBS at room temperature for 10 min), cells were embedded in glycerol-gelatin (Sigma, Munich, Germany). The cells were then examined using a confocal microscope (Zeiss Laser Scan Inverted 410 Axiovert microscope with an argon-krypton/helium-neon laser) with fluorescein (line selection 488 nm, main dichroic mirror 488/543 nm, emission band pass 510–525 or 515–565 nm) and cy3/rhodamine (line selection 543 nm, main dichroic mirror 488/543 nm, emission long pass 570 nm) filters. All images were processed using Adobe Photoshop on a Power MacIntosh 7600/120 computer, and printed on a Kodak photoprinter. Assays for determining the number of binding sites on transfected HEK cells after agonist-dependent internalization were carried out as previously reported (13Roth A. Kreienkamp H.-J. Nehring R. Roostermann D. Meyerhof W. Richter D. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were incubated with 1 μm SST14 at 37 °C for the times indicated. Unbound ligand and ligand bound to cell surface receptors were removed using an acidic wash procedure (21Presky D.H. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 714-721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the number of remaining surface SST binding sites was determined by incubation with 100 pm[125I-Tyr11]SST14 (specific activity, 2000 Ci/mmol, Amersham, Braunschweig, Germany) in growth medium on ice for 2 h, followed by four rapid washes with ice-cold PBS. Membranes were prepared from transfected HEK cells (22Nehring R. Meyerhof W. Richter D. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 939-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and the binding characteristics of wild-type and mutant SSTR3 were determined by saturation binding assays. The dissociation constants and the number of binding sites for [125I-Tyr11]SST14 were calculated by Scatchard analysis. For the measurement of cAMP accumulation, transfected cells were exposed to serum-free DMEM containing 500 μm isobutyl methylxanthine for 30 min at 37 °C. In desensitization experiments, SST14 was included in this incubation medium for the last 10 min. Medium was then replaced with the same medium containing forskolin (16 nm) with or without SST14 (10 nm). After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the medium was removed, and the cells were extracted overnight with 300 μl of 70% ethanol at −20 °C. Extracts were lyophilized using a SpeedVac, and the cAMP contents were determined using a commercially available cAMP radioimmunoassay kit (DuPont NEN) which relies on the competition of cAMP for the binding of 125I-labeled succinyl cAMP tyrosine methylester to a cAMP-specific antibody. The assay was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Transfected cells were plated into six-well dishes 2 days before the experiment. After incubation for 1 h in serum-free, phosphate-free DMEM, cells were loaded with 50–100 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate (285 Ci/mg phosphate; ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) per well for 1 h in the same medium at 37 °C. SST14 was then added and incubation continued at 37 °C. Cells were then washed three times with cold PBS and lyzed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). After centrifugation at 15,800 × g for 30 min, the lysate was precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) at room temperature for 2 h.32P-Labeled receptor protein was then immunoprecipitated using 10 μg of anti-T7-tag antibody and 150 μl of protein A-Sepharose. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed five times with radioimmune precipitation buffer, and denatured with SDS sample buffer at 60 °C for 10 min. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the phosphorylated receptor was visualized by autoradiography. For the measurement of the stoichiometry of receptor phosphorylation, the receptor was detected by Western blotting using the T7 antibody as a primary antibody and alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat-anti mouse as the secondary antibody. The amount of immunoreactive material in each lane was quantified by densitometric analysis of the SSTR3-specific bands at 76 kDa using the NIH Image software (developed at the United States National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet athttp://rsb.info.nih.gov./nih-image/). A standard curve for the amount of T7-immunoreactive material was generated by simultaneous Western blot analysis of various amounts of the T7-positive control extract, which contains the T7 major capsid protein and is supplied by the manufacturer of the T7 antibody (Novagen, Madison, WI). The receptor-associated radioactivity was quantified on the Western blots using a PhosphorImager. Band intensities were plotted against a calibration curve obtained by spotting various amounts of32P on nitrocellulose. The specific radioactivity of the cellular ATP pool was determined as described previously (23Richardson R.M. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22249-22255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were subjected to high performance liquid chromatography (Applied Biosystems 130A) using an AX300 ion exchange column (Applied Biosystems). After sample injection and equilibration of the column in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 10 min, the ATP was eluted in the same buffer using a gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl in 45 min. The peak corresponding to ATP was collected, and its radioactivity content was determined by liquid scintillation counting. To determine the concentration of total cellular ATP, the peak height was plotted against a standard curve obtained by injecting various amounts of ATP. The specific activity of [γ-32P]ATP was 50 cpm/pmol ATP, which corresponds well to previously published data (6Pippig S. Alexander S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar, 23Richardson R.M. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22249-22255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of HEK cells expressing SSTR3 with 1 μm SST14 leads to a rapid reduction in the number of cell surface SST14 binding sites. By site-directed mutagenesis we have previously identified four hydroxyl amino acid residues in the receptor C terminus which are essential for internalization (12Roth A. Kreienkamp H.-J. Nehring R. Meyerhof W. Richter D. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1996; 22: 1298Google Scholar, 13Roth A. Kreienkamp H.-J. Nehring R. Roostermann D. Meyerhof W. Richter D. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here we show that each of these residues (Ser341, Ser346, Ser351, Thr357; see TableI) has a significant effect on the rate and extent of receptor internalization when compared with the wild-type receptor (Fig. 1). The S341A and S346A mutations still allowed some agonist-dependent loss of cell surface binding sites, while the S351A and T357A mutants showed little if any reduction over the entire time period (Fig. 1). Also the triple mutant S341A/S346A/S351A containing all three serine to alanine substitutions showed no reduction in the number of cell surface binding sites (data not shown). None of the mutations analyzed interfered with either ligand binding or functional expression of the receptor in HEK 293 cells; both the T357A and the triple serine mutants showed similar expression levels and agonist binding affinities as the wild-type receptor (Table I).Table ISite-directed mutations of the SSTR3 C-terminal tail 330340350360370 ∣∣∣∣∣SSTR3--YRFKQGFRRILLRPSRRVRSQEPGSGPPEKTEEEEDEEEEERREEEERRM 380390400410420 ∣∣∣∣∣ QRGQEMNGRLSQIAQPGPSGQQQRPCTGTAKEQQLLPQEATAGDKASTLSHLConstructK DB maxIC50Reduction of forskolin stimulated cAMP levels by 10 nm SST 14pmpmol/mgnm%SSTR358933.75662 ± 5T357A512.519.50758.5 ± 14S341A/S346A/S351A47819.255.568 ± 12Top, amino acid sequence of the intracellular C-terminal tail of SSTR3.

The effect of 10 nm SST14 on forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Values shown are the mean ± S.D. from two to four experiments performed in triplicate. We determined if prolonged treatment of SSTR3 expressing cells reduces the efficiency of coupling of this receptor to second-messenger systems. SSTR3 is coupled to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase via pertussis toxin sensitive G proteins (24Yasuda K. Rens-Domiano S. Breder C.D. Law S.F. Saper C.B. Reisine T. Bell G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20422-20428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At a concentration of 10 nm, SST14 reduced the forskolin-stimulated accumulation of cAMP in SSTR3 expressing HEK cells by 62 ± 5% (Table I). To determine a functional desensitization of SSTR3, cells were preincubated with SST14 prior to coincubation of SST14 and forskolin. Desensitization was manifested by a reduction of the SST14 effect on cAMP levels seen in the absence of preincubation, i.e. by a relative increase in cAMP accumulation. Preincubation of cells expressing SSTR3 with increasing concentrations of the ligand reduced the SST14-mediated effect on cAMP levels. Maximum desensitization was observed at a preincubation concentration of 30 nm SST14 (Fig. 2 A). Concentrations of SST14 higher than 100 nm did not yield reproducible results, presumably because large amounts of agonist could not be properly washed out after the preincubation, and the residual SST14 raised the concentration of agonist used in the coincubation with forskolin. The triple serine mutant did couple to the adenylate cyclase system with a similar efficiency as the wild-type receptor (Table I). However, in contrast to the wild-type SSTR3, the inhibition of adenylate cyclase could not be diminished by preincubation with up to 100 nmSST14. Thus, this mutant did not exhibit any sign of functional desensitization (Fig. 2 A). As functional desensitization and internalization of SSTR3 could both be blocked by mutating the three serine residues, removal of receptors from the cell surface could be one possible mechanism of desensitization. Therefore, we investigated if the two phenomena could be biochemically separated by comparing their concentration dependence. While desensitization appeared to reach a maximum at a concentration of 30 nm present during the 10-min preincubation step (see above), internalization required a 30–60-min preincubation (see also Fig. 1) to attain maximum level and did not saturate even at a concentration of 1 μm SST14 (Fig. 2 B). Thus, desensitization and internalization appear to be separate events that occur sequentially. As hydroxyl amino acids appeared to be involved in the internalization process, we investigated if the receptor undergoes agonist-dependent phosphorylation as an initial step in endocytosis. For this purpose, receptor expressing cells were loaded with [32P]orthophosphate, and the agonist-dependent receptor phosphorylation was determined by immunoprecipitation of receptors from cell lysates using an antibody directed against the T7 epitope tag, followed by SDS-gel electrophoresis. Fig. 3 shows that the wild-type SSTR3 exhibits a basal level of phosphorylation, and that this level is markedly increased by treatment with 1 μm SST14. Analysis of the concentration dependence and time course of SSTR3 phosphorylation reveals that a significant increase in receptor phosphorylation is observed after treatment with 1 nm SST14 for 30 min; the effect reaches its maximum at a concentration of 100 nm SST14 and is slightly reduced at 1 μmSST14 (Fig. 3 A). Increased phosphorylation can be observed after 5 min of agonist treatment and remains unaltered after 30 min of stimulation with 1 μm SST14 (Fig. 3 B). After 60 min of treatment with agonist, however, we observed a decrease in the phosphorylation level that might be due to the internalization of the receptor into the endocytotic compartment and the subsequent action of receptor-specific phosphatases that have been shown to be present in the endocytotic compartment (25Pitcher J.A. Payne E.S. Csortos C. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Quantification of the receptor-associated radioactivity indicates that the basal level of receptor phosphorylation is 0.77 mol of phosphate per mol of receptor. This level is increased to 2.31 mol/mol by treatment with 1 μm SST14 for 30 min (Fig.4, TableII)Table IIStoichiometry of basal and agonist-induced phosphorylation of SSTR3 and its mutantsSST14SSTR3mol P/molWild type−0.77 ± 0.13+2.31 ± 0.27T357A−0.44 ± 0.05+1.07 ± 0.03Triple−0.02 ± 0.02+0.34 ± 0.05The data were obtained by densitometric and PhosphorImager analysis of immunoprecipitated receptors as presented in Fig. 4. Open table in a new tab The data were obtained by densitometric and PhosphorImager analysis of immunoprecipitated receptors as presented in Fig. 4. Comparison of the T357A and triple serine (S341A/S346A/S351A) mutant receptors with the wild-type SSTR3 revealed that the T357A mutant exhibited a reduced level of basal phosphorylation (0.44 mol/mol), as well as a reduction in the increase of receptor-associated phosphate induced by 30 min of stimulation with 1 μm SST14 (1.07 mol/mol). In the case of the triple mutant, little or no basal phosphorylation of the receptor could be detected, and the increase after agonist treatment was also very small (0.34 mol/mol, Fig. 4 and Table II) when compared with the wild-type SSTR3. Thus our data indicate that phosphorylation of SSTR3, in the absence of agonist as well as in the presence of agonist, occurs at the four hydroxyl amino acids Ser341, Ser346, Ser351, and Thr357. To define the endocytotic pathway used by SSTR3, we attempted to colocalize the receptor with FITC-labeled transferrin. This apoprotein is known to be endocytosed together with the transferrin receptor via clathrin-coated pits into endosomes (26Dautry-Varsat A. Chiechanover A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2258-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Before treatment of HEK cells expressing SSTR3 with SST14, receptor-specific immunofluorescence was localized exclusively to the cell surface by confocal microscopy (Fig.5 A). After treatment with SST14 and FITC-labeled transferrin, the tagged SSTR3 (Fig.5 B) and transferrin (Fig. 5 C) using red (cy3) and green (FITC) fluorescence, respectively, were both found in numerous intracellular vesicle-like structures. After merging the two pictures, the yellow-orange signal (Fig. 5 D) indicates extensive colocalization of SSTR3 and transferrin in the same intracellular compartments. After internalization and subsequent washout of the agonist, fluorescence for SSTR3 returns to the cell surface of transfected HEK cells (Fig.6 A). We investigated if this reappearance is due to de novo synthesis of receptors or to recycling of the receptors from the endosomal compartment to the cell surface. Cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, did not prevent the reappearance of receptors at the cell surface. In contrast, brefeldin A, an inhibitor of the assembly of the Golgi apparatus, did prevent this process (Fig. 6 A). Our findings are supported by the biochemical measurement of cell surface receptors in these cells. These data show that SST14 binding sites start to reappear at the cell surface within 10 min of the removal of agonist. Again this process could not be blocked by cycloheximide (Fig. 6 B), suggesting that the SSTR3 is recycled after internalization. Previous evidence from other GPCRs has suggested that the main route for internalization is via clathrin coated pits and vesicles into endosomes, a pathway which is also used by the transferrin receptor and its ligand. For the β2-adrenergic receptor, phosphorylation of a cluster of hydroxyl amino acids in the C terminus of the protein is essential for desensitization and internalization (1Hausdorff W.P.

The intracellular protein β-arrestin binds to the phosphorylated receptor and functions as an adaptor between the receptor and the clathrin molecules of clathrin coated pits (4Goodman O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Kenn J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). It is controversial whether all GPCRs are internalized in this way, and recently Zhanget al. (27Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. G Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) have provided evidence that an alternative pathway exists for the angiotensin II type 1a receptor. The colocalization of the internalized SSTR3 with FITC-labeled transferrin shown in this study provides evidence that SSTR3 is internalized into early endosomes via a clathrin-dependent pathway (26Dautry-Varsat A. Chiechanover A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2258-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Endocytosis of SSTR3 can also be inhibited by phenylarsine oxide (13Roth A. Kreienkamp H.-J. Nehring R. Roostermann D. Meyerhof W. Richter D. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), a reagent which has been used as a specific inhibitor of clathrin-dependent endocytosis (5Grady E.F. Slice L.W. Brant W.O. Walsh J.H. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4603-4611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, the question arose whether SSTR3, like the β2-adrenergic receptor, undergoes phosphorylation at specific hydroxyl residues in the C terminus, which would facilitate binding of β-arrestin and subsequent targeting to the endocytotic machinery. Our mutational analysis of SSTR3 clearly shows that four hydroxyl amino acids in the receptor C terminus are necessary for internalization, suggesting that they are targets for agonist-dependent phosphorylation. An unexpected finding was that each individual serine and the threonine residue, when mutated to alanine, has a severe effect on the rate and extent of receptor internalization. It has become clear that most GPCRs can be phosphorylated at multiple intracellular residues (e.g. see Gurevich et al. (28Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne- Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar)), but in most cases it is unknown whether all of these residues are required for either desensitization or internalization. Our in vitro phosphorylation experiments show that SSTR3 is indeed phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent manner. The receptor exhibits significant basal phosphorylation at a level of 0.77 mol of phosphate per mol receptor, and the extent of phosphorylation can be increased more than 2–3-fold by treatment with 1 μm SST14. The T357A mutant shows a significant decrease in the basal as well as in the agonist-induced phosphorylation. This effect is even more pronounced in a triple mutant in which all three serine residues were replaced by alanines. Here basal phosporylation of the receptor becomes undetectable. Thus all four hydroxyl residues identified here contribute to the basal as well as to the agonist-induced phosphorylation of SSTR3. In our experiments we did not observe the “ideal” number of 4 mol of phosphate per mol of receptor, but this may be expected as only 60–70% of the receptors are internalized after treatment with agonist for 30 min (Fig. 1). The other cell surface receptors may not be functionally coupled to G proteins and thus not be available as a substrate for receptor kinases. It should also be noted that the extent of the agonist induced phosphorylation of the wild-type receptor is probably underestimated in these experiments, because the population of internalized receptors is exposed to Ser/Thr-phosphatases which are present in endosomal fractions of the cell (25Pitcher J.A. Payne E.S. Csortos C. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and which have been implicated in the resensitization of GPCRs after desensitization/internalization (6Pippig S. Alexander S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar, 25Pitcher J.A. Payne E.S. Csortos C. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This is particularly evident in our experiments when long incubation times and/or high concentrations of agonist were used; this led to more extensive internalization of the receptor. The observed increase in SSTR3 phosphorylation was slightly reduced in these cases. Taken together, our data are compatible with a model in which all four residues need to be phosphorylated to induce internalization. One or more of these residues may be phosporylated in the resting state, but this is not sufficient to induce desensitization and internalization. Second-messenger activated kinases have been implicated in the desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors. Out of the four hydroxyl amino acid residues identified here, only Ser346fits the consensus sequence of the multifunctional calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Therefore it is likely that phosphorylation of the SSTR3 C terminus is brought about by one of the GPCR-specific kinases, which recognizes a rather broad spectrum of sequences (29Palczewski K. Benovic J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 387-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Earlier work has shown that stimulation of S49 cells with somatostatin leads to translocation of a GPCR-specific kinase to the membrane (30Mayor Jr., F. Benovic J.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol Chem. 1987; 262: 6468-6471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When assayed for its ability to inhibit adenylate cyclase, SSTR3 functionally desensitizes even after treatment with low concentrations of agonists. In contrast, the triple mutant receptor, while fully functional in this assay, shows no sign of desensitization even when preincubated with SST14 at concentrations of up to 100 nm. As mutation of these residues affects desensitization and internalization, one might speculate that removal of receptors from the cell surface is the actual mechanism of functional desensitization. However, this is not the case, as the concentration dependence of the two processes is different. It has previously been shown for other GPCRs that desensitization and internalization can be biochemically separated (6Pippig S. Alexander S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar, 31Ng G.Y.K. Trogadis J. Stevens J. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10157-10161Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that SSTR phosphorylation at the four hydroxyl amino acids leads to uncoupling of the receptor from G proteins. This functional desensitization precedes endocytosis of the receptor. As endocytosis involves the same intracellular pathway used by the β2-adrenergic receptor, it appears likely that this process is brought about by the binding of β-arrestin to the phosphorylated receptor. However, it remains to be shown whether the isoforms of β-arrestin can actually bind to SSTR3 or whether other adaptors exist which can target GPCRs to the endocytotic pathway. For the β2-adrenergic receptor it has been shown that endocytosis is necessary for the resensitization of the receptor after functional desensitization (6Pippig S. Alexander S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar). Our experiments indicate that SSTR3 is regulated similarly, as it efficiently recycles to the cell surface after internalization and subsequent removal of the agonist. Phosphate groups are removed from the receptor C terminus in an endosomal compartment, as observed here under conditions of extensive internalization (see above), and the acidic environment of the endosome favors dissociation of SST14 from its receptor (21Presky D.H. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 714-721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the receptor returns to the cell surface in a functional state.

In this work we obtained a spontaneous revertant whose UDP-glucose level lies between those found in the wild type and the mutant cell. The activity of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UDPG:PP), the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of UDP-glucose, was in the mutant 4% and in the revertant 56% of the activity found in the wild type cell. Sequence analysis of UDPG: PP cDNAs from the mutant cell showed one missense mutation, which changes amino acid residue 115 from glycine to aspartic acid. The substituted glycine is located within the largest stretch of strictly conserved residues among eukaryotic UDPG:PPs. The analysis of the cDNAs from the revertant cell indicated the presence of an equimolar mixture of the wild type and the mutated mRNAs, suggesting that the mutation has reverted in only one of the alleles. In summary, we demonstrate that the G115D substitution in the Chinese hamster UDPG:PP dramatically impairs its enzymatic activity, thereby causing cellular UDP-glucose deficiency.

Don Q was obtained after mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate of wild type Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (referred to here as Don wt) and selection for resistance toClostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB) (23Florin I. Microb. Pathogen. 1991; 11: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This cytotoxin produces collapse of the actin cytoskeleton via a glucosylation of the small GTPases Rho, Rac, and CDC42, which are members of the Ras superfamily (25Just I. Selzer J.

Boquet P. Sauerborn M. Thelestam M. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The synthesis of UDP-Glc (and other UDP-hexoses) depends on the amount of glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) and UTP available in the cell (see Fig. 1). Two enzymes are needed for UDP-Glc synthesis: phosphoglucomutase (EC 5.4.2.2), which interconverts Glc-6-P and glucose-1-phosphate (Glc-1-P), and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UDPG:PP; EC 2.7.7.9), which catalyzes the formation of UDP-Glc from UTP and Glc-1-P (see Fig. 1). Because the reaction catalyzed by UDPG:PP is near equilibrium (29Roach P.J. Warren K.R. Atkinson D.E. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5445-5450Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 30Lunn J.E. Rees T.

The aim of this work was to clarify the reason for the UDP-Glc deficiency in Don Q. A mutant cell denoted as CdtRQ (23Florin I. Microb.

Cells were cultivated at 37 °C in Eagle's medium (Flow Laboratories, Irvine, Scotland) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a humid atmosphere containing 5% CO2. After 2 days, when the cells had grown to confluent monolayers,C. perfringens phospholipase C (PLC) (32Möllby R. Thelestam M. Wadström T. J. Membr.

Papapoulos S.E. van der Pluijm G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated for 2 h with 200 μl/well of neutral red (Sigma) (50 μg/ml) dissolved in culture medium supplemented as above. The incorporated dye was extracted from the cells with 100 μl of acetic acid:ethanol:water (1:50:49), before reading at 540 nm in a microtiter plate reader. All experiments were performed at least three times, with six replicate samples in each experiment. The uptake of 2-deoxy-d-[6-3H]-glucose was measured essentially as described (37Sasson S. Cerasi E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16827-16833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultivated in 96-well plates, rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated with 2-deoxy-d-[6-3H]-glucose (2 μCi/ml) (Amersham Corp.) in glucose-free medium with or without cytochalasin B (Sigma) (5 μg/ml). After 5, 10, 20, 25, and 35 min at 37 °C, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed in situ by incubation with 10 μl of 0.4% SDS for 10 min. Scintillation mixture (190 μl) (Hisafe, Wallac) was added, and the radioactivity in the wells was counted in a microtiter plate β-counter. The specific uptake was calculated as the difference between uptake in the absence and in the presence of cytochalasin B (37Sasson S. Cerasi E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16827-16833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and related to the amount of cellular protein. Cells in parallel wells were lysed, and the amount of protein was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. All experiments were performed at least three times, with six replicate samples in each experiment. The metabolites were extracted from confluent monolayers of three 75-cm2 cell culture flasks (Nunc) of each cell line using a dual-phase extraction method (38Tyagi K.R. Azrad A. Degani H. Salomon Y. Magn. Reson. Med. 1996; 35: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The methanol-water phase was freeze-dried and resuspended in a buffer with 8 mm Na2HPO4 and 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2 (prepared with D2O). The acquisition of the spectra was done as described elsewhere (39Pollesello P. Eriksson O. Vittur F. Paoletti S. Geimonen E. Toffanin R. NMR Biomed. 1995; 8: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The chemical shifts were referred to 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid (0 ppm). UDP-Glc, UDP-GlcUA, UDP-Gal, Gal-1-P, and Glc-1-P were quantified by integration of the double doublets assigned to the protons of the anomeric carbon centered at 5.636, 5.618, 5.601, 5.493, and 5.453 ppm, respectively. UTP was quantified by integration of the doublet assigned to the meta-uracylic proton centered at 7.975 ppm, whereas Glc-6-P was quantified by integration of the doublet assigned to the proton of the anomeric carbon centered at 5.250 ppm. The amount of each metabolite was related to the amount of cellular protein determined in lysates from parallel flasks. All experiments were performed at least twice. The activity of UDPG:PP was measured essentially as described (40Hames B.D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 73: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cell monolayers, one 75-cm2 flask of each cell line, were washed twice with PBS and mechanically removed. Cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer (0.08 mTricine-HCl, 0.03% Triton X-100, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Boehringer Mannheim Scandinavia AB, Bromma, Sweden), pH 7.4)). Protein concentration in cell lysates was determined as above. Cell lysates (1–20 μg protein) were incubated with UTP (Sigma) (5 mm) and [14C]-Glc-1-P (302 mCi/mmol) (Amersham Corp.) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by heating to 100 °C for 2 min. Residual [14C]-Glc-1-P was removed by incubation with 0.5 units of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) at 45 °C for 30 min. An aqueous suspension of charcoal (20 mg/ml) was added to absorb the UDP-[14C]-Glc formed, and after 10 min the charcoal was washed three times with water. Finally, the charcoal pellets were extracted with 90 μl of acetic acid (10%), and 2 ml of scintillation mixture was added before counting. All experiments were performed at least twice, with three replicate samples in each experiment. Total RNAs from Don wt, Q, and QR cells were isolated using the RNeasy kit from Qiagen GmbH (Hilden, Germany), and the concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically as absorbance at 260 nm. Reverse transcription was performed as follows: 1.5 μg of the purified RNA was incubated with 2 μl of oligo(dT) (50 μm) (the volume was adjusted to 10 μl with distilled water) at 70 °C for 5 min and then chilled on ice. Then 1 μl of avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (24 U/μl) (Seikagaku America Inc., Ijamsville, MD), 4 μl of dNTP (2.5 mm), 0.5 unit of ribonuclease inhibitor (40 units/μl) (Boehringer), and 2 μl of 10 × reverse transcriptase-first strand buffer were added, and the volume was adjusted to 20 μl with distilled water. After heating the reaction mixture to 95 °C for 5 min and incubation for 60 min at 40 °C, the resulting cDNAs were stored at −20 °C until use. Primers (5′-TCGGAGGAGAAAGAACACAT-3′ and 5′-AGGCAATCAAAGACCATCAC-3′) to amplify a 1913-base pair fragment that encompasses the complete coding region of UDPG:PP were designed according to the human UDPG:PP cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number L14430; Ref. 58Peng H.L. Chang H.Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PCR was performed with 3 μl of cDNA, 4 μl of dNTPs (2.5 mm), 3 μl of each primer (10 μm), 2.5 μl of Dynazyme (2 units/μl) (Finnzymes Oy, Espoo, Finland), and 5 μl of Dynazyme buffer (10×), the volume being adjusted to 50 μl with distilled water. After 3 min at 95 °C, the mixture was incubated for 27 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. For semiquantitative RT-PCR, a 648-base pair fragment was amplified for 20 cycles using the primers 5′-TAGAAGAAGGCAAAGAGTAT-3′ and 5′-TCCAGAAACAGTGAGGTGAT-3′, which were designed according to the sequence of the human UDPG:PP cDNA. For Northern blot analysis the DNA fragment of the Chinese hamster UDPG:PP used as a probe was obtained by PCR amplification with the same primers used for semiquantitative RT-PCR. The fragment was run on a 1% low melting temperature agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, excised under UV transillumination, and purified using the BandPret kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The purified fragment was then labeled with [α-32P]CTP using the kit Ready to go (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples containing 20 μg of total RNA from each cell line were denatured, run on low formaldehyde (2.5% v/v) agarose gels, and blotted onto a positively charged nylon membrane (Pharmacia) by capillary transfer, using 10 × SSC as transfer buffer. The membrane was cross-linked by 1-min exposure to low wavelength UV, and prehybridizations were performed for 1–2 h at 55 °C in Rapy-hyb buffer (Amersham Corp.). Hybridizations were performed at 55 °C for 18–20 h as described (41Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. 2nd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.39-7.52Google Scholar). The membrane was washed three times in 1 × SSC/1% SDS for 20 min at room temperature. Hybrid bands were detected using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), and radioactivity was quantified using the Image Quant Program (Molecular Dynamics Inc.). For Western blot analysis confluent cell monolayers were washed twice with PBS and mechanically removed. Cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of 0.4% SDS containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Protein concentration in cell lysates was determined as above. Cell lysates (30 μg protein/lane) were submitted to electrophoresis under reducing conditions on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) (10% w/v), and separated proteins were electroblotted (43Towbin H. Staehelin T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) on to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The nitrocellulose membrane was saturated with 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Nonidet P40 in PBS (blocking solution) for 2 h at room temperature before a 2-h incubation with rabbit antibodies against potato UDPG:PP in blocking solution. Unbound antibodies were removed by washing four times (5–10 min each) with blocking solution before incubation with an anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline-phosphatase conjugate (Dako A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) for 2 h at room temperature. The nitrocellulose membrane was washed as described above and incubated with nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma) (250 μg/ml) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Sigma) (56 μg/ml) in 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5. Immunoreactive bands were detected using a densitometer and quantified using the Image Quant Program. The PCR-amplified products were purified as described above. Sequence analysis was performed on the GeneAmp PCR System 9600 using the Applied Biosystems Prism™ dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems Division, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 10–30 ng/μl (3–6 μl) of the gel-purified PCR product were added to a MicroAmp™ reaction tube (Perkin-Elmer) containing 3.2 pmol of sequencing primer, 8.0 μl of premixture (containing buffer, dNTPs, dye-labeled ddNTPs and AmpliTaq), and distilled water to a final volume of 20 μl. After the initial denaturation at 96 °C for 2 min, the reaction mixture was incubated for 25 cycles at 96 °C for 10 s, 50 °C for 5 s, and 60 °C for 4 min. Sequence analysis was performed on both strands. The sequencing primers were designed according to the sequence of the human UDPG:PP cDNA. For the coding strand they were: 5′-CTTACACCAATCAGACTTTT-3′, 5′-ATTAAAACAAGAGGGACATC-3′, 5′-ATACTCTTTGCCTTCTTCTA-3′, 5′-TCAGGCCTCCATCCAAAGTC-3′, 5′-TCCAGAAACAGTGAGGTGAT-3′, and 5′-AGGCAATCAAAGACCATCAC-3′. For the noncoding strand they were: 5′-TCGGAGGAGAAAGAACACAT-3′, 5′-TTACAACAGCAACCTCACAT-3′, 5′-CAAAAGCTACAATACAGATG-3′, 5′-TAGAAGAAGGCAAAGAGTAT-3′, 5′-GAGTCGTTTTCTGCCTGTGA-3′, and 5′-GGGAACAGTTATCATTATTG-3′. The extension products were purified by ethanol precipitation and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure (SpeedVac®, Savant Instruments, Holbrook, NY). Each sample was resuspended in 4 μl of loading buffer (5:1 deionized formamide/50 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), heated for 2 min at 90 °C, and loaded onto a model 373A Sequencer (PE/ABI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequence analysis of both strands was performed at least twice for each cell line. A multiple sequence alignment was performed using the program Clustal W (44Desmond G.H. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Secondary structure elements were predicted (45Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar) and summarized for each alignment position. Hydropathy plots were calculated using a sliding 6-residue window (46Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar). Motifs (47Bork P. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) were defined as regions with at least 11 strictly conserved residues among 30 consecutive positions. The molecular modelling and picture of the model were made with the ICM program (version 2.6, 1996, Molsoft, Metuchen, NJ). Don Q is 104 times more resistant to the TcdB-induced cytopathogenic effect and 105 times more sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of PLC than Don wt (23Florin I. Microb. Pathogen. 1991; 11: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). By culturing Don Q in the presence of PLC, we isolated a revertant cell, Don QR, which has regained the sensitivity to TcdB and the relative resistance to PLC displayed by Don wt (Fig.2 A and data not shown). Because Don Q has a deficiency of UDP-Glc, a metabolite required for the entry of galactose into glycolysis (Fig.1), we compared the ability of the three cell lines to grow on galactose as the only energy source. Don QR grew almost equally well as Don wt, whereas Don Q was not able to survive under this condition (not shown). The regained TcdB sensitivity of Don QR and its capacity to metabolize galactose indicated that the UDP-Glc deficiency in Don Q was at least partially compensated in Don QR. In this work we used the cell lines Don wt, Q, and QR to determine the reason for the low UDP-Glc level in Don Q. To determine whether Don Q has a general deficiency in UDP-hexoses, its sensitivity to C. novyi α-toxin was studied. This toxin catalyzes the incorporation of GlcNAc into Rho subfamily proteins using UDP-N-acetylglucosamine as a cofactor (48Selzer J. Hofmann F. Rex G. Wilm M. Mann M. Just I. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25173-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The three cell lines showed the same dose response for development of the α-toxin-induced cytopathogenic effect (Fig.2 B). Because Don Q was not more resistant to α-toxin, the low level of UDP-Glc in this cell appears not to be associated with a general deficiency in UDP-hexoses. This result also implies that Don Q does not have a UTP deficiency, because this metabolite is a precursor for the synthesis of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (Fig. 1). The facilitated diffusion of glucose across the plasma membrane is a limiting step in the synthesis of UDP-Glc and glycogen (49Buse M.G. Robinson K.A. Marshall B.A. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23197-23202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 50Gulve E.A. Ren J.-M. Marshall B.A. Gao J. Hansen P.A. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol.

The 2-deoxyglucose uptake in Don Q and Don wt was the same, whereas in Don QR it was slightly increased. This result indicated that the low level of UDP-Glc in Don Q is not due to a defective glucose uptake. The cellular levels of the metabolites of the UDP-hexose pathways in the three cell lines were measured by 1H NMR spectroscopy (TableI). The UDP-Glc level in Don Q was 26% of that in Don wt, in agreement with our previous measurement using reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (24Chaves-Olarte E. Florin I. Boquet P. Popoff M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Thelestam M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6925-6932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Don QR was found to have a UDP-Glc level of 64% of that found in Don wt. This result indicated that the UDP-Glc deficiency of Don Q has been only partially compensated in Don QR. In agreement with this, the level of UDP-GlcUA in Don QR lay between those of Don wt and Don Q (TableI).Table ILevels of glucose metabolites in Don wt, Q, and QR cellsMetaboliteConcentrationDon wtDon QDon QRnmol/mg proteinUDP-Glc5.01.33.2UDP-GlcUA1.20.20.5Gal-1-P1.24.00.8UDP-Gal2.51.02.1Glc-6-P1-aQuantified together with traces of glucose.130.0126.0123.0Glc-1-P0.85.20.7UTP3.93.84.0Metabolites from the three cell lines were extracted and 1H NMR spectra were obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Protein concentrations were determined in parallel flasks.

The assignments of the proton on the anomeric carbon of UDP-Gal and Gal-1-P to double doublets in the region from 5.7 to 5.4 ppm of the the1H NMR spectra were performed for the first time (Fig.4 A). Don Q has the highest level of Gal-1-P and the lowest level of UDP-Gal compared with Don wt and QR (Table I), indicating an impaired capacity to interconvert these metabolites. The low UDP-Glc level in Don Q explains this impairment, because UDP-Glc is a required cofactor for this interconversion (Fig.1). When glucose is incorporated into a cell, it is immediately phosphorylated to Glc-6-P by hexokinases (52Seoane J. Gómez-Foix A.M. O'Doherty R.M. Gómez-Ara C. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol.

The three cell lines showed similar levels of Glc-6-P (Table I), indicating that the synthesis of this metabolite is not impaired in Don Q. Normally, the cellular level of UDP-Glc reflects the concentration of Glc-6-P (52Seoane J. Gómez-Foix A.M. O'Doherty R.M. Gómez-Ara C. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2053110961,"We have examined whether the low affinity neurotrophin receptor p75NTR modulates TrkA function by intracellular signaling. Using ligands that selectively bind p75NTR or TrkA, we found that a p75NTR-derived signal reduces TrkA activation. Short term treatment of PC12 cells with ceramide analogues also resulted in reduced NGF-stimulated TrkA activation, suggesting that p75-mediated increases in sphingomyelinase activity may contribute to this modulatory effect. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed to determine if brain-derived neurotrophic factor- or ceramide-mediated phosphorylation of the TrkA intracellular domain correlated with a reduction in its ligand-induced activation. A specific increase in TrkA phosphoserine content was observed in response to both C2-ceramide and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. These results suggest that ligand binding of p75NTR can activate a signaling cascade that results in reduced TrkA activity through phosphorylation of its intracellular domain.

Highly related transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases, termed Trk receptors, recognize the neurotrophins with a relatively high degree of binding specificity, with TrkA preferentially binding NGF, TrkB preferring BDNF 1The abbreviations used are: BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; NGF, nerve growth factor; NGF3T, nerve growth factor triple mutant; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TNFR, TNF receptor. and neurotrophin-4/5, and TrkC interacting only with neurotrophin-3 (reviewed in Refs. 8Bazan J.F. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 603-606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar and9Barker P.A. Barbee G. Misko T.P. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30645-30650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other class of neurotrophin receptor contains only one member, termed p75NTR. This receptor is a member of TNF receptor superfamily that also includes CD27, CD30, CD40, 4–1BB, OX40, the Fas antigen, and the tumor necrosis factor receptors TNFR1 and TNFR2 (reviewed in Ref.8Bazan J.F. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 603-606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The physiological role of the p75NTR has proven elusive, but recent data support at least two functions. First, p75NTR functionally interacts with TrkA to enhance neurotrophin responsiveness, particularly at low ligand concentrations (9Barker P.A. Barbee G. Misko T.P. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30645-30650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hantzopoulos P.A. Suri C. Glass D.J. Goldfarb M.P. Yancopoulos G.D.

Neuron. 1994; 12: 733-745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). p75NTR appears to mediate this effect in part by increasing the amount of NGF that becomes bound to the TrkA receptor (12Barker P.A. Shooter E.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 203-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 13Mahadeo D. Kaplan L. Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6884-6891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, recent studies suggest that the p75NTR may play an autonomous signaling role. Neurotrophin binding to p75NTR results in sphingomyelinase activation and ceramide production (14Dobrowsky R.T. Werner M.H. Castellino A.M. Chao M.V. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1596-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 15Dobrowsky R.T. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22135-22142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and recent reports suggest that NGF binding to p75 produces activation of the NF-kB transcriptional complex (16Carter B.D. Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Offenhauser N. Bohmmatthaei R. Baeuerle P.A. Barde Y.A. Science. 1996; 272: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) as well as a stimulation of Jun kinase (17Braccilaudiero L. Aloe L. Stenfors C. Tirassa P. Theodorsson E. Lundberg T. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 485-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These results indicate that p75NTR may be functionally grouped with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily, such as TNFR1 and Fas. Previous analyses of p75NTR-TrkA interactions have focused on ligand binding events that might account for modulation of receptor function. In this report, we tested the hypothesis that a p75NTR-activated signaling mechanism alters TrkA function. Using receptor-selective ligands, we found that BDNF binding to p75NTR results in a strong attenuation of TrkA signaling. TrkA signaling was also reduced following a short exposure to ceramide, suggesting that ceramide production which results from p75NTR activation may be responsible for this effect. To test if the reduction in TrkA signaling correlated with serine or threonine phosphorylation of the TrkA intracellular domain, TrkA was subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis; both BDNF and ceramide treatment were found to increase phosphoserine content. These findings indicate that ligand binding to p75NTR activates a ceramide-dependent signaling cascade that regulates TrkA activity through serine phosphorylation of the TrkA intracellular kinase domain. NGF was purchased from Collaborative Research, TNF was purchased from R & D Systems, and C2-ceramide and dihydrosphingosine were obtained from BioMol. BDNF was provided by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (Tarrytown, NY), the pan-Trk antibody 203 was a gift from David Kaplan (Montreal Neurological Institute), and NGF3T was prepared as described (12Barker P.A.

PC12 cells or MG139–2 cells were plated on 100-mm dishes and 24 h later were washed twice in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (DMEB) and then incubated in 5 ml of DMEB supplemented as described in the figure legends. Control incubations received appropriate vehicle control solutions. After induction, the medium was removed, and plates were placed on ice, rinsed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl), and then lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm orthovanadate). Lysates were normalized for protein content, incubated with 2 μl of rabbit pan-Trk antibody 203 overnight at 4 °C, supplemented with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose, and then incubated at 4 °C for 90 min. Beads were pelleted, washed three times in lysis buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Immunoprecipitates were separated on 10% Laemmli acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Phosphotyrosine blots were blocked in 10 mmTris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Tween 20, and primary and secondary antibody incubations were performed in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20. Blocking, primary (using antibody 203), and secondary (using protein A-conjugated horseradish peroxidase) incubations for TrkA immunoblots were all performed in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, and 5% (w/v) dry skim milk powder. Reactive bands on all immunoblots were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) according to the manufacturer's instructions (DuPont). PC12 cells were grown to confluence in 150-mm plates, washed once in serum-free medium, and then preincubated 2 h in phosphate-free DMEB containing 750 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate/ml. Cells were then supplemented with 11 × stock solutions made in phosphate-free DMEB to produce final NGF, BDNF, or C2-ceramide concentrations of 100 ng/ml, 200 ng/ml, and 100 μm, respectively. After a 30-min incubation, the medium was removed, and cells were washed once with Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Wash buffer was replaced with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm orthovanadate). Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g, and the supernatant was precleared with preimmune serum-coated protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4° C. The beads were removed by centrifugation, and TrkA was immunoprecipitated as described above. Immunoprecipitates were split into two aliquots that were both separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. One set of labeled lysates was analyzed for TrkA content by immunoblot as described above, and the other was exposed to XAR film to detect labeled TrkA protein. Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane fragments containing the labeled TrkA samples were cut from the transfer membrane and hydrolyzed under vacuum in 6 n HCl vapor for 2.5 h at 110° C. Phosphoamino acids were eluted from the membrane with H2O for 16 h then were concentrated in a Speed-Vac. Phosphoamino acids were separated using two-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis on a Hunter apparatus. Phosphoamino acid standards were visualized by spraying the plates with a solution of 0.2% ninhydrin in acetone (w/v), and 32P-labeled phosphoamino acids were identified by autoradiography. Quantitation of phosphoamino analysis was performed on scanned autroradiographs using NIH IMAGE. Signaling pathways originating from p75NTR and TrkA can be activated in PC12 cells (15Dobrowsky R.T.

We have previously shown that BDNF treatment of PC12 cells, which binds p75NTR but not TrkA, results in a dramatic reduction in TrkA receptor activation that is at least partially due to its ability to disrupt ligand transfer between p75NTR and TrkA (12Barker P.A. Shooter E.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 203-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). To test whether other mechanisms might also contribute to the effect of BDNF on TrkA activation, we have used ligands that selectively bind either TrkA or p75NTR. A mutant form of NGF (NGF3T) that does not bind p75NTR (21Ibanez C.F. Ebendal T. Barbany G. Murray-Rust J. Blundell T.L. Persson H. Cell. 1992; 69: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) was used to selectively activate TrkA and BDNF was used to selectively activate p75NTR. To determine if a p75NTR-derived signal may affect TrkA activation, PC12 cells were preincubated with various concentrations of BDNF for 3 h, exposed to NGF3T for 5 min, and then analyzed for TrkA tyrosine phosphorylation levels by immunoblotting (Fig.1 A). A clear reduction in NGF3T-stimulated TrkA tyrosine phosphorylation levels was observed in the presence of BDNF; densitometry reveals reductions of 53, 70, and 81% at BDNF concentrations of 50, 100, and 500 ng/ml, respectively. Direct TrkA immunoblotting showed that this decrease in phosphotyrosine signal did not reflect a reduction in TrkA protein levels because these were maintained throughout all treatment conditions (Fig.1 B). This effect of BDNF was rapid; a BDNF preincubation lasting 5 min (Fig. 1 C) produced effects on TrkA tyrosine phosphorylation similar to that observed using a 3-h preincubation (Fig. 1 A). To test if the BDNF-mediated reduction in TrkA tyrosine phosphorylation is reflected in downstream signaling events, NGF3T-stimulated c-fos mRNA accumulation was examined in the presence and the absence of BDNF. Fig. 2 Ashows that the robust increase in c-fos mRNA expression, which normally occurs in response to NGF3T, was reduced (by 71%) following BDNF treatment. We next considered the possibility that the effect of BDNF on TrkA activation and signaling could be due some direct interference with NGF3T binding. We have previously shown that BDNF does not directly interact with TrkA and does not interfere with the interaction of wild type NGF with TrkA (9Barker P.A. Barbee G. Misko T.P. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30645-30650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Barker P.A. Shooter E.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 203-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), but to ensure that BDNF has no effect on the interaction of TrkA with NGF3T, a mutant form of NGF, we examined the effect of BDNF on the activation of TrkA in fibroblasts that do not express p75NTR. Fig. 2 B shows that the NGF3T-mediated increase in TrkA tyrosine phosphorylation in these cells was unaffected by BDNF preincubation. Binding of BDNF to p75NTR on PC12 cells activates sphingomyelinase activity and results in the accumulation of intracellular ceramide (15Dobrowsky R.T. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22135-22142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To test if BDNF-mediated ceramide accumulation might mediate the reduction in TrkA activity, PC12 cells were pretreated with increasing concentrations of C2-ceramide, a cell-permeable ceramide analogue, and then supplemented with either NGF or NGF3T for 5 min and analyzed for Trk phosphotyrosine levels. Fig.3 A shows that C2-ceramide levels greater than 15 μm cause a profound reduction in the level of Trk tyrosine phosphorylation induced by NGF, similar to the effects observed with BDNF. Densitometry shows an average decrease in NGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of 61% at 20 μm C2-ceramide, 71% at 50 μm C2-ceramide, and 80% at 100 μm C2-ceramide. Very similar results were obtained when NGF3T was used in place of NGF (data not shown). Levels of TrkA protein remain unchanged under these conditions (Fig.3 B), indicating that C2-ceramide reduced the ability of TrkA to respond to NGF. To determine whether this represents a specific effect of ceramide or a nonspecific lipid effect, these experiments were repeated using dihydrosphingosine, the inactive saturated analog of C2-ceramide. Dihydrosphingosine had no effect on NGF-mediated TrkA activation (Fig. 3 C). Tyrosine kinase receptors are ligand-regulated transmembrane enzymes, but kinase activity of the intracellular domain is subject to intracellular regulation, with phosphorylation of key intracellular serine or threonine residues playing an important regulatory role (22Theroux S.J.

Volle D.J. Sanderson S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26259-26266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if BDNF or ceramide treatment results in alterations in the level of serine or threonine phosphorylation within the TrkA intracellular domain, we performed phosphoamino acid analysis of the TrkA receptor. PC12-6/24 cells, which overexpress the TrkA receptor, were grown in [32P]orthophosphate for 2 h, treated with NGF, BDNF, or C2-ceramide for 30 min, and then analyzed for phosphoamino acid content. Fig.4 shows that TrkA obtained from untreated cells contained low levels of phosphoserine, and as expected, TrkA from cells treated with NGF treatment contained abundant phosphotyrosine and also showed an increase in phosphoserine levels of about 50-fold. TrkA receptor from cells treated with either BDNF or C2-ceramide in the absence of NGF also showed a clear increase in phosphoserine content, with maximal increases in phosphoserine content approaching 12-fold with either reagent. These results indicate that the phosphorylation state of the TrkA intracellular domain is regulated by BDNF-activated signal and by ceramide and indicate that ligand-dependent activation of the TrkA receptor may be regulated by increased serine phosphorylation of its intracellular domain. p75NTR and TrkA have a complex functional interaction. TrkA activation is increased in cells coexpressing the two receptors compared with those expressing TrkA alone; at least part of this effect is due to a p75NTR-mediated increase in the amount of NGF that ultimately becomes bound to the TrkA receptor (9Barker P.A. Barbee G. Misko T.P. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30645-30650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Barker P.A. Shooter E.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6884-6891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly, whereas p75NTR increases the ability of TrkA to become activated by preferred ligands such as NGF, correlative evidence suggests that p75NTR reduces the ability of TrkA to become activated by nonpreferred ligands such as neurotrophin-3 and neurotrophin-4 (26Davies A.M.

In our studies, we have found that treatment of PC12 cells with BDNF results in a pronounced attenuation in subsequent signaling through TrkA. This effect of BDNF is not due to disruption of NGF binding to p75NTR, since the NGF3T mutant used in these experiments does not bind this receptor. Furthermore, BDNF does not interfere with NGF3T-mediated activation of TrkA on cells that do not express p75NTR, indicating that the effects observed on PC12 cells are not due to disruption of NGF3T binding to TrkA. Instead, these effects are most easily explained by a mechanism that involves BDNF binding to p75NTR and subsequent activation of a signaling cascade that regulates TrkA activity. Regulation of receptor activity by intracellular signaling paths can occur through a process termed receptor transmodulation. Selective phosphorylation of specific serine and threonine residues within the epidermal growth factor and insulin receptors results in a reduction in subsequent ligand-mediated receptor activity (22Theroux S.J.

The mechanisms controlling these regulatory events are not well understood, but recent analyses of the effect of TNF receptor activation on insulin receptor signaling has been revealing. TNF treatment results in a reduction in subsequent ligand-stimulated insulin receptor signaling, and recent reports have shown that this attenuation is due to TNF-induced serine and threonine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and its downstream tyrosine kinase signaling partner, IRS1. TNFR1 and TNFR2-mediated activation of sphingomyelinase activity and the subsequent accumulation of ceramide appear to be key components of this signaling cascade (32Kanety H. Feinstein R. Papa M.Z.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11222-11227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Because BDNF, acting through p75NTR, also stimulates sphingomyelinase activity within PC12 cells (15Dobrowsky R.T. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22135-22142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the BDNF-mediated attenuation in TrkA activation may likewise function through ceramide-dependent phosphorylation events. Consistent with this, we found that C2-ceramide, a cell-permeable ceramide analogue, mimics the effect of BDNF on TrkA activation and that BDNF and C2-ceramide lead to an increase in TrkA phosphoserine content. NGF treatment also results in a profound increase in TrkA phosphoserine, but p75-mediated activation of sphingomyelinase is apparently suppressed when TrkA is activated (15Dobrowsky R.T. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22135-22142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Therefore, NGF-dependent serine phosphorylation of TrkA is unlikely to be a ceramide-dependent event but may instead be an indirect consequence of TrkA activation. Comparing the specific TrkA phosphoserine residues phosphorylated in response to NGF with those phosphorylated by BDNF and C2-ceramide treatment will allow us to define the specific activities mediating these effects. We have not yet determined the mechanism by which BDNF and ceramide lead to an increase in TrkA phosphoserine content. BDNF and ceramide may activate cascades that result in activation of a regulated serine-directed kinase or could result in the stable association of some constitutively active kinase with TrkA. Alternatively, the increase in phosphoserine content observed in response to BDNF or ceramide treatment may reflect an induced dephosphorylation of TrkA with subsequent replacement with labeled phosphate through the process termed “back-phosphorylation.” Identification of the serine residues within the TrkA intracellular domain that are substrates of this modulatory activity should allow us to dissect the mechanism by which ceramide and BDNF alter levels of TrkA phosphoserine. Our studies indicate that a p75-activated signaling pathway that involves ceramide acts to negatively regulate ligand-stimulated TrkA activity. Combined with work by others that suggests that a TrkA-derived signal may reduce the capacity of p75NTR to signal (15Dobrowsky R.T. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22135-22142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), this suggests a complex trans-receptor regulatory loop between the two receptors. When exposed to NGF, a preferred ligand, the primary function of p75NTR appears to be to increase TrkA signaling, and the transmodulatory activity of p75NTR is likely inhibited under these conditions. Conversely, in the presence of nonpreferred ligands, our results suggest that p75NTR may inhibit nonpreferred ligand-stimulated TrkA activity through ceramide-dependent receptor transmodulation. We are grateful to Dr. David Kaplan (Montreal Neurological Institute) for providing the anti-Trk sera used in these studies and to Dr. Wayne Sossin, Dr. Christian Lachance, and Christine Zeindler for helpful comments on the manuscript."

FAAH activity has been detected in a wide range of organisms from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Here, we describe cloning of the FAAH gene from Sphingomonas paucimobilis, a sphingolipid- and 2-hydroxymyristic acid-rich bacterium. The isolated gene encoded 415 amino acids. A homology search revealed that amino acid sequences highly conserved in cytochrome P450 (P450) were present in FAAH. Although the heme-binding cysteine was recognizable at position 361, the consensus in the heme-binding region was modified by an insertion. Overall, FAAH has no significant identity to the known P450s. CO difference spectrum of recombinant FAAH showed the characteristic one of P450, except this peak was at 445 nm. These results suggest bacterial FAAH is a novel member of the P450 superfamily.

This reaction pathway results in catalysis of fatty acid to produce the corresponding fatty acid with one less carbon atom, where the fatty acid is first hydroxylated at the 2-position and sequentially decarboxylated to release carbon dioxide. This first and rate-limiting reaction is catalyzed by fatty acid α-hydroxylase (FAAH). 1The abbreviations used are: FAAH, fatty acid α-hydroxylase; P450, cytochrome P450; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ORF, open reading frame; kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. In mammals, the α-oxidation pathway is essential for catabolism of 3-methyl branched fatty acids such as phytanic acid in dietary sources like ruminant fats. Refsum disease is a human inherited disorder resulting from FAAH deficiency, in which phytanic acid exclusively accumulates in the patients' organs such as the liver and in their serum (7Steinberg D. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. 6th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1989: 1533-1550Google Scholar). In the mammalian brain, α-hydroxylation activity of very long chain fatty acids such as lignoceric acid has been reported to be associated with brain development, where 2-hydroxy fatty acid thus produced is introduced into cerebroside utilized for myelin formation (8Murad S.

Using organelles isolated from liver or brain, the α-oxidation pathway has been investigated. However, the enzymatic properties of FAAH described in several reports were inconsistent, e.g. cofactor requirement or substrate specificity (5Tsai S.-C. Avigan J. Steinberg D. J. Biol.

It is noted that a plant FAAH partially purified from cotyledons of germinating peanut seeds requires an H2O2-generating system consisting of glycolate oxidase for its activity (3Castelfranco P. Stumpf P.K. Contopoulou R. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 214: 567-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Stumpf P.K. J. Biol.

We have investigated FAAH isolated from Sphingomonas paucimobilis, a bacterium containing large amounts of sphingoglycolipids (18Matsunaga I. Kusunose E. Yano I. Ichihara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1554-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Most of these sphingoglycolipids contain 2-hydroxymyristic acid (19Yabuuchi E. Yano I. Oyaizu H. Hashimoto Y. Ezaki T. Yamamoto H Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 34: 99-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Our previous studies indicated that FAAH from S. paucimobilis required H2O2for its activity and the oxygen atom of the H2O2 was introduced into myristic acid to produce 2-hydroxymyristic acid (20Matsunaga I. Yamada M. Kusunose E. Nishiuchi Y. Yano I. Ichihara K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We attempted to purify the FAAH. However, complete purification of FAAH was not successful, perhaps because the amount of FAAH of S. paucimobilis was very small and its activity was too labile. Thus, we decided to clone the FAAH gene from this bacterium. Here, we describe cloning and expression of the FAAH gene from S. paucimobilis, and the characterization of the recombinant FAAH. S. paucimobilisEY2395T (19Yabuuchi E. Yano I. Oyaizu H. Hashimoto Y. Ezaki T. Yamamoto H Microbiol.

Escherichia coliJM109 and E. coli BL21 were purchased from Toyobo Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Plasmids pUC18 and pGEM-4T-3 were obtained from Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. (Shiga, Japan) and Pharmacia Biotech Inc., respectively. General cloning techniques were carried out essentially as described by Davis et al. (21Davis L.G. Kuehl W.M. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology.2nd Ed. Appleton & Lange, East Norwalk, CT1994Google Scholar). Genomic DNA from S. paucimobilis EY2395T was partially digested bySau3AI. Three- to 10-kb fragments were ligated intoBamHI-digested pUC18, and these constructs were transfected into E. coli JM109. The transformed cells were cultured in Luria broth (LB) containing ampicillin. At log phase of cell growth, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG, Wako Pure Chemical Co., Osaka, Japan) was added into the culture medium to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cells were cultivated for another 4 h. The cultivated cells were collected by centrifugation and disrupted by sonication in an appropriate volume of 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). After centrifugation to remove disrupted cells, the α-hydroxylation activity in the resultant supernatant was assayed. For rescreening to obtain the DNA fragment encoding the N terminus of the FAAH, genomic DNA from S. paucimobilis was digested by HincII. The digested DNAs were size-selected, and 1.5–2.5-kb DNA fragments were ligated intoHincII-digested pUC18, after which colony hybridization was performed. Labeling of the probe and detection of hybridized fragments were performed with the digoxigenin DNA labeling and detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). Sequencing of DNA fragments was performed using the dye-terminator cycle sequencing kit and an ABI 373A DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA). Alignment analysis was performed as described by Gotoh (22Gotoh O. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 823-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). An EcoRI blunt-ended XbaI fragment containing the FAAH gene was ligated into EcoRI,SmaI-digested pGEM-4T-3. The construct was transfected intoE. coli BL21, and transformed cells were cultured in LB containing ampicillin at 25 °C. At log phase, IPTG was added to the culture medium to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After another 20 h of cultivation, cells were collected by centrifugation and disrupted by sonication in 0.1 mTris-HCl buffer (pH, 7.5), 20% ethylene glycol, 1 mmdithiothreitol (buffer A) containing 1% cholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan). The supernatant obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min was diluted by addition of 2 volumes of buffer A. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST)-FAAH fusion protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia) and then eluted with buffer A containing 0.3% cholic acid, 0.03% SDS, 1.5 m urea, and 5 mm reduced glutathione. The eluate was treated with thrombin at 25 °C for 20 h. The resultant eluate was dialyzed against 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 30% ethylene glycol, 0.4% cholic acid, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (buffer B). The dialyzed eluate was applied to a hydroxylapatite KB HPLC column (Koken Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with buffer B. After the column was washed with an excess amount of buffer B, FAAH was eluted with a 0.1–0.45 m sodium phosphate gradient. CO difference spectrum of the purified FAAH was determined by the method of Omura and Sato (23Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2379-2385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay for fatty acid α-hydroxylation was performed as described previously (20Matsunaga I. Yamada M. Kusunose E. Nishiuchi Y. Yano I. Ichihara K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), except sodium azide was added into the reaction mixture to a final concentration of 3 mm. For identification of the product, the reaction mixture contained 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 0.2 mmH2O2, 60 μm myristic acid, and 0.5 μg of purified FAAH in a total volume of 0.2 ml. Incubation was performed at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of 2 n HCl. The substrate and product were extracted with ethyl acetate and treated with 9-anthryldiazomethane (Funakoshi Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan). The 9-anthryldiazomethane-derivatized fatty acids were analyzed by HPLC as described previously (24Sawamura A. Kusunose E. Satouchi K. Kusunose M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1168: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For cloning of the FAAH gene, a genomic library was constructed using pUC18 and E. coli JM109 transfected with the constructed plasmids was cultivated. After induction by IPTG, the cells were collected, disrupted by sonication, and centrifugated, and then the α-hydroxylation activity in the resultant supernatant was assayed. Four thousand clones were screened, and one positive clone was obtained. The plasmid designated pOC4 isolated from this clone contained a 3.3-kb insert (OC4) (Fig. 1). Sequence analysis of this insert revealed two significant open reading frames (ORFs) at 5′- and 3′-ends. We found that the coding sequence oflacZ of the vector plasmid was connected in frame to 5′-ORF of OC4. Deletion mutants at the 5′-end or 2.8 kb from the 3′-end abolished α-hydroxylation activities. Therefore, we concluded that the 5′-ORF encoded the FAAH. Surprisingly, a homology search for the deduced amino acid sequence of the 5′-ORF revealed homology to sequences conserved in cytochrome P450 (P450); in particular, a highly homologous sequence to the aromatic region of P450 (25Gotoh O. Omura T. Ishimura Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Cytochrome P450. 2nd Ed. Kodansha, Tokyo1993: 255-272Google Scholar) was found in FAAH (Fig. 2). Alignment analysis for FAAH and the known P450s suggested that the N-terminal of FAAH was missing, and thus we screened the library constructed withHincII-digested genomic DNA using a 513-bp fragment from the 5′-end of OC4 (from Sau3AI at 5′-end of OC4 toHincII (SalI)) as a probe (Fig. 1). We obtained a 2.4-kb fragment and found the initiation codon at 54 bp upstream from the 5′-end of OC4. A termination codon was located in frame 51 bp upstream from the initiation codon (Fig. 2 A). The sequence from −29 to −24, AAGGAG, matched to the Shine-Dalgarno consensus sequence, although it was so far from the initiation codon. Consequently, the FAAH gene encoded a protein of 415 amino acids and the calculated molecular weight was 46,485.Figure 2Nucleotide sequence of 1.3-kb fragment containing the FAAH gene and deduced amino acid sequence of FAAH (A) and alignment of the amino acid sequence of helix-K (B), aromatic region (C), and heme-binding region (D).

Particularly, the sequence of the aromatic region of FAAH was highly homologous to that of P450: 75% identical to that of CYP 3A5 (26Aoyama T. Yamano S. Waxman D.J. Lapenson D.P. Meyer U.A. Fischer V. Tyndale R. Inaba T. Kalow W. Gelboin H.V. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10388-10395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 C). With the exception of two cases, Bacillus megaterium CYP 102A and Anabaena sp. ORF3-encoded sequence, bacterial P450s that belong to the B-class generally lack the aromatic region, while all mammalian P450s that belong to the E-class have the aromatic region (25Gotoh O. Omura T. Ishimura Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Cytochrome P450. 2nd Ed. Kodansha, Tokyo1993: 255-272Google Scholar). Therefore, the bacterial FAAH reported here constitutes a third case belonging to the E-class. In helix-K, the EXXR motif, which is completely conserved in the P450 superfamily, was found in FAAH (Fig. 2 B). Although the heme-binding cysteine was found at position 361, the consensus motif of the heme-binding region, FXXGXXXCXG, was modified, where conserved phenylalanine was substituted to glutamine and seven amino acids were found between conserved glycine and cysteine residues (Fig. 2 D). Such insertions were also found in plant P450s, CYP 74A1 (27Song W.-C. Funk C.D. Brash A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8519-8523Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and CYP 74B1 (28Matsui K. Shibutani M. Hase T. Kajiwara T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), in which the phenylalanine was substituted by tryptophan. Interestingly, these P450 enzymes utilized peroxy substrates and did not require molecular oxygen and reducing equivalents for their activities. We observed that the bacterial FAAH efficiently utilized lower amounts of H2O2, and in the presence of H2O2, molecular oxygen and reducing equivalents were not required for α-hydroxylation (20Matsunaga I. Yamada M. Kusunose E. Nishiuchi Y. Yano I. Ichihara K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), suggesting that the structural similarity among FAAH and these peroxide-metabolizing P450s may affect their unusual enzymatic properties. Moreover, in addition to these peroxide-metabolizing P450s, the other P450s, CYP 5A1 (29Ohashi K. Ruan K.-H. Kulmacz R.J. Wu K.K. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 789-793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and CYP 8A1 (30Miyata A. Hara S. Yokoyama C. Inoue H. Ullrich V. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1728-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), which metabolize an endoperoxide, prostaglandin H2, and also do not require molecular oxygen, have substitution of threonine at the appropriate position in helix-I, which is believed to be the critical residue for O2 activation (31Poulos T.L. Raag R. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The sequence of helix-I of FAAH showed no significant homology to those of other P450s and also lacked an adjacent threonine residue. These findings also supported the hypothesis that FAAH utilizes H2O2 but dose not require O2 activation by reductase such as NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (20Matsunaga I. Yamada M. Kusunose E. Nishiuchi Y. Yano I. Ichihara K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Despite the high degree of conservation of sequences found in P450s, overall FAAH had no significant identity to the known P450s (less than 25% identity). However, the hydrophobicity profile (32Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) of FAAH was similar to those of other bacterial P450s, P450cam (CYP 101A) and P450BM3 (CYP 102A) hydroxylase domain, which are soluble enzymes (33Horiuchi T. Koga H. Sagawa Y. Omura T. Ishimura Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Cytochrome P450. 2nd Ed. Kodansha, Tokyo1993: 186-205Google Scholar) (Fig.3), supporting the observation that FAAH was isolated in the soluble fraction (18Matsunaga I. Kusunose E. Yano I. Ichihara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1554-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To examine whether the FAAH gene-encoded protein has the properties of P450, we purified the FAAH overexpressed in E. coli. As shown in Fig. 4 A, theEcoRI-XbaI fragment of pOC4 was inserted into the pGEM-4T-3 expression vector to construct a GST-FAAH fusion gene. In this construct, FAAH was truncated by 18 amino acids at N terminus, but contained all the elements necessary for its activity. The expressed fusion protein was isolated with glutathione-Sepharose and digested with thrombin, and then the FAAH was purified by HPLC with a hydroxylapatite column (Fig. 4 B). The purified FAAH showed myristic acid α-hydroxylation activity in the presence of H2O2 to produce 2-hydroxymyristic acid, while no such activity was detected in the absence of H2O2 (Fig. 4 C). TheK m value for H2O2 was approximately 60 μm, which was similar to that of native FAAH partially purified from S. paucimobilis. Other peroxy compounds, cumene hydroperoxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, andt-butyl peroxybenzonate, were not effective (data not shown). We observed that, like the recombinant FAAH, native FAAH was specific for H2O2. The turnover rate of myristic acid α-hydroxylation by FAAH was very high, comparable to that of P450BM3, which efficiently catalyzes lauric acid (ω-2)-hydroxylation (34Narhi L.O. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7160-7169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); specific activity of FAAH was 838 nmol/min/nmol of protein. We next examined the spectral properties of the FAAH. The CO difference spectrum of FAAH showed the characteristic one of P450, except this peak was at 445 nm (Fig. 4 D). On the basis of the results of sequence and spectral analyses of FAAH, we concluded that bacterial FAAH was a novel member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily. Previously, Muralidharan and Kishimoto (14Muralidharan V.B. Kishimoto Y J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13021-13026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed partial inhibition of phytanic acid α-oxidation of rat liver by CO, indicating a possible involvement of P450. Recently, Pahan et al. (35Pahan K. Khan M. Smith B.T. Singh I. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) reported that CO inhibited phytanic acid α-hydroxylation activity of peroxisomes from human liver. Despite the analysis of CO difference spectrum of the bacterial FAAH revealed that Fe(II)-CO complex was formed (Fig. 4 D), the inhibition of the hydroxylation activity by CO, as can be seen in most of P450s, was not observed (data not shown). Most recently, Borge et al. (36Borge G.I.A. Slinde E. Nilsson A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) reported that palmitic acid can be α-oxidized to release CO2 by only one enzyme purified from cucumber, although its purification was not complete, judging from the observation on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. If fatty acids were first α-hydroxylated, and then decarboxylated in α-oxidation, this enzyme must catalyze these two reactions. FAAH described in this report, however, did not show significant decarboxylase activity. Therefore, at least in bacteria, decarboxylase and FAAH could exist separately. Furthermore, there seems to be a resemblance between the bacterial FAAH and a plant FAAH (16Stumpf P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 223: 643-649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Markovetz A.J. Stumpf P.K. Hammarström S. Lipids. 1972; 7: 159-164Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Both enzymes catalyze α-hydroxylation of straight chain fatty acids and require an H2O2-generating system for their activities. It is particularly interesting that the plant peroxide-metabolizing P450s (27Song W.-C. Funk C.D. Brash A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8519-8523Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 28Matsui K. Shibutani M. Hase T. Kajiwara T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) show the structural similarity to the bacterial FAAH in the heme-binding region, suggesting that P450-like enzymes may involve in fatty acid α-hydroxylation, at least in some species of plants. In any case, further studies are necessary to clarify these points."

To identify novel proteins that interact with IRS proteins in muscle, a human skeletal muscle cDNA expression library was created in the λEXlox system and probed with baculovirus-produced and tyrosine-phosphorylated human IRS-1. One clone of the 10 clones which was positive through three rounds of screening represented the C terminus of the human homologue of the adult fast twitch skeletal muscle Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1) including the cytoplasmic tail and part of transmembrane region 10. Western blot analysis of extracts of rat muscle demonstrated co-immunoprecipitation of both IRS-1 and IRS-2 with the skeletal muscle Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1) and the cardiac muscle isoform (SERCA2). In both cases, injection of insulin stimulated a 2- to 6-fold increase in association of which was maximal within 5 min. In primary cultures of aortic smooth muscle cells and C2C12 cells, the insulin-stimulated interaction between IRS proteins and SERCA1 and -2 was dose-dependent with a maximum induction at 100 nm insulin. This interaction was confirmed in a “pull down” experiment using a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein containing the C terminus of the human SERCA isoform and phosphorylated IRS-1 in vitroand could be blocked by a FLVRES-like domain peptide present in the human SERCA sequence. Affinity chromatography of phosphopeptide libraries using the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of the C terminus of SERCA1 indicated a consensus sequence for binding of XpYGSS; this is identical to potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites at position 431 of human IRS-1 and at position 500 of human IRS-2. In streptozotocin diabetic rats the interaction between IRS proteins and SERCA1 in skeletal muscle and SERCA2 in cardiac muscle was significantly reduced. Taken together, these results indicate that the IRS proteins bind to the Ca2+-ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in an insulin-regulated fashion, thus creating a potential link between the tyrosine phosphorylation cascade and effects of insulin on calcium.

Insulin binding to the insulin receptor leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of several insulin receptor substrates (IRS), 1The abbreviations used are: IRS, insulin receptor substrate(s); PI, phosphatidylinositol; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SH2, Src homology 2; GST, glutathione S-transferase. including IRS-1, IRS-2, IRS-3, Gab1, and Shc (1Cheatham B.

These insulin receptor substrates then bind to a number of proteins in the cell via interaction of tyrosine phosphorylation motifs and specific domains of the target proteins termed SH2 (src homology 2) domains (4White M.F.

For IRS-1 and IRS-2, the SH2 proteins include the lipid-modifying enzyme phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Fyn, the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, and the adaptor molecules Nck and Grb2 (7Baltensperger K.

Exactly how IRS binding to SH2 domain proteins results in signal transduction is still not understood, but for PI 3-kinase and SHP2, binding of phosphorylated IRS-1 results in stimulation of enzymatic activity (13Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. White M.F.

Cell. 1991; 65: 83-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Grb2, on the other hand, has no intrinsic enzymatic activity, but links IRS proteins to the Ras pathway by activating the GTP exchange factor SOS thus stimulating Ras GTPase activity (15Zhang X.F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Activated Ras then initiates a series of signaling events involving Raf, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase which play a role in phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of some of the enzymes involved in insulin action, phosphorylation of several nuclear transcription factors, and some of the effects of insulin in cell growth and gene expression (16Skolnik E.Y. Lee C.H. Batzer A.G. Vicentini L.M. Zhou M. Daly R.J. Myers Jr., M.G. Backer J.M. Ullrich A. White M.F. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1929-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Thus, the IRS proteins serve as an important point in the insulin action pathway at which the signal diverges to produce the multiplicity of final biological effects of the hormone. Most studies of IRS proteins and SH2 domain proteins have been conducted in model cell systems. To identify novel IRS binding proteins in skeletal muscle, the predominant tissue involved in insulin-stimulated glucose disposal and the major site of insulin resistance in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, we screened a human skeletal muscle cDNA expression library with baculovirus-produced human-phosphorylated IRS-1. One of the new IRS-binding proteins identified by the method was the adult fast twitch skeletal muscle Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1). This study reports the result of that screening and demonstrates that the interaction between different isoforms of the Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1 and SERCA2) occurs with both IRS-1 and IRS-2 in intact cells and muscle, is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation after stimulation with insulin, occurs through defined phosphorylation sites in IRS proteins, and may create a link between the tyrosine phosphorylation cascade and ion flux. Polymerase chain reaction was used to introduce a BamHI site at the 5′-untranslated end of human IRS-1 (17Araki E. Sun X.J. Haag III, B.L. Zhang Y. Chuang L.M. Yang-Feng T. White M.F. Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1041-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) which was then subcloned into pBlueBac III (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) in two fragments, using theBamHI and NcoI sites of the vector. The 5′ fragment was from the BamHI site (directly before the initiation ATG at nucleotide 1021) to the SfiI site (nucleotide 1792), and the 3′ fragment was from the SfiI site to the BspHI site (nucleotide 4840). The plasmid was introduced into baculovirus, and a baculovirus stock containing human IRS-1 was made according to manufacturer's protocol. Production of IRS-1 protein and purification over a Sephacryl 300 HR column was carried out as described for rat IRS-1 protein and verified by Western blot analysis using a C-terminal antibody to human IRS-1 (18Sun X.J. Crimmins D.L. Myers Jr., M.G. Miralpeix M. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7418-7428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A human skeletal muscle cDNA expression library was made in the λEXlox system (Novagen, Madison, WI), and isopropylthiogalactopyranoside-induced proteins were bound to nitrocellulose filters (19Coutavas E. Ren M. Oppenheim J.D. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. Nature. 1993; 366: 585-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The IRS-1 protein was phosphorylated by wheat germ agglutinin-purified insulin receptor from Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing human insulin receptor in vitrousing [γ-32P]ATP (20Kahn C.R. White M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1151-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated IRS-1 was separated from free [γ-32P]ATP by using a NAP-10 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Approximately 105 plaques of the human skeletal muscle expression library were screened with the phosphorylated IRS-1 protein. The filters of the expressed proteins were washed in buffer 1 (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and fresh 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol) at room temperature and then placed in blocking buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5% dry milk, and fresh 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 4 to 5 h at 4 °C. This buffer was removed and replaced with blocking buffer containing the labeled IRS-1 protein probe, and the filters were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The filters were then washed in buffer 2 (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, and fresh 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) three times for 15 min each at room temperature, wrapped in plastic wrap, and subjected to autoradiography. Positive plaques were identified, isolated from the plates, and purified by additional screening. A plasmid (pEXlox) containing the insert was obtained by Cre-mediated excision according to Novagen's instructions and sequenced using a polymerase chain reaction-based automatic sequencing with fluorescent dyes and a model 373 automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). C2C12 myoblasts were maintained in the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, 4.5 mg/ml glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 environment. For differentiation of myocytes, confluent cells were fed with DMEM containing 1% calf serum and allowed to differentiate 6–7 days prior to harvesting. Primary smooth muscle cells were obtained from freshly prepared rat aortas and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum in a 10% CO2environment. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (300–350 g) were maintained on standard rodent chow. Twelve to 14 h prior to the experiment, food was withdrawn. The rats were then anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg) injected intraperitoneally. Following loss of pedal and corneal reflexes, 5 units (0.2 mg) of regular insulin or diluent were injected into the portal vein. Quadriceps muscles and cardiac muscle were excised 5 min after injection and homogenized in ice-cold buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 100 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium vanadate, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (5 μg/ml), benzamidine (1.5 mg/ml), and 200 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride using a Polytron PTA 20S generator operated at maximum speed for 30 s (21Araki E.

The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 55,000 rpm in a Ti 70 rotor for 60 min, and equal protein amounts of the supernatant were subjected to immunoprecipitation for 2 h using the indicated antibodies. Subsequently, protein A-Sepharose beads were added for another hour. The beads were washed three times, and proteins were solubilized in 2 × Laemmli sample buffer with boiling and separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels followed by Western immunoblotting using specific antisera and detection with125I-labeled protein A as described previously (22Folli F. Saad M.J.A. Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). SERCA1 and SERCA2 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc. Polyclonal antibody to IRS-2 was provided by Dr. M. F. White (Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA). The Ca2+-ATPase fragment (from nucleotide 894 to 3060) was generated by polymerase chain reaction using the plasmid from the library containing a clone that displayed the C-terminal end of SERCA1 as a template. The resulting cDNA was subcloned intoBamHI-EcoRI, digested pGEX-2TK vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The recombinant plasmid was transformed into BL21 cells (Novagen), and expression of GST-Ca2+-ATPase fragment was induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactone and purified with (GSH)-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) (23Kaelin Jr., Pallas D.C. DeCaprio J.A. Kaye F.J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1993; 64: 521-532Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (433) Google Scholar). For the pull-down experiments, the tissue extracts were obtained as described above and incubated with GST-Ca2+-ATPase fragment or GST-Sepharose beads alone (20 μg) for 1 h at 4 °C followed by washing three times with the lysis buffer. The samples were processed for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the polyclonal C-terminal IRS-1 antibody and the polyclonal phosphotyrosine antibody. IRS-1 was phosphorylated using wheat germ agglutinin-purified insulin receptor in vitro for 3 h at room temperature and then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the GST-Ca2+-ATPase fragment prepared as described above. The beads were washed three times, solubilized with Laemmli buffer, and the proteins resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The blots were probed with the polyclonal IRS-1 antibody. The phosphopeptide library used contains peptides with the general sequence GAXXXpYXXXKKK (single letter amino acid designation), in which pY is phosphotyrosine and X indicates a position of degeneracy containing approximately equimolar amounts of all amino acids except cysteine and tryptophan. The synthesis and analysis of this library were performed as described previously (24Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G.D. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar). 150 μl of glutathione-agarose beads containing approximately 300 μg of the GST-SERCA1 fusion protein or GST protein alone were packed in a 1-ml syringe as an affinity column. The beads were washed with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Approximately 0.45 mg of the degenerate peptide mixture was loaded on the top of the column, and the column was allowed to sit at room temperature for 10 min without flow. The column was then quickly washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS (containing 10 mg of blue dextran per ml and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and was washed once with 1 ml of cold PBS using a plunger to force the solution through. Peptides that remained bound were then eluted from the GST-agarose beads along with the GST-SERCA1 fusion protein using 200 μl of 30% acetic acid over 10 min at room temperature. The eluent was dried down overnight on a Savant Speed-Vac, resuspended in 40 μl of distilled water, and centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 2 min to remove the fusion protein that remains insoluble. The soluble phase, which contains the bound peptides, was then sequenced on an Applied Biosystems model 477A amino acid sequencer (25Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore X.R. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). A human skeletal muscle cDNA expression library was created using the λEXlox system and screened with purified, phosphorylated human IRS-1 protein as described under “Materials and Methods.” Ten plaques producing IRS-1 binding proteins were identified in 100,000 clones, purified through two or three rounds of additional screening, and subjected to Cre-mediated excision (Fig. 1 A). Sequence analysis revealed that one of these clones contained a 351-base pair cDNA with a high degree of homology to the rabbit fast twitch skeletal muscle Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1). When the predicted amino acid sequence of the human muscle clone was compared with the known sequences of rabbit SERCA1 and SERCA2, there was an 88% homology at the amino acid level (Fig. 1 B). In addition, the human clone contained an insert of 42 base pairs that encoded a proline-rich sequence near the C terminus of the molecule not present in the rabbit sequence. SERCAs consist of three globular cytoplasmic domains that are separated by a five-member stalk sector (S1–S5) from the transmembrane sector consisting of 10 helices (M1–M10) (Fig. 1 C). The isolated clone contained the C-terminal end of SERCA1 including the cytoplasmic tail and a part of the transmembrane region 10 (M10). To determine if IRS proteins interact with SERCA1 or SERCA2 in the context of the cellular environment, tissue lysates were prepared from rat muscle before and after insulin injection, immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies to IRS-1 and IRS-2, and blotted with antibodies to SERCA1 and SERCA2. Immunoblotting of the precipitates from skeletal muscle with both anti-IRS-1 and anti-IRS-2 antibodies revealed co-precipitation of species of about 110 kDa representing SERCA1 (Fig.2 A). In both cases there was an insulin-dependent increase in association about 2-fold for IRS-1 and 6-fold for IRS-2. To investigate the potential interaction of IRS-1 and IRS-2 with other SERCA isoforms, we tested extracts of rat cardiac muscle (which contains SERCA2a) before and after insulin stimulation and cultured primary aortic smooth muscle cells (which contains SERCA2b). Again, there was coprecipitation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 with the Ca2+-ATPase from rat cardiac muscle SERCA2 (Fig.2 B) which increased following insulin stimulation. With the smooth muscle cells in culture, insulin also stimulated association of IRS-2 with SERCA2 which was maximal after 5 min of stimulation (Fig.3). The dose dependence of the effect was investigated in cultured C2C12 myotubes that express SERCA1 and primary smooth muscle cell cultures that express SERCA2b and indicated a maximum induction of association at 100 nm insulin (Fig. 3,A and B). The most highly conserved region in SH2 domain proteins is the FLVRES sequence, which has been implicated in phosphotyrosine binding (25Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore X.R. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Although the SERCA proteins do not contain a classic FLVRES sequence, they do contain a similar sequence in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (indicated by the boxed region in Fig. 1 B). Therefore, a 10-amino acid peptide (LKFVARNYLE) was synthesized using the sequence of the region in the Ca2+-ATPase fragment that has the highest similarity with a typical SH2 domain and incubated at concentrations of 0 to 100 μm with lysates from insulin-stimulated rat skeletal muscle during immunoprecipitation with the polyclonal IRS-1 antibody. Western blots of these immunoprecipitates with a monoclonal SERCA1 antibody showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of the binding of IRS-1 to SERCA1 by this peptide, with almost complete inhibition at 1 μm (Fig.4). To explore the possible motif in IRS-1 or IRS-2 involved in binding to SERCA1 the Ca2+-ATPase C-terminal fragment expressed as a GST fusion protein was used to affinity purify a subgroup of phosphopeptides from a synthetic phosphopeptide library as described previously (24Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G.D. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar). The mixture was sequenced, and the relative abundance of the 18 amino acids present at each of the degenerate positions was determined and compared with the abundance in a control experiment. The results are presented in Fig.5. The Ca2+-ATPase C-terminal fragment selectively bound phosphopeptides that have glycine at residue 4 (first residue after Tyr(P)), a serine at residue 5 (second residue after Tyr(P)), and a serine at residue 6 (third residue after Tyr(P)). Thus, a consensus sequence for SERCA binding is pYGSS. This is identical to potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites of human IRS-1 at position 431 (DEYGSSP) and human IRS-2 at position 500 (DEYGSSP). To confirm the IRS-SERCA interaction, the Ca2+-ATPase C-terminal fragment corresponding to the human SERCA isoform identified by library screening was expressed as a GST fusion protein and tested for its ability to bind to and pull down phosphorylated IRS-1 in skeletal muscle lysates from control and insulin-stimulated rats. As shown in Fig.6, the GST-Ca2+-ATPase fragment fusion protein was capable of pulling down IRS-1 in an insulin-dependent manner. The signal was similar to that obtained with pull-down experiments using a GST fusion protein of the N-terminal SH2 domain of the p85α subunit of PI3-kinase. GST alone as a control did not interact with IRS-1. To determine if the SERCA-IRS interaction is direct and does not require other proteins in the complex, and to show that the interaction is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation, we utilized a reconstitution assay with purified IRS-1 that had been phosphorylated using the insulin receptor in vitro. The GST-SERCA fusion protein was then incubated with phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated IRS-1 for 1 h at 4 °C, washed, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting with the IRS-1 antibody. Using equal amounts of IRS-1 protein, as determined by immunoblotting with an anti-insulin, stimulated both autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor and tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (Fig.7 A). Incubation of the non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated IRS-1 with GST alone showed noin vitro association (Fig. 7 B, lanes 1 and2). By contrast, the GST-Ca2+-ATPase fragment associated with IRS-1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (Fig. 7 B, lanes 3 and 4). Thus, there is direct binding of IRS-1 and the Ca2+-ATPase fragment, and this is dependent on IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Previous studies have indicated that the phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 and their ability to bind to and activate SH2 domain proteins is altered in diabetic states. To determine if there is any alteration in the interaction of IRS-1 or IRS-2 with SERCA1 or SERCA2 in diabetes, we performed immunoprecipitations from control and insulin-stimulated skeletal and cardiac muscle of control and streptozotocin diabetic rats. As previously demonstrated, insulin stimulates rapid association between skeletal muscle SERCA1 and IRS-1 and -2 (Fig.8, A and B). Likewise, in the control group, there was a large increase in the association of IRS-2 and SERCA2 after insulin stimulation (Fig.8 C). By comparison, there was no increase in the association of either IRS-1 or IRS-2 and SERCA1 in skeletal muscle or SERCA2 in cardiac muscle after insulin stimulation in streptozotocin diabetic rats. Indeed, in some cases, there was a tendency to a lower than basal association in the tissues of the insulin-treated diabetic rats, although this was not statistically significant. To identify components that might be involved in the skeletal muscle-specific responses to insulin, we created and screened a human skeletal muscle cDNA expression library with baculovirus produced human IRS-1 that had been tyrosine-phosphorylated with the insulin receptor in vitro. Using this approach, we have previously identified two novel isoforms of PI 3-kinase that bind IRS-1, as well as other skeletal muscle-specific proteins, such as titan (26Antonetti D.A. Algenstaedt P. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2195-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have shown that a 351-base pair clone that represents the C terminus of the human adult fast twitch skeletal muscle Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1) is also an IRS-binding protein. This interaction can involve both IRS-1 and IRS-2, as well as both SERCA1 (which is expressed primarily in skeletal muscle) and SERCA2 (which is expressed primarily in cardiac muscle), and can be detected in skeletal and cardiac muscle of the rat and cultured cell lines, such as C2C12 muscle cells and primary rat aortic smooth muscle cells. This interaction is insulin-stimulated in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. To better understand the binding of SERCA1 and SERCA2 with the IRS proteins, we attempted to recreate the interaction in vitro. The pull-down experiments with the Ca2+-ATPase fragment expressed as a GST fusion protein confirm the interaction in an insulin-dependent manner and, in particular, show a direct interaction depending on tyrosine phosphorylation. The Ca2+-ATPase protein consists of a simple polypeptide chain with a molecular mass of 110 kDa. The cloning and sequencing of cDNA encoding the CA2+-ATPase of rabbit muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum have resulted in a proposed structural model for the enzyme in which two cytoplasmic regions are joined to 10 mediated transmembrane α-helices (M1–M10) by a pentahelical stalk region 1–5 (27Maclennan D.H. Brandl C.J. Korczak B. Green N.M. Nature. 1985; 316: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 28Brandl C.J. Green N.M. Korczak B. Maclennan D.H. Cell. 1986; 44: 597-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Each Ca2+-ATPase monomer binds two calcium ions to two high affinity sites on the cytoplasmic face of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. Ca2+ translocation seems to be accomplished through conformational changes in the enzyme whereby the Ca2+ binding sites lose their high affinity and the calcium ions gain access to the terminal membrane surface (29Maclennan D.H. Biophys. J. 1990; 58: 1355-1365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 30Inesi G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 573-601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic calcium acts as a ubiquitous messenger, controlling many different aspects of cellular physiology. In striated muscle, calcium is stored principally within the terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, is released through the calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor) to initiate contraction, and then is taken back up into the sarcoplasmic reticulum via the Ca2+-ATPase pump thus allowing relaxation (31Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14483-14489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum regulates intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. The Ca2+-ATPase utilizes the energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP to transport Ca2+ ions across the membrane against a gradient (29Maclennan D.H. Biophys. J. 1990; 58: 1355-1365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 30Inesi G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 573-601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5736-5742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At least three Ca2+-ATPase isoforms are expressed in tissue-specific and developmentally regulated patterns (33Brandl C.J. deLeon S. Martin D.R. Maclennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3768-3774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lytton J. Zarain-Herzberg A. Periasamy M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7059-7065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fast twitch muscle isoform (SERCA1) is expressed at high levels in striated skeletal muscle. The cardiac/slow-twitch muscle isoform (SERCA2) is expressed at high levels in cardiac cells and, in an alternatively spliced form, in non-muscle cells. SERCA3, the non-muscle isoform, is widely expressed (31Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14483-14489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of a specific subset of SH2 domain-containing proteins to IRS-1 and IRS-2 creates a unique signaling complex with the potential for a diverse range of downstream effects. Binding of phosphorylated IRS-1 or the respective IRS-1-derived phosphotyrosine-containing peptides to SH2 domain containing enzymes such as PI 3-kinase (4White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Grb2 (12Kahn C.R. Schwartz C.J. Born G.V.R. New Horizons in Diabetes Mellitus and Cardiovascular Disease.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1929-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), and SHP2 in vitro results in an increase in their specific activity (4White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of a specific subset of SH2 domain-containing proteins to IRS-1 defines a unique signaling molecule with the potential for a diverse range of downstream effects. SH2 domains are short (approximately 100 amino acids), non-catalytic regions of proteins that facilitate recognition by binding to phosphotyrosine containing proteins (35Koch C.A. Anderson D.J. Moran M.F. Ellis C.A. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments of SH2 domain proteins have demonstrated a relatively highly conserved region corresponding to the FLVRES sequence in src, which is implicated in phosphotyrosine binding (36Shen S.-H. Bastien L. Posner B.I. Chretien P. Nature. 1991; 352: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Although the SERCA1 and -2 do not contain a classical SH2 domain, we identified a conserved region near the C-terminal end of SERCA proteins that has similarity to the FLVRES sequence. Using a 10 amino acid peptide which included this sequence, we were able to compete the binding of IRS-1 to SERCA-1. To identify the potential phosphorylation sites on IRS-1 and IRS-2 which specially bind to the Ca2+-ATPase, we utilized a peptide library screening technique (25Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore X.R. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). This revealed a consensus sequence of pYGSS. This is identical to the motifs in IRS-1 at position 431 and in IRS-2 at position 500 (17Araki E. Sun X.J. Haag III, B.L. Zhang Y. Chuang L.M. Yang-Feng T. White M.F. Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1041-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, a GST-fusion protein containing residues 280 to 511 of IRS-1 bound to SERCA1 in vitro confirming this as the likely site of interaction. Several changes have been demonstrated in cardiac and skeletal muscle in diabetes that reflect possible alterations in the contractile proteins and the membrane systems controlling intracellular Ca2+ kinetics. On one hand, it has been shown that the sarcolemmal Ca2+ transport activity is increased in skeletal muscle of diabetic rats (37Taira Y. Hata T. Ganguly P.K. Elimban V. Dhalla N.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: E626-E632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of the diabetic animals with insulin reverses the changes in the Ca2+transport activity toward the control levels. A similar effect was found in the heart. Thus, the sarcolemmal Ca2+-ATPase activity may be of critical importance in the hypersensitivity of diabetic hearts and cardiomyopathy (38Borda E. Pascual J. Wald M. Sterin-Borda L. Can. J. Cardiol. 1988; 4: 97-101PubMed Google Scholar, 39Makino N. Dhalla K.S. Elimban V. Dhalla N.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: E202-E207PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, there is evidence that Ca2+-ATPase activity is impaired in diabetic animals (40Eibschutz B. Lopaschuk G.D. McNeill J.H. Katz S. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1984; 45: 301-304PubMed Google Scholar). This could result in an increase in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration and play a role in reduced muscle relaxation and development of hypertension (40Eibschutz B. Lopaschuk G.D. McNeill J.H. Katz S. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1984; 45: 301-304PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, expression library screening with IRS-1 protein has revealed novel interactions between IRS-1, IRS-2, and the sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase. This interaction can be demonstrated in skeletal and cardiac muscle in vitro and in vivo, is insulin-regulated, dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation, involves specific domains of IRS-1, IRS-2, and SERCA1, and is altered in diabetes. This interaction creates a potential link between the tyrosine phosphorylation cascade and effects of insulin on calcium and thus may be important in understanding insulin signal transduction in one of the predominant insulin responsive tissues.

In the case of interleukin-6 (IL-6), the signal-transducing complex is composed of the ligand IL-6, the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R, gp80, CD126), and at least two gp130 (CD130) molecules.

The most prominent IL-6 effects are the terminal differentiation of B cells, growth promotion of B and T lymphocytes, and induction of acute phase protein synthesis in hepatocytes (1Heinrich P.C.

Subsequently, this binary complex interacts with two molecules of gp130, resulting in a high affinity receptor complex (6Murakami M. Hibi M. Nakagawa N. Nakawaga T. Yasukawa K. Yamanishi K. Taga T.

The dimerization of the cytoplasmic parts of gp130 initiated by receptor complex formation is believed to be the decisive step for the onset of the signal transduction cascade, which leads to phosphorylation and thereby activation of associated tyrosine kinases of the Jak family (8Lütticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Sendtner M. Heinrich P.C. Horn F.

In the context of their surrounding sequence, these phosphotyrosine side chains serve as docking sites for two transcription factors of the STAT family, STAT1 and STAT3 (10Stahl N. Farruggella T.J.

The bound transcription factors also become tyrosine-phosphorylated by the Jak kinases. Via their SH2-domains, the tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT factors homo- and/or heterodimerize.

In contrast to the intensively studied molecular events of the Jak/STAT signaling pathway emerging from the cytoplasmic part of gp130, the molecular determinants of the extracellular part of gp130 required for the interaction with the IL-6·IL-6R complex are less well characterized.

The second and third ones are designated the cytokine receptor homology domains and are characterized by four conserved cysteine residues and the WSEWS motif, respectively. To map the contact site of gp130 to IL-6 in the IL-6·IL-6R complex in more detail we have introduced single amino acid substitutions in the cytokine binding domain and studied their influence on ternary complex formation. Also, the signaling capabilities of gp130 wild type and point mutants were analyzed. The selection of residues as targets for mutagenesis was guided by a molecular model consisting of IL-6 and the cytokine receptor domains of the IL-6R and gp130 (16Grötzinger J. Kurapkat G. Wollmer A. Kalai M. Rose-John S. Proteins. 1997; 27: 96-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The model was built using the x-ray structure of the related human growth hormone-growth hormone receptor complex as a template (17de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2028) Google Scholar). Whereas growth hormone exhibits two binding sites (sites 1 and 2) for its receptor, extensive mutational analysis of IL-6 led to the identification of three binding sites. The interactions of site 1 with the IL-6R (18Krüttgen A. Rose-John S. Dufhues G. Bender S. Lütticken C. Freyer P. Heinrich P.C.

The crucial residues involved in the interaction of IL-6 with the IL-6R proposed from this model were confirmed by mutagenesis studies of both molecules (16Grötzinger J. Kurapkat G. Wollmer A.

The defined contact sites of IL-6R in the IL-6/IL-6R interface are located in the predicted loop regions of the third fibronectin type III-like domain. We assumed that the interaction of gp130 with IL-6 is mediated by residues in analogous positions as in the respective cytokine receptor homology domain of the human growth hormone receptor. This approach led to the identification of four amino acid residues of gp130 that, when exchanged, resulted in a reduced ternary complex formation and a decreased signaling capability. These data suggest that our model of the IL-6·IL-6R·gp130 complex provides a promising basis for the guidance of further studies on the structure/function relationships of the gp130 cytokine receptor domains. Restriction enzymes and T4-DNA ligase were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). Tran35S-label was purchased from ICN (Meckenheim, Germany). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and RPMI 1640 were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Eggenstein, Germany), and fetal calf serum was purchased from Seromed (Berlin, Germany). The eukaryotic expression vector pSVLgp130 was a kind gift of Drs. T. Taga and T. Kishimoto (Osaka University Medical School, Osaka, Japan). Recombinant IL-6 was prepared as described by Arcone et al. (26Arcone R. Pucci P. Zappacosta F. Fontaine V. Malorni A. Marino G. Ciliberto G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The specific activity was 2 × 106 B cell stimulatory factor-2 units/mg of protein. Soluble human IL-6R (shIL-6R) was prepared in insect cells as described previously (27Weiergräber O. Hemmann U. Küster A. Müller-Newen G. Schneider J. Rose-John S. Kurschat P. Brakenhoff J.P.J.

The polyclonal rabbit-anti-human IL-6R antiserum was raised against a part of the IL-6R extracellular domain (28Stoyan T. Michaelis U. Schooltink H. Van Dam M. Rudolph R. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S.

Simian monkey kidney cells (COS-7) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, and 60 mg/liter penicillin. Ba/F3 cells, a murine pro-B lymphocyte line, were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum and 5% conditioned medium from X63Ag-653 BPV-mIL-3 myeloma cells as a source of IL-3. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere at 5% CO2. Standard cloning procedures were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used for construction of the point mutants: Y218K, 5′-TCCTGTAAAAAAAGTGAA-3′ sense and 5′-TTCACTTTTTTTACAGGA-3′ antisense; V252D, 5′-ATTAAGAGTGATATAATA-3′ sense and 5′-AGTATTATATCACTCTTAAT-3′ antisense; G306W, 5′-GGAAGATTGGAAGGGATA-3′ sense and 5′-TATCCCTTCCAATCTTCC-3′ antisense; K307E, 5′-AAGATGGTCAGGGATACT-3′ sense and 5′-AGTATCCCTGACCATCTT-3′ antisense. The mutated nucleotides are underlined. The polymerase chain reactions were carried out under the following conditions: first denaturation, 120 s at 94 °C; annealing, 120 s at 44 °C; primer extension, 120 s at 72 °C; denaturation, 60 s at 94 °C (35 cycles); last primer extension, 300 s at 72 °C. The resulting polymerase chain reaction products were digested with the restriction enzymesXhoI and BstEI and cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pSVLgp130. The integrity of the constructs pSVLgp130Y218K, pSVLgp130V252D, pSVLgp130G306W, and pSVLgp130K307E was verified by DNA sequencing. A Bluescript-SK-gp130-Flag vector encoding gp130 tagged with a Flag epitope (5′-CAT GTC GAC TAC AAA GAC GAT GAC GAT AAA TAG-3′) at its C terminus was digested with the restriction endonucleasesEcoRI and SphI to delete the intracellular and transmembrane regions of gp130. The EcoRI 5′-overhang was filled in by Klenow reaction, and the SphI overhang was digested with nuclease S1. After blunt end religation of the plasmid, the reconstituted EcoRI site was destroyed. The shgp130-Flag cDNA was subcloned into the expression vector pSVL via the restriction sites XhoI and BamHI. The cDNAs of the gp130 point mutants were subcloned into the vector pSVLshgp130-Flag via XhoI and SpeI. To construct the proteins gp130-Yγ440, gp130Y218K-Yγ440, gp130V252D-Yγ440, gp130G306W-Yγ440, and gp130K307E-Yγ440, the cDNAs encoding the wild type and mutant gp130 extracellular domains were subcloned into the vector pSVLEg-Yγ440 via the XhoI and EcoRI restriction sites. The vector pSVLEg-Yγ440 encodes the extracellular domain of the murine erythropoietin receptor and the transmembrane and intracellular parts of gp130 (amino acids 598–732) fused with a YDKPH motif (Yγ440) of the interferon γ receptor (11Gerhartz C.

The electroporation was performed at 1.500 V for 99 μs. Metabolic labeling was performed 48 h after transfection. The cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]cysteine/methionine for 4 h and subsequently chased with rich medium for 1 h. Plasmid DNA was transfected into Ba/F3 cells by electroporation. 28 μg of pSVL containing the cDNAs for wild type gp130 or the mutants Y218K and V252D were co-electroporated with 2 μg of pSV2neo into 3.5 × 106 cells in 0.8 ml of medium at 200 V and 70 ms. Selection with G418 (1 mg/ml) in interleukin-3-conditioned medium was initiated 24 h after transfection. Selected Ba/F3 clones were screened for the presence of membrane-bound gp130 proteins by binding of the anti-gp130-antibodies B-S12 and B-T12 as analyzed by flow cytometry. Ba/F3 or COS-7 cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in cold PBS supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 0.1% sodium azide (PBS/azide). 5 × 105 to 1 × 106 cells in 100 μl of PBS/azide were incubated with 4 μg/ml of either the monoclonal anti-gp130-antibodies B-T12 or B-S12 or with a control murine IgG for 30 min on ice. Cells were then washed twice with cold PBS/azide. To visualize the antibodies bound to the gp130 proteins, the cells were subsequently incubated in darkness with a 1:50 dilution of a R-phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG-Fab (Dianova, Hamburg) for 30 min on ice. Cells were again washed twice with cold PBS/azide and then resuspended in PBS/azide with 1% formaldehyde. 104 cells/sample were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACStar Plus (Beckton Dickinson) equipped with a 488-nm argon laser. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the eukaryotic expression vector pCDM8-huIL-6R and metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine/methionine. Subsequently, the soluble form of the 35S-labeled IL-6R ([35S]shIL-6R) was generated by induction of a yet unidentified shedding protease with 0.1 μm phorbol myristate acetate. The [35S]shIL-6R was released into the supernatant of the cells. Supernatants of COS-7 cells transiently transfected with shgp130-Flag, shgp130Y218K-Flag, shgp130V252D-Flag, shgp130G306W-Flag, or shgp130K307E-Flag fusion protein expression vectors and metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine/methionine were collected. Subsequently, the soluble proteins were precipitated with 0.5 μg/ml of the monoclonal anti-Flag-antibody M2 (Kodak, Germany) at 4 °C for 16 h and immobilized using 1.25 mg/ml protein A-Sepharose. The Sepharose-bound [35S]shgp130-Flag fusion proteins were then incubated with 250 μl of COS-7 cell supernatant containing [35S]shIL-6R and 400 ng of IL-6 in a total volume of 1 ml. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the IL-6/[35S]shIL-6R/[35S]shgp130-Flag complexes were sedimented by centrifugation via protein A-Sepharose. Expression of the [35S]shgp130-Flag proteins and ternary complex formation were visualized by detection of 100-kDa (shgp130-Flag) and 66-kDa (shIL-6R) proteins after SDS-polyacrylamide gel (7.5%) electrophoresis and fluorography. The expression levels of the shgp130-Flag fusion proteins and the level of shIL-6R co-precipitated in the ternary complex were quantified by use of a PhosphorImager (STORM 840, Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). COS-7 cells were transfected with wild type gp130-Yγ440, gp130Y218K-Yγ440, gp130V252D-Yγ440, gp130G306W-Yγ440, or gp130K307E-Yγ440 expression plasmids. 48 h after transfection, the cells were stimulated with 4 ng/ml IL-6 and 1 μg/ml shIL-6R for 15 min. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described (14Wegenka U.M. Lütticken C. Buschmann J. Yuan J. Lottspeich F. Müller-Esterl W. Schindler C. Roeb E. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3186-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). For the preparation of nuclear extracts from COS-7 cells, a band shift incubation buffer without KCl was used. A mutated double-stranded SIE oligonucleotide from the c-fos promoter (m67SIE; 5′-GATCCGGGAGGGATTTACGGGGAAATGCTG-3′) was used as32P-labeled probe (30Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The protein-DNA complexes were separated on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 7.5% glycerol. The electrophoresis was run in 0.25-fold TBE buffer at 200 V/cm for 4 h. Approximately 1 × 105 transfected COS-7 cells were seeded on glass coverslips. 48 h after transfection, the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min as described (31Graeve L. Drickamer K. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell. Biol. 1989; 265: 1216-1224Google Scholar), and unspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with 50 ng/ml of the monoclonal gp130-antibodies B-T12 or B-S12 for 20 min. Antibodies bound to the cell surface were detected using a 1:200 dilution of a rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Dianova, Hamburg) for 20 min in darkness. The coverslips were then mounted on slides with Mowiol™ 4–88 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp.) and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. The cells were photographed at a × 500 magnification. 5 × 106 Ba/F3, BAF-gp130, BAF-Y218K, or BAF-V252D cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of [125I]IL-6 (specific activity, 2,500 cpm/fmol) and 3.3 μg/ml shIL-6R in 100 μl of medium for 16 h at 4 °C. After sedimentation of the cells through dibutyl/dinonyl phthalate oil (1.020 g/ml), cell-associated and free radioactivity were measured in a γ-counter. Specific binding was obtained by subtracting the radioactivity associated with the untransfected Ba/F3 cells (nonspecific binding) from that bound to the Ba/F3 transfectants (total binding). 2 × 104 Ba/F3 cells stably transfected with gp130, gp130Y218K, or gp130V252D were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing the indicated concentrations of IL-6 and shIL-6R or of the antibodies B-S12 and B-P8. B-S12 is an agonistic gp130-antibody, while B-P8 acts synergistically (32Wijdenes J. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. Roche C. Zong-Jiang G. Clement C. Klein B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3474-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). After 60 h of incubation, viable and metabolically active cells were quantified by using the colorimetric Cell Proliferation Kit II (XTT) (Boehringer Mannheim). Based on the x-ray structure of the human growth hormone-human growth hormone receptor complex, a model of the IL-6·IL-6R·gp130 complex was built and used successfully for the rational design of site-directed mutagenesis experiments with IL-6 and the IL-6R (24Kalai M. Montero-Julian F.A. Grötzinger J. Fontaine V. Vandenbussche P. Deschuyteneer R. Wollmer A. Brailly H. Content J. Blood. 1997; 89: 1319-1333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have taken this model to guide mutagenesis experiments also with gp130 and focused on residues predicted to be in contact with site 2 of IL-6. Like in the human growth hormone-growth hormone receptor complex this area is characterized by several hydrophobic interactions covered by a hydrophilic, charged layer. Besides others, the residues involved and therefore mutated in this study are tyrosine 218 (Y218), glycine 306 (G306), lysine 307 (K307), and valine 252 (V252) (Fig. 1). The mutations were chosen for the following reasons: 1) Y218K and V252D are expected to destroy the central hydrophobic interaction between gp130 and IL-6, 2) G306W should introduce sterical constraints in the contact region, and 3) K307E should destabilize the hydrophobic core of the interaction by making it more accessible for water molecules. All of these mutations were expected to impair the interaction between gp130 and the ligand-receptor complex. The point mutations described above were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. In addition, the transmembrane and cytoplasmic parts of gp130 were replaced by a Flag epitope to allow immunoprecipitation with a specific monoclonal anti-Flag-antibody. Formation of ternary complexes was analyzed by co-precipitation of [35S]shIL-6R in the presence of IL-6. The mutant proteins were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. After metabolic labeling with [35S]cysteine/methionine, the soluble proteins were immunoprecipitated from supernatants with the anti-Flag antibody M2 and immobilized using protein A-Sepharose. The Sepharose-bound [35S]shgp130-Flag proteins were subsequently incubated with IL-6 and the shed form of metabolically labeled IL-6R ([35S]shIL-6R). The ternary complexes were precipitated and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both the [35S]shgp130 proteins and the [35S]shIL-6R were visualized by fluorography (Fig.2 A). In the presence of IL-6, the shIL-6R was immunoprecipitated with a monospecific anti-IL-6R-antiserum (lane 1). As expected, shIL-6R appeared as a protein of about 66 kDa. The shIL-6R was not precipitated in the absence of a specific antiserum, regardless whether IL-6 was present (lane 2) or not (lane 3), indicating that the shIL-6R does not bind unspecifically to protein A-Sepharose. When shIL-6R was incubated with wild type shgp130-Flag and IL-6 (lane 5), it was co-precipitated, indicating that the ternary complex had been formed. No co-precipitation was observed in the absence of IL-6 (lane 4). The results obtained with the gp130 point mutants are shown in lanes 6–9. The IL-6R band corresponding to the mutant Y218K-Flag (lane 6) exhibited a similar intensity as the wild type gp130, whereas only faint bands were visualized for the mutants V252D (lane 7), G306W (lane 8), and K307E (lane 9). The 100-kDa shgp130-Flag wild type and mutant proteins available for complex formation can be seen in addition to the shIL-6R protein inlanes 4–9. Using a PhosphorImager, we quantified the relative amounts of [35S]shgp130-Flag fusion proteins and [35S]shIL-6R as shown in Fig. 2 B. This enabled us to compare the amounts of shgp130-Flag proteins with their capabilities to form complexes with IL-6 and the shIL-6R. A comparison of the binding data of wild type and mutant gp130-Flag proteins calculated from four independent experiments is shown in TableI. The mutant V252D-Flag showed 45.3 ± 4.0% binding relative to wild type gp130, which was defined as 100%. Y218K-Flag and K307E-Flag exhibited 76.7 ± 5.1% and 73.7 ± 17.7% binding, respectively. The mutant G306W showed 63.6 ± 12.7% binding.Table IBinding of mutant shgp130-Flag fusion proteinsProteinBinding%shgpg130-Flag100shgp130 Y218K-Flag76.7 ± 5.1shgp130 V252D-Flag45.3 ± 4.0shgp130 G306W-Flag63.6 ± 12.7shgp130 K307E-Flag73.7 ± 17.7Ternary complex formation assays were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 2, and the relative intensities of the detected bands were measured using a PhosphorImager (Fig. 2 B).

The averaged values (±S.D.) of four independent experiments are given.

The averaged values (±S.D.) of four independent experiments are given. To ensure that the reduced binding of the gp130 mutants was not due to misfolded proteins, we performed immunofluorescence staining experiments. COS-7 cells transfected with membrane-bound wild type and mutant gp130 proteins were incubated with the monoclonal human gp130 antibody B-T12 or B-S12. The B-T12 antibody recognizes an epitope within the gp130 fibronectin type III domains 4–6, and the B-S12 antibody binds to the third domain of gp130, comprising the mutated residues (32Wijdenes J. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. Roche C. Zong-Jiang G. Clement C. Klein B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3474-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Both antibodies do not recognize linear peptide sequences of gp130 and are therefore suitable for the detection of properly folded proteins. The bright staining of the cells shows that the B-T12 and the B-S12 antibodies were able to bind to all of the gp130 point mutants (Fig. 3). Thus, the reduced binding of the gp130 mutants to the IL-6·IL-6R complex does not seem to be due to changes either in their overall structure or in the fold of the third domain. Since ternary complex formation is essential for signal transduction, we supposed that changes in binding of the gp130 point mutants to IL-6·IL-6R complexes should also lead to alterations in signaling. In human hepatoma cells (HepG2), the transcription factors STAT1 and STAT3 are efficiently activated by tyrosine phosphorylation after IL-6 stimulation (8Lütticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J.

The protein kinases constitute a diverse family of enzymes with well over one thousand members discovered to date. They differ in substrate specificity (serine/threonine- versustyrosine-specific) as well as in their role in specific signal transduction pathways. Despite this considerable diversity, genetic and structural analyses of the catalytic portions of these enzymes have shown that they evolved from a common ancestor and share a conserved overall fold (1Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 2Meinkoth J.L. Alberts A.S. Went W. Fantozzi D. Taylor S.S. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.

This catalytic core is often flanked by well defined structural domains that confer functional properties upon the enzyme. For example, SH2, SH3, pleckstrin, C1, C2, and Lim domains have been implicated in mediating specific protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions that control specificity and/or alter activity in particular protein kinases (4Gill G.N.

With this added structural complexity, in many cases it is still unclear how signals from outside the cell reach a specific target in the dense reaches of the cytoplasm and nucleus in a timely fashion. An attractive proposal has recently been raised to address this particular problem. The “targeting hypothesis” proposes that phosphorylation events are controlled, in part, by subcellular localization of protein kinases and phosphatases in the cell via the interaction of targeting domains on the enzymes with specific anchoring proteins (7Scott J.D.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12881-12884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The principle behind localization is that the protein kinase will be held in close proximity to its target and released when the activation signal is discharged. A pressing issue, then, is to define the molecular basis for these targeting interactions. The correct intracellular targeting of protein kinases and phosphatases confers specificity to the enzymes, in part, by placing them in close proximity to their preferred substrates. Targeting of these enzymes occurs via association with specific proteins that are found in different locations in the cell (7Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol.

The classic example of localization of kinase function is the scaffolding of the enzymes involved in the yeast mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade. The pathway is tightly controlled as a result of the interaction of each enzyme in the cascade with a common scaffolding protein, Ste5 (13Levin D.E. Errede B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Mammalian proteins that serve a similar function are the family of A-KinaseAnchoring Proteins (AKAPs) 1The abbreviations used are: AKAP, protein kinase A anchoring protein; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; R2 subunit, cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit dimer; C subunit, cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; NOE nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; CSI, chemical shift index; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; HMQC, heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence. identified by Scott and co-workers (14Coghlan V.M.

Curr. Biol. 1996; 7: 52-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (223) Google Scholar). AKAPs maintain the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in specific subcellular compartments, thereby ensuring accessibility of the kinase to a limited number of substrates in a particular location (7Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 8Faux M.C. Scott J.D.

Sci. 1996; 21: 312-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This compartmentalization occurs through the interaction of the regulatory domain of PKA with a conserved “anchoring site” on the various AKAPs. The AKAPs also contain a unique “targeting domain” that interacts directly with specific structural proteins, organelles, or membranes. The current PKA anchoring hypothesis is best described by the model depicted in Fig. 1. The enzyme is an inactive tetramer composed of a regulatory dimer (R2) and two catalytic (2C) subunits (R2C2) that make up the inactive PKA holoenzyme complex. Binding of the second messenger cAMP to the regulatory subunit dissociates the tetramer to produce the intact R2 dimer and release two catalytically active monomeric C subunits. Localization of PKA occurs through interaction of the AKAP with the N-terminal dimerization domain of the regulatory subunit. The site of RII binding to the AKAPs has been identified for several anchoring proteins, and computer-aided secondary structure prediction has revealed sequences of about 14 residues in Ht31, Ht21, P150, and mitogen-activated protein-2 that have a high probability for amphipathic helix formation (16Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S. Brennan R.G. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that are most likely the RII binding region. A 22-residue peptide mimicking the RII binding site of Ht31 has been synthesized which inhibits the binding of full-length Ht31 binding to RII (17Carr D.W. Hausken Z.E. Fraser I.D.C. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13376-13382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although x-ray crystallographic analysis has been successful in elucidating the structure of a fragment that encompasses the cAMP binding domains of the regulatory subunit (18Su Y. Dostmann R.G.

Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), until this time there was no structural information on the dimerization and AKAP binding regions. We bacterially expressed, isotopically enriched, and purified the 44-residue dimerization domain of the type IIαR2 subunit (RIIα-(1–44)). This region is highly stable and binds anchoring proteins and peptides with nanomolar affinity (19Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V.M. Hastings C.A.S. Reimann E.M. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24245-24251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Luo Z. Shafit-Zagardo B. Erlichman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21804-21810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this article, we report the 1H,15N, and 13C backbone resonance assignments and secondary structure analysis of uniformly 15N and13C isotopically enriched RIIα-(1–44) as determined by multidimensional heteronuclear NMR techniques. The plasmid encoding the gene for recombinant RIIα-(1–44) was inserted into the pET16b (Novagen, Inc.) expression vector. This construct allows for the rapid purification of the expressed protein by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The intact RIIα domain is released from the N-terminal His-tag by factor Xa cleavage (21Aurell L. Friberger P. Karlsson G. Clauson G. Thromb. Res. 1977; 11: 595-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22Nagai K. Th⊘gersen H.C. Nature. 1984; 309: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coliBL21 (DE3) cells. 1 liter of media (either Luria-Bertani broth (LB) for obtaining unlabeled RIIα-(1–44) or minimal media supplemented with 2.5 g/liter [13C]glucose and/or 2.0 g/liter [15N]ammonium sulfate (Isotech, Inc.) for obtaining 15N/13C-enriched RIIα-(1–44)) containing 150 mg/ml ampicillin is inoculated with a 5-ml starting culture of E. coli. The 1-liter culture is grown at 37 °C to an A 600of 0.5 prior to induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. Cells are harvested by centrifugation for 45 min at 7,000 × g. The cells are resuspended in 40 ml of buffer A (5 mmimidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 4 °C) and lysed by sonication. The cellular debris is collected by centrifugation at 30,000 × g. RIIα-(1–44) grown in LB media is expressed as inclusion bodies, which are solubilized and unfolded using 5 ml of 6m guanidine HCl for 1 h at 25 °C. The protein is refolded by slow dilution with 25 ml of buffer A containing 1m imidazole over 2 h, followed by subsequent dialysis into buffer A at 4 °C. RIIα-(1–44) grown in minimal media is found in the soluble fraction. The dialysate or supernatant was applied to a nickel chelating column (Novagen, Inc.) equilibrated in buffer A. The column is washed with 3 column volumes of buffer A and 10 column volumes of buffer A containing 60 mm imidazole to remove any nonspecifically bound protein. The RIIα His-tag fusion protein is eluted in 20 ml of buffer A with 1 m imidazole and concentrated to 10 ml by Centriplus (Amicon, Inc.). The protein is then exchanged into buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, pH 8.0) using a PD-10 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Release of RIIα from the fusion protein is accomplished by incubating 25 mg of factor Xa (New England Biolabs, Inc.) for every 8 mg of RIIα-(1–44). The reaction mixture is incubated overnight at 37 °C with shaking. The efficiency of the cleavage reaction is ∼90%, as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A Superdex 75 HiLoad 16/60 (Pharmacia) 120-ml gel filtration column equilibrated in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 4.0, separated the factor Xa and the cleaved His-Tag from the RIIα protein. Purified RIIα-(1–44) eluted at 70 ml and was concentrated by Centriplus (Amicon, Inc.). The purified RIIα-(1–44) contains two additional N-terminal amino acids (designated His−1-Met0) as a result of the vector construction (Novagen, Inc.). The protein concentration was determined at a wavelength of 278 nm using an extinction coefficient of 2800 m−1cm−1 obtained from the method of Gill and von Hippel (23Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). RIIα-(1–44) was >95% pure as determined from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Complete cleavage of the fusion protein was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analysis. All NMR experiments were performed at 25 °C on either a Bruker DMX500 or a DRX600 spectrometer using a triple resonance gradient probe. Optimal NMR conditions were determined from a two-dimensional homonuclear TOCSY (24Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) pH titration performed on a 2 mm (dimer concentration) unlabeled sample of RIIα-(1–44) in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 90% H2O, 10% D2O. The 1H spectral widths were 5000 Hz (10 ppm) in both t 2and t 1. 2K by 512 point matrices were collected. Water suppression was achieved through a WATERGATE sequence (25Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V.

An MLEV-17 (24Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) sequence of 59.3 ms was used for the TOCSY spin lock. The optimal pH was determined as pH 4 to be used in further NMR experiments. Typically, the isotopically enriched NMR samples were prepared at a dimer concentration of 1 mm (2 mm monomer) in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 90% H2O, 10% D2O, pH 4.0. The 1H chemical shift of water was 4.755 ppm when referenced to sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate, whereas 15N and13C were indirectly referenced to sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate, as established by Wishartet al. (27Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). Quadrature phase detection in the indirectly detected dimensions for all experiments was obtained via time proportional phase incrementation (28Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 608-613Crossref Scopus (3524) Google Scholar), except for the CBCA(CO)NH and HNCACB experiments, which utilized States (29States D.J. Haberkorn R.A., J. R. D. J. Magn.

Using the same unlabeled protein sample as described for the two-dimensional TOCSY experiments, a two-dimensional homonuclear NOESY (33Jeener T. Meier B.H. Bachman P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4845) Google Scholar) experiment was collected with a mixing time of 200 ms. The1H spectral widths were 5000 Hz (10 ppm) in botht 2 and t 1. A 4K by 512 point matrix was collected. Water suppression was achieved through the WATERGATE sequence (25Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol.

In the HSQC and the NOESY-HSQC experiments, the 1H carrier during the evolution of the 15N and 1H dimensions was centered at the water frequency but was shifted to 8.045 ppm before acquisition. In the TOCSY-HMQC experiment, the1H carrier was placed on the water frequency throughout the entire experiment. In all three experiments the 15N carrier was placed at 117.5 ppm. Mixing times of 150 and 200 ms were used for the NOESY-HSQC, while the TOCSY-HMQC experiments were run at spin-lock times of 40.5, 81.0, and 101.3 ms. Water suppression for the HSQC and NOESY-HSQC was accomplished using the gradient tailored WATERGATE sequence (25Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar, 26241–245Sklenar, V., Piotto, M., Leppik, R., and Saudek, V. (1993) J. Magn. Reson. , 241–245.Google Scholar). A presaturation pulse was employed to suppress the water in the TOCSY-HMQC. Broadband 15N decoupling for the three 1H-15N experiments was accomplished using a WALTZ16 decoupling scheme (37Shaka A.J. Keeler L. Frenkiel T. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 52: 335-338Google Scholar). In the two-dimensional HSQC experiment, 128 real t 1 (15N) and 512 complex t 2 (1H) points were collected with spectral widths corresponding to 1773 Hz (35 ppm) (t 1) and 3005 Hz (6 ppm) (t 2). For the three-dimensional1H-15N experiments, a total of 128 realt 1 (1H), 64 realt 2 (15N), and 512 complext 3 (1H) points were collected. The spectral widths were 4999 Hz (10 ppm) (t 1), 1773 Hz (35 ppm) (t 2), and either 5000 (10 ppm) or 3005 Hz (6 ppm) (t 3). The three-dimensional CBCA(CO)NH (30Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. J. Magn.

The 1H carrier was either placed at the water frequency throughout the entire experiment (HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH), shifted to 8.045 ppm (HNCA, HN(CO)CA), or shifted to 2.407 ppm (HCCH-TOCSY) prior to data acquisition. The 15N carrier was placed at 117 ppm for all triple resonance experiments, and the13C carrier was set to either 42.3 (HNCACB and HCCH-TOCSY) or 57.3 ppm (HNCA and HN(CO)CA). For the CBCA(CO)NH experiment, the13C carrier originated at 42.3 ppm but once the magnetization was transferred to 13C′, the carrier was shifted to 177.3 ppm. The WATERGATE sequence (25Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar, 26241–245Sklenar, V., Piotto, M., Leppik, R., and Saudek, V. (1993) J. Magn.

The total number of points collected for the CBCA(CO)NH and HNCACB experiments was 38 or 52 complext 1 (15N), 52 complext 2 (13C), and 1024 complext 3 (1H), and the spectral widths were 1520 Hz (25 ppm)(t 1), 10564 Hz (70 ppm)(t 2), and 7184 Hz (12 ppm) (t 3). In the HNCA and HN(CO)CA experiments, 64 real t 1 (13C), 48 or 50 realt 2 (15N), and 512 complext 3 (1H) points were collected at spectral widths of 3771 Hz (t 1), 1266 (25 ppm) or 1367 Hz (27 ppm) (t 2), and 3005 Hz (6 ppm) (t 3). The HCCH-TOCSY experiment was acquired with 128 real t 1 (1H), 110 realt 2 (13C), and 512 complext 3 (1H) points and 4999 Hz (10 ppm) (t 1), 8400 Hz (67 ppm) (t 2), and 3005 Hz (6 ppm) (t 3) spectral widths. Amide proton exchange experiments were carried out on a 0.5 mm protein sample originally in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 90% H2O, 10% D2O, pH 4.0, which was exchanged into 20 mm deuterated sodium phosphate buffer, 100% D2O pD 3.5, using Quick SpinTMProtein Columns (Boehringer Mannheim). Two-dimensional HSQC experiments, matrix size 512 × 64, were run at times of 10 and 30 min, 2, 7, and 25 h after exchange into D2O. All experiments were processed using Felix 95.0 software (MSI, San Diego, CA) using an Indigo-2 workstation (Silicon Graphics, Inc.). The data were apodized with a squared sinebell function shifted by 70° in all dimensions before Fourier transformation. For all three-dimensional experiments linear prediction to an additional one-third of the number of points collected was applied before apodization in botht 1 and t 2. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were measured at pH values 4.0 and 7.0 in 20 mmsodium phosphate buffer at 25 °C. CD spectra were obtained on an Aviv 61DS spectropolarimeter (Aviv Associates) calibrated with a standard solution of 10- camphorsulfonic acid (47Johnson Jr., W.C. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1985; 31: 61-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Johnson Jr., W.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Spectra were measured with a 0.5-nm bandwidth, 0.5-nm step size, and a 1.0-s time constant over a wavelength range of 260 to 180 nm in 0.1-cm optical cells. Gel filtration chromatography was performed on a TSKGel G2000SW column (Tosohaas, Inc.), 30 cm by 7.8 mm. 50 μl of a 0.8 mg/ml RIIα-(1–44) sample was injected onto the column equilibrated in 20 mm phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 4.0, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was calibrated with standard proteins corresponding to molecular masses of 670, 158, 44, 17, and 1.35 kDa (Bio-Rad, Inc.). At pH 7.2, the two-dimensional1H-15N HSQC experiment of RIIα-(1–44) displays a well dispersed spectrum (data not shown). Fig. 2 A shows that at this same pH, the efficiency of the TOCSY transfer in the two-dimensional homonuclear TOCSY is extremely poor. The data in the TOCSY experiment were greatly improved as the pH was varied from pH 7 to pH 4, as seen in Fig. 2 B. It is evident from these NMR spectra that as the pH of the sample decreases, the protein becomes more amenable to study by NMR methods. One concern with doing NMR studies at pH 4 is that significant structural changes may accompany the change in solution conditions. To address this issue, we examined two parameters. First we found that the aliphatic proton resonances do not shift upon variation of pH (data not shown). Second, circular dichroism (CD) analysis was performed. A comparison plot of the mean residue ellipticity of the protein at pH values 4.0 and 7.0 as a function of wavelength is given in Fig.3. The spectra show the classic double minima at 210 and 222 nm expected for helical structure in solution (49Venyaminov S.Y. Yang J.T. Determination of Protein Secondary Structure. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules.in: Fasman G.D. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996Google Scholar). In addition, the spectra of the domain were identical at pH 4.0 and 7.0 (Fig. 3), indicating no gross structural changes occur as a result of the change in solution conditions. Our CD results indicate the presence of significant helical structure (∼50%) (49Venyaminov S.Y. Yang J.T. Determination of Protein Secondary Structure. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules.in: Fasman G.D. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996Google Scholar), consistent with our interpretation of the NMR data (see “Discussion”). Dynamic light scattering results indicate a decrease in the apparent molecular weight upon decreasing pH, suggesting a reduction in non-native protein association into higher order oligomers. The minimum apparent molecular weight observed by this technique is in the pH range of 3 to 4. Gel filtration chromatography demonstrates the presence of a single species at pH 4.0 with the apparent molecular weight expected for dimeric RIIα-(1–44) (data not shown). TOCSY observations also indicate a reduction in the amount of nonspecific protein association upon decreasing pH. Aliphatic proton linewidths at pH 4.0 are consistent with a dimeric system (results not shown). Based on the increase in magnetization transfer, the observation of a single species by gel filtration chromatography, a molecular weight consistent dimeric RIIα-(1–44), and line widths typical of an 11-kDa protein, a pH of 4.0 was chosen as optimal for further NMR spectroscopic structural studies. At this pH, the integrity of the AKAP interaction is still intact according to RII overlay techniques (50Carr D.W. Scott J.D. Trends Biochem.

The two-dimensional1H-15N HSQC of RIIα-(1–44) is shown in Fig. 4. All 41 non-proline backbone resonances that were expected (excluding the N-terminal histidine) were observed. The number of cross-peaks in this experiment is equivalent to the number of backbone resonances expected for the monomer of RIIα-(1–44), which suggests a stable, symmetric homodimer conformation. The difficulty in distinguishing inter- from intraresidue NOE cross-peaks in a dimeric system led us to use triple resonance techniques to complete sequential backbone resonance assignments. Comparison of the intraresidue1HN, 15N to13Cα/13Cβ connectivities observed in the CT-HNCA and the HNCACB three-dimensional spectra with the sequential intraresidue 1HN, 15N to13Cα/13Cβ connectivities observed in CBCA(CO)NH and CT-HN(CO)CA data allowed nearly complete identification of sequential connectivities. A series of the1HN, 15N to 13Cα connectivities obtained in the CT-HNCA experiment for residues 8–17 is presented in Fig. 5. The combined spectra allowed for assignment of 15N and1HN resonances for 41 of 42 expected residues (98% of backbone amides), 13Cα and1Hα resonances for 44 of 46 (96%) residues, and 13Cβ and 1Hβfor 41 (93%) of the non-glycine residues.13Cα chemical shifts used in secondary structure prediction (see below) were measured with the higher resolution CT-HNCA and CT-HN(CO)CA experiments.Figure 5Correlation of residues Gly8-Thr17 of RIIα-(1–44) from the three-dimensional CT-HNCA experiment.

Aortic SMC were isolated from transgenic mice showing single inactivations of the t-PA, u-PA, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, or urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (u-PAR) genes. With regard to serum-induced proliferation, all cell types showed similar responses. However, SMC isolated from t-PA-deficient mice did not proliferate or migrate in response to PDGF, whereas SMC isolated from u-PA-deficient animals appeared to be much less sensitive to bFGF than the cells isolated from the other animals. Supplementation of cells from deficient animals with exogenous murine t-PA or u-PA restored the normal response of the growth factors with regard to both migration and proliferation. The mitogenic and chemotactic responses of bFGF were specifically inhibited in u-PAR-deficient cells or in wild-type SMC, cultured in the presence of antibodies to u-PAR. The role of u-PA and t-PA in bFGF and PDGF-induced growth and migration of SMC was not dependent on plasmin generation and activity as demonstrated by the inactivity of ε-aminocaproic acid and aprotinin. A 4–5-fold increase in the steady-state levels of u-PA and t-PA mRNA and proteins were observed after 24 h of incubation of the cell cultures with bFGF and PDGF-BB, respectively. These results therefore indicate that, at least in vitro, t-PA is an important element of the activity of PDGF-BB with regard to the proliferation and migration of SMC whereas u-PA is a key factor in the effect of bFGF on SMC.

Although the general contribution of thrombosis to the development of atherosclerosis has been acknowledged for a long time, recent investigations suggested that the fibrinolytic system may also play an important role in the process of cell proliferation or migration (3Carmeliet P. Collen D. Fibrinolysis. 1996; 10: 195-213Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 4Van Leeuwen R.T.J. Fibrinolysis. 1996; 10: 59-74Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Indeed, several authors described both a mitogenic and a chemotactic effect of two types of plasminogen activators: t-PA and u-PA for several cell types including vascular smooth muscle cells (5Herbert J.M.

Physiol. 1993; 154: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) showed that both u-PA and t-PA produced by endothelial cells were sequestered in an active form by the subendothelial extracellular matrix suggesting that they may participate in sequential matrix degradation during cell invasion but also function in the release of extracellular matrix-bound growth factor-like bFGF, that will stimulate SMC growth, a crucial step in atherogenesis or post-percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty restenosis. Most interesting were the works of Clowes et al. (7Clowes A.W. Clowes M.M. Au Y.P.T. Reidy M.A. Belin D. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) showing that vascular SMCs express u-PA during mitogenesis and t-PA during migration in balloon-injured rat carotid artery. These data which suggested that both u-PA and t-PA might have specific functions related to SMC proliferation and migration during atherosclerosis were recently confirmed by the same authors (11Clowes A.W.

Chem. 1992; 267: 3438-3444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who provided further evidence for the involvement of both u-PA and t-PA in the myointimal hyperplasia following endothelial injury. Moreover, the recent gene transfer and gene targeting studies performed on mice for several fibrinolytic components such as t-PA, u-PA, PAI-1, u-PAR, and plasminogen provided further evidence for the major role played by these factors in the process leading to neointima formation and atherosclerosis (3Carmeliet P. Collen D. Fibrinolysis. 1996; 10: 195-213Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These studies provided direct genetic evidence for a significant role of fibrinolytic enzymes in vascular wound healing and arterial neointima formation after injury, most likely by affecting cellular migration and proliferation (3Carmeliet P. Collen D. Fibrinolysis. 1996; 10: 195-213Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Carmeliet, P., Van Vlaenderen, I., Ploplis, V., Moons, L., Plow, E. & Collen, D. (1997) J. Clin.

Homozygous t-PA−/−, u-PA−/−, PAI-1−/−, and u-PAR−/− mice were obtained and characterized as described previously (3Carmeliet P. Collen D.

Thromb. Res. 1987; 46: 793-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, media fragments of the aorta were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C in DMEM containing 0.15% collagenase, 5% FCS, penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and glutamine (4 mm). After incubation, SMCs were sedimented by gentle centrifugation (400 × g for 10 min), resuspended in DMEM + 10% FCS, and grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Culture medium (DMEM + 10% FCS) was changed every 3 days and a confluent SMC monolayer was obtained after about 7 days. Cells were routinely used from the third to the sixth passage. Cells were plated sparsely (104 cells/well) in 24-well cluster plates (Nunc, Denmark) in DMEM + 0.5% FCS. After 3 days, fresh medium and the different concentrations of FCS, PDGF, or bFGF (Sigma, L'isle d'Abeau, France) were added to the growth-arrested cells. After 3 days in culture, cells were detached from triplicate wells by trypsin treatment (0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA) and counted in a Coulter counter (Coultronics, France). Wound assays were performed as described previously (17Sato Y. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1199-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent monolayers of SMC in 35-mm dishes were wounded with a razor blade. After wounding, the cells were washed with PBS and further incubated for 20 h at 37 °C in DMEM containing 0.1% gelatin and increasing concentrations of FCS, bFGF, or PDGF. The cells were then fixed with absolute methanol and stained with Giemsa. Cells that had migrated from the edge of the wound were counted in seven successive 125-μm increments at 100 × magnification using a light microscope with an ocular grid. The cell numbers represent the mean determined from six different fields. Levels of t-PA and u-PA in the conditioned media were determined with specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using monoclonal antibodies against the murine proteins which were produced in gene-deficient mice (18Declerck P.J. Carmeliet P. Verstreken M. De Cock F. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8397-8400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To evaluate the levels of t-PA and u-PA mRNA in SMC, total cellular RNA was isolated from 5 × 106 cells according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar) and u-PA and t-PA mRNA expression was analyzed by Northern blotting. Samples were size-fractionated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels containing 7.5% formaldehyde. Capillary transfer to Nylon N+ (Amersham, United Kingdom) was performed overnight in standard saline citrate. Hybridizations were carried out at 42 °C for 18 h in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 1 mNaCl, 10 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA). Nick-translated labeled cDNA were used as hybridization probes for t-PA and u-PA as already described (11Clowes A.W. Clowes M.M. Kirkam T.R. Jackson C.L. Au Y.P.T. Kenagy R.D. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 1128-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Washes were performed at room temperature in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and finally at 60 °C in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. Filters were rehybridized with a probe for human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a control for the amount of RNA in each lane and washed in the same conditions as above. Autoradiograms were obtained by exposure of filters to Amersham MP films at −80 °C using two intensifying screens. Values shown are means ± S.D. Statistical significant differences between groups were calculated by analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni correction. Statistical values were considered significant with a p < 0.05 value. When added to growth-arrested aortic SMCs of control mice, FCS exhibited a dose-dependent mitogenic effect (Fig.1 A). A similar mitogenic effect was observed with regard to the SMC isolated from mice deficient in t-PA, u-PA, PAI-1, or u-PAR. With regard to bFGF-induced SMC proliferation, all cell types responded normally compared with controls except SMC isolated from u-PA- or u-PAR-deficient mice which did not proliferate in response to bFGF (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, all SMC types showed similar proliferative responses in the presence of increasing concentrations of PDGF-BB except SMC isolated from t-PA-deficient mice which did not proliferate in response to PDGF-BB. As shown in Table I, similar results were observed concerning the migratory response of SMC to bFGF or PDGF-BB. Indeed, SMC isolated from u-PA−/− or u-PAR−/− animals did not migrate in response to bFGF whereas SMC isolated from t-PA-deficient animals appeared to be much less sensitive to PDGF-BB than the cells isolated from the other animals.Table IMigratory response of SMC isolated from transgenic miceCellsbFGF (100 ng/ml)PDGF (100 ng/ml)Wild-type420 ± 10430 ± 15t-PA−/−430 ± 2040 ± 10*u-PA−/−25 ± 5*415 ± 20PAI-1−/−425 ± 15420 ± 30u-PAR−/−20 ± 5*425 ± 15Values mean cell numbers ± S.D. of migrating cells as determined under “Materials and Methods” (n = 6).p < 0.05 versus wild-type by analysis of variance. Open table in a new tab Values mean cell numbers ± S.D. of migrating cells as determined under “Materials and Methods” (n = 6).p < 0.05 versus wild-type by analysis of variance. As shown in Figs. 2,A and B, when a polyclonal antibody which neutralized the activity of t-PA was added in the presence of PDGF-BB, both the mitogenic and the chemotactic responses of cells isolated from wild-type animals were selectively inhibited. Similarly, a polyclonal antibody directed against u-PA reduced bFGF-induced proliferation and migration of control SMCs and did not affect the responses of these cells to PDGF-BB. Preliminary experiments had demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies selectively and completely abolished the PA activity evaluated in a chromogenic assay of both purified enzymes and conditioned media of FCS-treated wild-type SMC. We then determined if supplementation of t-PA- or u-PA-deficient SMC by purified exogenous fibrinolytic enzymes would affect their mitogenic and chemotactic response of bFGF or PDGF-BB. For that purpose, proliferation and migration of SMC from u-PA- or t-PA-deficient mice was measured in the presence of bFGF or PDGF-BB and exogenous murine u-PA and t-PA prepared as described (15Carmeliet P. Schoonjans L. Kieckens L. Ream B. Degen J. Bronson R. De Vos R. Van den Oord J.J. Collen D. Mulligan R.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). As shown in Figs.3, A and B, the addition of exogenous u-PA to u-PA-deficient cells and of t-PA to t-PA-deficient cells restored both the mitogenic and chemotactic response of bFGF and PDGF-BB, respectively. This effect was highly specific since the addition of exogenous t-PA did not restore the response of u-PA-deficient cells to bFGF and the addition of u-PA did not restore the mitogenic and chemotactic activity of PDGF-BB for t-PA−/− cells (Fig. 3, A andB). To further investigate the ability of u-PAR to modulate bFGF-induced SMC growth and migration, we performed blocking experiments in the presence or absence of an antibody to u-PAR known to inhibit the binding of u-PA to u-PAR (20Todd III, R.F. Barnathan E.S. Bohuslav J. Schlossman A. Leukocyte Typing V: White Cell Differentiation Antigens. Oxford University Press, Oxford, England1995: 111-127Google Scholar). This monoclonal antibody (number 3936 from American Diagnostica) which cross-reacted with murine u-PAR (not shown), inhibited bFGF-induced SMC growth and migration when tested at 25 μg/ml (87 and 79% inhibition, respectively; p < 0.001). The present data are consistent with a possible role of u-PAR in signal transduction and/or plasmin generation. It is noteworthy that this monoclonal antibody did not affect PDGF-induced SMC growth and migration (not shown). Since clearance of protease-inhibitor complexes from the cell surface has been postulated to be a critical cell function that may enable returning unoccupied urokinase receptors to the cell surface and since u-PA/PAI-1, t-PA/PAI-1, and scu-PA have been demonstrated to be internalized via the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) (21Stahl A. Mueller B.M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3066-3071PubMed Google Scholar, 22Waltz D.A. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14746-14750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Okada S.S. Grobmyer S.R. Barnathan E.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that LRP function may be necessary for SMC migration and growth. When we incubated SMC with an anti-LRP antibody (25 μg/ml, American Red Cross) we found that specific inhibition of LRP significantly inhibited bFGF-induced migration and growth of wild-type SMC (35 and 44% inhibition, respectively,p < 0.05) but totally abrogated the effect of PDGF-BB with regard to both the migration and growth of control SMC (98 and 89% inhibition, respectively, p < 0.001). These observation shows that, 1) as suggested by others (24Grobmyer S.R. Kuo A. Orishimo M. Okada S.S. Cines D.B. Barnathan E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13291-13300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the importance of LRP in SMC migration and growth may enable the return of functional unoccupied u-PARs to the cell surface, 2) that the effect of PDGF-BB on growth and migration of SMC occurs via the binding and internalization of t-PA by LRP on SMC, and 3) LRP plays a similar role for t-PA as for u-PA in binding and internalization of t-PA alone or complexed with PAI-1, and recycling of t-PA binding sites/receptors, but this latter mechanism needs to be further defined. Since we have previously demonstrated that both the mitogenic and chemotactic responses of SMC to bFGF and PDGF-BB were related to the presence and/or activity of u-PA and t-PA, we determined if these growth factors affected the expression of these fibrinolytic enzymes in growth-arrested wild-type SMC. As shown in Fig. 4 and TableII, no significant modifications of the level of u-PA protein and mRNA were observed in PDGF-treated cultures of SMC. Similarly, the addition of bFGF did not affect the level of t-PA mRNA and protein but, on the contrary, when bFGF was added, a strong increase of steady state levels of u-PA mRNA and protein was observed in wild-type SMC (Fig. 4) but also in SMC from transgenic animals (Table II). These observations confirm previous results showing that the addition of exogenous bFGF to endothelial cells induced a rapid increase in steady-state levels of both u-PA mRNA and protein (8Odekon L.E. Sato Y. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 25Kounnis M.Z. Henkin J. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol.

Similarly the addition of PDGF to SMC resulted in a significant modification of the levels of both t-PA protein and transcript (Fig. 4 and Table II). It is noteworthy that, under basal conditions, in the absence of the specific gene, there was no compensatory changes in other closely related genes (not shown).Table IIEffect of bFGF and PDGF on the expression of t-PA and u-PA by SMCCellsbFGF (10 ng/ml)PDGF (100 ng/ml)u-PAt-PAu-PAt-PAWild-type22 ± 34 ± 16 ± 221 ± 3t-PA−/−25 ± 6BDL2-aBDL, below detection limits.5 ± 2BDLu-PA−/−BDL8 ± 1BDL23 ± 3PAI-1−/−21 ± 45 ± 25 ± 121 ± 3u-PAR−/−25 ± 39 ± 26 ± 322 ± 4Values expressed in nanograms/105 cells are mean ± S.D.

The requisite role of bFGF and PDGF-induced u-PA and t-PA expression in SMC growth and migration was further defined by the results of the experiment illustrated in Fig.5 which shows that the addition of ε-aminocaproic acid or aprotinin at doses which abrogated the activity of plasmin were unable to inhibit cell growth and movement induced by these growth factors. These results, in agreement with those published by us and others (5Herbert J.M. Lamarche I. Prabonnaud V. Dol F. Gauthier T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3076-3080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Odekon L.E. Sato Y. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 27Pepper M.S. Montesano R. Cell Diff. Dev. 1990; 32: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) show that the receptor binding but not the plasminogenolytic activity of t-PA and u-PA was necessary for their ability to stimulate growth and migration of vascular cells and demonstrate that this effect does not occur through the generation of plasmin by t-PA and u-PA. To determine if the catalytic activity of t-PA and u-PA was necessary for the mitogenic and chemotactic activity of bFGF and PDGF, the effect of PAI-1 and α1-antitrypsin, both natural inhibitors of these fibrinolytic enzymes, was tested. As shown in Fig.6, these two proteins reduced in a dose-dependent manner the mitogenic and chemotactic activity of PDGF but did not affect that of bFGF therefore suggesting that, although the activity of these growth factors did not occur through the generation of plasmin by the PAs, the catalytic activity of t-PA but not that of u-PA was necessary for its ability to stimulate migration and growth. Although vascular SMC hyperplasia is now considered a key event in atherogenesis, specific regulatory mechanisms for cell proliferation in the arterial wall are still poorly characterized. While in vitro studies with vascular SMCs have identified several agents that stimulate their proliferation in culture, growth factors responsible for vascular injury-induced intimal SMC replication have only begun to be identified.

Clowes M.M. Au Y.P.T. Reidy M.A. Belin D. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) showing that u-PA was expressed by vascular SMC during mitogenesis and t-PA during migration in an injured rat carotid artery. These authors suggested that these plasminogen activators may act on SMC growth and migration through their ability to convert plasminogen into plasmin which degraded extracellular matrix glycoproteins and released active heparan sulfate-bFGF complexes that activated SMC growth (37Saksela O. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Biol. 1990; 110: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis did not take into account a direct effect of plasminogen activators such as u-PA or t-PA on the SMC proliferation or migration processes. In that respect, we reported for the first time a direct and selective mitogenic activity of t-PA for SMC (5Herbert J.M. Lamarche I. Prabonnaud V. Dol F. Gauthier T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3076-3080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) raising the possibility of a direct active role of the fibrinolytic system in vascular SMC replication following injury. More recently, targeted gene manipulation and transfer of the plasminogen system performed in mice for several fibrinolytic components such as t-PA, u-PA, PAI-1, u-PAR, and plasminogen confirmed the major role played by these factors during neointima formation and atherosclerosis (3Carmeliet P. Collen D. Fibrinolysis. 1996; 10: 195-213Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Carmeliet, P., Van Vlaenderen, I., Ploplis, V., Moons, L., Plow, E. & Collen, D. (1997) J. Clin. Invest., in press.Google Scholar).2 In the present work, using SMC isolated from these animals, we provide evidence that the induction of u-PA and t-PA are fundamental mechanistic components of SMC migration and growth induced by bFGF and PDGF-BB, respectively. Several works already reported that the induction of u-PA was observed in migrating endothelial cells after wounding was dependent on endogenous bFGF (8Odekon L.E. Sato Y. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and that bFGF induced up-regulation of u-PA expression in endothelial cells by acting both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional/translational levels (38Gualandris A. Presta M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 400-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Our works confirm these observations, provide the first evidence for the selectivity of such an effect for u-PA, and extend these observations to another important growth factor: PDGF-BB which selectively induced an up-regulation of t-PA mRNA and protein in SMC. Basic FGF and PDGF-BB have been shown to affect the transcription of several genes in different cell types. A partial list includes nerve growth factor receptor in neuroblastoma cells (39Taiji M.

One important result of our present work is the high level of selectivity observed for bFGF and PDGF to induce the expression and release of u-PA and t-PA, respectively, but the underlying molecular mechanisms of this particular observation will have to be investigated thoroughly. Although the data shown in the present work correspond to the general idea of different functions of u-PA and t-PA during neointima formation or during the atherosclerosis process (7Clowes A.W. Clowes M.M. Au Y.P.T. Reidy M.A. Belin D. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 45Levin E.G. Loskutoff D.J. Thromb.

Collen, submitted for publication. therefore showing that u-PA plays a significant role in vascular wound healing and arterial neointima formation after injury, most likely by affecting cellular migration. Indeed, the role of u-PA in cell movement has been the object of several studies showing spacial and/or temporal changes in u-PA in migrating cells (8Odekon L.E. Sato Y. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 49Morioka S. Lazarus G.S. Baird J.L. Jensen P.J. J. Invest.

These studies suggested that u-PA expression was part of the program associated with onset of proliferation and migration and may at times be absolutely necessary for migration between tissue compartments. Our data demonstrate that, in response to a specific stimulus (bFGF), SMCs are capable of increased expression of u-PA and confirm the relation existing between proliferation, migration, and u-PA expression. A similar observation of u-PA as a mechanistic component of bFGF-induced migration has already been made for endothelial cells (8Odekon L.E. Sato Y. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and supports the conclusion drawn by several authors suggesting that the expression of u-PA is absolutely required for SMC proliferation and migration in vivofollowing vascular injury (6More R.S. Underwood M.J. Brack M.J. de Bono D.P. Gershlick A.H. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 29: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 7Clowes A.W. Clowes M.M. Au Y.P.T. Reidy M.A. Belin D. Circ.

Schleef R. Loskutoff D.J. Blood. 1987; 70: 721-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).2 In addition to the stimulatory effects of u-PA and t-PA, these studies demonstrate an important modulatory role for u-PAR and LRP in both SMC migration and growth. SMC isolated from u-PAR-deficient mice did not respond to bFGF and antibodies to u-PAR were able to inhibit both bFGF-induced migration and proliferation of SMC even when aprotinin and ε-aminocaproic acid could not, suggesting that u-PAR may modulate migration/invasion in a plasmin-independent fashion. Interestingly, a similar observation demonstrating a possible role of u-PA, independent of plasmin production, in cell adhesion and migration has been recently described (53Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). In our study PAI-1 and α1-antitrypsin, both inhibitors of the catalytic activity of u-PA did not show any effect on bFGF-induced SMC migration/growth, therefore suggesting that single binding to u-PAR may be adequate to initiate signal transduction. These studies also demonstrate a role for LRP in cell migration/growth induced by both bFGF (through u-PA) and PDGF-BB (through t-PA). This concept was supported by experiments that demonstrated inhibition of growth and migration by antibodies. Whether this effect of antibodies was related to diminished unoccupied u-PAR as suggested by Okada et al.(23Okada S.S. Grobmyer S.R. Barnathan E.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) in another experimental system or any other reason remains, however, to be investigated. In that respect, altered expression of LRP and u-PAR may also significantly affect the vascular response to injury as suggested by Watanabe et al. (54Watanabe Y. Inaba T. Shimano H. Gotoda T. Yamamoto K. Mokuno H. Sato H. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1000-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) who demonstrated up-regulation of LRP mRNA in aortas of rabbits that were fed a high-cholesterol diet and by Lupu et al. (55Lupu F. Heim D. Bachmann F. Kruithof E.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1438-1444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who demonstrated both mRNA and protein in normal and atherosclerotic human arteries. Moreover, Noda-Heiny et al. (56Noda-Heiny H. Daugherty A. Sobel B.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) demonstrated increased vessel expression of u-PAR in cholesterol-fed rabbits and human atherosclerotic arteries. Our data therefore suggest that, since they may modulate the activity of u-PA and t-PA, both u-PAR and LRP may also regulate bFGF- and PDGF-induced SMC migration and proliferation. We have previously reported that t-PA exhibits a direct and selective mitogenic activity for SMCs (5Herbert J.M. Lamarche I. Prabonnaud V. Dol F. Gauthier T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3076-3080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As observed in this work, this effect occurred at physiological concentrations of t-PA and was not mediated by t-PA-generated plasmin because plasmin inhibitors did not alter t-PA-induced SMC growth. Moreover, as already found for the mitogenic activity of t-PA for SMC, the catalytic activity of the enzyme was necessary for promotion of PDGF-induced t-PA-mediated migration and growth of SMC. Indeed, PDGF-induced SMC growth and migration was strongly affected by PAI-1, or α1-antitrypsin, both natural inhibitors of t-PA, but also by synthetic compounds such as diisofluoropropyl or Pefabloc-TPA (not shown), for all of which a good correlation between their inhibition of the catalytic activity of the enzyme and the mitogenic activity of PDGF was demonstrated. This observation suggests that SMC may possess a t-PA receptor analogous to the SMC thrombin or factor Xa receptors which exhibits a proteolytic mechanism of receptor activation (34Gasic G.P.

The fact that PAI-1 has been shown to be expressed by SMC following PDGF, transforming growth factor β, bFGF, or thrombin stimulation (58Reilly C.F. McFall R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9419-9427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 59Gelehrter T.G. Sznycer-Laszuk R. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), together with the identification of a functionally active PAI-1 accessible to t-PA, identified in the extracellular matrix of cultured endothelial cells and SMC (9Schleef R. Podor T. Dunne E. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell. Biol. 1990; 110: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10Korner G. Bjornsson T.D. Vlodavsky I. J. Cell.

Nachman R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1082-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) gives an added dimension to our observation showing that PAI-1 inhibited the mitogenic effect of t-PA. Indeed, it suggests that SMCs might thereby regulate their own plasminogen activators in an autocrine fashion. Such an hypothesis is reinforced by a recent paper (10Korner G. Bjornsson T.D. Vlodavsky I. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) showing that, within the extracellular matrix of cultured SMCs, a large proportion of the endogenous resident t-PA is accounted for by binding to PAI-1, forming a stable complex in the extracellular matrix. Complex formation of t-PA with PAI-1 may serve to localize, concentrate, and protect t-PA activity on the cell surface and within the matrix, thereby providing a reservoir of PA activity. Moreover, although we did not observe differences in either the mitogenic or chemotactic responses of SMCs isolated from PAI-1-deficient mice to bFGF or PDGF (Fig. 1, Table I), neointima formation following vascular injury was accelerated in PAI-1-deficient mice 4P. Carmeliet, L. Moons, M. Dewerchin, J. Stassen, C. Declercq, R. Gerard, and D. Collen, submitted for publication. suggesting that indeed, PAI-1 might act as a regulator of the activity of t-PA but also of u-PA which role in neointima formation has been demonstrated.3 In conclusion, our work represents the first evidence for the possible involvement of fibrinolytic enzymes in the mitogenic and chemotactic effects of growth factors on vascular SMCs and raises the interesting possibility of an active role of the fibrinolytic system in vascular smooth muscle replication and movement following injury. Taken together, these results suggest that t-PA and u-PA may play major roles in intimal hyperplasia following vascular injury but additional studies are now required to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which t-PA and u-PA act on SMC proliferation and migration in vivo. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to propose that antagonism of t-PA and u-PA expression and/or activity within the vessel wall may be of therapeutical relevance in vascular occlusive disorders such as atherosclerosis and restenosis following balloon angioplasty or stent placement."

This treatment augmented the sensitivity to ensuing hydrogen peroxide exposure for 30 min. The by nutrient deprivation-increased autophagocytosis was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and uptake of the lysosomotropic weak base acridine orange within the intracellular acidic vacuolar apparatus. The desferrioxamine-available pool of iron increased 2.5-fold during deprivation, compared with control cells. Furthermore, amino acid deprivation increased the cellular protein turnover, measured by radioactive labeling with [3H]Leu. Exposure to 40 μm ascorbic acid specifically decreased the turnover of ferritin, as estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and prevented an increase of the desferrioxamine-available iron pool, resulting in protection against hydrogen peroxide-induced cell killing.Thus, hepatocytes with nutrient deprivation-enhanced autophagocytosis contain a larger pool of catalytically active iron than control cells. This iron pool is mainly derived from the turnover (autophagocytosis) of cytosolic ferritin and is probably situated in the lysosomes. Furthermore, nutrient-deprived cells show augmented sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress, since the enhanced availability of iron in low molecular weight form results in an increased potential of intralysosomal Fenton chemistry, that may cause lysosomal rupture with release of potent hydrolytic enzymes.

Iron is the most abundant transition metal in living organisms and is absorbed, transported, and stored in a controlled manner to prevent the catalytic breakdown of peroxides by ferrous iron in Fenton-like reactions (1Graf E. Mahoney J.R. Bryant R.G. Eaton J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3620-3624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bulk of iron is stored as a core of Fe(OH)3 in ferritin, and in this form it is thought to be protected from reduction (2Balla G. Jacob H.S. Balla J. Rosenberg M. Nath K. Apple F. Eaton J.W. Vercellotti G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18148-18153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, iron is required for numerous metallo-enzymes and the synthesis of heme, and little is known about how iron gets from the intracellular stores to the biochemical systems involved in biosynthesis. It is generally assumed that such mobilized iron is located in an intracellular low molecular weight pool, where it is weakly chelated and thus more easily available for reducing substances to its ferrous form during, e.g. oxidative stress (1Graf E. Mahoney J.R. Bryant R.G. Eaton J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3620-3624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Floyd R.A. Lewis C.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2645-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that ferrous iron can be reductively released from ferritin during oxidative stress, which makes ferritin a potentially hazardous biomolecule under pathological conditions (4Rief D.W. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1992; 12: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 5Aust S.D. Chignell C.F. Bray T.M. Kalyanaraman B. Mason R.P. Toxicol. Appl.

Release of cytoplasmic iron, presumably from ferritin, has also been shown during ischemia in isolated rat hearts, due to the accumulation of acidic products in the tissue during anaerobiosis (8Voogd A. Sluiter W. van Eijk H.G. Koster J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2050-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The importance of catalytically active iron in oxidative stress-induced cell killing has been shown in several studies (9Starke P.E. Farber J.L. J. Biol.

Med. 1995; 19: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).In addition to cytosolic iron, iron also occurs in the lysosomal apparatus as a result of the autophagic degradation of iron-containing proteins (15Brun A. Brunk U. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1970; 18: 820-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 16Sakaida I. Kyle M.E. Farber J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 435-442PubMed Google Scholar, 17Starke P.E. Gilbertson J.D. Farber J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 133: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This source of low molecular weight iron, so far not very well recognized, has lately been shown to be far more active in the cell-damaging processes caused by oxidative stress than is generally believed (11Brunk U.T. Zhang H. Roberg K. Öllinger K. Redox Rep. 1995; 1: 267-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Öllinger K. Brunk U.T. Free Radical Biol.

In this context it is noteworthy that DFX is taken up into cultured cells by endocytosis rather than by diffusion (14Öllinger K. Brunk U.T. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 19: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 19Lloyd J.B. Cable H. Rice-Evans C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 1361-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Consequently, DFX will be located primarily in the secondary acidic vacuolar apparatus of the cell.Ascorbic acid was recently shown to retard the degradation of ferritin in K562 erythroleukemia cells by reducing its autophagocytotic degradation (20Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14773-14778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This effect seems to be quite specific and does not affect general protein turnover. This property of ascorbic acid was initially suggested by Bridges and Hoffman (21Bridges K.R. Hoffman K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14273-14277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to increase the availability of iron to various chelators. On the contrary, Sakaidaet al. (16Sakaida I. Kyle M.E. Farber J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 435-442PubMed Google Scholar) showed that ascorbic acid protected hepatocytes from tert-butylhydroperoxide-induced oxidative cell killing by reducing the turnover of ferritin rather than by acting as a radical scavenger.In the present study we show that nutrient deprivation-increased autophagy in primary cultures of hepatocytes causes an increase in the intracellular pool of DFX-available iron causing an increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide. This probably occurs through increased turnover of ferritin, as well as other iron-containing proteins, resulting in enhanced intralysosomal iron-catalyzed oxidative reactions.DISCUSSIONThe autophagocytotic activity of hepatocytes was increased in a pronounced way by amino acid and serum deprivation, as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy and AO uptake. Furthermore, there was an increased turnover of cellular proteins and the DFX-available pool of iron was increased 2.5-fold. Even if amino acid deprivation is probably not a physiological condition, it was here used as a way to induce general autophagocytotic degradation. In the acidic autophagolysosomes, protein-bound iron is released and chelated in various low molecular weight chelates where the iron may be catalytically active. The ATP level was slightly increased during the deprivation period, which indicates that the mitochondrial function was maintained, a prerequisite for the autophagic process (33Schellens J.P.M.

A constant energy level would also keep the cytosolic pH stable, which means that accumulation of acidic products would not cause the release of iron from cytosolic ferritin (8Voogd A. Sluiter W. van Eijk H.G. Koster J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2050-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 34Ozaki M. Fuchinoue S. Teraoka S. Ota K. Transplant. Proc. 1994; 26: 918-921PubMed Google Scholar). However, the intracellular level of GSH was decreased during deprivation, but since the energy level was sustained, this might be due to a lack of cysteine.There was no change in the total iron content of the cells during the nutrient deprivation, and, thus, a redistribution of intracellular iron in favor of a more available pool has obviously occurred. The low molecular weight iron pool is estimated to be 0.2–3% of the total iron content (35Gower J. Healing G. Green C. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1989; 5: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 36Linder C.M. Mulligan M. Henley D. Urushizaki I. Structure and Functions of Iron Storage and Transport Proteins. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1983: 465-471Google Scholar). In this study we found that 2.7% of the total iron content of control cells was available to DFX. However, it is not likely that all detected DFX-available iron is drawn from a pool of iron in the form of low molecular weight chelates. Gower et al. (26Gower J.D. Healing G. Green C.D. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have shown that DFX is also able to remove iron from ferritin to some degree, in a time-dependent manner. About 1–2% of ferritin-bound iron is released per hour upon incubation of 1 mg/ml ferritin with 2 mm DFX. Therefore, we assume an overestimation of low molecular weight iron using the DFX technique. Nevertheless, no attempt was made to correct for ferritin-derived iron, since the rate of release has been shown constant (26Gower J.D. Healing G. Green C.D. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and since the pH inside the autophagic vacuome was found constant during the study. Thus, we expect the release rate to be the same in controls and in nutrient-deprived cultures.The cellular toxicity of hydrogen peroxide has been explained as a cascade of biological oxidations resulting in a rapid modification of cytoplasmic constituents, depletion of intracellular GSH and ATP, decrease in NAD+ level, increase in free cytosolic Ca2+, and initiation of lipid peroxidation (9Starke P.E.

Most importantly, hydrogen peroxide is a potential source of one of the most dangerous radical known, the hydroxyl radical, through the Fenton reaction. This study, and several others, have lately shown that increase of cellular iron content obtained by exposing cell cultures to Fe3+ will lead to a higher probability for hydroxyl radical formation and, thus, increased oxidative damage (12Latour I. Pregaldien J.-L. Buc-Calderon P. Arch. Toxicol. 1992; 66: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 37Hyslop P.A. Hinshaw D.B. Halsey Jr., W.A. Schrafstätter I.U. Sauerheber R.D. Spragg R.G. Jackson J.H. Cochrane C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1665-1675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversion of intracellular iron to a more redox active form would result in increased risk of oxidative damage (8Voogd A. Sluiter W. van Eijk H.G. Koster J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2050-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 26Gower J.D. Healing G. Green C.D. Anal.

Since the turnover of ferritin is very rapid in the liver, it is reasonable to assume that most of the increased amounts of DFX-available iron detected was derived from ferritin. This is also confirmed by the finding that the addition of ascorbic acid diminishes not only the turnover of ferritin but also the DFX-available iron pool. The lysosomal turnover of ferritin thus seems to be the basis of iron redistribution. Redox active intralysosomal iron should be considered a very potent sensitizer of cytotoxicity during oxidative stress.Reduced glutathione acts, among other things, as a radical scavenger and as an electron donor to glutathione peroxidase, which is one of the main enzymatic pathways for hydrogen peroxide breakdown (39Jakoby W.B. Ziegler D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20715-20718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, GSH depletion in hepatocytes is not lethal as long as the energy charge is preserved (40Redegeld F.A.M. Moison R.M.W. Koster A.S. Noordhoek J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 228: 229-236PubMed Google Scholar). After nutrient deprivation the GSH level was decreased by 35%, and to evaluate the importance of such a reduction, we depleted intracellular GSH to the same level with DEM. The toxicity of hydrogen peroxide was then not significantly different from that of control cells, indicating that the major cause of increased sensitivity to oxidative stress is increased amount of intralysosmal redox active iron rather than decreased capacity to degrade hydrogen peroxide. Similar results was recently obtained with insulinoma cells subjected to nutrient deprivation and oxidative stress (41Zhang H. Öllinger K. Olenicka B. Brunk U. Redox Rep. 1996; 2: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).We conclude that autophagy in primary rat hepatocytes leads to increased pool of redox active iron, that is mainly located in secondary lysosomes, and that such iron causes enhanced sensitivity to oxidative stress. Iron is the most abundant transition metal in living organisms and is absorbed, transported, and stored in a controlled manner to prevent the catalytic breakdown of peroxides by ferrous iron in Fenton-like reactions (1Graf E. Mahoney J.R. Bryant R.G. Eaton J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3620-3624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bulk of iron is stored as a core of Fe(OH)3 in ferritin, and in this form it is thought to be protected from reduction (2Balla G. Jacob H.S. Balla J. Rosenberg M. Nath K. Apple F. Eaton J.W. Vercellotti G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18148-18153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, iron is required for numerous metallo-enzymes and the synthesis of heme, and little is known about how iron gets from the intracellular stores to the biochemical systems involved in biosynthesis. It is generally assumed that such mobilized iron is located in an intracellular low molecular weight pool, where it is weakly chelated and thus more easily available for reducing substances to its ferrous form during, e.g. oxidative stress (1Graf E. Mahoney J.R. Bryant R.G. Eaton J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3620-3624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Floyd R.A. Lewis C.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2645-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that ferrous iron can be reductively released from ferritin during oxidative stress, which makes ferritin a potentially hazardous biomolecule under pathological conditions (4Rief D.W. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1992; 12: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 5Aust S.D. Chignell C.F. Bray T.M. Kalyanaraman B. Mason R.P. Toxicol. Appl.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Release of cytoplasmic iron, presumably from ferritin, has also been shown during ischemia in isolated rat hearts, due to the accumulation of acidic products in the tissue during anaerobiosis (8Voogd A. Sluiter W. van Eijk H.G. Koster J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2050-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The importance of catalytically active iron in oxidative stress-induced cell killing has been shown in several studies (9Starke P.E. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10099-10114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Schrafstätter I.U. Hyslop P.A. Jackson J. Revak S.D. Cochrane C.C. Bull. Eur. Physiopathol.

Med. 1995; 19: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In addition to cytosolic iron, iron also occurs in the lysosomal apparatus as a result of the autophagic degradation of iron-containing proteins (15Brun A. Brunk U. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1970; 18: 820-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 16Sakaida I. Kyle M.E. Farber J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 435-442PubMed Google Scholar, 17Starke P.E. Gilbertson J.D. Farber J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 133: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This source of low molecular weight iron, so far not very well recognized, has lately been shown to be far more active in the cell-damaging processes caused by oxidative stress than is generally believed (11Brunk U.T. Zhang H. Roberg K. Öllinger K. Redox Rep. 1995; 1: 267-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Öllinger K. Brunk U.T. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 19: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 18Zhang H. Brunk U. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this context it is noteworthy that DFX is taken up into cultured cells by endocytosis rather than by diffusion (14Öllinger K. Brunk U.T. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 19: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 19Lloyd J.B. Cable H. Rice-Evans C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 1361-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Consequently, DFX will be located primarily in the secondary acidic vacuolar apparatus of the cell. Ascorbic acid was recently shown to retard the degradation of ferritin in K562 erythroleukemia cells by reducing its autophagocytotic degradation (20Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14773-14778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This effect seems to be quite specific and does not affect general protein turnover. This property of ascorbic acid was initially suggested by Bridges and Hoffman (21Bridges K.R. Hoffman K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14273-14277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to increase the availability of iron to various chelators. On the contrary, Sakaidaet al. (16Sakaida I. Kyle M.E. Farber J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 435-442PubMed Google Scholar) showed that ascorbic acid protected hepatocytes from tert-butylhydroperoxide-induced oxidative cell killing by reducing the turnover of ferritin rather than by acting as a radical scavenger. In the present study we show that nutrient deprivation-increased autophagy in primary cultures of hepatocytes causes an increase in the intracellular pool of DFX-available iron causing an increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide. This probably occurs through increased turnover of ferritin, as well as other iron-containing proteins, resulting in enhanced intralysosomal iron-catalyzed oxidative reactions. DISCUSSIONThe autophagocytotic activity of hepatocytes was increased in a pronounced way by amino acid and serum deprivation, as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy and AO uptake. Furthermore, there was an increased turnover of cellular proteins and the DFX-available pool of iron was increased 2.5-fold. Even if amino acid deprivation is probably not a physiological condition, it was here used as a way to induce general autophagocytotic degradation. In the acidic autophagolysosomes, protein-bound iron is released and chelated in various low molecular weight chelates where the iron may be catalytically active. The ATP level was slightly increased during the deprivation period, which indicates that the mitochondrial function was maintained, a prerequisite for the autophagic process (33Schellens J.P.M. Meijer A.J. Histochem. J. 1991; 23: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A constant energy level would also keep the cytosolic pH stable, which means that accumulation of acidic products would not cause the release of iron from cytosolic ferritin (8Voogd A. Sluiter W. van Eijk H.G. Koster J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2050-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 34Ozaki M. Fuchinoue S. Teraoka S. Ota K. Transplant. Proc. 1994; 26: 918-921PubMed Google Scholar). However, the intracellular level of GSH was decreased during deprivation, but since the energy level was sustained, this might be due to a lack of cysteine.There was no change in the total iron content of the cells during the nutrient deprivation, and, thus, a redistribution of intracellular iron in favor of a more available pool has obviously occurred.

However, GSH depletion in hepatocytes is not lethal as long as the energy charge is preserved (40Redegeld F.A.M. Moison R.M.W. Koster A.S. Noordhoek J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 228: 229-236PubMed Google Scholar). After nutrient deprivation the GSH level was decreased by 35%, and to evaluate the importance of such a reduction, we depleted intracellular GSH to the same level with DEM. The toxicity of hydrogen peroxide was then not significantly different from that of control cells, indicating that the major cause of increased sensitivity to oxidative stress is increased amount of intralysosmal redox active iron rather than decreased capacity to degrade hydrogen peroxide. Similar results was recently obtained with insulinoma cells subjected to nutrient deprivation and oxidative stress (41Zhang H. Öllinger K. Olenicka B. Brunk U. Redox Rep. 1996; 2: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We conclude that autophagy in primary rat hepatocytes leads to increased pool of redox active iron, that is mainly located in secondary lysosomes, and that such iron causes enhanced sensitivity to oxidative stress.

https://openalex.org/W1996813615,"Many different G protein-linked receptors are preferentially coupled to G proteins of the Gq/11family. To elucidate the molecular basis underlying this selectivity, different Gq/11-coupled receptors (m3 muscarinic, V1a vasopressin, and gastrin-releasing peptide receptor) were coexpressed (in COS-7 cells) with mutant αs subunits in which residues present at the C terminus of αs were replaced with the corresponding αq/11 residues. Remarkably, whereas none of the receptors was able to interact with wild type αs to a significant extent, all three receptors gained the ability to productively couple to a mutant αs subunit containing a single Glu → Asn point mutation at position −3. Moreover, the m3 muscarinic and the V1a vasopressin receptors but not the GRP receptor also gained the ability to interact with a mutant αs subunit containing a single Gln → Glu point mutation at position −5, indicating that the αq/11 residues present in these mutant G protein constructs play key roles in determining the selectivity of receptor recognition.To identify the site(s) on Gq/11-coupled receptors that can functionally interact with the C terminus of αq/11subunits, we next analyzed the ability of a series of hybrid m2/m3 muscarinic receptors to interact with a mutant αs subunit (sq5) in which the last five amino acids of αs were replaced with the corresponding αq/11 sequence. Similar to the wild type m2 and m3 muscarinic receptors, none of the investigated hybrid receptors was able to efficiently interact with wild type αs. Interestingly, however, three mutant m2 receptors in which different segments of the second and third intracellular loops were replaced with the corresponding m3 receptor sequences were identified, which, in contrast to the Gi/o-coupled wild type m2 receptor, gained the ability to efficiently activate the sq5 subunit. This observation suggests that multiple intracellular receptor domains form a binding pocket for the C terminus of G protein αq/11subunits.

The activated G protein subunits (α-GTP and/or free βγ) are then able to bind to and modulate the activity of downstream effector enzymes and/or ion channels.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1487-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) suggests that the C-terminal portion of the G protein α subunits, via binding to the intracellular receptor surface (12Hamm H.E.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21519-21525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is of fundamental importance for dictating the specificity of receptor-G protein interactions. Several recent studies (8Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 9Liu J. Conklin B.R. Blin N. Yun J. Wess J.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1487-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) have shown, for example, that substitution of αior αs residues into the C-terminal segment of αq subunits results in mutant G proteins that can be activated by Gi- or Gs-coupled receptors, respectively. By taking advantage of this observation, the C-terminal amino acids in αi/o subunits that are critical for proper receptor recognition have been mapped in great detail (11Kostenis E. Conklin B.R. Wess J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1487-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In contrast, the functional roles of individual amino acids present at the C termini of other classes of Gα subunits have not been studied systematically to date. To identify the site(s) on GPCRs that can functionally interact with the C terminus of αi/o subunits, we have recently used a novel experimental strategy involving the coexpression of hybrid receptors with hybrid Gα subunits. We initially showed that the wild type m2 muscarinic receptor, a prototypical Gi/o-coupled receptor (14Parker E.M. Kameyama K. Higashijima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 519-527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Peralta E.G. Ashkenazi A. Winslow J.W. Ramachandran J. Capon D.J. Nature. 1988; 334: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 16Offermanns S. Wieland T. Homann D. Sandmann J. Bombien E. Spicher K. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 890-898PubMed Google Scholar), does not efficiently interact with wild type αq but can productively couple to mutant αqsubunits in which the last five amino acids of αq were replaced with the corresponding αi or αosequences (9Liu J. Conklin B.R. Blin N. Yun J. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11642-11646Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We then demonstrated, by analyzing a large number of mutant m2 receptors, that the ability of the m2 receptor to interact with such hybrid αq subunits was critically dependent on the structural integrity of a four-amino acid motif (VTIL; Val385, Thr386, Ile389, and Leu390) predicted to be located at the C terminus of the i3 loop (9Liu J. Conklin B.R. Blin N. Yun J. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11642-11646Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 11Kostenis E. Conklin B.R. Wess J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1487-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, gain-of-function studies showed that substitution of the VTIL motif into mutant m3 muscarinic receptors (which were unable to couple to wild type αq) could confer onto these receptors the ability to efficiently couple to mutant αq containing αi or αosequences at their C terminus (9Liu J. Conklin B.R. Blin N. Yun J. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11642-11646Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These data therefore suggested that the VTIL motif can functionally interact with the C terminus of αi/o subunits and that this contact is intimately involved in determining coupling selectivity and triggering G protein activation. To investigate whether the results obtained with the Gi/o-coupled m2 muscarinic receptor are generally applicable, we recently have extended these studies to other functional classes of GPCRs and Gα subunits. In the present study, we first wanted to examine which specific amino acids present at the C terminus of αq/11 subunits are of particular importance for selective receptor recognition. Toward this goal, we systematically substituted distinct αq/11 residues into the C terminus of αs (a G protein subunit that mediates the activation of adenylyl cyclase) and studied whether the resulting mutant α subunits gained the ability to be activated by different Gq/11-coupled receptors. Remarkably, two αq/11 residues were identified which, when substituted into wild type αs, resulted in αs single point mutants that, in contrast to wild type αs, could be recognized by Gq/11-coupled receptors. The second goal of this study was to identify the site(s) on Gq/11-coupled receptors that can functionally interact with the C terminus of αq/11 subunits. To address this issue, we took advantage of the finding that the Gi/o-coupled m2 muscarinic receptor, in contrast to the Gq/11-coupled m3 muscarinic receptor (15Peralta E.G. Ashkenazi A. Winslow J.W. Ramachandran J. Capon D.J. Nature. 1988; 334: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 16Offermanns S. Wieland T. Homann D. Sandmann J. Bombien E. Spicher K. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 890-898PubMed Google Scholar), cannot functionally interact with a mutant αs subunit containing αq sequence at its C terminus. Based on this observation, mutant m2 muscarinic receptors in which distinct intracellular domains were replaced with the corresponding m3 receptor sequences were studied for their ability to gain coupling to this mutant α subunit. These coexpression experiments led to the novel finding that multiple m3 receptor regions, including residues within the i2 loop and the N- and C-terminal portions of the i3 domain, are critical for selective recognition of the C terminus of αq/11 subunits. A rat αs cDNA (17Jones D.T. Reed R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14241-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cloned into the pcDNAI expression vector (10Conklin B.R. Herzmark P. Ishida S. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A.. Sun Y. Farfel Z. Bourne H.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 885-890PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a template for PCR mutagenesis. All wild type and mutant Gαs subunits contained an internal hemagglutinin epitope tag (DVPDYAS; Refs. 18Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar and19Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The presence of the epitope tag that replaced αsresidues 76–82 did not affect the receptor and effector coupling properties of wild type αs (18Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 19Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The construction of sq5 (which codes for a mutant αs subunit in which the last five amino acids of αs were replaced with the corresponding αq sequence) has been described previously (10Conklin B.R. Herzmark P. Ishida S. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A.. Sun Y. Farfel Z. Bourne H.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 885-890PubMed Google Scholar). To introduce mutations into the C-terminal segment of αs, a 42-base pair NsiI-XbaI fragment was removed from the wild type plasmid and replaced with PCR fragments containing the desired mutations. The correctness of all PCR-derived sequences was verified by dideoxy sequencing of the mutant plasmids (20Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52667) Google Scholar). The construction of the hybrid m2/m3 muscarinic receptors used in this study has been described previously (Refs. 21Wess J. Bonner T.I. Brann M.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 872-877PubMed Google Scholar, 22Blüml K. Mutschler E. Wess J. J. Biol.

COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2incubator. For transfections, 1 × 106 cells were seeded into 100-mm dishes. About 24 h later, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with the indicated G protein and receptor constructs (0.8 μg of DNA each) by using a DEAE-dextran procedure (24Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). To reduce the expression levels of the different receptor and G protein constructs, transfection mixtures were supplemented with 2.4 μg of pcDNAI vector DNA. The following wild type receptor expression plasmids were used: human m2 muscarinic receptor in pcD (25Bonner T.I. Buckley N.J. Young A.C. Brann M.R. Science. 1987; 237: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar), rat m3 muscarinic receptor in pcD (25Bonner T.I. Buckley N.J. Young A.C. Brann M.R.

Battey, NIH), and rat V1a vasopressin receptor (27Morel A. O'Carroll A.-M. Brownstein M.J. Lolait S.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) in pcD-SP6/T7 (kindly provided by M. Brownstein, NIH). Approximately 20–24 h after transfections, cells were transferred into six-well plates, and 2 μCi/ml [3H]adenine (15 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals) was added to the growth medium. After a 24–36 h labeling period, cells were preincubated in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 20 mm Hepes and 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine for 20 min (room temperature) and then stimulated with the appropriate agonist ligands for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by aspiration of the medium and addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 1 mm ATP and 1 mm cAMP. Increases in intracellular [3H]cAMP levels were then determined by anion-exchange chromatography as described (28Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). N-[3H]Methylscopolamine (79.5 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) saturation binding experiments were carried out with membrane homogenates prepared from transfected COS-7 cells essentially as described (29Dörje F. Wess J. Lambrecht G. Tacke R. Mutschler E. Brann M.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 256: 727-733PubMed Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm atropine. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216357) Google Scholar). Binding data were analyzed by using the computer program Ligand (31Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar). All wild type and mutant Gαssubunits were detected with the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) directed against the hemagglutinin epitope tag present in all G protein constructs. Samples containing 20 μg of membrane protein prepared from transfected COS-7 cells were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%), electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with the 12CA5 antibody as described (9Liu J. Conklin B.R. Blin N. Yun J. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11642-11646Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham). [Arg8]Vasopressin was purchased from Sigma. All other ligands used in this study were obtained through Research Biochemicals Inc. All studies were carried out with COS-7 cells cotransfected with different GPCRs and Gα constructs. Initially, the ability of the rat m3 muscarinic receptor (25Bonner T.I. Buckley N.J. Young A.C. Brann M.R. Science. 1987; 237: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar), a prototypical Gq/11-coupled receptor (15Peralta E.G. Ashkenazi A. Winslow J.W. Ramachandran J. Capon D.J. Nature. 1988; 334: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 16Offermanns S. Wieland T. Homann D. Sandmann J. Bombien E. Spicher K. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 890-898PubMed Google Scholar), to interact with wild type αs (s(wt)) was examined. As expected, based on its known G protein coupling preference, the m3 muscarinic receptor, when cotransfected with s(wt) (or vector DNA as a control) and stimulated with the agonist carbachol (500 μm), did not efficiently stimulate cAMP production. The maximum increase in cAMP accumulation (above basal levels) mediated by the m3 receptor in the absence or presence of cotransfected s(wt) amounted to only 1.5–2-fold (see Fig. 2 A). However, coexpression of the m3 muscarinic receptor with a mutant αs subunit in which the last five amino acids (QYELL) were replaced with the corresponding αq sequence (EYNLV; resulting in the hybrid α subunit, sq5) led to a pronounced stimulation (6–8-fold) of adenylyl cyclase activity (see Fig.2 A). Essentially similar results were obtained with two other Gq/11-coupled receptors, the rat V1a vasopressin (27Morel A. O'Carroll A.-M. Brownstein M.J. Lolait S.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) and the mouse GRP receptor (26Battey J.F. Way J.M. Corjay M.H. Shapira H. Kusano K. Harkins R. Wu J.M. Slattery T. Mann E. Feldman R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Like the m3 receptor, these two peptide receptors, when activated by the appropriate agonist ligands ([Arg8]vasopressin (1 μm) and bombesin (1 μm)), did not couple efficiently to s(wt) (see Figs. 2,B and C). In contrast, both peptide receptors were able to productively interact with sq5, mediating 4–8-fold increases in cAMP levels in the presence of this G protein subunit (see Figs. 2, B and C). We next wanted to examine which specific amino acids within the C-terminal segment of αq/11 are of particular importance for proper receptor recognition. Toward this goal, specific residues at the C terminus of s(wt) were replaced either alone or in combination with the corresponding αq/11 residues (Fig.1). The ability of different Gq/11-coupled receptors to gain coupling to these mutant αs subunits was then examined in cotransfected COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 1, the C-terminal five amino acids of αsdiffer in only three residues from the corresponding αq/11 sequence (the leucine residue at position −2 is conserved among all mammalian α subunits, and a tyrosine residue is present at position −4 in both αsand αq/11). Therefore, three αs single point mutants, s(Q → E), s(E → N), and s(QL → EV), and all three possible αs double point mutants, s(QE → EN), s(EL → NV), and s(QL → EV), were prepared (Figs. 1 and2). Western analysis using a monoclonal antibody directed against the hemagglutinin epitope tag present in all G protein constructs (18Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 19Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) showed that all mutant αssubunits were expressed at similar levels as s(wt) and sq5 (Fig.3). Initially, the ability of the m3 muscarinic receptor to functionally interact with the different mutant αs subunits was examined (Fig. 2 A). Remarkably, the m3 receptor gained the ability to activate two αs single point mutants, s(Q → E) and s(E → N), to a significant extent. In the presence of carbachol (500 μm) and either of these two subunits, the m3 receptor was able to mediate a marked increase in adenylyl cyclase activity ((4–5-fold, as compared with an 6–8-fold increase observed with sq5) (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, coexpression of the m3 muscarinic receptor with s(L → V) did not result in a cAMP response that was significantly different from background (as determined in cells transfected with either vector DNA or s(wt)) (Fig.2 A). To examine whether the functional effects caused by the single amino acid substitutions were additive, three αs double point mutants, s(QE → EN), s(EL → NV), and s(QL → EV), were constructed and functionally analyzed. When coexpressed with the m3 muscarinic receptor, s(QE → EN) was able to mediate a cAMP response that was similar in magnitude to that observed with sq5 (Fig. 2 A), indicating that the functional effects of the Q → E and E → N point mutations were additive. In contrast, the s(EL → NV) and s(QL → EV) double point mutants showed functional responses similar to those found with s(E → N) and s(Q → E), respectively, suggesting that the C-terminal amino acid of αq/11 is not critical for receptor recognition. To study whether the results obtained with the m3 muscarinic receptor are also applicable to other Gq/11-coupled receptors, the different Gαs constructs were also coexpressed with the V1a vasopressin and the GRP receptor. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the V1a vasopressin receptor showed a functional profile that was very similar to that found with the m3 muscarinic receptor. In contrast, the activity pattern seen with the GRP peptide receptor differed somewhat from that found with the two other receptors. Similar to the m3 muscarinic and V1a vasopressin receptors, the GRP receptor gained the ability to activate s(E → N) (as well as the s(QE → EN) and s(EL → NV) double point mutants) and did not efficiently couple to s(L → V) (Fig. 2 C). However, in contrast to the two other receptors examined in this study, the GRP receptor did not interact to a significant extent with the s(Q → E) single point and the s(QL → EV) double point mutants (Fig. 2 C). The second major goal of this study was to identify the site(s) on Gq/11-coupled receptors that can functionally interact with the C terminus of αq/11 subunits. To address this question, we employed a gain-of-function mutagenesis approach, analyzing the ability of a series of hybrid m2/m3 muscarinic receptors (Fig.4) to interact with the mutant αs subunit, sq5, in which the last five amino acids of αs were replaced with the corresponding αqsequence. As shown in Fig. 5, the m2 muscarinic receptor, a prototypical Gi/o-coupled receptor, did not activate either s(wt) or sq5 to a significant extent. We thus hypothesized that substitution into the m2 receptor of the m3 receptor domain(s) capable of recognizing the C terminus of αqshould enable the resulting hybrid receptor(s) to interact with the sq5 subunit. The m2-i2, m2-Ni3, m2-Y, and m2-AALS hybrid receptors (Fig. 4) were included in this analysis because previous studies had shown that the m3 receptor regions/residues contained in these constructs are critical for efficient recognition of Gq/11 proteins (22Blüml K.

N-[3H]Methylscopolamine saturation binding studies showed that all hybrid receptors were expressed at levels similar to those found with the m2 and m3 wild type receptors (for B max values, see legend to Fig.5). Interestingly, three of the investigated hybrid receptors, m2-i2, m2-Ni3, and m2-AALS, gained the ability to productively interact with the sq5 mutant subunit, mediating 4–6-fold increases in cAMP production (Fig. 5). In contrast, none of these hybrid receptors was able to efficiently interact with s(wt). In these constructs, the i2 loop, the first 21 amino acids of the i3 domain, and a four-amino acid motif (AALS; Ala488, Ala489, Leu492, and Ser493) at the C terminus of the i3 loop were derived from the m3 muscarinic receptor.

We previously showed that TGF-β induces the transcriptional activation domain (TAD) of CTF-1, the prototypic member of the CTF/NF-I family of transcription factors. This induction correlates with the proposed role of CTF/NF-I binding sites in collagen gene induction by TGF-β. However, the mechanisms of TGF-β signal transduction remain poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the role of free calcium signaling in the induction of CTF-1 transcriptional activity by TGF-β. We found that TGF-β stimulates calcium influx and mediates an increase of the cytoplasmic calcium concentration in NIH3T3 cells. TGF-β induction of CTF-1 is inhibited in cells pretreated with thapsigargin, which depletes the endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores, thus further arguing for the potential relevance of calcium mobilization in TGF-β action. Consistent with this possibility, expression of a constitutively active form of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin or of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IV (ΔCaMKIV) specifically induces the CTF-1 TAD and the endogenous mouse CTF/NF-I proteins. Both calcineurin- and ΔCaMKIV-mediated induction require the previously identified TGF-β-responsive domain of CTF-1. The immunosuppressants cyclosporin A and FK506 abolish calcineurin-mediated induction of CTF-1 activity. However, TGF-β still induces the CTF-1 TAD in cells treated with these compounds or in cells overexpressing both calcineurin and ΔCaMKIV, suggesting that other calcium-sensitive enzymes might mediate TGF-β action. These results identify CTF/NF-I as a novel calcium signaling pathway-responsive transcription factor and further suggest multiple molecular mechanisms for the induction of CTF/NF-I transcriptional activity by growth factors.

Mermod N. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The extreme diversity of TGF-β actions is further complicated by the fact that TGF-β often elicits opposite responses, depending on the cell type and the assay conditions. The importance of TGF-β in cell physiology and pathophysiology is emphasized by the identification of several fibrotic disorders that may arise from increased TGF-β sensitivity such as arthritis (2Border W.A. Noble N.A. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1000-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), as well as by the increased tumorigenicity of several epithelial cells that have lost TGF-β responsiveness (3Markowitz S.D. Roberts A.B. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). TGF-β binds specific receptors at the cell surface, which are often composed of two dimers of distinct transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptor chains referred to as type I (TβRI) and type II (TβRII) TGF-β receptors. Following ligand binding, TβRII is thought to phosphorylate and activate the TβRI kinase, which in turn propagates the signal to downstream substrates. Genetic and biochemical analyses in nematode, fruit fly, and primate cells led to the identification of several putative TGF-β signal transducers, including various proteins interacting with the TGF-β receptor complex and a family of related factors collectively referred to as the Smad proteins (1Alevizopoulos A. Mermod N. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 4Massagué J. Cell. 1996; 85: 947-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Some of the Smads were shown to influence known aspects of TGF-β signaling, which led to the proposal that they may act as bona fide TGF-β effectors. For example, Smad3 and Smad4 are necessary and sufficient for specific TGF-β-mediated growth and transcriptional responses in Mv1Lu cells (5Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar), whereas Smad2 participates in the transcriptional induction of the Mix.2 gene, a well known target of the activin-like members of the TGF-β superfamily (6Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Thus, individual Smads appear to play a pivotal role in relaying the signals of the various TGF-β ligands. Nevertheless, their specific functions remain unknown. Recently, a possible role for calcium in TGF-β action has been proposed (7Muldoon L.L. Rodland K.D. Magun B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18834-18841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ishiyama N. Shibata H. Kanzaki M. Shiozaki S. Miyazaki J. Kobayashi I. Kojima I. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 117: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For instance, TβRI was shown to interact with FKBP12 (9Wang T. Donahoe P.K. Zervos A.S. Science. 1994; 265: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), the prototype of the FKBP class of immunophilins (see Ref. 10Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar for review). FKBP12 is of interest, as it has the potential to inhibit the activity of the calcium-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (11Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar). In addition, FKBP12 and calcineurin may regulate the function of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and ryanodine receptors (IP3R and RyR), the major endoplasmic reticulum (ER) receptor channels controlling calcium stores (12Brillantes A.-M.B. Ondrias K. Scott A. Kobrinsky E. Ondriasova E. Moschella M.C. Jayaraman T. Landers M. Ehrlich B.E. Marks A.R.

Cell. 1995; 83: 463-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). However, whether calcineurin and other known calcium-dependent phosphatases or kinases mediate TGF-β regulation remains to be demonstrated. We have previously shown that TGF-β specifically induces the activity of the transcriptional activation domain (TAD) of CTF-1, the prototypic member of the CTF/NF-I family of proline-rich transcription factors (14Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the TGF-β-responsive domain of the CTF-1 TAD mediates histone H3 interaction and alters nucleosomal structure, suggesting that TGF-β may induce gene expression by chromatin remodeling. In addition, the TGF-β-responsive domain mediates tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) repression of basal and TGF-β-induced CTF-1 transcriptional activity (15Alevizopoulos A. Mermod N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29672-29681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This antagonistic regulation of CTF-1 activity by TGF-β and TNF-α correlates with the opposing effects of the two growth factors on the regulation of some collagen genes (16Rossi P. Karsenty G. Roberts A.B. Roche N.S. Sporn M.B. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 1988; 52: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 17Kähäri V.-M. Chen Y.Q. Su M.W. Ramirez F. Uitto J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), which may be relevant for the process of wound healing. Here, we analyzed the relevance of calcium signaling in the induction of CTF-1 transcriptional activity by TGF-β. We show that TGF-β stimulates calcium influx and mediates an increase in the free cytoplasmic calcium concentration in NIH3T3 cells. TGF-β induction of the CTF-1 TAD is inhibited in cells pretreated with thapsigargin, which interferes with calcium homeostasis, while expression of constitutive forms of calcineurin or of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IV (CaMKIV) induces CTF-1 transcriptional activity. Thus, calcium signaling may be relevant for the regulation of CTF-1 by extracellular stimuli. pG5BCAT, pαCAT-Δ87–3xAd, pαCAT-Δ55, and p3TP-Lux have been described previously (14Alevizopoulos A.

The CMV-driven mammalian expression vectors for the CTF-1 fusion protein GAL 399–499 and its derivatives GAL 399–486, GAL 486–499, GAL 479–499 (3xM), the CTF-2 fusion vector GAL 399–430 and GAL-AP2 were derived after subcloning appropriate fragments of the corresponding SV40-based vectors (14Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), in pCMV5 (19Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The untagged version of ΔCNA, a deletion mutant of the mouse CNα4 calcineurin catalytic subunit lacking the autoinhibitory and the calmodulin-binding domains, was expressed from the previously described SRα-driven vector (pSRα-ΔCaM-AI, Ref.20O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). ΔCNA was tagged at the C terminus with the hemagglutinin HA1 epitope after subcloning a 1.3-kilobase pair cDNA fragment encoding the first 398 amino acids of the protein in pCMV-HA, a modified pCMV5 vector 2A. Alevizopoulos, unpublished data. to yield pCMV-ΔCNA-HA. (The addition of the tag had no detectable effect on ΔCNA activity, hence pSRα-ΔCaM-AI and pCMV-ΔCNA-HA were used interchangeably in these studies). The ΔCNA mutant used in Fig. 2 was constructed in pCMV-HA using overlap-extension PCR mutagenesis and pSRα-ΔCaM-AI as template. It contains several point mutations that convert codons 349, 350, 356, and 357 of the CNα4 cDNA in glutamate, thereby abolishing CNB binding, as shown previously (E mutant in Ref. 21Watanabe Y. Perrino B.A. Chang B.H. Sonderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 456-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), as well as a carboxyl-terminal HA tag, as above. A 0.5-kilobase pair cDNA fragment encoding the regulatory B subunit of calcineurin was cloned from total rat brain RNA by reverse transcription PCR and appropriate primers designed after the published sequence (GeneBank™ accession number LO3554), digested with Asp-718 and EagI, and inserted between the cohesive sites of pCMV5 to yield pCMV-CNB. Oligonucleotide-mediated PCR mutagenesis of an RSV-driven expression vector encoding a truncated 313-amino acid-long catalytic domain of the mouse calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (ΔCaMKIV, which lacks the calmodulin binding and the autoinhibitory domains of wild-type CaMKIV, Ref. 22Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) was used to construct a catalytically inactive ΔCaMKIV kinase variant, after replacement of lysine 75 by glutamate (23Miranti C.K. Ginty D.D. Huang G. Chatila T. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3672-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The SRα-based mammalian expression vectors for the constitutive and the catalytically inactive variants of the γ isoform of the CaMKII kinase have been described previously (24Nghiem P. Ollick T. Gardner P. Schulman H. Nature. 1994; 371: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The CMV-CaMKI expression vector was constructed after subcloning of a 1.3-kilobase pair BamHI-EcoRI fragment encoding the complete rat cDNA sequence (from pGEX-2T-ATG92, Ref. 25Picciotto M.R. Czernik A.J. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26512-26521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the cohesive sites of pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). Correct PCR amplification of all recombinant clones was confirmed by dideoxy DNA sequencing. NIH3T3 cells were grown in standard DMEM medium supplemented with 10% donor calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and antibiotics. Cells were transiently transfected by electroporation, essentially as described (14Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4.5 × 106 cells were mixed with 70 μg of total plasmid DNA and pulsed once at 960 microfarads and 250 V at room temperature, according to the instructions of the electroporator manufacturer (Bio-Rad). The contents of one pulsed cuvette were split in two, and cells were plated in DMEM plus 0.5% donor calf serum for 3–5 h. Cultures were then induced for a period of 15 h with either ethanol vehicle or 5 ng/ml of human TGF-β1 (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). Cells were lysed in 1 × reporter lysis buffer (Promega Corp.); CAT and luciferase activities were determined using standard procedures and normalized according to β-galactosidase activity from a co-transfected internal control plasmid (CMVβgal,CLONTECH). As ΔCaMKIV slightly (<2 ×) induces CMVβgal activity, CAT activities in the experiments involving ΔCaMKIV were normalized according to the total protein concentration. For gel shift analysis of the endogenous CTF/NF-I or of the transiently expressed GAL4 fusion proteins, cells were lysed in extraction buffer (20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 500 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) as described by Martinezet al. (26Martinez E. Dusserre Y. Wahli W. Mermod N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2937-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Whole-cell lysates were normalized for protein concentration and incubated with end-labeled double-stranded DNA probes containing either the high-affinity CTF/NF-I binding site found within the first 50 base pairs of the Adenovirus origin of replication (27Armentero M.-T. Horwitz M. Mermod N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11537-11541Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or the 17-base pair GAL4 binding site (28Carey M. Kakidani H. Leatherwood J. Mostashari F. Ptashne M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Protein·DNA complexes were separated from free probe on native polyacrylamide gels and revealed by autoradiography. For45Ca2+ influx studies, 7 × 104 exponentially growing NIH3T3 cells were plated in 24-well plates and incubated in standard DMEM plus 0.5% donor calf serum overnight. Cells were washed twice with 0.5 ml of PSS buffer (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) containing 0.12 mm CaCl2, and they were then induced with 5 ng/ml of TGF-β or ethanol carrier in 0.2 ml of the same buffer at 37 °C. The cells were labeled with 1 μCi of45Ca/well at 37 °C for the last 5 min of the incubation in the presence or absence of the growth factor. The assay was terminated by aspirating the labeling medium and rinsing the cells 4 × with 0.5 ml of cold PSS buffer containing 1.2 mmCaCl2. The cells were then trypsinized, lysed in 0.25 ml of 1% SDS, and the 45Ca2+ content of the lysate was measured by liquid scintillation counting (Packard Tri Carb 4640). The cytoplasmic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+] c) was measured using fura-2 fluorescence, essentially as described (29Lo Russo A. Passaquin A.-C. André P. Skutella M. Rüegg U.T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 × 105serum-starved NIH3T3 cells plated on glass coverslips were washed twice with PSS buffer containing 1.2 mm CaCl2 and were subsequently loaded with 5 μm fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) for 40 min in the same buffer at room temperature and in the dark. The excess of fura-2 was removed by washing twice with PSS, 1.2 mm Ca2+, and the coverslip was inserted into a thermostatted chamber on a Nikon Diaphot inverted epifluorescence microscope, which is part of a PhoCal single cell fluorescence analyzer (Life Science Resources, Cambridge, UK). The cells were illuminated with alternating light of 340 and 380 nm from a rotating filter wheel. Emission was monitored at 510 nm from a field of about five cells, and the data were analyzed using PhoCal software. Calibrations were performed by treating the cells with 10 μm ionomycin plus 10 mm calcium to obtain the maximal signal, followed by the addition of 10 mm EGTA to obtain the minimal signal. Background fluorescence, obtained by quenching the signal with 1 mm MnCl2, was subtracted from the signals. [Ca2+] c was calculated based on the equation of Grynkiewicz et al. (30Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicated that the proline-rich transcriptional activation domain of CTF-1 mediates TGF-β induction in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (14Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and that the type I TGF-β receptor interacts with the immunophilin FKBP12, a protein implicated in the regulation of calcium homeostasis (9Wang T. Donahoe P.K. Zervos A.S. Science. 1994; 265: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 12Brillantes A.-M.B. Ondrias K. Scott A. Kobrinsky E. Ondriasova E. Moschella M.C. Jayaraman T. Landers M. Ehrlich B.E. Marks A.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wished to evaluate the relevance of calcium signaling in CTF-1 regulation. First, we assessed whether TGF-β is capable of mobilizing cellular calcium, by performing45Ca2+ influx studies in NIH3T3 cells (Fig.1 A). Serum-starved cells were treated with TGF-β or carrier for specific time periods, labeled with45Ca2+, and the radioactivity associated with the cells (45Ca2+ influx) was measured. Incubation of cells with TGF-β for periods under 7 min had no effect on 45Ca2+ influx. However, a significant increase in 45Ca2+ influx was observed in TGF-β-treated cultures after 7 min, whereas thereafter the calcium influx declined to intermediate levels (Fig. 1 A). Thus, these results imply that TGF-β stimulates calcium influx in NIH3T3 cells. As increased calcium entry should lead to elevated total free calcium concentrations ([Ca2+] c) in the cytoplasm of the cells, we measured [Ca2+] c following TGF-β treatment of fura-2-loaded NIH3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 1 B). Consistent with the results of the 45Ca2+influx studies, treatment of the cells with TGF-β for 7 min resulted in a delayed but rapid elevation of [Ca2+] c from 25 nm to approximately 150 nm. This peak value of [Ca2+] c persisted for a period of 3–4 min, whereas significantly increased [Ca2+] c levels could still be detected for prolonged periods (Fig. 1 B). No [Ca2+] c increase could be observed in vehicle-treated cells, even after prolonged incubations at 37 °C (>1.5 h, results not shown). In addition, chelation of the extracellular calcium with EGTA prevented the TGF-β-mediated [Ca2+] c increase (Fig. 1 C), indicating that the presence of external Ca2+ is required for TGF-β action. These data altogether demonstrate that TGF-β mediates a potent and prolonged free Ca2+ increase, at least in part by stimulating calcium entry in NIH3T3 cells, and they support a possible involvement of calcium-dependent events in TGF-β-mediated signaling. Growth factor-triggered activation of calcium-responsive signaling pathways depends on the integrity and content of the intracellular Ca2+ pools, which mainly reside in the ER (reviewed in Ref.31Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). ER calcium content can be irreversibly depleted following treatment of the cells with thapsigargin, a highly specific ER Ca2+ pump inhibitor (32Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Dr⊘bak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2976) Google Scholar, 33Ghosh T.K. Bian J. Short A.D. Rybak S.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24690-24697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether treatment of NIH3T3 cells with this compound might affect TGF-β induction of the CTF-1 TAD. As shown previously (14Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 15Alevizopoulos A. Mermod N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29672-29681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), GAL 399–499, a chimeric protein containing the entire proline-rich transactivation domain of CTF-1 fused to the DNA binding and dimerization domain of the yeast protein GAL4, specifically activated transcription from GAL4 binding sites in NIH3T3 cells, and this basal activity was induced by TGF-β (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, treatment of the cells with low concentrations (15 nm) of thapsigargin inhibited the TGF-β-mediated induction of GAL 399–499 transcriptional activity (Fig.2 A). This effect was specific, as thapsigargin did not significantly alter the transcriptional activities of control GAL4 fusion proteins containing the TADs of other transcription factors such as AP2 and Oct2 (14Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition, thapsigargin did not significantly affect GAL 399–499 and GAL-AP2 expression, as measured by gel shift assays (Fig. 2 B and results not shown). Thus, these data suggest that the induction of the CTF-1 TAD by TGF-β is a specific thapsigargin-sensitive process. Moreover, these data are consistent with the notion that an intact ER calcium pool may be necessary for TGF-β induction of the CTF-1 TAD, further arguing for the involvement of calcium signaling in TGF-β action. Numerous effectors have been shown to mediate calcium signaling in mammalian cells (10Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Of these, the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin may be important for TGF-β signal transduction, as it is regulated by the immunophilin FKBP12, a protein recently shown to interact with the TGF-β type I receptor (9Wang T. Donahoe P.K. Zervos A.S. Science. 1994; 265: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether overexpressed calcineurin might affect GAL 399–499 induction by TGF-β. Interestingly, expression of ΔCNA (a truncated catalytic calcineurin subunit lacking both the autoinhibitory and the calcium/calmodulin-binding domains, Ref. 20O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar) alone or in the presence of its heterodimeric partner CNB (the regulatory calcineurin subunit, Refs. 35Hubbard M. Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1868-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar and 36Milan D. Griffith J. Su M. Price E.R. McKeon F. Cell. 1994; 79: 437-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) resulted in a significant increase of both the basal and the TGF-β-induced GAL 399–499 transcriptional activities (Fig.3 A). In contrast, expression of a mutated ΔCNA (which is unable to heterodimerize with CNB, Ref.21Watanabe Y. Perrino B.A. Chang B.H. Sonderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 456-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or of other phosphatases such as PP2A or PTP1D did not induce the CTF-1 TAD (Fig. 3 A and data not shown). In addition, four distinct GAL4 fusions, containing either the proline-rich TADs of the transcription factors CTF-2 or AP2 or the glutamine-rich TADs of Oct2 or Sp1 all failed to mediate calcineurin activation (Fig. 3 A, right panel, and data not shown). Gel mobility shift assays indicated that calcineurin had no significant effect on the DNA-binding activity and/or the expression levels of GAL 399–499 and GAL-AP2 (Fig.3 B). Thus, calcineurin expression leads to an increase of the transcriptional activity of TGF-β-responsive CTF/NF-I species, such as CTF-1 but not CTF-2, in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. The enzymatic activity of calcineurin can be inhibited by the immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and cyclosporin A (CsA) complexed with their respective cellular receptors, such as the immunophilins FKBP12 and cyclophilin A respectively, but not by a rapamycin·FKBP12 complex (11Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar). We thus tested the effect of these three immunosuppressants on GAL 399–499 activation by ΔCNA and TGF-β (Fig. 3 C). GAL 399–499 still mediated TGF-β induction in the presence of FK506, whereas a slightly reduced TGF-β induction was consistently observed in CsA-treated NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Significantly, treatment of the cells with either FK506 or CsA eliminated the ability of ΔCNA to induce basal GAL 399–499 activity (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, rapamycin had no effect on GAL 399–499 regulation, whereas GAL-AP2 and GAL-Oct2 activities were unaffected by treatment with either immunosuppressant (Fig. 3 C and data not shown). Thus, the enzymatic activity of calcineurin is required for GAL 399–499 induction. Although calcineurin induces the basal transcriptional activity of CTF-1, it has little effect on TGF-β induction per se (Fig. 3), suggesting that calcineurin may not be a direct intermediate of TGF-β action. ΔCNA may act indirectly when overexpressed, however, for example by increasing the activity of a calcium-sensitive component(s) of the TGF-β pathway. We therefore tested whether other known calcium-regulated signaling enzymes, such as specific calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMKs, reviewed in Ref. 34Schulman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), might be involved in the induction of GAL 399–499 transcriptional activity by TGF-β. Suprisingly, expression of a truncated catalytic subunit of CaMKIV, lacking both the autoinhibitory and the calcium/calmodulin-binding domains (ΔCaMKIV), was found to induce basal GAL 399–499 transcriptional activity more than 80-fold in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, and to a lesser extent in Mv1Lu, TA-1, and COS-7 cells (Fig. 4 A, “ΔIV,” and data not shown). In contrast, expression of a catalytically inactive ΔCaMKIV mutant, or of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases I and II (24Nghiem P. Ollick T. Gardner P. Schulman H. Nature. 1994; 371: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,25Picciotto M.R. Czernik A.J. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26512-26521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), failed to induce the CTF-1 TAD. In addition, ΔCaMKIV did not significantly affect GAL-DBD, GAL-AP2, GAL-Sp1, and GAL-Oct2 basal transcriptional activities, whereas it increased only slightly the expression levels of all GAL4 fusion proteins tested (Fig.4 A and data not shown). Thus, ΔCaMKIV specifically induces the activity of the CTF-1 transcriptional activation domain. TGF-β induction of CTF-1 transcriptional activity is mediated by the TGF-β responsive domain (TRD), which resides in the last 20 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of the CTF-1 TAD (14Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To test whether the CTF-1 TRD might be also required for ΔCaMKIV-mediated activation, we examined several previously constructed GAL-CTF1 fusions (14Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) for ΔCaMKIV responsiveness in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4 B). As expected, the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 (GAL-DBD) did not mediate ΔCaMKIV activation in this assay, while the activity of GAL 399–499 was potently induced by ΔCaMKIV. Interestingly, deletion of the CTF-1 TRD abolished kinase induction (Fig. 4 B, GAL 399–486), whereas its direct fusion to GAL-DBD was sufficient to confer full ΔCaMKIV responsiveness (GAL 486–499). A derivative mutated in all phosphorylation acceptor sites in the TRD could still be efficiently induced by ΔCaMKIV (Fig. 4 B, GAL 479–499 3xM), as it is induced by TGF-β (14Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In contrast, the CTF-2 TAD, which naturally lacks a TRD as a result of alternative splicing events (37Mermod N. O'Neill E.A. Kelly T.J. Tijan R. Cell. 1989; 58: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), conferred little, if any, ΔCaMKIV- and TGF-β-mediated induction (Fig.4 B, GAL 399–430, and Ref. 14Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). TGF-β was still able to increase the CaMKIV-activated levels of all TGF-β-responsive GAL-CTF derivatives (for instance GAL 486–499 and GAL 479–499 3xM, Fig.4 B), even though the ability of TGF-β to induce GAL 399–499 activity was reduced in cells overexpressing ΔCaMKIV (from 8.8- to 1.8-fold, Fig. 4 A). Thus, we conclude that the TGF-β-responsive domain mediates the ΔCaMKIV-dependent transcriptional activation of CTF-1. Furthermore, similarly to TGF-β and calcineurin regulation, ΔCaMKIV regulation is confined to specific CTF/NF-I species, such as CTF-1 but not CTF-2. Finally, our results indicate that TRD activation may occur in the absence of ΔCaMKIV-mediated phosphorylation, implying that other ΔCaMKIV-regulated proteins must be involved in this regulatory process. To address the possibility that the endogenous CTF/NF-I polypeptides might be also induced by calcineurin and CaMKIV, we used a reporter promoter containing three high-affinity CTF/NF-I binding sites in front of the α-globin TATA box and thecat gene. As shown previously (15Alevizopoulos A. Mermod N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29672-29681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), this CTF/NF-I-responsive promoter is induced by TGF-β in transiently transfected NIH3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 5 A, pαCAT-Δ87–3xAd). Interestingly, expression of either ΔCNA or ΔCaMKIV significantly induced basal CTF/NF-I transcriptional activity (Fig. 5 A). ΔCNA had no effect on CTF/NF-I induction by TGF-β, whereas TGF-β induction was increased in cells expressing ΔCaMKIV. In contrast, neither enzyme had any effect on the activity of a control promoter lacking CTF/NF-I binding sites or on the activity and TGF-β induction of a distinct TGF-β-responsive promoter (Fig. 5 A, pαCAT-Δ55 and p3TP-Lux). Gel mobility shift analysis of the endogenous CTF/NF-I proteins indicated that ΔCNA and ΔCaMKIV did not significantly affect CTF/NF-I binding activity and/or expression levels (Fig.5 B). Thus, these data indicate that the transcriptional activity of endogenous mouse CTF/NF-I polypeptides is induced by expression of constitutive calcineurin and CaMKIV, which suggests that CTF/NF-I is a relevant transcriptional target for these calcium-regulated enzymes in vivo. However, as for the GAL4 fusion proteins (Fig. 4), ΔCaMKIV did not prevent CTF/NF-I induction by TGF-β, suggesting that CaMKIV is unlikely to be directly involved in this regulatory process. Growth factors regulate gene expression by modulating the activity of target transcription factors through signal transduction cascades. Stimulation of collagen synthesis by mesenchymal cells is an important aspect of TGF-β regulatory action for tissue remodeling, wound healing, and the pathogenesis of some fibrotic disorders (1Alevizopoulos A. Mermod N. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 2Border W.A. Noble N.A. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1000-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A role for CTF/NF-I in collagen synthesis was initially proposed by Rossiet al. (16Rossi P. Karsenty G. Roberts A.B. Roche N.S. Sporn M.B. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 1988; 52: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), who suggested that induction of the human collagen α2(I) promoter by TGF-β might involve CTF/NF-I binding sites (16Rossi P. Karsenty G. Roberts A.B. Roche N.S. Sporn M.B. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 1988; 52: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Indeed, TGF-β was subsequently demonstrated to induce the transcriptional activity of CTF-1, the prototypic member of the CTF/NF-I family (14Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Recently, a possible role for calcium in TGF-action was suggested, as the TGF-β type I receptor was shown to interact with FKBP12, a protein involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis (9Wang T. Donahoe P.K. Zervos A.S. Science. 1994; 265: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated a possible role of free calcium signaling in the induction of CTF-1 transcriptional activity by TGF-β. Our results provide evidence for the potential relevance of calcium signaling in TGF-β action, as we found that (i) TGF-β induces calcium influx in NIH3T3 cells, (ii) it increases free cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca2+] c) to about 150 nm, which is consistent with the requirements for the activation of calcium-dependent signaling enzymes (31Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), (iii) TGF-β is unable to increase [Ca2+] c in EGTA-pretreated cells, and (iv) TGF-β induction of CTF-1 transcriptional activity is prevented by thapsigargin, a compound that inhibits calcium signaling by specifically blocking calcium uptake in the ER (32Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Dr⊘bak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2976) Google Scholar, 33Ghosh T.K. Bian J. Short A.D. Rybak S.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24690-24697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether, these results indicate that TGF-β stimulates calcium influx in NIH3T3 cells, thus leading to an increase in the cytoplasmic calcium concentration that may in turn activate downstream calcium-dependent effectors such as calcineurin and CaMKIV (Fig. 6, pathways 1and 2). Consistent with this possibility, constitutively active variants of CNA and CaMKIV specifically induce the basal transcriptional activity of both the CTF-1 TAD and the endogenous mouse CTF/NF-I proteins in NIH3T3 cells. However, these enzymes are unlikely to be directly involved in the TGF-β induction pathways, as (i) the calcineurin inhibitors FK506 and CsA do not inhibit TGF-β induction of the CTF-1 TAD, (ii) TGF-β still potentiates GAL 399–499 transcriptional activity in ΔCaMKIV and/or ΔCNA co-expressing cells, and (iii) NIH3T3 cells do not express significant levels of the CaMKIV protein, although they do express CNA and CNB mRNAs (as estimated by reverse transcription PCR).2 Our results rather imply that, if calcium signaling is indeed relevant for TGF-β induction of CTF-1, as suggested by the thapsigargin inhibitory effect, it may involve other calcium-regulated intermediates (Fig. 6,pathway 3). In any case, however, calcium signaling alone is unlikely to account for all of the TGF-β actions, as simple administration of calcium ionophores is unable to mimick TGF-β induction of CTF-1. 2A. Alevizopoulos, unpublished data.Therefore, we postulate the existence of yet an additional pathway linking CTF-1 activity to cellular signaling by TGF-β (Fig. 6,pathway 4). ΔCaMKIV action (and also calcineurin-mediated CTF-1 induction, results not shown) specifically targets the previously identified TGF-β-responsive domain of CTF-1 (14Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 15Alevizopoulos A. Mermod N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29672-29681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the catalytic activity of the kinase is required for this effect. This suggests that the kinase phosphorylates either the TRD itself or a TRD-interacting protein. However, phosphorylation-defective TRD variants still confer efficient TGF-β induction, as well as calcineurin- and ΔCaMKIV-mediated activation. Thus, these effects must be mediated by a protein(s) interacting with the TGF-β-responsive domain. One such protein could be histone H3, since it binds the CTF-1 TAD, and it has been proposed to be relevant for TGF-β induction (14Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For instance, CaMKIV or a related kinase might regulate the interaction of the CTF-1 TAD with histone H3, in response to extracellular signaling. Consistent with this possibility, several growth factors and protein kinases have been found to induce histone H3 phosphorylation, and this effect has been correlated with changes in gene expression (38Mahadevan L.C. Willis A.C. Barratt M.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 775-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In summary, the results presented in this study identify CTF-1 as a novel molecular target of calcineurin and CaMKIV action, and they further argue for the potential relevance of calcium signaling in the regulation of extracellular matrix gene expression by TGF-β. Analysis of CTF/NF-I regulation might thus provide insights in the control mechanisms of wound healing and extracellular matrix production by TGF-β and may thus help understand the role of TGF-β in the pathogenesis of fibrotic disorders.

Dermatol. 1993; 12: 210-218PubMed Google Scholar), but the incidence in Northern Sweden has been calculated to be as high as 1 in 12,000 (3Jagell S. Gustavson K.-H. Holmgren G. Clin.

This was shown to be a result of the decreased ability of these cells to oxidize long chain fatty alcohols to the corresponding fatty acids, due to a decrease in long-chain fatty alcohol/NAD+ oxidoreductase (FAO) activity (8Rizzo W.B.

Acta. 1986; 878: 412-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is the aldehyde dehydrogenase (FAldDH) that is deficient in SLS cells (11Rizzo W.B. Craft D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The cDNA for human FAldDH has been isolated and used to demonstrate that patients with SLS have abnormalities within the structural coding sequence (12DeLaurenzi V. Rogers G.R. Hamrock D.J. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. Compton J.G. Marova N. Rizzo W.B. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). These findings are good indicators that this enzymatic deficiency is the primary lesion involved in SLS. Although the biochemical defect has been identified, the relationship between FAldDH deficiency and the symptoms observed in the patients has not been defined. As tools to study SLS, we have isolated mutants in a rodent cell line, CHO-K1, that share the same biochemical lesion as SLS fibroblasts. The animal cells were used since they are immortal, grow rapidly, and a number of experiments can be performed more rapidly than with human fibroblasts. Phenotypic changes found in the CHO mutants can then possibly be extended to the human condition. We have previously reported the isolation of a CHO mutant cell line, FAA.1, that also displayed a deficiency in FAldDH activity (13James P.F. Rizzo W.B. Lee J. Zoeller R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 87: 6102-6106Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the FAA.1 variant was a double mutant, in that it was isolated from a CHO mutant cell line, ZR-82 (14Zoeller R.A. Raetz C.R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5170-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), that was deficient in ether lipid biosynthesis (EL−) and peroxisome function. While FAA.1 is phenotypically similar to SLS fibroblasts with respect to the FAldDH deficiency, the EL− phenotype and loss of functional peroxisomes complicates analyses concerning the relationship between the FAldDH deficiency and changes in cellular functions. For example, EL− cells can accumulate significant amounts of long chain fatty alcohols (13James P.F. Rizzo W.B. Lee J. Zoeller R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 87: 6102-6106Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 15Rizzo W.B. Craft D.A. Judd L.L. Moser H.W. Moser A.B. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1993; 50: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), a phenotype that has also been reported in FAldDH− cells (8Rizzo W.B. Dammann A.L. Craft D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In this study, we used a selection process, similar to that used previously (13James P.F. Rizzo W.B. Lee J. Zoeller R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 87: 6102-6106Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), to isolate an FAldDH− mutant cell line, FAA.K1A, from a wild-type (EL+) background. We report that animal cells defective in FAldDH activity (FAldDH−) were less able to metabolize long chain fatty aldehydes and were hypersensitive to the cytotoxic effects of these compounds. Importantly, this hypersensitivity phenotype could be extended to fibroblasts from an SLS patient. We also present evidence that Schiff's base formations between long chain fatty aldehydes and biologically important amines are enhanced in FAldDH−cells. These findings may help to provide a possible connection between the biochemical defect and the symptoms associated with SLS. [9,10-3H]Hexadecanoic acid (28 Ci/mmol; 1 Ci = 37 Gbq), [methyl-3H]thymidine (248 Gbq/mmol), and EN3HANCE spray were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. [9,10-3H]Hexadecanol was synthesized from [9,10-3H]hexadecanoic acid by the method of Davis and Hajra (16Davis P.A. Hajra A.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 211: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). [1-14C]Hexadecanol (12.5 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Sigma. [1-14C]Hexadecanal was synthesized from [1-14C]hexadecanol, and other aldehydes were synthesized from the corresponding fatty alcohols (purchased from Sigma) by the method of Corey and Suggs (17Corey E.J. Suggs J.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1975; 31: 2647-2650Crossref Scopus (2701) Google Scholar). Once synthesized, aldehydes were quantitated spectrophotometrically after derivatization with ρ-nitrophenylhydrazine (18Ferrell W.J. Radloff J.F. Jackiw A.B. Lipids. 1969; 4: 278-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Decanal, hexanal, and NaCNBH3 were purchased from Aldrich. All other biochemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted in the text.N-Alkyl-phosphatidylethanolamine was synthesized using the method of Borch et al. (19Borch R.F. Bernstein M.D. Durst H.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 2897-2904Crossref Scopus (2086) Google Scholar) using [1-14C]hexadecanal and egg yolk phosphatidylethanolamine. CHO-K1 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Normal human fibroblasts (D.P.) and an unrelated SLS fibroblast (E.C.) cell line were generously donated by Dr. William B. Rizzo, Medical College of Virginia. The E.C. cells have been shown to be FAldDH− by Dr. Rizzo. 2William B. Rizzo, Dept. of Pediatrics and Human Genetics, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, VA, personal communication. All cell lines were maintained in Ham's F12 nutrient mixture (Whittaker Bioscience) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Whittaker Bioscience), 1 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 75 units/ml streptomycin, unless otherwise indicated. This growth medium is referred to as “F12c” throughout the text. Cells were routinely grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. CHO-K1 cells (106) were mutagenized using ethyl methanesulfonate (14Zoeller R.A. Raetz C.R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5170-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and the mutagenized population was allowed to grow for several generations to allow establishment of the phenotypes prior to selection. Mutagenized CHO-K1 cells were plated into several 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks at 2 × 106 cells/flask and incubated in 10 ml of F12c medium overnight at 33 °C. The following day, growth medium containing [9,10-3H]hexadecanol was added to achieve a final concentration of 20 μm hexadecanol at 2 μCi/ml. The cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C; the labeled medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with fresh F12c and then incubated for 1 h in unlabeled F12c at 37 °C. The medium was removed, and the cells were harvested with trypsin, pelleted by centrifugation at 600 × g, and then resuspended in F12c containing 10% (w/v) glycerol. This cell suspension was placed in vials (5 × 105 cells/vial) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Vials were thawed periodically, and viable cells were allowed to grow and form colonies (7–10 days). When less than 100 colonies appeared from a vial (i.e. less than 0.02% survival), the surviving population was harvested and used for the generation of clonal isolates. When fusing CHO strain with another CHO strain, in each fusion pair, one cell line bearing the secondary mutations, resistance to ouabain, and a deficiency in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, was fused with another cell line displaying the wild-type hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase+/ouabain-sensitive phenotypes (20Kennett R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The cell lines were plated together (2 × 105cells of each strain) in one well of a 24-well tissue culture plate and incubated overnight in F12c at 33 °C. The growth medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with sterile PBS and incubated for 1 min in F12 medium (serum-free) containing 50% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (average molecular weight = 3400). The polyethylene glycol-containing medium was removed, and the cells were washed 7 times with PBS and incubated overnight in 1 ml of F12c. The medium was removed, and the cells were harvested with trypsin and plated into 100-mm tissue culture plates in 15 ml of F12c containing hypoxanthine (3 × 10−5m), aminopterin (5 × 10−7m), and thymidine (1.5 × 10−5m) (HAT medium; Ref. 21Littlefield J.W. Science. 1964; 129: 838-839Google Scholar) containing 1 mm ouabain (22Kucherlapati R.S. Baker R.M. Ruddle F.H. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1975; 14: 362-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). After 2 weeks of selection in HAT medium (with medium changes every 3 to 5 days) the surviving hybrids were used for biochemical analyses. When fusing CHO cells with human fibroblasts, CHO cells bearing the secondary mutations were fused to human fibroblasts. Due to the low frequency of successful CHO/human fusions, greater numbers of cells were used. Cells were plated together in 100-mm tissue culture dishes (3 × 106 human/1.5 × 106 CHO) in 10 ml of F12c and incubated at 33 °C overnight. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with sterile PBS and incubated for 3 min with F12, 50% PEG. The PEG-containing medium was removed, and the cells were washed 7 times with 7 ml of PBS. The medium was replaced with 15 ml of HAT selection medium containing 50 μmouabain and 2 μm CdCl2 (HOC medium). Twice during the selection period, the cells were harvested with trypsin, pelleted by centrifugation, and replated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes. This was followed, the next day, with a medium change to remove dead cells. The selection medium was changed every 3 to 5 days, and the surviving cells were evaluated for the ability to convert fatty alcohols to fatty acids after 4 weeks of selection. Cells were grown to near confluence in 100-mm diameter tissue culture dishes in F12c at 37 °C. For each dish, medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and scraped into 3 ml of PBS. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 600 × g for 7 min, washed once with 5 ml of PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 msucrose). The cell suspension was homogenized with 15 up and down strokes of a motorized glass-Teflon homogenizer and frozen at −70 °C. Protein content of each homogenate was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Frozen whole cell homogenates were thawed on ice and sonicated for 30 s using a sonic water bath (Branson Ultrasonics Corporation, Danbury, CT; model 2210) prior to assays. FAO activity was assayed by measuring the NAD+-dependent conversion of [9,10-3H]hexadecanol to the fatty acid essentially as described (13James P.F. Rizzo W.B. Lee J. Zoeller R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 87: 6102-6106Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The reaction mix consisted of 50 mm Bicine, pH 8.5, 0.25 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm NAD+, 5 μm[9,10-3H]hexadecanol (5 × 105 cpm), and 25–50 μg of cellular protein in a final volume of 200 μl. Samples containing the complete reaction mix, except the cell homogenate (replaced with the appropriate volume of homogenization buffer), were used as blanks. The reactions were initiated by the addition of NAD+ following a 5-min preincubation at 37 °C. After 20 min at 37 °C, in a shaking water bath, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 2 ml of 2% acetic acid in methanol. Following the addition of 100 μg of carrier lipid (total lipid from mouse liver), 2 ml of chloroform, and 1.5 ml of PBS were added to form a two-phase system (24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar). After vortexing, the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 600 × g to separate the phases, and the lower (organic) phase was recovered. The upper phase was washed once with 2 ml of chloroform, and the two lower phases were combined. Lipids were separated by TLC on silica gel 60 (Merck) using hexane:ethyl ether:acetic acid (70:30:1) as the solvent system. After drying, the thin layer plates were sprayed with EN3HANCE and exposed to Kodak X-AR film at −70 °C. Fatty alcohol, fatty acid, and fatty aldehyde were located using the x-ray film pattern and identified based on co-migration with authentic standards. The bands of interest were scraped into scintillation vials containing 1 ml of methanol and were counted using liquid scintillation spectrometry after adding 8 ml of Ecoscint A (Ecoscint A; National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA). FAldDH activity was determined identically to FAO activity with the exception that 75 μm [1-14C]hexadecanal was used as substrate. All assays were performed under conditions in which the rate of fatty acid formation was linear. To measure fatty alcohol conversion, cells were plated into sterile glass scintillation vials, at cell densities that would yield 10–60 μg of total cell protein, in 1 ml of F12c and allowed to attach overnight at 37 °C. Medium was removed, replaced with 0.8 ml of medium containing 5 μm[9,10-3H]hexadecanol (3.8 × 106cpm/vial), and cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Following this, 3 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1), 300 μg of carrier lipid (total lipid extract from bovine heart), and 50 μl of concentrated HCl were added to form a single-phase Bligh and Dyer system (24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar). This single phase mixture was transferred to a test tube, and a two-phase system was formed by the addition 1 ml of chloroform and 1 ml of PBS followed by vortexing. After separation of the phases by centrifugation, the lower (organic) phase was recovered. The upper phase was washed once with 2 ml of chloroform, and the lower phases were combined. The lipid extracts were taken to dryness under a stream of nitrogen, resuspended in 0.5 ml of 0.5 n NaOH, and incubated at 80 °C for 1 h to hydrolyze esterified fatty acids. The samples were cooled, acidified with the addition of 1 ml of 1n HCl, and extracted twice with 3 ml ofn-hexane. Labeled fatty acids were isolated on thin layer chromatography and quantitated as described above for FAO activity assays. Vials containing no cells were incubated under identical conditions and analyzed as controls. Duplicate, unlabeled vials were used for protein determination, using the method of Lowry et al. (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays of fatty aldehyde conversion to fatty acid were performed in a similar fashion. Cells were exposed to 75 μm[1-14C]hexadecanal (106 cpm) for 20 min, at 37 °C, prior to extraction of both the medium and cellular lipids. Cells were plated into sterile glass scintillation vials (105 cells/vial) and allowed to attach overnight at 37 °C. The next day, medium was removed and replaced with 1 ml of F12c containing 2 μm[9,10-3H]hexadecanol (5 × 105 cpm/ml). The cells were incubated at 37 °C after which the medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with 0.4 ml of PBS, and the medium and wash were combined in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. The medium was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 min to pellet out any residual cells, and 0.8 ml of the supernatant was used for lipid extraction (24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar) as described above, under neutral conditions (no HCl added). After evaporation of the solvent, fatty aldehyde was isolated on silica gel 60 using a triple development system (25Downing D.T. J. Chromatogr. 1968; 38: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This involved successive developments of the TLC plate in benzene, hexane, and hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (70:30:1) with drying between runs. The thin layer plates were sprayed then with EN3HANCE and exposed to Kodak X-AR film at −70 °C. Radioactive fatty aldehyde was identified based on co-migration with authentic standard. The aldehyde band was scraped into a scintillation vial containing 1 ml of methanol and was counted using liquid scintillation spectrometry after adding 8 ml of scintillation fluid. Cellular protein was determined using parallel, unlabeled vials. Vials containing no cells were used as experimental blanks. Cytotoxicity was determined either using a visual, clonigenic assay or by measuring the incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine into DNA (26Mosley S.T. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Falck J.R. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5717-5721Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) following aldehyde treatment. For experiments using the clonigenic assay, cells were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates at 4 × 103 cells/ml in 0.4 ml of growth medium, F12c, and allowed to attach overnight at 37 °C. The following day, medium was removed and replaced with 0.4 ml of F12c containing the test compound at the indicated concentration, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C. After 8 h, a 0.2-ml bolus of F12c containing the same concentration of test compound was added to the well, and the cells were incubated for an additional 20 h at 37 °C. The aldehyde-containing F12c medium was removed and replaced with 1 ml of F12c containing no additions, and the cells were incubated for an additional 5–7 days at 37 °C to allow the surviving cells to grow. The colonies resulting from the surviving cells were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. For staining, the medium was removed, the cells were washed once with 2 ml of PBS, and 0.5 ml of 0.5% (w/v) Coomassie Blue in methanol:H2O:acetic acid (45:45:10) was added for 30 min. This was removed, and the cells were washed twice with 2 ml in methanol:H2O:acetic acid (45:45:10) to remove residual stain. For [methyl-3H]thymidine labeling, cells were labeled after 3 days of growth following aldehyde treatment. Medium was removed and replaced with 0.4 ml of F12c containing [methyl-3H]thymidine at 2.0 μCi/ml, and the cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The labeling medium was then removed, and 0.5 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid was added. The cell monolayers were washed 5 times with 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid (ice-cold) and twice with 1.5 ml of ice-cold ethyl ether:ethanol (1:3). After drying, DNA was solubilized by adding 0.3 ml of 0.5 n NaOH and incubating for 2 h at 37 °C. Aliquots were counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry after neutralization with HCl. Aldehydes were added to the medium and sonicated for 5 min in a sonicating bath immediately prior to addition to the cells in all cases. Cells (105) were plated, in 1 ml of F12c, into sterile glass scintillation vials and allowed to attach overnight at 33 °C. The following day, 0.5 ml of F12c containing 1.5 μCi of [1-3H]ethanolamine was added, and the cells were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C. The labeled medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with 3 ml of F12c. The cells were worked up immediately, or, alternatively, 1 ml of F12c containing the indicated addition (usually fatty aldehyde) was added to the labeled cells, which were then incubated for an additional 3 h at 37 °C prior to workup. To work up the samples, medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with PBS. One-half of the vials for any given treatment was treated with PBS containing 25 mm NaCNBH3 for 2 h at 37 °C (27Jentoft N. Dearborn D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4359-4365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other half of the samples was treated with PBS alone (no NaCNBH3). Following this, the cells could be easily detached from the glass surface with gentle agitation, after which the cell suspension was transferred to a 15-ml conical centrifuge tube. Residual cells were recovered with 3 ml of PBS, and this wash was added to the original cell suspension. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 7 min at 600 × g. The supernatant was removed, and the cells were washed 3 times using 10 ml of PBS, and the final cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. For each sample, 0.1 ml of the cell suspension was used for protein determination, and 0.8 ml was added to a glass tube containing 2 ml of methanol, 1 ml of chloroform, and 300 μg of carrier lipid (total mouse liver lipid) to form a single phase solution (24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with NaCNBH3 resulted in the same recovery of cellular protein when compared with cells that had been treated with PBS alone. The lipids were extracted as described above for the FAO assays, under neutral conditions. Organic solvent was removed, and the lipids were resuspended in chloroform and separated on silica gel 60 (Merck) using chloroform:methanol (90:10; v:v). The TLC plates were exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C following treatment with EN3HANCE spray. Bands of interest were scraped into scintillation vials and quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Our intent was to isolate cells that were unable to convert long chain fatty alcohols (e.g. hexadecanol) to the corresponding fatty acid due to a loss of long-chain fatty alcohol oxidase (FAO) activity. Tritium suicide was used as the selection method. Cells that have accumulated a tritiated compound will be damaged by the radioactive decay of the tritium while frozen in liquid nitrogen. If the damage is extensive enough, the cells will not survive when thawed. The severity of the damage is dependent on the amount of tritium accumulated and the amount of time frozen. Cells that have accumulated less tritium will survive longer freezing periods. The majority of [9,10-3H]hexadecanol taken up by a cell is incorporated, as the alcohol, into ether lipids or is converted to the corresponding fatty acid and incorporated into complex lipids (28Rizzo W.B. Craft D.A. Dammann A.L. Phillips M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17412-17419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant cells that cannot form ether lipids (EL−) or that cannot convert [9,10-3H]hexadecanol to hexadecanoic acid (FAO−) incorporate less tritium than wild-type cells (13James P.F. Rizzo W.B. Lee J. Zoeller R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 87: 6102-6106Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and survive longer freezing times after incubation with [9,10-3H]hexadecanol. A mutagenized population of CHO-K1 cells were allowed to take up [9,10-3H]hexadecanol over a period of 3 h. This was followed by a 1-h incubation in growth medium that contained no hexadecanol, to allow any uncomplexed fatty alcohol to diffuse out of the cells. Under these conditions, the cells accumulated an average of 0.75 dpm/cell. The labeled cells were then frozen in cryogenic medium in a series of vials. At 1 week intervals, a vial was thawed, and the surviving cells were allowed to grow out and form colonies. After 14 weeks of frozen storage, only 25–50 colonies were generated from a vial of approximately 5 × 105 labeled cells. This surviving population was harvested, and eight cell lines were clonally purified using limiting dilution. O"
https://openalex.org/W1966116208,"CD100 is a 150-kDa homodimeric glycoprotein broadly expressed on the surface of human hematopoietic cells. CD100 has been recently identified as the first lymphoid gene that belongs to the semaphorin gene family. Semaphorins function as chemorepellent molecules in the nervous system, but the function of CD100 remains poorly understood. In lymphoid cells, it has been suggested to play a role in homotypic cell adhesion and in T cell activation. We demonstrate that in T cells and natural killer cells a serine kinase activity is immunoprecipitated with CD100. Distinct epitopes of CD100 have been defined with specific monoclonal antibodies, mediating opposite effects at the functional level, especially in T cells. The kinase activity is retained only with an antibody against a particular epitope of CD100. Additionally, a fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic domain of the molecule retains the kinase activity in cellular lysates, and CD100 itself is presumably a favorite substrate of the kinase. These findings suggest that a serine kinase pathway may participate in the different functional effects triggered through the distinct epitopes of CD100 and is likely involved in the biological effects of this semaphorin-like leukocyte cell surface molecule.

The recent cloning of CD100 has permitted the classification of the molecule into the semaphorin family, since it contains in its extracellular region a semaphorin-like domain (4Hall K.T. Boumsell L. Schultze J.L. Boussiotis V.A. Dorfman D.M. Cardoso A.A. Bensussan A. Nadler L.M. Freeman G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

CD100 is the first known receptor in hematopoietic cells that belongs to this large and phylogenetically conserved family of cell surface and secreted proteins. Semaphorins have mainly been described in the nervous system as mediators of repulsive growth cone guidance and are critical for the organization of the nervous system (6Keynes R. Cook G.M.W. Cell. 1995; 83: 161-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 7Kolodkin A.L.

The semaphorins are structurally defined by a conserved 500-amino acid extracellular domain with 16 conserved cysteines, the so-called sema domain, often followed by an Ig-like domain, as is found in the CD100 molecule. CD100 also contains an additional 104-residue stretch C-terminal to the Ig domain, a transmembrane domain, and a 110-residue cytoplasmic domain with no significant homology with the intracellular part of other semaphorins (4Hall K.T. Boumsell L. Schultze J.L. Boussiotis V.A. Dorfman D.M. Cardoso A.A. Bensussan A. Nadler L.M. Freeman G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the use of specific mAbs as ligands has permitted the classification of CD100 into the family of T cell activation molecules (2Bougeret C. Mansurl G. Dastot H. Schmid M. Mahouy G. Bensussan A. Boumsell L. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 318-323PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hérold C. Bismuth G. Bensussan A. Boumsell L. Int.

We previously reported that mAbs BB18 and BD16 had distinct effects depending on the activating system used to trigger T cell activation, but both clearly had an agonistic effect. T cell stimulation through various cell surface activation molecules frequently involves a partnership with enzymatical activities, especially kinases and phosphatases, that are proximal elements able to trigger complex intracellular biochemical cascades (12Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar, 13Wange R.L. Samelson L.E.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Investigating the status of CD100 associations in human T cells, we recently discovered that CD100 was linked to the phosphatase CD45 (15Herold C. Elhabazi A. Bismuth G. Bensussan A. Boumsell L. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5262-5268PubMed Google Scholar), a key membrane molecule in the T cell receptor activation process (16Frearson J.A. Alexander D.R. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 385-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the present report, to further document the signaling pathway associated with CD100, we determined whether a protein kinase might also be associated with this semaphorin-like leukocyte cell surface structure. We find that a cellular kinase activity can physically associate with the cytoplasmic domain of CD100. We show that CD100 itself is presumably a favorite substrate of this kinase, and we also provide arguments that a differential participation of the kinase may account for the distinct functional effects triggered by the different epitopes of CD100. The human leukemic T cell line Jurkat and the human CD25-negative NK line YT2C2 were propagated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1% sodium-pyruvate, and antibiotics. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from healthy volunteer donors by Ficoll centrifugation. To obtain activated T cells, PBMC were cultured for 4 days in the same medium as above supplemented with 1 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA; Difco). CD100-specific mAbs BD16 (IgG1) and BB18 (IgG1) were obtained as described previously (1Boumsell L. Schmid M. Dastot H. Gouttefangeas C. Mathieu-Mahul D. Bensussan A. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2797-2802PubMed Google Scholar, 17David V. Bachelez H. Leca G. Degos L. Boumsell L. Bensussan A. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 1-6PubMed Google Scholar). They were produced as ascitic fluid and purified by affinity chromatography on a protein A- or G-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) as reported (1Boumsell L. Schmid M. Dastot H. Gouttefangeas C. Mathieu-Mahul D. Bensussan A. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2797-2802PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bougeret C. Mansurl G. Dastot H. Schmid M. Mahouy G. Bensussan A. Boumsell L. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 318-323PubMed Google Scholar). The other mAb used in this work, also produced in the laboratory, was against CD2 (mAb O275; IgG1). Immunoprecipitation of biotinylated cell surface proteins was performed as described elsewhere (18Cole S.R. Ashman L.K. Ey P.L. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were labeled in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mg of Immunopure sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Pierce) for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by adding RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 10 min followed by a rapid centrifugation. Cells were then lysed in buffer containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 or Brij-58 1% (w/v) detergent, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 units/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm leupeptin for 30 min at 4 °C. After a centrifugation at 12,000 × g to remove cellular debris, the lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B before immunoprecipitation with 10 μg of the appropriate mAb and protein A-Sepharose. Immune complexes were eluted from the beads by boiling the samples in a Laemmli sample buffer for 3 min. Solubilized proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were probed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) on x-ray film (DuPont). cDNA encoding the intracellular domain of human CD100 (amino acids 754–863, Fig.1 and Ref. 4Hall K.T. Boumsell L. Schultze J.L. Boussiotis V.A. Dorfman D.M. Cardoso A.A. Bensussan A. Nadler L.M. Freeman G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11780-11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) was amplified using polymerase chain reaction. The 5′ primer consisted of aBamHI restriction site followed by the sequence GTGGGATCCAACTGCTATAAGGGATAC. The 3′ primer consisted of the sequence GGGGAATTCTCAGTCTCCATCTGCGTC followed by an EcoRI restriction site. The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-2T at theBamHI-EcoRI sites and expressed as a GST fusion protein. The recombinant plasmid was used to transformEscherichia coli protease-deficient strain BL21. Cultures were grown at 37 °C and induced with 100 μmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 1 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation. The pellet was washed once in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS and resuspended in the same buffer. Cells were lysed using sonication, and lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C then stored at −80 °C. Fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose beads (Pharmacia). GST-CD100i soluble fusion protein was recovered by heating the beads 10 min at 90 °C in the presence of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% SDS followed by extensive dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline. For fusion protein binding assays, Nonidet P-40 cell lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the fusion protein coupled to glutathione beads. Immune or fusion protein complexes, prepared as described above, were washed three times with cold lysis buffer and once with a phosphorylation buffer containing 50 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 10 mmMnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm sodium orthovanadate, 50 units/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 2 min of equilibration at 30 °C, the reaction was started by the addition on the beads of 30 μl of phosphorylation buffer supplemented with 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (>4000 Ci/mmole, ICN Biomedicals France, Orsay, France). When indicated, 1 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma) was added as an exogeneous substrate. In some experiments we used a recombinant wild-type form of the Src tyrosine kinase p56lck produced in SF9 insect cells (0.5 μl of a crude cell lysate) and kindly provided by Dr. S. Fisher (INSERM U 363, Institut Cochin de Génétique Moléculaire, Paris, France). After 5 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 40 μl of SDS sample buffer and boiling. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography on x-ray film. In some experiments, before drying and autoradiography, the gel was treated with KOH 1 m at 55 °C for 2 h. Assays were performed with inhibitors of protein kinases (see “Results”) obtained from Calbiochem (France Biochem, Meudon, France) to determine their effect on the cellular kinase activity retained by the GST-CD100i fusion protein. Quantitation of radioactivity was achieved by transferring the dried gel to a high resolution β-imager (Biospace, Paris, France), allowing us to obtain a digital autoradiogram and quantitate signals by direct measurement of numeric images obtained from actual counting of β-particles emitted. For phosphoamino acid analysis, phosphoproteins were revealed by autoradiography of the undried gel then excised and digested with 5.9m HCl for 1 h at 110 °C. The digested material was then dried in a speedvac apparatus, and the pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of a buffer containing 2.2% formic acid and 1.38 mm acetic acid, pH 1.9. Samples were analyzed by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography on nitrocellulose-coated plates (Merck, Darmstad, Germany) using the pH 1.9 buffer for the first dimension (900 V for 90 min) and a buffer containing 5% acetic acid and 0.5% pyridine, pH 3.5, for the second dimension (900 V for 45 min). Standard phosphoamino acids (phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine, and phosphothreonine; Sigma) were run in parallel and visualized by spraying the plates with a 1% ninhydrin solution and heating at 80 °C before autoradiography. The T cell stimulating properties of two CD100 mAbs, BB18 and BD16, which recognize different epitopes of CD100, have been previously reported (2Bougeret C. Mansurl G. Dastot H. Schmid M. Mahouy G. Bensussan A. Boumsell L. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 318-323PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hérold C. Bismuth G. Bensussan A. Boumsell L. Int.

Ritz J. Shaw S. Silverstein R. Springer T. Tedder T.F. Todd R.F. Leucocyte Typing V. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 290-292Google Scholar). Since protein kinases are frequently essential elements of receptor-triggered signaling events leading to T cell activation, we performed in vitro kinase assay experiments using CD100 immunoprecipitates obtained from Jurkat T cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 2, panel A, different phosphoproteins can be observed in the BB18 immunoprecipitate. They include two bands migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 150 and 120 kDa (see also panel B) and additional phosphorylated proteins in the 80-, 55–60-, and 33-kDa regions of the gel. The results were not different with Jurkat cells previously activated with anti-CD3 (not shown). The phosphoprotein patterns obtained with the CD2-specific mAb 0275 used as a positive control of kinase-associated receptor (19Schraven B. Wild M. Kirshgessner H. Siebert B. Wallich R. Henning S. Samstag Y. Meuer S.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and with an IgG1 irrelevant mAb (referred to as control in Fig. 2 and in all subsequent experiments) are also shown. The kinase activity was indifferent to the lysis conditions, since the same pattern could be obtained when using Nonidet P-40 instead of Brij-58-based lysates (Fig. 2 B). Intriguingly, as shown in Fig. 2, A and B, we found that the CD100-specific BD16 mAb failed to precipitate a detectable amount of phosphoproteins. To further investigate this point, we used Jurkat cell lysates previously labeled with biotin to perform CD100 immunoprecipitations followed by parallel Western blot analysis andin vitro kinase assays. As shown in Fig.3 A, BD16 (lane 2) and BB18 (lane 3) mAbs immunoprecipitated almost equal amounts of biotinylated CD100. However, in the in vitrokinase assay shown in Fig. 3 B, only BB18 (lane 3) retained the kinase activity as compared with BD16 (lane 2) or a control antibody (lane 1). We also show in the same experiment that immunodepletion with BD16 totally removes the kinase activity immunoprecipitated with BB18 (lane 4), excluding that BB18 and BD16 recognize distinct populations of CD100. Preliminary experiments showed that the kinase activity was likely of the serine kinase nature (see Fig. 5 below). Thus, in vitro kinase assay experiments were also conducted using myelin basic protein, an exogeneous serine kinase substrate. As shown in Fig. 3, lower panel, using increasing amounts of Jurkat cell lysate, BB18, strongly retained the kinase activity. Only a faint phosphorylation of myelin basic protein was seen with BD16 immunoprecipitates.Figure 5CD100 is phosphorylated on serine residues.

Dastot H. Bensussan A. Boumsell L. Schlossman S.F. Boumsell L. Gilks W. Harlan J.M. Kishimoto T. Morimoto C. Ritz J. Shaw S. Silverstein R. Springer T. Tedder T.F. Todd R.F. Leucocyte Typing V. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 288-289Google Scholar). However, after labeling with biotin, we frequently observed an additional protein migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 120 kDa in CD100 immunoprecipitates. This is shown in Fig. 4 A, where we analyzed Jurkat T cells, the CD100 highly positive YT2C2 NK cell line, unstimulated PBMC, and PHA blasts. An additional biotinylated 120-kDa band is clearly observable in the BB18 immunoprecipitates from YT2C2 cells and PHA-activated T cells. This band was always less evident in Jurkat cells and especially in freshly isolated PBMC. In vitro kinase assays were performed in parallel with the same cell lysates. Fig. 4 B shows the results obtained with mAb BD16 and BB18. With BB18, two phosphorylated bands with the same molecular mass as the biotinylated proteins observed in Fig. 4 A could be detected in YT2C2 cells and PHA blasts. In Jurkat cells, together with the major phosphoprotein of 150 kDa, the additional band around 120 kDa was weakly labeled, confirming the results obtained in Fig. 2. No bands were detected with unstimulated PBMC in this experiment, but we observed a faint labeling of the 150-kDa band with some donors (not shown). Several conclusions can be drawn from these results. They first demonstrate that the kinase activity is associated with CD100 in the different cell types, including normal T cells. They also strongly suggest that in BB18 immunoprecipitates, the 150-kDa phosphoprotein is CD100, and the 120-kDa band is an additional form of CD100 or a CD100-associated membrane protein highly expressed in YT2C2 and activated PBMC (see “Discussion”). Finally, they confirm that BD16 immunoprecipitates do not retain the kinase activity whatever the cell type. We further investigated whether the 150- and 120-kDa phosphoproteins were phosphorylated on tyrosine or on serine/threonine residues. YT2C2 cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with mAb BB18, an in vitrokinase assay was performed, and the phosphorylated protein was separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig.5 A). The 150- and 120-kDa phosphoproteins were then subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig.5 B). The majority of the radioactive phosphate was on serine residues in both phosphoproteins. The 150-kDa band was slightly labeled on threonine residues. No phosphotyrosine could be detected. Human CD100 has been recently cloned (4Hall K.T. Boumsell L. Schultze J.L. Boussiotis V.A. Dorfman D.M. Cardoso A.A. Bensussan A. Nadler L.M. Freeman G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11780-11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and we constructed a GST fusion protein of its intracellular domain (GST-CD100i) to investigate if it could retain a kinase activity. As shown in Fig.6 B, after Coomassie Blue staining, the fusion protein migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa. Various amounts of glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST or GST-CD100i fusion proteins were incubated with a Jurkat cell lysate then washed and subjected to in vitro phosphorylation, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig.6 A, a kinase activity can be retained by the polypeptide corresponding to the intracellular domain of CD100, as evidenced by the high phosphorylation of the 40-kDa CD100 fusion protein itself, a phosphorylation that can be removed by KOH treatment (not shown, see Fig. 8 below). No phosphorylated bands were observed with the control GST immunoprecipitates. In these samples, 1 μg of soluble GST-CD100i was added during the kinase assay as an internal control substrate to exclude a nonspecifically retained kinase activity.Figure 8Src kinase p56lck does not phosphorylate GST-CD100i in vitro. Left panelGST (lane 1) or GST-CD100i (lane 2) recombinant fusion proteins (3 μg) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were subjected to in vitro kinase assay in the presence of a recombinant form of p56lck. Precipitates from Nonidet P-40 Jurkat cell lysates (5 × 106 cells) with GST (lane 3) or GST-CD100i (lane 4) immobilized on Sepharose beads were subjected to in vitro kinase assays as in Fig. 6 and run in parallel.

None of the tested inhibitors abolished CD100i phosphorylation. As shown in Fig.7, bisindolylmaleimide I, a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C (and also of protein kinase A at the tested concentration) (20Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the Ca2+/calmodulin kinase inhibitor KN-93 (21Sumi M. Kiuchi K. Ishikawa T. Ishii A. Hagiwara M. Nagatsu T. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), were ineffective. Only a moderate effect was obtained with KT5926 and KT5823. At 10 μm, KT5926 had a large spectrum of inhibition on protein kinase A, protein kinase G, protein kinase C, myosin light chain kinase, and Ca2+/calmodulin kinase (22Nakanishi S. Yamada K. Iwahashi K. Kudora K. Kase H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 482-488PubMed Google Scholar). KT-5823 was more specific for protein kinase G (23Kase H. Iwahashi K. Nakanishi S. Matsuda Y. Yamada K. Takahashi M. Murakata C. Sato A. Kaneko M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). The most significant inhibition was obtained with H89, which inhibits most cellular serine/threonine kinases (24Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A very high level of consensus serine phosphorylation sites are present in the intracellular domain of CD100 (Fig. 1). But a typical phosphorylation site by Src tyrosine kinases (KPALDTGY) is also present (25Patschinsky T. Hunter T. Esch F.S. Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). GST and GST-CD100i proteins were therefore exposed to in vitro phosphorylation by the Src tyrosine kinase p56lck. Glutathione-Sepharose-bound fusion proteins, previously incubated with Jurkat cell lysate as in the previous experiment, were used in parallel as a control of CD100i phosphorylation (Fig. 8). No significant phosphorylation of the CD100i fusion protein by p56lck was observed, in contrast to the KOH-sensitive phosphorylation after incubation with the Jurkat cell lysate (compare the left and the right panel). A broad range of serine/threonine kinases have been identified in lymphoid cells. But only a few of these activities have been found to be directly associated with cell membrane receptors. In B cells, for instance, an association of immunoglobulin with a casein-kinase-like serine/threonine kinase has been reported (26Williams G.T. Peaker C.J,. Patel K.J. Neuberger M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates of the B cell-specific membrane proteins CD19 and CD20 also contain a serine kinase activity (27van Noesel C.J. Lankester A.C. van Schijndel G.M. van Lier R.A. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 28Deans J.P. Schieven G.L. Shu G.L. Valentine M.A. Gilliland L.A. Aruffo A. Clark E.A. Ledbetter J.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4494-4504PubMed Google Scholar). In T cells it is noteworthy to mention the case of Raf-1, a serine/threonine kinase associated with the CD3 δ and γ chains and with the CD4-p56lck complex (29Loh C. Romeo C. Seed B. Bruder J.T. Rapp U. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8817-8825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Prasad K.V. Rudd C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5260-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and of a serine kinase activity associated with CD5 in T cells (31Alberola-Ila J. Places L. Loranzo F. Vives J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4423-4430PubMed Google Scholar). We report in the present study the immediate association of the CD100 activation molecule with a serine kinase activity, a finding that may be an essential step in the elucidation of downstream signals mediated by the engagement of this new class of hematopoietic receptors. We initially suspected that the enzymatic activity found in CD100 immunoprecipitates would be endowed by the CD100 molecule itself. Our very recent knowledge of the CD100 amino acid sequence reveals none of the particular consensus sequences found in protein kinases; thus, this possibility can now be excluded. Nevertheless, our experiments with the GST-CD100i recombinant protein suggest a close and maybe constitutive interaction between the intracellular domain of the molecule and a cellular serine kinase. They also show that the cytoplasmic tail of CD100 is a very good substrate for the associated kinase, in good agreement with its sequence, which contains numerous potential serine/threonine phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1). We can thus speculate that in vivo one major target of the kinase detected in BB18 immunoprecipitates is the intracellular domain of CD100. Consistent with this, we have been able to precipitate CD100 as a 150-kDa phosphoprotein in some human T cell clones labeled in vivowith 32P. However, this was not consistently reproduced using transformed cell lines (not shown). In vitrophosphorylation of CD100 always appeared undetectable or very low in resting T cells compared with PHA-activated cells. This suggests either a link between the state of activation of the cell and CD100 association with the kinase or an increase in the kinase activity after cell stimulation. This point is under investigation. If true, it would be reminiscent of what has been shown after T cell antigen receptor or CD5 activation for the serine kinase activity associated with CD5 (31Alberola-Ila J. Places L. Loranzo F. Vives J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4423-4430PubMed Google Scholar). However, the level of CD100 expression by T cells, which is increased by activation (2Bougeret C. Mansurl G. Dastot H. Schmid M. Mahouy G. Bensussan A. Boumsell L. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 318-323PubMed Google Scholar), may also be partly responsible. Besides CD100, a 120-kDa protein was usually found in CD100 immunoprecipitates and was phosphorylated in in vitro kinase assays (Figs. 2 and 4). Preliminary data suggest that it may arise from cleavage in the extracellular domain of one chain of a CD100 150-kDa homodimer, resulting in a truncated form of CD100 associated with the integral CD100 membrane protein. Multiepitopic characterization of cell surface antigens using different specific mAbs is often a fruitful approach, particularly when one can distinguish these mAbs by their capacities to induce different functional effects. This is the case with mAbs BD16 and BB18, which differentially influence CD3- or CD2-induced proliferation of PBMC and purified T cells (9Hérold C. Bismuth G. Bensussan A. Boumsell L. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Hérold C. Dastot H. Bismuth G. Bensussan A. Boumsell L. Schlossman S.F. Boumsell L. Gilks W. Harlan J.M. Kishimoto T. Morimoto C. Ritz J. Shaw S. Silverstein R. Springer T. Tedder T.F. Todd R.F. Leucocyte Typing V. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 290-292Google Scholar). We report here the different behavior of these two CD100 mAbs at a biochemical level, although they clearly have similar binding capacities as attested by immunoprecipitation experiments. One puzzling observation in the present work concerned the effect of BD16 epitope ligation on the CD100-associated kinase activity, since we were unable to measure a significant kinase activity in BD16 immunoprecipitates. The most likely hypothesis is that perturbation of the BD16 epitope induces a direct conformational change of the molecule thereby altering its association with the intracellular kinase. In our recent and parallel work in human T cells, a physical link between CD100 and the phosphatase CD45 was observed (15Herold C. Elhabazi A. Bismuth G. Bensussan A. Boumsell L. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5262-5268PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that before the discovery of CD100, the association of CD45 with an unknown 150-kDa protein was already reported in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (32Schraven B. Samstag Y. Altevogt P. Meuer S.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Such a finding suggested a functional association between the two molecules at the cell surface. Stover and Walsh (33Stover D.R. Walsh K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5523-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) recently showed that the protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity of CD45 in vitro was enhanced after sequential phosphorylations on tyrosine and serine residues (33Stover D.R. Walsh K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5523-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Regulation of CD45 by the CD100-associated serine kinase is thus quite possible. Moreover, we previously published that mAb to CD100 and CD45 gave similar effects on CD2-triggered PBMC proliferation (3Hérold C. Dastot H. Bensussan A. Boumsell L. Schlossman S.F. Boumsell L. Gilks W. Harlan J.M. Kishimoto T. Morimoto C. Ritz J. Shaw S. Silverstein R. Springer T. Tedder T.F. Todd R.F. Leucocyte Typing V. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 288-289Google Scholar). Altogether, these findings suggest a close relationship between the two molecules, an important result since CD45 plays a key role in regulating the T cell activation process through receptor-associated tyrosine kinases (34Burns C.M.

Signaling molecules with either attractive or repulsive effects might be involved in guiding lymphoid cells to their appropriate destinations. In the nervous system, proteins of the semaphorin family contribute to this phenomenon, since they appear to control axonal pathfinding during neural development by inhibiting growth cone extension and reorientation (6Keynes R. Cook G.M.W. Cell. 1995; 83: 161-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 7Kolodkin A.L.

The finding that CD100 is homologous to the semaphorin gene family, which includes both transmembrane and secreted proteins (39Kolodkin A.L. Mathes D.J. Goodman C.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1389-1399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), is therefore of the highest interest. Furuyama et al. (5Furuyama T. Inagaki S. Kosugi A. Noda S. Saitoh S.

The sema domain has 88% amino acid identity to human CD100 and the cytoplasmic domain has 94% identity, implying a highly conserved signaling function. Inagaki et al. (40Inagaki S. Furuyama T. Iwahashi Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) also identified an additional transmembrane semaphorin in mouse brain that contains in its extracellular region a semaphorin-like domain followed by a single Ig-like domain. Interestingly, the intracellular domain of this molecule, although very different from the corresponding part of CD100, also has several consensus serine/threonine phosphorylation sites. Therefore, despite the fact that the mechanism of semaphorin action in growth cone collapse is poorly understood, an intracellular signaling cascade is likely involved (40Inagaki S. Furuyama T. Iwahashi Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 41Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Whether phosphorylation events are implicated in this process is unknown and does not permit generalizations about signaling by transmembrane semaphorins. Nevertheless, our present results reveal that a serine kinase pathway is likely associated with the CD100 semaphorin. This may help to understand whether CD100 is also a positive and/or a negative guidance membrane receptor for lymphoid cells."

Acetylcholine receptors from vertebrate skeletal muscle are pentamers of homologous subunits with compositions α2βγδ in fetal or α2βεδ in adult muscle (1Mishina M. Takai T. Imoto K. Noda M. Takahashi T. Numa S. Methfessel C. Sakmann B. Nature. 1986; 321: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). The functional receptor contains two acetylcholine binding sites, each generated by pairs of subunits, αδ and either αγ or αε (2Blount P. Merlie J.P.

Our current picture of the binding site is a subunit interface comprising three loops from the α subunit and four loops from the non-α subunit (reviewed in Ref. 5Prince R.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25770-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although binding of small agonists and antagonists is mutually exclusive, their wide range in affinities for a given binding site likely owes to stabilization by different loops, whereas selectivity of a ligand for the three types of sites owes to differences in residues of a particular loop. Residues that stabilize small agonists and antagonists have been identified in both the α and non-α subunits, yet residues that stabilize the much larger peptide antagonist α-bungarotoxin (α-btx) 1The abbreviations used are: α-btx, α-bungarotoxin; DMT, dimethyl-d-tubocurarine; CTX, α-conotoxin M1; MTSEA, aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate; MTSET, trimethylammonium-ethyl methanethiosulfonate; MTSES, sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate. have been identified only in the α subunit (6Neumann D.

Photolabeling studies using either α-btx or an α-neurotoxin derivative demonstrated labeling of the γ and δ subunits of theTorpedo receptor, suggesting proximity of these subunits to the site of α-btx binding (8Oswald R.E.

To identify portions of the non-α subunits close to the α-btx binding site, the present study substitutes cysteine into one of the four loops of the γ subunit that contribute to the binding site and examines α-btx binding following reaction with sulfhydryl-specific reagents. The site-selective ligands dimethyl-d-tubocurarine and α-conotoxin M1 are then used to assess changes in the binding sites following reaction with the sulfhydryl reagents. The overall findings show that Leuγ119 and equivalent residues in the ε and δ subunits are in close proximity to the site of α-btx binding. Dimethyl-d-tubocurarine (DMT) was generously provided by Lilly. Aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA), trimethylammonium-ethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSET), and sulfonato-ethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc.;125I-labeled-α-bungarotoxin was from NEN Life Science Products; d-tubocurarine chloride was from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; α-conotoxin M1 (CTX) was from American Peptide Co.; and the 293 human embryonic kidney cell line (293 HEK) was from the American Type Culture Collection. Sources of the mouse acetylcholine receptor subunit cDNAs were as described previously (10Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Receptor subunit cDNAs were subcloned into the cytomegalovirus-based expression vector pRBG4 as described (10Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Mutant cDNAs were constructed by bridging naturally occurring or mutagenically installed restriction sites with synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides (10Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). HEK cells were transfected with mutant or wild type acetylcholine receptor subunit cDNAs using calcium phosphate precipitation as described (10Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Three days after transfection, intact cells were harvested by gentle agitation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA and collected by centrifugation. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of potassium Ringer's solution (140 mmKCl, 5.4 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.7 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES) with the pH adjusted to 7.75. A 50-fold concentrate of methanethiosulfonate reagent in water was added to the cell suspension to achieve a final concentration of 0.2 to 2 mm reagent. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min, with gentle inversion, followed by dilution with 12 ml of potassium Ringer's solution (pH 7.4) containing 0.03 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in potassium Ringer's solution and divided into aliquots for measurements of DMT or α-conotoxin M1 occupancy, which were determined by competition against the initial rate of125I-labeled α-btx binding (11Sine S.M. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3315-3325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specified concentrations of ligand were added 30 (DMT) or 60 (CTX) min prior to addition of 5 nm125I-labeled α-btx, which was allowed to bind for 30 min to occupy approximately half of the surface receptors. Binding was terminated by addition of 2 ml of potassium Ringer's solution containing 300 μm d-tubocurarine chloride. Cells were then harvested by filtration through Whatman GF-B filters using a Brandel Cell Harvester and washed four times with 3 ml of potassium Ringer's solution. Prior to use, filters were soaked in potassium Ringer's solution containing 4% skim milk for a minimum of 2 h. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10–30 mm carbamylcholine. The total number of α-btx sites was determined by incubation with 5 nm125I-labeled α-btx for 120 min. The initial rate of α-btx binding was calculated as described (11Sine S.M. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3315-3325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to yield fractional occupancy of competing ligand. Binding determinations were analyzed according to either the Hill equation (Equation 1) or the sum of two distinct binding sites (Equation 2). 1−Y=1/(1+([ligand]/Kapp*n*Equation 1 1−Y=fractA(1/(1+[ligand]/KA))Equation 2 +(1−fractA)(1/(1+[ligand]/KB))where Y is fractional occupancy by the competing ligand, n is the Hill coefficient,K app is an apparent dissociation constant,K A and K B are intrinsic dissociation constants for two binding sites, and fractA is the fraction of sites with dissociation constant K A. Fitted parameters and standard errors were determined using the program UltraFit (BIOSOFT). Of the four regions in the γ subunit that contribute to the ligand binding site, the predisulfide region (10Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) was chosen for cysteine mutagenesis. As this region contains endogenous cysteines at positions 106 and 115, these were first mutated to serine, and residues from position 116 to 121 were individually mutated to cysteine. Following cotransfection of each mutant subunit with complementary α, β, and δ subunits in 293 HEK cells, the cells were treated with one of three methanethiosulfonate reagents, and the total number of125I-α-btx sites was measured. Of the 18 combinations of mutant and reagent, only receptors harboring γL119C treated with the quaternary ammonium reagent MTSET show a significant decrease of the total number of α-btx sites (Table I). Neither the positively charged aminoethyl (MTSEA) nor the negatively charged sulfonatoethyl (MTSES) reagents affect α-btx binding capacity. The decrease of approximately 50% suggests MTSET selectively blocks one of the two ligand binding sites in γL119C receptors.Table ITotal α-bungarotoxin sites following methanethiosulfonate treatmentMutantα-btx binding sitesMTSETMTSEAMTSES%Fetal AChR: αβγδ102 ± 3107 ± 4103 ± 4 γC106S + C115S95 ± 7105 ± 3103 ± 7 γI116C98 ± 3105 ± 1103 ± 1 γY117C86 ± 1194 ± 1105 ± 6 γW118C85 ± 1105 ± 2112 ± 7 γL119C43 ± 694 ± 10103 ± 2 γP120C100 ± 599 ± 2105 ± 1 γP121C97 ± 5101 ± 696 ± 1Adult AChR: αβεδ99 ± 3117 ± 6 αT119C97 ± 698 ± 3 βQ119C98 ± 8100 ± 13 εL119C50 ± 494 ± 5 δL119C52 ± 496 ± 11The indicated mutant subunit cDNAs were coexpressed with complementary wild type subunit cDNAs.

To determine whether MTSET selectively blocks α-btx binding to the site formed by α and γL119C subunits, the site-selective ligands DMT and CTX were used to characterize the modified mutant receptors. These ligands were chosen because their selectivities for the two sites in the fetal receptor are known and opposite; DMT binds more tightly to the α-γ site (4Sine S.M. Claudio T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19369-19377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas CTX binds more tightly to the α-δ site (7Kreienkamp H.-J. Sine S.M. Maeda R.K. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8108-8114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sine S.M. Kreienkamp H.-J. Bren N. Maeda R. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Binding of these unlabeled ligands is measured by competition against the initial rate of 125I-α-btx binding. Prior to treatment with MTSET, the two binding sites of γL119C receptors bind DMT with affinities different by 45-fold (Fig. 1 Aand Table II). CTX shows even greater selectivity for the two sites, binding with dissociation constants different by 20,000-fold (Fig. 1 B and TableIII). Thus γL119C assembles normally with complementary subunits to form cell-surface receptors with ligand selectivities characteristic of the wild type fetal receptor.Table IIParameters for DMT binding to modified cysteine mutant AChRsReceptorTreatmentK AK BfractAK app(μM)nNμmμmμmαβδγL119CControl0.29 ± 0.0413 ± 1.30.53*2.3 ± 0.150.63 ± 0.024MTSET9.0 ± 0.51.0 ± 0.054MTSEA180 ± 3513 ± 0.080.35*23 ± 1.40.71 ± 0.032αβεδL121CControl0.19 ± 0.0210 ± 0.90.51.4 ± 0.110.6 ± 0.033MTSET0.26 ± 0.020.92 ± 0.063αβδεL119CControl0.95 ± 0.0915 ± 1.30.53.7 ± 0.20.74 ± 0.032MTSET14 ± 1.60.94 ± 0.092αεδβQ119CControl0.23 ± 0.067.5 ± 1.70.51.45 ± 0.140.60 ± 0.041MTSET0.17 ± 0.0211 ± 1.20.51.43 ± 0.20.58 ± 0.041αβγδ0.20 ± 0.029.5 ± 1.10.54*1.2 ± 0.10.60 ± 0.032αβδγL119K217 ± 3512 ± 1.30.43*40 ± 3.00.72 ± 0.043αβεδ0.17 ± 0.0212 ± 1.40.51.5 ± 0.150.57 ± 0.033αβεδL121K0.18 ± 0.02518 ± 680.59*3.7 ± 0.90.31 ± 0.032αβδεL119K2.1 ± 0.4427 ± 5.70.57.6 ± 0.80.77 ± 0.062αT119Kβεδ0.17 ± 0.028.5 ± 1.00.51.2 ± 0.090.56 ± 0.032αβQ119Kεδ0.18 ± 0.0310.6 ± 0.150.51.4 ± 0.230.60 ± 0.051αβδγY117CControl0.46 ± 0.0518 ± 1.80.48*2.9 ± 0.20.63 ± 0.033MTSET340 ± 912 ± 1.60.32*34 ± 3.50.71 ± 0.053αβγL119CControl0.34 ± 0.030.98 ± 0.061MTSEA30 ± 1.81.4 ± 0.111αβγY117CControl0.51 ± 0.060.82 ± 0.072MTSET198 ± 380.76 ± 0.112αβγ0.19 ± 0.011.08 ± 0.061αβγL119K230 ± 200.95 ± 0.091K A and K B are dissociation constants for DMT and fractA the fraction of A sites obtained by fitting Equation 2 to the data.

Following treatment of γL119C receptors with MTSET, only the unmodified α-δ site remains; DMT binds with a single low affinity dissociation constant close to that for binding to the unmodified α-δ site (Fig. 1 A and Table II) while CTX binds with a single high affinity dissociation constant identical to that of the unmodified α-δ site (Fig. 1 B and Table III). Thus ligands with known and opposite site selectivities demonstrate that MTSET reacts with the engineered cysteine at position 119 of the γ subunit to block α-btx binding to the α-γ site. The high degree of homology among acetylcholine receptor subunits suggests that the polypeptide chains of each subunit fold into similar basic scaffolds. Support for this basic scaffold hypothesis comes from the observation that site selectivity of DMT, CTX, and carbamylcholine can be exchanged between the γ and δ subunits by exchanging a small number of residues at equivalent positions of the primary sequence (5Prince R.J.

To determine whether residues in equivalent positions of the δ and ε subunits are functionally equivalent to Leuγ119, receptors containing either εL119C or δL121C were treated with MTSET, and the total number of α-btx sites and DMT binding were measured. As observed for receptors containing γL119C, MTSET reduces by 50% the total number of α-btx sites in receptors containing either δL121C or εL119C but has no effect on receptors containing βQ119C or αT119C (Table I). When examined for DMT binding, δL121C receptors treated with MTSET show enhanced affinity, with the dissociation constant of the single class of sites coincident with that of αε sites in the same receptors prior to treatment (Fig. 2 Aand Table II). Analogously, εL121C receptors treated with MTSET show diminished affinity for DMT, with the dissociation constant of the single class of sites coincident with that of unmodified α-δ sites (Fig. 2 B and Table II). By contrast, MTSET does not affect DMT binding to receptors containing βQ119C (Fig. 2 C). Thus cysteines placed at the equivalent positions γ119, ε119, and δ121 are equivalent in their accessibility to MTSET and in the resulting loss of α-btx binding. MTSEA, like MTSET, transfers a positively charged moiety to sulfhydryl groups, yet it does not affect the number of α-btx sites in receptors containing γL119C (Table I). Thus to determine whether MTSEA reacts with the site formed by α and γL119C subunits, binding of DMT and CTX was measured. When examined for CTX binding, γL119C receptors treated with MTSEA show two clear components, one with affinity of the unmodified α-δ site and the other with affinity too low to measure (Fig.3 A). The fraction of sites with ultra-low affinity is 35%, rather than 53% determined for unmodified receptors (Table III), suggesting that the intrinsic rate of α-btx binding to these sites is slowed. When examined for DMT binding, modified γL119C receptors show a parallel shift of the binding curve toward greater DMT concentrations (Fig. 3 B). To determine whether one or both sites are modified by MTSEA, a two-site model was fitted to the data, with the fraction of each site constrained to that determined in the parallel competition experiment with CTX (Fig. 3 A). The fitting analysis reveals a 600-fold decrease in the affinity of DMT for the modified α-γL119C site, with no change in affinity for the α-δ site; thus the parallel shift of the binding profile is due to decreased affinity of the α-γL119C site beyond that of the low affinity α-δ site (Fig.3 B and Table II). To further confirm that the large decrease in affinity is due to modification of the α-γ119C site, pentameric receptors containing two α-γL119C sites were formed by coexpressing α, β, and γ119C subunits (4Sine S.M. Claudio T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19369-19377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following treatment with MTSEA, these receptors with symmetrical sites bind DMT with 100-fold decreased affinity, similar to that observed for the α-γL119C site in asymmetric receptors (Fig. 3 C and Table II). Thus MTSEA selectively modifies the α-γL119C site, decreasing affinity for DMT and CTX. Decreased affinity caused by MTSEA is likely due to introduction of a positive charge close to or within the binding site. However, because both MTSEA and MTSET transfer positively charged groups to γL119C, block of α-btx binding by MTSET is not solely due to the positive charge but also to the extra bulk of the quaternary ammonium group transferred by MTSET. The thioethylamine moiety transferred by MTSEA resembles the side chain of lysine. Thus to further demonstrate specificity of modification by MTSEA, Leuγ119 was mutated to lysine, and α-btx, DMT, and CTX binding were measured. Coexpression of γL119K with α, β, and δ subunits yields robust expression of cell-surface receptors, with the number of α-btx binding sites comparable to that of wild type fetal receptors. When examined for CTX binding, γL119K receptors show two clear components, one with affinity of the wild type α-δ site and the other with affinity too low to measure (Fig.4 A). As observed following MTSEA treatment of γL119C receptors, the fraction of sites with ultra-low affinity is 43%, rather than 54% determined for wild type fetal receptors (Table II), suggesting that the intrinsic rate of α-btx binding to the α-γL119K site is slowed. Detection of both α-δ and α-γL119K sites shows that α-btx binds to each site in the mutant receptors. When examined for DMT binding, γL119K receptors show an apparent shift of both the high and low affinity components toward greater DMT concentrations (Fig. 4 B), similar to γL119C receptors treated with MTSEA (Fig. 3 B). To determine whether the data can be described by decreased affinity of just the α-γL119K site, a two-site model was fitted to the data, with the fraction of each site constrained to that determined in the parallel competition experiment with CTX (Fig. 4 A). The fitting analysis reveals a 1200-fold decrease in affinity of DMT for the α-γL119K site, with no change in affinity for the α-δ site (Table II). To confirm that the large decrease in affinity is due to a change in the α-γL119K site, pentameric receptors containing two α-γL119K sites were examined for DMT binding. Again DMT affinity for these symmetric receptors decreases by 1200-fold (Fig.4 C and Table II), as observed for the α-γL119K site in asymmetric receptors. Thus γL119K selectively decreases the affinity of CTX and DMT for the mutant α-γL119K site, while retaining α-btx binding to both sites. That lysine mutagenesis mimics MTSEA treatment of γL119C receptors further demonstrates specificity of the reaction of MTSEA for the α-γ site. To further test the basic scaffold hypothesis, the equivalent residues Leuε119 and Leuδ121 were mutated to lysine and coexpressed with complementary subunits from the wild type adult receptor. Measurements of DMT binding reveal a selective decrease in affinity of the site harboring the lysine mutation; δL121K receptors show decreased affinity of only the low affinity component, whereas εL119K receptors show decreased affinity of the high affinity component (Fig. 5, A andB). These decreases in affinity, although readily apparent, are smaller than observed for receptors containing γL119K, indicating that the extent of the lysine perturbation differs quantitatively among the γ, δ, and ε subunits. To test further for subunit specificity, lysine was introduced into the equivalent residues in the α and β subunits, and DMT binding was measured. No change in DMT binding was detected for receptors containing either αT119K or βQ119K mutant subunits (Fig. 5 C), as expected, since this region of the α and β subunits is thought to lie on the side of the subunit opposite to the ligand binding site. Thus the perturbation due to lysine substitution at position 119 is specific to the γ, δ, and ε subunits, further supporting the basic scaffold hypothesis. Previous studies identified the pair of equivalent residues Tyrγ117/Thrδ117 as the primary source of DMT site selectivity in fetal receptors (10Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies of side chain specificity showed that Tyrγ117 stabilizes one of two quaternary nitrogens in DMT (13Fu D.-X. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26152-26157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of its proximity to Leuγ119, Tyrγ117 was mutated to cysteine to determine whether it too is accessible to aqueous solution and whether its reaction with sulfhydryl reagents affects ligand binding. Prior to treatment with MTSET, γY117C receptors bind CTX selectivity, showing two distinct components with dissociation constants different by 4,000-fold, corresponding to the α-δ and α-γY117C sites (Fig.6 A and Table III). Following treatment with MTSET, however, two components are still present (Fig.6 A), contrary to the complete loss of the low affinity component following MTSET treatment of γL119C receptors (Fig.1 B). The component with high affinity corresponds to the unmodified α-δ site, whereas the component with affinity too low to measure corresponds to the modified α-γY117C site. The contribution of the low affinity component is 32%, rather than 48% observed for untreated γY117C receptors (Table III), suggesting that the intrinsic rate of α-btx binding is slowed. When examined for DMT binding, γY117C receptors treated with MTSET show an apparent shift of both the high and low affinity components toward greater DMT concentrations (Fig. 6 B), similar to γL119C receptors treated with MTSEA (Fig. 3 B). To determine whether the binding data can be explained by modification of just the α-γY117C site, a two-site model was fitted to the data, with the fraction of each site constrained to that determined in the parallel competition experiment with CTX (Fig. 6 A). The fitting analysis reveals a 700-fold decrease in affinity of DMT for the modified α-γY117C site, with no change in affinity for the α-δ site (Fig. 6 B and TableII). To confirm that the large decrease in affinity is due to modification of the α-γ117C site, pentameric receptors containing two α-γL117C sites were examined for DMT binding. Again MTSET treatment of these symmetric receptors decreases DMT affinity by 400-fold (Fig. 6 C and Table II), similar to that observed for the α-γY117C site in asymmetric receptors. Thus MTSET reacts selectively with the α-γY117C site to decrease affinity of CTX and DMT. The overall results indicate that while modification of cysteines at positions γ117 and γ119 similarly affects DMT and CTX binding, only MTSET modification of cysteine at position γ119 blocks α-btx binding. These experiments identify a localized region of the γ, ε, and δ subunits that contributes to α-btx binding. This region is located within one of four loops of the γ, ε, and δ subunits that contribute to binding of agonists and competitive antagonists. Cysteines placed at the equivalent positions Leuγ119, Leuδ121, and Leuε119 are chemically modified in a site-specific manner by MTSET and MTSEA, but only MTSET modification blocks binding of α-btx. Prior to modification, cysteine mutant subunits assemble normally with complementary wild type subunits and form binding sites with high affinity for α-btx and normal selectivities for the competitive antagonists DMT and CTX. Following modification by MTSET, α-btx no longer binds with high affinity to sites harboring γL119C, yet binding is retained to sites harboring γY117C where the modification is only two residues away. Modification by MTSEA does not block α-btx binding to γL119C receptors, but it markedly diminishes affinity of the competitive antagonists DMT and CTX, indicating proximity of γL119C to the ligand binding site. Lysine mutagenesis mimics modification by MTSEA, further demonstrating that modification is specific to the binding site harboring γL119C. Both MTSEA modification and lysine mutagenesis are specific to position γ119 and the equivalent positions ε119 and δ121, supporting the hypothesis that residues at equivalent positions in the primary sequences occupy equivalent positions in three-dimensional space. In addition to supporting the basic scaffold hypothesis, the findings demonstrate that the γ, δ, and ε subunits contribute to one face of the binding site, whereas equivalent portions of the α and β subunits do not. The overall findings indicate that Leuγ119 is close to or within the site of α-btx binding and that MTSET modification of γL119C creates a localized point of interaction with α-btx that prevents its binding. α-Btx belongs to the class of long neurotoxins, which consist of 71–74 amino acids folded into three loops held together by a core region of four disulfide bonds (for review see Ref. 14Lentz T. Wilson P. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1988; 29: 117-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The approximately oval toxin structure contains a convex face thought to point away from the binding site and a concave face that complements and forms a template of the receptor binding surface. Owing to the numerous positively charged residues in α-btx and the net negative charge of the acetylcholine receptor, the α-btx·receptor complex is likely formed and held together by multiple electrostatic interactions. An α-neurotoxin with a photoactivable group attached to loop 3 labels the α subunit following irradiation, while α-neurotoxin with the photoactivable group in loop 2 labels the γ and δ subunits (9Machold J. Weise C. Utkin Y. Tsetlin V. Hucho F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A simple interpretation of these findings is loop 3 faces residues in the α subunit, whereas loop 2 faces residues in the γ or δ subunits. As loop 2 of α-btx contains four positively charged residues, attachment of the quaternary ammonium group to Cysγ119may prevent binding through electrostatic repulsion. Although the α-btx·receptor complex is very stable, it forms about 3 orders of magnitude slower than for a diffusion-limited reaction. The slow rates of association and dissociation indicate that multiple interactions stabilize the initial as well as the final α-btx·receptor complex. Furthermore, the resiliency of α-btx subjected to chemical modification of many of its residues indicates that no single residue is crucial for binding (reviewed in Ref. 14Lentz T. Wilson P. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1988; 29: 117-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Following formation of the initial complex, structural rearrangements in both α-btx and the receptor may further stabilize binding, owing to the high entropic contribution of the binding reaction (15Maelicke A. Fulpuis B.W. Klett R.P. Reich E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4811-4830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MTSET modification of γL119C receptors probably disrupts formation of the initial α-btx·receptor complex by electrostatic repulsion; modification of subsequent conformational changes seems less likely owing to the complementarity and multiple points of stabilization of the final complex. The widely held concept that α-btx binds to the α subunit can be traced to its ability to bind to isolated denatured α subunits but not to β, γ, or δ subunits (16Gershoni J.M. Hawrot E. Lentz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4973-4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Also, within cells, α-btx binds to unassembled α subunits but not to unassembled non-α subunits (17Blount P. Merlie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1072-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Paulson H. Ross A. Green W. Claudio T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1371-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Proteolytic digestion of the α subunit also produces fragments that retain α-btx binding capacity (19Tzartos S.J. Changeux J.P. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Of the three loops in the α subunit that contribute to the subunit interface comprising the ligand binding site, loop C, containing residues 185 to 198, is most closely associated with α-btx binding because the synthetic dodecapeptide (α185–196) binds α-btx with micromolar affinity (20Basus V.J. Song G. Hawrot E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12290-12298Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cobra and mongoose receptors, both resistant to α-btx, contain N-linked glycosylation sites at positions 189 or 187, respectively, which markedly reduce α-btx binding (7Kreienkamp H.-J. Sine S.M. Maeda R.K. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8108-8114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from these glycosylation mutations, α-btx binding is unusually resistant to mutagenesis in this region, with little effect of αP194L, αP197H, or even αY198R (7Kreienkamp H.-J. Sine S.M. Maeda R.K. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8108-8114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Fu D.-X. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26152-26157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); these observations further support multiple points of attachment of α-btx. As noted above, an α-neurotoxin with a photoactivable group in loop 3 labels the α subunit following irradiation (9Machold J. Weise C. Utkin Y. Tsetlin V. Hucho F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting juxtaposition of loop 3 in α-btx and loop C of the α subunit. A large body of evidence from mutagenesis and site-directed labeling studies establish that the non-α subunits, γ, δ, and ε, are required to generate the binding site conformation with high affinity for small ligands and selectivity found in the native receptor. To date four discontinuous segments of these non-α subunits have been found to contribute to the binding site, leading to a four-loop model of the folding pattern of the major extracellular domain of the subunit (reviewed in Refs. 5Prince R.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25770-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and 21Tsigelny I. Sugiyama N. Sine S. Taylor P. Biophysical J. 1997; 73: 52-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because both α and non-α subunits are required to generate a binding site, it is natural to expect at least one loop of the non-α subunit close to the site of α-btx binding. Because an α-neurotoxin with a photoactivable group in loop 2 labels the γ and δ subunits following irradiation, Leuγ119and equivalent residues in the ε and δ subunits may closely approach loop 2 of α-btx in forming the initial complex. The overall results indicate a localized point of interaction between α-btx and the chemically modified γL119C. Support for a localized interaction includes (i) specificity of chemical modification for the binding site carrying the cysteine mutation; (ii) specificity of both modification and lysine mutagenesis for the γ, ε, and δ subunits; (iii) localization of the functional effect to a single residue, Leuγ119, within a segment of the γ subunit; and (iv) proximity of Leuγ119 to the binding site for the competitive antagonists DMT and CTX.

Incubation of the fresh tissue fragments with HDL containing [3H]CE or 125I-apoprotein (apo) A-I resulted in significant uptake of HDL-CE-derived label. Addition of recombinant CETP (rCETP) increased CE uptake in a dose-response fashion. In contrast, little association of 125I-apoA-I with adipose tissue was noted, and addition of rCETP did not alter apoA-I uptake or degradation. Incubation of adipose tissue with TP2, an anti-CETP monoclonal antibody, which inhibits neutral lipid transfer, markedly reduced selective uptake of HDL-CE. Studies using human adipocytes isolated by collagenase digestion also demonstrated selective uptake of HDL-CE and enhancement of this process by rCETP. To confirm that the association of HDL-CE-derived radioactivity with adipose tissue was not due to neutral lipid exchange between adipocytes and HDL, we measured changes in HDL composition following incubation of HDL and rCETP with isolated adipocytes. A decrease in HDL-CE concentration in the medium was observed, an effect which was markedly attenuated when incubations were carried out in the presence of monoclonal antibody TP2. Furthermore, the decrease in HDL-CE was accompanied by an increase in HDL free cholesterol, likely representing efflux of adipocyte cholesterol to HDL. There were no significant changes in phospholipid, apoA-I, or apoA-II in the medium following incubation with adipocytes. These data demonstrate a novel and important role for CETP in selective uptake of HDL-cholesteryl esters by human adipocytes and suggest that this pathway may be of quantitative physiological significance in HDL remodeling and adipocyte cholesterol accumulation.

Thus, CE are transferred from HDL to adipocytes by a nonendocytotic process, known as selective cholesterol uptake (6Glass C. Pittman R.C. Weinster D.B Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The selective uptake of CE by adipose cells resembles in many ways the processes described in vivo for rat liver, ovary, and adrenal (6Glass C. Pittman R.C. Weinster D.B Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5435-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) and in vitro for adrenal cells (7Glass C. Pittman R.C. Civen M. Steinberg D. J. Biol.

Acta. 1988; 959: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). While many similarities in selective cholesteryl ester uptake have been noted in several tissues, the physiological consequences vary with cellular processing. It is likely that HDL can deliver cholesterol in the esterified form to adipocytes, where it is hydrolyzed to free cholesterol, which can then be stored in the oil droplet, equilibrate with the membrane, or efflux from the cell over time (12Angel A.,. Jiminez J. Despres J-P Julien P. Zsigmond E. Fong B. Recent Adv. Obes. Res. 1987; : 222-228Google Scholar, 13Fong B. Angel A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1004: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The role of CETP in reverse cholesterol transport has been well characterized (14Tall A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). CETP is highly expressed in mammalian adipose tissue (15Jiang X.C. Moulin P. Quinet E. Goldberg I.J. Yacoub L.K. Agellon L.B. Compton D. Schnitzer-Polokoff R. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4631-4639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is also evidence of CETP activity associated with adipocyte plasma membranes (16Shen G.X. Angel A. Int. J. Obes. 1994; 18: 50-54Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that immunoreactive CETP is present on the adipocyte plasma membrane and that CETP gene expression is greatest in very small fat cells (10–50 μm), which are likely to be in a trophic phase and thus to have a particular requirement for lipoprotein cholesterol (17Radeau T. Lau P. Robb M. McDonnell M. Ailhaud G. McPherson R. J. Lipid. Res. 1995; 36: 2552-2561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This led us to test the hypothesis that human adipocyte CETP functions to facilitate uptake of HDL cholesteryl esters. Our findings demonstrate a novel function for CETP in human adipocyte cholesterol metabolism. Plasma was collected from healthy normolipemic donors. HDL (d = 1.063–1.21 g/ml) were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation (Beckman 55.2 Ti rotor, 40,000 rpm, 20 h, 8 °C). Approximately 200 μCi of [3H]cholesteryl oleate were added to 15 mg of palmityl oleyl phosphatidylcholine dissolved in chloroform and evaporated under N2. Three ml of PBS were added, and the mixture was sonicated to create palmityl oleyl phosphatidylcholine-[3H]cholesteryl oleate vesicles. The vesicles were added to the entire quantity of isolated HDL and incubated at 37 °C, overnight, with agitation to permit transfer of labeled cholesteryl oleate to HDL. Vesicles were separated from the labeled lipoproteins by ultracentrifugation (Beckman 100.4Ti rotor, 60,000 rpm, 15 h, 8 °C) and HDL (d = 1.063–1.21) were isolated by two successive ultracentrifugations (Beckman 100.4Ti rotor, 57,000 rpm, 25 h, 8 °C). Purified human apoA-I was iodinated using 125I-IODO-BEADs (32Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar). The beads were equilibrated in phosphate buffer (0.3 mNaPO4, pH 7.4) and then incubated with 20 μl of125I (2 mCi of NaI) in 70 μl of phosphate buffer for 5 min at room temperature. 150 μg of apoA-I were added to the mixture and incubated at room temperature for 45 min with agitation. Unincorporated label was removed by passing the mixture through a desalting column (Excellulose GF5, Pierce) which had been prewashed in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS followed by PBS. Labeled apoA-1 was equilibrated with 35 mg of HDL (previously isolated) at 37 °C for 4 h with gentle agitation. The density of the mixture (d = 1.21 g/ml) was adjusted with KBr and then centrifuged (Beckman 55.2 Ti rotor, 40,000 rpm, 40 h, 8 °C). To obtain doubly labeled HDL with 3H in esterified cholesterol and 125I in apoA-I, the [3H]HDL was then equilibrated with labeled apoA-I as described above. The HDL-containing fraction was dialyzed against PBS overnight and electrophoretic mobility and purity were verified by Lipogel agarose gel electrophoresis (Paragon®, Beckman Instruments) and 8–25% gradient SDS gel electrophoresis (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Lipoprotein mass was determined by measuring protein content by the method of Lowry et al. (18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subcutaneous adipose tissue was obtained from healthy normolipemic subjects undergoing reduction mammoplasty procedures for cosmetic purposes. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Ottawa Civic Hospital, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Adipose tissue fragments were prepared and maintained in organ culture using standard procedures as described previously (17Radeau T. Lau P. Robb M. McDonnell M. Ailhaud G. McPherson R. J. Lipid. Res. 1995; 36: 2552-2561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and incubated (37 °C, 5% CO2), with constant shaking, for indicated times (1–8 h) in culture medium containing labeled HDL (50 μg/ml). To determine the dose-response effect of CETP on selective uptake of HDL-CE, incubations were performed with and without the addition of physiologic quantitites (0–2.4 μg/ml) of recombinant human CETP (19Marcel Y.L. McPherson R. Hogue M. Czarnecka H. Zawadski Z. Weech P.K. Whitlock M.E. Tall A.R. Milne R.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In some studies, Fab fragments (20 μg/ml) of anti-CETP monoclonal antibodies were added 1 or 2 h prior to the addition of the labeled lipoprotein. For some experiments, small fragments of tissue were incubated with collagenase (0.5 mg/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium containing 10% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C. Adipocytes were separated from undigested tissue by filtering through a fine nylon mesh and washed three times with PBS containing bovine serum albumin (20Angel A. D'Costa M.A. Yuen R. Can. J. Biochem. 1979; 57: 578-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). HDL incubation experiments (1–18 h) were performed as described above. At the end of the incubation period, the medium containing labeled lipoproteins was removed and stored at 4 °C and the tissue was washed three times in ice cold PBS. The adipose tissue was then homogenized in homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4 containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) to isolate the membrane fraction, or in lysis buffer (0.02 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for cytosolic analysis. The homogenate in lysis buffer was centrifuged (Sorval RT 6,000D, 2,000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C) to separate the lipophilic layer (oil droplet) from the remaining homogenate (infranatant). The infranatant (cytosol and membrane) was removed. After homogenization in lysis buffer, lipids from lipophilic layer (oil droplet) were extracted as described by Folch et al. (21Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mass of total core lipid was determined by weighing lipid extract. Then, extracted lipids were redissolved in chloroform, 3H radioactivity was counted, and the amount of CE was determined with respect to initial specific activity. Results were expressed as nanograms of HDL protein/mg of total core lipid. The infranatant from tissue homogenized in homogenization buffer was ultracentrifuged (Beckman 100.4 rotor, 35,000 rpm, 8 °C, 1 h) to separate the membrane fraction (pellet) from the cytosolic fraction (supernatant). The pellet was dissolved into 1 ml of 0.1 n NaOH at room temperature, overnight. Lipids were extracted as described by Bligh and Dyer (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar), and mass of FC and PL was determined by gas liquid chromatography (23Evans A.J. Sawyer C.G. Wolfe B.M. Huff M.W. J. Biochem. 1992; 267: 10743-10748Google Scholar) and HPTLC analysis (24Macala L.J. Yu R.K. Ando S. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1243-1250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously with some modifications. Thin layer chromatography was developed in hexane/diethylether/formic acid, 80:20:2, and washed in 100% heptane. Results were expressed as percent of control (HDL prior to incubation). Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al.(18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 3H counts remaining in HDL in the medium following incubation were determined. The medium was adjusted to d = 1.21 g/ml with KBr, and HDL were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation (Beckman 45.6Ti rotor, 40,000rpm, 4 °C, 48 h). The 3H-associated radioactivity was counted. Lipids were extracted and mass was determined as described above by HPTLC and gas liquid chromatography. Results were expressed as nanograms of lipid/μg of protein. Protein was determined by Lowry assay (18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The infranatant (cytosol + membrane) removed after homogenization in lysis buffer was counted for125I radioactivity using a gamma counter. In another experiment, the infranatant was ultracentrifuged to separate the membrane fractions (pellet) from the cytosolic fraction (supernatant). Proteins from these fractions were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid methods (25Bonifacino J.S. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3. Greene Publishing and Wiley-Intersciences, New York1987: 10.18.5Google Scholar) and 125I-associated radioactivity was counted. ApoA-I was quantitated with respect to initial specific activity. Results are expressed as nanograms of HDL protein/ng of total core lipid determined as described above. ApoA-I and ApoA-II were quantified by immunoelectrodiffusion in agarose gel using the Hydragel A-I/B and A-II kit (SebiaR, France). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Significant of differences was examined using Student'st test for unpaired data. Cellular uptake of HDL tracers is shown as apparent HDL particle uptake, as indicated by the cell content of each tracer (6Glass C. Pittman R.C. Weinster D.B Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5435-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). This apparent uptake is expressed in terms of HDL protein, to compare uptake of both tracers on the same basis. The time course pattern of uptake of HDL by human adipose tissue is illustrated in Fig. 1. The uptake of cholesteryl ester from HDL was most rapid over the 1st h but continued to increase over 4 h (Fig. 1), suggesting that the adipocyte membrane capacity as a cholesteryl ester acceptor is not limiting. This experiment was repeated with HDL labeled with 125I-apoA-I to determine if the tissue-associated radioactivity was due to selective uptake of HDL-derived CE or to particle uptake. In contrast to the pattern of a continuous increase in [3H]CE uptake with time, little 125I-apoA-I became associated with adipose tissue within 30 min of incubation and the level of cell-associated 125I-apoA-I declined by 2 h and remained constant thereafter (Fig. 1). These experiments confirm the phenomenon of selective uptake of HDL-derived CE by human adipose tissue, in accord with previous reports (1Parkes J.G. Angel A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1989; 68: 870-879Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 4Despres J.P. Fong B.S. Jimenez J. Julien P Angel A. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: E667-E675PubMed Google Scholar, 5Fong B.S. Angel A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1004: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Human adipocytes synthesize and secrete CETP (15Jiang X.C. Moulin P. Quinet E. Goldberg I.J. Yacoub L.K. Agellon L.B. Compton D. Schnitzer-Polokoff R. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4631-4639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the observed selective uptake of HDL-CE could be further enhanced by exogenous CETP, 4-h incubations were performed following addition to the medium of physiological plasma concentrations (0.6, 1.2, 2.4 μg/ml) (19Marcel Y.L. McPherson R. Hogue M. Czarnecka H. Zawadski Z. Weech P.K. Whitlock M.E. Tall A.R. Milne R.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) of recombinant human CETP (rCETP). As shown in Fig.2, rCETP had a linear dose-response enhancing effect on the selective uptake of cholesteryl ester from HDL. In the absence of exogenous rCETP, there was a smaller but nonetheless significant uptake of HDL-derived cholesteryl ester by adipose tissue demonstrating that this is a physiological process, which is likely to be mediated, in part, by adipocyte CETP. In contrast to its effects on CE, increasing amounts of rCETP did not increase cell-associated125I-apoA-I, demonstrating that the observed uptake of [3H]CE by adipose tissue was not due to particle uptake (Fig. 2). The effect of exogenous rCETP (2.4 μg/ml of medium) on the time course pattern of selective uptake is shown in Fig.3. Using adipose tissue fragments obtained from another normal subject, we found that in the presence of rCETP, selective CE uptake was more rapid and continuous and did not plateau at 4 h. These data confirm that adipocyte membrane capacity as a cholesteryl ester acceptor is not limiting in presence of rCETP. Results of experiments using adipose tissue fragment from different patients (Figs. 1, 2, 3) demonstrate individual variation in the extent of selective uptake of HDL-CE possibly due to differences in adipocyte size and adipose tissue matrix composition. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against different epitopes of the CETP molecule (26Hesler C.B. Tall A.R. Swenson T.L. Weech P.K. Marcel Y.L. Milne R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5020-5023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Roy P. Mackenzie R. Hirama T. Jiang X.C. Kussie P. Tall A. Rassart E. Milne R. J. Lipid. Res. 1996; 37: 22-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used to verify that the observed HDL-CE uptake was mediated by CETP. To eliminate steric hindrance artifact, we prepared Fab fragments for these studies. The anti-CETP mAb, TP2, which reacts with an epitope in the carboxyl end of the molecule and which inhibits neutral lipid transfer (27Roy P. Mackenzie R. Hirama T. Jiang X.C. Kussie P. Tall A. Rassart E. Milne R. J. Lipid. Res. 1996; 37: 22-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), had no effect on cell-associated125I-apoA-I after a 4 h incubation (data not shown). However, TP2 reduced selective uptake of HDL-CE by human adipose tissue by 70 ± 3.5% (p = 0.03). When studies were carried out in the presence of rCETP, TP2 reduced selective uptake by 54 ± 1.4% (p = 0.05) (Fig.4) In contrast, the anti-CETP mAb, TP20, which reacts with an epitope in the amino-terminal of CETP and does not alter neutral lipid transfer (27Roy P. Mackenzie R. Hirama T. Jiang X.C. Kussie P. Tall A. Rassart E. Milne R. J. Lipid. Res. 1996; 37: 22-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not alter selective uptake (Fig.4) suggesting that the neutral lipid transfer activity of CETP is essential to this process. The observed CETP-mediated uptake was not due to CETP associated with labeled HDL since removal of trace amounts of CETP from HDL by TP2 immunoaffinity did not affect selective uptake (data not shown). It is thus likely that CETP endogenously synthesized by adipocytes mediates selective uptake of HDL-CE by adipose tissue, accounting for the TP2-inhibitable selective uptake of HDL-CE. Although the neutralizing mAb, TP2, reduced selective uptake, this effect was not enhanced when the concentration of TP2 was doubled, indicating that the levels added were sufficient to block most, but not all, HDL-CE uptake. Thus, additional mechanisms, not involving CETP, may account for a portion of the selective uptake of HDL-derived CE by human adipose tissue. Adipose tissue contains adipocytes and other cell types including endothelial cells, fibroblasts and macrophages. To ascertain that these other adipose tissue constituents were not responsible for selective uptake, we studied the uptake of HDL-CE and its stimulation in presence of rCETP using isolated human adipocytes. When studies were carried out with singly ([3H]CE) or doubly labeled ([3H]CE and 125I-apoA-I) HDL, results were similar to experiments performed with adipose tissue fragments, indicating an increase in CE uptake over time and association of125I-apoA-I with adipocytes after 1-h incubation followed by a slow decline in cell associated apoA-I counts over 18 h (Fig.5). These data were confirmed by quantification of apoA-I protein associated with adipocyte cytosol and membrane. Our results indicate that when HDL is incubated with adipocytes or adipose tissue, a small amount of apoA-I associates with the adipocyte membrane before being released or degraded. Trichloroacetic acid precipitation of 125I-apoA-I derived counts revealed that only 20 ± 5% of the small fraction of apoA-I which became associated with adipocytes was taken up and degraded. To verify that the apoA-I labeling protocol did not alter the HDL composition, this experiment was performed with doubly labeled HDL with125I-apoA-I and [3H]CE. Comparison of singly and doubly labeled HDL revealed that there was no effect of the labeling procedure on HDL particle composition (PL, FC, CE, apoA-I, and apoA-II). Nor was there an effect of the labeling procedure on the time-course pattern of HDL-CE uptake (data not shown). For studies with doubly labeled HDL particles, we measured only cell associated,125I-apoA-I derived radioactivity since γ counts could be determined without interference of β counts (Fig. 5). The phenomenon of selective uptake of HDL-CE was clearly demonstrable in studies with isolated adipocytes (Fig.6). Compared with above data (Figs. 2 and3), albeit from different subjects, it appears that the effect of rCETP on selective uptake of HDL-CE may be greater in isolated adipocytes than in adipose tissue fragments (10-fold versus 2–5-fold increase in CE uptake, respectively). The removal of the adipose tissue matrix in primary adipocyte cultures may explain the enhanced effect of rCETP on selective uptake of HDL-CE. We also measured changes in HDL lipid and protein composition and adipocyte membrane cholesterol before and after incubation with the cells. After 4 h of incubation of HDL with primary adipocytes, the CE content of HDL decreased by 37% (p = 0.01). In contrast, the free cholesterol mass increased 9-fold (p= 0.0001), whereas the PL content (Fig.7) and ratio of apoA-I/apoA-II (data not shown) were not affected. No change in HDL-TG content was detectable by enzymatic assay (data not shown). When HDL was incubated with adipose tissue in the absence of added rCETP, adipocyte plasma membrane cholesterol decreased by 30% after 4 h of incubation (Fig. 9), likely representing efflux, to HDL, of adipocyte membrane cholesterol (endogenous membrane cholesterol as well as free cholesterol derived from CE acquired from HDL). In the presence of rCETP (2.4 μg/ml), the cholesterol content of the membrane was restored to baseline (Fig. 8). This likely reflects the balance of increased CE uptake mediated by rCETP, CE hydrolysis, transfer of FC to both membrane and core lipid compartments and continued cholesterol efflux to HDL (Fig. 8). Addition of rCETP (2.4 μg/ml) to the medium containing HDL incubated with adipocytes did not alter the FC and PL composition of HDL but induced a further and significant 23% decrease in HDL-CE compared with a control without addition of rCETP (p = 0.023) (Fig. 7). This effect was markedly attenuated when incubations were carried out in the presence of the neutralizing mAb, TP2 (data not shown). Adipose tissue is composed of adipocytes and adipocyte precursors interspaced in an abundant capillary layer, held together by connective tissue. Freshly isolated human fat cells studied ex vivomaintain the properties of in vivo cells (3Fong B.S. Rodrigues P.O Salter A.M. Yip B.P. Despres J.P. Angel A. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75(6): 1804-1812Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28Despres J.P. Fong B.S. Jiminez J. Julien P. Angel A. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: E654-E659PubMed Google Scholar) in terms of HDL binding and cholesterol uptake. Adipocytes have very limited capacity for cholesterol synthesis and are highly dependent on lipoproteins as a source of cholesterol to maintain a relatively fixed ratio of cholesterol to triglyceride in the core lipid droplet. We have defined a novel role for CETP in mediating the selective uptake of HDL-derived CE by human adipocytes. Adipocytes synthesize and secrete CETP and selectively acquire CE from HDL. These studies demonstrate that selective uptake of HDL-CE by human adipocytes can be further enhanced in a dose-response fashion by addition of rCETP and blocked by incubation with the neutralizing mAb, TP2. The preferential uptake of HDL-cholesteryl ester is not unique to adipocytes and has been observed in cultured adrenal cells (7Glass C. Pittman R.C. Civen M. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 744-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Leitersdorf E. Stein O. Eisenberg S. Stein Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 796: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and other steroidogenic cells. Similarly, the majority of HDL-CE clearance in the rat does not involve particle uptake (6Glass C. Pittman R.C. Weinster D.B Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5435-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 29Goldberg D.I. Beltz W.F. Pittman R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 30Woolett L.A. Spady D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1704-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In HepG2 cells, CETP has been shown to mediate the transfer of HDL-CE to newly secreted lipoproteins which are then retaken up by the liver (31Rinninger F. Pittman R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6111-6118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in human liver, there is no evidence that CETP mediates direct cellular uptake of cholesteryl esters but CETP does, nonetheless, play an important role in an indirect and quantitatively important pathway for the clearance of HDL-CE (29Goldberg D.I. Beltz W.F. Pittman R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, in adipocytes and steroidogenic cells which do not secrete apoB lipoproteins, more direct mechanisms for selective uptake of HDL-CE are likely to be operative. In transfected COS cells, SR-B1, a member of the scavenger receptor superfamily, has been shown to mediate the selective uptake of HDL-CE (32Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive SR-B1 is present in high concentrations in adrenal, ovary and testes and may mediate selective uptake of HDL-CE by these tissues (32Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar). Although adipocytes have been reported to express SR-B1 mRNA in some (33Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) but not other studies (35Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), they appear to express no (33Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), or negligible amounts of immunoreactive SR-B1 protein (34Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to determine whether human adipocytes express SR-B1 and its role if any in adipocyte cholesterol homeostasis. The role of CETP in reverse cholesterol transport has been well characterized (14Tall A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). CETP is highly expressed in mammalian adipose tissue (15Jiang X.C. Moulin P. Quinet E. Goldberg I.J. Yacoub L.K. Agellon L.B. Compton D. Schnitzer-Polokoff R. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4631-4639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that human adipose tissue, in organ culture, synthesizes and secretes CETP (17Radeau T. Lau P. Robb M. McDonnell M. Ailhaud G. McPherson R. J. Lipid. Res. 1995; 36: 2552-2561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that immunoreactive CETP is present on the plasma membrane. There is also evidence of neutral lipid transfer activity associated with adipocyte plasma membranes and, interestingly, this has been demonstrated in species which lack immunoreactive CETP or neutral lipid transfer activity in plasma (16Shen G.X. Angel A. Int. J. Obes. 1994; 18: 50-54Google Scholar). Adipocyte membrane cholesterol is a modifiable pool of cholesterol and cholesterol concentrations vary in different metabolic states (17Radeau T. Lau P. Robb M. McDonnell M. Ailhaud G. McPherson R. J. Lipid. Res. 1995; 36: 2552-2561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This study demonstrates that adipocyte membrane cholesterol is decreased following a 4 h incubation with HDL and that this decrease in membrane cholesterol can be prevented by addition of rCETP to the media (Fig. 8). In other studies, we have reported that CETP mRNA abundance is significantly correlated with membrane cholesterol (17Radeau T. Lau P. Robb M. McDonnell M. Ailhaud G. McPherson R. J. Lipid. Res. 1995; 36: 2552-2561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that there is a pool of membrane cholesterol which regulates CETP gene expression. The requirement for exogeneous lipoprotein derived cholesterol would be expected to be greatest for immature lipid poor adipocytes and, consistent with this hypothesis, we have shown that CETP mRNA abundance is greater in very small fat cells (10–50 μm in diameter) in comparison to mature adipocytes (50–200 μm) (17Radeau T. Lau P. Robb M. McDonnell M. Ailhaud G. McPherson R. J. Lipid. Res. 1995; 36: 2552-2561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present experiments, following incubation of HDL with adipose tissue, we noted a significant decrease in HDL-CE (Fig. 7), consistent with the observed uptake of [3H]CE-derived counts by adipose tissue. In addition, the ratio of FC to PL increased in HDL and decreased in the adipocyte membrane suggesting net movement of free cholesterol to HDL in accord with previous studies showing net efflux of adipocyte free cholesterol to HDL acceptor particles (36Barbaras R. Puchois P. Fruchart J.C. Ailhaud G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The transfer of free cholesterol between cells and HDL particles is likely to be bidirectional, involving diffusion of cholesterol in the aqueous space between the plasma membrane and the lipoprotein surface (37Bamberger M.S. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3693-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 38Johnson W.J. Bamberger M.J. Latta R.A. Rapp P.E. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5766-5776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Phillips M.C. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 223-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 40Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4775-4782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When these incubations were carried out in the presence of rCETP, HDL was further depleted of CE, and adipocyte membrane cholesterol was restored to base line. These changes in HDL and adipocyte membrane lipid composition are likely to reflect the balance of CE uptake which is facilitated by CETP, CE hydolysis, transfer of free cholesterol to the core lipid droplet and plasma membrane, and efflux of free cholesterol to HDL. Following incubation of HDL with adipose tissue either in the presence or absence of rCETP, no change in the ratio of apoA-I to apoA-II in HDL or in the concentration of adipocyte membrane-associated apoA-I was noted. Preferential cholesteryl ester uptake by adipocytes and steroidogenic cells implies that HDL can deliver cholesterol without undergoing catabolic degradation through a lysosomal process. It is likely that there are several independent regulatory mechanisms at various stages between the delivery of HDL-CE to the adipocyte plasma membrane and subsequent uptake and intracellular metabolism. Little is known regarding cholesterol exchange between core and membrane cholesterol. Despite a disproportionate uptake of HDL core lipid, the process may not be completely independent of HDL-apolipoprotein interaction and cholesteryl ester transfer to the adipocyte may involve a specific apolipoprotein. In previous studies, using isolated human adipocytes, a correlation between HDL binding and cholesteryl ester uptake was demonstrated (4Despres J.P. Fong B.S. Jimenez J. Julien P Angel A. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: E667-E675PubMed Google Scholar). The nonendocytotic mechanism for selective uptake may be mediated by an interaction with a cell surface lipoprotein binding domain. Cultured adipocytes actively synthesize and secrete apoE and lipoprotein lipase (41Zechner R. Moser R. Newman T.C. Fried S.K. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10583-10588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) which bind lipoprotein lipase and apoE (42Misra K.B. Kim K.C. Cho S. Low M.G. Bensadoun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23838-23844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adipocytes express various receptors involved in lipoprotein catabolism, including the LDL-receptor (43Kraemer F.B. Sather S.A. Park B. Sztalryd C. Natu V. May K. Nishimura H. Simpson I. Cooper A.D. Cushman S.W. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1760-1772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), LDL-related receptor protein (44Descamps O. Bilheimer D. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 974-981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and very low density lipoprotein-receptor (45Niemeier A. Gafvels M. Heeren J. Meyer N. Angelin B. Beisiegel U. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1733-1742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known about the interaction between these molecules and the adipocyte membrane. The fact that the effect of rCETP on selective uptake is greater when HDL is incubated with isolated adipocytes as compared with adipose tissue fragments suggests that the collagenous matrix of adipose tissue may have impeded the effect of exogenous rCETP on selective uptake. Other components of the matrix surrounding adipocytes may, however, mediate lipoprotein interactions. In other experiments (data not shown) disruption of the adipose tissue HSPG matrix with heparinases, reduced selective uptake of HDL-CE, suggesting that HSPG may facilitate the interaction of HDL with the adipocyte plasma membrane. Further studies are under way to determine whether CETP-mediated uptake of HDL-derived CE by adipocytes is dependent upon interaction of apoA-I or apoE with the adipocyte membrane or HSPG complex. These data demonstrate that CETP plays a novel and important role in the selective uptake of CE from HDL by human adipocytes and suggest that this pathway may be of quantitative physiological significance in HDL remodeling and adipocyte cholesterol accumulation. Obesity is commonly associated with hypoalphalipoproteinemia even in the absence of hypertriglyceridemia and it is possible that CETP-mediated clearance of HDL-CE by adipose tissue may contribute to this phenotype.

https://openalex.org/W2062308668,"CheY, the response regulator of bacterial chemotaxis, plays a pivotal role in signal transduction in bacterial chemotaxis and interacts with at least three proteins: CheA, FliM, and CheZ. CheA receives signals from chemoreceptors and then transfers the signal to CheY by a phosphotransfer reaction. Phosphorylated CheY binds to FliM, one of the switch proteins, resulting in a change in flagellar rotation from counterclockwise to clockwise. Phosphorylated CheY is dephosphorylated by its intrinsic autophosphatase activity and by CheZ. The CheA- and FliM-binding surfaces of CheY have been well studied, but characterization of the CheZ-binding surface of CheY is incomplete. We have analyzed the effect of CheZ on the dephosphorylation rates of 14 mutants of CheY. Nine mutant CheY proteins showed more resistance to CheZ phosphatase activity than did wild-type CheY. These nine mutant CheY proteins could be divided into two groups: one with altered CheZ binding and the other with normal CheZ binding. The mutations causing reduced CheZ binding altered residues on the same surface of CheY, a region consisting of the β5-α5 loop, the α1-helix, and part of the α5-helix. Mutations rendering CheY resistant to CheZ, isolated by Sanna et al. (Sanna, M. G., Swanson, R. V., Bourret, R. B., and Simon, M. I. (1995) Mol. Microbiol. 15, 1069–1079), were also found to affect this surface. The mutations in the CheY protein that affect CheZ activity but not CheZ binding are located in the β4-α4 loop, which appears to be involved in the catalytic activity of CheZ. Finally, our results indicate that the CheY surfaces that bind CheA, FliM, and CheZ overlap, but are not completely identical.

https://openalex.org/W2145921252,"The Dictyostelium MAP kinase ERK2 is activated by extracellular cAMP in aggregation-competent cells and is required for receptor activation of adenylyl cyclase (Maeda, M., Aubry, L., Insall, R., Gaskins, C., Devreotes, P. N., and Firtel, R. A. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 3351–3354; Segall, J., Kuspa, A., Shaulsky, G., Ecke, M., Maeda, M., Gaskins, C., Firtel, R., and Loomis, W. (1995) J. Cell Biol. 128, 405–413). This cAMP-dependent activation of ERK2 is mediated by the serpentine, G protein-coupled cAMP receptors. However, ERK2 activation by cAMP is at least partially heterotrimeric G protein-independent, with a level of activation in cells lacking the sole Gβ subunit or the G protein-coupled cAMP receptors-coupled Gα2 subunit that is ∼50% that of wild-type cells (Maeda, M., Aubry, L., Insall, R., Gaskins, C., Devreotes, P. N., and Firtel, R. A. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 3351–3354; Segall, J., Kuspa, A., Shaulsky, G., Ecke, M., Maeda, M., Gaskins, C., Firtel, R., and Loomis, W. (1995) J. Cell Biol. 128, 405–413). Folic acid, a chemoattractant in the vegetative cells that enables amoebae to find bacteria in the wild, also triggers the activation of adenylyl cyclase, which is impaired in the vegetative cells lacking the Gα protein subunit Gα4 (Hadwiger, J., Lee, S., and Firtel, R. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 10566–10570). In this study, we show that folic acid activates ERK2 in developmentally regulated manner and is required for ERK2 stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity. Maximum levels of folate-stimulated ERK2 activity occur in cells from very early in development, prior to aggregation, and again at the tipped aggregate stages, corresponding to the stages in which folate receptors and the coupled Gα subunit Gα4 are maximally expressed. During the activation by folic acid, ERK2 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residue(s) and contemporaneously shows a mobility shift on SDS-PAGE. Interestingly, this activation is not elicited in the absence of Gβ subunits, in contrast to the response to cAMP. This response also requires the Gα4 subunit known to be required for other folic acid-mediated responses (Hadwiger, J., Lee, S., and Firtel, R. (1994)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 10566–10570). Furthermore, we show that the activation of ERK2 by cAMP is independent of the Gα4 subunit, while the activation of ERK2 by folate is independent of Gα2. Taken together, these data indicate that there are at least two pathways of ERK2 activation, heterotrimeric G protein-dependent and -independent pathways. The Dictyostelium MAP kinase ERK2 is activated by extracellular cAMP in aggregation-competent cells and is required for receptor activation of adenylyl cyclase (Maeda, M., Aubry, L., Insall, R., Gaskins, C., Devreotes, P.

In Dictyostelium, three presumably independent MAP kinase cascades play essential regulatory roles during both growth and multicellular development. The MAP kinase kinase (MEK) DdMEK1 is required for chemotaxis toward cAMP during aggregation; ddmek1 null cells form very small aggregates but continue to differentiate into normally proportioned, but very small, fruiting bodies (14Ma, H., Gamper, M., Parent, C., and Firtel, R. A. (1997)EMBO J. , 16, in press.Google Scholar). DdMEK1 is specifically required at the time of cAMP stimulation for the activation of guanylyl cyclase and the production of cGMP, the second messenger for chemotaxis in these cells. Two MAP kinases, ERK1 and ERK2, have been identified and their functions characterized. ERK1 is required for vegetative growth and is thought to play roles during multicellular development (15Gaskins C. Maeda M. Firtel R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 996-7012Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar), while ERK2 is required for the activation of adenylyl cyclase by the chemoattractant cAMP during aggregation, prespore-specific gene expression, and morphogenesis (2Segall J. Kuspa A. Shaulsky G. Ecke M. Maeda M. Gaskins C. Firtel R. Loomis W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 16Gaskins C. Clark A. Aubry L. Segall J. Firtel R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). erk2 null cells are aggregation-deficient due to the inability to activate adenylyl cyclase and relay the cAMP signal but show normal activation of guanylyl cyclase, which couples to chemotaxis (17Chen M.Y. Insall R.H. Devreotes P.N. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 52-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). erk2 null cells expressing a temperature-sensitive ERK2 show abnormal morphogenesis during the multicellular stages, as well as the inability to induce prespore gene expression when shifted to a nonpermissive temperature. ERK2 activity is induce ∼40-fold in aggregation-stage cells in response to extracellular cAMP. As expected from their aggregation-stage phenotypes, ERK2 activation is independent of DdMEK1 function. ERK2 is activated by cAMP through the G protein-coupled cAMP receptors cAR1 and cAR3, but the activation occurs to a level ∼50% that of wild-type cells in cells in which the gene encoding the only Gβ subunit or the gene encoding the Gα subunit known to couple to cAR1 and cAR3 (Gα2) is disrupted, indicating that cAMP receptor-mediated ERK2 activation is at least partially G protein-independent (1Maeda M.

Maeda M. Gaskins C. Firtel R. Loomis W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This pathway is positively regulated by cAMP-dependent PKA and negatively regulated by Ras pathways (18Aubry L. Maeda M. Insall R. Devreotes P.N. Firtel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3883-3886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), although another group has conflicting data on some of these points (Ref. 3Knetsch M.L.W. Epskamp S.J.P. Schenk P.W. Wang Y.W. Segall J.E. Snaar-Jagalska B.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3361-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar; see below). ERK2 is also regulated by components of the adenylyl cyclase pathway such as CRAC (18Aubry L. Maeda M. Insall R. Devreotes P.N. Firtel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3883-3886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Dictyostelium cells also undergo chemotaxis to other extracellular signals, including folic acid, which is produced by bacteria and is thought to be used by Dictyostelium cells to locate food in the wild (19Pan P. Hall E. Bonner J. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 237: 181-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The folate response is present in vegetatively growing cells but is maximal in cells that have been starved for 0.5–2 h (19Pan P. Hall E. Bonner J. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 237: 181-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 20de Wit R.J.W. Bulgakov R. de Wit T.F.R. Konijn T.M. Differentiation. 1986; 32: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), decreases significantly during aggregation (19Pan P. Hall E. Bonner J. Nat.

Differentiation. 1986; 32: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), which is the time of maximal cAMP responsiveness (17Chen M.Y. Insall R.H. Devreotes P.N. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 52-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and is reacquired at the tipped aggregate stage, when cells are responsive to both folate and the pterin monapterine. In addition to stimulating the activation of guanylyl cyclase and chemotaxis, folate also elicits the activation of adenylyl cyclase in vegetative cells and cells during early development. Folate and monapterine elicit a similar response during the multicellular stages (4Hadwiger J. Lee S. Firtel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10566-10570Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 20de Wit R.J.W. Bulgakov R. de Wit T.F.R. Konijn T.M.

These folate-mediated responses require the Gα subunit Gα4 (4Hadwiger J. Lee S. Firtel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10566-10570Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The folate and monapterine responsiveness at the tipped aggregate stage may be involved in morphogenetic movements and cell-type differentiation and coincides with a stage-specific requirement of Gα4 for these processes (4Hadwiger J. Lee S. Firtel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10566-10570Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21Tillinghast H. Newell P. J.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).In this report, we investigate the possible regulation of ERK2 by folate-mediated pathways. We show that folic acid activates ERK2 in developmentally regulated manner, this activation is paralleled by a mobility shift of ERK2 on SDS-PAGE and phosphorylation on tyrosine residue(s), ERK2 activation requires heterotrimeric G proteins containing the Gα4 subunit, and ERK2 is activated by monapterine in cells at the tipped aggregate stage. As has been observed previously for cAMP (2Segall J. Kuspa A. Shaulsky G. Ecke M. Maeda M. Gaskins C. Firtel R. Loomis W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we show that ERK2 is required for folate stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. We propose that there are two pathways leading to ERK2 activation; folic acid activates ERK2 via a completely G protein-dependent pathway, while cAMP activates ERK2 by pathways that are at least partially G protein-independent.DISCUSSIONExtracellular signal-regulated kinases, ERKs or MAP kinases, are mediators for the transmission of extracellular signals to their respective targets. In Dictyostelium, ERK2 plays essential roles in cell aggregation, prespore-specific gene expression, and morphogenesis during multicellular development (2Segall J. Kuspa A. Shaulsky G. Ecke M. Maeda M. Gaskins C. Firtel R. Loomis W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 16Gaskins C. Clark A. Aubry L. Segall J. Firtel R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been demonstrated that ERK2 is required for cAMP stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity and erk2 null cells are aggregation-deficient, as they are unable to relay the cAMP signal (1Maeda M. Aubry L. Insall R. Gaskins C. Devreotes P.N. Firtel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3351-3354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar,2Segall J. Kuspa A. Shaulsky G. Ecke M. Maeda M. Gaskins C. Firtel R. Loomis W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Analysis of an ERK2 temperature-sensitive mutation suggests that the requirement of ERK2 for prespore gene expression, and possibly morphogenesis, is distinct from its role in activating adenylyl cyclase (16Gaskins C. Clark A. Aubry L. Segall J. Firtel R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this manuscript, we show that ERK2 is also activated by folic acid in cells at the interface between vegetative growth and starvation and at the time of tip formation, the times during development when folate receptors (binding sites) and Gα4 expression are maximal. We demonstrated ERK2 activation using in-gel assays of whole cell extracts made from stimulated and unstimulated cells as previously employed for cAMP-stimulation studies. In addition, for the first time, we directly assayed purified His6-tagged ERK2. These later analyses present additional proof that we are directly measuring ERK2 activity. We show that ERK2 is activated by both folate, which binds to and activates the early (growth/early development) and late (tip stage) receptors, and monapterine, a ligand that binds to and activates late receptors (4Hadwiger J. Lee S. Firtel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10566-10570Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21Tillinghast H. Newell P. J. Cell Sci. 1987; 87: 45-53PubMed Google Scholar). We also show that folate stimulation of ERK2 activity is G protein-dependent and requires the Gβ and Gα4 subunits. Moreover, we demonstrate that ERK2 is required for folate stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity, consistent with ERK2's known role in cAMP stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity during aggregation.Previous studies have shown that Gα4 has multiple functions during the life cycle, and it is required for all previously known folate-mediated responses (4Hadwiger J. Lee S. Firtel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10566-10570Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These responses include folate-mediated chemotaxis, which is thought to be part of a food-seeking response of starved cells that is present during growth, for the first few hours after food is depleted, and before the cells initiate aggregation (19Pan P. Hall E. Bonner J. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 237: 181-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Gα4 also plays essential roles at the tip/finger stages of development (22Hadwiger J.A. Firtel R.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), being required for proper morphogenesis and cell-type differentiation. The time of Gα4 function corresponds with the time of expression of Gα4 from its late promoter and the appearance of the late folate receptors (4Hadwiger J. Lee S. Firtel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10566-10570Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 20de Wit R.J.W. Bulgakov R. de Wit T.F.R. Konijn T.M. Differentiation. 1986; 32: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 21Tillinghast H. Newell P. J. Cell Sci. 1987; 87: 45-53PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that Gα4 is required to respond to specific morphogens at this stage of development that function through the late folate receptors and that these pathways are essential for the developmental transitions after tip formation (4Hadwiger J. Lee S. Firtel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10566-10570Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It is not thought that folate per se is the ligand at the tipped mound stage, but it is a convenient agonist for at least some of the pathways studied in the laboratory. Analysis of the ERK2ts mutant indicated that ERK2 also plays an essential role at this stage of development (16Gaskins C. Clark A. Aubry L. Segall J. Firtel R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that the late ERK2 functions are mediated by both cAMP and the endogenous folate receptor ligand through cAMP and folate receptors, respectively. The possible role of ERK2 in mediating the activation of adenylyl cyclase by folate in these pathways is not known.Our analysis has shown that folate activation of ERK2 exhibits kinetics of activation and adaptation similar to those we previously observed for cAMP stimulation of ERK2. However, in contrast to our findings that cAMP can stimulate ERK2 activity through the serpentine cAMP receptors to a level that is ∼50% that of wild-type cells in gβ orgα2 null cells and is thus at least partially G protein-independent, ERK2 activation by folate is fully G protein-dependent. Activation requires both the only known Gβ subunit and the Gα4 subunit, which is required for all other known folate-mediated responses (see above). Thus, our present analysis of the various available mutations suggests that ERK2 can be activated by both G protein-dependent and -independent pathways. Activation by cAMP may proceed through these two pathways, both of which may be required for maximal activation during aggregation, while the folate pathway requires heterotrimeric G proteins. However, it is not known if this pathway is directly mediated by subunits of the heterotrimeric G protein containing Gα4 or if this G protein couples to the putative G protein-independent pathway used by the cAMP receptors. As the same gβ null strain was used for both the folate and cAMP studies on ERK2 activation (1Maeda M. Aubry L. Insall R. Gaskins C. Devreotes P.N. Firtel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3351-3354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and some of these studies were performed simultaneously, we conclude that the observed differences in the requirement for G proteins for cAMP and folate responses are not due to strain differences or other uncontrolled experimental effects. Furthermore, we show that single mutations in the genes encoding Gα1, Gα2, Gα5, Gα7, and Gα8 have no discernible effect on folate stimulation of ERK2 activity, suggesting that they are not required in this pathway. We cannot exclude redundant functions of these Gα subunits, although all previous data have suggested that the different Gα subunits have distinct functions (33Wu L.J. Gaskins C. Zhou K.M. Firtel R.A. Devreotes P.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 34Hadwiger J.A. Natarajan K. Firtel R.A.

Development. 1994; 120: 3549-3561PubMed Google Scholar).We find that cAMP stimulation of ERK2 activity is normal ingα4 null cells. This represents a control for the lack of folate stimulation of ERK2 in this strain, as it indicates thatgα4 null cells are not deficient in a possible, essential component of the signaling pathway that is required for both folate and cAMP stimulation of ERK2. While these results are in conflict with a finding of another group that Gα4 is required cAMP-stimulation of ERK2 (3Knetsch M.L.W. Epskamp S.J.P. Schenk P.W. Wang Y.W. Segall J.E. Snaar-Jagalska B.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3361-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), our observations are consistent with the facts that ERK2 is required for cAMP stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (2Segall J. Kuspa A. Shaulsky G. Ecke M. Maeda M. Gaskins C. Firtel R. Loomis W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and that cAMP stimulation of adenylyl cyclase is normal in gα4 null cells (4Hadwiger J. Lee S. Firtel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10566-10570Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Folate-mediated chemotaxis in vegetative and very early starved cells is considered a food-seeking mechanism (see above). As with cAMP-mediated chemotaxis during aggregation, this pathway requires receptor/G protein stimulation of guanylyl cyclase activity, and chemotaxis is thought to proceed via the same pathway as during aggregation. However, folate can also stimulate adenylyl cyclase, which we have shown requires ERK2 activation. The physiological significance of folate-mediated ERK2 and adenylyl cyclase activity is probably not for the relay of cAMP but for the activation of cAMP-dependent protien kinase, which is required at multiple stages of the life cycle (41Mann S.K.O.M.

Interestingly, a more primitive Dictyostelium species, D. minutum, exploits a folic acid-related compound as a chemoattractant in the aggregation stage, suggesting chemotaxis toward folic acid and other folate-mediated responses may be very ancient in this group of organisms (50de Wit R.J.W. Konijn T.M. Cell Diff. 1983; 12: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The requirement of ERK2 and Gα4 at the tipped mound stage may be due in part to a potential role of folate-related molecules in controlling both cell movement and cell-type differentiation, as is known to be the case for extracellular cAMP. Further study of the downstream pathways regulated by ERK2 should help elucidate additional components in and the role of these signal transduction cascades.

https://openalex.org/W1971040655,"In this study, we examined the potential role of serine/threonine protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1) and PP-2A in the mechanism of Na+/K+-ATPase activation by insulin in the rat skeletal muscle cell line L6. Incubation of L6 cells with insulin caused a time- and dose-dependent stimulation of ouabain-sensitive plasma membrane Na+/K+-ATPase activity. Pretreatment with okadaic acid (OA; 0.1–1 μm) or calyculin A (1 μm) blocked insulin's effect on Na+/K+-ATPase activation. Low concentrations of OA that specifically inhibit PP-2A were ineffective. Immunoprecipitation of the enzyme from 32P-labeled cells with an antibody directed against the α-1 subunit of the enzyme revealed a 60% decrease in 110-kDa protein phosphorylation in insulin-treated cells. The presence of calyculin A blocked insulin-mediated dephosphorylation of Na+/K+-ATPase, whereas low concentrations of OA were ineffective. To further confirm the role of PP-1, we used L6 cell lines that overexpress the glycogen/SR-associated regulatory subunit of PP-1, PP-1G. Overexpression of PP-1G resulted in a 3-fold increase in insulin-stimulated PP-1 catalytic activity. This was accompanied by a 30% increase in basal Na+/K+-ATPase activity and a >2-fold increase in insulin's effect on pump activity. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase with wortmannin blocked insulin-stimulated PP-1 activation as well as the dephosphorylation and activation of Na+/K+-ATPase. We conclude that insulin regulates the activity of Na+/K+-ATPase by promoting dephosphorylation of the α subunit via an insulin-stimulated PP-1 and that phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-generated signals may mediate insulin activation of PP-1 and Na+/K+-ATPase. In this study, we examined the potential role of serine/threonine protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1) and PP-2A in the mechanism of Na+/K+-ATPase activation by insulin in the rat skeletal muscle cell line L6. Incubation of L6 cells with insulin caused a time- and dose-dependent stimulation of ouabain-sensitive plasma membrane Na+/K+-ATPase activity. Pretreatment with okadaic acid (OA; 0.1–1 μm) or calyculin A (1 μm) blocked insulin's effect on Na+/K+-ATPase activation. Low concentrations of OA that specifically inhibit PP-2A were ineffective. Immunoprecipitation of the enzyme from 32P-labeled cells with an antibody directed against the α-1 subunit of the enzyme revealed a 60% decrease in 110-kDa protein phosphorylation in insulin-treated cells. The presence of calyculin A blocked insulin-mediated dephosphorylation of Na+/K+-ATPase, whereas low concentrations of OA were ineffective. To further confirm the role of PP-1, we used L6 cell lines that overexpress the glycogen/SR-associated regulatory subunit of PP-1, PP-1G. Overexpression of PP-1G resulted in a 3-fold increase in insulin-stimulated PP-1 catalytic activity. This was accompanied by a 30% increase in basal Na+/K+-ATPase activity and a >2-fold increase in insulin's effect on pump activity. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase with wortmannin blocked insulin-stimulated PP-1 activation as well as the dephosphorylation and activation of Na+/K+-ATPase. We conclude that insulin regulates the activity of Na+/K+-ATPase by promoting dephosphorylation of the α subunit via an insulin-stimulated PP-1 and that phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-generated signals may mediate insulin activation of PP-1 and Na+/K+-ATPase. Na+/K+-ATPase is a ubiquitous enzyme essential for the maintenance of electrolyte balance, preservation of membrane potential, and control of cellular volume in all tissues (1Lingrel J.B Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19659-19662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme is composed of a 112-kDa catalytic α subunit, of which there are three isoforms, and a 35-kDa β subunit (two isoforms) responsible for targeting the α subunit to the plasma membrane and maintaining its structural integrity (1Lingrel J.B Kuntzweiler T.

Recent studies on purified enzyme preparations as well as intact cells indicate that Na+/K+-ATPase activity may be regulated acutely by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions (2Ewart E.H.

Thus, phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit (α subunit) of Na+/K+-ATPase by protein kinase A and protein kinase C (PKC) 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; PP, protein phosphatase; OA, okadaic acid; caly-A, calyculin A; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI3, phosphatidylinositol-3; PKC, protein kinase B; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. in vitroinhibits enzymatic activity (7Bertorello A.M.

The exact link between the physiological effects and the direct phosphorylation of Na+/K+-ATPase is unclear, however. Insulin acutely stimulates the activities of ouabain-sensitive α-1 and α-2 isoforms of Na+/K+-ATPase in rat skeletal muscle and adipocytes (2Ewart E.H. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C295-C311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8McGill D.L. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15824-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Marette A. Krischer J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 5040-5043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In adipocytes, the acute effects of insulin on the Na+/K+ pump are due to an increase in the V max of the α-2 isoform and a decrease in the K0.5Na+ of the α-1 isoform (8McGill D.L. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15824-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, insulin promotes translocation of the α-2 and β-1 subunits to the plasma membranes (9Marette A. Krischer J. Lavoie L. Ackerley C. Carpentier J.-L. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1716-C1722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hundal H.S. Marette A. Mitsumoto Y. Ramlal T. Blostein R. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5040-5043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exact molecular mechanism by which insulin regulates Na+/K+ pump activity in these cell types is unclear. In view of the recent reports that Na+/K+-ATPase activity can be regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanisms, we have examined potential roles of serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1 (PP-1) and PP-2A in the mechanism of insulin activation of Na+/K+-ATPase in cultured L6 rat skeletal muscle cells by using two complementary approaches. In the first approach, L6 cells were pretreated with okadaic acid or calyculin A, two cell-permeable inhibitors of PP-1 and PP-2A, followed by insulin treatment and assay of Na+/K+-ATPase activity in plasma membranes. In the second approach, cellular levels of the glycogen/SR-associated regulatory subunit of PP-1 (PP-1G) were altered by gene transfer techniques to stimulate PP-1 catalytic activity, and the effect of PP-1G overexpression on insulin-stimulated Na+/K+-ATPase activity was examined. The premise for these studies is our recent finding that overexpression of PP-1G increases cellular responsiveness to insulin via the activation of PP-1 catalytic function (11Ragolia L. Begum N. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2398-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that if PP-1 is indeed involved in insulin activation of Na+/K+-ATPase, then increasing the catalytic activity of PP-1 via its regulatory subunit should increase the activation of Na+/K+-ATPase by enhancing dephosphorylation of the α subunit. The results presented in this study indicate that dephosphorylation of the α subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase by insulin-stimulated PP-1 may be one of the mechanisms by which insulin regulates the activation of the Na+/K+ pump in L6 cells. Cell culture reagents, fetal bovine serum, LipofectAMINETM, calyculin A (caly-A), G418, phosphorylaseb, phosphorylase kinase, and antibiotics were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity ≥ 3000 Ci/mmol), [32P]orthophosphoric acid, and 125I-protein A were purchased from DuPont NEN. Electrophoresis and protein assay reagents were from Bio-Rad. Okadaic acid was from Moana Bioproducts (Honolulu, HI). Ouabain, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, ATP, NADH, phospho(enol)pyruvate, and all other reagents were from Sigma. Monoclonal antibodies against α-1 (McK1) and α-2 (McB2) subunits of Na+/K+-ATPase were kindly given by Dr. Kathleen Sweadner (Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA). Porcine insulin was a kind gift from Eli Lilly Co. (Indianapolis, IN). The Lac SwitchTM inducible mammalian expression system vector pOPI3 was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Spontaneously fusing L6 rat skeletal muscle cells (a kind gift from Dr. Amira Klip, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada) were seeded in 100-mm dishes at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml and maintained in α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic mixture in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C as described previously (12Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12514-12520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Completely differentiated myotubes were used for all experiments after a 16–18-h starvation in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Stable L6 cell lines overexpressing PP-1G were generated by transfection of L6 myoblasts with PP-1G cDNA using an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible mammalian expression vector as detailed in our recent publication (11Ragolia L. Begum N. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2398-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed on myotubes after a 40-h induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Neo control represents transfection with an empty expression vector. As detailed in our recent publication (11Ragolia L. Begum N. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2398-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), transfection per se did not affect the extent of differentiation of L6 cells as monitored by analysis of myogenin protein and cell morphology. Serum-starved myotubes were fed with serum-free medium containing 5 mm glucose and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h before treatment with insulin or other agents. Identical dishes were pulsed with insulin (0.1–1000 nm) for 0–30 min. In some experiments, to evaluate the effects of phosphatase inhibitors on Na+/K+-ATPase enzymatic activity, the cells were preincubated with okadaic acid (0.1–1000 nm), caly-A (1 μm), or tautomycin (3 nm) for 30 min, followed by the addition of insulin (100 nm) for 15 min. At the end of the incubation period, the medium was removed, and the cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold PBS and finally scraped off the dishes in 1–2 ml of ice-cold isolation buffer containing 15 mm Tris base; 5 mm EGTA; 300 mmd-mannitol, pH 7.0, with 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, antipain, and soybean trypsin inhibitor; 1 mm benzamidine; and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were sonicated for 10 s and centrifuged at 8000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min to pellet the membrane fraction (13Ohara T. Sussman K.E. Draznin B. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 1560-1563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crude plasma membranes were reconstituted in 200 μl of ATPase assay buffer containing 100 mmimidazole, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mmNH4Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm sodium azide, and a mixture of the protease inhibitors indicated above. Aliquots of membrane preparations were used for the assay of proteins and Na+/K+-ATPase activity. Unless otherwise stated, all enzymatic assays were performed immediately after the isolation of membrane fractions. Enzyme activity was measured by monitoring the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP using the coupled assay of Barnett (14Barnett R.E. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4644-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Oxidation of NADH to NAD+ was followed on a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 340 nm. Specific Na+/K+-ATPase activity was taken as a difference in activity in the absence and presence of 1 mmouabain. At this concentration, ouabain inhibits the α subunits of the enzyme. Results of enzyme activity are expressed as μmol of NADH converted to NAD+/mg of protein/h. Differentiated L6 cells in 100-mm dishes were serum-starved overnight for 16–18 h. The next day the medium was removed and replaced with 4 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for an additional 1 h. [32P]Orthophosphate (1 mCi/dish) was added, and the cells were incubated for 4 h and then exposed to OA (final concentration, 10 nm, to inhibit PP-2A) or caly-A (1 μm, to inhibit PP-1 and PP-2A) for 30 min. Insulin (100 nm) was added for 15 min. The cells were rinsed four times with ice-cold PBS containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors and harvested. Crude plasma membranes were prepared as described above and dissolved in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mmtriethanolamine, pH 7.2; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 0.5 mm EGTA; 2 mm sodium vanadate; 100 mm sodium pyrophosphate; 100 mm sodium fluoride; 40 mm β-glycerophosphate; 1 mmbenzamidine; 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A, antipain, and soybean trypsin inhibitor; 100 mm NaCl; and 1% Triton X-100. The cell membrane lysates (100 μg of protein) from above were precleared by incubation with mouse IgG (5 μg/ml coupled to anti-mouse IgG agarose at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-α-1 Na+/K+-ATPase antibodies precoupled to anti-mouse IgG agarose at room temperature for 1 h. The pellets were washed four times with lysis buffer and resuspended in 30 μl of 2 × LSB. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min followed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 30 s) to pellet down the agarose beads. Electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitates was performed in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). The protein contents of the α subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase were determined by immunoprecipitating unlabeled plasma membranes with the antibodies as described above followed by separation of the immunoprecipitates on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After transferring the proteins to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, the blots were probed with α-1 subunit antibody (16Urayama O. Shutt H. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8271-8280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of PP-1G and the assay of PP-1 catalytic activity in the immunoprecipitates were performed as described earlier (11Ragolia L. Begum N. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2398-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12514-12520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 32P-labeled glycogen phosphorylase a as a substrate (12Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12514-12520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein contents in the cell extracts were determined by the bicinchoninic acid (17Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fugimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar). Student's t test or analysis of variance was used to evaluate the significance of the effects of insulin and phosphatase inhibitors on enzyme activity. In the initial series of experiments, we studied the kinetics and insulin dose-response of Na+/K+-ATPase activity using the enzymatic assay described under “Materials and Methods.” In L6 cell membrane preparations, ouabain-sensitive Na+/K+-ATPase activity represents ≈40% of total ATPase activity. Acute exposure of L6 myotubes to 100 nm insulin for 15 min resulted in an approximate 2-fold stimulation of ouabain-sensitive Na+/K+-ATPase activity over the basal values (insulin versus basal values, 104.6 ± 6.6 versus 53.1 ± 4.83 μmol of NAD+ formed/mg protein/h, respectively). Insulin treatment did not affect ouabain-resistant enzyme activity. Kinetic studies indicate that the half-maximal insulin effect was observed within 5 min of insulin addition, with a peak activation at 15 min with 100 nm insulin (Fig. 1). The effect of insulin on pump activation was transient, returning to basal values at 30 min. The stimulation of Na+/K+-ATPase activity by insulin was concentration dependent with an EC50 of <1 nminsulin, and a maximum effect was seen at a concentration of 100 nm insulin (Fig. 2).Figure 2Dose-response of insulin on Na+/K+-ATPase activity. Cells were exposed to varying concentrations of insulin for 15 min, followed by an enzyme assay. Results are the mean of two different experiments, each performed on duplicate dishes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To understand the mechanism of insulin's effect on pump activation, we used specific, cell-permeable inhibitors of serine/threonine protein phosphatases. Preincubation of L6 cells with okadaic acid (1 μm), caly-A (1 μm), or tautomycin (3 nm) for 30 min followed by insulin treatment for 15 min caused a greater than 85% inhibition of insulin's effect on Na+/K+-ATPase activation (Fig.3). The addition of phosphatase inhibitors 5 min after insulin treatment and a further incubation for 15 min completely reversed insulin's effect on pump activity (Fig. 3;p < 0.05) and decreased the enzyme activity below control levels. OA and caly-A alone caused ≈20% decrease in basal Na+/K+-ATPase activity. Dose-response analysis of OA on Na+/K+-ATPase activation revealed that pretreatment of cells with low concentrations of OA (0.1–10 nm), which are known to specifically inhibit PP-2A (12Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12514-12520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Cohen P. Klumpp S. Schelling D.L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 19Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (280) Google Scholar), did not affect insulin's stimulation of pump activity in L6 cells (Fig. 4). As the concentration of OA was increased to concentrations that inhibit both PP-1 and PP-2A, there was a reduction in insulin's effect on Na+/K+-ATPase. At a concentration of 1 μm that is known to inhibit both PP-1 and PP-2A, OA blocked insulin-stimulated Na+/K+-ATPase activity by 80% (Fig. 4). This data further confirms the results shown in Fig. 3 with tautomycin, another cell-permeable phosphatase inhibitor that completely inhibits PP-1 at low concentrations (3 nm) without affecting PP-2A activity (19Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (280) Google Scholar). To examine whether insulin activation of Na+/K+-ATPase is due to dephosphorylation of the α subunit, L6 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, treated with or without caly-A (1 μm) or OA (10 nm) for 30 min, and then treated with insulin for 15 min. Equal amounts of precleared cell lysates (100 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody directed against the α-1 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase (the predominant isoform present in L6 cells; see Ref. 2Ewart E.H. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C295-C311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography. As seen in Fig. 5 A, the immunoprecipitated α subunit contained 32P in the basal state (Fig. 5 A, lane 1). Insulin treatment decreased the amount of 32P in the 110-kDa α-1 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase when compared with that of controls (Fig. 5 A, compare lane 2 versus lane 1). Pretreatment with caly-A (1 μm) prevented insulin-induced decreases in phosphorylation (Fig. 5 A, lane 3), whereas low concentrations of OA were ineffective in blocking insulin-induced dephosphorylation (compare lane 4 versus lane 2). The insulin-induced decrease in the phosphorylation status of the α-1 subunit seen in Fig. 5 A was not due to variations in the amount of α-1 subunit protein immunoprecipitated from insulin-treated samples (Fig. 5 B). Quantitation of the extent of phosphorylation of the α subunit by densitometric analyses of the autoradiograms from different experiments after normalization for α-1 subunit proteins revealed a 60% decrease in phosphorylation status of the 110-kDa α-1 subunit in insulin-treated cells when compared with that of controls (Fig. 5 C). Pretreatment with caly-A prevented insulin-mediated reductions in α-1 subunit phosphorylation and caused an increase in the phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit above the basal levels. In contrast, low concentrations of OA did not effectively prevent insulin-stimulated dephosphorylation. The results of the metabolic labeling studies of the α subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase along with the results on the effect of the phosphatase inhibitors implied that insulin's effect on dephosphorylation and/or activation of Na+/K+-ATPase α subunit may be mediated via an activated protein phosphatase. This observation together with our recent studies that treatment of L6 cells with insulin results in a rapid activation of a particulate form of protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1, which is similar to glycogen/SR-associated PP-1 (PP-1G) present in skeletal muscle; Ref. 20Dent P. Lavoinne A. Nakielny S. Caudwell F.B. Watt P. Cohen P. Nature. 1991; 348: 302-308Crossref Scopus (404) Google Scholar) led us to examine the exact role of PP-1 in insulin-mediated dephosphorylation and activation of Na+/K+-ATPase. For this, we used the recently generated L6 cell lines (clones S29 and S34 that overexpress the glycogen/SR-associated regulatory subunit of PP-1, PP-1G). As detailed in our recent publication (11Ragolia L. Begum N. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2398-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), overexpression of PP-1G did not alter cell growth or morphology but resulted in a small increase in basal PP-1 activity and a >2-fold increase in insulin-stimulated PP-1 catalytic activity when compared with wild-type L6 cells and neo controls carrying an empty expression vector. This increase in PP-1 activity was accompanied by a 30% increase in the basal Na+/K+-ATPase activity (when compared with wild-type L6 cells and neo controls) and a 2-fold increase in insulin-stimulated ouabain-sensitive Na+/K+-ATPase activity (Fig.6). Ouabain-resistant Na+/K+-ATPase activity was not affected by overexpression of PP-1G (data not shown). To gain insight into the intracellular upstream signaling components that mediate insulin's effect on PP-1 and Na+/K+-ATPase activation, we pretreated L6 cells with wortmannin, a selective and potent inhibitor of PI3 kinase. Pretreatment with wortmannin blocked insulin's effects on PP-1 activation (Fig. 7 A) and prevented Na+/K+-ATPase stimulation by insulin (Fig. 7 B) as well as dephosphorylation of its α subunit (Fig. 7 B, inset). Wortmannin alone did not affect the basal activities of PP-1 or Na+/K+-ATPase. In contrast, rapamycin, a p70S6Kinase inhibitor at a concentration of 20 ng/ml did not block insulin's effect on PP-1 activation and Na+/K+-ATPase activity (data not shown). The results presented in this study indicate that the acute stimulatory effects of insulin on Na+/K+-ATPase activity are mediated by the dephosphorylation of its catalytic α subunit. The activation mechanism observed in the present study is in addition to the previously reported effects of insulin on the K0.5Na+ and V max of the α-1 and α-2 isoforms, respectively, in adipocytes and the subcellular redistribution of the enzyme in skeletal muscle cells (7Bertorello A.M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 5040-5043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of insulin on the dephosphorylation and activation of the α subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase seem to be mediated via the activation of PP-1. This is supported by the kinetics of insulin-activated Na+/K+-ATPase and PP-1, insulin dose-response data, the inhibition of insulin's effect on pump activity by high concentrations of OA and caly-A, and, most importantly, the absence of inhibition by low concentrations of OA, which specifically inhibit PP-2A (18Cohen P. Klumpp S. Schelling D.L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 19Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Thus, these results provide evidence that Na+/K+-ATPase catalytic activity is regulated by insulin in vivo via a complex dephosphorylation/phosphorylation mechanism involving PP-1 activation and presumably inactivation of protein kinase A. Recent work by a number of laboratories using a variety of cell types has shown that phosphorylation of the Na+/K+-ATPase α subunit by agonists or hormones that elevate protein kinase A, PKC, phospholipase A2, and intracellular calcium will all inhibit its catalytic activity (21Bertorello A.M. Katz A.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F743-F755PubMed Google Scholar, 22Satoh T. Cohen H.T. Katz A.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1496-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 23Li D. Aperia A. Celsi G. da Cruz e Silva E.F. Greengard P. Meister B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F673-F680PubMed Google Scholar). However, the inhibition observed by these agonists seems to be cell type specific. Thus, PKC activation results in an elevation of pump activity in rat primary skeletal muscle cells (2Ewart E.H. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C295-C311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, studies with purified preparations of Na+/K+-ATPase α subunit have shown that incubation with protein kinase A or PKC results in phosphorylation and inactivation of the enzyme (6Oguchi A. Ikeda U. Kanbe T. Tsuruya Y. Yamamoto K. Kawakami K. Medford R.M. Shimada K. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1167-H1172PubMed Google Scholar). In support of our observations on the inhibitory effects of PP-1 inhibitors on insulin-stimulated Na+/K+-ATPase, studies by Liet al. (23Li D. Aperia A. Celsi G. da Cruz e Silva E.F. Greengard P. Meister B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F673-F680PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated an inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase by phosphatase inhibitors and fenoldopam, a D1 receptor agonist in rat renal tubules. These authors suggest that inhibition of PP-1 via DARPP32 (the endogenous phosphatase inhibitor, analogous to inhibitor 1) may be one of the mechanisms by which dopamine inhibits the pump activity of Na+/K+-ATPase (23Li D. Aperia A. Celsi G. da Cruz e Silva E.F. Greengard P. Meister B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F673-F680PubMed Google Scholar, 24Aperia A.J. Fryckstedt J. Svensson L.-B. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2798-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Further support for a role for PP-1 in insulin-mediated activation of the Na+/K+-ATPase pump is provided by our studies with two L6 clonal cell lines that overexpress the regulatory subunit of PP-1, PP-1G (11Ragolia L. Begum N. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2398-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As detailed in our earlier studies (12Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12514-12520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), insulin stimulates the glycogen/SR-bound PP-1 in L6 cells without affecting the other forms of phosphatases. Overexpression of PP-1G resulted in a small but significant increase in the basal activity of PP-1 as well as basal Na+/K+-ATPase catalytic activity. Insulin treatment of L6 cells overexpressing PP-1G exhibited a >2-fold increase in ouabain-sensitive Na+/K+-ATPase catalytic activity when compared with neo controls and wild-type L6 cells. This increase in catalytic activity parallels a 2–3-fold increase observed in insulin-stimulated PP-1 activity. Furthermore, the kinetics of PP-1 activation by insulin (see Ref. 12Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12514-12520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) precedes the kinetics of Na+/K+-ATPase pump activation. These observations are further strengthened by the fact that insulin specifically activates PP-1 and simultaneously inhibits PP-2A activity in L6 cells (12Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12514-12520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and low concentrations of OA fail to block insulin-stimulated pump activation. Agents that cause PP-1 activation also cause stimulation of Na+/K+-ATPase activity. We have recently shown that acute stimulation of L6 cells with TPA, a PKC activator, results in PP-1 activation and that the effects of insulin and TPA on PP-1 activation were not additive, suggesting a common mechanism via PKC activation (25Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16662-16667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, down-regulation of PKC by chronic treatment with TPA, as well as inhibition of PKC with synthetic inhibitors, blocks insulin-stimulated PP-1 activation (25Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16662-16667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although we did not measure Na+/K+-ATPase activity in TPA-treated L6 cells, recent studies with primary cultures of rat skeletal muscle have demonstrated an activation of ouabain-sensitive Na+/K+-ATPase by TPA and insulin (26Sampson S.R. Brodie C. Alboim S.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C751-C758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and these effects could be reduced by the inhibition or down-regulation of PKC. Thus, it seems that PP-1 not only plays a major role in glycogen synthesis but also has a role in the regulation of ion channels. These studies provide a new mechanism for the in vivo hormonal regulation of intracellular Na+ and K+homeostasis, cell volume, and resting membrane potential in skeletal muscle. We have previously reported that insulin resistance induced by elevations in intracellular calcium, as well as streptozoticin diabetes, is accompanied by inhibition of PP-1 activities in adipocytes and skeletal muscle (27Begum N. Sussman K.E. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5959-5963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Begum N. Sussman K.E. Draznin B.

Excerpta Medica, International Congress Series 980. Elsevier Publishers, 1991: 225-245Google Scholar). Interestingly, both of these conditions were accompanied by reductions in Na+/K+-ATPase activity in adipocytes, skeletal muscle, and aortic tissue (13Ohara T. Sussman K.E. Draznin B. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 1560-1563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,29Draznin B. Reusch J. Begum N. Sussman K.E. Byyny R. Ohara T. Smith U. Bruun N.E. Hedner T. Hökfelt B.

This lends further support to the observation that inhibition of PP-1 results in impaired activation of Na+/K+-ATPase, and this defect may contribute to the early muscle fatigue associated with diabetic complications such as neuropathy. In intact skeletal muscle, Na+/K+-ATPase units have been found to be present in either latent or intracellular storage pools (2Ewart E.H. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C295-C311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin is known to increase the number of Na+/K+-ATPase units on the plasma membrane in skeletal muscle but not in adipose tissue (2Ewart E.H. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C295-C311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Marette A. Krischer J. Lavoie L. Ackerley C. Carpentier J.-L. Klip A. Am. J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 5040-5043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is presently not known whether PP-1 plays a role in insulin regulation of subcellular distribution of Na+/K+-ATPase by promoting reinsertion into the plasma membrane and/or increasing its pumping efficiency. Additional studies are warranted to understand the role of PP-1 in insulin-mediated translocation of Na+/K+-ATPase from the intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane. To examine the upstream insulin signaling components that mediate insulin's effect on PP-1 as well as Na+/K+-ATPase activation, we pretreated L6 cells with nanomolar concentrations of wortmannin, a selective inhibitor of PI3 kinase (33Okada T. Sakuma L. Fukui Y. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3563-3567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This inhibitor not only blocked the activation of PP-1 by insulin but also prevented insulin's effects on Na+/K+-ATPase pump dephosphorylation and therefore blocked activation. Thus it seems that insulin signaling via a PI3 kinase pathway stimulates PP-1, presumably by activating PKC and/or protein kinase B (c-Akt) (the downstream target of PI3 kinase), which in turn may increase phosphorylation of PP-1G, leading to activation of PP-1. Earlier studies from this laboratory have shown that insulin- as well as TPA-mediated activation of PP-1 was accompanied by phosphorylation of PP-1G and also that insulin-mediated PP-1G phosphorylation/activation could be prevented by inhibitors of PKC (25Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16662-16667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, recent studies have demonstrated a role for PKB (c-Akt) in insulin-mediated inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3. It is not known presently whether or not PKB (c-Akt) is the upstream activator of PP-1. In summary, the results of the present studies indicate that acute regulation of Na+/K+-ATPase by insulin in cultured skeletal muscle cells is mediated by dephosphorylation of the α subunit via an activated PP-1G. Activation of PP-1G and Na+/K+-ATPase by insulin is dependent in part upon PI3 kinase-generated signals. We thank Dr. Amira Klip for helpful suggestions in the preparation of this manuscript."

These results show that sequences carboxyl-terminal to apoB95 (amino acids 4331–4536) are not absolutely required for Lp(a) formation, but this segment of the apoB molecule, particularly residues 4331–4397, is necessary for the efficient assembly of Lp(a).

Why Lp(a) promotes atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease is not fully known, although several possible mechanisms have been suggested in recent years (for reviews, see Refs. 1Scanu A.M.

The structural features of apoB that allow it to form a disulfide linkage with apo(a) are only partially understood (11Trieu V.N. McConathy W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15471-15474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that the carboxyl-terminal cysteine of apoB100, cysteine 4326, is required for Lp(a) formation (12McCormick S.P.A. Peterson K.R. Hammer R.E. Clegg C.H. Young S.G. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1996; 6: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 13McCormick S.P.A. Ng J.K. Taylor S. Flynn L.M. Hammer R.E. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23914-23917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), almost certainly because it is the site of attachment for apo(a). However, it is obvious that other features of the apoB molecule, aside from a single free cysteine residue, must play a role in the binding of apoB and apo(a). It seems likely that an initial noncovalent interaction brings the two molecules into close proximity so that the disulfide bond can form (11Trieu V.N. McConathy W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15471-15474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to define the sequences, aside from the critical free cysteine residue, that are important for apoB's interaction with apo(a). The simplest hypothesis regarding the noncovalent interaction event would be that apo(a) binds to apoB sequences near the critical free cysteine residue, cysteine 4326. In considering this hypothesis, we examined the amino acid sequences surrounding residue 4326, both for human and mouse apoB. The mouse apoB sequence was examined because there is some evidence that mouse apoB can bind to apo(a) noncovalently (19Chiesa G. Hobbs H.H. Koschinsky M.L. Lawn R.M. Maika S.D. Hammer R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24369-24374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although it lacks a cysteine at residue 4326 (13McCormick S.P.A. Ng J.K. Taylor S. Flynn L.M. Hammer R.E. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10147-10151Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and therefore cannot form bona fide Lp(a). Interestingly, although the 50 amino acids carboxyl-terminal from cysteine 4326 are reasonably well conserved (66% identical) between the human and mouse sequences, the 50 amino acids amino-terminal to residue 4326 are poorly conserved (34% identical). These observations led us to hypothesize that the sequences carboxyl-terminal from cysteine 4326 might play a role in Lp(a) assembly. To test the hypothesis that sequences carboxyl-terminal to cysteine 4326 might facilitate the interaction between apo(a) and apoB, we generated transgenic mice expressing two truncated forms of human apoB, apoB95 (4330 amino acids), and apoB97 (4397 amino acids). We then compared the abilities of apoB95, apoB97, and apoB100 to bind covalently to apo(a) and form Lp(a). These studies provided new insights into the apoB sequences that are required for the interaction of apoB and apo(a). To generate constructs coding for apoB95 (4330 amino acids) and apoB97 (4397 amino acids), we used “pop-in, pop-out” gene targeting (13McCormick S.P.A. Ng J.K. Taylor S. Flynn L.M. Hammer R.E.

Ng J.K. Taylor S. Flynn L.M. Hammer R.E. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10147-10151Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The gene-targeting vectors were generated by introducing nonsense mutations into a 2.8-kb XbaI fragment from the apoB gene (from intron 28 to just past the end of the exon 29 coding sequences) that had been cloned into theURA3-containing yeast integrating vector (pRS406, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (13McCormick S.P.A. Ng J.K. Taylor S. Flynn L.M. Hammer R.E. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10147-10151Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To generate the targeting vectors, we introduced subtle mutations into exon 29 of the apoB gene using the Excite polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. For the apoB95 gene-targeting vector, we used oligonucleotide B95 (5′-CCTTAATCTTCAc T AGTTCAATGAAT-3′); for the apoB97 gene-targeting vector, we used oligonucleotide (5′-GGACTTCCATTCTGAATA A ATTGTCAagGCCTCTAACTTTACTTCC-3′). In each oligonucleotide, the boldface and italic nucleotide introduced a nonsense mutation. Additional nucleotide substitutions (shown in lowercase) were introduced to create new restriction sites (SpeI for the apoB95 mutation and StuI for the apoB97 mutation). Mutagenesis reactions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Both gene-targeting vectors were linearized at a uniqueEcoRI site in exon 29 and transformed into yeast spheroplasts harboring the 108-kb human apoB YAC. Transformants were selected initially on plates lacking uracil and later on plates lacking uracil, tryptophan, and lysine. Transformants in which the gene-targeting vector had integrated correctly into exon 29 of the apoB YAC (the “pop-in” step) were identified by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and PCR analysis (see below). For the “pop-out” step, targeted transformants were grown in medium lacking lysine and tryptophan and subsequently plated onto 5-fluoroorotic acid-containing plates (17Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Colonies were then plated onto plates lacking lysine and tryptophan, and correctly targeted pop-out clones were identified by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and PCR analysis. To analyze gene-targeting events at both the pop-in and pop-out steps, high molecular weight DNA (18Peterson K.R. Clegg C.H. Huxley C. Josephson B.M. Haugen H.S. Furukawa T. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The YAC bands were visualized after staining with ethidium bromide. To confirm the introduction of the apoB95 nonsense mutation into the YAC, targeted YAC clones were identified by enzymatically amplifying a 354-base pair (bp) fragment of exon 29 (apoB cDNA nucleotides 13,067–13,421) with PCR primers 5′-CATTAAACAGCTGAAAGAGATGA-3′ and 5′-GTTAGAGGCACTGACAATATATTC-3′. The PCR product was cleaved withSpeI and analyzed on an ethidium bromide-stained 2% agarose gel. Cleavage of the mutant apoB 354-bp DNA fragment withSpeI yields 222- and 132-bp fragments. To confirm the introduction of the apoB97 mutation, a 480-bp fragment of exon 29 (apoB cDNA nucleotides 13,295–13,775) was amplified with PCR primers 5′-GATCCAAGTATAGTTGGCTGG-3′ and 5′-GTTCATGACTGTGGTTGATTGC-3′. The PCR product was cleaved with StuI and analyzed on an ethidium bromide-stained 2% agarose gel. Cleavage of the mutant apoB 480-bp DNA fragment with StuI yields 362- and 118-bp fragments.

Recombinant human apo(a) from transgenic mouse plasma (3.0 μl) was incubated with samples of wild-type and mutant forms of human apoB contained in transgenic mouse plasma. Incubations were performed in 0.15 m NaCl in a total volume of 40 μl for 4 h at 37 °C. Each incubation contained an identical amount of apoB, as judged by a monoclonal antibody-based human apoB RIA. Samples (5 μl) were removed from the incubations after 10, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min and subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-4% polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions. The separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot analysis with the human apo(a)-specific antibody IgG-a5 (24Marcovina S.M. Albers J.J. Gabel B. Koschinsky M.L.

Lp(a) formation was also assessed with a specific “sandwich” RIA using 96-well polyvinylchloride plates, as described previously. The human apoB95 and human apoB97 transgenic mice were bred with mice that were hemizygous for a human apo(a) transgene (19Chiesa G. Hobbs H.H. Koschinsky M.L. Lawn R.M. Maika S.D. Hammer R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24369-24374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The offspring were screened for apoB expression by Western blot analysis with monoclonal antibody 1D1. To identify mice expressing human apo(a) and to document the amount of apo(a) that was covalently linked to apoB, Western blots of nonreduced SDS-4% polyacrylamide gels were performed with apo(a)-specific monoclonal antibody IgG-a5. To assess the importance of the carboxyl terminus of apoB in Lp(a) formation, we compared the ability of apoB95 and apoB97 to bind to apo(a) and form Lp(a). The apoB95 and apoB97 nonsense mutations were introduced into exon 29 of the apoB gene by pop-in, pop-out gene targeting in a 108-kb YAC containing the entire human apoB gene (Fig.1). After the pop-in step, the size of the YAC increased to 115 kb, reflecting integration of the 7-kb gene-targeting vector (Fig.2 A, lanes 2 and3). To document that the apoB95 mutation had been retained within the pop-in YAC, we enzymatically amplified a segment of the apoB gene flanking the apoB95 nonsense mutation and then cleaved the amplified DNA with SpeI (Fig. 2 B, lane 2); for the apoB97 experiments, the PCR product was cleaved withStuI (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). The gene-targeting process was completed by growing yeast harboring the apoB95 and apoB97 pop-in YACs in 5-fluoroorotic acid, which selects for growth of clones that had lost the URA3 gene through an intrachromosomal recombination event. After this pop-out step, the apoB95 and apoB97 YACs returned to the original size of 108 kb (Fig.2 A, lanes 4 and 5). Retention of the targeted mutations after the pop-out step was documented by digesting enzymatically amplified fragments of exon 29 DNA with eitherSpeI or StuI (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5 and 6). The overall efficiencies for both the pop-in and pop-out steps were high. Approximately 30% of the pop-in colonies were appropriately targeted and contained a single integrated vector. Most of the other colonies had two or three copies of the gene-targeting vector. Approximately 25% of the pop-out colonies had undergone the predicted intrachromosomal gene-targeting event and retained the targeted mutation.Figure 2Analysis of YAC gene-targeting events on pulsed field agarose gels and by PCR.

Eleven of 58 newborn pups expressed apoB95, and 4 of 46 pups expressed apoB97. The founders expressing the highest levels of apoB were bred with C57BL/6 mice to establish transgenic lines. Fig.3 shows apoB95 and apoB97 in the plasma of founder mice. The plasma of the apoB95 and apoB97 transgenic mice contained elevated levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the low density lipoprotein fraction, as judged by FPLC fractionation studies (20Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Chiesa G. Grass D.S. Chin P. Hammer R.E. Hobbs H.H. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) (data not shown). To test the ability of apoB95 and apoB97 to bind covalently to apo(a) and form Lp(a), plasma samples from these mice were incubated with apo(a), and the incubation mixtures were analyzed by Western blots of SDS-polyacrylamide gels with an apo(a)-specific monoclonal antibody (Fig. 4). Lp(a) is easily distinguished from apo(a) by Western blot analysis because the covalently bound apoB-apo(a) complex is much larger and migrates more slowly on SDS-4% polyacrylamide gels. These experiments revealed that Lp(a) formation was detectable with both apoB95 and apoB97; however, a relatively small amount of Lp(a) was formed with apoB95, suggesting that Lp(a) assembly with apoB95 was less efficient than with apoB100. To explore Lp(a) formation with apoB95, apoB97, and apoB100 further, we used the same Western blot assay to examine the kinetics of Lp(a) formation. In these experiments, apoB95, apoB97, wild-type apoB100, and a mutant apoB100 (C4326G) lacking the site of attachment for apo(a) (Fig. 5 A) were incubated with apo(a), and the formation of Lp(a) was assessed at 10, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min. Each of the incubation mixtures contained an identical amount of apoB, as judged by a monoclonal antibody-based RIA (Fig.5 B). With wild-type human apoB100, Lp(a) formation was evident by 10 min, and by 30 min, all of the apo(a) was covalently bound to apoB100 (Fig. 5 A, lane 2). As expected, no Lp(a) was formed with the mutant apoB100 (C4326G) (Fig.5 A, lane 3). With apoB95, there was no evidence of Lp(a) formation at 10 or 30 min, and only trace amounts were observed at 60 min. Even after 120 and 240 min, large amounts of free apo(a) were still present (Fig. 5 A, lane 4). ApoB97 formed Lp(a) more rapidly than apoB95, with clear cut Lp(a) formation after 10 min. However, the Western blots suggested that apoB97 might form Lp(a) less efficiently than apoB100, in that small amounts of free apo(a) could be detected at the later time points (Fig.5 A, lane 5). To further analyze whether apoB97 and apoB100 truly differed in their efficiency of interacting with apo(a) and forming Lp(a), we used a solid-phase RIA to assess the kinetics of Lp(a) formation. In these experiments, equal amounts of apo(a) and apoB were incubated for 10–240 min, as described above, and then placed in wells of 96-well polyvinylchloride plates coated with an apo(a)-specific monoclonal antibody, LPA-6. The plates were washed, and the amount of Lp(a) formation was judged by the binding of a 125I-labeled monoclonal antibody, C1.4, that is specific for the amino-terminal portion of the apoB molecule (26Krul E.S. Kleinman Y. Kinoshita M. Pfleger B. Oida K. Law A. Scott J. Pease R. Schonfeld G. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 937-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6, this RIA provided further evidence that Lp(a) formation was slower with apoB97 than with the wild-type apoB100. Once again, the amount of apoB97 and apoB100 added to the RIA wells was identical (Fig. 5 B). To test the ability of the apoB95 and apoB97 variants to form Lp(a)in vivo, we examined Lp(a) formation in mice expressing human apo(a) and either apoB95 or apoB97. In previously published experiments (20Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Chiesa G. Grass D.S. Chin P. Hammer R.E. Hobbs H.H. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 21McCormick S.P.A. Linton M.F. Hobbs H.H. Taylor S. Curtiss L.K. Young S.G. J. Biol.

In mice expressing both apo(a) and apoB100, all of the apo(a) in the plasma was covalently complexed to apoB in the form of Lp(a) (20Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Chiesa G. Grass D.S. Chin P. Hammer R.E. Hobbs H.H. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), whereas all of the apo(a) circulated freely in mice expressing both apo(a) and apoB90 (21McCormick S.P.A. Linton M.F. Hobbs H.H. Taylor S. Curtiss L.K. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24284-24289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the current experiments, we mated the human apo(a) transgenic mice with mice expressing high levels (∼50 mg/dl) of either apoB95 or apoB97. Offspring from these matings were screened for human apoB and apo(a) by Western blot analysis. Transgenic mice expressing both apo(a) and apoB95 (Fig. 7 A, lanes 4, 8, and 9) had only a very small amount of Lp(a) in their plasma, and most of the apo(a) in the plasma was free. In contrast, mice expressing both apo(a) and apoB-97 (Fig.7 B, lanes 3 and 8) had large amounts of Lp(a) in their plasma and virtually no free apo(a). We have been interested in defining the structure of Lp(a), with an emphasis on defining the structural features of apoB that are required for its interaction with apo(a). Our earlier site-directed mutagenesis experiments (13McCormick S.P.A. Ng J.K. Taylor S. Flynn L.M. Hammer R.E. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10147-10151Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and those of Callow and Rubin (14Callow M.J. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23914-23917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal cysteine of apoB, cysteine 4326, is the site of attachment for apo(a). Although the latter studies represented a significant step forward in understanding Lp(a) structure, it is plain that other features of the apoB molecule, aside from a single free cysteine residue, must be important for apoB's interaction with apo(a). It is generally assumed that Lp(a) assembly involves an initial noncovalent interaction between apo(a) and apoB, which brings the two molecules together so that a disulfide bond can form (11Trieu V.N. McConathy W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15471-15474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, there has been a paucity of data regarding the apoB sequences that are important for facilitating the formation of the disulfide bond. In this study, we sought to approach that issue by examining the interaction between apo(a) and two truncated apoB's, apoB95 and apoB97. ApoB95 contains cysteine 4326, followed by four additional residues (for a total of 4330 amino acids). ApoB97 contained the amino-terminal 4397 amino acids of apoB100. The ability of the two different truncated apoB molecules to interact with apo(a) was assessed by monitoring the rate of the disulfide linkage between the two molecules. Interestingly, apoB95 formed bona fide, disulfide-linked Lp(a), although the efficiency of Lp(a) formation was quite poor, as judged both by in vitro assays of Lp(a) assembly and by the analysis of transgenic mice expressing both apo(a) and apoB95. These studies demonstrated that the residues carboxyl-terminal to the last amino acid of apoB95 (amino acids 4331–4536) are not absolutely required for the Lp(a) assembly but contribute significantly to the efficiency of Lp(a) formation. Lp(a) assembly with apoB97 (4397 amino acids) was very robust when compared with apoB95 and only slightly less efficient than with apoB100. The observation that lysine analogues (e.g., ε-amino-n-caproic acid) can block the formation of Lp(a)in vitro (19Chiesa G. Hobbs H.H. Koschinsky M.L. Lawn R.M. Maika S.D. Hammer R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24369-24374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has led many to assume that lysine residues must be involved in the initial noncovalent interaction between apoB100 and apo(a). ε-Amino-n-caproic acid binds to the lysine-binding site of plasminogen kringle 4 (27Wu T.-P. Padmanabhan K. Tulinsky A. Mulichak A.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10589-10594Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and it presumably abrogates Lp(a) formation by binding to the analogous site on apo(a). There is little doubt that apo(a) can bind to lysine, since Lp(a) can actually be purified by taking advantage of apo(a)'s ability to bind to lysine-Sepharose affinity columns (28Eaton D.L. Fless G.M. Kohr W.J. McLean J.W. Xu Q.-T. Miller C.G. Lawn R.M. Scanu A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3224-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 29Karàdi I. Kostner G.M. Gries A. Nimpf J. Romics L. Malle E. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 960: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Apo(a)'s lysine-binding properties led us to hypothesize that apo(a) initially interacts with apoB lysine residues near the site of attachment for apo(a), apoB cysteine 4326. To assess the plausibility of that hypothesis, we used the computer program LOCATE (30Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Garber D.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1674-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) to predict the structure of the amino acids surrounding apoB cysteine 4326. Interestingly, apoB amino acid residues 4315–4338 are predicted to form a class A amphipathic α-helix with high lipid affinity (Fig.8, A and B). Within this α-helix, the side chains of cysteine 4326 and three lysine residues (residues 4319, 4322, and 4331) project into the aqueous phase, while the side chains of many hydrophobic residues are buried within the lipid phase. When one looks “down the barrel” of this α-helix (Fig. 8 A), lysine 4322 and lysine 4319 flank cysteine 4326. As illustrated in the helical net diagram of the α-helix (Fig. 8 B), lysine 4322 and lysine 4319 are spatially near cysteine 4326 (6.0 and 10.5 Å away, respectively, along the long axis of the α-helix). Lysine 4331 is also near cysteine 4326 (7.5 Å along the long axis of the α-helix but on the opposite water-lipid interface) (Fig. 8, A and B). As noted earlier, the α-helix formed by residues 4315–4338 is predicted to bind lipids with high affinity. However, in the case of apoB95, the truncation after residue 4330 is predicted to substantially reduce the ability of the α-helix to associate stably with a lipid interface (see legend to Fig. 8). Thus, our analysis suggested two factors that could potentially underlie the inefficient Lp(a) formation with apoB95: the amphipathic α-helix lacks lysine 4331, and its ability to stably associate with a lipid interface is diminished as a result of the truncation. The aforementioned analysis is obviously predicated on the assumption that the sequences adjacent to cysteine 4326 are important for the initial interaction of apo(a) and apoB. However, our data cannot exclude the possibility that the apoB truncations result in conformational changes that indirectly affect the efficiency of Lp(a) assembly. For example, the slightly lower efficiency of Lp(a) formation with apoB97 than with apoB100 could be due to conformational changes that limit the access of apo(a) to its binding site on apoB. In addition, the markedly impaired efficiency of Lp(a) formation with apoB95 could result (at least in part) from conformational changes that prevent the binding of apo(a) to a binding site that is distant from cysteine 4326. The principal finding of this study, that the efficiency of Lp(a) formation is dependent on the carboxyl terminus of the molecule (particularly residues 4331–4397), provides a new foundation for studying the structural features of apoB required for Lp(a) assembly. The techniques used in this study, mutagenesis of a human apoB-YAC followed by expression studies in transgenic mice, provide a practical paradigm for future investigations to further define the nature of the interaction between apo(a) and apoB. The YAC gene-targeting system is effective and versatile and can be used to eliminate the lysines that surround cysteine 4326, to scramble stretches of amino acid residues, to replace human sequences with mouse sequences, or even to move residues 4315–4338 (the amphipathic α-helix containing cysteine 4326) to another site on the apoB molecule. The efficiency of generating human apoB transgenic mice with YAC DNA is high (equivalent in our hands to that obtained with plasmid or P1 DNA) (12McCormick S.P.A. Peterson K.R. Hammer R.E. Clegg C.H.

In addition, we believe that this series of experiments and analyses opens the door for other experimental strategies, such as testing whether certain apoB polypeptides can interfere with Lp(a) formation. Delineating the apoB residues that cause it to bind to apo(a) could lead to the development of pharmaceutical agents that would interfere with the assembly of Lp(a). We thank G. Howard and S. Ordway for comments on the manuscript and A. Corder for graphics."
https://openalex.org/W2053297449,"The importance of regulating the cellular concentrations of the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), a major cellular substrate of protein kinase C, is indicated by the fact that mice lacking MARCKS exhibit gross abnormalities of central nervous system development and die shortly after birth. We previously identified a novel means of regulating cellular MARCKS concentrations that involved a specific proteolytic cleavage of the protein and implicated a cysteine protease in this process (Spizz, G., and Blackshear, P. J. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 553–562). Here we show that p40, the carboxyl-terminal fragment resulting from this cleavage of MARCKS, was associated with the mitochondrial/lysosomal pellet fraction of human diploid fibroblasts and that its generation in cells was sensitive to treatment with NH4Cl. These data suggest the involvement of lysosomes in the generation and/or stability of p40. The MARCKS-cleaving enzyme (MCE) activity was peripherally associated with a 10,000 ×g pellet fraction from bovine liver, and it co-purified with the activity and immunoreactivity of a lysosomal protease, cathepsin B. Cathepsin B catalyzed the generation of p40 from MARCKS in a cell-free system and behaved similarly to the MCE with respect to mutants of MARCKS previously shown to be poor substrates for the MCE. Treatment of fibroblasts with a cell-permeable, specific inhibitor of cathepsin B, CA074-Me, resulted in parallel time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of cathepsin B and MCE activity. Incubation of a synthetic MARCKS phosphorylation site domain peptide with purified cathepsin B resulted in cleavage of the peptide at sites consistent with preferred cathepsin B substrate sites. These data provide evidence for the identity of the MCE as cathepsin B and suggest that this cleavage most likely takes place within lysosomes, perhaps as a result of specific lysosomal targeting sequences within the MARCKS primary sequence. The data also suggest a direct interaction between MARCKS and cathepsin B in cells and leave open the possibility that MARCKS may in some way regulate the protease for which it is a substrate.

In addition, we recently demonstrated that the cellular concentrations of MARCKS can also be regulated by a proteolytic event. This proteolytic cleavage results in amino- and carboxyl-terminal fragments of MARCKS that co-exist in cells with the full-length protein. This cleavage of MARCKS was inhibited in intact fibroblasts by activation of PKC, concomitant with an increase in MARCKS levels. In a cell-free system, PKC-phosphorylated MARCKS was a poor substrate and unphosphorylated MARCKS was a good substrate for a cysteine protease that was capable of cleaving MARCKS into its two characteristic fragments (15Spizz G. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These data suggested that the phosphorylation site domain (PSD) of MARCKS might regulate the ability of MARCKS to serve as a proteolytic substrate. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of one of two carboxyl-terminal fragments purified from bovine spleen demonstrated that one site of cleavage was three amino acids amino-terminal to the PSD, implicating the PSD as a regulatory site for interaction with the protease rather than as the actual site of cleavage. The purpose of the present study was to identify the intracellular cysteine protease responsible for this specific cleavage of MARCKS. Conventional purification methodology resulted in the partial co-purification from bovine liver of the lysosomal cysteine protease, cathepsin B, with the MARCKS-cleaving enzyme (MCE) activity. In addition, cathepsin B exhibited the same specificity toward MARCKS and its mutants as did the MCE. Lysosomal involvement in intact cells was confirmed by the sensitivity of the MCE activity to NH4Cl treatment. Using a cell-permeable, specific inhibitor of cathepsin B, CA074-Me, we demonstrated inhibition of the cellular MCE in human fibroblasts that was parallel in concentration dependence and time course with the inhibition of cathepsin B. Finally, using purified cathepsin B and synthetic substrates, we demonstrated that cleavage by cathepsin B occurs within the PSD of MARCKS. These data suggest that cathepsin B behaves as an MCE in cell-free systems and is the MCE in intact fibroblasts that is responsible for the PKC-regulated cleavage of MARCKS into two relatively stable products. Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF, Clonetics, San Diego, CA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). To serum starve cells, confluent cultures were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM supplemented as above except that it contained 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA, lyophilized and crystallized; Sigma). To label the cells withl-[35S]cysteine, DMEM lacking cysteine and methionine (Life Technologies, Inc.) was supplemented with 0.1% BSA, glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin as above and 10 mml-methionine. l-[35S]Cysteine (NEN Life Science Products) was added at 0.1–0.2 mCi/ml. For metabolic labeling, cells were serum-starved and radiolabeled for 16 h. For experiments requiring pulse labeling, cells were serum-starved overnight in complete DMEM as above followed by transfer to labeling medium for the indicated times. For experiments involving NH4Cl, a 1:100 dilution of a 2 m stock solution was added directly to medium resulting in a final concentration of 20 mm NH4Cl. For these experiments, an equivalent volume of H2O was added for control treatment. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a water-jacketed incubator supplemented with 5% CO2. Fibroblasts were grown on three 100-cm tissue culture dishes, serum-starved, and metabolically labeled as described above. Medium was aspirated, and cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold PBS. Using a rubber policeman, the cells were scraped into 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) containing 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 200 nmaprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine HCl, 2 μmleupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, and 574 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The dishes were rinsed with 2 ml of the same buffer for a final volume of 3 ml. The cells were homogenized with 30 strokes of a Wheaton glass homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min; the supernatants were transferred to a new tube, and the pellets were washed with 0.5 ml of the same buffer and re-centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred to a new tube, and the 10,000 × g pellets were washed with 0.5 ml of the above buffer and re-centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for another 20 min. This supernatant was combined with the first supernatant, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of the same buffer as above and adjusted to 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, and 50 mm NaF. The combined supernatants from the 10,000 × g spins were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting pellet was resuspended like the pellet from the 10,000 × g centrifugation, and the supernatant was adjusted to 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, and 50 mm NaF. An aliquot of each sample was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid to determine trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity. The precipitates were collected on glass fiber filters, and the filters were washed once with 5% trichloroacetic acid and once with 95% ethanol. The filters were then placed in a scintillation vial with 5 ml of Ready Safe Liquid Scintillation Mixture (Beckman Instruments Inc.; Fullerton, CA), and radioactivity was determined using an LS3801 liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments Inc.). The samples were boiled for 10 min, chilled on ice for 10 min, and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Equivalent amounts of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity were immunoprecipitated with MARCKS-specific antibodies and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described (15Spizz G. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts were serum-starved and metabolically labeled overnight followed by treatment with NH4Cl or H2O for different times as described above. For analysis of total cell proteins, detergent extracts of cells were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with MARCKS-specific antibodies as described (15Spizz G. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For subcellular fractionation of cells, labeled fibroblasts were treated for 15 min with NH4Cl or H2O as above with the following exceptions: 1) cells from five 100-cm dishes were used for each treatment, and they were originally collected in a combined volume of 4 ml; 2) pellets from the 600 × g and 10,000 ×g centrifugations were washed and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer; and 3) the 100,000 × g pellet was washed in 0.5 ml buffer and recentrifuged for 1 h at 4 °C. Bovine liver was obtained fresh from the slaughterhouse, kept on ice during transit, and used within 1–2 h. The following procedures were performed at 4 °C. Approximately 200 g of tissue was rinsed and cut into smaller pieces in ice-cold PBS followed by homogenization in 7.5 volumes of buffer A: 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.2) containing 150 mm NaCl, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 nm aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine HCl, 1 μm pepstatin, and 574 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Leupeptin was eliminated from this buffer since we were assaying a leupeptin-sensitive protease. Homogenization was achieved with either a Waring type blendor or Polytron mixer. Similar results were obtained using either method. For both methods, low speeds were used to avoid foaming. Homogenization was considered complete when chunks of tissue were no longer seen in the mixture. Homogenates were stirred for another hour in the cold. Mixtures were filtered through cheesecloth followed by centrifugation at 600 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 45 min. The resulting pellet was washed in buffer A, followed by two washes in buffer B, which is the same as buffer A except without NaCl and sucrose. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 400 ml of this buffer and then frozen and stored in 25-ml aliquots at −70 °C. For purification, an aliquot was thawed, refrozen and thawed, and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The pH of the supernatant was approximately 5.0 and was brought to approximately 6.9 with 1 n NH4OH. Ammonium sulfate was added slowly with stirring to a final saturation of 50%. This mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. Ammonium sulfate was added slowly with stirring to the resulting supernatant to bring the final saturation to 80%. This mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of buffer B. The NH4SO4 was removed through sequential concentration and dilution using a Centriprep-10 filtration unit following the manufacturer's instructions (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). The final solution was diluted to 10 ml with buffer B and applied to a 1-ml Mono-Q anion exchange column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The column was developed using fast protein liquid chromatography. The sample was applied to the column at a rate of 0.5 ml/min in buffer B, followed by washing using the same conditions. When the absorbance at 280 nm reached base line, the salt gradient was initiated. Half-ml fractions were collected at 0.5 ml/min using a 20-ml gradient of approximately 0–300 mm NaCl. Protease inhibitors excluding leupeptin were included in all column runs. When required, fractions eluted from the Mono-Q column were adjusted to 8% (v/v) glycerol and frozen at −70 °C. Enzyme activity remained stable upon thawing of these fractions. After the fractions containing the MCE activity were identified, they were pooled and prepared for separation by phenyl-Sepharose hydrophobic chromatography. Fractions were thawed and adjusted to 1.7 mNH4SO4. Using fast protein liquid chromatography, the sample was applied to a 1-ml phenyl-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in buffer B adjusted to 1.7m NH4SO4. Columns were washed in the same buffer, and column elution was initiated when the absorbance at 280 nm reached base line. Column elution was carried out using a 30-ml gradient of 1.7 m to 0 mNH4SO4 in buffer B. Protease inhibitors excluding leupeptin were included in all chromatographic separations. The cell-permeable inhibitor, CA074-Me (Peptides International, Louisville, KY), was prepared as a 10 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) according to manufacturer's instructions. For concentration-response experiments, the 10 mm stock was further diluted in Me2SO resulting in 5, 1, 0.5, and 0.1 mmsolutions. These solutions were each diluted 1:100 in DMEM and then added to cell culture medium at a 1:100 dilution. Therefore, the final amount of Me2SO was 0.01% for all conditions, and 0.01% Me2SO was used as a control treatment. For concentration dependence experiments, cells were serum-starved with or without label overnight as described above. The following day, appropriate dilutions of CA074-Me or Me2SO were added to medium, and cells were allowed to incubate for 4–5 h. Medium was removed, cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold PBS, and detergent extracts were prepared. Radiolabeled extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a MARCKS-specific antibody and analysis by SDS-PAGE as described (15Spizz G. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and nonradiolabeled extracts were used for cathepsin B and MCE assays (see below). For pretreatment experiments, cells were serum-starved overnight in serum-free DMEM containing cysteine and methionine and supplemented with antibiotics, glutamine, and 0.1% BSA (see above). The following day, cysteine/methionine-free DMEM supplemented with antibiotics, glutamine, methionine, and 0.1% BSA was used to replace the serum-starving medium used overnight. To this was added a 1:100 dilution of 100 μm CA074-Me, prepared as above, resulting in a final concentration of 1 μm, or an equivalent amount of Me2SO. Cells were pretreated with inhibitor or Me2SO for the indicated times. Following pretreatment, l-[35S]cysteine was added directly to the medium at 150 μCi/ml, and the cultures were allowed to incubate for another hour. The medium was removed, and cultures were prepared for analysis by immunoprecipitation of MARCKS as described above. For these experiments the PBS used to rinse the cells was supplemented with 2–4 μm leupeptin and 5 μm CA074-Me; cell lysis buffer was supplemented with 2–4 μm leupeptin and 5 μm CA074-Me in addition to standard protease inhibitors already present. This was done to make sure that the cells were continuously exposed to inhibitor following initial treatment. For the assay of cathepsin B and MCE activity in cell extracts in pretreatment experiments, everything was as above except DMEM containing cysteine and methionine was used. Cell extracts were prepared as for immunoprecipitation except with the absence of leupeptin or CA074-Me. One-ml extracts were made from each 100-mm dish of confluent fibroblasts. From this, 180 and 200 μl were assayed for MCE or cathepsin B activities, respectively. The results were normalized to protein concentration as quantitated using the Bio-Rad assay (Bio-Rad) and BSA as a standard. MCE activity was assayed as described (15Spizz G. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In certain cases, the activity was assayed in the 10,000 ×g fraction of bovine liver that had been frozen and thawed twice followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. This generally resulted in a sample containing 1–2 mg/ml protein, of which 20 μl was assayed. Otherwise, 10-μl aliquots of the Mono-Q fractions or 20-μl aliquots of the phenyl-Sepharose fractions were assayed in a final volume of 80 or 200 μl, respectively, of buffer B containing 200 mm NaCl. Bovine spleen cathepsin B (Sigma) was assayed for MCE activity in an 80-μl reaction volume. Cathepsin B units are based on the manufacturer's designation, i.e. 1 unit will hydrolyze 1 μmol of Nα-CBZ-lysine p-nitrophenyl ester per min at pH 5.0 at 25 °C. Approximately 10,000 cpm of [35S]cysteine-labeled, in vitro-translated MARCKS was added as substrate to initiate the reaction. To assay for MCE activity, non-myristoylated MARCKS as described was used (15Spizz G. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In experiments comparing the rates of cleavage by cathepsin B and the MCE activity, wild-type myristoylated MARCKS was used, as well as myristoylated proteins containing asparagine and aspartic acid replacement of the serines within the phosphorylation site domain (PSD; 16). In addition, non-myristoylated substrates containing serines or aspartic acid replacement of the serines in the PSD was used. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for the indicated times. Reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) followed by fluorography as described (15Spizz G. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Films were scanned using a DeskScan II scanner (Hewlett-Packard), and Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Inc.). Scanned images were analyzed with NIH Image (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health). Cathepsin B activity in column fractions or cell extracts was assayed using the colorimetric assay described by Barrett (17Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). A 25-amino acid peptide representing the PSD of MARCKS was synthesized as described (18Graff J.M. Rajan R.R. Randall R.R. Nairn A.C. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14390-14398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 1 mm solution of the peptide was prepared fresh and then 20 nmol were incubated with 0.09 units of cathepsin B in a final volume of 80 μl for 1 h. The reactions were stopped by boiling for 10 min, followed by chilling on ice and clarification by centrifugation. Samples were made 0.1% in trifluoroacetic acid, applied to a Brownlee Aquapore C8 column (Rainin Instrument Co., Ridgefield NJ) and then subjected to reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The column was developed using a gradient of 0–70% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Purified peaks of absorbance at 214 nm were subjected to Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) sequencer, model 470 A. A cDNA representing the sequence of p40 (15Spizz G. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was constructed using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega, Madison, WI). A full-length human MARCKS cDNA was subcloned into the pALTER-1 vector at unique XbaI and HindIII sites. The primer, 5′-CCAAGGCCGAGGACGGGGCCACGCCCAAGCTTACCATGGAGACCCCGAAAAAAAAAAAGA-3′, was used to place an initiator methionine within an optimum Kozak sequence directly upstream of Glu148. In addition, aHindIII site was placed upstream of the methionine so that following mutagenesis a HindIII fragment representing p40 could be subcloned into HindIII cut Bluescript KS+ vector. The mutant cDNA was subcloned into Bluescript, and the correct sequence was confirmed by automated sequencing using an Applied Biosystems DNA sequencer, model 373A. Following linearization of the Bluescript/p40 chimera with EcoRI, mRNA was synthesizedin vitro using T3 RNA polymerase (Promega) (16Swierczynski S.L. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13436-13445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The resulting mRNA was translated in vitro as described previously (15Spizz G. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The in vitro translated products were subjected to cleavage with cathepsin B as described above. When required, in vitro translated products with or without cathepsin B cleavage were adjusted to 0.1% Nonidet P-40, immunoprecipitated with MARCKS-specific antibodies, and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE as described (15Spizz G. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). p40 was partially purified from bovine spleen as described (15Spizz G. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The heat-stable, trichloroacetic acid-precipitated material was subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis using the gel system described (19Blackshear P.J. Nemenoff R.A. Avruch J. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The proteins from the 10% SDS-PAGE gel were transferred to nitrocellulose and processed for immunoblot analysis as described below. To assay for the presence of immunoreactive cathepsin B in purified fractions, aliquots were boiled in SDS sample buffer for 3 min and separated by 11% SDS-PAGE. In the case of the fractions from phenyl-Sepharose chromatography, 500-μl fractions were concentrated and desalted using a Centricon-10 filter (Amicon). Separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schuell) in 192 mmglycine, 25 mm Tris (pH 7.6), and 20% (v/v) methanol using a Transphor apparatus (Hoefer; San Francisco, CA). All steps in the following immunoblotting method were performed at room temperature. Nonspecific sites on filters were blocked by incubation and shaking for 1 h with 5% (w/v) instant milk in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6) containing 137 mm NaCl and 0.3% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST). Filters were briefly rinsed with TBST followed by incubation with a 1:500 dilution in TBST of a rabbit polyclonal antibody generated against recombinant human cathepsin B (generously provided by Dr. John Mort, Joint Diseases Laboratory, Shriners' Hospital for Crippled Children, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) (20Rowan A.D.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1197-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Filters were then incubated with antibody for 1 h with shaking and then rinsed three times by shaking in TBST for 10 min each time. The filters were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) at a 1:5000 dilution in TBST for 30 min with shaking and then rinsed three times in TBST for 10 min each time. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.) following the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoblotting of MARCKS proteins, filters were incubated with a 1:100 dilution of a MARCKS-specific monoclonal antibody (15Spizz G. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). When competing peptides were used, an equivalent volume of a 5 mm peptide solution and antibody were mixed and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with tumbling prior to incubation with the filter. As an initial step in identifying the protease responsible for the cleavage of MARCKS and the generation of p40, we attempted to determine whether this was a lysosomal event. Proteolysis within lysosomes is dependent on an acidic environment (17Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar,22Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with ammonium chloride has been shown to increase lysosomal pH, resulting in the inhibition of normal lysosomal proteolytic events (22Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dean R.T. Jessup W. Roberts C.R. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 27-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To determine if the generation and/or stability of p40 was pH-dependent, radiolabeled cells were treated with 20 mm NH4Cl for different times; detergent extracts of these cells were then prepared and analyzed for the presence of immunoprecipitable p40 (Fig.1). Within 5 min of treatment of cells with NH4Cl, the fraction of p40 was decreased by 32%; this cont"

A. 1997; 94: 1437-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). One issue concerning the genotoxic stress response is how DNA damage is converted into informational intracellular signals that affect cell behavior. Whereas IR induces DNA double-strand breaks (9Kemp L.M. Sedgwick S.G. Jeggo P.A. Mutat. Res. 1984; 132: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is activated by double-strand breaks and other DNA lesions (10Carter T. Vancurova I.

Bharti A. Yuan Z.-M. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Kufe D. Nature. 1997; 386: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In a potential feedback mechanism, c-Abl phosphorylates and inhibits DNA-PK activity (13Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Jin S. Inoue S. Bharti A. Yuan Z.-M. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Kufe D. Nature. 1997; 386: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Other work has shown that c-Abl interacts with the product of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene and that ATM may also be responsible for activating c-Abl as a consequence of genotoxic stress (14Baskaran R. Wood L.D. Whitaker L.L. Xu Y. Barlow C. Canman C.E. Morgan S.E. Baltimore D. Wynshaw-Boris A. Kastan M.B. Wang J.Y.J.

The findings that cells defective in DNA-PK or ATM are hypersensitive to the lethal effects of IR (16Jeggo P.A. Taccioli G.E. Jackson S.P. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 17Roth D.B. Lindahl T. Gellert M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 496-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), whereas c-Abl-deficient cells are resistant to IR-induced killing (8Yuan Z.-M. Huang Y. Ishiko T. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1437-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), has suggested that functional interactions between c-Abl and DNA-PK or ATM may contribute to cell fate. The DNA-PK catalytic subunit and ATM are related to members of the PI 3-kinase family, such as Tor1p, Tor2p, FKBP-rapamycin-associated protein, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rad 3, involved in cell cycle control and DNA repair (18Hartley K.O.

PI 3-kinase is activated by growth factor receptors and has been implicated in transducing survival signals (19Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. Bioassays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Inositol lipids phosphorylated at the D3 position by PI 3-kinase function in part in the activation of the Akt (protein kinase B) serine/threonine protein kinase (20Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R.

Jordan J. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P.N. Hay N. Genes & Dev. 1997; 11: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar) and the c-Myc protein (25Kaufmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Activation of Akt thus promotes survival, whereas inhibition of PI 3-kinase with wortmannin induces apoptosis (24Kennedy S.G. Wagner A.J. Conzen S.D. Jordan J. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P.N. Hay N. Genes & Dev. 1997; 11: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 26Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that signaling mechanisms that down-regulate PI 3-kinase would be pro-apoptotic. However, whereas autophosphorylation of PI 3-kinase on serine inhibits PI 3-kinase activity (27Carpenter C.L. Auger K.R. Duckworth B.C. Hou W.M. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell.

The present studies demonstrate that c-Abl associates with PI 3-kinase. Phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase by c-Abl inhibits PI 3-kinase activity. The results also show that c-Abl phosphorylates and inhibits PI 3-kinase in IR-treated cells. Human U-937 myeloid leukemia cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were grown as described (29Kharbanda S.

Irradiation was performed at room temperature using a Gammacell 1000 (Atomic Energy of Canada) under aerobic conditions with a 137Cs source emitting at a fixed dose rate of 0.76 Gy min−1 as determined by dosimetry.

Soluble proteins were incubated with anti-c-Abl (Ab-3; Oncogene Science) or anti-p85 (06–195; Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) and precipitated with protein A-Sepharose for an additional 1 h. The immune complexes were washed with lysis buffer (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaF, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin), separated by electrophoresis in SDS/polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose paper. The filters were incubated with anti-p85 (P13020; Transduction Laboratories), anti-c-Abl, or anti-P-Tyr (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.). GST, GST-c-Abl FL (full-length) (32Mayer B.J. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell.

Cell lysates were incubated with immobilized GST or GST fusion protein for 2 h at 4 °C. The resulting protein complexes were separated by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-p85 or anti-c-Abl. Recombinant kinase active c-Abl was prepared from baculovirus-infected insect cells (32Mayer B.J. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2883-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). GST-p85 was incubated with heat-inactivated (HI) or kinase-active c-Abl and [γ-32P]ATP in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2 and 10 mmMnCl2) for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction products were analyzed by 8% SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. PI 3-kinase activity was measured as described (35Sung C.K. Sanchez-Margalet V. Goldfien I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12503-12507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in lipid kinase buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μmsodium vanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 2 μg/ml phosphatidylinositol (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) and [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 6 n HCl and chloroform/methanol (1:1). The organic layer was separated and spotted on a Silica Gel-60 plate (Sigma). Phosphorylation was assessed by thin layer chromatography and autoradiography. c-Abl interacts with the PI 3-kinase-related DNA-PK and ATM proteins (13Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Jin S. Inoue S. Bharti A. Yuan Z.-M. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Kufe D. Nature. 1997; 386: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 15Shafman T. Khanna K.K. Kedar P. Yen T. Spring K. Kozlov S. Gatei M. Zhang N. Watters D. Egerton M. Shiloh Y. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Lavin M.F. Nature. 1997; 387: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). To determine if c-Abl associates with PI 3-kinase, anti-c-Abl immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody against the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. The results demonstrate constitutive binding of c-Abl and PI 3-kinase (Fig.1 A). The activation of c-Abl by IR treatment (1Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) had little effect on the interaction (Fig.1 A). The finding that the p85 protein detected in the anti-c-Abl immunoprecipitates exhibits a slightly decreased electrophoretic mobility compared with that in total cell lysates supports binding of c-Abl to only certain post-translationally modified forms or specific isoforms of p85. Analysis of anti-p85 immunoprecipitates with anti-c-Abl in the reciprocal experiment confirmed binding of c-Abl and PI 3-kinase in control and irradiated cells (Fig. 1 B). Incubation of cell lysates with GST fusion proteins demonstrated binding of p85 to full-length c-Abl and to Abl SH3 but not to the N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 (Fig. 1 C). The c-Abl SH3 domain binds to proline-rich sequences with the PXXP consensus (33Ren R. Ye Z.-S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 36Feller S. Ren R. Hanafusa H. Baltimore D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 453-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The presence of potential sequences for c-Abl binding in the p85 subunit suggested that there may be a direct interaction. The finding that GST-p85 binds to recombinant c-Abl purified from a baculovirus expression system provided evidence for a direct interaction between these proteins (Fig. 1 D). To assess the functional significance of the interaction between c-Abl and p85, we asked if PI 3-kinase is a substrate for c-Abl. Incubation of recombinant kinase-active c-Abl with GST-p85 resulted in phosphorylation of p85 (Fig.2 A). c-Abl exhibited no detectable phosphorylation of GST alone (data not shown), and there was no phosphorylation of p85 with heat-inactivated c-Abl (Fig.2 A). To determine whether DNA damage induces c-Abl-dependent phosphorylation of p85, anti-P-Tyr immunoprecipitates were assayed from mouse fibroblasts deficient in c-Abl (Abl−/−) (30Tybulewicz V.L.J. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar) and after stable expression of c-Abl in this background (Abl+) (1Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Irradiation of the Abl+ fibroblasts was associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit (Fig. 2 B). By contrast, there was no IR-induced phosphorylation of p85 in the Abl−/− cells (Fig. 2 B). Reprobing the filters with an antibody against the PI 3-kinase p110 subunit demonstrated no detectable reactivity (data not shown). These results indicate that IR induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase by a c-Abl-dependent mechanism. To confirm these findings, we irradiated MCF-7 cells that were stably transfected with empty vector (MCF-7/pSR) or the dominant negative, kinase-inactive c-Abl(K-R) (6Yuan Z.M. Huang Y. Whang Y. Sawyers C. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Nature. 1996; 382: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Anti-p85 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr. The finding that tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 is substantially abrogated in IR-treated MCF-7/c-Abl(K-R) cells as compared with MCF-7/pSR cells supports c-Abl-dependent phosphorylation of p85 following irradiation (Fig. 2 C). The p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase is required for the lipid kinase activity of p110 (37Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Hirano M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 2675-2685Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To determine if c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation of p85 affects PI 3-kinase activity, anti-p85 immunoprecipitates were incubated with a stoichiometric excess of purified recombinant c-Abl. Heat-inactivated c-Abl had no effect on phosphorylation of PI, whereas kinase-active c-Abl inhibited PI 3-kinase activity (Fig.3 A). To assess the effects of IR treatment, anti-c-Abl immunoprecipitates from control and irradiated cells were analyzed for PI 3-kinase activity. The precipitates from control cells exhibited phosphorylation of PI, whereas this activity was inhibited in IR-treated cells (Fig. 3 B). Analysis of anti-p85 immunoprecipitates from IR-treated Abl+ cells also demonstrated down-regulation of PI 3-kinase activity (Fig.3 C). However, IR treatment of Abl−/− cells had little if any effect on PI phosphorylation compared with that in control Abl−/− cells (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation of p85 inhibits PI 3-kinase activity. The available evidence indicates that control of PI 3-kinase is important in determining cell fate. However, other than down-regulation of PI 3-kinase by autophosphorylation on serine (27Carpenter C.L. Auger K.R. Duckworth B.C. Hou W.M. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1657-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 28Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry J.M. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S.A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), there are no known negative regulatory effectors of this kinase. The present findings demonstrate that the SH3 domain of c-Abl binds constitutively to PI 3-kinase. The results also support the hypothesis that activation of c-Abl by DNA damage (1Kharbanda S. Ren R.

Nature. 1996; 384: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) down-regulates PI 3-kinase activity by phosphorylation of p85. Importantly, transforming variants of c-Abl, such as Bcr-Abl and v-Abl, have been found to activate PI 3-kinase (39Varticovski L. Daley G.Q. Jackson P. Baltimore D. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1107-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 40Skorski T. Kanakaraj P. Nieborowska-Skorska M. Ratajczak M.Z. Wen S.-C. Zon G. Gewirtz A.M. Perussia B. Calabretta B. Blood. 1995; 86: 726-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the present finding that c-Abl inhibits PI 3-kinase activity is in contrast to the effects of oncogenic c-Abl variants. The molecular basis for this difference could be important to our understanding of transformation by genetic alterations of the c-abl gene. The demonstration that cells deficient in c-Abl are resistant to IR-induced apoptosis has supported a pro-apoptotic function for c-Abl in the cell death response to DNA damage (8Yuan Z.-M. Huang Y. Ishiko T. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1437-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). By contrast, Bcr-Abl expression inhibits the apoptotic response to DNA-damaging agents (41Bedi A. Barber J.P. Bedi G.C. El-Deiry W.S. Sidransky D. Vala M.S. Akhtar A.J. Hilton J. Jones R.J.

Taken together with the functional interaction found between c-Abl and PI 3-kinase in the present studies, these findings suggest that c-Abl could contribute to the regulation of cell fate through down-regulation of PI 3-kinase. The present results also provide the first evidence for a tyrosine kinase that negatively regulates PI 3-kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2024413363,"We have examined the in vivolocalization of extracellular ecto-ATPase and ecto-apyrase (ATPDase) in adult chicken gizzard and stomach by immunofluorescence and laser scanning confocal microscopy. In chicken gizzard, the ecto-ATPase was distributed in discrete clusters restricted to the sarcolemma of the smooth muscle cells. Anti-ecto-apyrase antibody detected a single 80-kDa band (putative apyrase) in Western blots of both chicken gizzard membrane extracts and partially purified anion exchange fractions, but the antibody did not detect ecto-apyrase in immunolabeled gizzard cryosections. In adult chicken stomach, the ecto-apyrase was observed at the apical membrane of the glandular oxyntico-peptic cells as described in previous immunoperoxidase studies (Stout, J. G., R. S. Strobel, and T. L. Kirley (1995) Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 36, 529–535). However, ecto-ATPase was clustered in the sarcolemma of the organized layer of circular smooth muscle and in smooth muscle cells of the septa surrounding the glandular tissue, but not in the glandular cells containing the ecto-apyrase. The findings indicate compartmentalization of the two related extracellular nucleotide hydrolyzing enzymes and suggest differential functions that are specialized for different regions of the chicken stomach.We also partially purified the ecto-apyrase of chicken stomach, an 80-kDa membrane glycoprotein. Chicken stomach membranes were solubilized in digitonin, glycoproteins were separated from solubilized proteins by lectin chromatography, and nucleotide-binding glycoproteins were selected by immobilized Cibacron blue chromatography. Further purification by size exclusion and anion exchange chromatography yielded purification of 94-fold. The ATPase specific activity of the purified stomach ecto-apyrase was 75,000 μmol of Pi/mg of protein/h, and the purified preparation consisted of a major band (55% of total protein) at 80 kDa. The purified enzyme could be deglycosylated with peptide N-glycosidase-F to a core molecular mass of 54 kDa. The N-terminal sequence of the 80-kDa stomach ecto-apyrase band (which reacted with anti-ecto-ATPDase antibodies) was determined to be: MEYKGKVVAGLLTATWV. Immunological cross-reactivity data indicate that the stomach 80-kDa protein isolated is an ecto-apyrase and is related to both the chicken liver and oviduct ecto-ATPDase enzymes characterized earlier, as well as to the human lymphoid cell activation antigen, CD39. We have examined the in vivolocalization of extracellular ecto-ATPase and ecto-apyrase (ATPDase) in adult chicken gizzard and stomach by immunofluorescence and laser scanning confocal microscopy.

The ATPase specific activity of the purified stomach ecto-apyrase was 75,000 μmol of Pi/mg of protein/h, and the purified preparation consisted of a major band (55% of total protein) at 80 kDa. The purified enzyme could be deglycosylated with peptide N-glycosidase-F to a core molecular mass of 54 kDa. The N-terminal sequence of the 80-kDa stomach ecto-apyrase band (which reacted with anti-ecto-ATPDase antibodies) was determined to be: MEYKGKVVAGLLTATWV. Immunological cross-reactivity data indicate that the stomach 80-kDa protein isolated is an ecto-apyrase and is related to both the chicken liver and oviduct ecto-ATPDase enzymes characterized earlier, as well as to the human lymphoid cell activation antigen, CD39. The importance of extracellular nucleotides in biology is just beginning to be appreciated. Extracellular nucleotides have been implicated in many important physiological processes (1Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Enzymes for hydrolyzing extracellular nucleotides, including ecto-ATPases and ecto-apyrases (which we call collectively ecto-ATP(D)ases), have been implicated in termination of purinergic stimulation of muscle (2Burnstock G.

Regarding the last putative function, the lymphoid cell activation antigen, CD39, which is also found on vascular endothelial cells, has recently been identified as an ecto-apyrase (11Wang T.-F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9898-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Soluble forms of apyrases hold promise as being useful clinically as anti-tissue graft rejection agents (12Robson S.C. Candinas D. Siegel J.B. Kopp C. Millan M. Hancock W.W. Bach F.H. Transplant. Proc. 1996; 28 (536): 536PubMed Google Scholar, 13Candinas D. Koyamada N. Miyatake T. Siegel J. Hancock W.W. Bach F.H. Robson S.C. Thromb.

Soluble forms of nucleotidases may also be an important mechanism for the termination of the actions of ATP used as a neurotransmitter (14Todorov L.D. Mihayalova-Todorova S. Westfall T.D. Sneddon P. Kennedy C. Bjur R.A. Westfall D.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). For a review of the structures and functions of the ecto-ATPases, the reader is referred to a recent review of the subject (15Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), as well as a very recent book describing the work presented at an international conference on the subject of ecto-ATPases (16). Our laboratory has been studying the structure and function of the ecto-ATPases and ecto-apyrases (ecto-ATPDases) 1The abbreviations used are: ecto-ATPDase, ecto-ATP diphosphohydrolase (ecto-apyrase); BSA, bovine serum albumin; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; CD39, lymphoid cell activation antigen (ecto-apyrase); ConA, concanavalin A lectin; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; MC 18, anti-chicken stomach ecto-apyrase monoclonal antibody 18; mAb 15, anti-chicken gizzard ecto-ATPase monoclonal antibody 15; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PNGase-F, peptide N-glycosidase-F; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride membrane; QMA, quaternary ammonium anion; TRITC, tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate. for the last decade. We have been very involved in the purification of these enzymes because it is critical to the understanding of the structure and function of these integral membrane glycoproteins, as well as being necessary for the development of probes that are specific for ecto-ATPases and ecto-apyrases. We are interested in determining structural and functional similarities and differences between the ecto-ATPases (which do not hydrolyze nucleoside diphosphates) and ecto-apyrases (ecto-ATPDases), which hydrolyze nucleoside diphosphates at similar rates as nucleoside triphosphates. Previously (17Stout J.G. Kirley T.L. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1994; 29: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Stout J.G. Strobel R.S. Kirley T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11845-11850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we purified and characterized the ecto-ATPase from chicken smooth muscle (gizzard). In addition, we showed that chicken stomach was a good source of ecto-ATPDase (19Stout J.G. Strobel R.S. Kirley T.L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 36: 529-535PubMed Google Scholar) that was immunologically indistinguishable from that purified by others from chicken oviduct and liver (20Strobel R.S. Nagy A.K. Knowles A.F. Buegel J. Rosenberg M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16323-16331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the function of both the ecto-ATPases and ecto-apyrases, we have immunolocalized both enzymes in adult chicken gizzard and stomach. In gizzard, the ecto-ATPase is localized to the surface of the smooth muscle cells, and the ecto-apyrase is not detected. In contrast, in stomach, the ecto-apyrase is found predominantly in the glandular region (consistent with previous results; Ref. 19Stout J.G. Strobel R.S. Kirley T.L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 36: 529-535PubMed Google Scholar), while the ecto-ATPase is found predominantly on the surface of the smooth muscle cells. This mutually exclusive localization of the two enzymes indicates that these two structurally related enzymes perform very different functions in these tissues. We also purified the chicken stomach 80-kDa ecto-apyrase glycoprotein, showed that it is immunologically related to human CD39, and showed that both are likely to exist as intermolecularly disulfide-linked homooligomers. The chicken gizzard (ecto-ATPase) and stomach (ecto-apyrase) constitute an easily available system, which is amenable to further characterization of the comparative structure and function of the ecto-ATPase/apyrase systems on the protein biochemical level. Tissue from adult chickens (female Ross Avian 24) was obtained fresh from a local poultry slaughterhouse. All reagent grade chemicals were acquired from Fisher Scientific. Digitonin, concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B, gum tragacanth, sucrose, Tris, and MOPS were from Sigma. Goat anti-mouse TRITC and goat anti-mouse HRP were purchased from Jackson Immunochemicals and Calbiochem, respectively. Size exclusion matrix Sephacryl S-300 was obtained from Pharmacia. Mem-Sep quaternary ammonium anion (QMA) 1000 membrane anion exchanger was ordered from Millipore-Waters. All electrophoresis apparati, chemicals, standards, and the Econo-Pac Cibacron blue column were purchased from Bio-Rad. The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent kit was from DuPont. Beckman rotors were used in all centrifugation preparations. Approximately 200 g of chicken gizzards or stomachs were trimmed of connective tissue and fat and cut into small pieces. The tissue was homogenized in a 7.0-amp commercial Waring blender in 2 liters of tissue homogenization buffer (buffer: 30 mm MOPS, 2 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4) for 2 min at full speed. The homogenate was centrifuged for 35 min at 10,000 rpm in a JA-14 rotor (15,000 × g). The supernatant was poured through two layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 rpm in a 35Ti rotor (30,000 ×g). The supernatant was then centrifuged for 60 min at 44,000 rpm in a 45Ti rotor (150,000 × g). The pellet was homogenized in approximately 20 ml of 30 mm MOPS and 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and loaded on a discontinuous sucrose gradient of 15 and 45% sucrose dissolved in 30 mm MOPS and 2 mm EDTA. After centrifugation for 16 h at 25,000 rpm in a SW28 rotor (85,000 × g), the white membrane bands at the 15–45% interface were collected, diluted, and pelleted by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 90 min. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad CB-250 dye binding technique according to the modifications of Stoscheck (21Stoscheck C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 22Stoscheck C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 160: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard protein. The Mg-ATPase (ecto-ATPase) activity was measured using a modification (23Kirley T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12682-12689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the technique of Fiske and Subbarow (24Fiske C.H. SubbaRow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The unstimulated Mg-ATPase specific activity of the gizzard membranes was 100–300 μmol/mg/h, and the unstimulated specific activity of the stomach membranes was 700–1300 μmol/mg/h. In partial purification experiments, 5 mg of adult chicken gizzard or stomach membrane protein was solubilized at 1.0 mg/ml with 1% digitonin in 20 mm MOPS and 2 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4. The solution was gently mixed at room temperature for 15 min, centrifuged at 48,000 rpm in a 50Ti rotor for 45 min, and the supernatants were diluted to 0.1% digitonin. The solubilized proteins were then loaded unto a QMA Mem-Sep membrane anion exchanger (size 1000) equilibrated in 0.1% digitonin in 10 mm Tris and 2 mm MgCl2, pH 8.2 (buffer B), at 2 ml/min. The ion exchanger was then washed in 10 ml of buffer B and eluted with a gradient of 0–200 mm NaCl in buffer B. Fractions (1 ml) were assayed for ATPase or ADPase activity and Western-blotted with various antibodies to correlate antibody detection with measured enzyme activities in individual chromatographic fractions. Adult chicken stomach membranes (1.0 mg/ml) were solubilized in 1% digitonin in 20 mm MOPS and 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4. The solution was gently mixed at room temperature for 15 min and centrifuged at 48,000 rpm in a 50Ti rotor for 45 min, and the supernatant was diluted to 0.1% digitonin with the MOPS/MgCl2 buffer. The solubilized solution was incubated with 5 ml of concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B overnight at 4 °C. All of the following steps were performed at room temperature. The solubilized stomach-ConA mixture was poured into a column and washed with 10 column bed volumes of 0.1% digitonin in 20 mm MOPS and 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4 (buffer A). The ConA column was incubated for 10 min in 300 mmmethyl-α-d-mannopyranoside in buffer A and eluted in 30 ml of the same solution at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The entire 30-ml fraction was loaded directly onto a Bio-Rad Econo-Pac Cibacron blue column. The blue column was washed with 10 ml of 1 m NaCl in buffer A, and the ecto-ATPDase and other tightly bound proteins were eluted using a gradient of 0–8 m urea in buffer A. A flow rate of 1 ml/min was used throughout binding, washing, and elution of the Cibacron blue column. The eluted fractions were immediately put on ice, and ATPase activity was determined. The most active fractions were pooled and concentrated (at 40 °C) to a volume of 1 ml in a Centriprep 50 centrifugal concentrator and washed with five volumes of 0.1% digitonin in 10 mm Tris and 2 mmMgCl2, pH 8.2 (buffer B) to remove excess urea. The 1-ml washed fraction was loaded onto a Sephacryl-S300 size exclusion column equilibrated in buffer B. Fractions (2 ml) were collected at 0.5 ml/min, placed on ice, and assayed for ATPase activity. The most active fractions were pooled and directly loaded onto a QMA Mem-Sep 1000 anion exchanger cartridge. The cartridge was washed with 5 ml of buffer B, and the bound proteins were eluted by a 0–200 mm NaCl in buffer B salt gradient. The flow rate of loading, washing, and elution of the cartridge was 1 ml/min. Fractions (1 ml) were collected, kept on ice, and assayed for ATPase and ADPase activity, and the most active fractions were pooled to be used in deglycosylation and N-terminal sequencing experiments or run on SDS-PAGE gels (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The purified chicken stomach proteins were concentrated using a Centriprep 50 centrifugal concentrator, precipitated with four volumes of −20 °C acetone (26Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), and run on an SDS-PAGE gel according to Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) with or without prior deglycosylation with PNGase-F (27Treuheit M.J. Vaghy P.L. Kirley T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11777-11782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gel was either stained with Coomassie Blue or electroblotted onto PVDF membrane (28Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for N-terminal sequencing on a Porton 2090E protein sequencer located in the Department of Pharmacology and Cell Biophysics at the University of Cincinnati. Microsomes were diluted with Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) SDS sample buffer (containing 8 m urea) to a final protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. The samples were vortexed and boiled for 5 min. Ten micrograms of each sample was resolved by 5–15% SDS-PAGE gradient gels according to Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane by transblotting 2 h at 33 V in cold 10 mm CAPS, pH 11 (28Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PVDF membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% milk and 0.02% NaN3 in Tris-buffered saline and incubated overnight at room temperature in monoclonal antibodies mAb 15 (anti-chicken gizzard ecto-ATPase antibody; Ref. 18Stout J.G. Strobel R.S. Kirley T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11845-11850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), or MC18 (anti-chicken oviduct ecto-ATPDase (apyrase); Ref. 20Strobel R.S. Nagy A.K. Knowles A.F. Buegel J. Rosenberg M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16323-16331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The PVDF membranes were washed, incubated in goat anti-mouse IgG HRP conjugated secondary antibody, washed again, and developed in NEN Life Science Products ECL reagents as described by the manufacturer. Chicken gizzards and stomachs were immediately removed from sacrificed animals and rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.3. Tissue was oriented and cut into 5 × 5-mm blocks, mounted on cork with 10% gum tragacanth, and frozen in liquid N2-cooled isopentane. Cryosections (5 μm thick) were cut using a Zeiss Microm HM 500 OM cryostat, collected on Fisher Superfrost/Plus glass slides, and stored at −20 °C. The immunolabeling of tissue samples was performed at room temperature. Briefly, cryosections were blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)-PBS to prevent nonspecific binding of the probes. The slides were incubated for 2 h in primary monoclonal antibody (mAb 15 or MC18), washed in 1% BSA-PBS, and exposed to goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugated to rhodamine (TRITC) for 1 h. Control slides substituted 1% BSA-PBS for the primary antibodies. The slides were cover-slipped in a diazabicyclo(2.2.2)octane 70% glycerol mounting media and examined using a Bio-Rad MRC 600 laser scanning confocal microscope and CoMOS image analysis software. In previous studies, a bank of 18 different monoclonal antibodies, including mAb 15, raised against the partially purified 66-kDa chicken gizzard ecto-ATPase, were evaluated (18Stout J.G. Strobel R.S. Kirley T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11845-11850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study, immunoblots of various adult chicken tissue crude membrane extracts indicated that mAb 15 reacts strongly with a 66-kDa protein, the ecto-ATPase, in gizzard (Fig.1, lane 1) as well as faint bands of a similar molecular size in chicken skeletal muscle, brain, and stomach (Fig. 1, lanes 3, 4, and6, respectively). A monoclonal antibody against the native chicken oviduct ecto-apyrase, MC18, was used previously to characterize the chicken stomach ecto-apyrase in Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunocytochemistry experiments (20Strobel R.S. Nagy A.K. Knowles A.F. Buegel J. Rosenberg M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16323-16331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 29Strobel R. Rosenberg M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 671: 487-489Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Unlike our initial study (19Stout J.G. Strobel R.S. Kirley T.L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 36: 529-535PubMed Google Scholar), we observed that MC18 recognized a faint 80-kDa band in chicken gizzard membrane extracts (Fig. 2,lane 3) in addition to the abundant 80-kDa band normally observed in stomach and the stomach epithelial lining (Fig. 2,lanes 1 and 2). The presence of the 80-kDa protein in chicken gizzard was confirmed by immunoblots of QMA Mem-Sep partially purified gizzard proteins in which the distribution of MC18 binding to a 80-kDa immunoreactive band corresponded with ATPase/ADPase activity (data not shown). The observed specificity of these monoclonal antibodies for the respective antigens indicated that mAb 15 and MC 18 were appropriate probes for immunocytochemical experiments in which the distribution of both the ecto-ATPase and the ecto-apyrase could be examined in serial cryosections of chicken gizzard and stomach tissue. The chicken gizzard is a highly muscular organ composed of numerous parallel bundles of smooth muscle separated by bands of dense connective tissue (Fig. 3 C). It is well documented that gizzard smooth muscle is one of the most readily available sources of the ecto-ATPase (17Stout J.G. Kirley T.L. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1994; 29: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 30Cunningham H.B. Yazaki P.J. Domingo R.C. Oades K.V. Bohlen H. Sabbadini R.A. Dahms A.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and enzymology studies have determined that the protein is a membrane bound extracellular protein. However, in vivo immunolocalization of the protein still remains undetermined. Additionally, in contrast to previous data (19Stout J.G. Strobel R.S. Kirley T.L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 36: 529-535PubMed Google Scholar), immunoblots with MC18 suggested that an ecto-apyrase-like protein was present in gizzard membranes (Fig. 2,lane 3). To study the distribution of both proteins in the gizzard we used immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. In frozen cryosections of gizzard smooth muscle, binding of mAb 15, specific for the ecto-ATPase, was observed as foci restricted to the sarcolemma of the smooth muscle cells (Fig. 3 A). This pattern suggested that the protein is found in clusters rather than being randomly distributed throughout the cell membrane. Faint, diffuse staining was also observed throughout vascular smooth muscle cells. No staining with mAb 15 was detected in the connective tissue bands. Immunocytochemcial staining with MC18, the anti-ecto-apyrase antibody, was absent in the chicken gizzard tissue (Fig. 3 B). The chicken stomach (proventriculus) is a secretory organ characterized by numerous concentrically arranged glandular papilla and ducts of oxyntico-peptic cells separated by septa of connective tissue, smooth muscle, and blood vessels. The glandular region is encased by the submucosa and a triple layer of smooth muscle (Fig.4 C). Stout et al.(19Stout J.G. Strobel R.S. Kirley T.L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 36: 529-535PubMed Google Scholar) determined in immunoperoxidase experiments that the distribution of the stomach ecto-apyrase is localized to the apical membranes of the oxyntico-peptic cells, suggesting that the protein is involved in secretory processes. We have observed an identical distribution in this study. In cryosections containing both the glandular region and the outer smooth muscle layers (Fig. 4 C), diffuse staining with MC 18 was localized in the apical membrane associated with or near the lumen of ducts (Fig. 4 A, lower left corner). We also examined the distribution of ecto-ATPase in serial cryosections of the approximate region in which MC18 binding was examined. Staining with mAb 15 was observed only in the circular smooth muscle layer that surrounds the glands (Fig. 4 B, upper right corner) and in the smooth muscle found between the tubular glands, but not in glandular cells (Fig. 4 A). As in the gizzard (Fig. 3 A), mAb 15 staining is observed as discrete spots in the cell membrane of the smooth muscle cells. In control experiments, the primary antibody was omitted, and the cryosections were exposed to only the secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse IgG-TRITC. In both chicken gizzard (Fig. 3 D) and stomach tissues (Fig. 4 D), no staining was detected (black panels), demonstrating that the secondary antibody did not react nonspecifically with chicken tissue. In previous studies by Strobel and collaborators (20Strobel R.S. Nagy A.K. Knowles A.F. Buegel J. Rosenberg M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16323-16331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 29Strobel R. Rosenberg M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 671: 487-489Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the chicken oviductal ecto-apyrase was purified to homogeneity by lectin, ion exchange, and immunoaffinity chromatography. Those investigators determined that MC18, also used in this study, was not a viable choice for immunopurification experiments because purified ecto-apyrase could not be dissociated from the antibody-antigen complex in an active form. Therefore, isolation of the chicken stomach ecto-apyrase in this study was based on previous strategies developed while purifying the ecto-ATPase from chicken gizzard and rabbit T-tubule membranes (17Stout J.G. Kirley T.L. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1994; 29: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Treuheit M.J. Vaghy P.L. Kirley T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11777-11782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific Mg-ATPase activity of chicken stomach membranes isolated as described above was 800 μmol of Pi/mg of protein/h. Solubilization in digitonin resulted in only a 65% recovery of protein and activity, but this is the detergent of choice because it (unlike many other detergents) has no adverse effects on activity. Stomach glycoproteins were isolated by concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B. Bound glycoproteins were eluted with 300 mmmethyl-α-d-mannopyranoside and resulted in a 2-fold purification (Table I).Table IPurification of the chicken stomach ecto-ATPDase (apyrase)FractionTotal proteinATPase specific activityATPase total unitsADPase specific activityADPase total unitsATP/ADP ratioPurificationTotal recoverymgμmol/mg/hμmol/hμmol/mg/hμmol/h-fold%Chicken stomach membranes5080040,30019095004.21100Solubilized stomach membranes3353017,70012039004.50.744Concanavalin A2.4160038002506006.329.5Econo-Pac blue0.06013,40081020001206.8171.9Size exclusion0.02430,50073047001106.4381.8QMA Mem-Sep0.00975,20068011,2001006.7941.7 Open table in a new tab The nucleotide-binding glycoproteins were isolated by loading the sample onto a Bio-Rad Econo-Pac Cibacron blue dye column."

The DNA binding domain (BD) of yeast Gal4 fusion to the LBD of TRα1 had no transcriptional activity on its own, but when it was coexpressed with the activation domain (AD) of yeast Gal4 fusion to LBD of RXRα conferred activation to a reporter gene harboring a Gal4 binding site, indicating that LBDs of TRα1 and RXRα interact with each other in solution. Furthermore, T3 and 9-cis-RA increased the reporter activity, and an additive effect was observed when both ligands were added, indicating that the TRα1·RXRα heterodimerization is augmented by their respective ligands in vivo. Using anin vitro pull-down experiment, we confirmed the ligand-dependent interaction observed in the yeast system. Matrix-bound glutathione S-transferase-RXRα specifically coprecipitated the 35S-labeled TRα1 above the control, and associated 35S-labeled TRα1 was increased by the addition of T3 and 9-cis-RA. These results imply a complex, sensitive cross-talk in vivo among nuclear receptors and their respective ligands through distinct hormonal signaling pathways. The thyroid hormone receptors (TR) bind to cis-acting DNA elements as heterodimers with the retinoid X receptors (RXR). These heterodimers display distinct specificities in mediating the hormonal response to target gene transcription. We characterized the interaction between TRα1 and RXRα via their ligand binding domains (LBDs) and the effect of ligands on the interaction using a yeast two-hybrid system. The DNA binding domain (BD) of yeast Gal4 fusion to the LBD of TRα1 had no transcriptional activity on its own, but when it was coexpressed with the activation domain (AD) of yeast Gal4 fusion to LBD of RXRα conferred activation to a reporter gene harboring a Gal4 binding site, indicating that LBDs of TRα1 and RXRα interact with each other in solution.

Based on sequence homology and functional analysis, the nuclear receptors exhibit a modular structure with functionally separable domains. Members of the superfamily are characterized by a highly conserved cysteine-rich DNA binding domain containing two zinc finger structures necessary for sequence-specific DNA interaction (7Evans R.M. Hollenberg S.M. Cell. 1988; 52: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The complex carboxyl-terminal region of the receptors contains ligand binding, receptor dimerization, and putative transcriptional activation functions (8Carson J.M. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 201-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). The TRs, as well as other members of the superfamily, regulate transcription by binding to response elements containing two or more copies (often degenerate) of the consensus motif AGGTCA (9Brent G.A.

Recently it was shown that RARs, TRs, vitamin D receptors, and PPARs form heterodimers with the RXRs on bipartite hormone response elements composed of nonsymmetrical head-to-tail tandem AGGTCA half-sites (11Yu V.C. Delsert C. Andersen B. Holloway J.M. Devary O.V. Näär A.M. Kim S.Y. Boutin J.-M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

To date two distinct dimerization surfaces were proposed in the DNA binding domain (DBD) and ligand binding domain (LBD) of TR. The surface in the DNA binding domain conferred selective power in DNA-dependent dimer formation (14Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the interface within the DBDs, dimerization motifs in the LBDs permit the heterodimeric complex subsequently to interact with response elements. The carboxyl-terminal LBD is responsible for DNA-independent dimerization that in vitro allows performation of certain dimers in solution before DNA targeting. This dimerization function is believed to stabilize the complex and promote the recognition of DNA. Several heptad repeats in LBD are well conserved among the members of the erbA-related nuclear receptor family and have been proposed to form a hydrophobic surface that might act as a receptor dimerization interface (15Forman B.M. Yang C.R. Au M. Casanova J. Ghysdael J. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1610-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 16Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6326) Google Scholar), which is structurally similar to the leucine zipper dimerization domain found in Jun-Fos (17Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). The heterodimerization influences the recognition of DNA targets and confers specificity for a defined spacing between two directly repeating hexameric sequences. Deletion of heptad repeats abolished the trans-activation function of the receptor (18Glass C.K. Lipkin S.M. Devary O.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1989; 59: 697-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 19Holloway J.M. Glass C.K. Adler S. Nelson C.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8160-8164Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the formation of heterodimers results in cross-talk among different ligands potentially to affect a range of physiological processes. The effect of ligand on the formation of TR·RXR heterodimers in solution has not been demonstrated clearly. To investigate the role of ligand in the process of receptor dimerization before binding to the target DNA, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system that allows the measurement of specific protein-protein interaction in solution. In the present study, we demonstrated that TR/RXR interaction occurred in solution before DNA targeting and was augmented by T3 and 9-cis-RA additively both in vivo and in vitro. The genotype of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae reporter strain SFY526 is MATa, ura3–52, his3–200, ade2–101, lys2–801, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, canr, gal4–542, gal80–538, URA3::GAL1-lacZ (obtained fromCLONTECH). The genotype of HF7c strain is MATa, ura3–52, his3–200, lys2–801, ade2–101, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, gal4–542, gal80–538, LYS2::GAL1-HIS3::URA3::(GAL4 17-mers)3-CYC1-lacZ (obtained from CLONTECH). Both yeast host strains carry a lacZ reporter gene under the control of GAL4 binding site. HF7C contains a second reporter gene (HIS3), also under the control of GAL4 response elements. Yeast strains were grown at 30 °C in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-Peptone, 2% dextrose) or in synthetic selection medium with appropriate supplements. Gal4BD fusion proteins were expressed by transfecting pGBT9 (CLONTECH) vector harboring the cDNA encompassed TRα1 LBD (amino acids 120–410), or RXRα LBD (amino acids 200–461) (Fig.1). The pGBT9-TRα1(LBD) (amino acids 120–410) and pGBT9-RXRα(LBD) (amino acids 200–461) plasmids were constructed by inserting the cDNA sequence encompassing the hinge and the LBD of human TRα1 or RXRα (20Mangelsdorf D.J. Ong E.S. Dyck J.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1990; 345: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar) intoBamHI-SalI sites orEcoRI-BglII sites of pGBT9, respectively. To introduce the EcoRI and BamHI sites into 5′- and 3′-ends of the LBD of TRα1, pMe21 (4Nakai A. Sakurai A. Bell G.I. DeGroot L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1087-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which contains the entire coding region of hTRα1 cDNA, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using following synthetic oligonucleotide primers: 5′-ggatccgtATGGCCATGGACTTGGTTCT-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-gtcgacTTAGACTTCCTGATCCTCAA-3′ (reverse primer). The forward primer contains the BamHI site (ggatcc) and an additional 2 base pairs (gt) to adjust the reading frame followed by the coding strand sequence just after DBD of hTRα1. The reverse primer includes theSalI site (gtcgac) and the coding sequence at the carboxyl terminus of hTRα1. The hinge and LBD of hRXRα were amplified by PCR using following forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers: 5′-gaattcATGAAGCGGGAAGCCGTGCA-3′ and 5′-agatctCTAAGTCATTTGGTGCGGC-3′, containing EcoRI (gaattc) and BglII (agatct) sites, respectively. Standard PCR conditions were used. The sequences of the PCR products were verified by sequencing. The resulting plasmids express the hinge and LBD of hTRα1(120–410) or hRXRα(200–461) as a fusion protein to the DBD of Gal4 transcription factor (BD-TRα1(LBD) and BD-RXRα(LBD)). For construction of expression plasmids for BD-TRβ1(LBD) (amino acids 174–461) and their mutant receptors, EcoRI-BamHI sites of the pGBT9 were used as a cloning site. The hinge and LBD (amino acids 174–461) of human TRβ1 cDNA were amplified by PCR using following forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers: 5′-gaattcATGAAGCGGGAAGCCGTGCA-3′ and 5′-agatctCTAAGTCATTTGGTGCGGC-3′, containing EcoRI (gaattc) and BglII (agatct) sites, respectively. pGAD424 (CLONTECH) was used for the expression vector for the Gal4 activation domain (AD)-TRα1 LBD or RXRα LBD fusion protein, pGAD424-TRα1(LBD) and pGAD424-RXRα(LBD). The BamHI and SalI insert from pGBT9-TRα1(LBD) or EcoRI and BglII fragment from pGBT9-RXRα(LBD) were inserted intoBamHI-SalI sites andEcoRI-BglII sites of pGAD424 in-frame, respectively. Resulting plasmids express the hinge and LBD of hTRα1(120–410) or hRXRα(200–461) as a fusion protein to the AD of Gal4 transcription factor (AD-TRα1(LBD) and AD-RXRα(LBD)). Yeast expression vector, which lacks the Gal4AD, pRXRα(LBD), was generated by replacing the KpnI-EcoRI fragment, which contains the Gal4AD sequence of the wild type pGAD424-RXRα(LBD) with synthetic oligonucleotides in-frame. Oligonucleotides used were 5′-CGCCGCCTCTAGAGAGATCG-3′ (sense) and 5′-AATT CGATCTCTCTAGAGGCGGCGGTAC-3′ (antisense). The nuclear localization signal was not removed in the above procedures. β-Galactosidase activity, which was the product of the lacZ reporter gene, was used to indicate the interaction between the two hybrid proteins in vivo, which reconstitutes Gal4 function. Recombinant strains were grown overnight at 30 °C in 5 ml of synthetic medium lacking leucine and tryptophan to select for the maintenance of plasmids. The yeast cultures were initially diluted to an A 600 nmof 0.05 and incubated in the presence of various concentrations of T3 and/or 9-cis-RA at 30 °C overnight in separate tubes. The A 600 nm was determined. 700 μl of Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0) was added to 0.1 ml of culture. The cells in the reaction mixtures were permeabilized by adding 50 μl of 0.1% SDS and 50 μl of chloroform and vortex vigorously for 30 s. The reaction were started with the addition of 0.16 ml of chloroform red-β-galactopyranoside (CPRG) (4 mg/ml) at 30 °C and stopped by adding 0.5 ml of 3 mm ZnCl2, and theA 570 nm was read. β-Galactosidase activity was determined with the values at A 570 nm andA 600 nm using the equation U = (1,000 × A 570 nm)/(v ×t × A 600 nm), wheret is the time of reaction (min), and v is the volume of yeast culture used in the reaction mixture (ml) (21Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). To express the fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST), PCR-amplified full-length RXRα cDNA was inserted in-frame into BamHI and EcoRI cloning sites of the pGEX-2T vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The following oligonucleotides were used to amplify the full-length hRXRα: 5′-agatctcatATGGACACCAAACATTTCCTG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-gaattcTAAGTCATTTGGTGCGGC-3′ (reverse primer). Overnight cultures of Escherichia coli JM109 carrying the recombinant GST-RXRα and GST control plasmid were diluted 100-fold, cultured for 5–6 h, and then induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After another 3 h, bacteria were collected and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Pellets were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and sonicated. Debris was removed by centrifugation. The fusion protein or the GST control protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia) and washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Matrix-bound proteins were used for interaction experiments. 35S-Labeled TRα1 protein was produced by in vitro translation (Promega TNT, Madison, WI) using a T7 expression vector containing full-length TRα1 cDNA (pET TRα1) (22Miyamoto T. Sakurai A. DeGroot L.J. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 3027-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In vitro translated35S-labeled TRα1 (1–2 μl) was incubated for 20 min at room temperature with glutathione-Sepharose (10 μl) preloaded with GST-RXRα fusion or GST control protein in 250 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmleupeptin, 1 mm pepstatin) in the presence or absence of 10−6m T3 and/or 9-cis-RA. After extensive washing with binding buffer, bound proteins were eluted in 25 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 10 min, and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%) followed by autoradiography. The results of the in vitroreactions and the amount of 35S-labeled protein bound by GST or GST-RXRα were visualized and quantified using a PhosphoImager (Fuji BAS 1500). To investigate the ability of TRα1 and RXRα to heterodimerize through their LBD, the interaction of Gal4BD-TRα1(LBD) and Gal4AD-RXRα(LBD) fusion proteins in yeasts was examined using the yeast two-hybrid system. The yeast reporter strain HF7c was cotransformed with pGBT9-TRα1(LBD) or pGAD424-RXRα(LBD) or both plasmids and selected with tryptophan and leucine dropout medium. Transformed colonies were streaked onto tryptophan and leucine dropout medium with or without histidine. In this assay, the formation of a complex between TRα1(LBD) fused to Gal4BD and RXRα(LBD) fused to Gal4AD confers histidine auxotrophy and β-galactosidase activity. As shown in Fig. 2, the yeasts expressing Gal4BD-TRα1(LBD) and Gal4AD-RXRα(LBD) are allowed to grow in the absence of histidine. The yeast cotransformed with pairs of Gal4BD-TRα1(LBD) and Gal4AD, or Gal4BD and Gal4AD-RXRα(LBD), did not permit growth in the absence of histidine, indicating that histidine auxotrophy is the result of the interaction between TRα1(LBD) and RXRα(LBD). Similar results were obtained in the reverse experiment using cotransformants expressing Gal4BD-RXRα(LBD) and Gal4AD-TRα1(LBD) (data not shown). First, we examine the ligand-dependent transcriptional activity of Gal4BD-TRα1(LBD) or Gal4BD-RXRα(LBD) alone (Fig.3). pGBT9-TRα1(LBD) or pGBT9-RXRα(LBD) was introduced into SFY526 yeast strain to express Gal4BD-TRα1(LBD) or Gal4BD-RXRα(LBD) protein. Yeast colonies were selected with tryptophan dropout medium. Five independent yeast colonies were cultured overnight in the absence or presence of T3 (10−6m) and/or 9-cis-RA (10−6m), and β-galactosidase activities were determined. No increase of β-galactosidase activity was observed in the yeasts transformed with Gal4BD-TRα1(LBD) or Gal4BD-RXRα(LBD) expressing vector. T3 or 9-cis-RA did not show a significant increase of β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 3). The LBD of TRα1 or RXRα cannot function as a transcriptional activator even in the presence of ligands in the yeasts. Neither Gal4BD-TRα1(LBD) nor Gal4BD-RXRα(LBD) alone activates the transcription of GAL1promoter. Then we tested the ability of the heterodimers between LBDs of TR and RXR as a transcriptional activator for Gal4 DBD. pRXRα(LBD), just an expression vector for RXRα(LBD), was cointroduced into SFY526 with pGBT9-TRα1(LBD). No increase of β-galactosidase activity was observed in the yeasts transformed with Gal4BD-TRα1(LBD) and RXRα(LBD) expressing vector, and T3 or 9-cis-RA did not show a significant increase of β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 3). It is concluded, therefore, that the heterodimers of LBDs of TR and RXR cannot function as a transcriptional activator in the yeasts. When a combination of Gal4BD-TRα1(LBD) and Gal4AD-RXRα(LBD), or Gal4BD-RXRα(LBD) and Gal4AD-TRα1(LBD), were introduced into yeast strain SFY526, a significant increase in β-galactosidase activities was observed. Both T3 and 9-cis-RA increased the β-galactosidase activity, and an additive effect was observed when both ligands were present. Dose dependence of ligands for activation of TR/RXR interaction was assessed. Yeast colonies were cultured overnight in the presence of various concentration of T3 or 9-cis-RA. As shown in Fig. 4, T3 and 9-cis-RA increased the β-galactosidase activity in a dose-dependent manner. A half-maximal increase was observed at 10−7m for T3 and 10−6m for 9-cis-RA. We examined further the effect of 9-cis-RA (10−6m) on the T3-dependent TR/RXR interaction. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the presence of T3 further activated the β-galactosidase activity without changing the sensitivity to 9-cis-RA. In Fig. 5 B, the reverse experiments were performed to show the T3dose-response curve in the presence or absence of 10−6m T3. Similarly, the presence of 9-cis-RA further activated the β-galactosidase activity without changing the sensitivity to T3. All fusion proteins were expressed at approximately the same level in the transformed yeasts, as determined by ligand binding assay (data not shown). The above results were also verified by cotransforming the yeast host strain HF7c with the two hybrid vectors. In HF7c, the lacZreporter gene is under the control of a promoter different from that used to control the lacZ gene in SFY526. These two promoter share only GAL4 response elements in common; the rest of the promoter sequences differ significantly.Figure 5Additive effects of T3 and 9-cis-RA on the TRα1(LBD)/RXRα(LBD) interaction. A combination of pGBT9-TRα1(LBD) (BD-TRα) and pGAD424-RXRα(LBD) (AD-RXRα) was introduced into yeast SFY526 and selected with tryptophan and leucine dropout medium. Yeast colonies were cultured overnight in the presence of various concentrations of T3 with or without 9-cis-RA (10−6m) (panel A) or in the presence of various concentrations of 9-cis-RA with or without T3 (10−6m) (panel B). β-Galactosidase activities were determined using CPRG (“Materials and Methods”). Values are the mean ± S.D. for at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next tested the effect of T3 analogs on activating the BD-TRα1(LBD)·AD-RXRα(LBD) complex. As shown in Fig.6, the order of potency of each analog to induce β-galactosidase activity is consistent with previously determined affinity constant of binding of the ligands to the TR (23Schueler P.A. Schwartz H.L. Strait K.A. Mariash C.N. Oppenheimer J.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Half-maximal activation was obtained at 10−8mfor Triac, 10−7m for L-T3, D-T3, and 10−6m for L-T4 (Triac < L-T3 < D-T3 < L-T4). These compounds did not affect the growth property of the yeasts. The GST-RXRα fusion protein was used to investigate the effects of ligands on the interaction between the LBD of RXR and TR in vitro. Complexes with GST-RXRα were retained on glutathione-Sepharose, the beads were washed and pulled down by centrifugation, and associated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. TRα1 was labeled with [35S]methionine by in vitrotranslation and incubated with GST (Fig.7, upper panel, second lane) or a GST-RXR fusion protein (third throughsixth lanes) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, as indicated. 35S-Labeled TRα1 was specifically retained in the presence of GST-RXRα but did not bind to the GST control protein (second lane). Approximately 7.5% of the total input of TRα1 was specifically bound to the GST-RXR fusion protein. Addition of T3 or 9-cis-RA increased the amount of35S-labeled TRα1 that associated with GST-RXRα, and further increase was observed when both ligands were present. We next investigated the ability of TRβ1(LBD) to interact with RXRα(LBD). Similar to the results with TRα1 and RXRα, both ligand-independent (constitutive) and ligand-induced interactions were observed with TRβ1 and RXRα (Fig.8). In addition, we also examined the heterodimerizing properties of specific mutant receptors, TRβ1(G345R) and TRβ1∧422, to compare ligand-dependent transcriptional activity with their heterodimerizing activity. TRβ1(G345R), which was isolated from a patient with resistance to thyroid hormone (24Sakurai A. Miyamoto T. Refetoff S. DeGroot L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 4: 1988-1994Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar), has no detectable T3 binding activity because of a glycine to arginine substitution at amino acid 345 in the hormone binding domain. TRβ1∧422 is an artificial mutant receptor with 4 amino acids insertion in the 9th heptad region, which is known to be essential for heterodimerization with RXR (18Glass C.K. Lipkin S.M. Devary O.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1989; 59: 697-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The ligand binding-defective mutant TRβ1(G345R) revealed the constitutive and 9-cis-RA-induced interaction but did not show the T3-induced interaction. Heterodimerization-defective mutant TRβ1∧422 failed to support both constitutive- and ligand-induced interaction in the yeasts (Fig. 8). The TRs are believed to function as heterodimers with RXR and exert their physiological activities through binding to the thyroid hormone response elements in DNA (16Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6326) Google Scholar). Dimerization of receptors through the specific interfaces that exist in the LBD has been demonstrated for the glucocorticoid receptor, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor (26Kumar V.

To examine in detail the interaction between TR and RXR in solution and the effect of their ligands in vivo, we have established the yeast two-hybrid system as an in vivo approach to analyze the heterodimerization between the LBD of TR and RXR. In this report, we provide evidence that the TRs are able to heterodimerize with RXR in the absence of DNA, and T3 and 9-cis-RA augment this interaction in vivo, supporting the physiological importance of the heterodimer formation in solution. LBDs of TRα1 and RXRα act as transcriptional regulators in mammalian cells when fused to the heterologous DBD of the transcription factors (29Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1996; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to know whether Gal4BD-TRα1(LBD) or Gal4BD-RXRα(LBD) alone can activate the reporter gene in a ligand-dependent manner in the yeast system. If the ligand-induced activity of the reporter gene could be caused by activation of Gal4BD-TRα1(LBD) or Gal4BD-RXRα(LBD) by the ligands, the activities of the reporter gene do not exactly reflect the interaction of the two proteins. In Fig. 3, we showed that neither of Gal4BD-TRα1(LBD) nor Gal4BD-RXRα(LBD) alone activates the reporter gene, irrespective of the presence of ligands. Moreover, using pRXRα(LBD), which lacks Gal4AD, we further analyzed the capability of the TRα(LBD)·RXRα(LBD) heterodimer to function as a ligand-dependent transcriptional activator in the yeasts. As shown in Fig. 3, a combination of Gal4BD-TRα1 and RXRα(LBD) did not activate the reporter gene even in the presence of ligands. These results indicate that neither TRα1(LBD) alone nor a combination of TRα1(LBD) and RXRα(LBD) confers ligand-dependent activation to the reporter gene in the yeast system. Therefore, it is concluded that the activity of the reporter gene indicates the reconstitution of the Gal4 molecule, allowing the measurement of the strength of interaction between TRα1(LBD) and RXRα(LBD). Because the yeast two-hybrid system is extremely sensitive and can detect very transient interactions, we utilized the in vitropull-down experiment as a second more stringent assay to confirm the ligand-induced heterodimerization seen in the yeast system. As shown in Fig. 7, it is demonstrated that the dimerization can occur in solution and that it is augmented by ligands in a pull-down experiment using the bacterially expressed RXRα fused to GST. It has been shown in mammalian systems that cotransfection of a Gal4-RXR expression vector and an expression vector for the LBD of the TR can confer T3 responsiveness to a promoter containing a Gal4 binding site (29Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1996; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (567) Google Scholar). This experiment indicates that TR/RXR can form functional heterodimers in vivo in the absence of DBDs. Our results in the yeast system are consistent with the reported data in mammalian systems. In addition, augmentation of the TR/RXR interaction by T3 analogs correlated with the biological potency and ligand affinity of thyroid hormone analogs (Triac > T3 > T4), suggesting a physiological importance of ligand-induced heterodimerization in solution. In mammalian cells, the enhancement of T3-dependent reporter gene activation by TR·RXR heterodimers is well established, and the binding of TR to thyroid hormone response elements is much more efficient in the presence of RXR. Herein, we provide more direct evidence that TR and RXR form heterodimers before DNA targeting in vivo, and ligand binding clearly enhances receptor associations with each other. Previous studies have shown that ligand binding induced conformational change in TR in solution (30Ichikawa K. Hashizume K. Miyamoto T. Nishii Y. Yamauchi K. Ohtsuka H. Yamada T. J.

Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar) and TRα (33Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. McGrath M.E. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar) crystallized in the presence of their respective ligands revealed that helix 12 was aligned over the ligand binding pocket, in contrast to its position in unliganded receptors, in which it protrudes away from the LBD. In liganded receptors, hydrophobic residues within helix 12 face toward the pocket, perhaps contacting the ligand, whereas the negatively charged residues are exposed on the protein surface. Thus, as suggested by Renaud et al. (34Renaud J.P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar), realignment of helix 12 over the ligand binding pocket when the receptor binds ligand may generate a novel surface for interaction with the partner proteins or bridging proteins. Ligand binding seems to stabilize protein-protein interactions that lead to high affinity DNA binding and trans-activation. Although it is clear that ligand induces conformational change in the DNA-bound receptors, the precise molecular mechanism by which the TRs regulate transcription in response to the binding of ligands remain enigmatic. Ligand-dependent heterodimerization of TR and RXR is involved, at least in part, in the ligand-induced gene activation. It has been suggested recently that the DBD of TR and RXR can bind to a thyroid hormone response element sequence as a heterodimer in vitro, and a dimer interface found in the DBD has selective power for recognition of specific DNA interaction (36Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we demonstrated that DNA binding is not necessary for heterodimer formation via the surface of the LBD, suggesting that several domains cooperate for forming heterodimers on target DNA in vivo. These results are consistent with the two-step hypothesis for binding of heterodimers to DNA (37Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2837) Google Scholar). In the first step, TR would form solution heterodimers with RXR through their LBDs. In the second step, the DBDs, by virtue of their proximity, would be able to bind a high affinity site in DNA. Once bound to DNA, the receptors are capable of modulating transcription. Since RXR plays a central role in mediating many hormonal signals, including retinoids, thyroid hormone, vitamin D3, and peroxisome proliferator activators, ligand (T3)-induced heterodimerization leads to an influence on other nuclear receptor signaling by squelching out the common partner, RXR. Recently, Chuet al. (25Chu R. Madison L.D. Lin Y. Kopp P. Rao M.S. Jameson J.L. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11593-11597Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) reported that TR inhibits PPAR signaling by squelching out RXR. They observed that T3 enhances the inhibition of PPAR activity by TR. Our results explain this phenomenon well, because T3 increases the number of TR·RXR heterodimers, resulting in a decrease in the number of active PPAR·RXR heterodimers. Recently the apparent hormone dependence was observed in an estrogen receptor dimerization experiment (26Kumar V. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 55: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). Wang et al. (35Wang H. Peters G.A. Zeng X. Tang M. Ip W. Khan S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23322-23329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) studied extensively estrogen receptor homodimerization using a yeast two-hybrid system. A particularly useful feature of the yeast two-hybrid system is the ability to study the heterodimerization activity of the various receptor forms. It would be interesting to analyze solution interaction among nuclear receptors including orphan receptors. This approach may lead to an understanding the role of ligand in transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors. We thank Dr. R. M.

Protein fragments encoding amino acids Val143 to Val411 (rFbgγC30) or Val143 to Leu427 (γ′C30) from the carboxyl end of the γ or γ′ chains, respectively, of human fibrinogen were expressed in yeast (Pichia pastoris) and characterized as to their cross-linking by factor XIIIa, polymerization pocket, and calcium-binding site. rFbgγC30 and γ′C30 were both readily cross-linked by factor XIIIa, but only rFbgγC30 was capable of inhibiting thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Two mutants, γC30-Q329R and γC30-D364A, which were based on the three-dimensional structure of the polymerization pocket within rFbgγC30 and on information derived from naturally occurring mutant fibrinogens, were also expressed and characterized. rFbgγC30 inhibited (desAA)fibrin polymerization in a dose-dependent manner, while the two mutant forms did not. Similarly, rFbgγC30 and γ′C30 were protected from plasmin degradation by the presence of Ca2+ or the peptide Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro, indicating that a functional Ca2+-binding site and polymerization pocket are contained within each of these fragments. The mutant fragments, however, were protected from plasmin only by metal ions, while no protective effect was conferred by GPRP or by any other peptide tested. These results indicate that the polymerization pocket “a”, which binds the peptide GPRP, functions independently from the nearby calcium-binding site and that amino acids Gln329 and Asp364 play a crucial role in fibrin polymerization.

Fibrinogen is a large glycoprotein composed of six polypeptide chains (α, β, γ)2 held together by disulfide bonds. By electron microscopy, the molecule appears as a trinodular structure (1Fowler W.E. Erickson H.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 134: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) in which the central nodule contains the amino termini of all six chains (2Blombäck B. Blombäck M. Henschen A. Hessel B. Iwanaga S. Woods K.R. Nature. 1968; 218: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The two distal nodules contain the carboxyl-terminal regions of the γ and β chains. Upon cleavage by thrombin, fibrinopeptides A and B are released from the amino termini of the α and β chains, resulting in fibrin monomers that polymerize spontaneously. The newly exposed amino termini constitute polymerization sites A and B that are complementary to polymerization pockets “a” and “b”, respectively (3Blombäck B. Hessel B. Hogg D. Therkildsen L.

A. 1980; 77: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The “a” pocket is located within the carboxyl region of the γ chain (7Yamazumi K. Doolittle R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 1993; 218: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), while the location of the “b” pocket remains controversial. It has been proposed to arise upon the alignment of the D domains of two fibrin molecules (6Olexa S.A. Budzynski A.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), to be contained in the carboxyl-terminal region of the β chain (9Doolittle R.F. Laudano A.P. Protides Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 22-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It also protects fibrinogen fragment D against plasmic degradation (17Haverkate F. Timan G. Thromb. Res. 1977; 10: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Fibrinogen binds three calcium ions per molecule (18Marguerie G. Chagniel G. Suscillon M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 490: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Nieuwenhuizen W. Haverkate F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 408: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), including one in the carboxyl-terminal region of each γ chain. The third calcium is present in the central nodule, provided that the α chains are intact (20Marguerie G. Ardaillou N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 701: 410-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The precise location of the calcium-binding site within the carboxyl end of the γ chain was described recently (21Yee V.C. Pratt K.P. Côté H.C.F. Le Trong I. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 125-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The calcium ion is situated within the P domain of the molecule and is liganded by two water molecules, the side chain carboxyl groups of Asp318 and Asp320, and the main chain carbonyl oxygens of Phe322 and Gly324. The location of the third calcium within the fibrinogen molecule remains unclear. Binding studies using peptide analogs that mimic the new amino termini of the α and β chains of fibrin (GPRP and GHRP, respectively) have shown that calcium also modulates the binding of GHRP to fibrinogen but does not significantly affect that of GPRP (9Doolittle R.F. Laudano A.P. Protides Biol. Fluids. 1980; 28: 311-316Google Scholar, 22Laudano A.P. Doolittle R.F. Science. 1981; 212: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Since polymerization deficiencies have been observed in fibrinogens with defective calcium binding properties and vice versa (23Ebert R.F. Index of Variant Human Fibrinogens. Organon Teknica/Biotechnology Research Institute, Rockville, MD1994Google Scholar), one could speculate that the two phenomena might be dependent on each other. Apart from its role in calcium-binding and fibrin polymerization, the γ chain of fibrinogen is involved in factor XIIIa-mediated cross-linking of the fibrin polymers to form γ-γ dimers (24Chen R. Doolittle R.F. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4486-4491Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and in binding to platelets through the cell surface receptor GPIIb/IIIa (25Kloczewiak M. Timmons S. Hawiger J. Thromb. Res. 1983; 29: 249-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The γ chain also mediates the binding of fibrin(ogen) to endothelial cells through the cell surface receptor ICAM-1 (26Altieri D.C. Duperray A. Plescia J. Thornton G.B. Languino L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 696-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and its binding to leukocytes through an interaction with the integrin MAC-1 (27Altieri D.C. Plescia J. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1847-1853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 10% of the circulating fibrinogen in normal human blood contains a γ′ chain instead of the typical γ chain (28Mosesson M.W. Finlayson J.S. Umfleet R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5223-5227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This γ′ variant chain arises by alternative processing and polyadenylation of the mRNA for the γ chain (29Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4232-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 30Fornace Jr., A.J. Cummings D.E. Comeau C.M. Kant J.A. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12826-12830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This creates a new carboxyl terminus for the γ′ chain in which the last 4 amino acids of the γ chain are replaced by a new sequence of 20 amino acids in the γ′ chain. Unlike the wild-type fibrinogen, recombinant homodimeric γ′-fibrinogen does not support platelet aggregation (31Farrell D.H. Thiagarajan P. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10729-10732Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), presumably because of an impaired interaction with the platelet fibrinogen receptor GPIIb/IIIa. In the present study, the biological properties of the recombinant wild-type carboxyl-terminal region of the γ chain of human fibrinogen (Val143–Val411) were compared with those of a similar fragment from the γ′ (Val143–Leu427) chain and with those of two site-specific mutants (Q329R and D364A). It was found that all four recombinant γ species bound calcium but that only the wild-type γ and γ′ possessed a functional polymerization pocket. This indicates that the “GPRP-binding” polymerization pocket and the “calcium-binding” site are distinct and independent from one another.

Geneticin (G418 sulfate) was from Life Technologies, Inc. The chromogenic substrate S-2238 was purchased from Helena Laboratories (Beaumont, TX). The synthetic peptides GPRPamide, GPRP, GHRP, and GGYR were purchased from Sigma, while GPRVVER, GPRVVERH, and GPRVVERHQ were synthesized by the Peptide Synthesis Facility (Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington). The human fibrinogen γ chain cDNA was isolated from pHIγ2 (32Chung D.W. Chan W.-Y. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3250-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The 5′- and 3′-ends were modified using polymerase chain reaction to create restriction sites suitable for subcloning into the pPIC9k vector (kindly provided by Dr. Michael Romanos, Wellcome Laboratories, UK). For γC30-Q329R and γC30-D364A, single amino acid substitutions were incorporated by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (33Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). For the γ′C30 construct, the γ′ 3′-cDNA sequence was incorporated into the 3′-oligonucleotide used for polymerase chain reaction. All expression vector inserts were verified by DNA sequence analysis. The construct was transformed into the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris (strain GS115 or SMD1168) by electroporation, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Selected His+ colonies were screened further for high copy number by G418 selection as described by Scorer et al. (34Scorer C.A. Clare J.J. McCombie W.R. Romanos M.A. Sreekrishna K. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The yeast clone that grew fastest on G418 was chosen for protein expression. For large scale protein production, an overnight 20-ml culture was used to inoculate 2 × 500 ml of BMGY (100 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base, 4 × 10−5% biotin, 1% glycerol) in 2-liter baffled flasks, which were cultured at 30 °C, 275 rpm for 2 days. For medium exchange, the cells were recovered by centrifugation (4200 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and gently resuspended in BMMY (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1% yeast extract, 4% peptone, 1% casamino acids, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base, 4 × 10−5% biotin, 0.5% methanol) in 4 × 500 ml, in 2-liter baffled flasks covered with sterile gauze for maximal aeration. The cultures were fed 0.8% methanol twice a day for 3–4 days. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (12,200 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and the protein was purified from the supernatant. The culture supernatant was subjected to 55% ammonium sulfate, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 mmMES, pH 6.0, containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NEM, 0.5 mg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mg/ml pepstatin A. After extensive dialysis in 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, the sample was subjected to cation exchange chromatography on a Pharmacia Source 15S column equilibrated in the same buffer. The protein was eluted with a shallow 0–100 mm NaCl gradient, and fractions containing the γC30 proteins were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and concentrated using Ultrafree-4 centrifugal filter devices (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Human fibrinogen was treated with 1 mm NEM and then dialyzed against 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. The protein was then diluted to 4.5 mg/ml in 10 ml of the same buffer containing 5 mmCaCl2 and subjected to plasmin digest (0.04 units/ml, final concentration) for 2 h at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of aprotinin (10 mg/ml final concentration). Fragment D was separated from fragment E by anion exchange chromatography on a Pharmacia Mono Q column in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, eluted with a NaCl gradient in the same buffer. The fractions containing fragment D were pooled, and the protein was precipitated with 80% ammonium sulfate. The protein pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl and loaded onto a gel filtration column (Superdex 200, Pharmacia) equilibrated and developed in the same buffer. An extinction coefficient (E 0.1%) of 2.0 and a molecular mass of 95 kDa were used for the determination of fragment D concentration. All proteins were subjected to amino-terminal sequence analysis using an Applied Biosystems 447A protein sequencer. An extinction coefficient (E 0.1%) of 2.2 was determined for rFbgγC30 by amino acid analysis on a sample of pure protein of knownA 280. The same extinction coefficient was used for the other γ species. Mass spectroscopy was performed either by Dr. J. Hoffman (Zymogenetics, Seattle, WA) or at the UW Mass Spectroscopy Facility (Dept. of Biochemistry, University of Washington). Human fibrinogen was treated with 1 mm NEM to inactivate any trace of FXIIIa, dialyzed against 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. The clotting reaction, taking place in a cuvette, in 1 ml of the same buffer containing 1.0 μm fibrinogen (0.34 mg/ml) and 5 mmCaCl2, was initiated by the addition of the snake venom protein batroxobin (0.001 units/ml, final concentration). The course of the reaction was followed by measuring the turbidity at 340 nm every 2 s for 20 min, using a 8452A diode array spectrophotometer (Hewlett Packard). Various amounts of rFbgγC30, fragment D, bovine serum albumin, and mutant γC30 proteins were added to the reaction in the same buffer. Fibrinopeptide A concentration was measured in the fibrinogen clot supernatants by competitive enzyme-linked immunoassay, using the Asserachrom FPA kit from Diagnostica Stago (Asnières-sur-Seine, France), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The proteins were diluted to 1 mg/ml in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. For the plasmin protection experiments using metal ions, the samples were treated with 0.5 mm EGTA to eliminate any trace of calcium from the protein preparation, after which 5 mm of CaCl2, MgCl2, ZnCl2, MnCl2, or TbCl3 was added. For the plasmin protection experiments with peptides, the samples all contained 5 mm EDTA with and without 5 mm peptide (GPRPamide, GPRP, GHRP, GGYR (an unrelated peptide), GPRVVER, GPRVVERH, and GPRVVERHQ). The assays, performed at 37 °C, were initiated by the addition of human plasmin (0.02 units/ml, final concentration). At various times, an aliquot was withdrawn, and the reaction was stopped by mixing with EDTA (10 mm) and SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15% gel) stained with Coomassie Blue. The protein band corresponding to the undigested fragment was quantitated by scanning densitometry using an AlphaImager 2000 (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). No digestion was observed when plasmin was omitted, whether in the presence of Ca2+ or EDTA. rFbgγC30 was diluted to 1 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA. Human plasmin was added at 0.02 units/ml, and aliquots were withdrawn at various times for SDS-PAGE and amino-terminal sequence analysis. For fragment D, the protein was diluted to 3 mg/ml in the same buffer, and plasmin was added at 0.2 units/ml. At 0, 1, and 16 h, aliquots were withdrawn for SDS-PAGE in duplicate. The fragments on one gel were stained with Coomassie Blue, and those on the other gel were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) for amino-terminal sequencing. Factor XIII (1.5 mg/ml in 20 mm sodium borate buffer, pH 7.5, 3 mm CaCl2) was activated with human thrombin (approximately 74 μg/ml) for 5 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition ofd-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethylketone, HCl at 5 mg/ml. No residual thrombin was detected by the hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate S-2238. rFbgγC30 was diluted at 7 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and factor XIIIa was added at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The reaction proceeded at room temperature, with gentle rocking, for 20 h. An aliquot was withdrawn at various times and mixed with EDTA (10 mm) and SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples were analyzed on a 10% gel stained with Coomassie Blue. Blood (50 ml) was freshly drawn from a healthy male volunteer and was anticoagulated with citrate. The platelets were prepared as described before (35Côté H.C.F. Bajzar L. Stevens W.K. Samis J.A. Morser J. MacGillivray R.T.A. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6194-6200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The platelet preparation was resuspended in a total volume of 1.5 ml. Platelet aggregation was measured by following the light transmittance using a PACKS-4 Platelet Aggregation Chromogenic Kinetic System (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX). Each aggregation assay was performed at 37 °C, in a final volume of 250 μl, with stirring and contained 150 μl of platelets, 5 mm CaCl2, and various amounts of rFbgγC30 or γ′C30 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 20 nm human thrombin. The carboxyl-terminal region of the γ chain of human fibrinogen (rFbgγC30), encompassing residues Val143–Val411, was expressed and secreted from the yeast P. pastoris at levels of approximately 100 mg/liter. The nonglycosylated recombinant fragment was purified by cation exchange chromatography and migrated as a single band when subjected to SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 A). Peak I shown in Fig.1 A was employed in all subsequent experiments with rFbgγC30. The 30-kDa protein showed the expected amino-terminal amino acid sequence of VQIHDITG. Mass spectroscopic analysis of rFbgγC30 purified in the absence of protease inhibitors, however, revealed that it was partially degraded at the carboxyl terminus. This degradation occurred predominantly past His400. Subsequently, the addition of several protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, NEM, aprotinin, and pepstatin A) during the purification procedure allowed the isolation of full-length nonproteolyzed protein. The use of the carboxypeptidase-deficient yeast strain SMD1168 also appeared to improve the overall quality of the material, although expression levels were decreased 2–3-fold. The carboxyl-terminal region of the γ′ chain, from Val143to Leu427 (γ′C30), was also expressed and purified (Fig.1 B). In this case, the material in the second peak was used for characterization, since the material in the first peak appeared partially proteolyzed. Two γ chain fragments with specific mutations (γC30-Q329R and γC30-D364A) were also expressed in the same system, at levels of ∼50–75 mg/ml. The elution profiles for the two mutant fragments were essentially identical to that of rFbgγC30 (data not shown). The selection of the mutants was guided by naturally occurring mutations reported in the literature (23Ebert R.F. Index of Variant Human Fibrinogens. Organon Teknica/Biotechnology Research Institute, Rockville, MD1994Google Scholar) and by the examination of the three-dimensional structure of the rFbgγC30-GPRP complex (48Pratt K.P. Côté H.C.F. Chung D.W. Stenkamp R.E. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 95: 7176-7184Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The first mutant was analogous to Fibrinogen Nagoya (36Miyata T. Furukawa K. Iwanaga S. Takamatsu J. Saito H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1989; 105: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), in which glutamine 329 was replaced by arginine (Q329R). Aspartate 364 was changed to alanine (D364A) in the second mutant. This mutant was selected on the basis of the crystal structure of the complex of rFbgγC30 with the peptide GPRP, since Asp364 interacts strongly with the charged amino terminus of the GPRP peptide. The expression of a third mutant, γC30-D320S, was attempted using the same system. Based on the crystal structure (21Yee V.C. Pratt K.P. Côté H.C.F. Le Trong I. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 125-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), this mutation should have disrupted the calcium-binding site within rFbgγC30, and it was of interest to determine how this would affect its binding to the GPRP peptide. Very low expression of the γC30-D320S mutant was detected; however, purification of the mutant proved impossible, probably due to heterogeneous folding of the fragment (data not shown). The biological functions and characteristics of the various γC30s were determined by several different assays. Fragment D obtained by plasmin degradation of fibrinogen has been shown to inhibit fibrin polymerization (37Larrieu M.J. Rigollot C. Marder V.J. Br. J. Haematol. 1972; 22: 719-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). rFbgγC30 is a structural unit within fragment D; therefore, the inhibition of clotting by the addition of rFbgγC30 was examined to assess the folding of the molecule and its biological integrity. The inhibition of (desAA)fibrin polymerization by the various fragments (Fig. 2, A,B, C, and D) was assessed using two methods. The time required to reach half of the maximal turbidity was measured, since it is representative of the overall clotting reaction (Fig. 2 E). The maximum slopes of the turbidity curves, which reflect polymerization plus lateral aggregation of the fibers (38Furlan M. Rupp C. Beck E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), were also plotted as a function of the inhibitor concentration (Fig.2 F). The data show that both rFbgγC30 and fragment D inhibited clotting in a dose-dependent manner. However, fragment D inhibited (desAA)fibrin polymerization approximately 3–8 times more effectively than did rFbgγC30, depending on which parameters are compared. These results indicated that rFbgγC30, like fragment D, contains a functional polymerization site. rFbgγC30 hinders the linear elongation of protofibrils made of (desAA)fibrin monomers, most likely by binding to the amino termini of the α chains of (desAA)fibrin. This in turn affects the lateral aggregation of the fibers. Neither γC30-Q329R nor γC30-D364A affected the reaction significantly, indicating the lack of a functional polymerization pocket within the mutants. The bovine serum albumin control did not affect clotting at any of the concentrations tested (0–120 μm). The amount of fibrinopeptide A (FpA) released in all of the clotting assays was similar and showed no significant variation (data not shown). These observations indicate that rFbgγC30 does not affect FpA release directly and that the inhibition of clotting can be attributed to a specific blocking of the polymerization reaction. Fragment D is protected against plasmin degradation by the presence of calcium ions (17Haverkate F. Timan G. Thromb. Res. 1977; 10: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) or a peptide resembling the amino terminus of the fibrin α chain (GPRP) (39Yamazumi K. Doolittle R.F. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1719-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Several metal ions and synthetic peptides were tested for their ability to protect rFbgγC30, γ′C30, and the mutants against plasmin digestion. Calcium ions bound to rFbgγC30 and readily protected it from proteolytic degradation (Fig.3 A). The metal ions Zn2+, Tb3+, and Mn2+ but not Mg2+ also offered protection against plasmin degradation (data not shown). In the presence of EDTA, rFbgγC30 was completely degraded in 2 h (Fig. 3 B). Several synthetic peptides were also assayed for their ability to protect rFbgγC30 from plasmin digestion. Most of these synthetic peptides were modeled after the newly exposed amino terminus of the α chain following the removal of FpA by thrombin. This region is also referred to as polymerization site A. The peptide GHRP mimics the amino terminus of the β chain of fibrin, following removal of fibrinopeptide B by thrombin or polymerization site B. An unrelated peptide, GGYR, was employed as a control. The results indicated clearly that rFbgγC30 and γ′C30 bind the GPRP peptide in both its amide and carboxylate form and that the peptide-protein complexes were protected from plasmin digestion, even in the presence of EDTA (Fig.4, A and B). In contrast, the β chain-derived GHRP and the unrelated peptide GGYR offered no protection against plasmin. The longer peptides, which were identical to the amino-terminal sequence of the fibrin α chain, delayed the degradation of rFbgγC30 by plasmin, albeit considerably less efficiently than the GPRP peptides. Both of the γC30 mutants, Q329R and D364A, were protected by metal ions in the same manner as rFbgγC30 (data shown for Ca2+ only), but they were not protected against plasmin digestion by any of the peptides under these conditions (Fig. 4, C and D). These results were in agreement with the clotting inhibition assays and confirmed that rFbgγC30 possesses a functional polymerization pocket that interacted with polymerization site A. Furthermore, this interaction was disrupted in the mutants γC30-Q329R and γC30-D364A. Interestingly, neither mutation appeared to affect significantly the binding of metal ions such as Ca2+. Earlier experiments showed that rFbgγC30 binds Tb3+ in the same site that binds Ca2+(21Yee V.C. Pratt K.P. Côté H.C.F. Le Trong I. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 125-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The data presented here do not indicate whether the other metal ions interact with the molecule at the same site. It was established that the peptide GHRP does not protect rFbgγC30 against plasmin degradation. The possibility, however, that the peptide interacted with the protein without affecting its sensitivity to plasmin cannot be eliminated. The locat"

Although clustering of these mutations within the protein suggests the location of functionally important domains, the exact function of presenilin proteins is a matter of active investigation. One approach to find gene function is to study the regulation of PS-1 gene expression. Using in situ hybridization, we and others demonstrate that PS-1 mRNA is most highly expressed in neurons of the brain (17Kovacs D.M. Fausett H.J. Page K.J. Kim T. Moir R.D. Merriam D.E.

Nature. 1995; 375: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (3532) Google Scholar) reported that PS-1 mRNA is widely expressed in a variety of organs throughout the body. This raises the question why mutations in the PS-1 gene product appear to confer a disease state in familial Alzheimer's patients without apparent effect on their peripheral organs. The situation is further compounded because PS-1 mRNA and protein levels have not been reported thus leaving open the possibility that pathological regulation of PS-1 gene expression in familial Alzheimer's disease patients, compared with age-matched healthy controls, contributes to the disease state. Mutations in the PS-1 gene's promoter and non-protein encoding regions are not known and reports on the gene's wild-type sequence are lacking. Similarly, no functional analysis of the gene's ability to promote transcription has been reported. Combined with recent reports that PS-1 knockout mice are embryonic lethal (20Shen J. Bronson R.T. Chen D.F. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1997; 89: 629-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar), knowledge of the PS-1 gene sequence and its transcriptional regulation may be important clues that help to identify PS-1 function in both normal and diseased states. To begin answering some of these questions, we now report a detailed sequence of the mouse PS-1 gene including its promoter, the entire protein encoding region, and ending in exon 12. In addition to the usefulness of this sequence in creating additional PS-1 knockout mice, we have defined the PS-1 promoter's transcriptional regulatory elements. Our data on promoter activity suggests that the presenilin-1 gene is preferentially expressed and transcribed in neurons. Labeled oligonucleotides and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products of the mouse PS-1 cDNA were used as probes to screen mouse libraries for genomic PS-1 clones. Based on the mouse PS-1 cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession no. L42177), an upstream primer of sequence 5′-CGGAGAGAGAAGGAACCAAC-3′ and a downstream primer of sequence 5′-TCAGCTCTTCGTCTTCCTCCTCATC-3′ were used, with Quick Clone Mouse Brain cDNA (CLONTECH) as template, to amplify a portion of the mouse PS-1 cDNA by PCR. Amplification reactions were performed in a 100-μl volume containing 1 × PCR buffer II (Perkin-Elmer), MgCl2 (1.5 mm), dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP (0.2 mm each, Perkin-Elmer), DNA primers at 0.5 μm, 1 μl of cDNA template (0.1 ng), and Ampli-Taq DNA polymerase (5 units, Perkin-Elmer). The reaction cycle was 95 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 2 min for a total of 30 cycles. This PCR product was gel-purified and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and a Random Primers DNA labeling system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Labeled probe was used to conventionally screen a mouse strain 129/SVJ genomic library in Lambda Fix-II vector (Stratagene) as described previously (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Screening identified four independent phage clones designated Ph-1, Ph-2, Ph-3, and Ph-4 (see Fig. 2). Following digestion with NotI and/orEcoRI, restriction enzyme fragments were subcloned into pBluescript-II-KS(+) phagemid vector (Stratagene) using a DNA ligation kit (Stratagene). DNA sequence was determined using an Applied Biosystems model 373A automated DNA sequencer with dye terminator chemistry and protocols recommended by the manufacturer. Additional oligonucleotide probes from the 5′-untranslated region of the mouse PS-1 cDNA were labeled with [32P]ATP and T4-polynucleotide kinase and used to identify plasmid subclones by hybridization. Based on the partial sequence of phage clone Ph-2, the PCR primers 1C-US-for (GATCACAGTCTAGGTTGCTGGTGTG) and 1C-US-rev (TGGGGCAAGGGACACAAATAAG) were used to further screen a mouse ES-129/SVJ genomic library in a P1 vector (Genome Systems Inc.) by PCR. Of the three P1 clones identified, P1–10809 was digested withEcoRI or HindIII, and these restriction enzyme fragments were subcloned and sequenced as described above. The 5′ end of PS-1 cDNA was identified using mouse-brain, Marathon-Ready cDNA (male BALB/c, 9–11 weeks of age,CLONTECH). Briefly, a 50-μl PCR reaction containing a PS-1-specific reverse primer (TGGCTCAGGGTTGTCAAGTC, 0.2 μm), the CLONTECH AP1 adaptor primer (CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC, 0.2 μm), 2.5 ng of Marathon-Ready cDNA, 1 × PCR buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.), MgCl2 (1.5 mm), dimethyl sulfoxide (5%), dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP (0.2 mm each), andTaq DNA polymerase (5 units, Life Technologies, Inc.) was used with a reaction cycle of 95 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 90 s for a total of 30 cycles in the first amplification step. The 100-μl second PCR amplification step contained a mouse PS-1-specific reverse primer, 151–130-reverse (CAAACCTCTTGGGATTCTTTC, 0.5 μm) and the nestedCLONTECH adaptor primer AP2 (ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC, 0.5 μm), 0.01 μl of the first PCR amplification, 1 × PCR buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.), MgCl2 (1.5 mm), dimethyl sulfoxide (5%), dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP (0.2 mm each), and Taq DNA polymerase (5 units, Life Technologies, Inc.) with the same cycling parameters as in the first amplification step. In some second PCR reactions, the PS-1-specific reverse primer 101–80-reverse (AAGACCTCGAAGGGCTGCTGTC) was used. RACE amplification products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels run in TAE, visualized with ethidium bromide and ultraviolet light, extracted from the gel matrix with a Wizard PCR Preps DNA purification system (Promega), ligated into a pGEM-T vector (Promega), and transformed into competent DH5-α bacterial cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). Ampicillin-resistant colonies were characterized by restriction enzyme digestion, PCR amplification with a variety of primer combinations, and DNA sequencing as above. Comparison of the mouse PS-1 promoter with other eukaryotic promoter sequences was performed using the BLAST network service and the eukaryotic promoter data base Release 45 available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Mouse genomic DNA fragments containing portions of the putative PS-1 promoter were subcloned upstream of the firefly luciferase gene into the promoterless pGL3-basic vector (Promega). Based on the sequence of genomic DNA, PCR primers were designed to incorporate XhoI sites into the forward primers andHindIII sites into the reverse primers. Corresponding to different locations in the genomic DNA (see Fig. 2), these primers were used to PCR amplify fragments which were purified with a Wizard purification system (Promega), digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and repurified with the Wizard kit. Cleaved PCR products were ligated into pGL3 plasmid cleaved with the same restriction enzymes and transformed into competent bacteria, and clones containing plasmids with inserts were verified by DNA sequencing. Mouse Neuro2a-neuroblastoma cells, mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma and mouse NIH/3T3 fibroblast cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Neuro2a cells were routinely propagated in minimal essential medium with Earle's salt (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), and 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.). P19 cells were routinely propagated in α-minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2.5% fetal calf serum, and 7.5% bovine serum (Hyclone). Differentiation of P19 cells to neuron-like cells followed treatment with 0.5 μmall-trans-retinoic acid (22Jones-Villeneuve E.M.V. Rudnicki M.A. Harris J.F. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 2271-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Differentiation of P19 cells to muscle-like cells followed treatment with 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (23Edwards M.K.S. Harris J.F. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 2280-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). NIH/3T3 cells were routinely propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) plus 10% fetal calf serum. For transient transfection, Neuro2a, P19, retinoic acid-treated-P19, dimethyl sulfoxide-treated P19, and NIH/3T3 cells were plated in six-well tissue culture dishes at 9 × 104 cells/well and allowed to recover for 1 day. Cells containing PS-1-promoter/reporter constructs were then co-transfected with 0.3 pmol of one of the promoter firefly luciferase plasmid constructs, pGL3 basic vector or pGL3 promoter plasmid (which contains an SV40 promoter upstream of the firefly luciferase gene, Promega), and 0.3 pmol of pRL-TK plasmid (which contains a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter upstream of the renilla luciferase gene, Promega), using the Lipofectin procedure (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described in the manufacture's protocol. Transfected cells were cultured for 24 h, washed twice with 2 ml of Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with Passive lysis buffer (Promega). Firefly luciferase and renilla (sea pansy) luciferase activities were measured sequentially using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega) and a model TD-20E Luminometer (Turner Design). After measuring the firefly luciferase signal (LAF) and the renilla (sea pansy) luciferase signal (LAR), the relative luciferase activity (RLA) was calculated as: RLA = LAF/LAR, where relative RLA was calculated as a percentage, i.e.%RLA = RLA/(RLA)max. To compare the relative luciferase activity in one cell line with another, an index of relative luciferase activity was calculated as: IRLA = RLA/RLASV40, where RLASV40 is the ratio of firefly luciferase signal with an SV40 promoter in pGL3 divided by the renilla luciferase signal in pRL-TK. As a prelude to cloning the PS-1 promoter, the exact 5′-end of PS-1 mRNA from mouse brain was identified by the RACE technique. Using the antisense oligonucleotide “101–80-reverse” found in exon 2 of mouse PS-1, 5′-RACE gives a major broad band of 210 bp and a minor band of 430 bp from single-stranded cDNA templates complementary to mouse brain mRNA (Marathon Ready cDNA, CLONTECH, data not shown). Each of these bands was isolated from agarose gels, subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced. Sequencing revealed the presence of three different PS-1 transcripts which appear to derive from two unique transcriptional start sites (Fig.1). This information suggests that the PS-1 gene may contain two promoters and that differential splicing of exons, should they exist in genomic DNA, might generate multiple transcripts. A mouse genomic DNA library in Lambda FIX-II was screened with the 5′-portion of the mouse PS-1 cDNA (Fig. 2 A, probe A). Of the positively hybridizing phage clones, four were selected for restriction mapping with EcoRI and NotI as shown in Fig. 2 B. Only one phage clone, Ph-2 hybridized to oligonucleotides from the 5′-untranslated region of the mouse PS-1 cDNA. Primers from the phage arms allowed sequencing into the genomic DNA insert. The insert's sequence allowed the PCR primer pair “1C-US-forward and 1C-US-reverse” to be chosen and used to identify a P1 clone of the mouse PS-1 genomic DNA as shown in Fig.2 A. Clone P1–10809 was identified through a positive PCR reaction product with these primers and hybridization to the PS-1 cDNA fragment probe A (Fig. 2). P1–10809 was then restricted, mapped and its entire sequence subcloned into multiple pBluescript-II-KS-(+) plasmid vectors as shown by the thick lines in Fig. 2 B. Each subclone was sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 373A automated DNA sequencing machine using protocols supplied by the manufacturer. The sequence of almost 50 kbp of the P1–10809 clone was compared with the mouse PS-1 cDNA sequence and regions of homology aligned with the MacVector DNA analysis program (IBI, New Haven, CT). The first nucleotide on the 5′ end of the RNA transcript is usually designated as nucleotide +1 of exon 1. In our case, PS-1 appears to have two different 5′-end-sequences which are associated with three different length RNA transcripts (Fig. 1,transcript-A, transcript-B, andtranscript-C). The alignment of transcript-A with genomic sequence shows that a “G,” designated conventionally as position +1 in exon 1, corresponds to the transcription start site. The presenilin gene's exon 1A extends from position +1 to +141, which is spliced to exon 2, whose 5′-end begins at gene position number +11,210, to give transcript A. The alignment of transcript B with genomic DNA shows that a “C” at position +411 corresponds to the alternative transcription start site. We define this second start site as beginning in exon 1B, which extends from position +411 to +781 and is spliced to exon 2 (gene position number +11,210) to give transcript B. The alignment of transcript C with genomic DNA shows the same “C” at position +411 as the alternative transcription start site followed by a shorter sequence alignment. We define exon 1C as extending from position +411 to +549 which is spliced to exon 2 (gene position number +11,210) to give transcript C. Thus, the 5′-untranslated regions of PS-1 RNA transcripts include exon 1A, exon 1B, exon 1C, and exon 2 together with a portion of exon 3 (Fig. 2 C and TableI). The protein-encoding portions of the gene begin with the ATG codon at gene position number +11,420 where translation initiates in exon 3 followed by exons encoding the remainder of the protein until stopping at a TAG codon in exon 12 (position +45,627). 983 bp downstream from this TAG stop codon lies the putative polyadenylation signal AATTAA at position +46,612. Interestingly, the Intron between exon 1 and exon 2 is about 10 kbp, between exon 3 and exon 4 is about 12 kbp and between exon 5 and exon 6 is about 8 kbp, whose sequences, together with the rest of the PS-1 exons and introns, can be found in GenBankTM(accession no. AF007560).Table INumbering scheme for the mouse PS-1 gene's exon-intron structurePositionExon 1A1–141 1B411–781 1C411–549 211210–11276 311367–11506 423849–24099 526311–26452 634555–34622 736060–36280 839773–39871 940245–40331 1042082–42255 1143217–43335 1245459 –A of ATG11420T of TAG45627AATTAA46612The positions of the 5′-end and the 3′-end of each exon were counted from the transcription start site of exon 1A being defined as position +1. Open table in a new tab The positions of the 5′-end and the 3′-end of each exon were counted from the transcription start site of exon 1A being defined as position +1. The DNA located upstream and surrounding the transcription initiation sites typically confers the gene's promoter activity. When the DNA surrounding the transcript A initiation of transcription site was compared with its human PS-1 genomic DNA counterpart (Fig.3), 3N. Mitsuda, A. D. Roses, and M. P. Vitek, unpublished results. the region of maximal similarity extends from positions −39 to +117 of the mouse PS-1 sequence. This region is rich in guanosine (G) and cytosine (C) residues containing the sequence motifs: GCCGGAAGT resembling an Ets 1–3 element (30Fisher R.J. Mavrothalassitis G. Kondoh A. Papas T.S. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2249-2254PubMed Google Scholar) and GGGCGGG motif resembling an Sp-1 hexanucleotide element, which is commonly found in the promoters of other genes. The mouse sequences upstream of this region do not share similarity with the human sequence nor do they contain the most common eukaryotic promoter element, a TATA box (Fig.4). Instead, this unique mouse sequence contains two CAAATA motifs, at positions −365 and −281, which resemble CAAT boxes found in other eukaryotic promoters. This region unique to mouse also contains an Ap-2 binding element at position −80 (CCCAGCCC) and a sequence similar to a heat shock inducible element at position −220 (CTCGAATCGCAG). Putative Sp-1 hexanucleotide binding sites with the sequence GGGCGG or CCGCCC are found downstream from the +1 site of transcription initiation with exon 1A containing two Sp1 motifs and the exon 1A/exon 1B intron containing five Sp1 motifs. Also downstream of the Cap (transcription initiation) site are two additional Ap-2 sites and another Ets 1–3 motif.Figure 4Nucleotide sequence of the mouse PS-1 promoter region. The sequence of mouse PS-1 gene flanking the two transcription initiation sites, marked with vertical arrows, is displayed.

Exon 1A and exon 1B aredouble-underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We employed a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) to test whether these elements function to promote transcription. In general, we assayed the promoter activity of DNAs flanking the transcription initiation site of PS-1 by inserting these DNA fragments in front of a basic, promoterless firefly luciferase reporter gene in plasmid pGL3. Constant amounts of pGL3 containing PS-1 promoter fragments and of pRL-TK plasmid containing a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter driving expression of sea pansy luciferase, were co-transfected into a constant number of cells. After 24 h, lysates of transfected cells were sequentially assayed for firefly luciferase (LAF) and sea pansy luciferase activity (LAR) so that a ratio of firefly to sea pansy activities could be calculated for each PS-1 promoter fragment as its relative luciferase activity or RLA. Of all the fragments tested, plasmid LUC 29 with the fragment −327 to +206 showed the greatest ratio of firefly to sea pansy activity (Fig. 5 and TableII), which we defined as 100% activity. Larger fragments in LUC 1 (−2232 to +1436), LUC 3 (−499 to +1171), and LUC 16 (−276 to +519) display only a small percentage of the LUC 29 activity, suggesting the presence of negative elements that apparently reduce their activities. Interestingly, the high activity of LUC 29 is not found in its flanking fragments such as LUC 2 (−2232 to −496) and LUC 23 (+188 to +519), which both lack significant promoter activity. The LUC 23 result is particularly interesting because the alternative transcription start site begins at position +411 of exon 1B/exon 1C and apparently lacks meaningful promoter activity.Table IINeuron-preferred activity of total and core promoter regions of the mouse PS-1 genePromoterCell line2-aCell lines are defined in the legend to Fig. 6.N2aP19NP19P19MNIH/3T3RLASV40 (control)2.110.65.035.91.1Total promoter36.8114.121.2114.90.3Core promoter3.611.53.719.40.1IRLATotal promoter17.810.84.33.20.3Core promoter1.71.10.70.50.1 Total/Core10.29.95.85.93.4LUC29 and LUC27 were transiently transfected into the cell lines to measure the activities of total- and core-promoter, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2068403274,"We purified a novel serine protease with a molecular mass of 26 kDa from Sarcophaga pupae. This protease appeared almost exclusively in the yellow body, an organ that develops temporarily in the pupae of dipteran insects and expands to form the adult midgut by engulfing the larval midgut. cDNA analysis revealed that this protease consists of 239 amino acid residues and has significant structural similarity with bovine trypsin (about 40% sequence identity). The 26-kDa protease gene was transiently activated in 1-day-old pupae. The protease was found to cross-react immunologically with antibody against sarcotoxin IA, an antibacterial protein produced by this insect. It is suggested that this protease participates in the decomposition of the larval midgut in the yellow body during metamorphosis.

The protease was found to cross-react immunologically with antibody against sarcotoxin IA, an antibacterial protein produced by this insect. It is suggested that this protease participates in the decomposition of the larval midgut in the yellow body during metamorphosis. In holometabolous insects, most larval tissues disintegrate during the pupal stage, and new adult structures develop from imaginal discs (1Bodenstin D. Demerce M. Biology of Drosophila. Hafner Publishing Co, Inc., New York1950: 275-367Google Scholar). However, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying the selective decomposition of larval tissues (2Lockshin R.A. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.I. Comprehensive Insect Physiology, Biochemistry, and Pharmacology. 2. Pergamon Press Ltd., Oxford1985: 301-317Google Scholar). Recently, we suggested that hemocyte cathepsin B is responsible for decomposition of the fat body in Sarcophaga peregrina (flesh fly) (3Kurata S. Saito H. Natori S. Insect Biochem. 1990; 20: 461-465Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 4Kurata S. Saito H. Natori S. Dev. Biol. 1992; 153: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We purified this enzyme and isolated its cDNA (5Kurata S. Saito H. Natori S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 911-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 6Takahashi N. Kurata S. Natori S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Sarcophaga cathepsin B differs from its mammalian counterparts in several respects. It does not seem to be a typical lysosomal enzyme, as its optimum pH is higher (pH 6.0) (5Kurata S. Saito H. Natori S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 911-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Moreover, production of this enzyme was shown to be regulated at the translational level, since larval hemocytes contained a significant amount of cathepsin B mRNA but not the enzyme itself (7Yano T. Takahashi N. Kurata S. Natori S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The mRNA started to be translated on pupation, and cathepsin B then accumulated in the hemocytes. When pupal hemocytes containing cathepsin B interacted with the fat body, the enzyme was released and digested the basement membrane of the fat body, resulting in its decomposition (4Kurata S. Saito H. Natori S. Dev. Biol. 1992; 153: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This paper reports the purification, cDNA cloning, and some characteristics of a novel serine protease that is likely to participate in the decomposition of the larval midgut during metamorphosis. This enzyme was discovered incidentally during a study of sarcotoxin IA, a cecropin-type antibacterial protein produced bySarcophaga (8Okada M. Natori S. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We purified a protein that reacted immunologically with anti-sarcotoxin IA antibody from an extract ofSarcophaga pupae. This protein was revealed to be a novel serine protease, which was preferentially induced in the yellow body, in which disintegration of the larval midgut takes place during metamorphosis. During remodeling of the midgut, the yellow body is known to be formed as a first step (1Bodenstin D. Demerce M. Biology of Drosophila. Hafner Publishing Co, Inc., New York1950: 275-367Google Scholar). It surrounds the larval midgut at the pupal stage. A morphological change of the yellow body is induced to form the adult midgut simultaneously with the disintegration of the larval midgut. Therefore, we assume that this novel protease is responsible for disintegration of the larval midgut within the yellow body. Taking into account our previous results (3Kurata S. Saito H. Natori S. Insect Biochem. 1990; 20: 461-465Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 4Kurata S. Saito H. Natori S. Dev. Biol. 1992; 153: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), it is suggested that several proteases participate in tissue remodeling during insect metamorphosis. Flesh flies (S. peregrina) were reared according to the method of Ohtaki (9Ohtaki T. Jpn. J. Med. Sci. Biol. 1966; 19: 97-104Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The physiological age of third instar larvae can be synchronized by dry-wet treatment; when larvae were transferred from wet conditions to dry conditions at 27 °, they started to pupate 16 h later. Thereafter, we defined them as 1-day-old pupae. Adults emerged 10 days after pupation under our rearing conditions. Therefore, 10-day-old pupae are synonymous with newly emerged adults. Pupae were used after removing their pupal shells. About 200 pupae were homogenized in 40 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.9) containing 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 μg/ml pepstatin. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was collected and used as the pupal extracts. Antiserum was raised against synthetic sarcotoxin IA as described previously (10Yamada K. Nakajima Y. Natori S. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As sarcotoxin IA is a small peptide consisting of 39 amino acid residues, we first coated reverse-phase column packing material (C18) with sarcotoxin IA according to the method of Flyg et al. (11Flyg C. Dalhammat G. Rasmuson B. Boman H.G. Insect Biochem. 1987; 17: 153-160Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar), then immunized albino rabbits with the sarcotoxin IA-coated particles. The resulting antiserum was affinity-purified with sarcotoxin IA. For this, sarcotoxin IA (300 μg) was first covalently linked to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad). A 2-fold dilution of anti-sarcotoxin IA antiserum (4 ml) was then mixed with this gel and kept overnight at 4 °C. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (130 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 8 mmNa2HPO4·12H2O, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, pH 6.8), the gel was packed in a column and washed stepwise with 0.2 m glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2.8) without and with 4 m urea. Anti-sarcotoxin IA antibody was eluted from the column at the second step. The eluate was neutralized with 1 m Tris solution, and fetal calf serum was added at a final concentration of 10% (w/v). On immunoblotting of the immunized larval extract, this antibody specifically recognized sarcotoxin IA. Electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide slab gel was carried out by the method of Laemmli (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Samples were denatured by heating them for 20 min at 75 °C in 1% (w/v) SDS and 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained according to the method of Fairbanks et al. (13Fairbanks G. Steck T.L. Wallach D.L.H. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (6177) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, proteins separated by electrophoresis were transferred electrophoretically from the gel onto a filter (Immobilon P; Millipore). The filters were immersed in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.9) containing 5% (w/v) skim milk for 1 h. After washing with rinsing solution (10 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.9) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1%(v/v) Triton X-100, 0.01% (w/v) sodium azide, and 0.25% skim milk), they were dipped in rinsing solution containing affinity-purified antibody against sarcotoxin IA and kept overnight at 4 °C. They were then washed well with rinsing solution, transferred to 5 ml rinsing solution containing radioiodinated anti-rabbit IgG (3.7 kBq), and kept at room temperature for 3 h. Finally, they were washed well with rinsing solution, dried, and subjected to autoradiography with Kodak XAR film. Extracts of 3-day-old pupae were found to contain a 26-kDa protein that reacts immunologically with anti-sarcotoxin IA antibody. To purify this protein, we defined 1 unit of the protein as the amount that gave the same immunoreactivity as 0.25 ng of sarcotoxin IA on immunoblotting followed by densitometric scanning of the 26-kDa protein band. The 26-kDa protein in the pupal extract was precipitated by ammonium sulfate between 40–65% (w/v) saturation. The resulting precipitate was collected, dissolved in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 25 mm NaCl, and dialyzed extensively against the same buffer. The dialyzate was applied to a CM-cellulose column (1.5 × 6 cm) that had been equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed well, then the adsorbed materials were eluted stepwise with 10 mm phosphate buffers containing 120 and 350 mmNaCl, respectively. The 26-kDa protein was eluted by the latter buffer. This fraction was subjected to reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MCA, methylcoumaryl-7-amide; Boc, butyloxycarbonyl; E-64,trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino) butane. with a Synchropak RP-P C18 column. The 26-kDa protein was eluted with 37% (v/v) acetonitrile when the column was developed with a linear gradient of 0–100% acetonitrile in 0.05%(v/v) trifluoroacetic acid solution. The 26-kDa protein was almost pure at this stage and gave a single band when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purified 26-kDa protein was digested with lysyl endopeptidase, and the resulting peptides were separated by HPLC on a C18 column (Gilson). The fractions containing each peptide were lyophilized and the sequences of 5 peptides, including the 10 amino-terminal residues, were determined. Using these peptide sequences, oligodeoxyribonucleotides corresponding to MHPQYDPV and DAIVAGWG were synthesized. Their sequences were 5′-ATGCA(T/C)CCICA(A/G)TA(T/C)GA(T/C)CCIGTICA-3′ and 5′-CCCCAICC(T/C/A/G)GCIAC(A/G/T)ATIGC(A/G)TC-3′, respectively. These oligodeoxyribonucleotides were mixed and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by the method of Sgaramella and Khorana (14Sgaramella V. Khorana H.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 72: 427-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from homogenates of 2-day-old pupae by the guanidine thiocyanate method of Chirgwin et al. (15Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar); poly(A)-rich RNA was prepared with (dT)30 latex beads. A cDNA library of this poly(A)-rich RNA was constructed with the expression vector Zap (Stratagene). This cDNA library in bacteriophage Uni-Zap XR vector converted into cDNA library in plasmid pBluescript by the method of Short et al. (16Short J.M. Fernandez J.M. Sorge J.A. Huse W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7583-7600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). We screened 5 × 104 colonies and obtained nine hybridization-positive clones. We analyzed the two plasmids with the longest insert. These clones yielded identical restriction maps, and their inserts were found to contain one determined amino acid sequence. Therefore, one of these clones was selected for further analysis. For nucleotide sequencing of the cDNA, various deletion derivatives of the DNA fragment were prepared using exonuclease III and mung bean nuclease. Each deletion derivative was sequenced, and the nucleotide sequences of both strands were determined. Northern blot hybridization was performed in 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE (1 × SSPE equals 0.15m NaCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA), 1 × Denhardt's solution (0.02% (w/v) each of Ficoll 400, bovine serum albumin, and polyvinylpyrrolidone), 0.1% SDS, and sonicated salmon sperm DNA solution (200 μg/ml) for 18 h at 42 °C. The filters were then washed for 15 min each time with 0.1 × SSC (1 × SSC equals 0.15 mNaCl, 0.05 m sodium citrate) containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature and 42 °C and then autoradiographed at −80 °C. The DNA used as a probe was a 26-kDa protein cDNA-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the BcaBEST random primer labeling kit (Takara, Tokyo). Protease activity was assayed with various peptidylmethylcoumaryl-7-amide (peptidyl-MCA) substrates. The enzyme reaction was performed in 0.25 ml of 0.1 mTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.9) containing 0.1 mm substrate, 1 mm EDTA, and the enzyme sample. After incubation for 10 min at 27 °C, the reaction was terminated by adding 0.375 ml of 17% aqueous acetic acid. The fluorescence was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 460 nm, respectively. An antibody against the 26-kDa protein was raised by injecting the purified protein (15 μg) in complete Freund's adjuvant into two male albino rabbits with three booster injections of 10 μg of protein and incomplete Freund's adjuvant at intervals of 14 days. Affinity purification of the antibody was achieved in essentially the same way as the preparation of a specific antibody against regenectin (17Kubo T. Kawasaki K. Nonomura Y. Natori S. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1991; 35: 83-90PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that the sarcotoxin IA gene was transiently activated during the early pupal stage in Sarcophaga (18Nanbu R. Nakajima Y. Ando K. Natori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To prove that sarcotoxin IA is in fact present in the pupae, we performed immunoblotting using pupal extracts prepared from pupae harvested at various developmental stages. As shown in the lower panel of Fig. 1 A, sarcotoxin IA was detected in 3–6-day-old pupae, and the content was estimated to be approximately 10 ng/mg of protein. Synthesis of sarcotoxin IA corresponded with expression of the sarcotoxin IA gene that we reported previously (18Nanbu R. Nakajima Y. Ando K. Natori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition to sarcotoxin IA, the antibody was found to cross-react with a protein with a molecular mass of 26 kDa (26-kDa protein) (top panel). When the antibody was treated with sarcotoxin IA-coated silica beads to absorb specific antibody, the remaining antibody reacted with neither sarcotoxin IA nor with the 26-kDa protein (Fig. 1 B), indicating that the 26-kDa protein cross-reacted immunologically with anti-sarcotoxin IA antibody. Other signals in the high molecular mass region are nonspecific background ones, since they were independent of the first antibody. The 26-kDa protein was detected exclusively in 3–7-day-old pupae; thereafter it disappeared rapidly. The 26-kDa protein signal was very strong, and its content did not seem to change throughout this period. This protein is not a precursor of sarcotoxin IA, because cDNA analysis has shown that there is no precursor protein for sarcotoxin IA (19Matsumoto N. Okada M. Takahashi H. Ming Q.X. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi Y. Komano H. Natori S. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To study the structural relationship between sarcotoxin IA and the 26-kDa protein, we purified the 26-kDa protein from pupal extracts. Purification was monitored by immunoblotting followed by densitometric scanning of the 26-kDa protein band using anti-sarcotoxin IA antibody. 1 unit of 26-kDa protein was defined as the amount that gave the same immunoreactivity as 0.25 ng of sarcotoxin IA on immunoblotting. The typical purification is summarized in TableI, and HPLC, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting profiles of the sample during the final purification step are shown in Fig.2. About 250 μg of pure protein was obtained from the extracts of about 200 pupae.Table ISummary of purification of a 26-kDa proteinPurification step26-kDa proteinTotal proteinSpecific contentYieldunitsmgunits/mg%Crude homogenate supernatant87,50094193100Ammonium sulfate, 40–65% saturation43,2004709249.4CM-cellulose14,4000.68421,00016.5Reverse-phase HPLC10,0000.24541,00011.4 Open table in a new tab To determine the amino acid sequence of the 26-kDa protein, we isolated its cDNA. For this, we first determined the amino acid sequences of five peptides derived from the 26-kDa protein, including its amino-terminal sequence. These were VIMHPQYDPVHITNDVALLR, DAIVAGWGLFK, FLDWIHNNSR, YPWTAQLVK, and IVGGTQVRQN (amino terminus). Having obtained this sequence information, we synthesized DNA probes, used them to screen the cDNA library of Sarcophaga pupae, and obtained nine hybridization-positive clones. The nucleotide sequence of the insert and the deduced amino acid sequence of one of these clones are shown in Fig.3. The amino acid sequence contained all the sequences determined for the five peptides derived from the 26-kDa protein, indicating that it was a cDNA clone for the 26-kDa protein. We designated the Ile at position 87 as its amino-terminal residue starting from the first Met residue. Therefore, the 26-kDa protein consists of 239 amino acid residues. The 86 residues from the first Met are thought to be a prosegment that includes a signal sequence, possibly consisting of 18 residues. No significant sequence similarity was found between the 26-kDa protein and sarcotoxin IA. Therefore, it is uncertain why the antibody against sarcotoxin IA cross-reacted with the 26-kDa protein. However, as shown in Fig. 4, the 26-kDa protein was found to have significant sequence similarity with bovine trypsin, and the His, Asp, and Ser residues conserved in many serine proteases are also present in the 26-kDa protein, suggesting that the 26-kDa protein is a serine protease. The maximal sequence identity between the 26-kDa protein and bovine trypsin was about 40%. As it became evident that the 26-kDa protein was likely to be a novel serine protease, we assayed its protease activity using various peptidyl-MCA substrates. As shown in Table II, purified 26-kDa protein clearly hydrolyzed substrates with Arg or Lys at their carboxyl termini. Therefore, the substrate specificity of this protease is vary similar to that of trypsin. Other substrates, including those of chymotrypsin and prolyl endopeptidase, were not hydrolyzed by this enzyme.Table IISubstrate specificity of the 26-kDa proteaseSubstrateActivityμmol of 7-amino-4-methyl coumarin released/mgBoc-Gln-Ala-Arg-MCA258Boc-Leu-Thr-Arg-MCA203Boc-Phe-Ser-Arg-MCA131Pro-Phe-Arg-MCA77Carbobenzoxy-Phe-Arg-MCA69Boc-Val-Leu-Lys-MCA60Pyr-Gly-Arg-MCA17Carbobenzoxy-Arg-Arg-MCA7Benzoyl-Arg-MCA3Succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-MCA<1Succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-MCA<1Succinyl-Ala-Pro-Ala-MCA<1Succinyl-Gly-Pro-MCA<1Protease activity was assayed with the indicated substrates under the standard conditions. Open table in a new tab Protease activity was assayed with the indicated substrates under the standard conditions. We examined the characteristics of this protease using Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-MCA as a substrate. The optimum pH range for this protease was rather broad, between pH 6 and 8. However, no enzyme activity was detected above pH 10 or below pH 4, suggesting that it is not a lysosomal enzyme. This protease was sensitive to diisopropyl fluorophosphate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and antipain but not to E-64, indicating that it is a typical serine protease. To estimate the biological role of the 26-kDa protease, we examined its localization within pupae. For this, we prepared affinity-purified antibody against the 26-kDa protease using purified protein. In contrast to sarcotoxin IA antibody, this antibody reacted only with the 26-kDa protease and not with sarcotoxin IA. Significant fluorescence was detected in the pupal midgut (the so-called “yellow body”) when pupal sections were subjected to an immunofluorescence study. Localization in other regions was not clear because of high background fluorescence (data not shown). To confirm this observation, we prepared homogenates of the whole body, head, thorax and abdomen, and yellow body of 3-day-old pupae and subjected them to immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.5 A, the 26-kDa protease signal was detectable in homogenates of the whole body, thorax and abdomen, and yellow body but not in that of head. Moreover, several other signals besides that of the 26-kDa protease were detected in the homogenate of the yellow body, suggesting that various proteases that cross-react immunologically with the anti-26-kDa protease antibody are concentrated in the yellow body. The yellow body appears at the pupal stage and engulfs the larval midgut, finally developing into the adult midgut after the larval midgut has been disintegrated in situ. Therefore, we examined the expression of these proteases in the yellow body in parallel with adult development within the pupal case. As is evident from Fig. 5 B, no appreciable signal was detectable when the midguts of third instar larvae or the yellow bodies of 1-day-old pupae were examined. However, at least four signals, including that of the 26-kDa protease, became detectable in the yellow bodies of 2-day-old pupae. Many of these persisted for several days but disappeared rapidly during the late pupal stage. It is likely that various proteases that cross-react immunologically with anti-26-kDa protease antibody are synthesized simultaneously in the pupal yellow body. Therefore, we examined changes in the expression of the 26-kDa protease gene with time after pupation by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig. 6, mRNA for the 26-kDa protease was detected exclusively in RNA extracted from 1-day-old pupae, and no appreciable signal was detected in RNA from pupae at other stages. Thus, it is clear that the 26-kDa protease gene is transiently activated for a restricted period during development, but the protease translated from the resulting mRNA persists in the yellow body for several days. We found and purified a 26-kDa protein that cross-reacts immunologically with anti-sarcotoxin IA antibody in the pupal extracts of Sarcophaga. This protein was found to be a novel serine protease with significant sequence similarity to bovine trypsin. Northern blotting and immunoblotting experiments revealed that the 26-kDa protease gene was transiently activated during the early pupal stage, and the 26-kDa protease was found to accumulate in the yellow body. In dipteran insects, the larval midgut is known to disintegrate, and the adult midgut develops during the pupal stage (1Bodenstin D. Demerce M. Biology of Drosophila. Hafner Publishing Co, Inc., New York1950: 275-367Google Scholar). This process proceeds in a temporary organ named the yellow body. Adult midgut cells derived from the imaginal island on the larval midgut surround the larval midgut to form a primordial adult midgut. This swells to form the yellow body. The larval midgut is engulfed by the yellow body and disintegrates in situ. The yellow body itself then extends to form the adult midgut during the development of adult structures. Therefore, the 26-kDa protease and other related proteases that transiently appear in the yellow body at a specific developmental stage are likely to play a role in the disintegration of the larval midgut and construction of the adult one. These proteases are not simply digestive enzymes, because the larvae stop feeding as soon as they reach the third instar, and no food remains in the digestive tract during the pupal stage. We found that the 26-kDa protease gene is transiently activated before induction of the enzyme, and that the timing of gene activation seems to depend strictly upon the developmental stage of the adult in the pupal case. The expression of the genes for other proteases that cross-react immunologically with the 26-kDa protease are likely to be regulated in the same way. Although we were able to identify the timing of the activation of the 26-kDa protease gene, the cells synthesizing the mRNA for this enzyme remained to be identified. As it is localized in the yellow body, adult midgut cells are most probable candidate cells. The 26-kDa protease was first detected immunologically using an antibody against sarcotoxin IA. Sarcotoxin IA is an antibacterial protein produced by Sarcophaga, which consists of 39 amino acid residues (19Matsumoto N. Okada M. Takahashi H. Ming Q.X. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi Y. Komano H. Natori S. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We raised the antibody using chemically synthesized sarcotoxin IA. No significant sequence similarity was found between sarcotoxin IA and the 26-kDa protease. During remodeling of the midgut from the larval to the adult type during metamorphosis, normalSarcophaga flora living in the larval midgut are killed and replaced with adult flora. It is possible that the 26-kDa protease contains an epitope with a similar secondary or tertiary structure to sarcotoxin IA, and that this epitope has sarcotoxin IA-like antibacterial activity that might kill the normal larval flora that are dispersed in the yellow body when the larval midgut disintegrates in it. Another possibility to be noted is that sarcotoxin IA is a covalent inhibitor of the 26 kDa protease, and the covalently bound sarcotoxin IA reacted with the antibody. This possibility needs further examination."

Here we show that apoC-III expression in HepG2 cells is negatively regulated in response to interleukin-1 (IL-1), and this inhibition is mainly due to transcriptional repression. CAAT enhancer-binding protein δ (C/EBPδ) was found to be the main mediator of IL-1-induced suppression. Analysis of the apoC-III promoter revealed two IL-1 response elements. The first is located in the proximal promoter region D and the second in the distal enhancer region I. Proximal element D is a high affinity binding site for C/EBPδ, while the enhancer element I is not directly recognized by this transcription factor. Functional analysis of different combinations of homologous and heterologous promoter constructs revealed that indirect interaction of C/EBPδ with site I, in the context of the full promoter, leads to repression. C/EBPδ is activated by phosphorylation during IL-1-induced signal transduction pathway. This modification is important for both DNA binding activity and indirect transrepression of the apoC-III promoter.

Systematic injury, or infections, trigger a complex series of regulatory mechanisms that eventually lead to dramatic alterations in the serum levels of several proteins that are predominantly synthesized in the liver (1Fey G.

Saunders Co., Philadelphia1990: 89-116Google Scholar). These characteristic changes involving proteins that have protective or regulatory roles in the inflammatory response define the hepatic acute phase reaction, an important host defense mechanism to maintain physiological homeostasis, prior to the onset of the immune response (3Baumann H.

These interactions trigger a multistep process eventually leading to the activation of distinct combinations of a small subset of transcription factors that recognize well defined response elements in the promoters of acute phase genes (6Poli V.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2417-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) raised the possibility that the expression of this gene may be modulated during the IL-1 signaling pathway. ApoC-III is a major component of chylomicrons and very low density lipoprotein particles and a minor component of HDL. In vitro, ApoC-III inhibits the hydrolysis of triglycerides by lipoprotein lipase (33Wang C.S. McConathy W.J. Kloer H.U. Alaupovic P. J. Clin.

Therefore changes in apoC-III expression levels in response to extracellular signals may have important physiological consequences. In this paper we demonstrate that IL-1 treatment of HepG2 cells causes an inhibition of apoC-III expression. We present evidence that C/EBPδ is the main mediator of the IL-1-dependent down-regulation of apoC-III transcription. We propose a mechanism that involves disruption of the synergistic interactions between enhancer binding factors and HNF-4, as a result of indirect interaction of C/EBPδ with the I element of the apoC-III enhancer.

After capillary transfer onto GeneScreen membranes, the blot was used for hybridization with the cDNA probe encompassing the apoC-III coding region. Hybridization and washings were performed as described previously (44Kritis A.A. Argyrokastritis A. Moschonas N.K. Power S. Katrakili N. Zannis V.I. Cereghini S. Talianidis I. Gene ( Amst .). 1996; 173: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Specific hybridization signals were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by densitometry. Nuclear extracts from HepG2 and COS-1 cells were prepared by a modification of the Dignam method (45Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9157) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (46Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216202) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled by filling in the overhanging ends with Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) in the presence of [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP. DNA binding reactions were performed in 15-μl volume containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 4 mm spermidine, 0.02 mm zinc acetate, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiotreitol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 5–10 μg of nuclear extract. When indicated 100-fold molar excess of cold competitor oligonucleotide was also included. In supershift experiments the nuclear extracts were preincubated with 1 μl (diluted at 1:6 ratio) C/EBPα, C/EBPδ, Sp1 (Santa Cruz), or C/EBPβ and p50 (kindly provided by Sheng-Chung Lee (National University, Taiwan, Republic of China) and A.

For Western blot analysis 50 μg of nuclear extracts or immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 12% polyacrylamide/SDS gel, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with C/EBPδ antibody at 1:200 dilution or 0.5 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20, ICN) as described previously (49Ktistaki E. Ktistakis N.T. Papadogeorgaki E. Talianidis I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9876-9880Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were grown and transfected with the indicated amounts of plasmid constructs together with 3 μg of pCMV-βgal plasmid using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (49Ktistaki E.

Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6492) Google Scholar). In some experiments the cells were treated with 100 ng/ml human recombinant IL-1 (R & D Systems) in serum-free medium 12 h after transfection and grown for additional 24 h before harvest. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activities using constant amounts of protein were determined as described previously (49Ktistaki E. Ktistakis N.T. Papadogeorgaki E. Talianidis I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9876-9880Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 50Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J.

Science. 1985; 230: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and the values were used to normalize variations in the transfection efficiency. Total RNAs from HepG2 cells treated with 100 ng/ml IL-1 for various time intervals were prepared, and Northern blot hybridizations were carried out using the human apoC-III cDNA as a probe. As shown in Fig.1, IL-1 induced a dramatic decrease of apoC-III mRNA. The inhibition was evident as early as 4 h after exposure to IL-1 and continued during the subsequent 48 h to the level of 20% of the control, indicating that apoC-III expression is negatively regulated during IL-1 signal transduction pathway. The effect of IL-1 on the activity of the apoC-III promoter was assessed in transient transfection experiments using the C-III-890-CAT promoter construct. This construct contains all the regulatory elements required for hepatic and intestinal transcription of the apoC-III gene (40Ogami K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Cladaras C. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9808-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Talianidis I. Tambakaki A. Toursounova J. Zannis V.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10298-10309Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). IL-1 treatment of HepG2 cells inhibited apoC-III promoter activity to approximately 39% of the control (Fig.2), suggesting that, at least in part, the specific decrease of apoC-III mRNA levels in response to this cytokine can be ascribed to suppression of apoC-III transcription. To identify the putative mediator of the IL-1-induced repression, we have performed cotransfection experiments using expression vectors for C/EBP and NFκB family members, which have been implicated as the main mediators of IL-1-induced transcription of several genes (6Poli V. Ciliberto G. Tronche F. Yaniv M. Transcriptional Regulation of Liver Specific Genes. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 84-97Google Scholar). C/EBPα and p65 expression vectors had a small (1.5- and 1.3-fold) stimulatory effect, while C/EBPβ and p50 expression vectors did not change apoC-III promoter activity (Fig. 2). On the other hand, overexpression of C/EBPδ decreased apoC-III promoter activity to about 36% of the control (Fig. 2). To identify the putative IL-1 response elements in the apoC-III promoter, we have analyzed the C/EBPδ-dependent transactivation of different deletion mutants. As shown in Fig. 3 A, deletion mutants lacking the entire or part of the apoC-III enhancer (CIII-214-CAT, CIII-686-CAT) were activated 6- and 4-fold by C/EBPδ. These data raised the possibility of two potential response elements that function in an opposite manner: one is located in the proximal promoter region (−214 to + 24 nucleotides) and the other in the distal part of the apoC-III enhancer (−890 to −686 nucleotides). As shown in Fig. 3 B, the deletion mutant lacking site D (CIIIΔD-CAT) was repressed more efficiently by C/EBPδ or IL-1 treatment. On the other hand mutation of the −741 to −747-nt part of the footprint region I (CIII-IM2-CAT) abolished both IL-1-mediated repression and C/EBPδ-mediated transrepression, but no significant change was observed with CIII-IM1-CAT that contains a mutated Sp1 binding site (Fig. 3 B) or constructs containing other enhancer mutations (data not shown). IL-1 treatment further enhanced C/EBPδ-induced repression of the wild type, CIIIΔD and CIII-IM1 mutants by a factor of about 2 (Fig. 3 B), suggesting the importance of an IL-1-dependent modification of C/EBPδ. These data suggest that activated C/EBPδ acts as a negative regulator when it interacts with site I of the upstream apoC-III enhancer, while its potential interaction with proximal element D partially relieves repression. Transfection experiments using chimeric promoter constructs containing three copies of site D, or site I, or the entire apoC-III enhancer in front of the minimal AdML promoter further supported this hypothesis. The 3×D ML-44-CAT reporter gene activity was induced 8-fold by treatment of the cells with IL-1 and 155-fold by cotransfection with C/EBPδ (Fig. 4). In contrast, the apoC-III enhancer-driven activity was inhibited by both IL-1 treatment or overexpression of C/EBPδ to about 45% of the control. Interestingly, the activity of 3×CIII-I ML44 CAT was increased by C/EBPδ cotransfection and IL-1 treatment 31- and 1.9-fold, respectively, showing that CIII-I acts as a negative response element only in the context of the intact enhancer. Therefore, the underlining mechanism must be due to the inhibition of a higher order enhancer complex formed between factors binding to CIII-I and adjacent sites, rather than direct repression resulting from the displacement of another factor binding to CIII-I element.Figure 3The effect of C/EBPδ and IL-1 on the activity of different mutated apoC-III promoters. HepG2 cells were transfected with 2 μg of 5′ deletion (A) and internal (B) mutant promoter constructs shown on the left side and either treated with IL-1 or left untreated.

The data are presented relative to the activity obtained by CIII-890-CAT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Taken together, these results suggest that C/EBPδ is the main mediator of IL-1-dependent inhibition of apoC-III transcription. Although depending on the regulatory region it acts on, C/EBPδ can modulate the apoC-III promoter in both a positive and negative direction; the negative effect brought about by its interaction with the enhancer element I dominates over the positive effect resulting from its binding to the proximal elements D. To determine if in hepatic cells the binding of C/EBP and NFκB factors to site D are induced, mobility shift assays were carried out with extracts prepared from IL-1-treated HepG2 cells. Two major DNA binding activities were detected in untreated cell extracts (CIIID1 and CIIID2), while a novel faster moving complex (CIIID3) was also observed when extracts from IL-1-stimulated cells were analyzed (Fig.5 A). A similar pattern was observed with the AlbD probe (data not shown). We used specific competitors and antibodies recognizing NFκB and C/EBP family proteins to reveal the identity of the different binding activities. The competitor oligonucleotide AlbD (derived from the −115 to −90-nt region of the rat albumin promoter) is a high affinity binding site for C/EBP and does not bind NFκB-related factors (28Brasier A.R. Ron D. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3933-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 47Maire P. Wuarin J. Schibler U. Science. 1989; 244: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The other competitor (IgκB) synthesized from the Ig κ light chain promoter is able to bind proteins that belong to the NFκB family, but not C/EBP-related proteins (48Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar). The formation of the IL-1-induced complex (CIIID3) as well as the two other complexes (CIIID1 and CIIID2) was not inhibited by 100-fold molar excess of IgκB oligonucleotide (Fig.5 B). In addition, antibodies raised against the p50 subunit of NFκB did not affect the electrophoretic mobility profile of CIIID-binding proteins (data not shown), indicating that members of the NFκB family do not bind to site D of the apoC-III promoter in IL-1-induced or uninduced HepG2 cells. The APRF/STAT3 binding site oligonucleotide (α2-macroglobulin) (12Akira S. Nishio Y. Inoue M. Wang X.-J. Wei S. Matsusaka T. Yoshida K. Sudo T. Massanobu M. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1994; 77: 63-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 13Hocke G. Barry D. Fey G.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also failed to prevent the formation of D binding complexes (Fig. 5 B). On the other hand, complete competition of all three DNA binding activities was observed with the AlbD oligonucleotide (Fig.5 B), suggesting that CIIID1, CIIID2, and CIIID3 may represent homo- and heterodimers of C/EBP-related factors. Antibodies specific to individual C/EBP proteins were used in supershift assays to determine which members of this family were involved in complex formation. The C/EBPα-specific antibody supershifted CIIID1 and some of the CIIID2 complex present in both untreated and IL-1 treated HepG2 extracts, but did not affect CIIID3 binding activity (Fig.5 C). Similarly, an antibody to C/EBPβ supershifted only a small amount of CIIID1 protein in both extracts, but not CIIID2 or CIIID3 (Fig. 5 C). The formation of the IL-1-inducible complex (CIIID3) was neutralized only by the antibody raised against C/EBPδ (Fig. 5 C), which did not affect CIIID1 and CIIID2. Therefore, we conclude that in untreated HepG2 cells C/EBPα and C/EBPβ are the main binding activities interacting with the apoC-IIID site, while IL-1 treatment induces the binding of an additional factor which was identified as C/EBPδ. No changes in the steady state protein levels of C/EBPδ were observed between uninduced and IL-1-induced HepG2 cells (Fig.6 A). In addition, we could not detect the existence or induction of a truncated C/EBPδ isoform, suggesting that posttranslational modification may play a role in C/EBPδ activation. Previous studies using the specific tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate have suggested that C/EBPδ may be tyrosine-phosphorylated in BNL CL2 hepatic cells under acute phase conditions (18Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4324-4332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether such modification is induced by IL-1, C/EBPδ was immunoprecipitated from untreated an"

Chem. 272, 23532–23539), we reported the isolation of a series of mutants from the fibroblast-like cell line, CHO-K1, that are deficient in the incorporation of the long chain fatty alcohol, hexadecanol, into complex lipids. All but one of these mutants, FAA.K1B, were deficient in long-chain-fatty alcohol oxidase (FAO) activity. We have further characterized this FAO+ isolate. FAA.K1B cells displayed a 40% decrease in [9,10-3H]hexadecanol uptake when compared with the parent strain. Although incorporation of hexadecanol into the phospholipid fraction was decreased by 52%, the cells accumulated label in alkylglycerol (20-fold over wild type). The increase in 1-alkylglycerol labeling corresponded to a 4-fold increase in alkylglycerol mass. Short term labeling with32Pi showed a 45–50% decrease in overall phospholipid biosynthesis in FAA.K1B. Both diacyl- and ether-linked species were affected, suggesting a general defect in phospholipid biosynthesis. Mutant cells were able to partially compensate for the decreased biosynthesis by decreasing the turnover of the phospholipid pools. The primary lesion in FAA.K1B was identified as a 95% reduction in acyl/alkyl-dihydroxyacetone-phosphate reductase activity. Whole cell homogenates from FAA.K1B were unable to reduce either acyl-dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) or alkyl-DHAP, supporting the notion that the reduction of these two compounds is catalyzed by a single enzyme. These data suggest that the biosynthesis of diacyl phospholipids, in Chinese hamster ovary cells, begins with the acylation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate as well as glycero-3-phosphate and that the “DHAP pathway” contributes significantly to diacyl glycerolipid biosynthesis. Also, the severe reduction in acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase activity in FAA.K1B resulted in only a moderate decrease in ether lipid biosynthesis. These latter data together with the observed increase in alkylglycerol levels support the existence of a shunt pathway that is able to partially bypass the enzymatic lesion.

These latter data together with the observed increase in alkylglycerol levels support the existence of a shunt pathway that is able to partially bypass the enzymatic lesion. The formation of phosphatidic acid is required for the formation of diacyl glycerolipids in both bacterial and animal cells. In bacterial systems, this is initiated with the reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), 1The abbreviations used are: DHAP, dihydroxyacetone-phosphate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; AG, sn-1-alkylglycerol. 1The abbreviations used are: DHAP, dihydroxyacetone-phosphate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; AG, sn-1-alkylglycerol. a product of glycolysis. The resulting sn-glycero-3-phosphate is acylated sequentially at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions to form phosphatidic acid. In animal cells, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) can be acylated directly. In this “DHAP pathway,” the ketone at the sn-2 position of the resultingsn-1-acyl-DHAP must be reduced, by acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase (1Hajra A.K. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 343-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), prior to further acylation. Purified acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase also catalyzes the reduction of the ether-linkedsn-1-alkyl-DHAP (2Datta S.C. Ghosh M.K. Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8268-8274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a reaction that is required in the synthesis of ether-linked glycerolipids, such as plasmenylethanolamine and glyceryl ether diesters (1Hajra A.K. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 343-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). While the acylation of DHAP is accepted as the first step in ether-linked glycerolipids, the importance of the DHAP pathway and acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase in the synthesis of diacyl glycerolipids is in question. It has been estimated that this route is a significant contributor to diacyl glycerolipid synthesis (3Manning R. Brindley D.N. Biochem.

Although it has been purified to homogeneity (2Datta S.C. Ghosh M.K. Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8268-8274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the amino acid sequence for this enzyme has not been determined, the gene has not been isolated, and there is no information concerning how this enzyme is targeted.We have isolated a mutant, FAA.K1B, that displays a general defect in phospholipid biosynthesis and an increase in 1-alkylglycerol levels. Further characterization showed this cell line to be defective in acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase activity. The observation that these mutants were reduced in the biosynthesis of diacyl phospholipids suggests that the DHAP pathway plays a significant role in the production of these lipids in CHO cells. These cells will be useful in investigating the interrelationship between diacyl and ether glycerolipid biosynthesis. This cell line may serve as a tool to isolate a gene that is responsible for acyl/alkyl-DHAP activity and to examine intracellular targeting of this enzyme.DISCUSSIONFAA.K1B is a novel mutant that displayed a severe defect in acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase. This activity catalyzes the third step in biosynthesis of ether-linked glycerolipids (33Snyder F. Lee T.C. Wykle R.L. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1985: 1-58Google Scholar). The loss of this activity resulted in a decrease in the rate of biosynthesis of plasmenylethanolamine, although not to the extent that we would have expected (56% decrease) given a 95% decrease in acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase activity. Lesions in peroxisomal DHAP acyltransferase activity (34Zoeller R.A. Rangaswamy S. Herscovitz H. Rizzo W.B. Hajra A.K. Das A.K. Moser H.W. Moser A. Lazarow P.B. Santos M.J. J. Biol.

The observed accumulation of alkylglycerol in FAA.K1B suggests that these cells were able to partially bypass the reductase lesion through a salvage pathway. 1-Alkyl-DHAP, not reduced by the acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase, would be dephosphorylated, followed by reduction of the resulting 1-alkyldihydroxyacetone, by a separate reductase, to form 1-alkylglycerol. This could then be phosphorylated by a kinase to re-enter the biosynthetic pathway downstream of the acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase as 1-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate. All of these activities have been demonstrated in animal cells (33Snyder F. Lee T.C. Wykle R.L. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1985: 1-58Google Scholar). This salvage pathway, by generating alkylglycerols, could partially bypass the reductase lesion. The addition of high levels of exogenous alkylglycerol to the cells (Fig. 5) was able to more completely bypass the lesion.Acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase can also be used during the synthesis of diacyl glycerolipids (33Snyder F. Lee T.C. Wykle R.L. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1985: 1-58Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of glycerolipids begins by the acylation of either glycero-3-phosphate or dihydroxyacetone phosphate at the sn-1 carbon of the backbone. If glycero-3-phosphate is the initial acyl acceptor, the sn-2 carbon is acylated next, to form phosphatidic acid. If DHAP is acylated (the DHAP pathway) the ketone at the sn-2 carbon must be reduced by the acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase, prior to acylation. Although the role of the reductase in ether lipid biosynthesis is known, there has been some question concerning the importance of the reductase and the DHAP pathway for diacyl glycerolipid biosynthesis (3Manning R. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 1972; 130: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 4Pollock R.J. Hajra A.K. Agranoff B.W. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1984; 259: 9064-9075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The32Pi labeling data (Table III) suggested that, for CHO cells, this pathway is significant. Overall, the rate of phospholipid biosynthesis was reduced by 45%. A decrease in ether lipid biosynthesis, alone, could not account for this decrease. In other ether lipid− mutants (12Nagan N. Hajra A.K. Das A.K. Moser H.W. Moser A. Lazarow P. Purdue P.E. Zoeller R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4475-4480Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13Zoeller R.A. Raetz C.R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5170-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the decrease in ether lipid biosynthesis had no effect on the biosynthetic rates of the head group classes. In fact, the biosynthesis of the diacylated species was increased to compensate for the loss of the ether-linked species.Although the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine was dramatically reduced in FAA.K1B, there was little effect on the biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (Table III). It is well established that the Kennedy-Weiss pathway is the primary pathway for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in CHO cells (35Esko J.D. Raetz C.R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We could, therefore, expect that a partial blockage of phosphatidic acid formation would have an impact upon phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. Phosphatidylethanolamine, on the other hand, can be synthesized through the Kennedy-Weiss pathway, by head group exchange with phosphatidylserine (and phosphatidylcholine), or decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine (36Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24184-24189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Kennedy-Weiss pathway may not be important for phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis. In a CHO mutant strain that displayed a severe defect in diacylglycerol:ethanolamine phosphotransferase, part of the Kennedy-Weiss pathway, the biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine was not greatly affected over an 8-h period, cell growth was relatively unaffected, and phosphatidylethanolamine levels were decreased by only 19% (37Polokoff M.A. Wing D.C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7687-7690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, CHO mutants, defective in head group exchange activity, showed a marked decrease in phosphatidylethanolamine levels (38Voelker D.R. Frasier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1002-1008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1926-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).If acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase is important for diacyl glycerolipid synthesis we might have expected to see increased levels of monoacylglycerol in the mutants, similar to the increased levels of alkylglycerol, However monoacylglycerol levels remained relatively unaffected. This may be due to the susceptibility of monoacylglycerols to degradation by lipases that are unable to cleave the ether bond but are active on ester linkages. Other laboratories have noted the relative metabolic stability of 1-alkylglycerol (40Rock C.O. Snyder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5382-5387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 1-alkyl-2-acylglycerol (41Ford D.A. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12280-12286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) when compared with 1-monoacylglycerol and diacylglycerol.Surprisingly, the decrease in phospholipid biosynthesis did not appear to affect the growth of FAA.K1B (data not shown) or the ability of these cells to synthesize DNA and protein (Table VI). Also, the phospholipid content was only slightly affected. The mutant cells appear to have, at least partially, compensated for the biosynthetic lesion by decreasing phospholipid turnover (Fig. 4 B). Decreased phospholipid turnover has been reported in other phospholipid biosynthesis mutants (38Voelker D.R. Frasier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1002-1008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Nishijima M. Kuge O. Maeda M. Nakano A. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7101-7108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To some extent, the cells may have also been able to utilize phospholipid from the medium. Conditionally lethal mutants, displaying severe decreases in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine, could be rescued by supplementation of the medium with the affected phospholipids (38Voelker D.R. Frasier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1002-1008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S.

Enough phospholipid may be found in the serum used to supplement the medium to compensate for a partial loss in phospholipid biosynthesis in FAA.K1B. We have observed that FAA.K1B is unable to grow in serum-free medium, but we have been unable to rescue this cell line with lipid supplementation. 2R. A. Zoeller, unpublished data. We cannot, therefore, identify any lipid or lipids as the crucial ingredient in the serum.Table VIProtein and DNA synthesis in CHO-K1 and FAA.K1BIncorporation of label into TCA-insoluble material[35S]Methionine[3H]Thymidinecpm/mg proteinCHO-K112.6 ± 0.42.89 ± 0.70FAA.K1B11.9 ± 1.63.55 ± 0.25Protein and DNA synthesis were monitored by measuring the incorporation of [35S]methionine and [3H]thymidine, respectively, into trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-insoluble material as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All values represent the average ± S.D. of three samples. Open table in a new tab FAA.K1B is the first animal cell mutant to be described that is defective in a step in diacyl glycerolipid biosynthesis prior to the formation of phosphatidate, and it is defective in the first common step in the pathways for ether-linked and diacyl glycerolipid biosynthesis. Mutants such as these should help to examine the relationship between these two classes of lipid. The formation of phosphatidic acid is required for the formation of diacyl glycerolipids in both bacterial and animal cells. In bacterial systems, this is initiated with the reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), 1The abbreviations used are: DHAP, dihydroxyacetone-phosphate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; AG, sn-1-alkylglycerol. 1The abbreviations used are: DHAP, dihydroxyacetone-phosphate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; AG, sn-1-alkylglycerol. a product of glycolysis. The resulting sn-glycero-3-phosphate is acylated sequentially at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions to form phosphatidic acid. In animal cells, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) can be acylated directly. In this “DHAP pathway,” the ketone at the sn-2 position of the resultingsn-1-acyl-DHAP must be reduced, by acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase (1Hajra A.K. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 343-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), prior to further acylation. Purified acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase also catalyzes the reduction of the ether-linkedsn-1-alkyl-DHAP (2Datta S.C. Ghosh M.K. Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8268-8274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a reaction that is required in the synthesis of ether-linked glycerolipids, such as plasmenylethanolamine and glyceryl ether diesters (1Hajra A.K. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 343-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). While the acylation of DHAP is accepted as the first step in ether-linked glycerolipids, the importance of the DHAP pathway and acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase in the synthesis of diacyl glycerolipids is in question. It has been estimated that this route is a significant contributor to diacyl glycerolipid synthesis (3Manning R. Brindley D.N. Biochem.

Although it has been purified to homogeneity (2Datta S.C. Ghosh M.K. Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8268-8274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the amino acid sequence for this enzyme has not been determined, the gene has not been isolated, and there is no information concerning how this enzyme is targeted. We have isolated a mutant, FAA.K1B, that displays a general defect in phospholipid biosynthesis and an increase in 1-alkylglycerol levels. Further characterization showed this cell line to be defective in acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase activity. The observation that these mutants were reduced in the biosynthesis of diacyl phospholipids suggests that the DHAP pathway plays a significant role in the production of these lipids in CHO cells. These cells will be useful in investigating the interrelationship between diacyl and ether glycerolipid biosynthesis. This cell line may serve as a tool to isolate a gene that is responsible for acyl/alkyl-DHAP activity and to examine intracellular targeting of this enzyme. DISCUSSIONFAA.K1B is a novel mutant that displayed a severe defect in acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase. This activity catalyzes the third step in biosynthesis of ether-linked glycerolipids (33Snyder F. Lee T.C. Wykle R.L. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1985: 1-58Google Scholar). The loss of this activity resulted in a decrease in the rate of biosynthesis of plasmenylethanolamine, although not to the extent that we would have expected (56% decrease) given a 95% decrease in acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase activity. Lesions in peroxisomal DHAP acyltransferase activity (34Zoeller R.A. Rangaswamy S. Herscovitz H. Rizzo W.B. Hajra A.K. Das A.K. Moser H.W. Moser A. Lazarow P.B. Santos M.J. J. Biol.

Overall, the rate of phospholipid biosynthesis was reduced by 45%. A decrease in ether lipid biosynthesis, alone, could not account for this decrease. In other ether lipid− mutants (12Nagan N. Hajra A.K. Das A.K. Moser H.W. Moser A. Lazarow P. Purdue P.E. Zoeller R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4475-4480Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13Zoeller R.A. Raetz C.R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5170-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the decrease in ether lipid biosynthesis had no effect on the biosynthetic rates of the head group classes. In fact, the biosynthesis of the diacylated species was increased to compensate for the loss of the ether-linked species. Although the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine was dramatically reduced in FAA.K1B, there was little effect on the biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (Table III). It is well established that the Kennedy-Weiss pathway is the primary pathway for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in CHO cells (35Esko J.D. Raetz C.R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We could, therefore, expect that a partial blockage of phosphatidic acid formation would have an impact upon phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. Phosphatidylethanolamine, on the other hand, can be synthesized through the Kennedy-Weiss pathway, by head group exchange with phosphatidylserine (and phosphatidylcholine), or decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine (36Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24184-24189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Kennedy-Weiss pathway may not be important for phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis. In a CHO mutant strain that displayed a severe defect in diacylglycerol:ethanolamine phosphotransferase, part of the Kennedy-Weiss pathway, the biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine was not greatly affected over an 8-h period, cell growth was relatively unaffected, and phosphatidylethanolamine levels were decreased by only 19% (37Polokoff M.A. Wing D.C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7687-7690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, CHO mutants, defective in head group exchange activity, showed a marked decrease in phosphatidylethanolamine levels (38Voelker D.R. Frasier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1002-1008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1926-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). If acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase is important for diacyl glycerolipid synthesis we might have expected to see increased levels of monoacylglycerol in the mutants, similar to the increased levels of alkylglycerol, However monoacylglycerol levels remained relatively unaffected. This may be due to the susceptibility of monoacylglycerols to degradation by lipases that are unable to cleave the ether bond but are active on ester linkages. Other laboratories have noted the relative metabolic stability of 1-alkylglycerol (40Rock C.O. Snyder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5382-5387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 1-alkyl-2-acylglycerol (41Ford D.A. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12280-12286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) when compared with 1-monoacylglycerol and diacylglycerol. Surprisingly, the decrease in phospholipid biosynthesis did not appear to affect the growth of FAA.K1B (data not shown) or the ability of these cells to synthesize DNA and protein (Table VI). Also, the phospholipid content was only slightly affected. The mutant cells appear to have, at least partially, compensated for the biosynthetic lesion by decreasing phospholipid turnover (Fig. 4 B). Decreased phospholipid turnover has been reported in other phospholipid biosynthesis mutants (38Voelker D.R. Frasier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1002-1008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Nishijima M. Kuge O. Maeda M. Nakano A. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7101-7108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To some extent, the cells may have also been able to utilize phospholipid from the medium. Conditionally lethal mutants, displaying severe decreases in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine, could be rescued by supplementation of the medium with the affected phospholipids (38Voelker D.R. Frasier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1002-1008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S.

Enough phospholipid may be found in the serum used to supplement the medium to compensate for a partial loss in phospholipid biosynthesis in FAA.K1B. We have observed that FAA.K1B is unable to grow in serum-free medium, but we have been unable to rescue this cell line with lipid supplementation. 2R. A. Zoeller, unpublished data. We cannot, therefore, identify any lipid or lipids as the crucial ingredient in the serum. Protein and DNA synthesis were monitored by measuring the incorporation of [35S]methionine and [3H]thymidine, respectively, into trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-insoluble material as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All values represent the average ± S.D. of three samples. FAA.K1B is the first animal cell mutant to be described that is defective in a step in diacyl glycerolipid biosynthesis prior to the formation of phosphatidate, and it is defective in the first common step in the pathways for ether-linked and diacyl glycerolipid biosynthesis. Mutants such as these should help to examine the relationship between these two classes of lipid."

Often, communication between them can be mediated by soluble growth mediators and in some cases is restricted in focus. That is, some cells respond to, but do not produce, mediators expressed by other cells within the tissue. Because keratinocytes respond to but do not express insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), another skin cell population, the dermal fibroblast, may supply this factor. However, keratinocytes express, but do not respond to parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrp), which increases cAMP production by dermal fibroblasts. Based on earlier results where inducers of cAMP increase local IGF-I expression in skeletal tissue, we postulated that PTHrp might induce local IGF-I by dermal fibroblasts and provide a source of this factor for keratinocyte activity. Our studies reveal that IGF-I mRNA and protein levels increase in response to PTHrp in vitro, and that this effect is replicated by inducers of cAMP, but not by activators of protein kinase C. Consequently, these factors appear to comprise a paracrine loop within the skin, permitting focused but restricted IGF-I expression to support skin growth, remodeling, or repair.

In skin, IGF-I induces keratinocyte replication and skin matrix protein synthesis (2Neely E.K. Morhenn V.B. Hintz R.L. Wilson D.M. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 96: 104-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, keratinocytes do not express detectable amounts of IGF-I and may rely on the circulation, or perhaps expression by other local skin cells, for a supply of this factor (3Barreca A. DeLuca M.

In contrast, keratinocytes express another growth regulator, parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrp), which shares amino-terminal sequence homology with PTH and acts at least in part through conventional PTH receptors (5Centrella M. Canalis E. McCarthy T.L. Orloff J.J. Stewart A.F. Insogna K.L. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 6Orloff J.J. Reddy D. DePapp A.E. Yang K.H. Soifer N.E. Stewart A.F. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 40-60PubMed Google Scholar). PTHrp was first purified from squamous cell tumors where it was implicated in the paraneoplastic syndrome, humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. It is a highly conserved and ubiquitous protein with many effects in a broad range of tissues (reviewed in Refs. 6Orloff J.J. Reddy D. DePapp A.E. Yang K.H. Soifer N.E. Stewart A.F. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 40-60PubMed Google Scholar and 7Dunbar M.E. Wysolmerski J.J. Broadus A.E. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1996; 312: 287-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our earlier studies first demonstrated that IGF-I expression is enhanced by PTH, PTHrp, prostaglandin E2, and other inducers of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in osteoblasts (8McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 1247-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 9McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Canalis E. J. Biol.

Despite the assumption that skin, and dermis in particular, is not a primary target organ for PTH, receptors shared by PTH and PTHrp are clearly present on dermal fibroblasts (11Goldring S.R.

Milstone L.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 548: 146-149Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulated that keratinocyte-derived PTHrp might act as a local regulator in skin in a manner similar to that by circulating PTH in the skeleton. In this study we asked specifically if PTHrp could increase IGF-I production by fetal dermal fibroblasts through a cAMP-dependent pathway. In this way, keratinocytes might support dermal fibroblast function through the action of PTHrp, and as a result dermal fibroblasts could support keratinocyte activity through an increase in IGF-I expression. Fibroblasts were isolated from the forehead skin of 22-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat fetuses (Charles River Breeding Laboratories) using procedures approved by the Yale University Animal Care and Use Committee. As in earlier studies (15Centrella M. Kim J. Pham T. Casinghino S. Rosen V. Wozney J. McCarthy T.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3273-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), skin flaps were incubated for 30 min with collagenase (600 μg/ml preincubated with tosylchloromethyl ketone to inhibit residual clostripain activity (Worthington Biochemical Co.)). Cells were collected by centrifugation and plated in Dulbecco's modified culture medium supplemented with 20 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.2), 100 μg/ml ascorbic acid, penicillin, and streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 3 days. Stock cultures were dispersed with trypsin for 1–2 passages, and plated in 9.6-cm2 cultures where virtually all cells displayed typical fibroblast morphology.

Data were analyzed in multiple samples after multiple determinations and where appropriate are expressed as means ± S.E. In experiments that compared more than one variable or treatment group, statistical differences were assessed by analysis of variance with limits set by the Student-Newman-Keuls' test. In experiments where a single group was compared with control, analysis defaulted to the Student's t test. Comparisons were performed with a commercial statistical software package (SigmaStat®). Differences among groups were considered significant when pvalues were <0.05. PTHrp caused rapid, time-, and dose-dependent increases in cAMP accumulation in the dermal fibroblast cultures. At 10–30 nm PTHrp, there was a maximal 8-fold to 10-fold increase in cAMP that occurred within 1–5 min of treatment and regressed by 15 min. Basal cAMP levels were reduced in the absence of isobutylmethylxanthine, suggesting an active conventional phosphodiesterase system for normal cAMP turnover in these cells. Treatment with the phorbol ester PMA had no effect on cAMP levels, whereas forskolin was stimulatory (Fig.1). In parallel cultures, cAMP was similarly increased by treatment with two other positive control reagents, isoproterenol (7.5 ± 0.5-fold) and prostaglandin E2 (12.4 ± 3.4-fold). PTHrp also induced time- and dose-dependent increases in IGF-I expression. A 1.7–2-fold increase in immunoreactive IGF-I (iIGF-I) polypeptide was secreted within 24 h of treatment with 30 nm PTHrp (Fig.2 a) and persisted for 48–72 h (data not shown). Similar to their effects on cAMP accumulation, treatment with forskolin enhanced iIGF-I secretion, whereas PMA did not (Fig. 2 b). As shown in Fig. 3, dermal fibroblasts exhibit a complex IGF-I transcript pattern with predominate bands at 6.5, 4.1, 1.7, and 0.9 kb, analogous to that previously found in fetal rat bone cells (8McCarthy T.L.

Consistent with their effects on cAMP and iIGF-I polypeptide, forskolin increased steady state IGF-I transcripts, and PMA had no effect. Next, the cultures were treated for 6 h with control medium or with PTHrp to induce IGF-I mRNA and then supplemented with DRB for the next 24 h to suppress new mRNA transcription (18Bichell D.P. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1020-1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22McCarthy T.L. Casinghino S. Mittanck D.W. Ji C.-H. Centrella M. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6666-6671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). IGF-I transcripts decreased throughout the 24 h period of DRB treatment in control cultures. In contrast, the stimulatory effect of PTHrp persisted for the next 6 h and was still moderately elevated even 24 h after DRB exposure, indicating that PTHrp enhanced IGF-I mRNA stability.Figure 3PTHrp increases IGF-I transcript levels in fetal rat dermal fibroblasts. In the left panel, confluent cultures were treated for 6 h with control medium (CON), 10 nm PTHrp, 10 μmforskolin (FORSK), or 1 μm PMA. In theright panel, cultures were treated for 6 h with 10 nm PTHrp and then supplemented with DRB for the times indicated. RNA was extracted and assessed by Northern analysis. Similar effects by PTHrp occurred in two other studies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Unlike their effects on IGF-I expression, PTHrp and forskolin did not enhance DNA synthesis, collagen synthesis, or general noncollagen protein synthesis by dermal fibroblasts, whereas PMA increased each of these biochemical activities (Fig. 4). Therefore, the effects of the cAMP stimulators on IGF-I expression appeared selective, and the fibroblasts were able to respond to PMA in other ways. Studies with a probe that distinguishes the use of two separate gene promoters for IGF-I transcription (18Bichell D.P. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1020-1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that only promoter 1 drove IGF-I expression in fetal rat dermal fibroblasts. Several larger protected bands of 202–243 nucleotides in length, corresponding to the use of promoter 2 in rat liver, were not evident with RNA from control or treated dermal fibroblasts. A prominent smaller protected band of 143 nucleotides, corresponding to transcripts initiated from promoter 1, was enhanced by PTHrp and forskolin, but not by PMA (Fig.5). To locate the minimal region of promoter 1 required for IGF-I expression in the dermal fibroblast cultures, they were transfected with various IGF-I promoter/reporter plasmid constructs truncated from the 5′ or 3′ ends (21McCarthy T.L. Thomas M.J. Centrella M. Rotwein P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Negligible reporter gene was expressed using the 4.3-kb fragment of IGF-I promoter DNA, and maximal activity occurred with a 5′ truncated fragment of 1.7 kb (Fig. 6 a). An important enhancer element occurs within exon 1 at nucleotides +202 to +209 (23Thomas M.J. Umayahara Y. Shu H. Centrella M. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21835-21841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, when 3′ sequences from exon 1 encompassing this site were removed from the active 1.7 kb upstream promoter sequence, basal promoter activity in dermal fibroblasts was reduced (Fig.6 b). Therefore, basal IGF-I promoter activity in fetal rat dermal fibroblast cultures is fully consistent with its expression in fetal rat osteoblasts (21McCarthy T.L. Thomas M.J. Centrella M. Rotwein P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in striking contrast to the changes that occur in osteoblasts, no stimulator of cAMP enhanced the activity of any promoter construct that we tested. In this context, we examined the maximally active 1.7-kb constructs truncated from the 5′ and 3′ ends to eliminate possible suppressor sequences and compared effects by PTHrp with dibutyryl cAMP, isoproterenol, and PMA, and invariably found no significant variations (Fig. 6, panels a-c).Figure 6PTHrp does not increase IGF-I promoter 1 activity in fetal rat dermal fibroblasts. Subconfluent cultures were transfected with various plasmid constructs that include portions of the IGF-I promoter deleted sequentially from the 5′ end at positions −4250 through −122 (panels a and c), from the 3′ end at positions +117 through +328 (panel b), or the inverted promoter construct 1114rev (panel a), as reported previously (see Ref. 21McCarthy T.L. Thomas M.J. Centrella M. Rotwein P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured to confluence and treated for 6 h with control medium (CONTROL) or with 10 nm PTHrp (panels a, b, andc), or with 100 μm dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP), 10 μm isoproterenol (ISOPRO), or 1 μm PMA (panel c). Luciferase activity was measured in the cytoplasmic extracts, evaluated for transfection efficiency by co-expression of a β-galactosidase reporter construct, and corrected for protein content.

Often these interactions are dependent on the effects of local or systemic growth factors. Paracrine factors appear to influence skin cell metabolism (24Cook P.W. Pittelkow M.R. Shipley G.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 146: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and of these IGF-I is thought to have an integral role (2Neely E.K. Morhenn V.B. Hintz R.L. Wilson D.M. Rosenfeld R.G. J.

Initial studies demonstrated that an epithelial component of skin, keratinocytes, do not express detectable levels of IGFs, but can respond to the IGFs released from co-cultured mesenchymal fibroblasts (3Barreca A.

Previous studies revealed an increase in PTHrp expression by keratinocytes in response to serum factors or to fibroblast-derived culture medium (31Insogna K.L. Stewart A.F. Morris C.A. Hough L.M. Milstone L.M. Centrella M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1057-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 32Hoekman K. Lowik C.W. vanderRuit M. Kempenaar J. Bijvoet O.L. Ponec M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 3589-3594PubMed Google Scholar), predicting interactions between these cell populations through soluble mediators. Furthermore, in cultures of BEN squamous carcinoma cells, PTHrp production is regulated by several factors including IGF-I and IGF-II (33Rizzoli R. Feyen J.H. Grau G. Wohlwend A. Sappino A.P. Bonjour J.P. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 143: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Skin fibroblasts express a common receptor shared by PTH and PTHrp and produce cAMP in response to these hormones (11Goldring S.R. Mahaffey J.E. Krane S.M. Potts J.T. Dayer J.M. Rosenblatt M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1979; 48: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12Silve C. Santora A. Spiegel A. J. Clin.

Endocrinol. & Metab. 1987; 65: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, keratinocytes fail to respond to these hormones and accordingly exhibit undetectable levels of mRNA for the conventional PTH/PTHrp receptor that is coupled to cAMP generation (34Hanafin N.M. Chen T.C. Heinrich G. Segre G.V. Holick M.F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 133-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 35Orloff J.J. Kats Y. Urena P. Schipani E. Vasavada R.C. Philbrick W.M. Behal A. Abou-Samra A.B. Segre G.V. Juppner H. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3016-3023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We initially reported that all inducers of cAMP, including PTH and PTHrp, increase IGF-I expression by differentiated osteoblasts (8McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 1247-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 9McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Canalis E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15353-15356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Raisz L.G. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2895-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). For these reasons, we postulated that keratinocyte-derived PTHrp might promote IGF-I expression by skin fibroblasts and in this way complete a paracrine loop within skin and support keratinocyte metabolism. A model for these interactions is shown in Fig. 7. Our current studies confirm the potent effect of PTHrp on cAMP production in dermal fibroblasts and now demonstrate its ability to enhance IGF-I secretion and steady state mRNA levels by these cells. In addition, IGF-I expression was also enhanced by other cAMP stimulators but not by PMA, indicating protein kinase A-dependent mechanisms. This differs from the protein kinase C-dependent permissive effect of growth hormone in liver cells that may respond similarly to cAMP (36Tollet P.C. Legraverend C. Gustafsson J.A. Mode A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1351-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We found an early and transient increase in IGF-I mRNA in PTHrp-induced dermal fibroblasts. IGF-I mRNA levels remained high in PTHrp treated cultures in the presence of DRB, consistent with mRNA stabilization. However, we saw no change in IGF-I promoter activation, which directly contrasts with our results in osteoblasts (18Bichell D.P. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1020-1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21McCarthy T.L. Thomas M.J. Centrella M. Rotwein P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By gel shift analysis with nuclear extracts from cAMP-stimulated osteoblasts, we recently detected large molecular mass complexes of nuclear factors that associate with specific sequences of the IGF-I promoter (23Thomas M.J. Umayahara Y. Shu H. Centrella M. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21835-21841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and find that a subset of these complexes is missing in control and treated dermal fibroblasts. 2C. Ji, T. L. McCarthy, and M. Centrella, unpublished observations. This suggests that some endogenous or cAMP-activated nuclear factors expressed by osteoblasts may be lacking in dermal fibroblasts. Therefore, although steady state IGF-I mRNA is enhanced by cAMP stimulators in both dermal and skeletal cells, it appears to be through different mechanisms in each tissue. An increase in IGF-I in response to PTHrp may stimulate additional keratinocyte growth or subsequent matrix synthesis. Interactions of this sort between the epithelium and mesenchymal cells is consistent with a role for PTHrp in many tissues (7Dunbar M.E. Wysolmerski J.J. Broadus A.E. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1996; 312: 287-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization studies in embryologic tissue localize PTHrp and its receptors to the interface between these two tissue types (37Lee K. Deeds J.D. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 453-463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of PTHrp as a local paracrine factor in skin is consistent with results from the transgenic mouse targeted to overexpress PTHrp in this tissue. In these animals the dermis and the epidermis are disrupted and there is abnormal development of hair follicles (38Wysolmerski J.J. Broadus A.E. Zhou J. Fuchs E. Milstone L.M. Philbrick W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Our current studies suggest that changes in local IGF-I expression may account in part for these effects, and that imbalances may occur when normal regulatory processes in skin are subverted by local overexpression of PTHrp. Analogous to other events that occur in skeletal cells, increases in cAMP may also alter fibroblast IGF-binding protein expression. In so doing, these changes could enhance or inhibit IGF activity (39Centrella M. Spinelli H.M. Persing J.A. McCarthy T.L. Ann. Plast. Surg. 1993; 31: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this regard, our initial results suggest that activators of the cAMP and PKC pathways induce different effects in cultured skin and bone cells (22McCarthy T.L. Casinghino S. Mittanck D.W. Ji C.-H.

Further studies to determine the mechanisms by which these factors are expressed and necessarily suppressed under normal conditions may enhance our ability to focus on molecular events that can more efficiently control skin growth and repair.

(EC1.1.1.40) catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate and CO2, simultaneously generating NADPH from NADP+. In avian liver, most of the NADPH used in thede novo synthesis of long chain fatty acids is generated by malic enzyme (1Goodridge A.G. Biochem. J. 1968; 108: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Malic enzyme is a typical lipogenic enzyme; its activity in avian liver increases about 70-fold when newly hatched chicks are fed a diet high in carbohydrate (1Goodridge A.G. Biochem. J. 1968; 108: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and decreases dramatically when animals are starved (2Goodridge A.G. Biochem. J. 1968; 108: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In chicken embryo hepatocytes in culture, insulin plus T3 causes about a 50-fold increase in malic enzyme activity and abundance of its mRNA; glucagon or cAMP blocks these effects (3Goodridge A.G. Adelman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3027-3032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Salati L.M. Ma X.-J. McCormick C.C. Stapleton S.R. Goodridge A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4010-4016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within 1 h after adding T3 to chick embryo hepatocytes, transcription of the malic enzyme gene increases by 30–40-fold; cAMP completely inhibits this increase (4Salati L.M. Ma X.-J. McCormick C.C. Stapleton S.R. Goodridge A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4010-4016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The T3-dependent increase in transcription of the malic enzyme gene is mediated by several T3 response elements (T3REs), with the major one between −3883 and −3858 bp upstream of the start site for transcription (5Hodnett D.W. Fantozzi D.A. Thurmond D.C. Klautky S.A. MacPhee K.G. Estrem S.T. Xu G. Goodridge A.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Several positive acting cAMP response elements have been described (6Delmas V. Molina C.A. Lalli E. deGroot R. Foulkes N.S. Masquilier D. Sassone-Corsi P. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 124: 1-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP stimulates gene expression by activating protein kinase A (PKA), which, in turn, phosphorylates members of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors, thereby increasing their transactivation potential (7Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13716-13723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The CREB/ATF family includes polypeptides encoded by at least seven distinct genes (6Delmas V. Molina C.A. Lalli E. deGroot R. Foulkes N.S. Masquilier D. Sassone-Corsi P. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 124: 1-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that share the ability to bind, with different affinities, to CREs in the 5′-flanking DNA of genes activated by cAMP. The CREB/ATF proteins also dimerize with AP1 proteins, members of another family of leucine zipper proteins (8Benbrook D.M. Jones N.C. Oncogenes. 1990; 5: 295-302PubMed Google Scholar) for which the binding site differs from a consensus CRE by only one bp (9Angel P. Karin M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3237) Google Scholar). Much less is known about negative-acting cAMP-response elements. In the gene for L-type pyruvate kinase, the L4 element, −168 to −144 bp, binds major late transcription factor; it is the glucose/insulin response element and is required for inhibition by cAMP. Inhibition by cAMP also requires the contiguous L3 element, an element that binds hepatic nuclear factor 4 (10Bergot M.O. Diaz-Guerra M.J.M. Puzenat N. Raymondjean M. Khan A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1871-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP also inhibits transcription of the genes for IL-2 and IL-2R in EL4 cells; the inhibition requires an AP1 site. In this case, cAMP increases the binding of Jun/Fos heterodimers to the AP1 site and alters the composition of Jun proteins that participate in the AP1 complex (11Tamir A. Isakov N. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3391-3399PubMed Google Scholar). A third example of inhibition of transcription by cAMP involves the hepatic gene for fatty acid synthase; insulin-induced transcription of this gene is inhibited by cAMP (12Paulauskis J.D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 574-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cis-acting element required for the inhibitory effect is an inverted CAAT box (13Rangan V.S. Oskouian B. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2307-2312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The proteins that bind to this element have not been identified. In this study, we have found that the 5′-flanking DNA of the gene for malic enzyme contains at least four cis-acting DNA sequences that are involved in responsiveness to the inhibitory action of cAMP. We have examined the function of the probable major inhibitory element and identified some of the nuclear proteins that bind to it. Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) or Boehringer Mannheim. Other enzymes were obtained from the indicated sources: Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), T4 DNA ligase (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and calf intestinal phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim). CPT-cAMP, 3,5,3′-l-triiodothyronine, and corticosterone were purchased from Sigma. Crystalline bovine insulin was a gift from Lilly. LipofectAceTM and Waymouth medium MD 705/1 were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. [α-32P]dCTP (800 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Corp., andd-threo-[dichloroacetyl-1–2-14C]chloramphenicol was from NEN Life Science Products. d-Luciferin, potassium salt, was obtained from Analytical Luminescence Laboratory (San Diego, CA). Antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); all were raised against human protein except TRα, for which the antigen was chicken in origin. All other chemicals were of reagent grade or of the highest purity commercially available. Plasmid RSV-PKAc and pRSV-PKi were from R. A. Maurer (Oregon Health Sciences University) (14Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6870-6873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid RSV-TRα was provided by H. H. Samuels (New York University) (15Samuels H.H. Forman B.M. Horowitz Z.D. Ye Z.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The luciferase reporter plasmid, pXP1 (16Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar), was from S. K. Nordeen (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center). Plasmid RSV-LUC was constructed as described previously (5Hodnett D.W. Fantozzi D.A. Thurmond D.C. Klautky S.A. MacPhee K.G. Estrem S.T. Xu G. Goodridge A.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). B. Luckow and G. Schutz (Heidelberg, Germany) provided pBLCAT2 (Ref. 17Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 17: 2365Google Scholar; pTKCAT). Plasmid KSCAT (promoterless plasmid), p[ME−5800/+31]CAT, and the 5′-deletions thereof were constructed as described previously (5Hodnett D.W. Fantozzi D.A. Thurmond D.C. Klautky S.A. MacPhee K.G. Estrem S.T. Xu G. Goodridge A.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For the TK constructs, we inserted various fragments of ME 5′-flanking DNA into the multiple cloning site 5′ of the HSV TK promoter in pBLCAT2 (Ref. 17Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 17: 2365Google Scholar; TKCAT). Plasmid [ME-T3RE2]TKCAT was constructed by inserting a 36-bp oligonucleotide containing T3RE2 (major T3RE) of the malic enzyme gene (5Hodnett D.W. Fantozzi D.A. Thurmond D.C. Klautky S.A. MacPhee K.G. Estrem S.T. Xu G. Goodridge A.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) into the NdeI and HindIII sites of pTKCAT. To make p[ME(T3RE2)−1713/−944]TKCAT and p[ME(T3RE2)−413/−147]TKCAT, we first amplified the −1713 to −944 and −413 to −147 fragments by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides containing BamHI sites and then subcloned the resulting fragments into the BamHI site of p[ME-T3RE2]TKCAT. For p[ME−3474/−2715]TKCAT, we isolated the −3474 to −2715 fragment from p[ME−5800/+31]CAT by digesting withBglII. After blunt ending with T4 DNA polymerase, the resulting mixture was digested with HindIII. The resulting 758-bp fragment was subcloned into pTKCAT that had been digested byBamHI, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and digested by HindIII. Plasmid [ME−3474/−2715(Δ−3259/−3115)]TKCAT and p[ME−3474/−2715(Δ−3114/−2930)]TKCAT were obtained using the TransformerTM site-directed mutagenesis kit fromCLONTECH Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 30-bp mutant primers contained two 15-bp sequences corresponding to each of the flanking regions of the internal deletions. Plasmid [ME−3474/−2715]TKCAT was the target. Plasmid [ME−3474/−2715(Δ−3474/−3260)]TKCAT and p[ME−3474/−2715(Δ−2929/−2715)]TKCAT were constructed using polymerase chain reaction and p[ME−3474/−2715]TKCAT as template. For p[ME−3474/−2715(Δ−3474/−3260)]TKCAT, the 5′-primer was a 30-bp oligonucleotide that contained two 15-bp sequences corresponding to the flanking regions of the deletion and aHindIII restriction site. The 3′-primer contained the last 24 bp of the −3474 to −2715 fragment and a BamHI site. For p[ME−3474/−2715(Δ−2929/−2715)]TKCAT, the 5′-primer contained the first 24 nucleotides of the −3474 to −2715 fragment and aHindIII site. The 3′-primer was 30 bp in length and contained two 15-bp oligonucleotides that flanked the deletion and aBamHI site. After digestion with the appropriate enzymes, the polymerase chain reaction fragments were subcloned into TKCAT. Plasmid [ME(T3RE2)−3259/−3115]TKCAT and p[ME−3114/−2930]TKCAT were constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of malic enzyme sequences using oligonucleotides with HindIII andBamHI sites. The resulting fragments were then subcloned into p[ME-T3RE2]TKCAT or pBLCAT2, respectively, which had been digested by the appropriate enzymes. 5′-deletions of p[ME(T3RE2)−3259/−3115]TKCAT were obtained using essentially the same procedure. Wild-type and mutant forms of p[ME(T3RE2)−3192/−3158]TKCAT were constructed by subcloning 34-bp oligonucleotides, flanked with HindIII and BamHI sites, into p[ME-T3RE2]TKCAT. Sequences of all constructs were confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis using the Sequenase DNA sequencing kit (version 2.0, U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Isolated hepatocytes were prepared from the livers of 19-day-old chick embryos (18Roncero C. Goodridge A.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 258-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated in 35-mm plates with Waymouth medium MD 705/1 and streptomycin (100 μg/ml), penicillin G (60 μg/ml), insulin (50 nm), and corticosterone (1 μm). After 16–24 h, the cells were transfected with p[ME−5800/+31]CAT (2.5 μg) or an equimolar amount of another reporter plasmid, pRSV-LUC (0.5 μg) and sufficient pBluescript to bring the total amount of transfected DNA to 5 μg/plate. The cells were incubated with the DNA/lipofectACETM mixture for 16–24 h; thereafter, the medium was replaced with fresh medium with or without T3 (1.6 μm) and with or without CPT-cAMP (500 μm). After an additional 48 h of incubation, the hepatocytes were harvested, and extracts were prepared (5Hodnett D.W. Fantozzi D.A. Thurmond D.C. Klautky S.A. MacPhee K.G. Estrem S.T. Xu G. Goodridge A.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A detailed description of our transfection procedures has been published (19Baillie R.B. Klautky S.A. Goodridge A.G. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1992; 4: 431-439Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were analyzed for protein quantity (20Sedmark J.J. Grossberg S.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2471) Google Scholar), luciferase activity (21DeWet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2466) Google Scholar), and CAT activity (22Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar). The results were expressed initially as percentage of substrate converted to acetylated product per milligram of unheated soluble protein and then normalized as described in the figure legends. The ratio of average relative CAT activities with and without T3 or cAMP is not always the same as the corresponding average -fold changes in CAT activities or percentages of control activities, respectively, because the latter are the averages of the individual -fold changes or percentages of control activities for each experiment. The statistical significance of differences between pairs of means was determined by the Wilcoxon matched pairs, signed rank test (23Conover W. Practical Non-parametric Statistics.2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, NY1980Google Scholar). Standard errors of the mean are provided to indicate the degree of variability in the data. Nuclear extracts were prepared (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 1.1-16.20Google Scholar) from chick embryo hepatocytes incubated for 48 h with insulin, corticosterone, and T3 with or without CPT-cAMP. The extraction buffer contained 0.6 m KCl and the protease inhibitors leupeptin, benzamidine, aprotinin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled by a fill-in reaction with [α-32P]dCTP catalyzed by the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. A volume of nuclear extract containing 6 μg of protein was mixed with 12 μl of binding buffer containing 20,000 cpm of 32P-labeled probe, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.8 μg of bovine serum albumin, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 5 μg of salmon sperm DNA with or without a 100-fold molar excess of competitor oligonucleotide. The reaction was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Antibody experiments used the same incubation conditions except that 1 μl of IgG (1 μg) was incubated with the reaction mixture for an additional 15 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then subjected to electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gels at 150 V in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.19m glycine, 1 mm EDTA at 4 °C (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 1.1-16.20Google Scholar). Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. When chick embryo hepatocytes were transfected with 5.8 kb of 5′-flanking DNA of the malic enzyme gene linked to the CAT gene (p[ME−5800/+31]CAT), CAT activity was increased more than 40-fold by T3 and inhibited by 96% by CPT-cAMP (Fig.1). CPT-cAMP did not have a statistically significant effect on luciferase activity in cells transfected with RSV-LUC. Thus, 5.8 kb of 5′-flanking DNA contains both positive acting T3REs, as previously reported (5Hodnett D.W. Fantozzi D.A. Thurmond D.C. Klautky S.A. MacPhee K.G. Estrem S.T. Xu G. Goodridge A.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and one or more inhibitory cAMP response elements (ICREs). The magnitude of the cAMP effect is similar to that for the inhibition of transcription of this gene caused by cAMP (4Salati L.M. Ma X.-J. McCormick C.C. Stapleton S.R. Goodridge A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4010-4016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that all of the elements necessary for the negative effect of cAMP may be located in this fragment of DNA. We next tested a series of 5′-deletions of p[ME−5800/+31]CAT to localize the ICRE(s) (Fig. 1). Deletion of the DNA from −5800 to −3845 bp caused an increase in responsiveness to cAMP. This deletion removes part of the T3 response region (5Hodnett D.W. Fantozzi D.A. Thurmond D.C. Klautky S.A. MacPhee K.G. Estrem S.T. Xu G. Goodridge A.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and may contain sequences that dampen the ability of cAMP to inhibit transcription. When the DNA from −3845 to −3474 bp was deleted, responsiveness to cAMP increased slightly, but the increase was not statistically significant. Deletion of the region from −3474 to −2715 bp decreased cAMP-mediated inhibition from 99 to 92%. This represents an 8-fold difference in sensitivity to cAMP between sets of cells transfected with these two plasmids. An additional decrease in responsiveness occurred when DNA from −2715 to −944 bp was removed (Fig. 1). Both p[ME−944/+31]CAT and p[ME−413/+31]CAT conferred statistically significant 64 and 45% inhibitions by cAMP, respectively. When cells were transfected with p[ME−147/+31]CAT, there was measurable basal activity but no inhibition by cAMP (results not shown). These results suggest that 3474 bp of 5′-flanking DNA contains three or more ICREs that are distinct from the major T3RE and several minor T3REs that are located between −3903 and −3703 bp (5Hodnett D.W. Fantozzi D.A. Thurmond D.C. Klautky S.A. MacPhee K.G. Estrem S.T. Xu G. Goodridge A.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). An expression vector containing the coding sequence for the catalytic subunit of PKA (pRSV-PKAc) (14Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6870-6873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was cotransfected with p[ME−5800/+31]CAT. Overexpression of catalytic subunit inhibited T3-induced CAT activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2 A). At 0.1 μg/plate, overexpression of the catalytic subunit inhibited T3-induced CAT activity by 80%. Even in cells treated with cAMP, overexpression of the catalytic subunit decreased CAT activity. These results suggest that the catalytic subunit of PKA itself is sufficient to inhibit promoter activity of the malic enzyme gene. The basal level of CAT activity (no T3) also was inhibited by cAMP, suggesting that inhibition by cAMP may be independent of T3. We also cotransfected a construct that expresses a specific inhibitor of the catalytic subunit (PKi or Walsh inhibitor) (25Grove J.R. Price D.J. Goodman H.M. Avruch J. Science. 1987; 238: 530-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). When 1 or 2 μg of pRSV-PKi was cotransfected with p[ME−5800/+31]CAT, inhibition by exogenously added cAMP was completely blocked; in fact, activity was higher than that in the absence of cAMP. In addition, overexpression of pRSV-PKi in the absence of cAMP, with or without T3, stimulated CAT activity. This suggests that these cells contain a significant level of free catalytic subunit of PKA in the absence of added cAMP. We conclude that the negative effect of cyclic AMP on transcription of the malic enzyme gene is mediated by the classical eukaryotic signaling pathway that involves PKA-mediated phosphorylation of target proteins. In the absence of T3, cyclic AMP caused 53 and 75% decreases in CAT activity in cells transfected by p[ME−5800/+31]CAT and p[ME−3474/+31]CAT, respectively (Fig.3). This result is consistent with the inhibition of promoter activity caused by overexpression of the free catalytic subunit of PKA and suggests that cAMP-mediated inhibition of transcription of the malic enzyme gene does not inhibit TR functionper se. The degree of inhibition by cAMP was much greater when promoter activity of the malic enzyme gene was induced by T3 than in the absence of T3 (Fig. 3); this may be due to greater sensitivity to cAMP in T3-treated cells. Alternatively, the lower cAMP responsiveness of the malic enzyme gene in cells that were not treated with T3 may be due to a combination of the lower level of promoter activity in the absence of T3 and a constitutive basal level of activity that is independent of T3 or cAMP. The conclusion that cAMP functions independently of T3 is supported by the results of a series of experiments in which different artificial and natural T3REs were linked to TKCAT and tested for responsiveness to T3 and cAMP. One construct contained five copies of a consensus T3RE (5′-AGGTCANNNAGGTCA-3′) linked to TKCAT (26Carlisle T.L. Roncero C. El Khadir-Mounier C. Thurmond D.C. Goodridge A.G. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2088-2097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); a second construct contained a palindromic T3RE linked to TKCAT (27Damm K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Nature. 1989; 339: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes transfected with each of these constructs gave robust responses to T3 but did not respond to cAMP (results not shown). Similarly, cells transfected with T3RE2 of the malic enzyme gene linked directly to TKCAT also failed to respond to cAMP (Fig.4). Thus, a T3 response by itself is not sufficient to make transcription of the malic enzyme gene responsive to cAMP. Plasmid [ME−5800/+31]CAT and an expression vector for chicken TRα were cotransfected into hepatocytes. At many T3REs, TR is a repressor in the absence of T3 (15Samuels H.H. Forman B.M. Horowitz Z.D. Ye Z.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Overexpression of TRα caused the expected decrease in basal activity (IC-treated cells) and an increase in T3-induced activity (Fig. 5); inhibition by cAMP decreased from ∼95 to ∼40%. Three regions appear to contain ICREs (Fig. 1). DNA fragments containing the putative ICREs were subcloned upstream of the TK promoter in pTKCAT. A 35-bp oligonucleotide containing T3RE2 of the malic enzyme gene (5Hodnett D.W. Fantozzi D.A. Thurmond D.C. Klautky S.A. MacPhee K.G. Estrem S.T. Xu G. Goodridge A.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was inserted upstream of each of the ICRE-containing fragments that lacked a T3RE. This ensured a high level of promoter activity in T3-treated cells (Fig. 4). When hepatocytes were transfected with the p[ME−3474/−2715]TKCAT, cAMP inhibited T3-induced CAT activity by 98% (Fig. 4 A). In cells transfected with p[ME(T3RE2)−1713/−944]TKCAT and p[ME(T3RE2)−413/−147]TKCAT, cAMP caused 77 and 72% inhibition of CAT activity, respectively (Fig.4 B). Cyclic AMP had no effect on promoter activity in control cells transfected with p[ME-T3RE2]TKCAT or pTKCAT. These results and those in Fig. 1 are consistent with there being at least three ICREs in the 5′-flanking DNA of the malic enzyme gene. For further localization of the 5′-most ICRE(s), we constructed and tested a series of deletions of p[ME−3474/−2715]TKCAT (Fig.4 A). Deletion of the 5′-end to −3260 bp or the 3′-end to −2929 bp did not affect either T3 or cAMP responsiveness of hepatocytes transfected with these constructs. When the DNA from −3259 to −3115 bp was deleted from the parent plasmid, T3 responsiveness was essentially unchanged, but inhibition by cAMP decreased from 98 to 22%, indicating that an ICRE was located in this DNA fragment. When the DNA from −3114 to −2930 bp was deleted, T3 responsiveness decreased to 2-fold, and inhibition by cAMP decreased to 23%. This result suggests that a T3RE is located in this region. The decrease in responsiveness to cAMP could have been due to 1) the presence of a second ICRE in this region, 2) an ICRE that overlaps both of these deletions, or 3) the deletion of the T3RE localized between −3114 and −2930 bp. T3-induced activity in the absence of a T3RE is little different from basal activity and may be too low to permit detection of a larger response to cAMP. Each of the fragments containing a potential ICRE was subcloned upstream of the TK promoter in pTKCAT and transfected into hepatocytes (Fig. 6). The major T3RE of the malic enzyme gene was inserted upstream of the −3259-/−3115-bp fragment. This was not necessary for the −3114-/−2930-bp fragment, because it contains a T3RE. In cells transfected with p[ME(T3RE2)−3259/−3115]TKCAT, CAT activity was strongly suppressed by cAMP (98%). In contrast, when the cells were transfected with p[ME−3114/−2930]TKCAT, there was no change in CAT activity in response to cAMP despite the fact that CAT activity was stimulated 12-fold by T3. These results indicate that at least one ICRE is localized between −3259 and −3115 bp in the 5′-flanking DNA of the gene for malic enzyme. They also confirm the presence of a T3RE between −3114 and −2930 bp and support the suggestion that the loss of cAMP responsiveness that occurred when this fragment was deleted from a plasmid containing the −3474 to −2715 bp fragment was due to loss of this T3RE. To localize the ICRE more precisely, we prepared a series of deletions of p[ME(T3RE2)−3259/−3115]TKCAT (Fig.7). Deletion from −3259 to −3192 bp had no effect on responsiveness to cAMP. Deletion from −3192 to −3161 bp decreased inhibition by cAMP from more than 98 to 76%, a 15-fold change in responsiveness to cAMP. Further deletion to −3134 bp had no effect. These results suggest that there are at least two ICREs in this fragment, one between −3192 and −3161 bp and one between −3134 and −3115 bp. We next focused on the ICRE between −3192 and −3161 bp. This 34-bp fragment contains a sequence that is very similar (one mismatch) to those of AP1 sites that are required for cAMP-mediated inhibition of transcription the IL-2 and IL-2R genes (11Tamir A. Isakov N. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3391-3399PubMed Google Scholar). p[ME(T3RE2)−3192/−3158]TKCAT was constructed in a wild-type form or with a block mutation in the putative AP1 site (complementary sequence) (Fig. 8). In cells transfected with the wild-type construct, CAT activ"
https://openalex.org/W2093702879,"Mα2-3 is a monoclonal antibody that partially mimics the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Its three-dimensional structure has been previously predicted by molecular modeling, suggesting that 29 complementarity determining region (CDR) residues and 2 framework residues are exposed to solvent. To identify the antibody residues that bind to the antigen, i.e. snake toxin that binds specifically to AChR, we (i) produced the scFv form of Mα2-3 fused to alkaline phosphatase, in the periplasmic space ofEscherichia coli; (ii) submitted approximately 75% of exposed residues of the fused scFv to individual or combined mutations, and (iii) identified the residues whose mutations affect scFv binding to the toxin, using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 11 critical residues were identified, including 8 heavy chain residues, 2 framework residues, and 1 light chain residue. They cover a surface of approximately 800 Å2, with a subset of most critical residues (VHD31, VHY32, and VHG101) and several aromatic residues. This functional architecture not only constitutes a plausible complementary binding surface for the snake toxin but also offers a structural basis to ultimately understand the capacity of the antibody to partially mimic AChR.

This functional architecture not only constitutes a plausible complementary binding surface for the snake toxin but also offers a structural basis to ultimately understand the capacity of the antibody to partially mimic AChR. Understanding of the molecular events that are associated with activation and inactivation of channels by specific ligands requires an elucidation of the complementary interacting sites (1Changeux J.P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 485-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 2Stampe P. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In this respect, crystallographic analyses of ion channel-ligand complexes would be most informative; however, due to their membranous character, ion channels are not readily amenable to crystallization. Therefore, alternative approaches are required to investigate the sites by which a ligand and an ion channel interact. One of them, which has not been much considered as yet, consists of exploiting the capacity of some antibody to mimic, at least to some extent, a receptor or an ion channel. Previous studies have revealed that some monoclonal antibodies raised against receptor-specific ligands share structural and/or functional properties with receptors (3Davis S.J. Schockmel G.A.

Evidently, such receptor-mimicking antibodies constitute interesting templates to approach the structure of a ligand binding site on its receptor. The goal of this study was, therefore, to elucidate the functional architecture of the paratope of Mα2-3, an antibody that shares a number of properties with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) 1The abbreviations used are: AChR, acetylcholine receptor; CDR, complementarity determining region; FR, framework region; Lk, linker-coding sequence; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RIA, radioimmunoassay; EIA, enzyme immunoassay; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PhoA, alkaline phosphatase. 1The abbreviations used are: AChR, acetylcholine receptor; CDR, complementarity determining region; FR, framework region; Lk, linker-coding sequence; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RIA, radioimmunoassay; EIA, enzyme immunoassay; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PhoA, alkaline phosphatase., a ligand-gated ion channel (6Ducancel F.

Padlan E.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 439-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 8Padlan E.A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, despite our extensive efforts, no crystal of Mα2-3 alone or complexed to its antigen has ever been obtained. Therefore, to identify the functional structure of the antibody, we decided to combine modeling studies and mutational analyses. In this strategy, two steps are required. First, a predictive model of the antibody has to be established. Using the amino acid sequence of Mα2-3 deduced from its cloned cDNA, four predictive models of its combining antigen site including CDRs were previously selected (9Tenette C. Ducancel F. Smith J.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1996; 26: 9-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). All models suggested that the putative combining site of Mα2-3 possesses 31 solvent exposed residues that presumably include most functional elements of the antibody combining site. The second step is the major objective of this study. It corresponds to an experimental identification of the functional residues of Mα2-3.The goal of this paper is 4-fold. First, using a convenient bacterial expression system, we produced, in the periplasmic space ofEscherichia coli, a functionally active scFv fragment of Mα2-3 inserted in the N-terminal region of the reporter bacterial alkaline phosphatase, as described previously for various antigens or antibodies (10Gillet D.

Boulain J.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 181: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Second, we developed a sensitive ELISA that allowed us to determine the binding affinity of Mα2-3·toxin complex. Third, we introduced 43 individual mutations within the combining site of the chimeric form of scFvMα2-3, and using the ELISA, we identified the residues whose mutations affect the stability of the antibody-toxin complex. Fourth, we examined the compatibility of the proposed structural models of the antibody (9Tenette C. Ducancel F. Smith J.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1996; 26: 9-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) with the results of our mutational analysis and analyzed the architecture of the identified functional paratope in the frame of its capacity to mimic some properties of AChR.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONProduction and Characterization of Recombinant scFvMα2-3-PhoA HybridOur laboratory has previously developed a system to produce recombinant colorimetric proteins in E. coli. They are bi-functional hybrids with a single chain protein that is introduced between residues +6 and +7 of the mature form of PhoA. Monomeric proteins that have been successfully associated to PhoA include a snake toxin (10Gillet D. Ducancel F. Pradel E. Léonetti M. Ménez A. Boulain J.C. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), rat prolactin (19Gillet D. Ezan E. Ducancel F. Gaillard C. Ardouin T. Istin M. Ménez A. Boulain J.C. Grognet J.M. Anal . Chem. 1993; 65: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), human proinsulin (20Chanussot C. Bellanger L. Ligny-Lemaire C. Seguin P. Ménez A. Boulain J.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 197: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and an scFv derived from an anti-human IgG antibody (12Carrier A. Ducancel F. Settiawan N.B. Cattolico L. Maillère B. Léonetti M. Drevet P. Ménez A. Boulain J.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 181: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Another scFv was also successfully fused to PhoA by others, using a similar approach (21Wels W. Harwerth I-M. Zwickl M. Hardman N. Groner B. Hynes E. Bio/Technology. 1992; 10: 1128-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Using an appropriate dicistronic vector, the hybrid can also accommodate the presence of the more complex structure of a Fab per PhoA subunit (11Ducancel F. Gillet D. Carrier A. Lajeunesse E. Ménez A. Boulain J.C. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In all cases, the gene encoding the signal peptide of PhoA precedes the gene encoding the mature amino acid sequence of PhoA. Clearly, the presence of both the signal peptide and the first six amino acids of PhoA favors exportation of hybrids into the periplasm of E. coli, where their cysteines are oxidized into disulfide bonds and their native-like structure is formed (10Gillet D. Ducancel F. Pradel E. Léonetti M. Ménez A. Boulain J.C. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Ducancel F. Gillet D. Carrier A. Lajeunesse E. Ménez A.

FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and its mutants were produced as colorimetric scFv fragments. In practice, the DNA encoding the Mα2-3 VL fragment was linked to the gene encoding its VH fragment by a DNA encoding a peptide of 14 amino acids (GGSTSGKSSEGKGG). The whole gene was inserted into the expression vector pLIP5 under the transcriptional control of the tacpromoter (12Carrier A. Ducancel F. Settiawan N.B. Cattolico L. Maillère B. Léonetti M. Drevet P. Ménez A. Boulain J.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 181: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 23Amann E. Brosius J. Ptashne M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1983; 25: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). W3110 bacterial cells were transformed by the vector and cultured. The periplasmic extracts were then submitted to an SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were revealed by an immunoblotting, using an anti-PhoA antibody. As shown on Fig.1 A, lane WT scFv-PhoA, a major band migrates with the expected molecular mass of the scFvMα2-3-PhoA monomeric form (75 kDa). Two faint bands having approximately the size of free PhoA (approximately 50 kDa) can also be observed.As deduced from the use of a sensitive and accurate radioimmunoassay (18Boulain J.C. Ménez A. Couderc J. Faure G. Liacopoulos P. Fromageot P. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2910-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the wild-type hybrid present in the bacteria periplasm binds in a specific and saturable manner to 3H-labeled toxin α, the antigen of Mα2-3 (Fig. 2). A Scatchard analysis derived from these data indicated that the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of the complex is 35 nm, a value that is only 3-fold higher than that obtained with both the parent monoclonal antibody (22Trémeau O. Boulain J-C. Couderc J. Fromageot P. Ménez A. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and the recombinant F(ab)2-PhoA hybrid (11Ducancel F. Gillet D. Carrier A. Lajeunesse E. Ménez A. Boulain J.C. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Such a difference is not uncommon since a number of Fv and scFv display affinities lowered by 2–10-fold as compared with parent antibodies (24Darveau R.P. Somerville J.E. Fell H.P. J. Clin. Immunol. 1992; 15: 25-29Google Scholar). Possibly, the presence of both the constant domains CH1 and CL and the inter-chain disulfides in parent antibodies stabilizes the VH-VL interface (25Glockshuber R. Malia M. Pfitzinger I. Plückthun A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1362-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar).Figure 2Binding of 3H-toxin α to scFv Mα2-3-PhoA from crude periplasmic extract with various amounts of tritiated toxin α (12 Ci/mmol). The insert represents a Scatchard plot of the data. The deduced apparentK d is 35 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Incubation of crude periplasmic extracts on microtitration plates coated with toxin α revealed the presence of PhoA activity. The corresponding colorimetric signal decreased in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of increasing amounts of toxin α, with an IC50 of 2.10−8m (Fig. 3). Therefore, the periplasmic extract contains a bifunctional component that both recognizes specifically the coated toxin and generates a colorimetric signal. Since the bacterial PhoA is active as a homodimer (26Coleman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 441-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), we anticipate that this component is the hybrid (scFvMα2-3)2-PhoA. In agreement with this view, we obtained the same result with the (FabMα2-3)2-PhoA conjugate, which was previously characterized (11Ducancel F. Gillet D. Carrier A. Lajeunesse E. Ménez A. Boulain J.C. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). We have not quantitatively determined the activity of the PhoA moiety; however, since our previous constructions displayed high colorimetric activity (11Ducancel F. Gillet D. Carrier A. Lajeunesse E. Ménez A. Boulain J.C. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 12Carrier A. Ducancel F. Settiawan N.B. Cattolico L. Maillère B. Léonetti M. Drevet P. Ménez A. Boulain J.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 181: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we suspect that it is the same here. Therefore, our data strongly suggest that the periplasmic space of the bacteria contained the expected scFv form of Mα2-3. We also noted that neither inversion of the order of the variable domains (VH was followed by the 14-amino acids linker and VL) nor an increase of the length of the linker peptide from 14 to 18 residues (GSTSGSGKPGSGEGSTKG), 2K. Mérienne, N. Germain, S. Zinn-Justin, J-C. Boulain, F. Ducancel, and A. Ménez, unpublished data. as suggested in other instances (27Whitlow M. Filpula D. Rollence M.L. Feng S-L. Wood J.F. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), modified the specificity and affinity of the recombinant hybrid (data not shown). Therefore, the N terminus residues from VL or VH domains of Mα2-3 as well as the linker length play little role in the functional site of the antibody, in agreement with previous data obtained with other scFvs.Figure 3Inhibition of scFv Mα2-3-PhoA and Fab Mα2-3-PhoA binding to coated toxin α by increasing amounts of soluble toxin. The IC50 calculated from competition curves give in both cases a value of 2.10−8m.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)On the ELISAs Made With scFvMα2-3-PhoA HybridsThe covalent association of PhoA activity with scFvMα2-3 offers a convenient means to rapidly detect a specific binding of the hybrid to a coated antigen, using a conventional ELISA. However, in such an assay, it is often unclear as to whether the colorimetric assay indeed reflects the actual affinity of the antigen for the antibody. To shed light on this issue, we compared binding data resulting from both ELISA and a sensitive RIA made with a soluble antigen (18Boulain J.C. Ménez A. Couderc J. Faure G. Liacopoulos P. Fromageot P. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2910-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We used four (scFvMα2-3)2-PhoA mutants having a wide range of different affinities. The first two mutants were substituted in the CDR1L. For one of them, Asn-31 was changed into Ala and for the other an additional Ser was inserted between Ser-30 and Asn-31. These mutants were named, respectively, VLN31A and VLS30+S. The other two mutants were substituted in the CDR3L. One of them had an additional proline after position Ser-94 and was named VLS94+P. The original sequence (VLYSS(92–94)) of the other mutant was changed into VLHRF(92–94)+P. The four mutants were produced and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot experiments. Fig. 1 B shows that their electrophoretic profiles were similar to that of the wild-type hybrid, the similarity of band intensities suggesting equivalent levels of production in all cases. Tritiated toxin α bound specifically to each mutant and in a saturable manner, as indicated by an RIA performed in solution (18Boulain J.C. Ménez A. Couderc J. Faure G. Liacopoulos P. Fromageot P. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2910-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Two typical binding curves and their derived Scatchard plots are shown in Fig. 4. The affinities of the four mutants had K d values ranging from 28 nm to 500 nm (Fig.5 A). In parallel experiments, we monitored the colorimetric signal at 410 nm of the same mutants, using an ELISA made with coated toxin. A simple glance at Fig.5 A is sufficient to reveal that the signal intensities determined by ELISA nicely parallel the K d values deduced from RIA. The mutant VLHRF(92–94)+P has a slightly higher affinity, as compared with the wild-type antibody, whereas VL(S30+S) has the weakest affinity in both cases. Fig. 5 B illustrates the linear relationship between the colorimetric intensities andK d values. Therefore, the ELISA allowed us to estimate K d values using small amounts of hybrids and without the use of a radioactive tracer.Figure 4Binding of 3H-toxin α to two mutant scFv Mα2-3-PhoA from crude periplasmic extract with various amounts of tritiated toxin α (12 Ci/mmol).

Ducancel F. Smith J.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1996; 26: 9-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Thus, 31 residues of a putative combining site were proposed to be exposed to solvent. As indicated by various x-ray diffraction studies of antibody-antigen complexes (28Prasad L. Sharma S. Vandonselaar M. Quail J.W. Lee J.S. Waygood E.B. Wilson K.S. Dauter Z. Delbaere L.T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10705-10708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Dall' Acqua W. Goldman E.R. Eisenstein E. Mariuzza R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9667-9676Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), these exposed residues should include most functional residues, and therefore, they were investigated in priority. The amino acids predicted to be surface exposed are indicated in Fig. 6. Mutations at these positions are anticipated to not dramatically alter the structure of the antibody fragment, and as a result, a subsequent variation in binding affinity is likely to reflect the functionality of mutated residues. Some studies even suggested that an affinity change greater than 10-fold might indicate that the mutated residue is energetically important for the stabilization of the antibody-antigen complex (28Prasad L. Sharma S. Vandonselaar M. Quail J.W. Lee J.S. Waygood E.B. Wilson K.S. Dauter Z. Delbaere L.T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10705-10708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, and although one must keep in mind that this value may vary from one complex to another, we have considered, at least in the first step of our analysis, that a mutated residue is functional when a mutation causes at least such an affinity change.Figure 6A, space-filling representation of the Mα2-3 combining site showing the amino acids that are predicted to be exposed to solvent. The following color code is used. Incyan, blue, and violet are indicated the CDRs 1H, 2H, and 3H, respectively; in yellow,orange, and red are indicated the CDRs 1L, 2L, and 3L, respectively; and in green are shown the 2 tyrosine residues 49 and 67 that belong to the framework region of the light chain.

(1996).B, amino acid sequences of the CDRs of Mα2-3. CDRs areunderlined. The flanking amino acids belong to the framework regions.

Ducancel F. Smith J.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1996; 26: 9-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), 15 and 14, respectively, belong to the light and heavy chains. 19 of them were individually probed by site-directed mutagenesis. These are D31, Y32, Y33, Y52, A54, S55, N57, M100, G101, A102, T103, and A104 in the heavy chain and N31, Y50, S52, S53, R54, Y55, and Y92 in the light chain. Though belonging to the framework, the exposed residues VLY49 and VLY67 were also probed because the corresponding residues of other antibodies were previously reported to be functionally important (7Davies D.R. Padlan E.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 439-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) and also because VLY49 and VLY67 belong to the curious “tyrosine-ring,” which was suspected to include functionally important residues (9Tenette C. Ducancel F. Smith J.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1996; 26: 9-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Several different substitutions were introduced at various positions. For example, to clarify the role of the numerous tyrosines that surround the CDR3H, 7 of them were mutated into both Ser and Phe. Also, the role of CDR3H and CDR3L was investigated by multiple and random mutagenesis. Finally, the length of CDR1L and CDR3L were respectively modified by inserting one additional Ser or Pro residue. As a whole, 43 mutants were constructed to probe, individually or in combination, the role of 23 of 31 solvent exposed positions (29 from CDRs and 2 from framework).Functional Mapping of the Paratope of Mα2-3All mutants were produced as (scFvMα2-3)2-PhoA hybrids, and the correctness of their amino acid sequence was inferred from analysis of their nucleotide sequence. For all mutants, the level of production was approximately comparable with that of the wild-type (scFvMα2-3)2-PhoA hybrid. The effect of mutations on stability of antibody-toxin complexes was investigated by ELISA, and the K d values were then derived from the linear relationship shown in Fig. 5 B. The results are compiled in Figs. 7 and8.Figure 7Ability of the mutants scFv-PhoA to bind to toxin α, as determined from direct ELISA assays. Mutations occur in the heavy chain CDRs 1H, 2H, and 3H, in the light chain CDRs 1L, 2L, and 3L, and in framework regions of the light chain (FRs 2L and 3L).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 8Effects of mutations on ELISA signals andK d values.

Our data obtained with scFvMα2-3 agree with this view since simultaneous mutations of the 5 residues MGATA (100–104) into RAQLR or of the four residues MGAT (100–103) into STTY completely abolished the capacity of the antibody to bind to the toxin. Therefore, 1 or more residues of the MGAT sequence may be functionally important. Accordingly, Figs. 7 and 8show that individual mutations at M100, G101, A102, or T103 caused substantial affinity decreases, some of them being quite large. Since each of these four residues is functionally important, it is not surprising that their concomitant mutations destroyed the binding capacity of the antibody. Mutation of the adjacent A104 into serine had virtually no effect on the complex stability. Therefore, though more mutants may be needed, we suspect that A104 plays a weak, if any, functional role. One may note that the mutation A102G caused little affinity change, whereas mutation A102S and especially A102V caused much larger effects. This type of situation is not uncommon. In effect, although a residue may establish clear contacts with residues of the binding partner, it may be more sensitive to som"

For truncated SHP-1 at pH 5.0, the reaction proceeded through an initial burst phase followed by a slower secondary phase. Our experiments demonstrated that the burst phase corresponded to the reaction of the aromatic disulfide with the active site cysteine. The magnitude of the burst phase was found to measure the active enzyme concentration, and the rate of the burst reflected the reactivity of the active site cysteine. The data were consistent with a mechanism in which an intramolecular disulfide is formed between the active site cysteine and a proximal cysteine during the burst reaction. Aromatic disulfides were found to react with the active site cysteines of full-length SHP-1 and truncated PTP1B also. Using vanadate to mask the active site cysteine, the active enzyme concentration could be assayed by comparing product yields for the reaction with aromatic disulfides in the presence and absence of vanadate at pH 8.0. These findings demonstrate the utility of aromatic disulfides as active site titrants and reactivity probes for tyrosine phosphatases.

PTPases may be grouped into two classes: receptor-like, transmembrane enzymes having an extracellular domain, a transmembrane region, and one or two intracellular phosphatase domains; and soluble, non-transmembrane enzymes with a single catalytic domain. PTP1B was the first tyrosine phosphatase to be identified and belongs to non-transmembrane family of PTPases (9Tonks N.K. Diltz C.D. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6722-6730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A subgroup of this family contains two src homology 2 (SH2) domains in addition to a catalytic domain. SH2 domains allow for protein-protein interactions based on tyrosine phosphorylation, and in proteins with catalytic activity SH2 domains can have regulatory roles (6Pregel M.J. Shen S.-H. Storer A.C. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1309-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 8Pei D. Neel B.J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

SHP-1 (also known as PTP1C, SH-PTP1, HCP, and SHP) is a tyrosine phosphatase containing two SH2 domains that regulate the catalytic domain (6Pregel M.J. Shen S.-H. Storer A.C.

We studied the reaction of full-length and truncated forms of the SHP-1 phosphatase as well as a truncated form of PTP1B with two aromatic disulfides: 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, Ellman's reagent) and 2,2′-dipyridyl disulfide (2-PDS). The truncated form of SHP-1 lacked the regulatory NH2-terminal SH2 domain (SHP1ΔNSH2), whereas the truncated form of PTP1B lacked the COOH-terminal domain responsible for membrane localization (PTP1BΔCterm). Aromatic disulfides (ArSSAr) react selectively with the conjugate base of a thiol (RS−) giving a mixed disulfide (RSSAr) and an aromatic thiolate (ArS−) whose release may be followed by UV-visible spectrophotometry. The rate of reaction varies with the pH and pK a of the thiol (15Singh R. Whitesides G.M. Patai S. Rappoport Z. Supplement S: The Chemistry of Sulphur-containing Functional Groups. John Wiley and Sons, New York1993: 633-658Google Scholar). Under acidic conditions, cysteines having “normal” pK a values of 8–9.5 react slowly because only a very small proportion are in the reactive thiolate form. In contrast, because of its low pK a value the essential cysteine residue at the phosphatase active site is ionized to a significant extent at low pH and would be predicted to react rapidly with aromatic disulfides. Thus, we expected that the active site and non-active site cysteine residues of tyrosine phosphatases might be distinguished on the basis of their differential reactivities with aromatic disulfides at low pH. Spectrophotometric observation of the reaction of aromatic disulfides with the essential cysteine in the phosphatase active site would permit easy measurement of active enzyme concentration, giving information important in kinetic studies. In cases where enzyme activity is lost with time, an active site titration is necessary to determine accurately the active enzyme concentration that is necessary to calculate k cat. Direct observation of the reaction between aromatic disulfides and the essential cysteine would also allow these reagents to be used to assess the reactivity of the active site cysteine by measurement of the reaction rate, making them useful tools in kinetic and mechanistic studies of tyrosine phosphatases. All chemicals were reagent grade and were used without further purification. Full-length SHP-1, SHP1ΔNSH2 (amino acids 107–597), was expressed and purified as described elsewhere (6Pregel M.J. Shen S.-H. Storer A.C. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1309-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). PTP1BΔCterm (amino acids 1–321) was obtained from Dr. C. Ramachandran (Merck-Frosst Center for Therapeutic Research, Montreal) (16Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The buffers used were as follows: pH 4.5 and 5.0: 0.5 m NaOAc/HCl, 1 mm EDTA; pH 5.5: 0.5m succinic acid/NaOH, 1 mm EDTA; pH 6.0: 0.5m 3,3-dimethylglutaric acid/NaOH, 1 mm EDTA; pH 7.0: 0.2 m bisTrispropane/HCl, 1 mm EDTA; pH 8.0: 0.2 m Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA. The DTNB stock solution (10 mm) was prepared by dissolving solid DTNB in pH 5 buffer; 2-PDS stock solution (1 mm) was prepared by adding an aliquot of 2-PDS in methanol (0.1 m) to rapidly stirred pH 5 buffer. With 1 ml of buffer in the reference cuvette and x ml of enzyme solution and (1 − x) ml of buffer in the sample cuvette, the spectrophotometer (Cary 3B) was zeroed at 410 nm (DTNB) or 342 nm (2-PDS). Aliquots of DTNB or 2-PDS stock solution were added to reference and sample; both cuvettes were well mixed. Data collection was started upon addition of aromatic disulfide to the sample cuvette. For experiments with phenylarsine oxide (PAO), PAO was added to the enzyme stock solution several minutes before reaction with DTNB. For experiments with sodium orthovanadate, pH 5.0 buffer without EDTA containing about 2 mm vanadate was prepared. The differences in the extinction coefficients between DTNB and the TNB product are: Δε410 = 11,860m−1 cm−1 at pH 5.0 and 13,860m−1 cm−1 at pH 8.0. When replicate burst measurements were fitted to Equation 1 (see below), the magnitude of the burst was reproducible to within 10% (1ς), and the burst rate was reproducible to within 5% (1ς). During the reaction of the PTPases with aromatic disulfides at pH 5.0, activity was assayed using 10 mm pNPP in 50 mmNaOAc/HCl pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, I = 0.15m (NaCl), at 22 °C by following absorbance changes at 400 nm. Protein concentrations were measured by UV absorption using calculated extinction coefficients based on the numbers of Tyr and Trp residues in the proteins together with average extinction coefficients for these residues (17Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). A series of samples was prepared containing enzyme (about 4.0 μm), pH 5.0 buffer, and DTNB (0–10 μm) in septum-sealed vials. The vials were well mixed, flushed with nitrogen gas, and stored in the dark. Residual activity was assayed periodically against pNPP as described above; aliquots (20 μl) from the reaction vials were added to 1 ml of phosphatase assay buffer. For each sample, activity was plotted as a function of time, and the plateau region where activity loss was slow was extrapolated back to zero time to estimate residual activity at the end of the burst reaction with DTNB. Activities were normalized with respect to the activity of a control sample without DTNB at zero time. Reaction mixtures containing enzyme and DTNB were applied to a Sephadex G-15 column (bed volume at least 10 times greater than sample volume) equilibrated with 50 mm NaOAc/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 5.0 buffer and eluted at 0.5–1.0 ml/min, and fractions were collected based on absorption at 280 nm. To isolate products after the burst phase, a trial run was performed in a spectrophotometer to determine the absorbance at which the burst phase was over by fitting absorbance versus time data to Equation 1 (see below). The absorbance of the slowly reacting sample was monitored and applied to the column when this absorbance was reached. The atomic coordinates of the crystal structure of PTP1B (18Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) were provided by Dr. D. Barford (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY) and displayed using Insight (BioSym Inc.). To identify non-active site cysteine residues close to the active site cysteine of SHP-1, cysteine residues in the sequence of the SHP-1 catalytic domain were placed at the corresponding positions (based on sequence alignment) in the PTP1B structure. Residues 87, 141, and 242 were changed to Cys; residues 121 (conserved) and 215 (essential, active site nucleophile) are cysteines in the PTP1B sequence which correspond to cysteines in the SHP-1 sequence. Cα–Cα distances between the active site and non-active site cysteines were measured using BioSym. The reaction of DTNB with thiols liberates 2-thio-5-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB) (10Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar, 19Jocelyn P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 44-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Fig.1 A shows a trace of the concentration of TNB released as a function of time for the reaction of SHP1ΔNSH2 with excess DTNB at pH 5.0. The TNB release is biphasic, with a rapid initial phase followed by a slower secondary phase. The reaction of SHP1ΔNSH2 with 2-PDS releasing 2-pyridinethione displayed similar behavior (data not shown). Reaction of enzyme with aromatic disulfide gave inactive enzyme, but activity was regained upon treatment with dithiothreitol. To measure the size and rate of the burst, absorbance versustime data, e.g. the 0–5 min portion of the pH 5.0 trace in Fig. 1 A, were fitted to an equation having an exponential term (to describe the burst phase) and a linear term (to describe the initial part of the secondary phase) (Equation 1). Both phases were assumed to be pseudo-first-order processes since DTNB was in large excess over enzyme. Data were collected so as to include the entire burst phase but only the initial part of the secondary phase, allowing the secondary phase to be approximated by a linear term. The adjustable parameters were b, the size of the burst;kb, the rate constant for the burst phase; and ks, the initial slope of the secondary phase. A(t)=b(1−exp(−kb*t))+kstEquation 1 In the presence of excess DTNB, there was a linear relationship between the size of the burst at pH 5.0 and the concentration of added enzyme. When different enzyme samples were used, a linear relationship between burst size and enzyme activity was found (data not shown), suggesting that DTNB reacted at the active site. At a fixed enzyme concentration, the size of the burst remained constant, whereas the rate of the burst phase increased linearly with DTNB concentration up to a DTNB concentration of about 0.25 mm (data not shown). When the magnitudes of the bursts in the TNB and 2-PDS reactions at pH 5.0 were compared, the difference (<5%) was smaller than the experimental error. In the burst phase at pH 5.0, the reaction of enzyme with DTNB was found to be competitive with both a substrate and a product of the phosphatase reaction. The burst rate was reduced about 5-fold in the presence of 0.37 m sodium phosphate, a product and competitive inhibitor of the PTPase reaction, whereas the magnitude of the burst remained essentially unchanged (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, phosphotyrosine, a PTPase substrate, slowed the reaction in a concentration-dependent manner but also caused the enzyme to precipitate (data not shown). When the enzyme was denatured with 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate before reaction with DTNB, no burst was seen, only a slow reaction with a rate similar to that of the secondary phase in the reaction of untreated enzyme (Fig. 1 B). Of the amino acid residues in proteins, aromatic disulfides react exclusively with cysteines. Because the burst reaction of DTNB with the PTPase is competitive with both a substrate and a substrate-competitive inhibitor of the phosphatase reaction, we concluded that the burst reaction must involve a cysteine residue at the active site. The kinetic behavior for the reaction of SHP1ΔNSH2 with a large excess of DTNB at pH 5.0 is compared with the behavior at pH 8.0 in Fig. 1 A. At pH 5.0, release of TNB was biphasic, whereas at pH 8.0, the release appeared to be monophasic. When allowed to proceed to completion, reactions at both pH values gave the same total amount of TNB release, whereas the extent of reaction at pH 8.0 was 3.4-fold larger than the burst at pH 5.0. The reaction of SHP1ΔNSH2 with 2-PDS displayed similar behavior (data not shown). SHP1ΔNSH2 has a total of six cysteine residues in its sequence. The process at pH 8.0 was assumed to reflect reaction of all free cysteines in the protein. If all six react with DTNB, this suggests that two cysteines may be involved in the burst reaction at pH 5.0. Experiments were also performed at various other pH values between 4.5 and 8.0, and the traces of absorbance versus time were fitted to Equation 1. The pH dependences of the burst rate (kb) in reactions with DTNB and 2-PDS are shown in Fig. 2. Both pH profiles show high reactivity at pH 8.0 as well as maxima at pH 5.0. At pH ≤ 6 the rate represents the burst phase only, whereas at pH > 6 the primary and secondary phases of the reaction could not be separated, and the fitted rate constant was a composite of the rates of the primary and secondary phases. These profiles are reminiscent of the reactivity of the active site cysteine of papain toward 2-PDS under acidic conditions, which gives a bell-shaped pH profile centered at pH 3.75 (20Brocklehurst K. Willenbrock F. Salih E. Neuberger A. Brocklehurst K. Hydrolytic Enzymes. Elsevier, Amsterdam1987: 39-158Google Scholar), as well as the pH profile for the reaction of DTNB with iodoacetamide-treated cytosolic phospholipase A2, which showed a maximum at pH 6.5 as well as high reactivity at pH 9.5 (21Li B. Copp L. Castelhano A.L. Feng R. Stahl M. Yuan Z. Krantz A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8594-8603Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The pH profile of k cat/K m for the reaction of SHP1ΔNSH2 with pNPP substrate also has a maximum at low pH (pH 5.5) (Fig. 2) (6Pregel M.J. Shen S.-H. Storer A.C. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1309-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although the conditions under which the pH profiles were measured were not identical, the similarity of the profiles strongly suggests that the burst in the DTNB and 2-PDS reactions at low pH, like the reaction with substrate, involved the essential active site cysteine residue. (The ionic strength was 0.15m throughout the pNPP pH profile; higher ionic strength conditions were used for the DTNB and 2-PDS pH profiles, and the ionic strength was not constant across the profiles (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”).) To test whether DTNB reacts at the active site, we monitored TNB release and enzyme activity simultaneously during a slow reaction between SHP1ΔNSH2 and DTNB at pH 5.0 (Fig.3). As TNB was released, enzyme activity decreased in a mirror-image fashion. The inset of Fig. 3 is a Tsou plot of the residual activity versus the number of equivalents of TNB released (relative to the size of the burst in reaction of enzyme with a large excess of DTNB at pH 5.0, measured in a separate experiment) (22Tsou C.-L. Sci. Sin. 1962; 11: 1535-1558PubMed Google Scholar). The inset shows that activity loss is directly proportional to TNB release and that the enzyme was inactivated completely upon release of 0.95 eq of TNB, i.e.at the end of the burst phase. Control experiments showed that activity loss under the conditions of this experiment but in the absence of DTNB was ≤ 5% over 2 h. The relationship between the release of 2-pyridinethione and loss of activity in the reaction of 2-PDS with SHP1ΔNSH2 at pH 5.0 was also investigated, and similar behavior was observed (data not shown). These results show that the initial reaction between the PTPase and DTNB or 2-PDS is stoichiometric and results in enzyme that is completely inactive. Thus, the burst reaction at pH 5.0 must involve either the active site cysteine or another cysteine whose reaction completely blocks the active site. From the similarity between the pH profiles of the DTNB reaction and the substrate reaction, the former possibility appears most likely. Site-directed mutagenesis to prepare enzyme in which the active site cysteine was replaced by serine to test this hypothesis directly failed to yield sufficient quantities of protein for reaction with aromatic disulfides. To learn more about DTNB inactivation of the phosphatase, we titrated PTPase activity against DTNB to determine the minimum concentration of DTNB required to cause complete inactivation. A series of samples at pH 5.0 having identical enzyme concentrations but increasing DTNB concentrations was prepared. The decrease in enzyme activity for each sample was monitored as a function of time, and the plateau region where the activity decrease was very slow was extrapolated back to zero time, thus giving a measurement of the residual activity at the end of the burst phase. Residual activity was normalized with respect to the activity of control sample without added DTNB at zero time and then plotted against the initial DTNB concentration (Fig. 4). The zero activity intercept in the plot of residual activity against DTNB concentration was calculated, giving the minimal concentration of DTNB required to inactivate the enzyme sample. The size of the burst of TNB released in reaction of the same enzyme sample with a large excess of DTNB at pH 5.0 was measured in a separate experiment. The burst of TNB release (7.9 μm) was 1.6 times greater than the minimal concentration of DTNB which gave zero residual activity (5.0 μm) for the enzyme sample studied. We propose that one molecule of DTNB reacts with one molecule of enzyme to give two molecules of TNB product since the size of the burst is approximately twice the concentration of DTNB required to completely inactivate the enzyme. We have observed similar behavior with the SHP-1 catalytic domain alone (SHP1ΔNSH2ΔCSH2) (data not shown), demonstrating that the mechanism responsible for the 2:1 stoichiometry involves cysteine residues in the catalytic domain only. The stoichiometry of the burst reaction with respect to enzyme concentration was determined by comparing the size of the burst in the DTNB reaction at pH 5.0 with the protein concentration determined by UV absorption. Upon standing, SHP1ΔNSH2 loses activity because of oxidation of the active site cysteine. To minimize air oxidation, a freshly purified sample of SHP1ΔNSH2 was used for the burst measurement. An extinction coefficient for SHP1ΔNSH2 was calculated based on the numbers of UV-absorbing Tyr and Trp residues in the sequence together with average extinction coefficients for these residues derived from experimentally determined extinction coefficients of a large set of proteins, a method that has been shown to give acceptable accuracy (17Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Within experimental error, the size of the burst (14.6 ± 1.1 μm) was just less than twice the enzyme concentration determined directly by UV absorption (7.9 μm). Release of about. 1.8 eq of TNB in the burst relative to the protein concentration agrees well with release of about 1.6 eq of TNB relative to the minimal DTNB concentration required to inactivate the enzyme completely (above). These results confirm that one molecule of DTNB reacts with one molecule of enzyme in the burst phase to release two molecules of TNB product. The protein products of the reaction between the PTPase and DTNB at pH 5.0 were isolated by gel filtration chromatography at the end of the burst phase and after complete reaction. Enzyme isolated after the burst and enzyme isolated after complete reaction were both essentially unreactive toward pNPP, but activity was regained upon treatment with dithiothreitol. Dithiothreitol treatment of protein isolated after complete reaction resulted in release of TNB. In contrast, protein isolated after the burst phase gave no TNB release, indicating that this protein was not an enzyme-TNB mixed disulfide (ESSAr), a species that would release TNB under these conditions. Both forms of isolated protein behaved as monomers in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis experiments under nonreducing conditions, so these products were not intermolecular disulfides (ESSE). The stoichiometry and product isolation results presented above are consistent with formation of an intramolecular disulfide during the reaction of the PTPase with DTNB as shown in Fig.5. In the first step, the active site cysteine would react with DTNB to form an enzyme-TNB mixed disulfide and release 1 eq of TNB. Subsequent rapid attack of another (proximal) cysteine on the mixed disulfide would displace a second equivalent of TNB and form an intramolecular disulfide bond between the active site cysteine and the proximal cysteine. Together, these steps would make up the burst of TNB release and yield 2 eq of TNB. The initial reaction of the active site cysteine would be the rate-limiting step. Other cysteine residues would react slowly with DTNB to form mixed disulfides and release 1 eq of TNB each, giving a ratio of 3:1 in released TNB for complete reaction (six Cys) relative to the burst reaction at pH 5.0 (two Cys). Complete reaction with DTNB at pH 5.0 and 8.0 resulted in the observed release of 3.4 and 3.5 eq of TNB relative to the burst, respectively, and the burst was found to be 1.8-fold greater than the protein concentration determined by UV absorption (Fig. 1 A). This could arise if the enzyme sample contained a small proportion of enzyme oxidized at the active site, which would cause TNB release in the burst at pH 5.0 to be low, resulting in a ratio greater than the expected value of 3. Similarly, the TNB release during the burst reaction was found to be 1.6-fold greater than the minimal concentration of DTNB required for complete inactivation, less than the expected ratio of 2. This may also be caused by oxidation of the enzyme sample if the proximal cysteine became partially oxidized, which would reduce the size of the burst more than the concentration of DTNB required to inactivate the enzyme. To obtain evidence for or against the existence of a cysteine residue proximal to the active site as proposed in Fig. 5, we investigated the effect of pretreatment of the enzyme with PAO on the DTNB reaction. PAO is known to react selectively with vicinal dithiols to form stable dithiaarsenane adducts in many cases (23Kussman M. Przybylski M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 24Joshi S. Hughes J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11112-11116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although an exception has been reported (25Li J. Pickert C.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15829-15837Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with PAO at pH 8.0 was found to inhibit SHP1ΔNSH2 with IC50 = 5 μm (data not shown), and inhibition was reversed by addition of excess dithiothreitol, a competing dithiol. Pretreatment with excess PAO (100 μm) completely abolished the burst phase in the reaction of the PTPase with DTNB at pH 5.0; a slow reaction with a rate similar to that of the secondary phase in the absence of PAO was observed (Fig.6). Also, the size of the absorbance change in the reaction with DTNB at pH 8.0 was reduced to 66% of the value in the absence of PAO, close to the value expected for reaction with four cysteine residues out of the total of six in the SHP1ΔNSH2 sequence (67%) (Fig. 5). Thus, the data are consistent with reaction of PAO with the active site cysteine and another nearby cysteine to form a dithiaarsenane adduct, masking these two cysteines from reaction with either substrate or DTNB but leaving the four other cysteine residues free to react with DTNB. Although the data are consistent with the reaction of both DTNB and PAO with the active site cysteine and another nearby cysteine residue, it is conceivable there is more than one cysteine near the active site and that different proximal cysteines are involved in the DTNB and PAO reactions. 2We have found that chromatography using PAO covalently bound to agarose (ThioBond Resin, Invitrogen) is an effective final purification step for full-length and truncated forms of SHP-1. Like SHP1ΔNSH2, full-length SHP-1 gives biphasic kinetics in its reaction with DTNB at pH 5.0, and the reaction results in inactive enzyme. The stoichiometry of the burst reaction with respect to enzyme concentration was determined by measuring the size of the burst in the DTNB reaction at pH 5.0 for a freshly purified sample of full-length SHP-1 and comparing with the protein concentration determined by UV absorption. As for SHP1ΔNSH2, the burst (14.4 ± 1.4 μm) was twice the enzyme concentration determined directly by UV absorption (7.3 μm), confirming that the intramolecular disulfide is formed f"

Although TR isoforms are highly conserved in their DNA binding, ligand binding, and carboxyl-terminal transactivation domains, their amino-terminal regions are completely divergent. We examined the contribution of these amino-terminal sequences to TRβ1 function. An amino-terminally truncated version of rat TRβ1 lacking amino acids 4–89 was impaired in hormone-dependent activation in both yeast and mammalian cells. This defect was not due to impairment of DNA binding, because the truncated receptor displayed enhanced homodimer binding on several different TREs, indicating that residues in the amino-terminal domain of TRβ1 interfere with homodimerization of the receptor. The presence of an autonomous transactivation domain in the amino-terminal region was demonstrated by its ability to activate transcription in a constitutive manner when fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. Deletional analyses localized the residues comprising the amino-terminal transactivation region of TRβ1 to 19 amino acids residing between residues 69 and 89. Thus, the amino-terminal region of TRβ1 contains an activation domain (AF-1) that can modulate the function of the receptor and may allow for the fine-tuning of receptor activity in various target tissues.

The C segment, which comprises the DNA binding domain of TR, recognizes a consensus hexamer half-site: AGGTCA (4Glass C.K. Holloway J.M. Devary O.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1988; 54: 313-323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). This half-site is present in at least two or more copies in the thyroid hormone response element (TRE) of genes transcriptionally activated by TR. Half-sites can occur as direct repeats, palindromes, and inverted repeats, implying that TR has a great deal of flexibility when interacting with DNA. TR can function as a monomer, a homodimer, or a heterodimer with the retinoid X-receptor (RXR) in binding TRE sequences. The interaction with RXR greatly enhances thyroid hormone receptor binding and transcriptional activation from certain TREs (5Yu V.C. Delsert C. Andersen B. Holloway J.M. Devary O.V. Naar A.M.

Other TR functions, including nuclear localization, hormone binding, homodimerization and heterodimerization, and transcriptional activation, have been mapped to the sequences carboxyl-terminal to the conserved DNA binding domain (D/E region) (2Lazar M.A. Endocr.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In particular, the last 17 amino acids of the D/E domain of TR constitute a transactivation function (AF-2) that is conserved with other members of the steroid family (13Barettino D. Vivanco Ruiz M.D.M. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 14Baniahmad A. Leng X. Burris T.P. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 76-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This transactivation domain functions due to a conformational change in the presence of ligand which repositions the AF-2 domain relative to the receptor (15Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. McGrath M.E. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar).Different forms of the thyroid hormone receptor (α1, β1, and β2) share a high degree of homology throughout the C, D, and E regions but completely diverge in their amino-terminal A/B sequences. These forms are expressed in distinct developmental and tissue-specific patterns, implying that they possess unique properties (2Lazar M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 16Murray M.B. Zilz N.D. McCreary N.L. MacDonald M.J. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12770-12777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that the amino-terminal region is responsible for modulating the isoform-specific activity of the receptor. Other steroid receptors (e.g. estrogen, glucocorticoid) have been shown to contain an additional transactivation domain (AF-1) in the A/B region (17Metzger D. Ali S. Bornert J. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9535-9542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 18Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This activation domain varies in its activity in a tissue- and promoter-specific manner (20Tzukerman M.T. Esty A. Santiso-Mere D. Danielian P. Parker M.G. Stein R.B. Pike J.W. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 21Nagpal S. Saunders M. Kastner P. Durand B.

Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 616-627PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, evidence supporting the existence of a transactivation domain in the amino-terminal region of TR has been reported (23Tomura H. Lazar J. Phyillaier M. Nikodem V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5600-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 24Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14274-14280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences important for this activation function in TRα1 (25Hadzic E. Desai-Yajnik V. Helmer E. Guo S. Wu S. Koudinova N. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4507-4517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and TRβ2 (26Sjoberg M. Vennstrom B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4718-4726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have also been mapped. Much less is known about TRβ1 and the role of its amino-terminal sequences. Our goal in initiating these studies was to determine whether the amino-terminal A/B region of TRβ1 plays a role in receptor transactivation.DISCUSSIONMany functions of the TRs have been ascribed to the extended D/E region lying carboxyl-terminal to the DNA binding domain. This segment of 287 amino acid residues is critical for hormone binding, dimerization, and nuclear localization. In addition, amino acid residues from the D/E region are directly involved in transactivation. Fusion of the D/E region of TR to a heterologous DNA binding domain results in the formation of a ligand-dependent chimeric activator (45Baniahmad A. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10633-10637Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of this region has identified the carboxyl-terminal portion of the receptor (410–456) as being critical in this process (12Saatcioglu F. Bartunek P. Deng T. Zenke M. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3675-3685Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 13Barettino D. Vivanco Ruiz M.D.M. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 28Uppaluri R. Towle H.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1499-1512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of appropriate residues within this segment can lead to receptor variants that retain normal hormone binding and DNA binding properties but are altered in transactivation. Fusion of either 35 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of TRα1 or 17 amino acids from TRβ to a heterologous DNA binding domain can create a hormone-independent transcriptional activator (13Barettino D. Vivanco Ruiz M.D.M. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 14Baniahmad A. Leng X. Burris T.P. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 76-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the carboxyl-terminal region has been postulated to be involved in contacting other components of the transcriptional machinery to support transcriptional activation. The recent elucidation of the structure of TRα1 has shown that the carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain contributes to hormone binding, thereby allowing direct regulation by the hormone (15Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. McGrath M.E. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). This domain of TR is analogous to the well-characterized AF-2 domain of other members of the steroid/thyroid receptor family (for review see Ref. 46Gronemeyer H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 89-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). As first recognized by Danielian et al. (47Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), this segment contains several conserved residues across family members and likely represents a transactivation motif present in most or all family members. This region has been shown to interact with the coactivator protein SRC-1 in a hormone-dependent manner (48Onate S.A. Tsai S. Tsai M. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar).In addition to the AF-2 transactivation domain, many members of the steroid receptor family have been shown to possess a transactivation domain in the amino-terminal A/B region (46Gronemeyer H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 89-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The potency of the AF-1 transactivation domain varies widely depending on the cell and promoter context (19Nagpal S. Friant S. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 20Tzukerman M.T. Esty A. Santiso-Mere D. Danielian P. Parker M.G. Stein R.B. Pike J.W. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 22Folkers G.E. van der Leede B.M. van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 616-627PubMed Google Scholar, 49Bocquel M.T. Kumar V. Stricker C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2581-2595Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Thus, the amino-terminal activation domain may serve to modulate the activity of the AF-2 domain by adding a layer of regulation to the receptor response. Tomura et al. (23Tomura H. Lazar J. Phyillaier M. Nikodem V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5600-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) recently compared the transcriptional potency of β1 and β2 forms of TR, which differ only in the amino acid sequence of the amino-terminal region. The β1 form was found to be more potent in transcriptional activation than TRβ2 in NIH3T3 cells, suggesting the presence of an activation function in the amino-terminal region of TRβ1. Similarly, Hollenberg et al. (24Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14274-14280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) attributed the greater potency of TRα1 relative to TRβ1 in CV-1 cells to the unique amino-terminal domain of this isoform. Consistent with these observations, we present evidence that supports the presence of a transactivation function within the amino-terminal A/B region of TRβ1. In addition, we demonstrate that this transactivation function can activate transcription in a constitutive manner when fused to the carboxyl-terminal end of the GAL4 DNA binding domain. Thus, the amino terminus of TRβ1 contains an autonomous transactivation domain that can function in a hormone-independent manner, analogous to the AF-1 domain of the steroid receptors.The AF-1 transactivation domain was further delineated to 19 amino acids between residues 69 and 89 of the amino-terminal region. Unlike the carboxyl-terminal AF-2 domain, the 19 amino acid region identified in TRβ1 is not similar in sequence or amino acid content to the AF-1 domains of TRα1, TRβ2, or the other steroid receptors. This suggests that the AF-2 domain may evolutionarily represent the primordial transactivation domain of TR and that differences in the amino-terminal region may modulate the activity of different TR isoforms to allow unique promoter-specific or cell-specific actions. This is supported in yeast by the observation that TR activity can be significantly altered depending on the presence of the amino-terminal A/B domain of either TRα1, TRβ1, or TRβ2 when fused to the DNA and ligand binding domain of TRβ (data not shown). The peptide sequence between residues 69 and 89 of TRβ1 includes a relatively high frequency of serine and threonine residues that may implicate phosphorylation as being important for functional activity. Phosphorylation has been suggested to stimulate the transcriptional activity of human TRβ1 (50Lin K. Ashizawa K. Cheng S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7737-7741Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For chicken TRβ1, a phosphorylation site has been mapped to a serine residue located within the amino-terminal domain (51Goldberg Y. Glineur C. Gesquiere J.C. Ricouart A. Sap J. Vennstrom B. Ghysdael J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Given the divergent nature of the various AF-1 domains, it is interesting to speculate on how this domain interacts with the transcription machinery. Transcriptional activation may occur through the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal transactivation domains recruiting different components of the transcriptional machinery or by each transactivation domain contacting different regions of the same factor. Evidence for this latter idea was proposed by Baniahmadet al. (52Baniahmad A. Ha I. Reinberg D. Tsai S. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8832-8836Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) who showed that the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions of TR interact with different regions of TFIIB in vitro. TRs have also been suggested to interact with a variety of coactivators, such as SRC-1, that could be targets for AF-1 and AF-2 (48Onate S.A. Tsai S. Tsai M. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar, 53Lee J. Ryan F. Swaffield J. Johnston S. Moore D. Nature. 1995; 374: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Depending on the promoter context or the presence of tissue-specific transcription factors, the AF-1 domain of TRβ1 may be responsible for the isoform-specific effects of TRβ1. Interestingly, the importance of the amino-terminal region of TR in mediating isoform-specific functions with co-repressor proteins has also been suggested (54Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Madura J.P. Lee K. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28516-28520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).In addition to playing a role in transactivation, the amino-terminal region of TRβ1 appears to play a role in the process of dimerization. Deletion of the amino-terminal domain promoted homodimerization of TR on all DNA elements tested. Most notably, the truncated receptor was capable of forming homodimers even on DNA elements containing a single half-site. Based on structural work on the steroid receptors (55Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R. Sigler P. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), each half-site makes contact with only a single monomer (56Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). The exclusive formation of dimer complexes on this element suggests that a relatively stable homodimer is formed by the truncated receptor. Hence, it would appear that residues within the amino-terminal end act to inhibit the homodimerization of wild-type TRβ1. A similar observation was recently made by Hollenberg et al. (24Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14274-14280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) for the TRα1 form. However, a comparison of the amino-terminal sequences necessary for transcriptional activation and inhibition of homodimerization for TRβ1 reveals that the sequence requirements are distinct for the two characteristics. For example, the mutant receptor (Δ4–69)TRβ1 is still capable of activating transcription even though it displays enhanced homodimerization properties similar to (ΔN)TRβ1 (data not shown). These data suggest that the effect of enhanced dimerization of (ΔN)TRβ1 is not responsible for the loss of functional activity. This inhibition of TRβ1 homodimerization by amino acid residues of the A/B region adds to the growing circumstantial evidence supporting the TR/RXR heterodimer as the principal active form for mediating TR action.In mammalian cells, the unliganded receptor generally functions as a transcriptional repressor. This repression/silencing function is mediated through an independent domain of TR within the D region (14Baniahmad A. Leng X. Burris T.P. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 76-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,52Baniahmad A. Ha I. Reinberg D. Tsai S. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Desai-Yajnik V. Greene M.E. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and requires specific co-repressors (59Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar, 60Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). This repression function is dominant over the hormone-independent activation domain in the unliganded receptor on most promoter elements. Binding of hormone would then result in the dissociation of TR from the co-repressor and lead to transcriptional activation through the AF-1 and AF-2 domains.In yeast, the putative co-repressor that interacts with TR is not present, or not sufficiently conserved, to interact with TR. Consequently, TR displays a hormone-independent transcriptional activation in yeast, as well as a hormone-dependent activation. The AF-1 domain appears to be responsible for a significant portion of the hormone-independent activation, as the amino-terminally truncated receptor has reduced activity in the absence of hormone. A similar hormone-independent activation may occur in mammalian cells under certain circumstances (61Rahman A. Esmaili A. Saatcioglu F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31059-31064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 62Saatcioglu F. Deng T. Karin M. Cell. 1993; 75: 1095-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Why then is the amino-terminally truncated TRβ1 diminished in hormone-dependent activation in yeast? We postulate that the AF-1 of TRβ1 facilitates the function of the AF-2 domain to yield effective transcriptional activation. Activation by estrogen receptor in yeast and mammalian cells is highly dependent on the synergistic interaction between the AF-1 and AF-2 domains (63McInerney E.M. Tsai M. O'Malley B.W.

In mammalian cells, the relative potency of the two transactivation domains of estrogen receptor and retinoic acid receptor varies depending on the nature of coactivators present and the promoter context (20Tzukerman M.T.

Similarly, the AF-1 domain of TR could provide a means of modulating receptor activity to meet the needs of different genes and different cells and may be responsible for the isoform-specific effects of TRβ1. Thyroid hormones influence various aspects of development and homeostasis by regulating transcription of specific target genes. These actions are mediated via specific nuclear receptors, which are members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily (1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6292) Google Scholar, 2Lazar M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar).

The C segment, which comprises the DNA binding domain of TR, recognizes a consensus hexamer half-site: AGGTCA (4Glass C.K. Holloway J.M. Devary O.V. Rosenfeld M.G.

This half-site is present in at least two or more copies in the thyroid hormone response element (TRE) of genes transcriptionally activated by TR. Half-sites can occur as direct repeats, palindromes, and inverted repeats, implying that TR has a great deal of flexibility when interacting with DNA. TR can function as a monomer, a homodimer, or a heterodimer with the retinoid X-receptor (RXR) in binding TRE sequences. The interaction with RXR greatly enhances thyroid hormone receptor binding and transcriptional activation from certain TREs (5Yu V.C. Delsert C. Andersen B. Holloway J.M. Devary O.V. Naar A.M.

https://openalex.org/W2003337531,"We have investigated the effect of glucose on insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) binding to, and intracellular phosphorylation of, the IGF-II/mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) receptor in the insulin-secreting cell line RINm5F. Glucose, at a concentration of 3 mm, significantly increased binding of IGF-II to the cells. A further increase of the binding was observed at a glucose concentration of 10 mm. Scatchard analysis showed that the increased binding was caused by an increased number of the receptors rather than changes in affinity. This effect of glucose was also demonstrated in another insulin-secreting cell line HIT as well as in the human erythroleukemia cell line K562. Affinity cross-linking of the RINm5F cells, using 125I-IGF-II, revealed increased binding to the IGF-II/M6P receptor induced by glucose. The effect of glucose on IGF-II binding was mimicked by fructose (10 mm), but not by 3-O-methylglucose (10 mm), and was abolished by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor calphostin C, or down-regulation of PKC, but not by the protein phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid. Glucose dose dependently stimulated phosphorylation of the IGF-II/M6P receptor, an effect that was inhibited by down-regulation of PKC activity. This study suggests that the distribution of the IGF-II/M6P receptor in insulin-secreting cells can be regulated by glucose-induced phosphorylation, a mechanism mediated by PKC.

The IGF-II binding site is localized to residues 1508–1566 of the extracellular domain of the receptor (4Schmidt B. Kiecke-Siemsen C. Waheed A. Braulke T. von Figura K. J. Biol.

By binding of M6P-containing lysosomal enzymes to the IGF-II/M6P receptor, the enzymes can be transported from the site of synthesis or from the extracellular space to the lysosomes (2Roth, R.

The functions of the IGF-II/M6P receptors in transportation of the enzymes and degradation of IGF-II are accomplished by trafficking of the receptors between the plasma membrane and intracellular membranes (2Roth, R. A., and Kiess, W. (1994) Growth Regul., 4, Suppl. 1, 31–38.Google Scholar). Cellular events interfering with the receptor trafficking interfere with disposal of the lysosomal enzymes. It has been estimated that the majority of the IGF-II/M6P receptors are localized in the intracellular space, with about 10% of total receptors at the cell surface, in equilibrium with intracellular pools (7Braulke T.

Although little is known about the mechanisms of regulation of receptor trafficking, IGF-I, IGF-II, epidermal growth factor, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were shown, in certain cell types, to stimulate binding and endocytosis of the lysosomal enzymes (8Braulke T.

Rat insulin was from Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark.d-(+)-Glucose, d-mannose 6-phosphate, 3-O-methylglucose, d-fructose, okadaic acid (OA), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and calphostin C were from Sigma. [32P]Orthophosphate was from DuPont NEN. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was from Pharmacia. Antiserum against rat IGF-II/M6P receptor was a generous gift from Dr. Peter Nissley, Metabolism Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.Cell CultureThe rat insulinoma cell line RINm5F, the insulin-secreting cell line HIT, and the human erythroleukemia cell line K562 were maintained in RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium supplemented with 5% (K562) or 10% fetal calf serum (RINm5F and HIT), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.Binding AssaysBinding assays were performed as described previously (13Laurenzi M.A. Sandberg Nordqvist A.-C. Carlsson-Skwirut C. Zhang Q. Sara V.R. Neurosci. Res. Commun. 1995; 16: 37-43Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 24-well culture dishes and grown to 80% confluence. Cells were washed four times with HEPES buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 135 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.7 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 1.0 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.4, followed by incubation of the cells for 30 min at 37 °C with 125I-IGF-II or -I, in the presence or absence of 100 nm IGF-II, 1 μmcalphostin C, or 1 μm OA in HEPES buffer, 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, in the presence of various concentrations of glucose (0, 3, 10, or 20 mm), M6P (10 mm),d-fructose (10 mm), or 3-O-methylglucose (10 mm). After incubation, the cells were washed with ice-cold HEPES buffer and lysed in 0.1m NaOH. To down-regulate PKC activity, cells were incubated in culture medium with 1 μm TPA (14Arkhammar P. Nilsson T. Welsh M. Welsh N. Berggren P.-O. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) for 3 h before the binding assay. IGF-II binding to K562 cells was performed in cell suspension as described elsewhere (1Zhang Q. Hall K. Tally M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 154: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar).Affinity Cross-linkingConfluent cells were washed three times with HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 125I-IGF-II, in the presence or absence of unlabeled IGF-II (100 nm), in HEPES buffer, 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, with increasing concentrations of glucose (0, 10, or 20 mm). Affinity cross-linking was carried out as described previously (15Pilch P.F. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3375-3381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), after washing of cells in ice-cold phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Cells were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions.32P Labeling and Immunoprecipitation of the IGF-II/M6P Receptor32P labeling and immunoprecipitation of the IGF-II/M6P receptor was performed as described previously (9Hu K.-Q. Backer J.M. Sahagian G. Feener E.P. King G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13864-13870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Cells were grown in 6-cm culture dishes to 80% confluence. Cells were incubated for 3 h in the presence or absence of 1 μm TPA. Incubation of the cells with 32P (30 μCi/ml/dish) was performed for 2 h at 37 °C in HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 50 μmNaH2PO4. Cells were incubated further for 5 min in the absence or presence of 3 or 10 mm glucose. The reaction was stopped by freezing cells in liquid nitrogen, followed by solubilizing cells in a lysis buffer containing 50 mmHEPES, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 4 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, and 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 60 min). The supernatant was incubated with antibodies against rat IGF-II/M6P receptor (1:100) overnight at 4 °C with shaking. The immunocomplexes were precipitated by protein A-Sepharose CL-4B for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads with proteins were washed three times with lysis buffer. The proteins were solubilized in the lysis buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE (7%) under reducing conditions.RESULTSSpecific binding of 125I-IGF-II to RINm5F cells in the absence of glucose at 37 °C was 18.6%, which significantly increased to 21.7 and 25.7% at glucose concentrations of 3 and 10 mm, respectively (Fig.1 A). Further increase of the glucose concentration from 10 to 20 mm caused no change in the IGF-II binding. The specificity of the IGF-II/M6P receptor in the binding assays was evaluated by competitive inhibition studies, where the radiolabeled IGF-II bound to the cells was displaced by unlabeled IGF-II, but not by IGF-I and insulin (1Zhang Q. Hall K. Tally M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 154: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Scatchard analysis of the binding data (inset in A) revealed a parallel right shift induced by glucose and showed that glucose (10 mm) increased the number of IGF-II binding sites per cell from 4.3 × 104 to 6.1 × 104 without changing the affinity for IGF-II. Insulin did not significantly increase IGF-II binding at a concentration of 2 nm, which is about 50-fold higher than what is secreted from a similar number of RINm5F cells for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 20 mm glucose (data not shown). The stimulatory effect of glucose on IGF-II binding was also investigated in another insulin-secreting cell line HIT (Fig. 1 B). Glucose increased IGF-II binding to HIT cells, and Scatchard analysis of the binding data revealed a significant and parallel right shift induced by glucose (inset in B). In addition, in the human erythroleukemia cell line K562, where receptors for IGF-II, but not for IGF-I, are present, glucose increased the 125I-IGF-II binding similar to that of RINm5F cells and HIT cells (Fig.1 C). Scatchard analysis of the binding data (inset in C) again showed a significant and parallel right shift induced by glucose. In contrast, no significant changes were found in 125I-IGF-I binding to the RINm5F cells in the presence or absence of 10 mm glucose (Fig.1 D).Affinity cross-linking of RINm5F cells with 125I-IGF-II revealed a 250-kDa protein band, enhanced by 10 or 20 mmglucose, and displaced by 100 nm unlabeled IGF-II (Fig.2). An additional protein band of about 80 kDa was also stimulated by glucose. However, unlabeled IGF-II failed to compete with labeled IGF-II for binding to the latter protein. Density analysis of the 250-kDa protein bands with a scanner connected to a computer revealed a 41% increase in the presence of 10 mm glucose compared with that with 0 mmglucose.Figure 2Affinity cross-linking of RINm5F cells using125I-IGF-II in the presence (*) or absence of 100 nm IGF-II and glucose, at the indicated concentrations.

In the absence of glucose, neither the protein phosphatase inhibitor, OA (1 μm) nor the protein kinase C inhibitor, calphostin C (1 μm), had a significant effect on IGF-II binding to the cells. However, calphostin C, but not OA, completely abolished the IGF-II binding stimulated by 10 mm glucose. A combination of OA with calphostin C did not show an additional effect (Fig.4 A). Down-regulation of PKC activity by TPA (1 μm, 3 h) prevented the stimulatory effect of glucose on IGF-II binding to the cells (Fig.4 B).Figure 3Binding of 125I-IGF-II to RINm5F cells in the absence (−) or presence of 10 mm glucose (G), fructose (F), 3-O-methylglucose (MG) or mannose 6-phosphate (M6P).

A major protein band of 250 kDa, precipitated by anti-rat IGF-II/M6P receptor antibodies, was phospho-labeled and was enhanced in density by glucose in a dose-dependent manner. Down-regulation of PKC activity with TPA inhibited the stimulatory effect of glucose. Density analysis of the IGF-II/M6P receptor protein bands revealed that the density, compared with that at 0 mm glucose, increased 124 and 283% at glucose concentrations of 3 and 10 mm, respectively.Figure 5Effect of glucose on the phosphorylation state of the IGF-II/M6P receptor in RINm5F cells. Cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate before addition of glucose. Labeled cells were solubilized, and proteins were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against rat IGF-II/M6P receptor. PKC down-regulation of cells was achieved by preincubation with TPA (1 μm, 3 h) before phospholabeling (*). An equal amount of protein was applied in each lane. Glucose concentrations and positions of protein molecular mass standards (in kDa) are indicated. A representative experiment out of three is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe present study shows that glucose increases IGF-II binding to the IGF-II/M6P receptor. A PKC inhibitor, calphostin C, but not the protein phosphatase inhibitor OA, was able to prevent the glucose-induced increase in IGF-II binding. The increased IGF-II binding to the cells induced by glucose was due to an increased number of the IGF-II/M6P receptor at the cell surface, which was associated with an increased phosphorylation of the receptors.The stimulatory effect of glucose on IGF-II binding to the cells can also be achieved by fructose, which is phosphorylated to fructose 6-phosphate in the cells, but not by the unmetabolizable sugar 3-O-methylglucose, suggesting a requirement of sugar metabolism in the glucose-stimulated binding. The fact that both fructose and glucose have stimulatory effects indicates that the early step of glucose metabolism, phosphorylation of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate catalyzed by glucokinase, is not required in this event.The effect of glucose on IGF-II binding cannot be attributed to insulin secretion from the cells, since RINm5F cells have limited insulin content and do not respond to glucose with insulin release (16Praz G.A. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Blondel B. Strauss A.J. Renold A.E. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In our hands, insulin release from the cells slightly increased when the glucose concentration was increased from 0 to 3 mm. No further increase was observed at concentrations above 3 mm. 2Q. Zhang, P.-O. Berggren, and M. Tally, unpublished observations. In addition, insulin added to the incubation medium had no effect on the IGF-II binding. Furthermore, when insulin was completely absent during the experiments, such as in the case of K562 cells, glucose stimulated IGF-II binding to the cells in the same manner as that in RINm5F cells.Glucose-induced activation of PKC has been observed in pancreatic islets and β cells through generation of diacylglycerol (17Wollheim C.B.

Invest. 1988; 81: 1154-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A PKC-activating phorbol ester, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, enhanced IGF-II/M6P receptor distribution to the cell surface, an effect which was not altered by OA (5Braulke T. Mieskes G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17347-17353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hu K.-Q. Backer J.M. Sahagian G. Feener E.P. King G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13864-13870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, IGF-II-stimulated redistribution of the receptor was prevented by OA treatment (5Braulke T. Mieskes G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17347-17353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of two different regulatory pathways, namely, the phorbol ester-sensitive PKC pathway and the OA-sensitive protein phosphatase pathway, in the regulation of the IGF-II/M6P receptor distribution. The glucose-induced IGF-II binding to RINm5F cells was abolished by calphostin C, but not by OA, indicating that activation of PKC rather than inhibition of protein phosphatases was essential for the glucose-induced receptor distribution.Insulin-stimulated redistribution of the IGF-II/M6P receptor to the plasma membrane is associated with a decreased internalization and phosphorylation state of the receptor (12Corvera S. Roach P.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3116-3122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Corvera S. Folander K. Clairmont K.B. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

J. 1988; 250: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), while the PKC-induced increase of receptors at the cell surface is associated with an increased receptor phosphorylation (9Hu K.-Q. Backer J.M. Sahagian G. Feener E.P. King G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13864-13870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, glucose enhanced the number of IGF-II/M6P receptors at the cell surface, an effect that was accompanied by an increased phosphorylation state of the receptors. The increased phosphorylation of the receptor cannot be attributed only to an increase in number of the receptors, since the receptor binding and the number of the IGF-II binding sites increased 30–40% at 10 mm glucose, compared with 0 mm glucose, as demonstrated in both receptor binding assays and affinity cross-linking studies, while 10 mm glucose caused a 3-fold increase in receptor phosphorylation. The inhibitory effect of down-regulation of PKC activity in the glucose-induced receptor phosphorylation suggests the involvement of PKC. The PKC-dependent manner indicates that phosphorylation of the IGF-II/M6P receptor induced by glucose is distinct from that by insulin (12Corvera S. Roach P.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3116-3122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Corvera S. Yagaloff K.A. Whitehead R.E. Czech M.P. Biochem.

Chem. 1990; 265: 13864-13870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that generation of diacylglycerol by glucose metabolism leads to activation of PKC, resulting in an increased phosphorylation of the IGF-II/M6P receptor, and thereby increasing the concentration of receptors in the plasma membrane. This is especially interesting, given the fact that the IGF-II/M6P receptor may be involved in the regulation of insulin exocytosis in the pancreatic β cells (21Zhang Q. Tally M. Larsson O.

A., and Kiess, W. (1994) Growth Regul., 4, Suppl. 1, 31–38.Google Scholar). Cellular events interfering with the receptor trafficking interfere with disposal of the lysosomal enzymes. It has been estimated that the majority of the IGF-II/M6P receptors are localized in the intracellular space, with about 10% of total receptors at the cell surface, in equilibrium with intracellular pools (7Braulke T.

Although little is known about the mechanisms of regulation of receptor trafficking, IGF-I, IGF-II, epidermal growth factor, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were shown, in certain cell types, to stimulate binding and endocytosis of the lysosomal enzymes (8Braulke T.

In the present study, we have investigated the effect of glucose on IGF-II binding to, and phosphorylation of, the IGF-II/M6P receptor in the rat insulinoma cell line RINm5F. MATERIALS AND METHODSRecombinant IGF-II and IGF-I were generous gifts from Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden. Rat insulin was from Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark.d-(+)-Glucose, d-mannose 6-phosphate, 3-O-methylglucose, d-fructose, okadaic acid (OA), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and calphostin C were from Sigma. [32P]Orthophosphate was from DuPont NEN. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was from Pharmacia. Antiserum against rat IGF-II/M6P receptor was a generous gift from Dr. Peter Nissley, Metabolism Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.Cell CultureThe rat insulinoma cell line RINm5F, the insulin-secreting cell line HIT, and the human erythroleukemia cell line K562 were maintained in RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium supplemented with 5% (K562) or 10% fetal calf serum (RINm5F and HIT), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.Binding AssaysBinding assays were performed as described previously (13Laurenzi M.A. Sandberg Nordqvist A.-C. Carlsson-Skwirut C. Zhang Q. Sara V.R. Neurosci. Res. Commun. 1995; 16: 37-43Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 24-well culture dishes and grown to 80% confluence. Cells were washed four times with HEPES buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 135 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.7 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 1.0 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.4, followed by incubation of the cells for 30 min at 37 °C with 125I-IGF-II or -I,"

Three amino acid residues, Ser-155, Ser-175, and Ala-185, which span this region of cytochromeb, were selected for this study. The S155C substitution yields cells unable to support photosynthetic growth, indicating that Ser-155 is a critical amino acid residue. Further mutational studies of Ser-155 indicate that the size of the amino acid side chain at this position is critical for photosynthetic growth of R. sphaeroides. On the other hand, the S175C and A185C substitutions yield cells with photosynthetic growth rates and enzyme kinetics of thebc 1 complexes very similar to those of the unmutated complex, indicating that Ser-175 and Ala-185 are noncritical residues. Thus, engineered cysteines at these two positions of cytochrome b are suitable for membrane topology and domain/subunit interaction studies. Cys-175 does not react with a sulfhydryl-modifying reagent, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), either in sealed, inside-out chromatophores or in detergent-disrupted chromatophores, indicating that position 175 of cytochromeb is inaccessible from both sides of the membrane and is probably buried within the protein complex. Cys-185 reacts with NEM only after detergent disruption of the sealed, inside-out chromatophores, indicating that this position of cytochromeb is accessible on the outer (periplasmic) surface of the membrane. These results place the cd helix of cytochrome bon the periplasmic side of the chromatophore membrane. When purified A185C-substituted bc 1 complex was treated with NEM, about 87% of the activity was abolished due to NEM modification of Cys-185. The signature of the Rieske iron-sulfur center is broadened upon NEM modification of A185C, with the g xsignal shifting from g = 1.80 to g = 1.75, suggesting that Ala-185 of cytochrome b interacts with the iron-sulfur protein. When purified S175C-substitutedbc 1 complex is treated with NEM, no change in the activity is observed, since Cys-175 is inaccessible to NEM. However, when the iron-sulfur protein is removed from the S175C-substituted bc 1 complex, Cys-175 becomes accessible to NEM, indicating that Ser-175 of cytochrome bis shielded by the iron-sulfur protein in thebc 1 complex.

https://openalex.org/W2122022607,"Pro-urokinase has a much higher intrinsic catalytic activity than other zymogens of the serine protease family. Lys300(c143) in an apparent “flexible loop” region (297–313) was previously shown to be an important determinant of this intrinsic catalytic activity. This was related to the loop allowing the positive charge of Lys300(c143) to transiently interact with Asp355(c194), thereby inducing an active conformation of the protease domain (Liu, J. N., Tang, W., Sun, Z., Kung, W., Pannell, R., Sarmientos, P., and Gurewich, V. (1996)Biochemistry 35, 14070–14076). To further test this hypothesis, the charge at position 300(c143) and the flexibility of the loop were altered using site-directed mutagenesis designed according to a computer model to affect the interaction between Lys300(c143) and Asp355(c194). When the charge at Lys300(c143) but not Lys313(c156) was reduced, a significant reduction in the intrinsic catalytic activity occurred. Similarly, when the flexibility (wobbliness) of the loop was enhanced reducing the size of side chain, the intrinsic catalytic activity was also reduced. By contrast, when the loop was made less flexible, the intrinsic catalytic activity was increased. These findings were consistent with the hypothesis. The effects of these mutations on two-chain activity were less and often discordant with the intrinsic catalytic activity, indicating that they can be modulated independently. This structure-function disparity can be exploited to create a more zymogenic pro-urokinase (lower intrinsic catalytic activity) with a high catalytic activity, as exemplified by two of the mutants. The changes in intrinsic catalytic activity and two-chain activity induced by the mutations were due to changes ink cat rather than K m. Some significant structure-function differences between pro-urokinase and its highly homologous counterpart, tissue plasminogen activator, were also found.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8408-8410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the existence of a unique hypercatalytic transitional state against plasminogen during the conversion or pro-UK to UK (11Liu J. Pannell R. Gurewich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15289-15292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its strong fibrin promotion, which gives the ICA of pro-UK an activity equivalent to the TCA of UK (12Liu J.N. Gurewich V. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6311-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The structural basis of these unusual properties remains unknown. For this reason, the high ICA of pro-UK was recently investigated using a three-dimensional homology model of the protease domain calculated from the crystallographic structure of trypsinogen. A single charged residue Lys300(c143) 2“(cnnn)” next to the position numbers of residues indicates chymotrysin numbering. 2“(cnnn)” next to the position numbers of residues indicates chymotrysin numbering. was identified that appeared to serve as a surrogate of the neo terminal Ile159(c16) of two-chain UK and interacts with Asp355(c194) to induce an active conformation of the protease domain. When the positive charge in this position was neutralized by site-directed mutagenesis (Lys300(c143) → Ala), a 40-fold reduction in the ICA occurred, consistent with the hypothesis (13Liu J.N. Tang W. Sun Z. Kung W. Pannell R. Sarmientos P. Gurewich V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14070-14076Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It was noted that the Lys300(c143) residue was located in a loop region (297–313) believed to be “flexible” because of its very high isotropic temperature factor in the homologous structures of trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen (13Liu J.N. Tang W. Sun Z. Kung W. Pannell R. Sarmientos P. Gurewich V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14070-14076Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The function of this “flexible loop” in serine proteases is unknown, although it is a part of the activation domain important in trypsinogen activation (14Huber A. Bode W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1978; 11: 114-122Crossref Scopus (608) Google Scholar). In the case of pro-UK, we postulated that this loop was involved in the interaction of Lys300(c143) and Asp355(c194). Because the ICA was believed to be determined by this interaction, altering the flexibility by mutations in the loop should result in changes in the ICA of pro-UK. The effect of mutations in this region on the TCA is unknown, but the recently published x-ray structure of low molecular weight UK (15Spraggon G. Phillips C. Nowak U.K. Ponting C.P. Saunders D. Dobson C.M. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Structure. 1995; 3: 681-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) suggested that the flexible loop mutations could also influence the TCA of UK by modulating the charge interaction between Asp355(c194) and Ile159(c16). In this study, the function of the flexible loop on the ICA and TCA of u-PA was examined by characterizing selected u-PA mutants in which the charge at position300(c143) or the flexibility of the loop region was altered. The synthetic chromogenic substrate for UK (S2444) was obtained from Kabi (Franklin, OH). Lys plasmin was obtained from American Diagnostica Inc. (Greenwich, CT). Enzymes and reagents for gene manipulation and expression of pro-UK were purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA) and Boehringer Mannheim. S-Sepharose, Sephadex G-25, benzamidine-Sepharose, aprotinin, and aprotinin-Sepharose were from Sigma. Based on the three-dimensional structural model of the pro-UK catalytic domain (Fig.1), the following residues within the flexible loop were selected for site-directed mutagenesis to test the influence of charge at position300(143) or flexibility of the loop on the ICA and TCA of u-PA (see Table I).Table IFlexible loop mutations and their effectsMutationRelevant structural change based on modelFunctional changeICATCATyr306(c149) → GlyReduction of side chain to increase flexibility11-fold less8-fold lessGlu301(c144) → His1-aCharge changes in positions other than 300(c143) were found not to affect the ICA or TCA and have been omitted from the table.Enlargement of side chain to reduce flexibility4.7-fold more2-fold lessGlu301(c144) → Ala1-aCharge changes in positions other than 300(c143) were found not to affect the ICA or TCA and have been omitted from the table.Reduction of side chain to increase flexibility12-fold lessNo changeGlu301(c144) → AspReduction of side chain to increase flexibility6.9-fold less1.5-fold moreLys300(c143)→ AlaElimination of positive charge40-fold less3-fold lessLys300(c143) → HisReduction of positive charge and enlargement of side chain5-fold less2-fold moreLys300(c143) → TrpElimination of positive charge and enlargement of side chain38-fold less6.6-fold lessLys313(c156) → Ala1-aCharge changes in positions other than 300(c143) were found not to affect the ICA or TCA and have been omitted from the table.(Positive charge eliminated)No changeNo changeSer303(c146) → Glu1-aCharge changes in positions other than 300(c143) were found not to affect the ICA or TCA and have been omitted from the table.(Negative charge added)No changeNo change1-a Charge changes in positions other than 300(c143) were found not to affect the ICA or TCA and have been omitted from the table. Open table in a new tab The mutant Tyr306(c149) → Gly was designed to increase the flexibility of the loop because its much smaller size allows the main peptide chain to move with less restraint and thereby destabilizes the interaction between Lys300(c143) and Asp355(c194). The mutant Glu301(c144) → His was made based on the premise that the large side chain of histidine would make the loop less wobbly, thereby stabilizing the interaction between Lys300(c143) and Asp355(c194) and increasing the ICA. However, the effect of Glu301(c144) → His could also be related to a charge change in this position, because Glu is negatively charged and His is partially positively charged. To evaluate this possibility, Glu301(c144) → Asp and Glu301(c144) → Ala were made. Asp has the same negative charge as Glu, and Ala is neutral. Because a Lys300(c143) → Ala mutation abolished the charge and reduced the ICA 40-fold (13Liu J.N. Tang W. Sun Z. Kung W. Pannell R. Sarmientos P. Gurewich V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14070-14076Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), a Lys300(c143) → His mutation was made to reduce rather than abolish the charge at this position. This was expected to induce a more modest reduction in the ICA. However, His has a large side chain that could also reduce the flexibility of the loop and increase the ICA by this mechanism. To determine whether the reduced charge or reduced loop flexibility was involved, a Lys300(c143) → Trp mutant was made. Trp has a larger side chain but no charge. A Lys313(c156) → Ala mutant was made because Lys313(c156) is the only other positively charged residue in the flexible loop. The comparable residue in t-PA (Lys429(c156)) was found to be important to its single-chain activity (16Lamba D. Bauer M. Huber R. Fischer S. Rudolph R. Kohnert U. Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 117-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 17Tachias K. Madison E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Finally, the mutation Ser303(c146) → Glu was made to serve as a control to show that mutations within the loop region do not necessarily induce changes in the catalytic properties of pro-UK or UK. As described previously (13Liu J.N. Tang W. Sun Z. Kung W. Pannell R. Sarmientos P. Gurewich V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14070-14076Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), site-directed mutagenesis was used to create the desired mutants of pro-UK. Briefly, the cDNA of the pro-UK mutant was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis after subcloning theHindIII-BamHI restriction fragment from pFC16 plasmid containing the full-length cDNA of pro-UK (18Orini G. Brandazzaa A. Sarmientos P. Molinari A. Lansen J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) into an M13 vector (mp18). A specific synthetic oligonucleotide coding for the designed site-mutant was first hybridized to the recombinant M13 vector and then extended with T4 DNA polymerase. Following ligation and transformation of bacterial cells, positive clones were selected for DNA sequencing. The expression plasmid for the mutant was constructed by reinserting the mutated HindIII-BamHI fragment in pFC16 and was then introduced into an Escherichia colitype B strain. Each pro-UK mutant was purified from sonicated cell lysates by chromatography through S-Sepharose, pro-UK antibody affinity column, and Sephadex G-25 after refolding by the method of Winkler and Blaber (19Winkler M.E. Blaber M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4041-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Trace amounts of UK were removed by passage over benzamidine-Sepharose followed by treatment with diisopropylfluorophosphate as described previously (10Liu J. Gurewich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8408-8410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Each purified pro-UK mutant was observed as a single band on reduced SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentration was determined from absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient (E 280 nm1% = 13.6) for pro-UK. The corresponding two-chain forms of u-PA or mutants were prepared by plasmin treatment of the single-chain precursors as described previously (7Pannell R. Gurewich V. Blood. 1987; 69: 22-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmin was removed with aprotinin-Sepharose. For hydrolysis of S2444, the single-chain forms (1.0–20.0 μm) were incubated with 0.6 mm of S2444 in 0.05 m sodium phosphate, 0.10 m NaCl, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% Tween 80 (pH 7.4) at room temperature. The reaction rate was measured by the linear optical density increase over time at 410 nm against a reference wavelength of 490 nm (410/490 nm) on a microtiter plate reader. 1.0–10.0 nm of the UK International Standard was used for the standard curve of S2444 activity of UK. The kinetics of S2444 amidolysis were determined using a range of concentrations (0.03–2.4 mm) of S2444, as described previously (20Liu J.N. Gurewich V. Blood. 1993; 81: 980-987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For hydrolysis of S2444, the two-chain forms (5.0–20.0 nm) were incubated with 0.6 mm S2444 in 0.05 m sodium phosphate, 0.10 m NaCl, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% Tween 80 (pH 7.4) at room temperature. The reaction rate and kinetics were measured as described above. To avoid interference from two-chain activity generated during the plasminogen activation assay of the single-chain forms, the following mutants were made to be plasmin-resistant by additionally mutating Lys158(c15) → Ala pro-UK and the mutants Lys300(c143) → Ala, Lys313(c156) → Ala, Glu301(c144) → Ala, and Lys300(c143) → His. Plasminogen (2.0 μm) activation by the two-chain forms (0.1 nm) and their single-chain plasmin-resistant counterparts (10 nm) was measured using the S2251 (1.5 mm) indirect assay as described previously (20Liu J.N. Gurewich V. Blood. 1993; 81: 980-987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using the synthetic substrate S2444 (0.6 mm), the ICA of wild-type pro-UK was determined to be 0.2% of its TCA, consistent with previous reports (7Pannell R. Gurewich V. Blood. 1987; 69: 22-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Petersen L.D. Lund L.R. Nielsen L.S. Dan⊘ K. Skriver L. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 2 A, the mutations changed the ICA from 40-fold lower to 4.7-fold higher than wild-type pro-UK. The mutant Tyr306(c149) → Gly, which greatly reduced the size at this position, reduced the ICA 11-fold. This finding was consistent with the hypothesis that increasing the flexibility of the loop by allowing it to move with less restraint would interfere with the stability of the interaction between Lys300(c143) and Asp355(c194). The opposite effect on the ICA was induced by the mutant Glu301(c144) → His, which was designed to reduce the flexibility of the loop by adding a large side chain (Fig.2 A). This mutation increased the ICA 4.7-fold, consistent with the hypothesis. Because His has a modest positive charge, a Glu301(c144)→ Ala was also tested. Ala is neutral and has a small side chain. This mutation induced a 12-fold reduction in the ICA compared with the wild-type pro-UK or induced a 55-fold reduction compared with the Glu301(c144) → His mutant. Therefore, the promoting effect of His301(c144) on the ICA was mainly related to its large side chain reducing the flexibility of the loop. A Glu301(c144) → Asp mutant induced a 6.9-fold reduction of the ICA (Fig. 2 A). Because Asp is similar to Glu in charge but smaller than Glu in size, this observation supports the concept that flexibility rather than charge was responsible for the changes in the ICA induced by mutations at position 301(c144). When Lys300(c143) was mutated to a less positively charged amino acid, histidine, the ICA was reduced by 5-fold. In contrast, the mutant Lys300(c143) → Ala, which eliminated the positive charge all together, induced a 40-fold reduction of the ICA (13Liu J.N. Tang W. Sun Z. Kung W. Pannell R. Sarmientos P. Gurewich V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14070-14076Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, the present findings are consistent with the concept that the charge interaction between position 300(c143) and Asp355(c194) is largely responsible for the relatively high ICA of pro-UK. The effect of the large side chain of histidine on the ICA was tested by the mutant Lys300(c143) → Trp. Tryptophan has a larger side chain but is neutral. This mutant reduced the ICA 38-fold, indicating that at this position in the loop, a positive charge was the major determinant of the ICA rather than flexibility. By contrast, at other positions in the loop, flexibility was the more important determinant of the ICA. By contrast, Lys313(c156), the only other positively charged residue in the flexible loop, when mutated to neutral Ala had no effect on the ICA. The comparable residue in t-PA (Lys429(c156)) has a major role in its single-chain activity (16Lamba D. Bauer M. Huber R. Fischer S. Rudolph R. Kohnert U. Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 117-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 17Tachias K. Madison E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), illustrating one of the structure-function differences in the protease domains of the two activators. The Ser303(c146) → Glu mutant had an ICA equivalent to that of the wild-type pro-UK, indicating that all mutations within the flexible loop do not affect function. These structural changes and their effects on the ICA are summarized in Table I. The ICAs against plasminogen were measured using plasmin-resistant (Lys158(c15) → Ala) mutants to eliminate the plasmin-mediated generation of two-chain enzymes. In the presence of 2.0 μm plasminogen and 1.5 mm S2251, the ICA of plasmin-resistant pro-UK was determined as 0.04 nmplasmin generated per min per nm activator. The ICAs of plasmin-resistant mutants Lys300(c143) → Ala, Glu301(c144) → Ala, and Lys300(c143) → His were about 40-, 9-, and 4-fold lower, respectively, than the ICA of pro-UK. These results were similar to the ICAs obtained with these mutants against the synthetic substrate, S2444. Using synthetic substrate S2444 (0.6 mm), the TCA of wild-type UK was determined to be 1.6 A × 10−3/min·nm, equivalent to 160,000 IU/mg. This was defined as 100%, the reference unit against which the activities of the mutants were expressed. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the mutations changed the TCA in a range from 8-fold lower to 2-fold higher than wild-type UK. Interestingly, the changes in TCA were often discordant with the changes in the ICA induced by these mutations, indicating that there are different mechanisms responsible for the two catalytic activities of u-PA. The mutant Lys300(c143) → His increased the TCA 2-fold, whereas it diminished the ICA 5-fold. The mutant Lys300(c143) → Trp reduced the TCA 6.6-fold, whereas it reduced the ICA 38-fold. Similarly, it was found previously that mutating Lys300(c143) to Ala reduced the TCA only 3-fold, whereas it diminished the ICA 40-fold (13Liu J.N. Tang W. Sun Z. Kung W. Pannell R. Sarmientos P. Gurewich V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14070-14076Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, position 300(c143) was of dominant importance to the ICA and influenced the TCA modestly but in the same direction. According to the x-ray structure of low molecular weight UK (Fig. 3), Lys300(c143) may be involved in maintenance of the hydrophobic environment around the neo N-terminal Ile159(c16), which forms a salt bridge with Asp355(c194) in UK. A similar phenomenon was reported for t-PA, and at the comparable position, a mutation (Lys416(c143) → Ser) also affected the TCA of t-PA (21Petersen L.C. Boel E. Johannessen M. Foster D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3451-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). At position301(c144), a complicated relationship between TCA and ICA was found. The mutant Glu301(c144) → Ala had no effect on the TCA, whereas it diminished the ICA 12-fold, probably by increasing the flexibility of the loop. The mutant Glu301(c144) → Asp increased the TCA 1.5-fold but reduced the ICA 6.9-fold. The mutant Glu301(c144) → His reduced the TCA 2-fold but increased the ICA 4.7-fold, probably by decreasing the flexibility of the loop. Therefore, the flexibility of the loop had little effect on the TCA, in contrast to the ICA. This could be explained by the interaction of Asp355(c194) and Ile159(c16) being much stronger than that of Asp355(c194) and Lys300(c143) in pro-UK. The stronger bond in the two-chain u-PA is less apt to be readily affected by motion of the loop. The mutant Tyr306(c149) → Gly is illustrative. This mutation reduced the TCA about 8-fold and reduced the ICA 11-fold by increasing the flexibility of the loop. In comparison with mutations at position301(c144), this mutation seems capable of inducing more dramatic changes in the flexibility of the loop, making it wobbly enough to disrupt even the interaction between Asp355(c194)and Ile159(c16) in the computer model (Fig. 3). The mutant Ser303(c146) → Glu had no effect on the TCA, showing again that mutations in the flexible loop do not necessarily interfere with catalytic activity (Table I). The activities of the two-chain forms (0.1 nm) against Glu plasminogen (2.0 μm) showed that the activating rate of UK was 1.0 nm plasmin generated per min per nmactivator. The TCAs of the mutants against plasminogen, in comparison with wild-type UK, were similar to that against the synthetic substrate, S2444. Zymogenicity was defined as the ratio of the TCA to the ICA. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the zymogenicities of mutations Lys300(c143) → Ala, Lys300(c143) → His, Lys300(c143) → Trp, Glu301(c144) → Ala, and Glu301(c144) → Asp were higher than wild-type pro-UK by 13.2-, 9.9-, 5.8-, 12.8-, and 10.3-fold respectively. In contrast, mutant Glu301(c144) → His was 10.4-fold less zymogenic than pro-UK. A kinetic study with a range of concentrations of the synthetic substrate was done for both the single-chain and two-chain mutants. It was found that the parameters ofk cat (catalytic reactivity) varied among the mutants, whereas K m remained unchanged, being 50–60 and 75–90 μm for single-chain and two-chain mutants, respectively (Table II). These kinetic constants were similar to those of wild-type u-PA (13Liu J.N. Tang W. Sun Z. Kung W. Pannell R. Sarmientos P. Gurewich V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14070-14076Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Liu J.N. Gurewich V. Blood. 1993; 81: 980-987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that changes in the ICA or TCA induced by the mutations were mainly due to changes in k cat. This finding was consistent with previous results that two-chain mutant Lys300(c143)→ Ala had the same K m but 3-fold lowerk cat than the wild-type UK against S2444 (13Liu J.N. Tang W. Sun Z. Kung W.

The catalytic reactivity of a two-chain serine protease is primarily determined by the spatial arrangement of the active site residues (His215(c57), Asp260(c102), and Ser356(c195)), formed by a charge interaction between Asp355(c194) and the newly released N-terminal Ile159(c16). We have recently provided evidence that in single-chain u-PA or pro-UK, this Asp355(c194) interacts with Lys300(c143), which acts as a surrogate of Ile159(c16) and that this charge interaction explains the relatively high ICA of pro-UK (13Liu J.N. Tang W. Sun Z. Kung W. Pannell R. Sarmientos P. Gurewich V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14070-14076Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Lys300(c143) is a positively charged residue situated within a loop region postulated to be highly flexible according to homologous structures in trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen. Therefore, it was proposed that alterations in the flexibility of this loop or the charge at position300(c143) would affect the ICA by modulating the charge interaction with Asp355(c194). Mutant forms of u-PA were designed based on the three-dimensional molecular model of the catalytic domain of pro-UK and characterized. Although the structural changes induced by the mutations could not be measured directly, computer modeling indicated that they would affect the interaction of Asp355(c194) and Lys300(c143). The corresponding effects on the ICA were monitored to evaluate the predictability of the model and to test the hypothesis. The changes in ICA induced by the site-directed mutations ranged from about 4.7-fold higher to 40-fold lower than wild-type pro-UK (Fig. 2 A). The TCA was also measured but was found to be less affected by these mutations, ranging from 8-fold lower to 2-fold higher than wild-type UK (Fig. 2 B). A number of the mutations induced discordant effects on the ICA and TCA (Fig. 2 and Table I). In contrast to the ICA, changes in the flexibility of the loop had relatively little effect on the TCA, probably because the interaction of Asp355(c194) and Ile159(c16) in two-chain u-PA is so much stronger than that between Asp355(c194) and Lys300(c143) in the single-chain form. Therefore, the latter is more susceptible to changes in loop flexibility. To our knowledge, the function of the flexible loop has not been studied in other serine proteases, although it has been defined as a part of the important “activation domain” by x-ray crystallography of trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen (14Huber A. Bode W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1978; 11: 114-122Crossref Scopus (608) Google Scholar). In the present study, flexibility was altered by mutations that changed the size of side chains. Those that decreased flexibility by increasing side chains stabilized the interaction between Lys300(c143) and Asp355(c194) according to the computer model and were shown to increase the ICA. The reverse effect on the ICA was induced by mutations that made the loop more wobbly by reducing the size of side chains. Reduction of the positive charge of the flexible loop at Lys300(c143) had a major effect on the ICA and a modest effect on the TCA, as previously found (13Liu J.N. Tang W. Sun Z. Kung W. Pannell R. Sarmientos P. Gurewich V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14070-14076Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, elimination of the charge at Lys313(c156) had no effect on either the ICA or TCA. The findings provide strong support for the validity of the computer model and support the hypothesis that the ICA of pro-UK is related to a charge interaction between Lys300(c143) and Asp355(c194), which is significantly influenced by the flexibility of the loop region (297–313). Although u-PA and t-PA are the two most homologous members of the serine protease family, they have several fundamental functional differences. For example, pro-UK is a zymogen, albeit with a relatively high ICA (0.2% of its TCA) (22Pannell R. Gurewich V. Blood. 1986; 67: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas single-chain t-PA is an enzyme that has a single-chain activity equivalent to 15–25% of its TCA (21Petersen L.C. Boel E. Johannessen M. Foster D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3451-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Madison E.L. Kobe A. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J.R. Goldsmith E.J.

Biochemistry. 1986; 26: 338-343Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and forms covalent complexes with plasma inhibitors (25Rijken D.C. Hoylaerts M. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2920-2925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, although plasminogen activation by both t-PA and pro-UK is strongly promoted by fibrin, t-PA mediates this by fibrin affinity, whereas pro-UK does not. Pro-urokinase selectively activates plasminogen bound to C-terminal lysines of the fibrin E-domain (12Liu J.N. Gurewich V. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6311-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26Liu J.N. Gurewich V. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 2012-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,27Pannell R. Black J. Gurewich V. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), whereas t-PA selectively activates plasminogen bound to an internal lysine in the fibrin D-domain (26Liu J.N. Gurewich V. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 2012-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28Voskuilen M. Vermond A. Veeneman G.H. van Boom J.H. Klasen E.A. Zegers N.D. Nieuwenhuizen W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5944-5946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, a number of structure-function differences between pro-UK and t-PA were identified that may help explain why some of their properties are different. Whereas the ICA of pro-UK was related predominantly to the positive charge of Lys300(c143) and was influenced by the flexibility of the loop (297–313), the activity of single-chain t-PA has been related mostly to a loss of the zymogenic triad (23Madison E.L. Kobe A. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J.R. Goldsmith E.J. Science. 1993; 262: 419-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and to certain individual residues such as Lys416(c143) (21Petersen L.C. Boel E. Johannessen M. Foster D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3451-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), His417(c144) (29Tachias K. Madison E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28749-28752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and Lys429(c156) (16Lamba D. Bauer M. Huber R. Fischer S. Rudolph R. Kohnert U. Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 117-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 17Tachias K. Madison E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The Lys429(c156) was suggested by the x-ray structure of t-PA to be a major determinant (16Lamba D. Bauer M. Huber R. Fischer S. Rudolph R. Kohnert U. Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 117-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) of its single-chain activity, whereas the comparable residue in pro-UK (Lys313(c156)) had no effect on the ICA. The function of the amino acid residue at position c144 provides an especially interesting comparison between pro-UK and t-PA. t-PA mutants, His417(c144) to Asp and His417(c144)to Glu reduced the single-chain activity by 4–6- and 6–14-fold against S2888 and plasminogen, respectively (29Tachias K. Madison E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28749-28752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In pro-UK, the comparable position 301(c144) is already Glu, and a Glu301(c144) to His mutation resulted in a 4.7-fold increase in ICA against S2444, whereas mutating it to Ala induced a 12-fold reduction. This suggests that the negative charge at position 301(c144) of pro-UK does not barricade the interaction between the Asp355(c194) and Lys313(c156), in contrast to what was recently proposed (29Tachias K. Madison E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28749-28752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, the structure-function relationship of one plasminogen activator cannot be assumed to be applicable to the other. The finding that the ICA and TCA of u-PA can be manipulated separately makes it possible to create a mutant u-PA with a lower ICA and a higher TCA as illustrated by the Lys300 → His mutant in which the ICA was 5-fold lower and TCA 2-fold higher than wild-type u-PA (Table I and Fig. 2). This could improve its therapeutic properties because a more zymogenic form of pro-UK would be more stable in plasma at pharmacological concentrations (13Liu J.N. Tang W. Sun Z. Kung W. Pannell R. Sarmientos P. Gurewich V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14070-14076Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Pannell R. Gurewich V. Blood. 1986; 67: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas a higher TCA should promote its fibrinolytic properties on the clot surface (27Pannell R. Black J. Gurewich V. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 30Gurewich V. Pannell R. Broese R.J. Mao J.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 82: 1956-1962Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In conclusion, a previous study suggesting that the relatively high ICA of pro-UK is related to a charge interaction between Lys300(c143) and Asp355(c194) is supported by the present study. This interaction was shown to be significantly influenced by certain neighboring mutations within a loop region (297–313) whose flexibility permits the interaction with Asp355(c194) to occur. Mutations designed, according to the computer model, to increase flexibility or wobbliness of the loop reduced the ICA by interfering with the interaction, whereas those that reduced flexibility increased the ICA by stabilizing the interaction. Reduction of the charge at position300(c143) also directly reduced the ICA. The TCA of u-PA was shown to be less influenced by changes in the flexibility of the loop, probably because the charge interaction between Asp355(c194) and Ile159(c16) is stronger than that with Lys300(c143). The ICA and TCA of u-PA could be modulated independently, a phenomenon that may be exploited for therapeutic purposes. A number of structure-function relationships of the ICA of pro-UK were found to be significantly different from that of single-chain t-PA.
