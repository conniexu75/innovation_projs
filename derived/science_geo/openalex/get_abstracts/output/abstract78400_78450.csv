These attractants evoke the concentration flight or mass attack by individuals of both sexes2, but the females are much more responsive than the males3,4. When the insects arrive at the source of the attractant, they take part in boring, feeding, mating and oviposition."

If this energy was spent at a constant rate, with 100 per cent efficiency of conversion to mechanical work, the power provided would correspond to about 160 W."

https://openalex.org/W1968515034,"LIGHT strongly influences many aspects of growth in plants. There have, however, been few studies on the effects of light on cell division in non-green plant tissue cultures. In the course of investigating the physiology of cell division in developing callus cultures of Helianthus tuberosus it has been observed that light can have an inhibitory effect on cell division."

https://openalex.org/W2089005522,"THE absorption and retention of dietary strontium can be reduced by supplementing the diet with an equimolar mixture of barium and sodium sulphates1,2, calcium phosphates3, or sodium alginate4,5. The possibility of remedial measures to protect a population exposed to a high concentration of strontium-90 in the diet makes these results particularly interesting. Promising results have been obtained from each of the dietary supplementations, and the purpose of the present investigation was to compare the effectiveness of the different treatments in rats of the same strain and age in similar conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1982288017,"RESERPINE, guanethidine and syrosingopine, which are potent hypotensive drugs, have been shown to produce side effects suggestive of increased parasympathetic activity. Some of these effects, such as bradycardia and diarrhoea, are attributable to an increased acetylcholine content of heart and intestine1, 2."

https://openalex.org/W2058160086,IN considering the control of blood supply to tissues it used to be assumed that the calibre of a blood vessel decreased progressively as tone in the muscle of its wall increased.

https://openalex.org/W1988169267,"BECAUSE tetrodotoxin (TTX) was thought to “selectively” block excitatory inward sodium currents in squid giant axons1,2, Dudel et al. used TTX as an “independent check” of sodium currents in mammalian Purkinje fibres3. Unfortunately, TTX analysis of membrane currents is no longer possible because recent evidence suggests that neither TTX nor the excitation process is specific for sodium."
https://openalex.org/W2066070807,"MEASUREMENT of the relative velocities of corpuscles and plasma by timing the travel of traceable materials between different points in the living body1,2 shows that the mean transit time of the cells is appreciably less than that of the plasma and this is generally attributed to the effect of axial drift of the red cells in the minute vessels. Groom, Morris and Rowlands3 showed that the whole of the cell arrival curve was displaced in time ahead of the plasma arrival curve. Thus some of the red cells apparently advanced bodily ahead of the plasma with which they were injected. Whitmore4 compared these results with those of a theoretical hydrodynamic model, which he developed, and concluded that axial accumulation of cells in streamline flow should only affect the shape of the later portion of the cell-concentration curve; the initial rise of both curves should occur at the same moment and at a comparable rate. Thus such a model did not account for the observed time displacement of the whole cell curve ahead of the plasma curve and the advancement of the leading cells ahead of the plasma with which they were injected."
