https://openalex.org/W2070154483,"Bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are crucial to maintain lifelong production of all blood cells. Although HSCs divide infrequently, it is thought that the entire HSC pool turns over every few weeks, suggesting that HSCs regularly enter and exit cell cycle. Here, we combine flow cytometry with label-retaining assays (BrdU and histone H2B-GFP) to identify a population of dormant mouse HSCs (d-HSCs) within the lin−Sca1+cKit+CD150+CD48−CD34− population. Computational modeling suggests that d-HSCs divide about every 145 days, or five times per lifetime. d-HSCs harbor the vast majority of multilineage long-term self-renewal activity. While they form a silent reservoir of the most potent HSCs during homeostasis, they are efficiently activated to self-renew in response to bone marrow injury or G-CSF stimulation. After re-establishment of homeostasis, activated HSCs return to dormancy, suggesting that HSCs are not stochastically entering the cell cycle but reversibly switch from dormancy to self-renewal under conditions of hematopoietic stress. Bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are crucial to maintain lifelong production of all blood cells.

After re-establishment of homeostasis, activated HSCs return to dormancy, suggesting that HSCs are not stochastically entering the cell cycle but reversibly switch from dormancy to self-renewal under conditions of hematopoietic stress. Due to the presence of multipotent stem cells, regenerating tissues such as the skin, gut, and hematopoietic system undergo life-long self-renewal and have the capacity to generate terminally differentiated cell types of each lineage. Although it is generally assumed that most immature adult stem cells divide infrequently and are predominantly quiescent (Arai and Suda, 2007Arai F. Suda T.

However, one needs to consider that, although definitive in vivo functional stem cell assays are available for mammary and skin epithelial SCs as well as for HSCs, such assays are still lacking for most other stem cell types. Quiescence has been postulated to prevent stem cell exhaustion (Orford and Scadden, 2008Orford K.W. Scadden D.T.

The mouse hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) is probably the most well characterized adult stem cell, both phenotypically and functionally. Previous studies have proposed that HSC activity is enriched in the quiescent cell fraction of the bone marrow (BM) (Passegue et al., 2005Passegue E. Wagers A.J. Giuriato S. Anderson W.C.

In addition, resistance of HSCs to antiproliferative chemotherapeutic agents such as fluorouracil (5-FU) or hydroxyurea is thought to be due to their relative quiescence (Arai and Suda, 2007Arai F.

However, in vivo studies in the mouse using long-term incorporation of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) have challenged the existence of long-term quiescent HSCs (Bradford et al., 1997Bradford G.B.

Haematopoietic stem cells do not asymmetrically segregate chromosomes or retain BrdU.Nature. 2007; 449: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In these studies, the doubling time of individual HSCs was estimated to be between 17.8 and 30 days with the entire HSC pool turning over every 57 days. Moreover, these studies suggested that HSCs are a rather homogenous infrequently dividing pool of cells that regularly but asynchronously enter the cell cycle, thus excluding the existence of a dormant HSC population (Cheshier et al., 1999Cheshier S.H. Morrison S.J. Liao X. Weissman I.L. In vivo proliferation and cell cycle kinetics of long-term self- renewing hematopoietic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Haematopoietic stem cells do not asymmetrically segregate chromosomes or retain BrdU.Nature. 2007; 449: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In contrast, we report here the identification of a highly dormant HSC (d-HSC) population that harbors the vast majority of stem cell activity as shown by serial transplantation. Although these d-HSCs divide only five times per lifetime during homeostasis, they are rapidly and efficiently activated by G-CSF stimulation or in response to BM injury. Interestingly, after the blood system is repaired, activated HSCs return to dormancy, suggesting that HSCs reversibly switch between dormancy and self-renewal at the interface between homeostasis and repair. As “proof of principle” that mouse HSCs are bona fide adult stem cells, several investigators have succeeded in performing single-cell repopulation assays using BM subsets isolated by flow cytometry (Camargo et al., 2006Camargo F.D.

Recently, Kiel et al. reported that 47% of individually transplanted Lin−Sca1+c-kit+ (LSK) CD150+48− cells generated long-term multilineage reconstitution (Kiel et al., 2005Kiel M.J. Yilmaz O.H.

Previously, Nakauchi and colleagues showed that about 21% of single CD34negLSK cells had repopulation activity, while, importantly, CD34+LSK cells showed multipotent progenitor (MPP) but no significant HSC activity (Ema et al., 2005Ema H.

Long-term lymphohematopoietic reconstitution by a single CD34-low/negative hematopoietic stem cell.Science. 1996; 273: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar). In order to identify a putatively further enriched HSC population, the percentage of CD34neg cells within the LSKCD150+48− population was determined and found to be 29.7% ± 6.3%, suggesting that this CD34negLSK CD150+48− population should be very highly enriched for functional HSCs (Figure 1A). Since cycling appears to correlate inversely with stem cell activity (Orford and Scadden, 2008Orford K.W. Scadden D.T. Deconstructing stem cell self-renewal: genetic insights into cell-cycle regulation.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), the cell-cycle status of this and other previously identified HSC/progenitor populations (Wilson et al., 2007Wilson A. Oser G.M. Jaworski M. Blanco-Bose W.E. Laurenti E. Adolphe C. Essers M.A. Macdonald H.R. Trumpp A. Dormant and self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells and their niches.Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 2007; 1106: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) was determined by combining DNA content (Hoechst) with intracellular Ki67 expression (expressed in cycling cells, but not in quiescent G0 cells) (Wilson et al., 2004Wilson A. Murphy M.J. Oser G.M. Oskarsson T. Kaloulis K. Bettess M.D. Pasche A.C. Knabenhans C. MacDonald H.R. Trumpp A. c-Myc controls the balance between hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2747-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). As shown in Figures 1B and S1 available online, around 70% of the CD34negLSKCD150+48− population (hereafter, HSC), are in G0, and < 2% are actively cycling (S + G2/M phases), thus making them the most rare and by far the most quiescent LSK cell type. In contrast, 7-fold more of the CD34+LSK CD150+48− cells (MPP1) are actively cycling, and only 39% are in G0. As expected, MPPs expressing CD48 and CD135 are highly proliferative (26% S + G2/M and 16% G0) (Figure 1B) (Adolfsson et al., 2001Adolfsson J. Borge O.J. Bryder D. Theilgaard-Monch K.

These data suggest that the CD34negLSK CD150+48− population as a whole is cycling the least and may, therefore, contain a significant number of infrequently dividing or even dormant cells. The cell-cycle analysis performed above only measures the instantaneous cell-cycle status and, thus, is not sensitive enough to discriminate between infrequently dividing and bona fide dormant cells. A technique often used to detect nondividing cells in various tissues is the label-retaining assay in which DNA is labeled in vivo using BrdU followed by a long “chase” period that reveals long-lived dormant “label-retaining cells” (LRC) (Arai et al., 2004Arai F.

Hume W.J. Reid P. Cairns J. The segregation of DNA in epithelial stem cells.Cell. 1978; 15: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To visualize LRCs by flow cytometry, adult mice were labeled with BrdU for 10–13 days followed by a BrdU-free chase for up to 306 days. Almost all cells within each LSK subset can be labeled by BrdU after 13 days (Figure 2A). After 70 days of chase, the phenotype of BrdU label-retaining cells (LRCBrdU) in lineage-negative BM was analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 2B, LRCBrdU showed a 7-fold enrichment of LSK cells (top panels) compared to the non-LRC population (lower panels). Most strikingly, a significant proportion of LRCBrdULSK cells was CD34negCD150+48−, suggesting that lineage-negative LRCBrdU progenitors are highly enriched (about 120-fold) for cells with an HSC phenotype. To determine the proportion of LRCs found in each of the stem/progenitor subsets described in Figure 1B, the percentage of LRCBrdU in each HSC/MPP population was determined. As expected, the rapidly proliferating MPP and common myeloid progenitor (CMP) populations show only a very minor LRCBrdU population, whereas HSCs contained 32.7% ± 4.7% LRCBrdU, confirming the cell-cycle analysis shown above and suggesting that, over time, this population as a whole is by far the most quiescent among all stem/progenitor cell types examined (Figures 1B, 2C, and S2A). Kinetic analyses with a chase period from 0 to 306 days (Figure 2D) revealed that most populations had lost nearly all LRC activity after 70 days of chase. In contrast, the HSC population shows strikingly different kinetics retaining > 20% LRCBrdUs between 70 and 200 days and even ∼5% after 306 days of chase (Figure 2D), raising the possibility that a long-term dormant subpopulation may exist within this HSC population. To address this question, we first determined experimentally that a BrdU-labeled cell must undergo around 4.5 divisions before BrdU expression becomes undetectable by flow cytometry (Figure S2B). We then modeled the temporal dynamics of BrdU decay (Figure 2D) with a mathematical model, assuming the data was generated by a single population of cells with a homogenous division rate similar to a method used by Kiel et al., 2007Kiel M.J. He S. Ashkenazi R. Gentry S.N. Teta M. Kushner J.A. Jackson T.L. Morrison S.J. Haematopoietic stem cells do not asymmetrically segregate chromosomes or retain BrdU.Nature. 2007; 449: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). However, as shown in Figure 2E, this model does not fit our experimental data, so we extended this one-population ordinary differential equation (ODE) model to create a two-population version (Figure 2F). As a result, we observed a highly significant improvement in the goodness of fit with the two-population ODE model (Figure 2F, brown), predicting that the LRCBrdUCD34negLSKCD150+48− population most likely comprises two populations with different division kinetics: a d-HSC (red) subset (15%) dividing approximately every 145 days and a rarely dividing “activated” (a-HSC, green) population (85%) dividing around every 36 days (Figure 2F). These results were independently confirmed by modeling the same data using two different stochastic approaches: one based on a continuous time state-discrete Markov process in which confidence limits (±3 SD) can be determined (Figure 2G) and the other a Monte Carlo program that simulates individual cells (Figure 2H) (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Finally, we remodeled the BrdU-LRC data set recently reported by Kiel et al., 2007Kiel M.J. He S. Ashkenazi R. Gentry S.N. Teta M. Kushner J.A. Jackson T.L. Morrison S.J. Haematopoietic stem cells do not asymmetrically segregate chromosomes or retain BrdU.Nature. 2007; 449: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar (only three data points: days 40, 70, and 120 of chase) using our two-population ODE model. Curiously, we found that, while this data cannot readily be described by a single population, it can be explained with great accuracy by our two-population model in agreement with our own more extensive data set (van der Wath and Lió, 2008van der Wath R.C. Lió P. A stochastic single cell based model of BrdU measured hematopoietic stem cell.in: Heiner M. Uhrmacher A.M. Computational Methods in Systems Biology. Springer, New York2008: 387-401Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar) (Figure S4). In summary, by modeling BrdU decay in LRC-HSCs, over time we can reveal the presence of a dormant population that comprises about one-seventh of the CD34negLSKCD150+48− subset dividing once every 145 days, which is equivalent to about five divisions per C57/BL6 lifetime (Siegl-Cachedenier et al., 2007Siegl-Cachedenier I. Munoz P. Flores J.M. Klatt P. Blasco M.A. Deficient mismatch repair improves organismal fitness and survival of mice with dysfunctional telomeres.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2234-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Typically, localization of HSCs in the BM is assayed by injecting purified, labeled HSCs into the circulation, followed by histological analysis of the BM around 15 hr later (Nilsson et al., 2001Nilsson S.K. Johnston H.M. Coverdale J.A. Spatial localization of transplanted hemopoietic stem cells: inferences for the localization of stem cell niches.Blood. 2001; 97: 2293-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, Wilson et al., 2004Wilson A. Murphy M.J. Oser G.M. Oskarsson T. Kaloulis K. Bettess M.D. Pasche A.C. Knabenhans C. MacDonald H.R. Trumpp A. c-Myc controls the balance between hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2747-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). However, whether detection of HSCs using such “homing assays” indeed indicates their true niche location remains controversial (Wilson et al., 2007Wilson A. Oser G.M. Jaworski M. Blanco-Bose W.E. Laurenti E. Adolphe C. Essers M.A. Macdonald H.R. Trumpp A. Dormant and self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells and their niches.Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 2007; 1106: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Our findings that HSCs are highly enriched in the LRC fraction permit detection of “resident” dormant HSCs by immunofluorescence staining for BrdU and cKit (CD117) in bones of mice after 170 days chase. At this time point, the only cKit+ cells in the BM that are still BrdU+ are d-HSCs (data not shown). As shown in Figure S3, LRCBrdU;cKit+ cells can be detected both near the endosteum and more centrally in the BM. Importantly, LRCBrdU;cKit+ cells are always detected as single cells, indicating that niches harboring dormant HSCs are very small. To address the functional HSC activity of the dormant population, reconstitution experiments need to be performed. However, since it is necessary to fix cells to detect BrdU incorporated into DNA, LRCBrdU cells cannot be isolated alive nor can their functional activity be assessed. To circumvent this limitation and perform functional assays on label-retaining HSCs, we took advantage of a transgenic mouse line that expresses the fusion protein histone H2B-green fluorescent protein (H2B-GFP) under the control of a tetracycline-responsive regulatory element (Tumbar et al., 2004Tumbar T. Guasch G. Greco V. Blanpain C. Lowry W.E. Rendl M. Fuchs E. Defining the epithelial stem cell niche in skin.Science. 2004; 303: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). To obtain hematopoietic stem/progenitor-specific and doxycyclin-dependent expression of H2B-GFP, these mice were crossed to SCL-tTA-S2 mice (SCL-tTA) expressing the tTA-S2 transactivator from the endogenous scl locus expressed in both early embryonic and adult HSC/progenitor cells (Figure 3A) (Bockamp et al., 2006Bockamp E. Antunes C. Maringer M. Heck R. Presser K. Beilke S. Ohngemach S. Alt R. Cross M. Sprengel R. et al.Tetracycline-controlled transgenic targeting from the SCL locus directs conditional expression to erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, granulocytes, and c-kit-expressing lineage-negative hematopoietic cells.Blood. 2006; 108: 1533-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). More than 80% of HSC/MPPs isolated from 6-week-old SCL-tTA;H2B-GFP double heterozygous mice expressed GFP at high levels (GFPbright) (Figure 3B), whereas only much lower levels of GFP, (at least 1 log dimmer) were detected in these subsets isolated from control H2B-GFP (Challen and Goodell, 2008Challen G.A. Goodell M.A. Promiscuous expression of H2B-GFP transgene in hematopoietic stem cells.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or SCL-tTA single transgenic mice, or SCL-tTA;H2B-GFP mice that had been permanently treated with doxycyclin (Figure 3B and data not shown). Although around 20% of these stem and progenitor populations did not express detectable levels of GFP, no differences were observed in the phenotype of the GFP+ and GFP− fractions in any of the BM subsets prechase (Figure S3), suggesting that both populations are identical and that the differential expression of H2B-GFP is due to position effect variegation often observed with transgenes (Kioussis and Festenstein, 1997Kioussis D. Festenstein R. Locus control regions: overcoming heterochromatin-induced gene inactivation in mammals.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Similar to what was observed in LRCBrdU cells, after 70 days of chase (+ doxycyclin), LinnegGFPbright cells were highly enriched for noncycling CD34negLSKCD150+48− HSCs (LRCH2B-GFP) (Figure 3C). Furthermore, the proportion of LRCH2B-GFP cells was highest (35% ± 4.8%) in the HSC population and significantly lower in the more differentiated MPPs (Figure 3D). Kinetic analysis of LRCH2B-GFP within the HSC population shows that the rate of loss of LRCH2B-GFP cells over time is remarkably similar to that observed with LRCBrdU, suggesting that both techniques are highly equivalent (Figure 3E). This is also in agreement with recently reported data showing that five divisions are required for a H2B-GFP+ cell to be rendered undetectable by FACS (Waghmare et al., 2008Waghmare S.K. Bansal R. Lee J. Zhang Y.V. McDermitt D.J. Tumbar T. Quantitative proliferation dynamics and random chromosome segregation of hair follicle stem cells.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), consistent with what we have estimated for the loss of BrdU label (Figure S2B). For DNA to retain a label such as BrdU, two independent hypotheses have been postulated. First, it has been proposed in the “Immortal Strand Hypothesis” that stem cells divide frequently but, in doing so, asymmetrically recognize and retain the “old” labeled mother DNA strand while the newly synthesized “unlabeled” chromosomes are selectively distributed to the nonstem cell daughter (Cairns, 1975Cairns J. Mutation selection and the natural history of cancer.Nature. 1975; 255: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar, Potten et al., 1978Potten C.S. Hume W.J. Reid P. Cairns J.

Although some evidence for this controversial hypothesis has been provided in several cell types, including muscle satellite stem cells, the immortal strand segregation mechanism has recently been seriously challenged for HSCs (Kiel et al., 2007Kiel M.J.

Since we see highly overlapping decay kinetics in HSCs labeled either with BrdU (chromosomal labeling) or H2B-GFP (labeling of nuclear proteins), one would need to predict for the Immortal Strand Hypothesis to hold true—that not only chromosomes but also the histone-2B-GFP protein would have to be asymmetrically distributed, a rather unlikely assumption. Therefore, in the absence of any evidence that HSCs asymmetrically segregate their chromosomes, the observed label retention must be due to dormancy during the chase period. To confirm this experimentally, we determined the cell-cycle status of LRCH2B-GFP cells (CD34negLSK 150+48−) by DNA content and Ki67 expression after 204 days chase. As shown in Figures 3F and 6B, none (0.2% ± 0.3%) of these cells are in S/G2/M phases (compared to 1% in non-LRC cells of the same phenotype). Moreover, nearly all (99% ± 0.7%) are in G0 phase compared to 83% in non-LRCs, confirming that long-term label retention in HSCs is a highly sensitive parameter for quiescence. To address the molecular basis of dormancy, microarray analysis comparing dormant LRCH2BGFP (170 days chase) versus activated non-LRC HSCs was performed. This analysis revealed that expression of almost all genes involved in the assembly and activation of the prereplicative complex were downregulated in dormant HSCs. This includes key factors such as CDC6, CDC7, and DNA polymerase-α (Figure S5) (Coller, 2007Coller H.A. What's taking so long? S-phase entry from quiescence versus proliferation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 667-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These data show that LRC-HSCs have a greatly downregulated DNA replication machinery, which is consistent with the status of dormancy. Acquisition of CD34 cell-surface expression on adult HSCs is known to be one of the first events concomitant with loss of HSC activity (Furness and McNagny, 2006Furness S.G. McNagny K.

Indeed, although d-HSCs showed very little CD34 mRNA expression as expected, this gene is transcriptionally upregulated >100-fold in a-HSCs (Figure 3G) although they remain cell-surface CD34neg, consistent with the notion that the two HSCs and MPP1 show a close linear relationship (Figures 3G and 5). To compare the functional HSC activity of d-HSCs (LRCH2B-GFP HSCs) with a-HSCs (LRCneg HSCs), 50 cells of either phenotype were FACS sorted and transplanted into lethally irradiated NOD/SCID/γc mice"

To dissect the polygenic basis of these traits, we conducted genome-wide association screens in 19,840 individuals and replication in up to 20,623 individuals. We identified 30 distinct loci associated with lipoprotein concentrations (each with P < 5 x 10(-8)), including 11 loci that reached genome-wide significance for the first time. The 11 newly defined loci include common variants associated with LDL cholesterol near ABCG8, MAFB, HNF1A and TIMD4; with HDL cholesterol near ANGPTL4, FADS1-FADS2-FADS3, HNF4A, LCAT, PLTP and TTC39B; and with triglycerides near AMAC1L2, FADS1-FADS2-FADS3 and PLTP. The proportion of individuals exceeding clinical cut points for high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol and high triglycerides varied according to an allelic dosage score (P < 10(-15) for each trend). These results suggest that the cumulative effect of multiple common variants contributes to polygenic dyslipidemia."

Here we report the first GWA analysis of loci affecting total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides sampled randomly from 16 population-based cohorts and genotyped using mainly the Illumina HumanHap300-Duo platform. Our study included a total of 17,797–22,562 persons, aged 18–104 years and from geographic regions spanning from the Nordic countries to Southern Europe. We established 22 loci associated with serum lipid levels at a genome-wide significance level (P < 5 × 10−8), including 16 loci that were identified by previous GWA studies. The six newly identified loci in our cohort samples are ABCG5 (TC, P = 1.5 × 10−11; LDL, P = 2.6 × 10−10), TMEM57 (TC, P = 5.4 × 10−10), CTCF-PRMT8 region (HDL, P = 8.3 × 10−16), DNAH11 (LDL, P = 6.1 × 10−9), FADS3-FADS2 (TC, P = 1.5 × 10−10; LDL, P = 4.4 × 10−13) and MADD-FOLH1 region (HDL, P = 6 × 10−11). For three loci, effect sizes differed significantly by sex. Genetic risk scores based on lipid loci explain up to 4.8% of variation in lipids and were also associated with increased intima media thickness (P = 0.001) and coronary heart disease incidence (P = 0.04). The genetic risk score improves the screening of high-risk groups of dyslipidemia over classical risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2071759640,"Nelson Freimer and colleagues report the first genome-wide association study of a longitudinal birth cohort (the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966). The results include new associations for nine quantitative metabolic traits. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of longitudinal birth cohorts enable joint investigation of environmental and genetic influences on complex traits. We report GWAS results for nine quantitative metabolic traits (triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein, body mass index, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure) in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966), drawn from the most genetically isolated Finnish regions. We replicate most previously reported associations for these traits and identify nine new associations, several of which highlight genes with metabolic functions: high-density lipoprotein with NR1H3 (LXRA), low-density lipoprotein with AR and FADS1-FADS2, glucose with MTNR1B, and insulin with PANK1. Two of these new associations emerged after adjustment of results for body mass index. Gene–environment interaction analyses suggested additional associations, which will require validation in larger samples. The currently identified loci, together with quantified environmental exposures, explain little of the trait variation in NFBC1966. The association observed between low-density lipoprotein and an infrequent variant in AR suggests the potential of such a cohort for identifying associations with both common, low-impact and rarer, high-impact quantitative trait loci."

They find variants in the gene encoding melatonin receptor 1B that are associated with fasting glucose levels and, in a meta-analysis of 13 case-control studies, also show association with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. To identify previously unknown genetic loci associated with fasting glucose concentrations, we examined the leading association signals in ten genome-wide association scans involving a total of 36,610 individuals of European descent. Variants in the gene encoding melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B) were consistently associated with fasting glucose across all ten studies. The strongest signal was observed at rs10830963, where each G allele (frequency 0.30 in HapMap CEU) was associated with an increase of 0.07 (95% CI = 0.06–0.08) mmol/l in fasting glucose levels (P = 3.2 × 10−50) and reduced beta-cell function as measured by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-B, P = 1.1 × 10−15). The same allele was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio = 1.09 (1.05–1.12), per G allele P = 3.3 × 10−7) in a meta-analysis of 13 case-control studies totaling 18,236 cases and 64,453 controls. Our analyses also confirm previous associations of fasting glucose with variants at the G6PC2 (rs560887, P = 1.1 × 10−57) and GCK (rs4607517, P = 1.0 × 10−25) loci."
https://openalex.org/W2126776706,"Leif Groop and colleagues report that, in prospective studies, a variant in the gene encoding melantonin receptor 1B influences future risk of type 2 diabetes. Insulin release from pancreatic beta cells in response to glucose was inhibited by melatonin. Genome-wide association studies have shown that variation in MTNR1B (melatonin receptor 1B) is associated with insulin and glucose concentrations. Here we show that the risk genotype of this SNP predicts future type 2 diabetes (T2D) in two large prospective studies. Specifically, the risk genotype was associated with impairment of early insulin response to both oral and intravenous glucose and with faster deterioration of insulin secretion over time. We also show that the MTNR1B mRNA is expressed in human islets, and immunocytochemistry confirms that it is primarily localized in β cells in islets. Nondiabetic individuals carrying the risk allele and individuals with T2D showed increased expression of the receptor in islets. Insulin release from clonal β cells in response to glucose was inhibited in the presence of melatonin. These data suggest that the circulating hormone melatonin, which is predominantly released from the pineal gland in the brain, is involved in the pathogenesis of T2D. Given the increased expression of MTNR1B in individuals at risk of T2D, the pathogenic effects are likely exerted via a direct inhibitory effect on β cells. In view of these results, blocking the melatonin ligand-receptor system could be a therapeutic avenue in T2D."

In European populations, the rs1387153 T allele is associated with increased FPG (beta = 0.06 mmol/l, P = 7.6 x 10(-29), N = 16,094), type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk (odds ratio (OR) = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.08-1.22, P = 6.3 x 10(-5), cases N = 6,332) and risk of developing hyperglycemia or diabetes over a 9-year period (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.06-1.36, P = 0.005, incident cases N = 515).

https://openalex.org/W2150315067,"In normal circumstances, the Bcl-2 family dutifully governs when cells die. However, the rules of engagement between the pro- and antiapoptotic family members are still contested, and how Bax is transformed from a cytosolic monomer to an outer mitochondrial membrane-permeabilizing oligomer is unclear. With fluorescence techniques and an in vitro system, the combination of tBid and Bax produced dramatic membrane permeabilization. The membrane is not a passive partner in this process beause membranes are required for the protein-protein interactions to occur. Simultaneous measurements of these interactions revealed an ordered series of steps required for outer membrane permeabilization: (1) tBid rapidly binds to membranes, where (2) tBid interacts with Bax, causing (3) Bax insertion into membranes and (4) oligomerization, culminating in (5) membrane permeabilization. Bcl-XL prevents membrane-bound tBid from binding Bax. Bad releases tBid from Bcl-XL, restoring both tBid binding to Bax and membrane permeabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2076814468,"Most solid tumours are aneuploid and many frequently mis-segregate chromosomes. This chromosomal instability is commonly caused by persistent mal-oriented attachment of chromosomes to spindle microtubules. Chromosome segregation requires stable microtubule attachment at kinetochores, yet those attachments must be sufficiently dynamic to permit correction of mal-orientations. How this balance is achieved is unknown, and the permissible boundaries of attachment stability versus dynamics essential for genome stability remain poorly understood. Here we show that two microtubule-depolymerizing kinesins, Kif2b and MCAK, stimulate kinetochore-microtubule dynamics during distinct phases of mitosis to correct mal-orientations. Few-fold reductions in kinetochore-microtubule turnover, particularly in early mitosis, induce severe chromosome segregation defects. In addition, we show that stimulation of microtubule dynamics at kinetochores restores stability to chromosomally unstable tumour cell lines, establishing a causal relationship between deregulation of kinetochore-microtubule dynamics and chromosomal instability. Thus, temporal control of microtubule attachment to chromosomes during mitosis is central to genome stability in human cells."

The catalytic component of the exosome is the Dis3 subunit. Dis3 contains a PIN domain, which is sometimes associated with nuclease activity. In this work, Lebreton et al. show that the Dis3 PIN domain possesses endonuclease activity (that is, it can cleave RNA internally, rather than from an end). Mutations in either this domain or in the exonuclease domain exhibit a growth phenotype, suggesting that both activities are physiologically important. While other RNase complexes contain both endo- and exonuclease activities, this is the first example of both activities being encoded in a single protein. The exosome is a multisubunit exonuclease complex that degrades many types of RNAs, in many different contexts, in a 3′ to 5′ manner. The catalytic component of the exosome is the Dis3 subunit. Dis3 contains a PIN domain, which is sometimes associated with nuclease activity. This work shows that the Dis3 PIN domain also possesses endonuclease activity (that is, it can cleave RNA internally, rather than from an end). Mutations in either this domain or in the exonuclease domain exhibit a growth phenotype, suggesting that both activities are physiologically important. The exosome is a major eukaryotic nuclease located in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm that contributes to the processing, quality control and/or turnover of a large number of cellular RNAs1,2,3,4,5,6. This large macromolecular assembly has been described as a 3′→5′ exonuclease1 and shown to contain a nine-subunit ring structure evolutionarily related to archaeal exosome-like complexes and bacterial polynucleotide phosphorylases. Recent results have shown that, unlike its prokaryotic counterparts, the yeast and human ring structures are catalytically inactive. In contrast, the exonucleolytic activity of the yeast exosome core was shown to be mediated by the RNB domain of the eukaryote-specific Dis3 subunit7,8,9. Here we show, using in vitro assays, that yeast Dis3 has an additional endoribonuclease activity mediated by the PIN domain located at the amino terminus of this multidomain protein. Simultaneous inactivation of the endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic activities of the exosome core generates a synthetic growth phenotype in vivo, supporting a physiological function for the PIN domain. This activity is responsible for the cleavage of some natural exosome substrates, independently of exonucleolytic degradation. In contrast with current models, our results show that eukaryotic exosome cores have both endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic activities, mediated by two distinct domains of the Dis3 subunit. The mode of action of eukaryotic exosome cores in RNA processing and degradation should be reconsidered, taking into account the cooperation between its multiple ribonucleolytic activities."
https://openalex.org/W2085169607,"The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway represents one subgroup of MAP kinases that are activated primarily by cytokines and exposure to environmental stress. Autophagy is a protein-degradation system characterized by the formation of double-membrane vacuoles termed autophagosomes. Autophagy-related gene beclin 1 plays a key role in autophagosome formation. However, the relationships between activation of JNK pathway, autophagy induction and Beclin 1 expression remain elusive. In this study, we used human cancer cell lines CNE2 and Hep3B to investigate the role of JNK-mediated Beclin 1 expression in ceramide-induced autophagic cell death. Ceramide-treated cells exhibited the characteristics of autophagy (that is, acidic vesicular organelle formation and the LC3-II generation). JNK was activated in these two cell lines exposed to ceramide and the phosphorylation of c-Jun also increased. In the meantime, we found that ceramide upregulated Beclin 1 expression in cancer cells. The upregulation of Beclin 1 expression could be blocked by SP600125 (a specific inhibitor of JNK) or a small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against JNK1/2 or c-Jun. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter analysis revealed that c-Jun was involved in the regulation of beclin 1 transcription in response to ceramide treatment. In addition, inhibition of JNK activity by SP600125 could inhibit autophagy induction by ceramide. Furthermore, Beclin 1 knockdown by siRNA also inhibited ceramide-mediated autophagic cell death. JNK-mediated Beclin 1 expression was also observed in topotecan-induced autophagy. These data suggest that activation of JNK pathway can mediate Beclin 1 expression, which plays a key role in autophagic cell death in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2089112805,"Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and Sirtuin 2 (Sirt2) belong to the family of NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-positive)-dependent class III histone deacetylases and are involved in regulating lifespan. As cancer is a disease of ageing, targeting Sirtuins is emerging as a promising antitumour strategy. Here we present Salermide (N-{3-[(2-hydroxy-naphthalen-1-ylmethylene)-amino]-phenyl}-2-phenyl-propionamide), a reverse amide with a strong in vitro inhibitory effect on Sirt1 and Sirt2. Salermide was well tolerated by mice at concentrations up to 100 μM and prompted tumour-specific cell death in a wide range of human cancer cell lines. The antitumour activity of Salermide was primarily because of a massive induction of apoptosis. This was independent of global tubulin and K16H4 acetylation, which ruled out a putative Sirt2-mediated apoptotic pathway and suggested an in vivo mechanism of action through Sirt1. Consistently with this, RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Sirt1, but not Sirt2, induced apoptosis in cancer cells. Although p53 has been reported to be a target of Sirt1, genetic p53 knockdowns showed that the Sirt1-dependent proapoptotic effect of Salermide is p53-independent. We were finally able to ascribe the apoptotic effect of Salermide to the reactivation of proapoptotic genes epigenetically repressed exclusively in cancer cells by Sirt1. Taken together, our results underline Salermide's promise as an anticancer drug and provide evidence for the molecular mechanism through which Sirt1 is involved in human tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2074966513,"In animal cells, cytokinesis is powered by a contractile ring of actin filaments (F-actin) and myosin-2. Formation of the contractile ring is dependent on the small GTPase RhoA, which is activated in a precise zone at the cell equator. It has long been assumed that cytokinesis and other Rho-dependent processes are controlled in a sequential manner, whereby Rho activation by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) initiates a particular event, and Rho inactivation by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) terminates that event. MgcRacGAP is a conserved cytokinesis regulator thought to be required only at the end of cytokinesis. Here we show that GAP activity of MgcRacGAP is necessary early during cytokinesis for the formation and maintenance of the Rho activity zone. Disruption of GAP activity by point mutation results in poorly focused Rho activity zones, whereas complete removal of the GAP domain results in unfocused zones that show lateral instability and/or rapid side-to-side oscillations. We propose that the GAP domain of MgcRacGAP has two unexpected roles throughout cytokinesis: first, it transiently anchors active Rho, and second, it promotes local Rho inactivation, resulting in the constant flux of Rho through the GTPase cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2037383561,"Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli is the most common cause of diarrhoea in developing countries and is the principal cause of traveller's diarrhoea. Adhesion to host cells is essential for the virulence of this and many other bacterial pathogens. A new adhesion mechanism has been identified in E. coli that relies on the secreted protein EtpA. The protein interacts with conserved regions of flagellin molecules at the tips of the bacterial flagella where it forms an adhesive molecular bridge between the bacterium and the host cell. This finding adds to the evidence that EtpA — and the conserved flagellin ligands —could be viable antigenic targets for vaccines against E. coli and other motile pathogens. Adhesion to host cells is essential for virulence of many bacterial pathogens, including pathogenic Escherichia coli. An adhesion mechanism that relies on the secreted protein EtpA is now presented. EtpA attaches to both the bacterial flagella tip and the host cell, providing an adherence mechanism that is important for E. coli pathogenesis and may be present in many other pathogens that possess EtpA homologues. Adhesion to epithelial cells1 and flagella-mediated motility are critical virulence traits for many Gram-negative pathogens, including enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC)2, a major cause of diarrhoea in travellers and children in developing countries3,4. Many flagellated pathogens export putative adhesins belonging to the two-partner secretion (TPS) family5. However, the actual function of these adhesins remains largely undefined. Here we demonstrate that EtpA, a TPS exoprotein adhesin of enterotoxigenic E. coli6, mimics and interacts with highly conserved regions of flagellin, the major subunit of flagella, and that these interactions are critical for adherence and intestinal colonization. Although conserved regions of flagellin are mostly buried in the flagellar shaft7, our results suggest that they are at least transiently exposed at the tips of flagella where they capture EtpA adhesin molecules for presentation to eukaryotic receptors. Similarity of EtpA to molecules encoded by other motile pathogens suggests a potential common pattern for bacterial adhesion, whereas participation of conserved regions of flagellin in adherence has implications for development of vaccines for Gram-negative pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2004740803,"The central catalyst in eukaryotic ATP-dependent homologous recombination consists of RAD51 proteins, polymerized around single-stranded DNA. This nucleoprotein filament recognizes and invades a homologous duplex DNA segment. After strand exchange, the nucleoprotein filament should disassemble so that the recombination process can be completed. The molecular mechanism of RAD51 filament disassembly is poorly understood. Here we show, by combining optical tweezers with single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and microfluidics, that disassembly of human RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments results from the interplay between ATP hydrolysis and the release of the tension stored in the filament. By applying external tension to the DNA, we found that disassembly slows down and can even be stalled. We quantified the fluorescence of RAD51 patches and found that disassembly occurs in bursts interspersed by long pauses. After relaxation of a stalled complex, pauses were suppressed resulting in a large burst. These results indicate that tension-dependent disassembly takes place only from filament ends, after tension-independent ATP hydrolysis. This integrative single-molecule approach allowed us to dissect the mechanism of this principal homologous recombination reaction step, which in turn clarifies how disassembly can be influenced by accessory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2025445118,"PrP(Sc), a misfolded and aggregated form of the cellular prion protein PrP(C), is the only defined constituent of the transmissible agent causing prion diseases. Expression of PrP(C) in the host organism is necessary for prion replication and for prion neurotoxicity. Understanding prion diseases necessitates detailed structural insights into PrP(C) and PrP(Sc). Towards this goal, we have developed a comprehensive collection of monoclonal antibodies denoted POM1 to POM19 and directed against many different epitopes of mouse PrP(C). Three epitopes are located within the N-terminal octarepeat region, one is situated within the central unstructured region, and four epitopes are discontinuous within the globular C-proximal domain of PrP(C). Some of these antibodies recognize epitopes that are resilient to protease digestion in PrP(Sc). Other antibodies immunoprecipitate PrP(C), but not PrP(Sc). A third group was found to immunoprecipitate both PrP isoforms. Some of the latter antibodies could be blocked with epitope-mimicking peptides, and incubation with an excess of these peptides allowed for immunochromatography of PrP(C) and PrP(Sc). Amino-proximal antibodies were found to react with repetitive PrP(C) epitopes, thereby vastly increasing their avidity. We have also created functional single-chain miniantibodies from selected POMs, which retained the binding characteristics despite their low molecular mass. The POM collection, thus, represents a unique set of reagents allowing for studies with a variety of techniques, including western blotting, ELISA, immunoprecipitation, conformation-dependent immunoassays, and plasmon surface plasmon resonance-based assays."

ABIN-1 deficient cells are hypersensitive to tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-induced programmed cell death, and TNF deficiency rescues ABIN-1 deficient embryos. ABIN-1 inhibits caspase 8 recruitment to FADD (Fas-associated death domain-containing protein) in TNF-induced signalling complexes, preventing caspase 8 cleavage and programmed cell death.

https://openalex.org/W1990340420,"Cellular lipid metabolism is regulated in part by protein-protein interactions near the surface of intracellular lipid droplets. This work investigated functional interactions between Abhd5, a protein activator of the lipase Atgl, and Mldp, a lipid droplet scaffold protein that is highly expressed in oxidative tissues. Abhd5 was highly targeted to individual lipid droplets containing Mldp in microdissected cardiac muscle fibers. Mldp bound Abhd5 in transfected fibroblasts and directed it to lipid droplets in proportion to Mldp concentration. Analysis of protein-protein interactions in situ demonstrated that the interaction of Abhd5 and Mldp occurs mainly, if not exclusively, on the surface of lipid droplets. Oleic acid treatment rapidly increased the interaction between Abhd5 and Mldp, and this effect was suppressed by pharmacological inhibition of triglyceride synthesis. The functional role of the Abhd5-Mldp interaction was explored using a mutant of mouse Abhd5 (E262K) that has greatly reduced binding to Mldp. Mldp promoted the subcellular colocalization and interaction of Atgl with wild type, but not mutant, Abhd5. This differential interaction was reflected in cellular assays of Atgl activity. In the absence of Mldp, wild type and mutant Abhd5 were equally effective in reducing lipid droplet formation. In contrast, mutant Abhd5 was unable to prevent lipid droplet accumulation in cells expressing Mldp despite considerable targeting of Atgl to lipid droplets containing Mldp. These results indicate that the interaction between Abhd5 and Mldp is dynamic and essential for regulating the activity of Atgl at lipid droplets containing Mldp."

This disease threatens over 350 million people in 88 countries in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions (4Kamhawi S.

The development, multiplication, and transmission of Leishmania in the form of promastigotes between mammalian hosts are achieved by the sandfly insect vector (4Kamhawi S. Trends Parasitol. 2006; 22: 439-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Following inoculation into a vertebrate host, promastigotes are typically phagocytosed by macrophages where they differentiate into and multiply as amastigotes (1Cunningham A.C. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2002; 72: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 5Hepburn N.C. Clin. Exp. Dermatol. 2000; 25: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Heavily infected macrophages lyse and liberate amastigotes that will colonize other cells. In addition, both promastigotes and amastigotes of Leishmania major can be internalized by fibroblast cells (6Bogdan C. Donhauser N. Doring R. Rollinghoff M. Diefenbach A. Rittig M.G. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 2121-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Despite their capability to synthesize nitric oxide, fibroblasts produce a much lower quantity of this microbicidal compound than macrophages (6Bogdan C. Donhauser N. Doring R. Rollinghoff M. Diefenbach A. Rittig M.G. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 2121-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The limited capacity of fibroblast to eliminate parasites implies that these cells could act as a reservoir for long term infection (6Bogdan C. Donhauser N. Doring R. Rollinghoff M. Diefenbach A. Rittig M.G. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 2121-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, little is known regarding the molecular events occurring in fibroblast cells upon contact with Leishmania parasites. Several intracellular parasites hijack the actin cytoskeletal machinery to infiltrate and traffic inside their host cells (7Stevens J.M. Galyov E.E. Stevens M.P. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 8Rottner K. Lommel S. Wehland J. Stradal T.E. J. Pathol. 2004; 204: 396-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).

Leishmania amastigotes induce activation of Cdc42 to re-organize the actin network and enter into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) fibroblasts (13Morehead J. Coppens I. Andrews N.W. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4571-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Additionally, the activity of Cdc42 is involved in knitting a shell of actin around the internalized Leishmania parasite, a site at which other cytoskeletal regulators such as vinculin and WASP are also recruited (13Morehead J. Coppens I. Andrews N.W. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4571-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 14Lodge R. Descoteaux A. Cell Microbiol. 2005; 7: 1647-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Numerous biological processes, including those modulating the dynamics of actin cytoskeleton assembly, are controlled by the dual effects of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Leishmania can affect the state of tyrosine phosphorylation in macrophage cells by activating SHP-1 (Src homology-2 domain-containing phosphatase-1) (15Blanchette J. Racette N. Faure R. Siminovitch K.A. Olivier M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3737-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Nandan D. Yi T. Lopez M. Lai C. Reiner N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50190-50197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, the specific roles of other PTPs in this pathogenic process remain unclear. Interestingly, another nonreceptor PTP, PTP-PEST, has been extensively implicated in the regulation of WASP and p130Cas phosphorylation as well as in the modulation of vinculin-containing adhesion structure formation (17Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 18Garton A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1019-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). These studies have established PTP-PEST as a critical regulator of actin remodeling and present this enzyme as a particularly interesting candidate target of Leishmania. Downstream elements of cellular signal transduction such as members of the MAPKs have also been linked to the pathogenic outcome of Leishmania infection. The ability of promastigotes to manipulate and circumvent MAPK activation may represent a strategy to evade the macrophage-host cell defense mechanism. Incubation of macrophages with a p38 inhibitor prior to exposure to Leishmania donovani augmented their subsequent invasion by the parasite (21Junghae M. Raynes J.G. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5026-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Similarly, the anisomycin-mediated inhibition of L. donovani survival inside macrophages was dependent on p38 (21Junghae M. Raynes J.G. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5026-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Moreover, L. major down-regulates p38 to impair CD40-induced iNOS2 expression, inhibiting nitric oxide production and favoring survival within macrophages (22Awasthi A. Mathur R. Khan A. Joshi B.N. Jain N. Sawant S. Boppana R. Mitra D. Saha B. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). By inhibiting p38, the parasite can also hijack another signal initiated by CD40 cross-linking, altering cytokine expression to its advantage; interleukin-12, a promoter of the host-protective T-helper type 1 (TH1) cell response, is reduced whereas interleukin-10, an inhibitor of TH1 cell and of NO production, is increased (23Mathur R.K. Awasthi A. Wadhone P. Ramanamurthy B. Saha B. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 24Kima P.E. Int. J. Parasitol. 2007; 37: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although the interplay between p38 activity and Leishmania persistence is accepted, little is known regarding the parasitic elements involved in regulation of this MAPK. Leishmania is coated by a characteristic glycocalyx, whose molecular components play a critical role in the initial contact between the parasite and its host environment. GP63, also referred to as major surface protease, leishmanolysin, or promastigote surface protease, is the most abundant protein covering Leishmania promastigotes (25Yao C. Donelson J.E. Wilson M.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 132: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 26Bouvier J. Etges R.J. Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15504-15509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies performed using different parasitic models demonstrated that GP63 plays a crucial role in complement fixation and processing, which protects Leishmania during its sojourn into mammalian hosts (27Joshi P.B. Sacks D.L. Modi G. McMaster W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 28Joshi P.B. Kelly B.L. Kamhawi S. Sacks D.L. McMaster W.R. Mol. Biochem.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 3102-3111PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, GP63 was recently shown to defend the parasite against antimicrobial peptides such as defensins and pexiganan (30Kulkarni M.M. McMaster W.R. Kamysz E. Kamysz W. Engman D.M. McGwire B.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 1484-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The abundance and diversity as well as the high catalytic activity at mammalian body temperature of this virulence factor (31Chaudhuri G. Chang K.P. Mol. Biochem.

Chang K.P. Engman D.M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Several species of Leishmania release proteolytically active GP63 in the surrounding milieu (35Yao C. Donelson J.E. Wilson M.E. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 1905-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 36Ellis M. Sharma D.K. Hilley J.D. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. J. Biol.

Res. 2003; 91: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) presumably facilitating the propagation of the parasite. In addition, fragments from GP63-processed fibronectin can protect parasites within macrophages, as they attenuate production of reactive oxygen intermediates and favor amastigote proliferation (39Kulkarni M.M. Jones E.A. McMaster W.R. McGwire B.S. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GP63 maximizes promastigote binding to and internalization in macrophages through its ability to interact with the α4/β1 integrin and to promote complement-dependent adhesion (40Brittingham A. Chen G. McGwire B.S. Chang K.P. Mosser D.M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Chen D.Q. Kolli B.K. Yadava N. Lu H.G. Gilman-Sachs A. Peterson D.A. Chang K.P. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Moreover, similar to fibronectin, coating polystyrene surfaces with GP63 enhances in vitro spreading of fibroblasts (42Rizvi F.S. Ouaissi M.A. Marty B. Santoro F. Capron A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 473-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The expression of specific gp63 genes in the intracellular amastigote form (27Joshi P.B. Sacks D.L. Modi G. McMaster W.R. Mol.

Parasitol. 2008; 157: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) implies an intra-host cell function for this parasitic protease. Interestingly, the activity of GP63 was implicated in the protection of encapsulated proteins against phagolysosomal degradation as well as intra-macrophage survival of Leishmania mexicana amazonensis (45Chaudhuri G. Chaudhuri M. Pan A. Chang K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7483-7489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Seay M.B. Heard P.L. Chaudhuri G. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 5129-5137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate-related protein (MRP), a cytosolic protein associated with the actin network of macrophages, as a substrate of GP63 reinforces the potential of this enzyme to modulate host cell activities within the intracellular space (47Corradin S. Ransijn A. Corradin G. Roggero M.A. Schmitz A.A. Schneider P. Mauel J. Vergeres G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25411-25418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, little else is known concerning its impact on host cell signal transduction or the existence of additional intracellular substrates for this parasitic protease. Subverting normal cellular functions is a widespread strategy among intracellular parasites to take advantage of mammalian hosts. In this study, we describe distinctive effects of Leishmania infection on cell signaling in fibroblasts. During L. major infection, we found that the parasite manipulates cellular components, in part by altering the tyrosine phosphorylation state of several proteins. Upon contact with L. major, the adaptor Crk interacts with a truncated form of p130Cas, which further correlates with cleavage of two novel substrates, p130Cas and PTP-PEST, by GP63. Moreover, through GP63, L. major impacted the stability of additional proteins, including cortactin, TC-PTP (T-cell PTP), and caspase-3. Additionally, L. major was found to down-regulate p38 in a GP63-dependent manner. Direct activators of p38 include the MAPK kinase MKK3, MKK6, and the adaptor molecule TAB1 (TAK-1-binding protein-1), which interacts directly with p38 (48Zarubin T. Han J. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar, 49Ge B. Gram H. Di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the inhibition of p38 occurred in concert with the GP63-mediated proteolysis of TAB1. This study reveals diverse and novel mechanisms by which Leishmania can monopolize different constituents of the fibroblast signal transduction machinery. Reagents, Antibodies, and Plasmids-Chemicals were purchased at BioShop Canada Inc., Fisher, and Sigma. The PTP-PEST polyclonal antibodies (2528 and 2530) were described previously (19Côté J.F.

Monoclonal antibodies specific for Crk, p130Cas, integrin-β1, Shc, and paxillin were from BD Transduction Laboratories. Antibodies against IκBα, STAT5 (C17), and JNK1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. TC-PTP monoclonal antibodies (3E2) were described previously (50Ibarra-Sanchez M.J. Wagner J. Ong M.T. Lampron C. Tremblay M.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4728-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against PTP-1B and focal adhesion kinase as well as monoclonal anti-cortactin (4F11) and phosphotyrosine (4G10) were from Upstate. Antibodies specific for AKT, caspase-3, phospho-Thr-202/Tyr-204 p44/42 MAPKs, p44/42 MAPKs, phospho-Thr-183/Tyr-185 JNK, phospho-Thr-180/Tyr-182 p38 MAPK, p38 MAPK, TAB1, MKK3, and MKK6 were from Cell Signaling Technology. The vector encoding GST-PTP-PEST (pEBG-PTP-PEST) has been described (51Hallé M. Liu Y.C. Hardy S. Théberge J.F. Blanchetot C. Bourdeau A. Meng T.C. Tremblay M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1172-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding p38 (image ID 4195842) and TAB1 (image ID 5356886) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). pET-28(c+)TAB1 was generated by PCR cloning of the TAB1 cDNA between the EcoRI and NotI sites. FLAG-TAB1-Myc-Myc WT and residues 1–418 (amino acid numbering) were made by inserting TAB1 cDNA amplified by PCR into pcDNA4/Myc-HisA between the EcoRI and NotI restriction sites. The sense oligonucleotide sequence contains the FLAG epitope, whereas the antisense oligonucleotides for both full-length and truncated TAB1 encodes an additional Myc epitope. The mammalian expression vector encoding GST-p38 was obtained by successively cloning the p38 PCR product into pDONR221 and pDEST27 using Gateway technology according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). The integrity of the inserted DNA in each vector was verified by sequencing (Genome Quebec). Cells and Parasites-Transient transfections were performed, and PTP-PEST clones (B14V, B15V, B11WT (wild type), and B118WT) were generated and maintained as described previously (51Hallé M. Liu Y.C. Hardy S. Théberge J.F. Blanchetot C. Bourdeau A. Meng T.C. Tremblay M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1172-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (P-MEFs) were isolated from BALB/c embryos (The Jackson Laboratories) and grown as described (51Hallé M. Liu Y.C. Hardy S. Théberge J.F. Blanchetot C. Bourdeau A. Meng T.C. Tremblay M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1172-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). L. major A2 and gp63-null (L. majorgp63-/-) and rescued strains (in which gp63 gene 1 was re-introduced, L. majorgp63-/-rescued) (28Joshi P.B. Kelly B.L. Kamhawi S. Sacks D.L. McMaster W.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) as well as L. donovani strain 2211, L. mexicana, Leishmania tarentolae, and Leishmania braziliensis 2249 promastigotes were all maintained at 25 °C in SDM-79 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Wisent) as described (52Gregory D.J. Godbout M. Contreras I. Forget G. Olivier M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2008; 38: 1071-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cellular Treatment, Infection, and Immunoblotting-Stationary phase of Leishmania promastigotes was centrifuged at 2500 rpm (Allegra 6R Centrifuge, Beckman Coulter) for 5 min. Supernatant was removed, and pellets of parasites were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 min (Allegra 6R Centrifuge, Beckman Coulter). Parasites were resuspended in DMEM (containing the indicated concentration of heat-inactivated FBS) and added onto cells at the specified parasite:cell ratio and for the indicated duration. Cells were then rinsed on ice with PBS and lysed (100 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)). Cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration of each sample was measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad protein assay). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore), and immunoblotted as described (51Hallé M. Liu Y.C. Hardy S. Théberge J.F. Blanchetot C. Bourdeau A. Meng T.C. Tremblay M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1172-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The effect of pharmacological protease inhibitors on cellular protein degradation induced by L. major infection was determined as follows: caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-fmk; Cedarlane), calpain inhibitor (PD150606; Calbiochem), proteasome inhibitor (lactacystin; Sigma), as well as calpain inhibitor and proteasome inhibitor combined together were added to cells 2 h prior to addition of parasites and co-incubated for an additional 15 min. Cells that were not exposed to any of the inhibitors were incubated with media containing DMSO as a vehicle control. Cells were harvested, lysed, and analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. The effect on mammalian cells of parasite-conditioned medium and protein lysates prepared from cultured L. major was evaluated as follows. L. major cultures were centrifuged for 5 min at 2500 rpm (Allegra 6R Centrifuge, Beckman Coulter). Supernatants were carefully harvested, avoiding contact with the pellet and the wall of the tube. Conditioned SDM was centrifuged a second time for 10 min at 3500 rpm (Allegra 6R Centrifuge, Beckman Coulter) to remove any potentially residual parasites. Supernatant from cultured parasites was then diluted in normal parasite growth media to normalize the volume according to the parasite concentration in the original culture. Conditioned or fresh growth media were deposited on P-MEFs for 1 h, and cell lysates were prepared and analyzed as described above. To prepare parasite lysates, L. major parasites were washed three times with PBS, resuspended in serum-free DMEM, and sonicated (Ultrasonic Processor, Sonics & Materials Inc.) two times for 10 s at an intensity of 50% at 4 °C with a 30-s incubation on ice between sonication steps. Lysates were then cleared by centrifugation for 2 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C, and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay. P-MEFs were then incubated with serum-free DMEM supplemented with 333 μg/ml L. major protein extract for 1 h. The absence of parasites in both the conditioned media and L. major lysates was confirmed by microscopic examination (data not shown). Following the incubation, protein lysates were prepared from treated cells and analyzed by immunoblotting according to the procedures described above. Incubation of Cellular Extracts and Recombinant Proteins with Parasite Lysate-The procedure for preparation of parasite extracts from L. major promastigotes (WT and gp63-/-) was based on a previously published protocol (47Corradin S. Ransijn A. Corradin G. Roggero M.A. Schmitz A.A. Schneider P. Mauel J. Vergeres G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25411-25418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). L. major stationary phase promastigotes were washed with PBS and with TNB (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Invitrogen), 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) before being resuspended in TNB. Parasites were then sonicated (Ultrasonic Processor, Sonics & Materials Inc.) two times at 4 °C for 5 s at an intensity of 50% with a 5-s incubation on ice between each sonication step. Samples were then centrifuged for 2 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C, and supernatants were kept to perform the cleavage assay. PTP-PEST-/--WT expressing cells (clone B11WT) were rinsed with ice-cold PBS, collected in TNB, and lysed by three sonication steps of 15 s at an intensity of 50% at 4 °C, which were separated by 15-s incubations on ice. Samples were then centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C; supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay. Next, 200 μg of protein lysates from PTP-PEST-/--WT expressing cells was incubated with lysates made from 20 × 106 promastigotes (either from WT or gp63-/- L. major) or with TNB (control) at 37 °C for the indicated time. Samples were immediately placed on ice, and SDS sample buffer was added. Samples were boiled for 4 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting. To obtain purified GST-PTP-PEST, protein extracts from transfected fibroblasts (51Hallé M. Liu Y.C. Hardy S. Théberge J.F. Blanchetot C. Bourdeau A. Meng T.C. Tremblay M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1172-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were prepared in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C and then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer and two times with TNB. Next, the beads were resuspended in TNB, incubated with the indicated quantity of L. major lysates, and prepared as described above for 15 min at 37 °C. Samples were immediately placed on ice, rinsed twice with ice-cold lysis buffer, and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 4 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Incubation of Recombinant Proteins with Recombinant GP63-GST-PTP-PEST was purified as described above. To produce His-TAB1, Escherichia coli cells transformed with pET-28(c+)TAB1 were induced for 2 h at 37 °C with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside and harvested by centrifugation. Bacterial cells were lysed (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 40 mm imidazole, 1% Triton X-100, and EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor), and recombinant proteins were isolated on nickel-Sepharose beads (Ni-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow, GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

https://openalex.org/W1971796809,"Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is located at 20q13, a region that is frequently amplified in gastric cancer. In this study, we have investigated the role of AURKA in regulating glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta and beta-catenin/TCF complex in gastric cancer cells. Our results demonstrate a significant increase in the phosphorylation of GSK-3beta at Ser 9 following the overexpression of AURKA in AGS cells. The immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific for AURKA and GSK-3beta indicated that the two proteins coexist in the same protein complex. The recombinant human AURKA protein phosphorylated the GSK-3beta protein at Ser 9 in a concentration-dependent manner, in vitro. The phosphorylation of beta-catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41) by GSK-3beta is known to target beta-catenin towards degradation. In line with our findings, the increase in phospho-GSK-3beta level was accompanied by a significant decrease in beta-catenin phosphorylation (Ser33/37/Thr41) and accumulation of beta-catenin protein. The knockdown of AURKA reversed the phosphorylation of GSK-3beta and the beta-catenin protein levels. The immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated colocalization of AURKA and GSK-3beta proteins and a significant increase in the nuclear beta-catenin levels in cells overexpressing AURKA. The beta-catenin/TCF transcription activity was measured using the pTopFlash and its mutant pFopFlash luciferase reporter vectors. Indeed, AURKA overexpression led to a significant increase in the pTopFlash reporter activity, whereas kinase dead AURKA mutant (D274A) had no effect. Consistent with these findings, we detected a significant mRNA up-regulation of several direct targets of the beta-catenin/TCF transcription complex (cyclin D1, c-MYC, c-MYC-binding protein, CLDN1, FGF18 and vascular endothelial growth factor), and a two-fold increase in the proliferation rate in AURKA overexpressing cells. We conclude that the AURKA/GSK-3beta interaction is important in regulating beta-catenin, underscoring a novel oncogenic potential for AURKA in gastric tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2014187813,"Ezrin is a member of the ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) protein family and links F-actin to the cell membrane following phosphorylation. Ezrin has been associated with tumor progression and metastasis in several cancers including the pediatric solid tumors, osteosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. In this study, we were surprised to find that ezrin was not constitutively phosphorylated but rather was dynamically regulated during metastatic progression in osteosarcoma. Metastatic osteosarcoma cells expressed phosphorylated ERM early after their arrival in the lung, and then late in progression, only at the invasive front of larger metastatic lesions. To pursue mechanisms for this regulation, we found that inhibitors of PKC (protein kinase C) blocked phosphorylation of ezrin, and that ezrin coimmunoprecipitated in cells with PKCα, PKCι and PKCγ. Furthermore, phosphorylated forms of ezrin and PKC had identical expression patterns at the invasive front of pulmonary metastatic lesions in murine and human patient samples. Finally, we showed that the promigratory effects of PKC were linked to ezrin phosphorylation. These data are the first to suggest a dynamic regulation of ezrin phosphorylation during metastasis and to connect the PKC family members with this regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1984152805,"Recent reports implicate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) in the activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). We investigated the role of PARP-1 in the NF-kappaB signalling cascade induced by ionizing radiation (IR). AG14361, a potent PARP-1 inhibitor, was used in two breast cancer cell lines expressing different levels of constitutively activated NF-kappaB, as well as mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) proficient or deficient for PARP-1 or NF-kappaB p65. In the breast cancer cell lines, AG14361 had no effect on IR-induced degradation of IkappaBalpha or nuclear translocation of p50 or p65. However, AG14361 inhibited IR-induced NF-kappaB-dependent transcription of a luciferase reporter gene. Similarly, in PARP-1(-/-) MEFs, IR-induced nuclear translocation of p50 and p65 was normal, but kappaB binding and transcriptional activation did not occur. AG14361 sensitized both breast cancer cell lines to IR-induced cell killing, inhibited IR-induced XIAP expression and increased caspase-3 activity. However, AG14361 failed to increase IR-induced caspase activity when p65 was knocked down by siRNA. Consistent with this, AG14361 sensitized p65(+/+) but not p65(-/-) MEFs to IR. We conclude that PARP-1 activity is essential in the upstream regulation of IR-induced NF-kappaB activation. These data indicate that potentiation of IR-induced cytotoxicity by AG14361 is mediated solely by inhibition of NF-kappaB activation."
https://openalex.org/W2049812368,"Telomeres are essential for maintaining cellular proliferative capacity and their loss has been implicated in ageing. A key regulator in telomere maintenance is the telomeric protein TRF1, which was also identified as Pin2 in a screen for Pin1. Pin1 is a unique prolyl isomerase that regulates protein conformation and function after phosphorylation. However, little is known about the role of Pin1 in telomere regulation or the modulation of TRF1 by upstream signals. Here we identify TRF1 as a major conserved substrate for Pin1 during telomere maintenance and ageing. Pin1 inhibition renders TRF1 resistant to protein degradation, enhances TRF1 binding to telomeres, and leads to gradual telomere loss in human cells and in mice. Pin1-deficient mice also show widespread premature ageing phenotypes within just one generation, similar to those in telomerase-deficient mice after 4-5 consecutive generations. Thus, Pin1 is an essential regulator of TRF1 stability, telomere maintenance and ageing."
https://openalex.org/W2062367951,"Maladaptive, Th2-polarized inflammatory responses are integral to the pathogenesis of allergic asthma. As regulators of T cell activation, dendritic cells (DCs) are important mediators of allergic asthma, yet the precise signals which render endogenous DCs “pro-asthmatic”, and the extent to which these signals are regulated by the pulmonary environment and host genetics, remains unclear. Comparative phenotypic and functional analysis of pulmonary DC populations in mice susceptible (A/J), or resistant (C3H) to experimental asthma, revealed that susceptibility to airway hyperresponsiveness is associated with preferential myeloid DC (mDC) allergen uptake, and production of Th17-skewing cytokines (IL-6, IL-23), whereas resistance is associated with increased allergen uptake by plasmacytoid DCs. Surprisingly, adoptive transfer of syngeneic HDM-pulsed bone marrow derived mDCs (BMDCs) to the lungs of C3H mice markedly enhanced lung IL-17A production, and rendered them susceptible to allergen-driven airway hyperresponsiveness. Characterization of these BMDCs revealed levels of antigen uptake, and Th17 promoting cytokine production similar to that observed in pulmonary mDCs from susceptible A/J mice. Collectively these data demonstrate that the lung environment present in asthma-resistant mice promotes robust pDC allergen uptake, activation, and limits Th17-skewing cytokine production responsible for driving pathologic T cell responses central to the development of allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2055397488,"Tiling describes the arrangement of neuronal processes in a pattern with little or no overlap with those of neighboring neurons. It is unclear how this is mediated in the vertebrate retina, whose mosaic cell body distribution of horizontal cells is accompanied by extensively overlapping dendrites. A study by Huckfeldt et al. now shows that the nonrandom distribution of the horizontal cells is correlated with repulsive homotypic interactions between developmentally transient processes, leading to the development of initial territories of horizontal cell. Sensory neurons with common functions are often nonrandomly arranged and form dendritic territories that show little overlap, or tiling. Repulsive homotypic interactions underlie such patterns in cell organization in invertebrate neurons. It is unclear how dendro-dendritic repulsive interactions can produce a nonrandom distribution of cells and their spatial territories in mammalian retinal horizontal cells, as mature horizontal cell dendrites overlap substantially. By imaging developing mouse horizontal cells, we found that these cells transiently elaborate vertical neurites that form nonoverlapping columnar territories on reaching their final laminar positions. Targeted cell ablation revealed that the vertical neurites engage in homotypic interactions that result in tiling of neighboring cells before the establishment of their dendritic fields. This developmental tiling of transient neurites correlates with the emergence of a nonrandom distribution of the cells and could represent a mechanism that organizes neighbor relationships and territories of neurons before circuit assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2029841674,"The secreted trefoil factor family 2 (TFF2) protein contributes to the protection of the gastrointestinal mucosa from injury by strengthening and stabilizing mucin gels, stimulating epithelial restitution, and restraining the associated inflammation. Although trefoil factors have been shown to activate signaling pathways, no cell surface receptor has been directly linked to trefoil peptide signaling. Here we demonstrate the ability of TFF2 peptide to activate signaling via the CXCR4 chemokine receptor in cancer cell lines. We found that both mouse and human TFF2 proteins (at approximately 0.5 microm) activate Ca2+ signaling in lymphoblastic Jurkat cells that could be abrogated by receptor desensitization (with SDF-1alpha) or pretreatment with the specific antagonist AMD3100 or an anti-CXCR4 antibody. TFF2 pretreatment of Jurkat cells decreased Ca2+ rise and chemotactic response to SDF-1alpha. In addition, the CXCR4-negative gastric epithelial cell line AGS became highly responsive to TFF2 treatment upon expression of the CXCR4 receptor. TFF2-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases in gastric and pancreatic cancer cells, KATO III and AsPC-1, respectively, was also dependent on the presence of the CXCR4 receptor. Finally we demonstrate a distinct proliferative effect of TFF2 protein on an AGS gastric cancer cell line that expresses CXCR4. Overall these data identify CXCR4 as a bona fide signaling receptor for TFF2 and suggest a mechanism through which TFF2 may modulate immune and tumorigenic responses in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2022772040,"Despite being the agent of life-threatening meningitis, Neisseria meningitidis is usually carried asymptomatically in the nasopharynx of humans and only occasionally causes disease. The genetic bases for virulence have not been entirely elucidated and the search for new virulence factors in this species is hampered by the lack of an animal model representative of the human disease. As an alternative strategy we employ a molecular epidemiological approach to establish a statistical association of a candidate virulence gene with disease in the human population. We examine the distribution of a previously-identified genetic element, a temperate bacteriophage, in 1288 meningococci isolated from cases of disease and asymptomatic carriage. The phage was over-represented in disease isolates from young adults indicating that it may contribute to invasive disease in this age group. Further statistical analysis indicated that between 20% and 45% of the pathogenic potential of the five most common disease-causing meningococcal groups was linked to the presence of the phage. In the absence of an animal model of human disease, this molecular epidemiological approach permitted the estimation of the influence of the candidate virulence factor. Such an approach is particularly valuable in the investigation of exclusively human diseases."

While research has been carried out on bullying experienced by psychiatrists and psychiatry trainees in Pakistan no such research has been conducted on medical students in this country. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire survey on final year medical students in six medical colleges of Pakistan. The response rate was 63%. Fifty-two percent of respondents reported that they had faced bullying or harassment during their medical education, about 28% of them experiencing it once a month or even more frequently. The overwhelming form of bullying had been verbal abuse (57%), while consultants were the most frequent (46%) perpetrators. Students who were slightly older, males, those who reported that their medical college did not have a policy on bullying or harassment, and those who felt that adequate support was not in place at their medical college for bullied individuals, were significantly more likely to have experienced bullying. Conclusion Bullying or harassment is faced by quite a large proportion of medical students in Pakistan. The most frequent perpetrators of this bullying are consultants. Adoption of a policy against bullying and harassment by medical colleges, and providing avenues of support for students who have been bullied may help reduce this phenomenon, as the presence of these two was associated with decreased likelihood of students reporting having being bullied."
https://openalex.org/W2066759161,"XB130 is a recently cloned 130 kDa-adaptor protein and Src kinase substrate, structurally similar to actin-filament-associated protein. Here we show that XB130 is predominantly expressed in the thyroid. Given that XB130 is a thyroid-specific tyrosine kinase substrate, we asked whether it is targeted by RET/PTC, a genetically rearranged, constitutively active, thyroid-specific tyrosine kinase that plays a pathogenic role in papillary thyroid cancer. RET/PTC induced robust tyrosine phosphorylation of XB130, which promoted its subsequent association with the p85α subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). We identified tyrosine 54 of XB130 as the major target of RET/PTC-mediated phosphorylation and a critical binding site for the SH2 domains of p85α. Importantly, downregulation of XB130 in TPC1 papillary thyroid cancer cells, harboring the RET/PTC1 kinase, strongly reduced Akt activity without altering ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and concomitantly inhibited cell-cycle progression and survival in suspension. In conclusion, XB130 is a novel substrate of the RET/PTC kinase that links RET/PTC signaling to PI 3-kinase activation, and thereby plays an important role in sustaining proliferation and survival of thyroid tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2010047684,"The p53 tumor suppressor serves as a crucial barrier against cancer development. In tumor cells and their progenitors, p53 suppresses cancer in a cell-autonomous manner. However, p53 also possesses non-cell-autonomous activities. For example, p53 of stromal fibroblasts can modulate the spectrum of proteins secreted by these cells, rendering their microenvironment less supportive of the survival and spread of adjacent tumor cells. We now report that epithelial tumor cells can suppress p53 induction in neighboring fibroblasts, an effect reproducible by tumor cell-conditioned medium. The ability to suppress fibroblast p53 activation is acquired by epithelial cells in the course of neoplastic transformation. Specifically, stable transduction of immortalized epithelial cells by mutant H-Ras and p53-specific short inhibitory RNA endows them with the ability to quench fibroblast p53 induction. Importantly, human cancer-associated fibroblasts are more susceptible to this suppression than normal fibroblasts. These findings underscore a mechanism whereby epithelial cancer cells may overcome the non-cell-autonomous tumor suppressor function of p53 in stromal fibroblasts."

https://openalex.org/W2110540970,"Circadian ( approximately 24 hr) rhythms are generated by the central pacemaker localized to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Although the basis for intrinsic rhythmicity is generally understood to rely on transcription factors encoded by ""clock genes"", less is known about the daily regulation of SCN neuronal activity patterns that communicate a circadian time signal to downstream behaviors and physiological systems. Action potentials in the SCN are necessary for the circadian timing of behavior, and individual SCN neurons modulate their spontaneous firing rate (SFR) over the daily cycle, suggesting that the circadian patterning of neuronal activity is necessary for normal behavioral rhythm expression. The BK K(+) channel plays an important role in suppressing spontaneous firing at night in SCN neurons. Deletion of the Kcnma1 gene, encoding the BK channel, causes degradation of circadian behavioral and physiological rhythms.To test the hypothesis that loss of robust behavioral rhythmicity in Kcnma1(-/-) mice is due to the disruption of SFR rhythms in the SCN, we used multi-electrode arrays to record extracellular action potentials from acute wild-type (WT) and Kcnma1(-/-) slices. Patterns of activity in the SCN were tracked simultaneously for up to 3 days, and the phase, period, and synchronization of SFR rhythms were examined. Loss of BK channels increased arrhythmicity but also altered the amplitude and period of rhythmic activity. Unexpectedly, Kcnma1(-/-) SCNs showed increased variability in the timing of the daily SFR peak.These results suggest that BK channels regulate multiple aspects of the circadian patterning of neuronal activity in the SCN. In addition, these data illustrate the characteristics of a disrupted SCN rhythm downstream of clock gene-mediated timekeeping and its relationship to behavioral rhythms."

We have observed that the tissue-specific loss of the integrin β1 subunit in striated muscle results in a near complete loss of integrin β1 subunit protein expression concomitant with a loss of talin and to a lesser extent, a reduction in F-actin content. Muscle-specific integrin β1-deficient mice had no significant difference in food intake, weight gain, fasting glucose, and insulin levels with their littermate controls. However, dynamic analysis of glucose homeostasis using euglycemichyperinsulinemic clamps demonstrated a 44 and 48% reduction of insulin-stimulated glucose infusion rate and glucose clearance, respectively. The whole body insulin resistance resulted from a specific inhibition of skeletal muscle glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis without any significant effect on the insulin suppression of hepatic glucose output or insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipose tissue. The reduction in skeletal muscle insulin responsiveness occurred without any change in GLUT4 protein expression levels but was associated with an impairment of the insulin-stimulated protein kinase B/Akt serine 473 phosphorylation but not threonine 308. The inhibition of insulin-stimulated serine 473 phosphorylation occurred concomitantly with a decrease in integrin-linked kinase expression but with no change in the mTOR·Rictor·LST8 complex (mTORC2).

Although studies described above have utilized a variety of tissue culture cell systems to address the potential involvement of integrin receptor signaling in insulin action, to date there has not been any investigation of integrin function on insulin action or glucose homeostasis in vivo. To address this issue, we have taken advantage of Cre-LoxP technology to inactivate the β1 integrin receptor subunit gene in striated muscle. We have observed that muscle creatine kinase-specific integrin β1 knock-out (MCKItgβ1 KO) mice display a reduction of insulin-stimulated glucose infusion rate and glucose clearance. The impairment of insulin-stimulated skeletal muscle glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis resulted from a decrease in Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation concomitant with a marked reduction in ILK expression.

All the mice strains used in this study were backcrossed 6-9 generations into the C57Bl6/J strain. Genotyping were performed by PCR using genomic DNA isolated from the tails of 3-4-week-old mice. The primers (5′-TGATGAGGTTCGCAAGAACC-3′ and 5′-CCATGAGTGAACGAACCTGG-3′) for identifying carriers of the Cre-recombinase transgenic were used under the following conditions: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by 1 cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. The primers for the floxed Itgβ1 genotyping (5′-AGGTGCCCTTCCCTCTAGA-3′ and 5′-GTGAAGTAGGTGAAAGGTAAC) were used under the following conditions: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 2 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by 1 cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. Mice were housed in a temperature-controlled environment with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and provided a standard chow diet with free access to food and water. Food intake and weights were determined daily, and all studies were performed on 14-week-old male mice. All animal protocols were performed in accordance with Stony Brook University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approval. Plasma Analysis and Immunoblotting—Fasting blood samples were collected by tail bleeding after a 14-h fast. Glucose was measured using a glucose oxidase method on a Beckman glucose analyzer 2 (Beckman Instruments Inc., Fullerton, CA). Insulin levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden). For acute insulin stimulation, the mice were fasted for 14 h and given an intraperitoneal injection with 1 unit/kg human recombinant insulin (Lilly). Ten minutes later the animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg), and tissue samples were collected and immediately frozen at -80 °C. Tissues isolated from both EU clamps and acute insulin stimulation were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 2 mm Na4P2O7) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). The resultant lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations were quantified using the BCA (bicinchoninic acid) protein assays (Pierce). The protein samples (30 μg) were separated on a 4-12% gradient SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semidry electroblotter (Owl Separation System, Portsmouth, NH). Membranes were immunoblotted with β1 integrin monoclonal antibody (BD Pharmingen), GLUT4 polyclonal antibody (East Acres Biologicals Inc.), phospho-Ser-473, and phospho-Thr-308 Akt monoclonal antibodies, pan-protein kinase B/Akt polyclonal antibody, phospho-Ser-9-GSK3β, total GSK3β, phospho-Thr-642-AS160, total AS160 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), ILK and talin monoclonal antibodies (Sigma), and α-dystroglycan antibody as previously described (36Kanagawa M.

Phospho-IRS1 and p110 association was determined by PY20 (BD Biosciences) and p110 (R&D Systems) immunoblotting of IRS1 immunoprecipitates (BD Biosciences). Quantification of all immunoblots was performed using NIH IMAGE software. In Vivo Assessment of Insulin Action and Glucose Metabolism—Four days before the experiment, the mice were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg), and an indwelling catheter was introduced in the left internal jugular vein. The catheters were externalized through an incision in the skin flap behind the head, and the mice were returned to individual cages after the surgery. The mice were fully recovered from the surgery before the in vivo experiments, as reflected by their reaching preoperative weight. After an overnight fast, EU clamps were conducted in conscious mice as previously described (37Kim J.K. Wi J.K. Youn J.H. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The 2-h EU clamp was conducted with a primecontinuous infusion of human insulin (2.5 milliunits/kg/min) and a variable infusion of 20% glucose to maintain glucose at ∼110 mg/dl. Insulin-stimulated whole body glucose metabolism was estimated using a prime continuous infusion of [3-3H]glucose (10 μCi bolus, 0.1 μCi/min; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To determine the rate of basal glucose turnover, [3-3H]glucose (0.05 μCi/min) was infused for 2 h (basal period) before starting the EU clamp, and a blood sample was taken at the end of this basal period. To assess insulin-stimulated tissue-specific glucose uptake, 2-deoxy-d-[1-14C]glucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was administered as a bolus (10 μCi) 75 min after the start of the clamp. Blood samples were taken at 80, 85, 90, 100, 110, and 120 min after the start of the EU clamp. To estimate basal muscle glucose uptake, 2-deoxy-d-[1-14C]glucose was infused with isotonic saline. All infusions were performed using microdialysis pumps (CMA/Microdialysis). At the end of the EU clamp, animals were euthanized with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg), and different muscle groups, adipose tissue, heart, and liver were rapidly dissected and frozen at -80 °C for analysis. During the clamp plasma glucose was monitored using 10 μl of plasma by glucose analyzer 2. For the determination of plasma [3-3H]glucose and 2-deoxy-d-[1-14C]glucose concentrations, plasma was deproteinized with ZnSO4 and Ba(OH)2, dried to remove 3H2O, resuspended in water, and counted in scintillation fluid (Ultima Gold; Packard Instrument Co.). The plasma concentration of 3H2O was determined by the difference between 3H counts without and with drying. For the determination of tissue 2-deoxy-d-[1-14C]glucose (2-DG)-6-phosphate (2-DG-6-P) content, tissue samples were homogenized, and the supernatants were subjected to an ion-exchange column to separate 2-DG-6-P from 2-DG, as described previously (38Ohshima K. Shargill N.S. Chan T.M. Bray G.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: E193-E197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The radioactivity of 3H in tissue glycogen was determined by digesting tissue samples in KOH and precipitating glycogen with ethanol as previously described (37Kim J.K. Wi J.K. Youn J.H. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Muscle glycogen synthesis was calculated as muscle [3H]glycogen content divided by the area under the plasma [3H]glucose-specific activity profile. Muscle glycolysis was estimated as the difference between muscle glucose uptake and muscle glycogen synthesis. Activity and Exercise Capacity—Spontaneous locomoter activity of control Itgβ1flox/flox and MCKItgβ1 KO mice was determined by quantifying the number of beam breaks in xy axis of an Oxymax open-circuit indirect calorimetry system (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). During the first 48 h of the experiment, animals were allowed free access to food and water. After 48 h, animals were still allowed free access to water, but they were not fed in the evening for 12 h (from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.) and then re-fed for 24 h (7 a.m. to 7 a.m.). At the end of the experiment, the animals underwent an 8-h fast (7 a.m. to 3 p.m.). The locomotor activity was monitored by the number of beam breaks and was averaged and expressed as counts/h. Running capacity was determined as described by Koch and Britton (39Koch L.G. Britton S.L. Physiol. Genomics. 2001; 5: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Briefly, the MCKItgβ1 KO and Itgβ1flox/flox mice were acclimatized to a treadmill (Columbus Instruments) by running at 10 m/min for 15 min over 3 consecutive days. On the fourth day, groups of mice were run at 10 m/min on a 0° grade or 10 m/min on a 15° grade incline. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—After an overnight fast (14 h), the mice were euthanized. The tissues were removed and embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound. The frozen tissue cross-sections (10 μm) were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 60 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: β1 integrin polyclonal antibody (1:100) and talin antibody (1:50). Fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies (1:100, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were added to the sections for 30 min at room temperature. Filamentous (F-) actin was visualized by incubation of the fixed tissue with phalloidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:1000) for 30 min. After extensive washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the slides were mounted with Vectashield Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories). The slides were observed with confocal fluorescent microscopy (model LSM510; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). Statistical Analysis—Results are represented as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using an unpaired two-tailed Student's t test, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Generation of Muscle-specific β1 Integrin Knock-out Mice—To investigate the selective function of the β1 integrin subunit on insulin action and glucose homeostasis, we generated a muscle-specific-deficient Itgβ1 mouse by crossing mice carrying a “floxed” allele of β1 integrin (Itgβ1) in which loxP sites were introduced flanking exon 2 of the entire mouse β1 integrin gene (40Nieswandt B. Brakebusch C. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Bouvard D. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Lindhout T. Heemskerk J.W. Zirngibl H. Fassler R.

Hayashi T. Horsch D. Accili D. Goodyear L.J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 559-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Breeding of Itgβ1flox/+ and MCK-Cre+/- mice resulted in double heterozygous animals that were then bred with Itgβ1flox/+ mice to obtain Itgβ1flox/flox:MCK-Cre offspring; that is, mice with a disruption of β1 integrin specifically in striated muscle (MCKItgβ1 KO). Offspring from these crosses resulted in the expected frequency of 12.5% for a trait requiring two independent loci, demonstrating the absence of embryonic lethality. To verify the extent of Itgβ1 recombination, we examined various tissues in two independent MCK-Cre-crossed mice by immunoblotting. These data demonstrated an almost complete loss of β1 integrin protein expression in skeletal and cardiac muscle with essentially wild type levels of protein expression in all the other tissues examined (Fig. 1). The p115 Golgi protein was used a protein loading control. General phenotypic characteristics of the MCKItgβ1 KO mice demonstrated that up to 14 weeks of age, there was no significant difference in overall body weight, food intake, fasting plasma glucose, and insulin concentrations compared with control Itgβ1flox/flox and wild type mice (Table 1).TABLE 1Physical parameters of MCKItgβ1 KO miceWild typeItgβp1flox/floxMCKItgβ1KOFood intake (g/day)3.19 ± 0.83.21 ± 0.63.16 ± 0.74Weight (g)23.8 ± 1.324.9 ± 1.522.7 ± 1.19Fasting glucose (mg/dl)118.6 ± 9.8112.6 ± 9.8105 ± 9.9Fasting insulin (milliunits/liter)12.95 ± 1.612.75 ± 1.113.08 ± 0.76 Open table in a new tab Loss of Integrin β1 Expression in Skeletal Muscle Is Associated with Reduced Expression Levels of Talin and Actin Disorganization—Morphological examination of control skeletal muscle by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated the presence of the integrin β1 subunit in the sarcolemma membrane (Fig. 2, panel a). As expected, there was a dramatic loss of integrin β1 expression in skeletal muscle of the MCKItgβ1 KO mice (Fig. 2, panel b). A concomitant loss of expression of the integrin β1 interacting protein talin was also observed in skeletal muscles of MCKItgβ1 KO mice (Fig. 2, panels c and d). Because β1 integrin receptors associate with the actin cytoskeleton via talin, we next investigated F-actin expression using phalloidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining (Fig. 3A, panels a-f). Concomitant with the reduction in talin there was reduced expression (52%) of F-actin in skeletal muscle of the MCKItgβ1 KO mice (Fig. 3B). The reduction in both talin and F-actin in skeletal muscle of the MCKItgβ1 KO mice occurred without a significant change in α-dystroglycan expression (data not shown).FIGURE 3Loss of β1 integrin receptor subunit expression results in a partial reduction and disorganization of F-actin filaments. A, gastrocnemius muscle was isolated from 14-week-old Itgβ1flox/flox and littermate MCK-Itgβ1 KO mice.

Over the first 48-h period, the mice were allowed to eat ad libitum, and there was no significant difference in activity during either the 12-h dark or 12-h light cycle. Similarly, locomotor activity was essentially identical when the animals were fasted either during the dark cycle or during the light cycle. To examine the ability of the mice to respond to a greater demand of motor activity, we next determined the exercise tolerance of the MCKItgβ1 KO mice (Fig. 4B). The control Itgβ1flox/flox and the MCKItgβ1 KO mice were run on a level treadmill (0° degree) at 10 m/min. Over the 25-min challenge the mice tested were able to maintain this pace, and no significant differences between the Itgβ1flox/flox control and MCK-Itgβ1 KO mice were observed. In contrast, on a 15° grade incline, on average the MCKItgβ1 KO mice could only run for 12 min, whereas the control mice were able to maintain this pace for more than 20 min. MCKItgβ1 KO Mice Display Insulin Resistance Due to Decreased Muscle Glucose Metabolism—To investigate the consequences of the muscle-specific ablation of the integrin β1 subunit on whole body glucose homeostasis and tissue-specific insulin action, we next examined changes in glucose and insulin levels during an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (Fig. 5). As reported in Table 1, there was no significant difference in the fasting plasma glucose levels between the controls and the KO mice. However the MCKItgβ1 KO mice displayed a trend toward impaired glucose tolerance that was significant at 120 min after glucose injection (Fig. 5A). Similarly, the fasting insulin levels were also not different compared with controls, but during the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test the insulin levels were significantly elevated in the MCKItgβ1 KO mice (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that the MCKItgβ1 KO mice display peripheral tissue insulin resistance that is compensated for by increased beta cell insulin secretion to maintain euglycemia. To more directly determine whether these mice are in fact insulin-resistant, we next performed a 2-h EU clamp in conscious MCKItgβ1 KO and Itgβ1flox/flox mice. No differences in plasma glucose or insulin levels were observed in either the basal or during the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp state (Fig. 6, A and B). However during the EU clamp, the rate of glucose infusion needed to maintain euglycemia increased rapidly in the control mice and reached a steady state. In contrast, the glucose infusion rate in response to insulin was reduced by 44% in the MCKItgβ1 KO mice compared with the control Itgβ1flox/flox mice (0.20 ± 0.03 versus 0.36 ± 0.02 mmol/kg/min) (Fig. 7A). Although there was no significant difference in glucose clearance between the MCKItgβ1 KO and control mice in the basal state, insulin-stimulated glucose clearance was significant decrease by 48% in the MCKItgβ1 KO mice (70.5 ± 5.6 versus 36.8 ± 9.4 ml/kg/min) (Fig. 7B). These data directly demonstrate the presence of insulin resistance in the MCKItgβ1 KO.FIGURE 7Loss of skeletal muscleβ1 integrin receptor subunit expression results in a decreased rate of insulin-stimulated glucose infusion rate and glucose clearance. A, EU clamps were used to assess whole body insulin sensitivity by determining the glucose infusion rate required to maintain euglycemia into control Itgβ1flox/flox (open boxes) and MCKItgβ1KO (filled boxes) mice. B, glucose clearance was determined as [3-3H]glucose-specific activity trace infusion rate and weight of mice in the basal or EU clamp state.

https://openalex.org/W2055196540,"Dysfunctions in theory of mind and empathic abilities have been suggested as core symptoms in major psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and autism. Since self monitoring, perspective taking and empathy have been linked to prefrontal (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) function, neurotransmitter variations in these areas may account for normal and pathological variations of these functions. Converging evidence indicates an essential role of glutamatergic neurotransmission in psychiatric diseases with pronounced deficits in empathy. However, the role of the glutamate system for different dimensions of empathy has not been investigated so far.Absolute concentrations of cerebral glutamate in the ACC, left dorsolateral PFC and left hippocampus were determined by 3-tesla proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in 17 healthy individuals. Three dimensions of empathy were estimated by a self-rating questionnaire, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI). Linear regression analysis showed that dorsolateral PFC glutamate concentration was predicted by IRI factor ""perspective taking"" (T = -2.710, p = 0.018; adjusted alpha-level of 0.017, Bonferroni) but not by ""empathic concern"" or ""personal distress"". No significant relationship between IRI subscores and the glutamate levels in the ACC or left hippocampus was detected.This is the first study to investigate the role of the glutamate system for dimensions of theory of mind and empathy. Results are in line with recent concepts that executive top-down control of behavior is mediated by prefrontal glutamatergic projections. This is a preliminary finding that needs a replication in an independent sample."
https://openalex.org/W2140362822,"This study was designed to investigate the impact of medical terminology on perceptions of disease. Specifically, we look at the changing public perceptions of newly medicalized disorders with accompanying newly medicalized terms (e.g. impotence has become erectile dysfunction disorder). Does using ""medicalese"" to label a recently medicalized disorder lead to a change in the perception of that condition? Undergraduate students (n = 52) rated either the medical or lay label for recently medicalized disorders (such as erectile dysfunction disorder vs. impotence) and established medical conditions (such as a myocardial infarction vs. heart attack) for their perceived seriousness, disease representativeness and prevalence. Students considered the medical label of the recently medicalized disease to be more serious (mean = 4.95 (SE = .27) vs. mean = 3.77 (SE = .24) on a ten point scale), more representative of a disease (mean = 2.47 (SE = .09) vs. mean = 1.83 (SE = .09) on a four point scale), and have lower prevalence (mean = 68 (SE = 12.6) vs. mean = 122 (SE = 18.1) out of 1,000) than the same disease described using common language. A similar pattern was not seen in the established medical conditions, even when controlled for severity. This study demonstrates that the use of medical language in communication can induce bias in perception; a simple switch in terminology results in a disease being perceived as more serious, more likely to be a disease, and more likely to be a rare condition. These findings regarding the conceptualization of disease have implications for many areas, including medical communication with the public, advertising, and public policy."
https://openalex.org/W2085539777,"Increasing evidence suggests that the cellular prion protein (PrPC) plays a protective role in response to oxidative stress, but the molecular mechanism is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that murine neuro-2a and human HeLa cells rapidly respond to an increase of intracellular copper concentration by up-regulating ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-mediated transcription of PrPC. Copper stimulation activates ATM by phosphorylation at Ser-1981, which leads to phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 and the initiation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular-related kinases/extracellular-related kinases (MEK/ERK)/Sp1 pathway. As results, Sp1 and p53 bind to the PrP promoter, leading to increase PrPC expression. Elevated PrPC correlates with reduction of intracellular copper concentration and suppression of Cu(II)-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species and cell death. Depletion of PrPC, ATM, p53, and/or Sp1 further demonstrates that ATM is a key regulatory protein to promote activation of p53 and Sp1 leading to PrPC elevation, which is required to reduce Cu(II) toxic effects and may play an important role in modulation of intracellular copper concentration.

Although research in prion diseases over past two decades has made significant progress, the normal function of PrPC remains elusive. PrPC, encoded by Prnp gene, is a glycoprotein that expresses in almost all tissues, including neurons and glial cells in the central nervous system (2Kretzschmar H.A. Prusiner S.B. Stowring L.E.

Third, the binding of copper to PrPC is pH-dependent, which favors the idea that PrPC might aid in transporting copper across the plasma membrane (14Viles J.H. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Goodin D.B. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2042-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Although PrPC is believed to involve the metabolism of copper, the molecular mechanism of the interaction between copper and PrPC is not well understood. Copper is an essential trace element associated with a variety of physiological functions. However, high concentrations of copper are toxic to the cells, which induce cellular oxidative stress leading to ROS accumulation. In this work we study the functional relationship between the Cu(II)-induced oxidative stress and the protective effect of PrPC. Our goal was to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the potential response of PrPC to oxidative stress induced by Cu(II). We demonstrate for the first time that endogenous PrPC rapidly reacts to Cu(II). Specifically, the Cu(II)-induced elevation of PrPC is modulated through transcriptional up-regulation mediated via the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM). The elevated PrPC protects against copper-induced oxidative stresses and cell death and plays an active role in modulation of intracellular copper concentration. Murine neuro-2a (N2a) and human HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. To establish a stable PrP-knockdown N2a cell line, N2a cells were transfected with the short hairpin RNA to the mouse PrP (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) and then selected by the addition of 1 μg/ml puromycin (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA) into the growth media. To transiently knock down the gene expressions of interest, we used siRNA pre-designed specifically to against Prnp (Ambion, Austin, TX), ATM, p53, and/or Sp1 along with the non-silencing control siRNA (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Each siRNA at a concentration of 100 nm was transfected into ∼5 × 105 N2a or HeLa cells using 15 μl of Oligofectamine following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated with or without 100 μm of CuCl2 or MgCl2 for different time periods and then harvested for further experiments. N2a and PrP-knockdown N2a cells in 96-well plates were incubated with 50 μm 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) (Invitrogen) for 45 min to allow DCFH-DA to diffuse into cells. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were then treated with 100 μm CuCl2 for 0, 10, 30, 60, 120, or 240 min. DCFH-DA is hydrolyzed by intracellular esterase to yield DCFH that is oxidized by H2O2 or low molecular weight peroxides in cells to produce the highly fluorescent compound, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). The DCF fluorescence intensity is determined using a Multiable Counter (Model Wallac 1420, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. The cell viability was measured by a 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT)-based cell growth determination kit (Sigma-Aldrich). N2a or PrP-knockdown N2a cells were incubated with 100 μm CuCl2 and collected at the indicated time points. After removal of medium, cells were aseptically added with MTT solution in an amount equal to 10% of the culture volume and incubated for 4 h. MTT formazan crystals were dissolved by the addition of MTT solvent in an amount equal to the original culture volume and incubated for 1 h. Absorbance was spectrophotometrically measured at a wavelength of 570 nm with subtraction of background absorbance measured at 690 nm. The trypan blue exclusion assay was used for the quantification of dead cells. Monolayers of N2a or the PrP-knockdown N2a cells were incubated with or without 100 μm of CuCl2 for an indicated period of time. Cells were trypsinized and then collected by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm for 10 min. After resuspension with PBS, cells were stained with 0.2% trypan blue (Sigma-Aldrich), and dying cells were identified by trypan blue-positive staining. Average and S.D. of copper-induced cell death were calculated based on three independent experiments. Student's t test was employed to determine significant differences between the control and different test groups. PrP mRNA Stability Assay—N2a cells were incubated with 100 μm CuCl2 for an indicated period of time and then treated with or without 5 μg/ml actinomycin D for 2 h. Cells were harvested, and the total RNA was extracted by RNAqueous-4RCR kit (Ambion). Two micrograms of the total RNA from each sample was used for reverse transcription (RT)-PCR by SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Tag (Invitrogen) to synthesize the cDNA of the mouse PrP, and β-actin was used as a control. The PCR products were separated on a 1% 1× Tris acetate EDTA (Tris-acetate EDTA)-agarose gel and analyzed on a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Densitometric analyses were used to normalize PrP cDNA to β-actin control cDNA and resulted in relative -fold increase in Prnp expression in N2a cells after treatment with Cu(II). A one-step real-time RT-PCR in which the RT reaction took place in the same tube was performed to determine Prnp gene transcription using LightCycler Probe Design software (Roche Applied Science). The PCR primers were designed as follows: mouse PrPC, forward 5′-CCA AGC TTA TGG CGA ACC TTG GCT GCT-3′ and reverse 5′-CCG AAT TCT CCC ACT ATC AGG AAG AT-3; mouse β-actin, forward 5′-GCC CTA GAC TTC GAG C-3′ and reverse 5′-CGC ATG TCA ACG TCA C-3. N2a cells were treated with 100 μm CuCl2 and collected at the indicated time points. Cells were harvested, and total RNA was extracted using RNAqueous-4RCR kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of total RNA (2 μg) from each sample were subjected to real-time RT-PCR using the iQ5 Multicolor Real-Time PCR detection system with the iScript one-step RT-PCR kit with SYBR Green (Bio-Rad) to quantify the possible elevation of the PrP mRNA after exposure of cells to Cu(II). The endogenous reference gene, β-actin, was used as a control. Assuming that the amplification efficiencies of the target gene (Prnp) and the control gene (β-actin) were very similar, ΔΔCT (ΔΔthreshold cycle) was calculated using the following formulae (Qiagen): ΔCT(control) =ΔCT(the target gene in the start sample) -ΔCT(the reference gene in the start sample); ΔCT(test) = ΔCT(the reference gene the test sample) -ΔCT(the target gene in the test sample); ΔΔCT = ΔCT(control) -ΔCT(test). Then, normalized target gene expression in the test sample = 2-ΔΔCT. Cells were homogenized in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was collected for experiments. For nuclear extracts, harvested cells were gently resuspended in lysis buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.3 m sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and then incubated on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation at 800 rpm for 5 min, the cell pellets were re-suspended in lysis buffer B, 10 mm Hepes, pH 8, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm EDTA, containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and then rocked at 4 °C for 2 h. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatants were stored as the nuclear extracts at -80 °C until use. After determination of protein concentrations by BCA protein assay (Pierce), the equivalent of 30 μg of total protein was loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad) and analyzed by Western blotting with the appropriate primary antibodies, i.e. 1:500 dilution of anti-PrP monoclonal antibody (mAb) SAF-32 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), 1:1,000 dilution of antibodies against ATM, phosphorylated ATM-Ser-1981, p53, phosphorylated p53-Ser-15, MEK1, and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), 1:500 dilution of anti-Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and a 1:10,000 dilution of anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). The appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) were used. The blots were visualized by using ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to Fuji Super RX x-ray film (Fuji Photo Film, Valhalla, NY) (20Qin K. O'Donnell M. Zhao R.Y. Neuroscience. 2006; 141: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The linear DNA fragments containing DNA sequences in the mouse Prnp promoter region (-1928/+52) (21Westaway D. Cooper C.

A. 1994; 91: 6418-6422Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and the human PRNP promoter region (-2560/+125) (22Mahal S.P. Asante E.A. Antoniou M. Collinge J. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 268: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were used as target DNAs. The nucleotide sequences of the probe sense strands are as follows: the putative Sp1 binding sites (-65/-35) 5′-ATC ACG CCC CGC CCC TCG CCC AGC CTA GCT CC-3′ and the putative p53 binding site (-1832/-1810) 5′-CTT GTC AAG ACT AGT TTG CCT CG-3′ in the mouse Prnp promoter; the putative Sp1 binding site (-71/-47) 5′-CTC GGC CGG CCG CCC GCC GGG GGC A-3′ and the putative p53 binding site (-757/-732) 5′-TTT CCC CAG GGC ATG CCT GGT TTA C-3′ in the human PRNP promoter. The competing oligonucleotides include the Sp1 consensus 5′-ATT CGA TCG GGG CGG GGC GAG C-3′ (23Hoffman P.W. Chernak J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2229-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and the p53 consensus 5′-AGG CAT GTC TAG GCA TG-3′ (24el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). Target DNAs were labeled with biotin by using a biotin 3′-end DNA labeling kit (Pierce). Two complement DNA sequences of the biotin-labeled target DNAs or unlabeled (cold) consensuses were annealed to become double strand oligonucleotides. N2a or HeLa cells were mock-transfected or transfected with control siRNA or siRNA to ATM for 48 h and then incubated with or without 100 μm CuCl2 for 30 min. Cells were harvested in PBS by centrifugation. The pelleted cells were lysed in the lysis buffer A containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.3 m sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and the protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The nuclei were pelleted, and nuclear proteins were extracted in lysis buffer B containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After measurement of the protein concentration by BCA protein assay (Pierce), the nuclear protein extracts were ready for EMSA. LightShift chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce) was used in the DNA-protein binding experiments. The biotin-labeled double strand target DNA was incubated with nuclear extracts from N2a or HeLa cells in solution containing 2.5% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 50 ng/μl poly(dI·dC) at room temperature for 20 min and then loaded onto 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris-buffered EDTA for electrophoresis. The binding reaction was then transferred to a Nylon membrane (Pierce). After cross-linking the transferred DNA to the membrane by ultraviolet light, the biotin-labeled DNA signals were detected by sequential incubations of the membrane with stabilized streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and lumino/enhancer solution (Pierce) and then exposure of the membrane to x-ray film. The binding of the predicted transcription factor to the specific target DNA formed a slower-migrated band than the original size of the starting target DNA. If an up-shifted band is seen in EMSA, it is an indication that the testing transcription factors, Sp1 or p53, may bind to the specific DNA sequence in the Prnp promoter. Specific binding of p53 or Sp1 to the oligonucleotides tested can be further confirmed by the competition experiment using 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled consensus oligonucleotides, which should eliminate the observed protein/DNA binding complex observed in EMSA. ICP-MS was used to determine the intracellular copper concentration. The ThermoFinnigan Element 2 (Waltham, MA) single collector ICP-MS device is a high resolution double focusing instrument operated in low resolution (m/Δm 300). Cells were treated with 100 μm CuCl2 and collected at 0, 10, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min after treatment. After washing twice with PBS, the number of cells was counted. Samples containing equal number of cells were centrifuged and dried at 60 °C for 3 h. The dried cell material was dissolved in 200 μl of 70% nitric acid and then diluted to 2% nitric acid and spiked with gallium. 71Ga was chosen as an internal standard because its m/z is similar to that of copper, and it causes no major spectroscopic interference. A 10 μl aliquot of a 10-ppm gallium standard was added to the each sample. A copper standard was prepared using 10 μl aliquots of standard solutions of in 1 ml of 2% nitric acid. All solutions were prepared with Milli-Q 18.2 mω water. The nitric acid blank, the copper standard, and each of the samples were introduced to the ICP via a 200 μl/min self-aspirating nebulizer in a cyclonic spray chamber (Glass Expansion). Between samples, the nitric acid blank was used to rinse the nebulizer. Results for each sample were calculated using the integrated average background-subtracted peak intensities from 20 consecutive scans. The concentration of copper of each sample was calculated with its protein concentration. Cu(II) Triggers Rapid Elevation of PrPC—The initial goal of this study was to evaluate the potential response of PrPC to the Cu(II) stimulation. As shown in Fig. 1A, endogenous PrPC was normally seen in N2a cells as di-, mono-, and non-glycosylated forms by Western analyses (Fig. 1A, a and e, lanes 1). To compare PrPC protein productions before and after incubation with Cu(II), the PrPC protein levels (Fig. 1A, a) were measured and normalized based on β-actin levels (Fig. 1A, b). Quantitative comparison of PrPC levels over time in Cu(II)-treated N2a cells are summarized in Fig. 1B (solid columns). Compared with the PrPC level in untreated N2a cells (Fig. 1A, a1), PrPC levels in Cu(II)-treated N2a cells increased rapidly to 2.7 ± 0.1- and 10.4 ± 3.2-fold above the base line 30 and 60 min after the treatment (Fig. 1, A, a lanes 3 and 4, and B, filled columns). Gradual declines of PrPC levels were seen followed with prolonged incubation, but the PrPC level remained significantly higher than the base line with a 4.7 ± 0.1-fold increase at 120 min and a 3.6 ± 0.17-fold increase at 240 min of incubation (Fig. 1A, a, lanes 5 and 6, and B, filled columns). Because cations such as Cu(II) induce ROS in cells, but Mg(II) does not (25Desoize B. In Vivo. 2003; 17: 529-539PubMed Google Scholar), we were interested in seeing whether Mg(II) can also trigger similar levels of PrPC elevation. The PrPC protein levels were essentially unchanged before and after incubation with 100 μm Mg(II) over the same time period as Cu(II) treatment (Fig. 1, A, e, lanes 1-6, and B, open columns). These data suggest that PrPC specifically responds to Cu(II), but it does not respond to Mg(II) (p > 0.05). To verify the observed protein elevations were indeed PrPC, the Prnp gene transcription was depleted by transfection with short hairpin RNA. Immunoblotting analysis showed that the Prnp gene depletion was successful, as the PrPC expression was essentially undetectable under the conditions as described in Fig. 1A, a. PrP Elevation Is Triggered through Increased Gene Transcription—To further investigate whether Cu(II)-induced acute elevation of PrPC occurs at the transcriptional level, we carried out RT-PCR and densitometric analyses to compare the Prnp mRNA levels with the control β-actin mRNAs in N2a cells after exposure them to Cu(II). With these analyses, we were able to determine the relative -fold increase of Prnp expression to the reference gene β-actin mRNA. Results of these analyses showed that the control β-actin mRNA expression levels as expected were nearly constant. In contrast, the PrP mRNA level in N2a cells increased from 1.53 ± 0.3-fold at 10 min to 4.46 ± 0.7-fold at 30 min after incubation with Cu(II). A gradual decline of the PrP mRNA levels were observed after 30 min (Fig. 2A, a, and B, filled columns). To distinguish whether the gradual decease of the PrP mRNA levels are due to mRNA stability or reduced ongoing transcription triggered by Cu(II), the same cells were treated at the indicated time points with actinomycin D (Act D), which stops gene transcription (26Perry R.P. Kelley D.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1970; 76: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 27Sobell H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5328-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), and all Act D-treated cells were collected at end of the experiments, i.e. 240 min. The mRNA levels with or without Act D treatment was then compared side-by-side (Fig. 2A), and their relative levels to β-actin were summarized in Fig. 2B. The addition of Act D did not cause significant changes in the levels of the PrP mRNA in N2a cells after incubation with Cu(II) at different time points (p > 0.05) (Fig. 2A, c, and B, open columns), suggesting that the elevated PrP mRNA levels observed over the experimental period was caused by an initial Cu(II)-mediated increase of Prnp gene transcription and not maintained by constant gene transcription. Thus, the PrP mRNA is relatively stable over a period of 240 min. To have a more accurate quantification of the PrP mRNA, we further performed real-time RT-PCR to quantify the amount of the Prnp mRNA in reference to the β-actin gene expression. The β-actin mRNA expression levels as measured by threshold cycle (CT) were nearly constant over the experimental period, i.e. within the normal cycle variation of 1.25 (p > 0.05). In contrast, a significant increase in the Prnp mRNA was observed in N2a cells under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 2C, Prnp mRNA levels in N2a cells increased from 2.5 ± 0.7-fold at 10 min to maximum level of 8.8 ± 1.9-fold at 30 min after the initial addition of Cu(II). A gradual decline was also observed thereafter, suggesting that PrPC expression is a dynamic process resulting from rapid cellular responses to Cu(II). However, at all time points the level of the Prnp mRNA in cells incubated with Cu(II) was significantly higher than that in the untreated cell control (p < 0.01), indicating that the rapid PrPC elevation induced by Cu(II) indeed occurs at the transcriptional level. Thus, our data demonstrate that production of PrPC can be rapidly elevated by Cu(II) through increased gene transcription, and this transcriptional modulation lasted up to 240 min without significant decay. Elevated PrPC Protects against Cu(II)-induced ROS Accumulation and Cell Death—High levels of Cu(II) causes cellular oxidative stress leading to ROS accumulation (28Gaetke L.M. Chow C.K. Toxicology. 2003; 189: 147-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar); therefore, our finding that Cu(II) rapidly increases PrPC expression (Fig. 1) may indicate that the elevated PrPC could be the specific cellular response to antagonize copper cytotoxicity. To test the potential effect of elevated PrPC on Cu(II)-induced oxidative stress or cell death, we monitored ROS accumulation, cellular viability, and cell death in cells that were treated with Cu(II) the same way as described in Fig. 1A. DCFH-DA was used as a specific probe to detect ROS in cells as described previously (29Manzl C. Enrich J. Ebner H. Dallinger R. Krumschnabel G. Toxicology. 2004; 196: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 30Wang H. Joseph J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1938) Google Scholar). DCFH-DA is a stable compound that readily diffuses into cells where it is hydrolyzed by intracellular esterase, resulting in loss of its diacetate group, thus yielding DCFH. Cells were washed with PBS, incubated with 100 μm Cu(II), and then collected at different time points. Cu(II)-induced H2O2 and low molecular weight peroxides can oxidize DCFH to produce the highly fluorescent compound, DCF (31Ischiropoulos H. Gow A. Thom S.R. Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 301: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 32Possel H. Noack H. Augustin W. Keilhoff G. Wolf G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), which is indicative of ROS production. Briefly, N2a and PrP-knockdown N2a cell cultures were first incubated with 50 μm DCFH-DA for 45 min. The intensity of the DCF fluorescence was determined. After exposure of N2a cells to Cu(II), the DCF fluorescence rapidly increased (2.1 ± 0.3-fold) within 10 min (Fig. 3A, open circle) in comparison with the untreated N2a cells (Fig. 3A, filled triangles). A similar level of DCF increase was also observed in the PrP-knockdown N2a cells (Fig. 3A, open circle). However, instead of a gradual decrease of the DCF fluorescence as shown in the wild type cells (Fig. 3A), a small but steady increase of DCF was detected in the PrP-knocking down cells over a period of 240 min (Fig. 3A). Overall, Cu(II) induced consistently higher levels of ROS in the PrP-knockdown N2a cells than in the wild type N2a cells (p < 0.01). Because the only difference between these two cell lines is the presence or absence of PrPC, this observation suggests that Cu(II)-induced PrPC elevation (Figs. 1 and 2) may prevent ROS accumulation. It is notabl"

In this study, we show that tryptophan replacement of two highly conserved tyrosines in the transmembrane domain of both Na,K- and gastric H,K-ATPase β-subunits resulted in considerable shifts of the voltage-dependent E1P/E2P distributions toward the E1P state as inferred from presteady-state current and voltage clamp fluorometric measurements of tetramethylrhodamine-6-maleimide-labeled ATPases. The shifts in conformational equilibria were accompanied by significant decreases in the apparent affinities for extracellular K+ that were moderate for the Na,K-ATPase β-(Y39W,Y43W) mutation but much more pronounced for the corresponding H,K-ATPase β-(Y44W,Y48W) variant. Moreover in the Na,K-ATPase β-(Y39W,Y43W) mutant, the apparent rate constant for reverse binding of extracellular Na+ and the subsequent E2P-E1P conversion, as determined from transient current kinetics, was significantly accelerated, resulting in enhanced Na+ competition for extracellular K+ binding especially at extremely negative potentials. Analogously the reverse binding of extracellular protons and subsequent E2P-E1P conversion was accelerated by the H,K-ATPase β-(Y44W,Y48W) mutation, and H+ secretion was strongly impaired. Remarkably tryptophan replacements of residues in the M7 segment of Na,K- and H,K-ATPase α-subunits, which are at interacting distance to the β-tyrosines, resulted in similar E1 shifts, indicating their participation in stabilization of E2. Thus, interactions between selected residues within the transmembrane regions of α- and β-subunits of P2C-type ATPases exert an E2-stabilizing effect, which is of particular importance for efficient H+ pumping by H,K-ATPase under in vivo conditions.

The ubiquitous sodium pump and the closely related gastric proton pump are members of the P-type ATPase family that comprises more than 200 identified members (1Palmgren M.G. Axelsen K.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1998; 1365: 37-45Google Scholar, 2Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol.. 1998; 46: 84-101Google Scholar). Apart from the highly homologous Na,K-ATPase α-isoforms, the catalytic subunits of Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPase share the highest sequence identity in the whole family (of about 62% between Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit and gastric H,K-ATPase α-subunit (3Shull G.E. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 1986; 261: 16788-16791Google Scholar)). Besides the bacterial Kdp-ATPase, which is composed of four essential subunits (4Altendorf K. Gassel M. Puppe W. Mollenkamp T. Zeeck A. Boddien C. Fendler K. Bamberg E. Drose S. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl.. 1998; 643: 137-146Google Scholar), Na,K- and H,K-ATPases are the only P-type ATPase family members that require an additional β-subunit for folding, membrane insertion, and plasma membrane delivery of the catalytically active α-subunits (5Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 1993; 268: 14342-14347Google Scholar, 6McDonough A.A. Geering K. Farley R.A. FASEB J.. 1990; 4: 1598-1605Google Scholar, 7Geering K. FEBS Lett.. 1991; 285: 189-193Google Scholar). With only 20-30% overall sequence identity the three Na,K-ATPase β-subunit isoforms and the H,K-ATPase β-subunits from difference species are much less conserved than the α-subunits. However, all known β-subunits share the same basic overall structure: a short intracellular N-terminal domain followed by a single transmembrane span and a large C-terminal ectodomain, which contains highly conserved glycosylation sites and disulfide bridge-forming cysteine residues. Because a unique feature of the oligomeric members of the P-type ATPase family is the ability to transport K+ ions, it was speculated (8Geering K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr.. 2001; 33: 425-438Google Scholar) that some structural particularities in the α-subunit that are required for potassium transport may be detrimental for proper folding and membrane integration and that the negative influence on these critical processes is overcome by the association with accessory subunits. In addition to this chaperone-like function, the β-subunit is essential for enzyme activity (9Noguchi S. Mishina M. Kawamura M. Numa S. FEBS Lett.. 1987; 225: 27-32Google Scholar) and influences the transport properties of mature sodium and proton pumps. The existence of various tissue-specific Na,K-ATPase β-subunit isoforms, which result in holoenzymes with different cation affinities (10Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol.. 1994; 103: 605-623Google Scholar, 11Crambert G. Hasler U. Beggah A.T. Yu C. Modyanov N.N. Horisberger J.D. Lelievre L. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 1976-1986Google Scholar), and the fact that Na,K-ATPase α-subunits co-expressed with H,K-ATPase β-subunits form active pumps (12Horisberger J.D. Jaunin P. Reuben M.A. Lasater L.S. Chow D.C. Forte J.G. Sachs G. Rossier B.C. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem.. 1991; 266: 19131-19134Google Scholar), albeit with altered ion affinities (10Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol.. 1994; 103: 605-623Google Scholar, 13Eakle K.A. Kim K.S. Kabalin M.A. Farley R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1992; 89: 2834-2838Google Scholar), strongly suggest a modulatory function of the β-subunit for ion translocation. Results from several studies indicate that it is mainly the C-terminal extracellular domain of the β-subunit that modulates cation transport. For example, reduction of the disulfide bonds in the ectodomain of the β-subunit impairs the function of purified Na,K- or H,K-ATPase. Because this was prevented in the presence of cations (14Kawamura M. Ohmizo K. Morohashi M. Nagano K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1985; 821: 115-120Google Scholar, 15Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry.. 1993; 32: 6737-6743Google Scholar, 16Chow D.C. Browning C.M. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol.. 1992; 263: C39-C46Google Scholar), a potential role of the β-subunit in K+ occlusion has been suggested. Functional analysis of chimeras between Na,K- and H,K-ATPase β-subunits confirmed that mostly α-β ectodomain interactions are responsible for the observed effects of the β-subunit on cation affinity and occlusion of the sodium pump (17Jaunin P. Jaisser F. Beggah A.T. Takeyasu K. Mangeat P. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. J. Cell Biol.. 1993; 123: 1751-1759Google Scholar, 18Eakle K.A. Kabalin M.A. Wang S.G. Farley R.A. J. Biol. Chem.. 1994; 269: 6550-6557Google Scholar, 19Hasler U. Wang X. Crambert G. Beguin P. Jaisser F. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem.. 1998; 273: 30826-30835Google Scholar). This is also in line with the electron density of the first 10-15 residues of the ectodomain, which was tentatively traced in the recent x-ray structure of the pig Na,K-ATPase holoenzyme (20Morth J.P. Pedersen B.P. Toustrup-Jensen M.S. Sorensen T.L. Petersen J. Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Nissen P. Nature.. 2007; 450: 1043-1049Google Scholar) and clearly indicates that the extracellular M5/M6 and M7/M8 loops of the α-subunit are covered by a “lid” formed by the ectodomain of the β-subunit as suggested previously (15Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry.. 1993; 32: 6737-6743Google Scholar). Yet not only ectodomain modifications have been shown to alter the transport properties. N-terminal truncation of the cytoplasmic domain of the β-subunit of the Na,K-ATPase resulted in changes of the apparent K+ (19Hasler U. Wang X. Crambert G. Beguin P. Jaisser F. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem.. 1998; 273: 30826-30835Google Scholar, 21Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol.. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Google Scholar) and Na+ affinities (19Hasler U. Wang X. Crambert G. Beguin P. Jaisser F. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem.. 1998; 273: 30826-30835Google Scholar) and affected the conformational equilibrium (22Abriel H. Hasler U. Geering K. Horisberger J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1999; 1418: 85-96Google Scholar). Likewise an inhibitory antibody, which recognizes an epitope within the first 36 N-terminal amino acids of the β-subunit of H,K-ATPase (23Chow D.C. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol.. 1993; 265: C1562-C1570Google Scholar), altered the K+ affinity. However, cytoplasmic interactions are probably not directly responsible for the functional effects of β-subunits on cation binding of the sodium pump because, in contrast to a complete truncation, deletions or multiple mutational alterations of the N terminus did not affect the K+ activation of Na,K-ATPase expressed in Xenopus oocytes (19Hasler U. Wang X. Crambert G. Beguin P. Jaisser F. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem.. 1998; 273: 30826-30835Google Scholar). Furthermore results from a glycosylation mapping assay indicated a repositioning of the transmembrane segment as a consequence of the N-terminal truncation (24Hasler U. Greasley P.J. von Heijne G. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 29011-29022Google Scholar). This in turn may also impair the conformation of the ectodomain, whose significance for cation occlusion has already been out-lined above. Even the observed repositioning of the transmembrane domain (TMD) 2The abbreviations used are: TMD, transmembrane domain; TMRM, tetramethylrhodamine-6-maleimide; VCF, voltage clamp fluorometry; wt, wild type; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; TMACl, tetramethylammonium chloride; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. itself could be responsible for the reported K+ effects in the N-terminally truncated β-variant because mutations in the TMD have also been shown to modify cation transport: tryptophan scanning mutagenesis in the TMD of the Na,K-ATPase β-subunit revealed that the replacement of two tyrosines by tryptophan has distinct and additive consequences for the cation affinities of the holoenzyme (25Hasler U. Crambert G. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 16356-16364Google Scholar). Interestingly these tyrosines are highly conserved; they are actually present in all known β-subunits (represented by red capital letters in the β-TMD alignment shown in Fig. 1C). The apparent K½ for extracellular K activation of pump currents in Xenopus oocytes was significantly increased for a simultaneous tryptophan replacement of the two tyrosines in various β-subunit isoforms. Of note, this was accompanied by an increase of the apparent affinity for intracellular sodium and a reduced sensitivity toward the E2-specific inhibitor vanadate. Therefore, it was concluded that the affinity changes might occur secondarily to a conformational, i.e. E2-destabilizing, effect of the β-subunit mutations (25Hasler U. Crambert G. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 16356-16364Google Scholar). However, direct evidence for a shift in the E1P/E2P distribution of the enzyme has not been provided yet. Given the high propensity of native gastric H,K-ATPase to occur in the E2 state (26Helmich-de Jong M.L. van Emst-de Vries S.E. De Pont J.J. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M. Bonting S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1985; 821: 377-383Google Scholar), which has been speculated to be of primary importance for efficient H+ delivery to the luminal fluid against a 106-fold H+ gradient in vivo, it is of high interest to identify possible interaction sites on the β- and ultimately also on the transmembrane domains of the α-subunit that are crucial for this unique E2-specific structural stabilization. In the current study we set out to identify molecular determinants of E2-specific intersubunit interactions and utilized the technique of voltage clamp fluorometry (VCF) to directly determine the distribution between E1 and E2 states of wild type and mutated Na,K- and H,K-ATPase enzymes (27Geibel S. Kaplan J.H. Bamberg E. Friedrich T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2003; 100: 964-969Google Scholar, 28Dempski R.E. Friedrich T. Bamberg E. J. Gen. Physiol.. 2005; 125: 505-520Google Scholar). Because this method can be applied to the electrogenic Na,K-ATPase as well as to the electroneutrally operating gastric H,K-ATPase (29Geibel S. Zimmermann D. Zifarelli G. Becker A. Koenderink J.B. Hu Y.K. Kaplan J.H. Friedrich T. Bamberg E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci.. 2003; 986: 31-38Google Scholar, 30Dürr K.L. Tavraz N.N. Zimmermann D. Bamberg E. Friedrich T. Biochemistry.. 2008; 47: 4288-4297Google Scholar), whether mutation of the conserved tyrosines causes similar conformational shifts in both enzymes can be investigated. Evidence is provided that the observed conformational effects are of a more general significance for ion translocation by oligomeric P-type ATPases. Furthermore we compared for both enzymes the effects of these β-subunit mutations on apparent cation affinities, which occur in conjunction with shifts in the distribution of E1P/E2P conformational states. Moreover we studied the effect of mutations of selected residues in the TMD7 of the Na,K- and H,K-ATPase α-subunit that are at interacting distance to the two β-subunit tyrosines (Fig. 1B). This strategy provided novel insights about the molecular details of interactions between β- and α-subunit transmembrane domains of oligomeric P2C-type ATPases that are responsible for stabilization of the E2 conformational state. Molecular Biology—The cDNAs of the sheep Na,K-ATPase β1-subunit, rat H,K-ATPase β-subunit, rat gastric H,K-ATPase α-subunit, and a modified form of the sheep Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit without extracellularly exposed cysteine residues (containing mutations C911S and C964A (31Hu Y.K. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 19185-19191Google Scholar)) and with reduced ouabain sensitivity in the millimolar range (achieved by the mutations Q111R and N122D (32Price E.M. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry.. 1988; 27: 8400-8408Google Scholar)) were subcloned into vector pTLN (33Lorenz C. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1996; 92: 13362-13366Google Scholar) as described previously (27Geibel S. Kaplan J.H. Bamberg E. Friedrich T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2003; 100: 964-969Google Scholar, 28Dempski R.E. Friedrich T. Bamberg E. J. Gen. Physiol.. 2005; 125: 505-520Google Scholar). The reduced ouabain sensitivity of the latter construct allows selective inhibition of the endogenous Xenopus Na,K-ATPase and was therefore used for all co-expression studies with mutated β1-constructs or as template for site-directed mutagenesis of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit. Furthermore to exclude any background signals in voltage clamp fluorometric studies that could possibly arise from Na,K-ATPase enzymes assembled from heterologously expressed α-subunits and endogenous β-subunits we utilized the β1-subunit sequence variant S62C for mutagenesis. The introduced cysteine is close to the transmembrane/extracellular interface and has been shown to give rise to voltage-dependent fluorescence changes upon site-directed fluorescence labeling with tetramethylrhodamine-6-maleimide (TMRM) without impairing enzyme function (28Dempski R.E. Friedrich T. Bamberg E. J. Gen. Physiol.. 2005; 125: 505-520Google Scholar). To enable voltage clamp fluorometry on gastric H,K-ATPase, we co-expressed the wild type (or mutated) H,K-ATPase β-subunits with a modified H,K-ATPase α-subunit with a single cysteine replacement of a serine in the M5/M6 extracellular loop (S806C) that is homologous to the N790C mutation in the M5/M6 loop of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit (28Dempski R.E. Friedrich T. Bamberg E. J. Gen. Physiol.. 2005; 125: 505-520Google Scholar) and thus also suited for environmentally sensitive TMRM labeling (29Geibel S. Zimmermann D. Zifarelli G. Becker A. Koenderink J.B. Hu Y.K. Kaplan J.H. Friedrich T. Bamberg E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci.. 2003; 986: 31-38Google Scholar). Rubidium uptake measurements confirmed that the S806C mutation did not affect the transport properties of H,K-ATPase (30Dürr K.L. Tavraz N.N. Zimmermann D. Bamberg E. Friedrich T. Biochemistry.. 2008; 47: 4288-4297Google Scholar). This construct was therefore used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis to introduce mutations in TMD7 of the H,K-ATPase α-subunit. All mutations were done using the QuikChange multi site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing. Oocyte Preparation and cRNA Injection—Xenopus oocytes were obtained by collagenase treatment after partial ovariectomy from Xenopus laevis females. cRNAs were prepared using the SP6 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, Texas). A 50-nl aliquot containing 20-25 ng of Na,K-ATPase and 1.5-2.5 ng of Na,K-ATPase β1-subunit cRNA (or 20-25 ng of H,K-ATPase α-subunit cRNA and 5 ng of H,K-ATPase β-subunit) were injected into each cell. After injection, oocytes were kept in ORI buffer (110 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 50 mg/liter gentamycin at 18 °C for 3-5 and 2 days for the Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPase, respectively. Isolation of Plasma Membranes from X. laevis Oocytes—The isolation of plasma membranes was carried out using positively charged silica beads as described by Kamsteeg and Deen (35Kamsteeg E.J. Deen P.M. Am. J. Physiol.. 2000; 279: F778-F784Google Scholar), who reported a 25- or 450-fold higher yield with this technique compared with standard isolation or biotinylation procedures. Moreover because binding of these beads is carried out on intact oocytes, a high purity of the plasma membrane fraction is achieved with only minor contaminations by internal membranes (36Kamsteeg E.J. Deen P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2001; 282: 683-690Google Scholar). After removal of their follicular cell layer, 8-12 oocytes were rotated in 1% colloidal silica (Ludox Cl, Sigma-Aldrich) in MES-buffered saline for silica (MBSS; 20 mm MES, 80 mm NaCl, pH 6.0) for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing two times in MBSS, the oocytes were rotated at 4 °C in 0.1% polyacrylic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) in MBSS for 30 min. This blocking agent is added to coat unbound beads and solvent-exposed surfaces of beads that were already bound to oocytes. Afterward the oocytes were washed two times in modified Barth's solution (MBS; 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). Subsequently oocytes were homogenized in 1.5 ml of buffer HbA (20 mm Tris, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, 80 mm sucrose, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitor (Complete; Roche Applied Science) and centrifuged for 30 s at 10 × g at 4 °C after which 1.3 ml of the sample supernatant was removed (to be saved for subsequent preparation of total membranes; see below), and 1 ml of HbA was added to the silica beads. This centrifugation and exchange of HbA was repeated three times, but centrifugation changed from twice at 10 × g to once at 20 × g to once at 40 × g. After the last centrifugation step, HbA was removed, and plasma membranes were spun down for 30 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C and resuspended in Laemmli buffer (37Laemmli U.K. Nature.. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) (4 μl/oocyte). Preparation of Total Membranes from X. laevis Oocytes—To remove yolk platelets, the supernatant from homogenized oocytes in HbA containing protease inhibitor (see above) was centrifuged once for 3 min at 2,000 × g at 4 °C, and the pellet was discarded. Total membranes in the supernatant were spun down for 30 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C and resuspended in 4 μl/oocyte Laemmli buffer (37Laemmli U.K. Nature.. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Protein samples equivalent to two oocytes were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted on nitrocellulose membranes (Roth). The α- and β-subunits of the rat gastric H,K-ATPase were detected with the polyclonal anti-H,Kα-antibody HK12.18 (5Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 1993; 268: 14342-14347Google Scholar) (Merck) and the monoclonal anti-H,Kβ-antibody 2G11 (23Chow D.C. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol.. 1993; 265: C1562-C1570Google Scholar) (Acris Antibodies), respectively. Subsequently blots were incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako), and proteins were visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Roche Applied Science). Rb+ Uptake Assay Using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry—Two days after injection, noninjected control oocytes and H,K-ATPase-expressing oocytes were preincubated for 15 min in a Rb+- and K+-free solution (90 mm TMACl or NaCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 5 mm BaCl2, 5 mm NiCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 100 μm ouabain to ensure inhibition of the endogenous Na,K-ATPase and then incubated for 15 min under temperature control in Rb+ flux buffer at 21 °C (5 mm RbCl, 85 mm TMACl or NaCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 5 mm BaCl2, 5 mm NiCl2, 10 mm MES, pH 5.5, 100 μm ouabain). After three washing steps in Rb+-free washing buffer (90 mm TMACl or NaCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 5 mm BaCl2, 5 mm NiCl2, 10 mm MES, pH 5.5) and one wash in water, each individual oocyte was homogenized in 1 ml of Milli-Q® water (Millipore, Billerica, MA). To determine the apparent constant K½ for half-maximal activation of the H,K-ATPase by rubidium, the sum of [TMACl or NaCl] plus [RbCl] in the Rb+ flux buffer was kept constant at 90 mm, e.g. 1 mm RbCl + 89 mm TMACl (or NaCl). After subtraction of the mean of Rb+ uptake into control oocytes of the same batch at a given RbCl concentration, the data were fitted to a Michaelis-Menten type function. V=Vmax·[S]K0.5+[S](Eq. 1) Oocyte homogenates were analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy using an AAnalyst800™ spectrometer (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). From oocyte homogenates (typically 1 ml) samples of 20 μl were automatically transferred into a transversely heated graphite furnace and subjected to a temperature protocol according to the manufacturer's procedures (conditions are available on request), and absorption was measured at 780 nm using a rubidium hollow cathode lamp (Photron, Melbourne, Australia). After Zeeman background correction, Rb+ contents were calculated by comparison with standard calibration curves (measured between 0 and 50 μg/liter Rb+). The detection limit (characteristic mass) of Rb+ is ∼10 pg. Oocyte Pretreatment, Fluorescence Labeling, and Experimental Solutions—Prior to functional studies on Na,K-ATPase-expressing oocytes, cells were first incubated for 45 min in Na+ loading buffer (110 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm sodium citrate, 5 mm MOPS, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4), and then for 15 min in postloading buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm BaCl2, 5 mm NiCl2, 5 mm MOPS/Tris, pH 7.4 (38Rakowski R.F. J. Gen. Physiol.. 1993; 101: 117-144Google Scholar)) to elevate the intracellular Na+ concentration. For voltage clamp fluorometry, site-specific labeling was achieved by incubating oocytes in postloading buffer containing 5 μm TMRM (Molecular Probes; stock solution, 5 mm in DMSO) for 5 min at room temperature in the dark followed by extensive washes in dye-free postloading buffer. Measurements under high extracellular Na+/K+-free conditions were carried out in Na+ test solution (100 mm NaCl, 5 mm BaCl2, 5 mm NiCl2, 5 mm MOPS/Tris, pH 7.4, 10 μm ouabain). The following solution was used for VCF measurements on H,K-ATPase: 90 mm TMACl or NaCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 5 mm BaCl2, 5 mm NiCl2, 10 mm MES, pH 5.5. Stationary currents of the Na,K-ATPase were measured upon a solution exchange from 0 to 10 mm K+ (10 mm KCl, 90 mm NaCl, 5 mm BaCl2, 5 mm NiCl2, 5 mm MOPS/Tris, pH 7.4, 10 μm ouabain). To determine the apparent constant K½ for half-maximal activation of the Na,K-ATPase by K+, the sum of [NaCl] plus [KCl] in the Na+ test solution was kept constant at 100 mm, e.g. 1 mm KCl + 99 mm NaCl. After rundown correction of stationary currents (if necessary) at a given K+ concentration, the data were fitted to a Michaelis-Menten type function (Equation 1). The sheep Na,K-ATPase could be inhibited by 10 mm ouabain, and the rat gastric H,K-ATPase could be inhibited by 10 μm SCH28080 (Sigma-Aldrich) or 30 μm omeprazole (Biotrend, Zürich, Switzerland). Voltage Clamp Fluorometry—An oocyte perfusion chamber was mounted in an Axioskop 2FS epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) equipped with a 40× water immersion objective (numerical aperture = 0.8). Currents were measured using a two-electrode voltage clamp amplifier (Turbotec 05, npi electronic GmbH, Tamm, Germany). Fluorescence was excited with a 100-watt tungsten lamp using filters 535DF50 (excitation), 565EFLP (emission), and 570DRLP (dichroic; all from Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT). Fluorescence was measured with a PIN-022A photodiode (United Detector Technologies, Hawthorne, CA) mounted to the microscope camera port. Photocurrents were amplified by a low noise current amplifier (DLPCA-200, FEMTO, Berlin, Germany). Fluorescence and currents were recorded simultaneously using a Digidata 1322A interface and subsequently analyzed with Clampex 9.2 and Clampfit 9.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Apparent K½ values for extracellular K+ were obtained by titration experiments as described previously (28Dempski R.E. Friedrich T. Bamberg E. J. Gen. Physiol.. 2005; 125: 505-520Google Scholar). Analysis of Transient Currents of the Na,K-ATPase—Presteady-state currents under high extracellular Na+/K+-free conditions were obtained by subtracting the current responses to voltage steps from -40 mV to values between +60 and -180 mV (20-mV increments) in the presence of 10 mm ouabain (inhibiting the endogenously as well as the heterologously expressed pump) from currents measured in the presence of 10 μm ouabain (inhibiting only the endogenous Na,K-ATPase). The resulting difference currents were fitted monoexponentially, disregarding the first 3-5 ms after the voltage step to exclude capacitive artifacts. The translocated charge Q was calculated from the integral of the fitted transient currents, and the resulting Q-V curves were approximated by a Boltzmann-type function, Q(V)=Qmax+Qmax−Qmin(1+exp(Zq⋅FR⋅T(V−V0.5)))(Eq. 2) where Qmin and Qmax are the saturating values of translocated charge, V0.5 is the midpoint potential, zq is the fraction of charge displaced through the entire transmembrane field, F is the Faraday constant, R is the molar gas constant, T is the temperature (in K), and V is the transmembrane potential. All experiments were performed at 22-24 °C. Extracellular pH Measurements—A qualitative assay for the acidification of the extracellular medium mediated by H+ secretion of Xenopus oocytes expressing gastric H,K-ATPase was carried out according to Jaisser et al. (39Jaisser F. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. Rossier B.C. J. Cell Biol.. 1993; 123: 1421-1429Google Scholar). Two days after injection, oocytes were incubated for 5 min in a weakly buffered solution (70 mm TMACl, 20 mm RbCl, 5 mm BaCl2, 5 mm NiCl2, 500 μm MOPS, adjusted to pH 7.4 with tetramethylammonium hydroxide) containing the pH indicator phenol red (200 μg/ml). In some experiments, SCH28080 (100 μm) was added to the solution. Oocytes were placed individually in a small drop (0.5-1 μl) of the same solution under mineral oil. Every 2 min a color picture was taken at room temperature. E1P/E2P Conformational Distribution and Kinetics of the E1P/E2P Transition for Na,K-ATPase Wild Type and β-(Y39W,Y43W) Mutant Enzymes—To determine whether the double mutation Y39W/Y43W in the Na,K-ATPase β1-subunit causes the proposed shift of the conformational equilibrium of the enzyme toward E1 (25Hasler U. Crambert G. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 16356-16364Google Scholar), the two tryptophans were introduced into the reporter construct β1-S62C and co-expressed with the α1-subunit in Xenopus oocytes. Upon labeling with the environmentally sensitive dye TMRM, we applied voltage jumps under extracellularly high Na+, K+-free conditions. Under these conditions, the sodium pump carries out Na+/Na+ exchange where the enzyme shuttles exclusively between E1P/E2P states of the catalytic cycle. The ratio E1P/E2Pis incr"
https://openalex.org/W1979287848,"The purpose of this study was to identify the Pseudomonas aeruginosa-activated signaling pathway leading to interleukin (IL)-8 gene expression and protein synthesis by human conjunctival epithelium. IL-8 protein and mRNA were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and reverse transcription-PCR, respectively. Activation of MAPKs and NF-κB was analyzed by Western blotting using phosphospecific antibodies. We used transfection with wild-type or mutated IL-8 promoters and cotransfection with transcription factor overexpressing plasmids or small interfering RNAs. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were performed for in vitro and in vivo protein-DNA binding studies, respectively. P. aeruginosa increased IL-8 expression at the transcriptional level by phosphorylating CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) via p38MAPK and activating NF-κB. The simultaneous involvement of RelA and C/EBPβ and the integrity of the corresponding consensus sites were required, whereas c-Jun was involved only in basal IL-8 expression. Re-ChIP experiments showed that RelA and C/EBPβ act together at the IL-8 promoter level upon P. aeruginosa infection. Taken together, our results suggest that P. aeruginosa induces IL-8 promoter expression and protein production in conjunctival epithelial cells by activating RelA and C/EBPβ and by promoting the cooperative binding of these transcription factors to the IL-8 promoter that in turn activates transcription.

Taken together, our results suggest that P. aeruginosa induces IL-8 promoter expression and protein production in conjunctival epithelial cells by activating RelA and C/EBPβ and by promoting the cooperative binding of these transcription factors to the IL-8 promoter that in turn activates transcription. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen causing a wide range of acute and chronic infections prevalently in susceptible hosts. Immunocompromised or mechanically ventilated people, transplant recipients, or patients bearing malignancies, cystic fibrosis, or human immunodeficiency virus infection all are at increased risk of being affected by P. aeruginosa (1Saiman L.

The role of various proinflammatory cytokines in the regulation of host defense by epithelia during infections caused by P. aeruginosa has been extensively studied. It has been shown that several P. aeruginosa virulence factors, both cell-associated and extracellular products, are potent inducers of proinflammatory mediators, such as IL-1, 2The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; CAPE, caffeic acid phenethyl ester; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; AP-1, activator protein-1; wt, wild-type; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; IκBα, NF-κB inhibitor α. 2The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; CAPE, caffeic acid phenethyl ester; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; AP-1, activator protein-1; wt, wild-type; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; IκBα, NF-κB inhibitor α.

In particular, IL-8 overexpression has been shown to induce ulcer formation in the cornea through neutrophil recruitment (27Oka M. Norose K. Matsushima K. Hishigori C. Herlyn M. Br. J. Ophthalmol. 2006; 90: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To our knowledge no data are available about the ability of P. aeruginosa to induce IL-8 synthesis by conjunctival epithelium. The complexity of the regulation of cytokine gene transcription and the variety of the signal transduction systems leading to the induction of gene expression in a cell type-specific manner (28Mori N. Oishi K. Sar B. Mukaida N. Nagatake T. Matsushima K. Yamamoto N. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3872-3878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) require the understanding of the mechanisms of conjunctival innate immunity following P. aeruginosa challenge. In this study we characterized the molecular activation sequence leading to P. aeruginosa-triggered IL-8 expression in conjunctiva epithelial cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Culture Conditions—Experiments were performed in adherence to the Helsinki Declaration. Conjunctival epithelial samples were collected by brush cytology from 23 healthy volunteers (43 eyes; 12 men and 11 women; mean age, 37 years; range, 24–50 years). Primary conjunctival epithelial cells were cultured as described previously (29Narayanan S. Miller W.L. McDermott A.M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 3795-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly conjunctival tissue was incubated overnight at 4 °C in a 1:1 (v/v) solution of EpiLife medium and dispase (20 units/ml). Using a scalpel blade, the epithelial cells were then scraped free and seeded into a fibronectin/collagen-coated flask with EpiLife medium. Primary cultured conjunctival epithelial cells of passages 1–3 were used for the experiments. The human conjunctiva epithelial cell line Chang was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and it was cultured as described previously (30Venza I. Cucinotta M. Caristi S. Mancuso G. Teti D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Cytokine Production Assay—Cultured cells were stimulated for 6 h with different concentrations of heat-killed or live P. aeruginosa, and IL-8 in the supernatants was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Bio Source International, Nivelles, Belgium).Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) from cultured cells (3 × 106 cells/well) stimulated with heat-killed or live bacterium. One microgram was reverse transcribed in a volume of 20 μl with the IMProm-II™ Reverse Transcriptase kit (Promega, Milan, Italy). cDNA amplification was performed as described previously (30Venza I. Cucinotta M. Caristi S. Mancuso G. Teti D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Western Blotting Analysis—Chang cells extracts were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting as reported previously (30Venza I. Cucinotta M. Caristi S. Mancuso G. Teti D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The membranes were probed with the following antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions: anti-c-Jun, anti-RelA, anti-C/EBPβ, and anti-IKBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and phosphospecific anti-p38, anti-ATF-2, anti-c-Jun, anti-C/EBPβ, and anti-IKBα (Cell Signaling Technology, Milan, Italy).Transient Transfections and RNA Silencing—Chang cells (3 × 106 cells/well) were transiently transfected with 1 μg of IL-8 promoter constructs described in Fig. 7A using FuGENE® 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Diagnostics) as reported previously (30Venza I. Cucinotta M. Caristi S. Mancuso G. Teti D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Where indicated, cells transfected with wt IL-8 promoter were cotransfected with wt and dominant negative trans-activation domain mutant (TAM-67) c-Jun, RelA, NFKB1, or C/EBPβ expression vectors (0.2 μg) and the doublestranded siRNAs (50 nm; Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) reported in Table 1. After 24 and 48 h, respectively, cells were infected with P. aeruginosa for 6 h. In some experiments, 20 μm SB203580, SP600125, and CAPE (Calbiochem) were added 1 h before stimulation. Protein concentrations were determined with a colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad), and luciferase activity was assayed with luciferase assay reagent (Promega). Transfection efficiency was monitored by cotransfecting the cells with the pnls-LacZ plasmid (0.5 μg).TABLE 1Sequences of double-stranded siRNAs usedsiRNAsSequence (5′-3′)c-JunGGAUCAAGGCGGAGAGGAARelAGUGACAAGGUGCAGAAAGAC/EBPβCCAAGAAGACCGUGGACAAControlCAGUGGAGAUCAACGUGCAAGUU Open table in a new tab Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The ChIP enzymatic assay (Active Motif) was carried out, and the sheared chromatin samples were used for immunoprecipitation with 2 μg of anti-c-Jun, anti-RelA, anti-C/EBPβ, or anti-NFKB1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were subjected to cross-link reversal, extracted, and precipitated as described in the protocol. The eluted DNA and the aliquots of chromatin prior to immunoprecipitation (input) were amplified by PCR. Re-ChIP was performed according to Lambertini et al. (31Lambertini E. Tavanti E. Torreggiani E. Penolazzi L. Gambari R. Piva R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2008; 216: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Two primers were used to detect the DNA segment located at –125/+11 of IL-8 promoter (forward, 5′-ACTCAGGTTTGCCCTGAGGGGA-3′; reverse, 5′-TGCCTTATGGAGTGCTCCGGTG-3′). The PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 4 min and 38 cycles of 94 °C for 50 s, 65 °C for 50 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were separated by 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts, prepared with NE-PER® Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Pierce), were subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the LightShift Chemiluminescent kit (Pierce). The binding reaction mixture containing 3 μg of nuclear extract, 20 fmol of 5′ biotin-labeled oligonucleotide probe(s) (Table 2), 1× binding buffer, 50 ng of poly(dI·dC), 2.5% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mm MgCl2 was incubated at room temperature for 20 min in a final volume of 20 μl. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts were incubated with 2 μg of anti-c-Jun, anti-C/EBPβ, anti-RelA, or anti-NFKB1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at room temperature (for 20 min) prior to probe addition. For competition assays, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides was incubated with the extracts at room temperature for 10 min before probe addition. Bound complexes were separated on 8% polyacrylamide gels, blotted onto membrane, and visualized by autoradiography (Hyperfilm, Fuji, Naples, Italy).TABLE 2DNA probes used for EMSAOligo nameSequence (5′-3′)IL-8-97TCAGTTGCAAATCGTGGAATTTCCTCTGACATAATGAAAAGATMut IL-8-97TCAGCTACGCAGCGTGGAATGTCGTCTGACATAATGAAAAGATNF-κB (IL-8)TCAGCTACGCAGCGTGGAATTTCCTCTGACATAATGAAAAGATC/EBPβ (IL-8)TCAGTTGCAAATCGTGCAATGTCGTCTGACATAATGAAAAGATAP-1 (IL-8)AGTGTGATGACTCAGGTTTGCMut AP-1 (IL-8)AGTGTGATGAGATCGGTTTGC Open table in a new tab Densitometry and Statistical Analysis—The relative intensities of protein and nucleic acid bands were analyzed using the Eastman Kodak Co.

Untreated cells produced small amounts of IL-8, whereas killed P. aeruginosa (50 μg/ml) significantly increased IL-8 in both primary and Chang cells (Fig. 1A). Slightly higher levels were obtained using 300 × 104 colony-forming units of live bacteria (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that P. aeruginosa leads to a release of IL-8 protein in a dose-dependent manner.FIGURE 1Stimulation with P. aeruginosa increases IL-8 production in conjunctival cells.

Untreated Chang and primary cells (Fig. 2, time 0) produced low levels of IL-8 mRNA, whereas the transcript significantly increased after the bacterial stimulation, starting at 3 h and peaking at 4 h. These data indicate that P. aeruginosa increases IL-8 production at the transcriptional level in a time-dependent manner. P. aeruginosa-induced IL-8 Synthesis Is Mediated through IL-8 Promoter Activation—Because the increase of IL-8 protein and mRNA may be post-transcriptionally regulated (32Roebuck K.A. J.

Fig. 3A shows that either killed or live P. aeruginosa significantly activated in Chang cells the IL-8 promoter expression, peaking at 6 h. Given that IL-8 promoter expression is regulated by p38MAPK, NF-κB, and JNK (30Venza I. Cucinotta M. Caristi S. Mancuso G. Teti D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Fig. 3B shows that IL-8 promoter activation induced by P. aeruginosa was significantly reduced by SB203580 and CAPE, inhibitors of p38MAPK and NF-κB, respectively (36Mancuso G. Midiri A. Beninati C.

Cucinotta M. Caristi S. Mancuso G. Teti D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the bacterium was able to phosphorylate p38MAPK, IKBα, and c-Jun. As shown in Fig. 4A, P. aeruginosa induced phosphorylation of p38MAPK after 15 min with a peak at 60 through 180 min. The phosphorylation resulted in the kinase activation because ATF-2, a substrate of p38MAPK, was phosphorylated with the same pattern. As shown in Fig. 4B, C/EBPβ, a transcription factor acting at a specific site on IL-8 promoter, was also phosphorylated, and the specific inhibitor of p38MAPK, SB203580 (34Caristi S. Piraino G. Cucinotta M. Valenti A. Loddo S. Teti D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14433-14442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), was able to abolish the phosphorylation. Moreover the treatment with the bacterium induced IKBα and c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig. 4, C and D) after 15 and 2 min through 240 and 30 min, respectively. The relative specific inhibitors CAPE and SP600125 abolished the P. aeruginosa-induced phosphorylation. Accompanying the increase in IKBα phosphorylation, IKBα degradation was observed 120 min after stimulation and was maximal at 240 min after stimulation (Fig. 4C).FIGURE 4P. aeruginosa induces the phosphorylation of p38MAPK, C/EBPβ, IKBα, and c-Jun in Chang cells. A, Chang cells were treated with P. aeruginosa (50 μg/ml) for the indicated times. Total extracts were loaded onto gels (60 μg of protein/lane) and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using polyclonal antibodies that recognize the phosphorylated forms of p38MAPK (p-p38) and ATF-2 (p-ATF2). B, Chang cells were incubated with P. aeruginosa (50 μg/ml) for the indicated times and where indicated were pretreated for 1 h with the specific inhibitor of p38MAPK, SB203580 (SB) (20 μm). Total cell lysates were treated as described in A and blotted with a phosphospecific C/EBPβ antibody (p-C/EBPβ). C, Chang cells were pretreated for 1 h with the NF-κB inhibitor CAPE (20 μm) where indicated and subsequently incubated with P. aeruginosa (50 μg/ml) for the indicated times. Cytoplasmic extracts were loaded onto gels (60 μg of protein/lane) and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies against phospho-IKBα (p-IKBα) and IKBα.

All the wt plasmids increased the basal luciferase activity, whereas TAM-67 c-Jun decreased the levels of IL-8 expression. RelA and C/EBPβ overexpression significantly up-regulated the P. aeruginosa-induced activation of IL-8 promoter, whereas wt or TAM-67 c-Jun (Fig. 5) and NFKB1 (data not shown) were ineffective.FIGURE 5Effects of the transcription factor overexpression on IL-8 promoter activation following P. aeruginosa infection.

After transfection, Chang cells were treated with 50 μg/ml P. aeruginosa for 6 h, and the IL-8 promoter expression was measured as -fold induction. β-Galactosidase levels were determined for transfection efficiency.

Under optimal conditions (50 nm; 48 h post-transfection) we achieved 95, 90, and 87% knockdown of c-Jun, RelA, and C/EBPβ, respectively (Fig. 6A). The inhibition of RelA and C/EBPβ, but not c-Jun, suppressed the P. aeruginosa-induced IL-8 promoter activity (Fig. 6B) as well as IL-8 protein synthesis (Fig. 6C). Silencing of NFKB1 did not alter IL-8 expression (data not shown). These data provide evidence of the functional role of RelA and C/EBPβ in P. aeruginosa-induced IL-8 gene expression and exclude any involvement of c-Jun.FIGURE 6Silencing of RelA and C/EBPβ, but not c-Jun, suppresses the P. aeruginosa-induced IL-8 transcriptional activation.

https://openalex.org/W2019579574,"Background The chromosome characteristics of the butterfly Bicyclus anynana, have received little attention, despite the scientific importance of this species. This study presents the characterization of chromosomes in this species by means of cytogenetic analysis and linkage mapping. Methodology/Principal Findings Physical genomic features in the butterfly B. anynana were examined by karyotype analysis and construction of a linkage map. Lepidoptera possess a female heterogametic W-Z sex chromosome system. The WZ-bivalent in pachytene oocytes of B. anynana consists of an abnormally small, heterochromatic W-chromosome with the Z-chromosome wrapped around it. Accordingly, the W-body in interphase nuclei is much smaller than usual in Lepidoptera. This suggests an intermediate stage in the process of secondary loss of the W-chromosome to a ZZ/Z sex determination system. Two nucleoli are present in the pachytene stage associated with an autosome and the WZ-bivalent respectively. Chromosome counts confirmed a haploid number of n = 28. Linkage mapping had to take account of absence of crossing-over in females, and of our use of a full-sib crossing design. We developed a new method to determine and exclude the non-recombinant uninformative female inherited component in offspring. The linkage map was constructed using a novel approach that uses exclusively JOINMAP-software for Lepidoptera linkage mapping. This approach simplifies the mapping procedure, avoids over-estimation of mapping distance and increases the reliability of relative marker positions. A total of 347 AFLP markers, 9 microsatellites and one single-copy nuclear gene covered all 28 chromosomes, with a mapping distance of 1354 cM. Conserved synteny of Tpi on the Z-chromosome in Lepidoptera was confirmed for B. anynana. The results are discussed in relation to other mapping studies in Lepidoptera. Conclusions/Significance This study adds to the knowledge of chromosome structure and evolution of an intensively studied organism. On a broader scale it provides an insight in Lepidoptera sex chromosome evolution and it proposes a simpler and more reliable method of linkage mapping than used for Lepidoptera to date."
https://openalex.org/W2044694782,"Fibronectin (FN) matrix is crucial for cell and tissue functions during embryonic development, wound healing, and oncogenesis. Assembly of FN matrix fibrils requires FN domains that mediate interactions with integrin receptors and with other FN molecules. In addition, regulation of FN matrix assembly depends on the first two FN type III modules, III1 and III2, which harbor FN-binding sites. We propose that interactions between these two modules sequester FN-binding sites in soluble FN and that these sites become exposed by FN conformational changes during assembly. To test the idea that III1–2 has a compact conformation, we constructed CIIIY, a conformational sensor of III1–2 based on fluorescent resonance energy transfer between cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins conjugated at its N and C termini. We demonstrate energy transfer in CIIIY and show that fluorescent resonance energy transfer was eliminated by proteolysis and by treatment with mild denaturants that disrupted intramolecular interactions between the two modules. We also show that mutations of key charged residues resulted in conformational changes that exposed binding sites for the N-terminal 70-kDa FN fragment. Collectively, these results support a conformation-dependent mechanism for the regulation of FN matrix assembly by III1–2.

It exists in the blood and other body fluids as a soluble compact molecule and undergoes cell-mediated assembly to form an insoluble three-dimensional fibrillar matrix (reviewed in Ref. 1Mao Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. Matrix Biol.. 2005; 24: 389-399Google Scholar). The process of FN matrix assembly has been implicated in embryonic development, wound healing, and cancer (2Ghosh K. Ren X.D. Shu X.Z. Prestwich G.D. Clark R.A. Tissue Eng.. 2006; 12: 601-613Google Scholar, 3Honest H. Bachmann L.M. Gupta J.K. Kleijnen J. Khan K.S. Br. Med. J.. 2002; 325: 301Google Scholar, 4Santimaria M.

FN is composed of type I–III modules, and sets of these modules comprise binding domains for cells and for other extracellular matrix components (see Fig. 1A). Three of these binding domains are essential for matrix assembly (1Mao Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. Matrix Biol.. 2005; 24: 389-399Google Scholar). Integrin receptor interactions with the cell-binding domain tether disulfide-bonded FN dimers to the cell surface, where FN-FN interactions involving the N-terminal assembly domain form dimers into fibrils. In addition to these essential domains, other FN-binding sites have been implicated in assembly. In particular, the III1–2 FN-binding domain plays a regulatory role in matrix assembly. Within this domain reside a cryptic FN-binding site in III1 and a site available for FN binding in the native form of III2 (5Aguirre K.M. McCormick R.J. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem.. 1994; 269: 27863-27868Google Scholar, 6Hocking D.C. Sottile J. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 1994; 269: 19183-19187Google Scholar, 7Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Huff S. Litvinovich S.V. J. Biol.

Recombinant FN lacking III1 is assembled into a matrix at wild-type levels, but that lacking the III1–2 domain results in short immature FN fibrils (8Sechler J.L. Rao H. Cumiskey A.M. Vega-Colon I. Smith M.S. Murata T. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol.. 2001; 154: 1081-1088Google Scholar). Peptides derived from the III1–2 domain or antibodies against III1–2 block matrix assembly by cultured cells (9Chernousov M.A. Faerman A.I. Frid M.G. Printseva O.Y. Koteliansky V.E. FEBS Lett.. 1987; 217: 124-128Google Scholar, 10Chernousov M.A. Fogerty F.J. Koteliansky V.E. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem.. 1991; 266: 10851-10858Google Scholar, 11Morla A. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol.. 1992; 118: 421-429Google Scholar). Furthermore, FN binding to this region is enhanced when FN is mechanically stretched (12Zhong C. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Brown J. Shaub A. Belkin A.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol.. 1998; 141: 539-551Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that conformational changes in the III1–2 domain may control its interactions during FN assembly. To more fully understand the roles of native and cryptic FN-binding sites in matrix assembly, the conformational dynamics of III1–2 must be characterized. One approach to this problem is to tag III1–2 with fluorescent probes, which, in conjunction with fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET), create a molecular conformational sensor. FRET involves the radiationless transfer of energy from an excited donor fluorophore to an acceptor fluorophore, a process that is very sensitive to the distance between the two fluorophores (13Miyawaki A. Dev. Cell.. 2003; 4: 295-305Google Scholar, 14Miyawaki A. Sawano A. Kogure T. Nat. Cell Biol.. 2003; 5: S1-S7Google Scholar, 15Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 1998; 67: 509-544Google Scholar). Two fluorescent protein variants, cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), are highly related to green fluorescent protein (GFP). Because the emission spectrum of CFP is well matched to the excitation spectrum of YFP, these two fluorophores have been widely used as a donor-acceptor pair in FRET studies (13Miyawaki A. Dev. Cell.. 2003; 4: 295-305Google Scholar, 14Miyawaki A. Sawano A. Kogure T. Nat. Cell Biol.. 2003; 5: S1-S7Google Scholar, 15Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 1998; 67: 509-544Google Scholar). In this study, we describe a FRET conformational sensor designed to test the idea that intramolecular interactions between III1 and III2 sequester key FN-binding and assembly sites. We show that III1–2 with CFP and YFP fused to the N and C termini, respectively, displays a clear FRET signal, indicating that the attached fluorescent proteins and thus the ends of III1–2 are in close proximity. FRET data from III1–2 mutants support the presence of a stabilizing intermodule salt bridge that regulates FN-binding activity. Production and Purification of CFP/YFP Fusion Proteins and SDS-PAGE—The enhanced CFP gene (pECFP, Clontech, Mountain View, CA) with a Gly-Ser-Gly-Ser-Gly coding sequence at the 3′-end and BamHI and BglII restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, was generated by PCR and cloned into the pGEM vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate pGEM-CFP. The CFP BamHI-BglII fragment of pGEM-CFP was inserted into the BamHI site of pGEX-6P-2 (GE Healthcare) upstream of human III1–2 to generate the donor-only construct CFP-III1–2 in pGEX or CIII. The gene expressing III1–2-YFP with BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, was created by overlap extension PCR. Overlap PCR consisted of a first PCR with primers flanking the termini of the FN III1–2 domain in pGEX-6P-2 but excluding the stop codon at the 3′-end and primers flanking YFP in pEYFP (Clontech) including the YFP stop codon. The second PCR used the two PCR products from the first reaction and the aforementioned 5′-primer of the III1–2 domain and the 3′-primer of pEYFP. The final PCR product was cloned into the pGEM vector to generate pGEM-YFP, which was subsequently cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-6P-2 to generate the acceptor-only gene, III1–2-YFP or IIIY. The donor-acceptor construct, CFP-III1–2-YFP or CIIIY, was created by ligating the BamHI-CFP-BglII fragment from pGEM-CFP to the BamHI site of the acceptor-only construct IIIY. All of the constructs were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in Escherichia coli DH12α. Mutants CIIIYK669A and CIIIYD767A, with alanine substitutions at FN residues Lys669 and Asp767, were created in a similar manner using mutant III1–2 constructs kindly provided by Dr. Iain Campbell (Oxford University). Mutant CIIIY in which both Lys669 and Asp767 were mutated to alanine (CIIIYK669A/D767A) was created by overlap extension using primers overlapping the single mutations in mutant III1–2 domains. Mutant CIIIYK672A was created by PCR with primers overlapping the mutation site and incorporating the coding sequence for the mutated residue. To create CIIIYK672A/D767A, we ligated pGEX-6P-2-CIIIYK672A at the BamHI and StuI sites and inserted this mutant fragment into the pGEX-6P-2-CIIIYD767A fragment ligated at the BamHI and StuI sites. Overlap PCR with primers corresponding to the Lys669 and Lys672 genes and Asp767 were used to create the pGEX-6P-2-CIIIYK669A/K672A/D767A triple mutant. The proteins were then purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer's specifications. High concentration fractions were dialyzed into 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Following dialysis, Precision protease (GE Healthcare) was used to cleave off GST, which was then separated from III1–2-containing proteins by affinity chromatography. Proteins were dialyzed into 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA; flash frozen; and stored at –80 °C. Prior to use, the fusion proteins were thawed at 4 °C and spun at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. The GFP and FN epitopes were immunodetected using mouse monoclonal antibodies JL-8 (BD Biosciences) and 5E6, respectively. JL-8 recognizes GFP and its variants such as CFP and YFP. Monoclonal antibody 5E6 was raised against a GST-III1–2 fusion protein and is specific for human III1–2. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies. Hybridoma culture supernatant containing antibody 5E6 was used at 1:100 dilution. Antibody JL-8 was diluted 1:2000 according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce) was used at a dilution of 1:10,000. Antibodies were detected with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent reagents (Pierce). Circular Dichroism Studies—CD spectra in the far-UV region (between 200 and 260 nm) were obtained using a J720 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Easton, MD) in a 0.1-cm path length and at a temperature of 20 °C. A bandwidth of 2 nm and a scan rate of 50 nm/min were used. The ellipticities of III1–2 and CIIIY were measured at concentrations of 3.5–5.0 μm in phosphate-buffered saline and in the presence of 0.5 and 2 m guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) in phosphate-buffered saline. Absorption spectra were collected in the range of 200–260 nm and converted to molar ellipticity, [θ], which is expressed in degrees/cm2/dmol. Three scans were averaged for each individual sample. FRET Measurements—Prior to FRET analysis, CFP/YFP fusion proteins were diluted to 100 nm in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA. Protein concentrations were determined and matched using the BCA protein assay (Pierce), the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), optical density readings at 280 nm, and comparison of band intensities by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining. In vitro FRET measurements were carried out in a PTI photon-counting spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, Birmingham, NJ) equipped with a temperature-jacketed cuvette holder at 25 °C. Prior to sample analysis, the proteins were thawed and kept at 4 °C. Sample analysis was done by placing the protein solutions in a cuvette with a 1-cm path length, placing the cuvette in the holder, and equilibrating the protein solution to ambient temperature. An excitation wavelength of 433 nm was used for the FRET studies, and the steady-state emission profiles between 460 and 540 nm were determined by collecting the raw emission in duplicate, obtaining an average, and subtracting buffer emission. Fluorescence emission was monitored under a variety of conditions. Steady-state and time course emissions at 475 and 525 nm, the CFP and YFP peaks, were monitored with 433 nm excitation of the FRET probes in the absence and presence of 3.2 μg of α-chymotrypsin (Sigma). As controls, emissions at 475 and 525 nm for CIII and IIIY, respectively, were monitored after protease addition and excitation at 433 nm for CIII and at 433 or 513 nm for IIIY. To analyze protease products, fusion proteins were cleaved with α-chymotrypsin for 100 s using the same mass ratio of protease to protein. Proteolysis was stopped with 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). The products of proteolysis were separated on a polyacrylamide gel and analyzed via immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibodies as described above. Sizes of cleavage products were determined from a plot of log molecular mass versus distance migrated relative to molecular mass markers. Steady-state emission profiles of CIIIY and controls were obtained in the absence and presence of GdmCl at concentrations of 0.5 and 2 m. Emission of CIIIY and its mutants at 475 and 525 nm was monitored during excitation at 433 nm in the absence and presence of 1.7 μm N-terminal 70-kDa FN fragment using the following procedure. Emission spectra at 475 and 525 nm were collected at intervals of 1 s. After 20 s, the 70-kDa fragment was added to the cuvette, and emissions were continually monitored for 30 min, sufficient time for binding and conformational changes. Time-averaged emission data for the 15 s before the addition of the 70-kDa fragment and for the 15 s at 30 min of incubation were used to calculate initial and final FRET efficiencies. FRET efficiencies were calculated from donor peak emissions in the presence and absence of the 70-kDa fragment. FRET efficiencies were calculated from the donor-side emission of intact and proteolytically cleaved samples (16Epe B. Steinhauser K.G. Woolley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1983; 80: 2579-2583Google Scholar). The FRET efficiency (E) is given in Equation 1, E=1−DDA(Eq. 1) where D and DA are the values of the CFP emission peak in the donor-acceptor protein before and after cleavage, respectively. Modeling of III1–2 Conformation—An existing model of III1–2 deposited into the Protein Data Bank (code 2HA1) by Vakonakis et al. (17Vakonakis I. Staunton D. Rooney L.M. Campbell I.D. EMBO J.. 2007; 26: 2575-2583Google Scholar) was altered to accommodate the FRET data. The Protein Data Bank file was modified to position Lys672 and Asp767 near each other as would occur in a salt bridge. In an alternative model, III2 was reoriented ∼180° with respect to III1 while maintaining the Lys672-Asp767 interaction. Only the lysine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid residues were moved as rotamers, and gross packing errors were avoided. Design and Characterization of a FRET Conformational Sensor—Fibronectin in solution has a compact conformation (18Johnson K.J. Sage H. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem.. 1999; 274: 15473-15479Google Scholar) but is converted into an extended form that participates in FN-FN interactions during fibril formation. We propose that, in soluble FN, III1 and III2 interact to sequester FN-binding sites that become exposed during FN extension and fibril assembly. A simplified model of how the conformation of III1–2 may influence access to FN-binding sites is shown in Fig. 1B and is based on the following properties of III1–2. FN type III repeats are β-barrel structures with a long axis of 35–40 Å and a lateral width of ∼20 Å (19Briknarova K. Akerman M.E. Hoyt D.W. Ruoslahti E. Ely K.R. J. Mol. Biol.. 2003; 332: 205-215Google Scholar, 20Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell.. 1996; 84: 155-164Google Scholar). The isoelectric points for III1 and III2 are 9.45 and 3.79, respectively, suggesting the possibility that these modules may associate through electrostatic interactions. There is a 17-amino acid linker between III1 and III2 with the sequence STSTPVTSNTVTGETTP; the abundance of serine and threonine residues is characteristic of a flexible polypeptide chain (21Argos P. J. Mol. Biol.. 1990; 211: 943-958Google Scholar). The contour length of a linear form of the backbone carbon atoms of the linker is ∼50 Å, which is long enough to allow the two modules to interact. As proposed by our model, intramolecular interactions give III1–2 a compact conformation within which FN-binding sites are sequestered (Fig. 1B, panel i). Conformational changes, perhaps induced by cell-derived tension (12Zhong C. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Brown J. Shaub A. Belkin A.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol.. 1998; 141: 539-551Google Scholar, 22Ohashi T. Kiehart D.P. Erickson H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1999; 96: 2153-2158Google Scholar), could open up the domain and expose the FN-binding sites (Fig. 1B, panel ii). This model predicts that the N terminus of III1 and the C terminus of III2 are close together in solution. To investigate this possibility, we developed a FRET-based conformational sensor. CFP and YFP were conjugated at the N and C termini of III1–2, respectively, to create CIIIY (Fig. 1C). We employed a -GSGSG- spacer between the FN modules and the fluorophores to provide a flexible connection between the fluorophores and the III1–2 domain and to impart rotational mobility (23Prescott M. Nowakowski S. Nagley P. Devenish R.J. Anal. Biochem.. 1999; 273: 305-307Google Scholar, 24Zhang B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2004; 323: 674-678Google Scholar). Considering the dimensions of type III modules, a distance estimate between N and C termini in this model is ∼50 Å. The distance at which 50% of CFP energy is transferred to YFP, known as the Förster distance, is ∼50 Å (25Patterson G.H. Piston D.W. Barisas B.G. Anal. Biochem.. 2000; 284: 438-440Google Scholar). The spectrofluorometer used in this study is capable of robustly measuring FRET efficiencies equal to or greater than 5%, which corresponds to a distance of 80 Å or less between the donor and acceptor fluorophores. Therefore, the distance between termini in our model is within the distance requirement for FRET to occur and be detected in CIIIY. In addition to the doubly labeled CIIIY protein, we also created a CIII donor-only variant with CFP conjugated to the N terminus of III1–2 and a IIIY acceptor-only variant with YFP conjugated to the C terminus. Purified fusion proteins were characterized by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies specific to either the III1–2 or GFP moiety. FN and GFP epitopes were present in CIIIY, CIII, and IIIY, and all fusion proteins were of the expected sizes (Fig. 2A). Solid-phase binding assays showed that the N-terminal 70-kDa FN fragment bound similarly to immobilized CIIIY and III1–2 (supplemental Fig. 1), indicating that FN binding was not perturbed by the addition of CFP and YFP. The secondary structures of FN type III modules and of CFP and YFP are primarily β-sheet. In CD studies, CIIIY and III1–2 were both characterized by a prominent negative peak at 215 nm, indicative of a β-sheet (Fig. 2B). The coincidence of the absorption peaks at 215 nm shows that CIIIY and III1–2 have similar secondary structures. However, CIIIY has a peak value of –6.12 × 103 degrees/cm2/dmol, which is much larger than the III1–2 peak at –1.80 × 103 degrees/cm2/dmol (Fig. 2B). At 215 nm, the ellipticity of GFP, which has very similar secondary structure to CFP and YFP (26Zimmer M. Chem. Rev.. 2002; 102: 759-781Google Scholar), is approximately –7.14 × 103 degrees/cm2/dmol (27Visser N.V. Hink M.A. Borst J.W. van der Krogt G.N. Visser A.J. FEBS Lett.. 2002; 521: 31-35Google Scholar). A linear combination of the 215 nm absorption spectra of two GFP molecules and III1–2 gives a molar ellipticity of –5.54 × 103 degrees/cm2/dmol, which is comparable with our experimental value for CIIIY. Thus, the secondary structure of CIIIY does not vary significantly from its constituents CFP, YFP, and III1–2. There is a secondary minimum at 230 nm in the trace for III1–2, which does not correspond to known secondary structure profiles. This secondary minimum may be due to an unstructured domain such as the flexible linker that may be masked by the contributions from CFP and YFP in the CIIIY spectrum. Intramolecular FRET in CIIIY—Fluorescence spectroscopy studies of CIIIY demonstrated a strong FRET signal between the CFP and YFP moieties. CFP excitation in CIIIY resulted in emission peaks at 475 and 525 nm (Fig. 3A), corresponding to CFP and YFP emission peaks, respectively. The detection of sensitized YFP emission upon excitation at 433 nm strongly suggests that the CFP and YFP probes in the CIIIY construct are sufficiently close together for FRET. To validate this finding, we employed several strategies designed to disrupt the close proximity of the FRET probes. Proteolytic sites for α-chymotrypsin exist in III1–2 (11Morla A. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol.. 1992; 118: 421-429Google Scholar), whereas the CFP/YFP fluorophores are resistant to protease digestion (reviewed in Ref. 26Zimmer M. Chem. Rev.. 2002; 102: 759-781Google Scholar). The addition of α-chymotrypsin to CIIIY resulted in a dramatic loss of sensitized YFP emission and a dequenching of the CFP emission indicated by increased peak height at 475 nm (Fig. 3A). These changes are highly consistent with efficient energy transfer in the intact CIIIY molecule. The transfer efficiency in intact CIIIY, calculated using Equation 1 (see “Experimental Procedures”), gives a FRET efficiency of 0.10 in CIIIY. A similar value of FRET efficiency was obtained using 10 and 50 nm solutions of CIIIY, indicating that FRET efficiency was independent of protein concentration (data not shown). Because GFP fluorescence is sensitive to changes in the environment (26Zimmer M. Chem. Rev.. 2002; 102: 759-781Google Scholar), which may change with time during proteolysis, we examined how fluorescence emission in CIIIY and in the controls changed with time during proteolysis. Time course analysis of CIIIY proteolysis confirmed a decrease in FRET efficiency with increasing cleavage time in the presence of the protease (Fig. 3B). After protease addition to control proteins, the 475 nm emission peak intensity of the donor-only CIII and the 525 nm peak emission intensity of IIIY after 433 nm excitation did not change (Fig. 3C), confirming their resistance to cleavage. We also observed no difference in the acceptor peak intensity in IIIY when directly exciting YFP at 513 nm (data not shown). Proteolytic products were examined after 100 s, the time it took to eliminate FRET in Fig. 3B. Immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibodies identified proteolytic fragments with molecular masses of 37 and 27 kDa (Fig. 3D). CIIIY cleavage products correspond to fragments generated by cleavage of the donor-only (CIII) and acceptor-only (IIIY) proteins. No fragments smaller than 27 kDa were detected. The 27-kDa fragment is approximately the size of CFP or YFP, suggesting cleavage at the interface between III1–2 and the fluorophore, whereas the 37-kDa fragment contains fluorophore and a portion of III1–2. Therefore, the loss of FRET and the increased distance between the donor and acceptor fluorophores result from CIIIY proteolysis. These results demonstrate the presence of intramolecular FRET in intact CIIIY. In a second strategy, we treated CIIIY with GdmCl because this denaturant has been shown to disrupt intramolecular interactions and gradually transform full-length FN from a compact to an extended conformation (28Khan M.Y. Medow M.S. Newman S.A. Biochem. J.. 1990; 270: 33-38Google Scholar). In 2 m GdmCl, fluorescence emission and CD spectroscopy showed FN in an extended conformation, but the secondary structure within its modules remained intact (28Khan M.Y. Medow M.S. Newman S.A. Biochem. J.. 1990; 270: 33-38Google Scholar). On the other hand, GFP fluorophores are stable and fluorescent at concentrations of GdmCl up to 6 m (29Tsumoto K. Umetsu M. Kumagai I. Ejima D. Arakawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2003; 312: 1383-1386Google Scholar). We monitored the effect of 0.5 and 2 m GdmCl on FRET in CIIIY. The emission of CIIIY in 0.5 m GdmCl was characterized by a reduction of the YFP emission peak compared with its emission in a nondenaturing solution (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, the CD spectra of CIIIY and III1–2 in 0.5 m GdmCl were comparable with those in a nondenaturing solution (Fig. 4, B and C), indicating that the secondary structure of III1–2 was not perturbed by 0.5 m GdmCl. When the concentration of GdmCl was increased from 0.5 to 2 m, the YFP emission peak was eliminated from the emission spectra of CIIIY excited at 433 nm (Fig. 4A). The CD spectra of CIIIY and III1–2 in 2 m GdmCl were distinct from those in 0.5 m GdmCl (Fig. 4, B and C) and were marked by a shift in the minima to lower wavelengths, reflecting a loss of β-sheet structure. The maintenance of β-sheet structure with the loss of FRET in the 0.5 m GdmCl environment confirms the disruption of intramolecular interactions between the FN modules in III1–2. These CD and FRET studies in the absence and presence of varying denaturant concentrations are indicative of III1–2 structural transitions in the different environments: a compact III1–2 domain in the absence of denaturant, a partially open III1–2 domain with intact secondary structure in the FN modules in 0.5 m GdmCl, and a fully open III1–2 domain with some loss of secondary structure in 2 m GdmCl. Mutations in III1–2 Influence FRET and FN Binding—The conformation of III1–2 is proposed to be stabilized by a salt bridge between Lys669 in III1 and Asp767 in III2 (17Vakonakis I. Staunton D. Rooney L.M. Campbell I.D. EMBO J.. 2007; 26: 2575-2583Google Scholar). We used FRET to probe the conformation of CIIIY mutants with alanine residues in place of Lys669 and Asp767 (CIIIYK669A/D767A). FRET in CIIIYK669A/D767A was characterized by an increase in the acceptor peak of the donor normalized data or the IA/ID value (Fig. 5A), indicating that the N and C termini are closer together in the mutant. A time course analysis of changes in FRET efficiency in CIIIYK669A/D767A in the presence of α-chymotrypsin confirmed the presence of intramolecular FRET (Fig. 5B). Intact CIIIYK669A/D767A had a higher FRET efficiency than intact CIIIY (0.19 versus 0.10). Furthermore, the effect of α-chymotrypsin on CIIIYK669A/D767A was similar to its effect on CIIIY, causing a 50% reduction in FRET efficiency within 30 s of protease addition (see Fig. 3B). Thus, the rates of proteolysis in CIIIY and CIIIYK669A/D767A were comparable, suggesting that the mutations did not cause any major structural changes. However, the increase in FRET efficiency from 0.10 in CIIIY to 0.19 in CIIIYK669A/D767A strongly supports the conclusion that one or both of these mutations induce subtle conformational changes in III1–2 that reduce the distance between the N and C termini. Analysis of the single mutant CIIIYD767A showed acceptor emission similar to that of CIIIYK669A/D767A as represented by the acceptor peak enhancement of the donor normalized data IA/ID (Fig. 5C). In contrast, the emission profile of CIIIYK669A was comparable with that of wild-type CIIIY. Thus, mutation of Asp767 impacted III1–2 conformation, whereas the K669A mutation did not. Furthermore, the single mutant results show that the increased FRET efficiency of CIIIYK669A/D767A (Fig. 5, A and B) is due to D767A. Examination of III1–2 sequence alignment from different species shows a highly conserved Lys672 residue (17Vakonakis I. Staunton D. Rooney L.M. Campbell I.D. EMBO J.. 2007; 26: 2575-2583Google Scholar). A CIIIY FRET probe containing K672A had a significant increase in the IA/ID value, comparable with that observed in CIIIYD767A (Fig. 5C). The similarity in FRET changes with mutation of either Lys672 or Asp767 strongly suggests that these two residues are associated in CIIIY. This interpretation is further supported by the triple mutant CIIIYK669A/K672A/D767A, which also had increased FRET compared with CIIIY and CIIIYK669A. The double mutant CIIIYK672A/D767A displayed a FRET efficiency that was similar to that of CIIIYD767A (∼0.18) (Fig. 5D). However, its IA/ID value was comparable with that of CIIIY (Fig. 5C). FRET efficiencies are evaluated from the donor side, and the high efficiency in CIIIYK672A/D767A supports a conformational change similar to that of the single mutant. The low IA/ID value for the double mutant suggests that there may be an unidentified defect in the acceptor fluorophore. Nonetheless, the increased FRET efficiency in CIIIYK672A/D767A, as well as the increases in acceptor emission in either single mutant and in CIIIYK669A/K672A/D767A, supports an interaction between Lys672 and Asp767 in III1–2. To determine whether the conformational differences that increase the FRET signal affect the FN-binding activity of III1–2, we examined the emissions of CIIIY and its mutants in the presence and absence of the N-terminal 70-kDa FN-binding fragment (see Fig. 1A). Mutation of Asp767 alone or in combination with Lys672 induced significant increases in FRET efficiencies similar to CIIIYK669A/D767A (Fig. 5D). The addition of the 70-kDa fragment led to a significant loss of FRET efficiency in CIIIYD767A, CIIIYK669A/D767A, and CIIIYK672A/D767A but had no significant effect on the FRET signal in CIIIY and CIIIYK669A (Fig. 5D). In the presence of the 70-kDa fragment, the FRET efficiencies of CIIIYD767A, CIIIYK669A/ D767A, and CIIIYK672A/D767A decreased by ∼55, 60, and 40%, respectively. Increases in FRET efficiency with mutation of Lys672, Asp767, or both support the conclusion that these two residues interact via a salt bridge in CIIIY and that disruption of this salt bridge induces conformational changes in III1–2. The changes in FRET induced by the 70-kDa fragment suggest that the mutations expose a FN-binding site in III1–2 and that binding to this site induces further conformational changes. No changes were observed with CIIIYK669A, further indicating that this residue is not directly involved in these intermodule interactions. The III1–2 domain of FN, containing two FN-binding sites, plays a regulatory role in matrix assembly. Using a FRET-based sensor of structural dynamics, we have shown here that opposite ends of III1–2 are in close proximity rather than extended in opposite directions, as are other type III module pairs (30Campbell I.D. Spitzfaden C. Structure.. 1994; 2: 333-337Google Scholar). The compact conformation of III1–2 was disrupted by mild denaturation that separated N and C termini but did not perturb the β-barrel secondary structures of the individual modules. The conformation of CIIIY was also altered by mutation of Lys672 in III1 or Asp767 in III2. Binding of the 70-kDa FN matrix assembly fragment to mutant CIIIY caused a dramatic reduction in FRET, demonstrating that FN-FN interactions affect the conformation of the III1–2 domain. These results provide new insights into the distance between the ends of III1–2 and the nature of intramolecular interactions in this domain that keep it in a compact state. We have used GFP-based FRET spectroscopy to assign a distance limit between the two fluorophores and to get an estimate of the distance between the N and C termini of III1–2. FRET efficiency depends on the orientation of the CFP and YFP fluorophores with respect to each other. Although the precise orientation of the two fluorophores is unknown, it is possible to obtain an upper limit of the distance between them from the Förster distance of the FRET pair (31Lakowicz J. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Springer-Verlag New York Inc, New York2006Crossref Scopus (17591) Google Scholar). A FRET efficiency of 0.10 in CIIIY corresponds to a distance between CFP and YFP that is 70 Å or less. A model of III1–2 based on NMR solution structures of the individual modules, III1 (19Briknarova K. Akerman M.E. Hoyt D.W. Ruoslahti E. Ely K.R. J. Mol. Biol.. 2003; 332: 205-215Google Scholar, 32Gao M. Craig D. Lequin O. Campbell I.D. Vogel V. Schulten K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2003; 100: 14784-14789Google Scholar) and III2 (17Vakonakis I. Staunton D. Rooney L.M. Campbell I.D. EMBO J.. 2007; 26: 2575-2583Google Scholar), predicts a distance of 60 Å between the N and C termini (17Vakonakis I. Staunton D. Rooney L.M. Campbell I.D. EMBO J.. 2007; 26: 2575-2583Google Scholar), comparable with the estimate from our FRET analyses. Thus, these two independent approaches are in agreement with regard to a compact conformation of III1–2. A salt bridge between Lys669 in III1 and Asp767 in III2 has been proposed by Vakonakis et al. (17Vakonakis I. Staunton D. Rooney L.M. Campbell I.D. EMBO J.. 2007; 26: 2575-2583Google Scholar). However, the interaction between III1 and III2 was not disrupted in their K669A mutant compared with the native protein. On the other hand, a D767A mutation perturbed interactions between III1 and III2 (17Vakonakis I. Staunton D. Rooney L.M. Campbell I.D. EMBO J.. 2007; 26: 2575-2583Google Scholar). We have also found, using FRET analyses, that replacement of Asp767 with alanine had a significant effect on III1–2 conformation and on binding to the 70-kDa FN fragment. In contrast, K669A had no effect on either conformation or 70-kDa fragment binding. With D767A, we detected a 10-Å decrease in the distance between N and C termini. Interestingly, similar changes in the distance between the domain ends and in 70-kDa fragment binding were obtained with the K672A mutation. The effects on III1–2 conformation and FN binding of K672A and D767A, but not K669A, indicate that Lys672 and Asp767 play similar roles in positioning N and C termini relative to each other and suggest that these two residues form a salt bridge. These FRET data provide independent measures of the distance between the ends of III1–2 and the residues that are significant in module interactions. This information can be combined with existing structural models to provide insights into III1–2 conformation. Working with a published model (17Vakonakis I. Staunton D. Rooney L.M. Campbell I.D. EMBO J.. 2007; 26: 2575-2583Google Scholar), we propose two possible III1–2 conformations. In both models, a Lys672-Asp767 salt bridge has a pivotal role, and a compact III1–2 conformation is maintained. The major difference is in the orientations of III2 relative to III1. The first model shown in Fig. 6A is similar to that of Vakonakis et al. (17Vakonakis I. Staunton D. Rooney L.M. Campbell I.D. EMBO J.. 2007; 26: 2575-2583Google Scholar), with N and C termini extended in opposite directions but with III2 shifted somewhat to facilitate a Lys672-Asp767 interaction. In the second model, the orientation of the modules has been changed. III2 was rotated 180° relative to its position in Fig. 6A using Lys672-Asp767 as a pivot; N and C termini point in approximately the same direction in this model (Fig. 6B). The positions of the flexible linker region are quite different between the two models. However, there is overlap in the residues that constitute the III1-III2 intermodule interface, and Lys669 is in the vicinity of acidic residues in III2 in both orientations. These models provide a framework for further structural and mutational analyses to determine the exact interactions between these modules. The interaction of the 70-kDa fragment with the D767A single and double mutants leads to an increase in the distance between the N and C termini of III1–2. This finding confirms an interaction between the matrix assembly domain of FN and III1–2. As III1–2 has both native and cryptic FN-binding sites, this change in conformation may result in exposure of another binding site for FN or for other extracellular matrix components in III1–2. The III1–2 domain has been implicated in formation of stable detergent-insoluble FN fibrils. The regulated exposure of binding sites through 70-kDa fragment binding may be critical for development of stable matrix. Moreover, the potential to bind to more than one FN molecule raises the possibility that III1–2 may act as a branching point for new FN fibrils. We appreciate the useful discussions with Drs. Iain Campbell, David Staunton, and Ioannis Vakonakis. We thank Dr. Mike Ackerman for help with the CD studies and Dr. Phillip Jeffrey for the contribution to structural insights into III1–2.

https://openalex.org/W2091895182,"The majority of studies concerning malaria host genetics have focused on individual genes that confer protection against rather than susceptibility to malaria. Establishing the relative impact of genetic versus non-genetic factors on malaria infection and disease is essential to focus effort on key determinant factors. This relative contribution has rarely been evaluated for Plasmodium falciparum and almost never for Plasmodium vivax. We conducted a longitudinal cohort study in a Karen population of 3,484 individuals in a region of mesoendemic malaria, Thailand from 1998 to 2005. The number of P. falciparum and P. vivax clinical cases and the parasite density per person were determined. Statistical analyses were performed to account for the influence of environmental factors and the genetic heritability of the phenotypes was calculated using the pedigree-based variance components model. The genetic contribution to the number of clinical episodes resulting from P. falciparum and P. vivax were 10% and 19% respectively. There was also moderate genetic contribution to the maximum and overall parasite trophozoite density phenotypes for both P. falciparum (16%&16%) and P. vivax (15%&13%). These values, for P. falciparum, were similar to those previously observed in a region of much higher transmission intensity in Senegal, West Africa. Although environmental factors play an important role in acquiring an infection, genetics plays a determinant role in the outcome of an infection with either malaria parasite species prior to the development of immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2032306277,"T-killer cells eliminate infected and cancerous cells with precision by positioning their centrosome near the interface (immunological synapse) with the target cell. The mechanism of centrosome positioning has remained controversial, in particular the role of microtubule dynamics in it. We re-examined the issue in the experimental model of Jurkat cells presented with a T cell receptor-binding artificial substrate, which permits controlled stimulation and reproducible measurements. Neither 1-µM taxol nor 100-nM nocodazole inhibited the centrosome positioning at the “synapse” with the biomimetic substrate. At the same time, in micromolar taxol but not in nanomolar nocodazole the centrosome adopted a distinct peripheral rather than the normally central position within the synapse. This effect was reproduced in a computational energy-minimization model that assumed no microtubule dynamics, but only a taxol-induced increase in the length of the microtubules. Together, the experimental and computational results indicate that microtubule dynamics are not essential for the centrosome positioning, but that the fit of the microtubule array in the deformed body of the conjugated T cell is a major factor. The possibility of modulating the T-cell centrosome position with well-studied drugs and of predicting their effects in silico appears attractive for designing anti-cancer and antiviral therapies."

Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol.. 2003; 21: 335-376Google Scholar). Thirteen members of the TLR family have been identified in mammals. TLRs have leucine-rich-repeats in their extracellular domains and a Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) in their cytoplasmic domains, the latter of which mainly mediates intracellular signaling. Signaling pathways of TLRs, except for TLR3, depend on an adapter protein, MyD88 (myeloid differentiation factor 88), which interacts with the TIR domain of TLRs. This pathway leads to the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and production of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6. Another important signaling pathway mediated by TLR3 and TLR4 that exploits the TIR domain is the MyD88-independent pathway. This pathway involves different adapter proteins, such as the TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-β (TRIF) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (2Hoebe K. Du X. Georgel P. Janssen E.

TLRs recognize as ligands several microbial pathogen-associated molecular patterns. One such pathogen-associated molecular pattern is lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is recognized by TLR4. LPS triggers severe immunologic reactions by the host in Gram-negative bacterial infections and has drawn attention in many clinical situations. TLR4 is the first mammalian TLR to be discovered in the context of immunology. TLR4 was identified in the search for the genes responsible for LPS hyporesponsiveness (5Qureshi S.T. Lariviere L. Leveque G. Clermont S. Moore K.J. Gros P. Malo D. J. Exp. Med.. 1999; 189: 615-625Google Scholar, 6Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science.. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Google Scholar). The defect was found to stem from a single amino acid mutation, replacement of proline with histidine at position 712, in the cytoplasmic tail of murine TLR4. The study led to the discovery of the importance of TLR4 in innate immunity. A variety of cells are activated by LPS stimulation through TLR4. TLR4 forms a receptor complex with an accessory protein, myeloid differentiation-2 (MD-2). MD-2 first associates with TLR4 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cis-Golgi, and both proteins move together to the plasma membrane (7Visintin A. Mazzoni A. Spitzer J.A. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2001; 98: 12156-12161Google Scholar, 8Nishitani C. Mitsuzawa H. Hyakushima N. Sano H. Matsushima N. Kuroki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2005; 328: 586-590Google Scholar). Upon recognition of LPS, the TLR4·MD-2 complex receives LPS on the cell surface and initiates intracellular signaling. The expression of TLR4 in the absence of MD-2 does not confer full responsiveness to LPS stimuli in experimental cell lines (9Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med.. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Google Scholar). An analysis of MD-2 knockout mice revealed that MD-2 is important not only for LPS sensing but also for cellular distribution of TLR4. In this study we hypothesized that the cytoplasmic tail of TLR4 contains regions that control both localization and signaling. Using truncation and mutation analysis, and paying particular attention to the TIR domain, we identified a single amino acid that is pivotal for both TLR4 signaling and subcellular distribution. The site we found was on the C-terminal portion of the TIR domain for which no specific function has been yet determined. Reagents and Other Materials—Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli O55:B5 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and applied without repurification. FLAG- and hexa-histidine (His6)-tagged human TLR4 expression plasmid (pEFBOS/humanTLR4flaghis) and FLAG- and His6-tagged human MD-2 expression plasmid (pEFBOS/humanMD-2flaghis) were generous gifts from Dr. Kensuke Miyake (Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan). Human CD14 cDNA plasmid (pCMV6-XL5/humanCD14) was purchased from OriGene (Rockville, MD). Fluorescent protein expression vector pEGFP-N3 was purchased from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). Anti-TLR4 monoclonal antibody (clone HTA125) was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (clone M2) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-A.v. (GFP) monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Clontech. Control immunoglobulins for immunoprecipitation were purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-immunoglobulins antibodies were purchased from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark). BlockAce (DS Pharma Biomedical, Osaka, Japan) solution was used as blocking buffer for Western blotting. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin solution (Invitrogen). FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) was used for transient cotransfection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Culture dishes or plates were prepared to 70% confluence prior to transfection. Cells were used for experiments 36 h later. The transfection conditions were optimized for microscopic observation of the expressed fluorescent protein and were kept unchanged in other experiments. Expression Vector Subcloning and Mutagenesis—Wild-type TLR4 cDNA was excised from pEFBOS/humanTLR4flaghis and subcloned into pEGFP-N3 so that when expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) would be fused at the C terminus of TLR4 (pEGFP-N3/humanTLR4). All mutations were introduced into pEFBOS/humanTLR4flaghis and pEGFP-N3/humanTLR4 using the QuikChange site-Directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and were confirmed by sequencing. For the truncation analysis, two identical unique restriction sites were prepared in the TLR4-coding region of pEFBOS/humanTLR4 using a QuikChange kit, and the DNA fragment to be removed, which was a part of the C terminus of TLR4, was excised enzymatically. After agarose gel purification, the linear double-stranded DNA was ligated to re-form a circular plasmid. Restriction sites were designed so as not to cause a frame-shift between TLR4 and EGFP. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy of Cells—Samples were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde-phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 10 min. Fluorescence images of fixed samples were recorded using a FluoView FV1000 Confocal Microscope (an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Immunoprecipitation—Transfected cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, and proteinase inhibitor mixture), sonicated, and centrifuged at 4 °C. Antibody was added to the supernatant, and the sample was rotated 1 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) and an additional 8-h incubation at 4 °C. Bound protein was washed three times in lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Biotinylation and Purification of Cell Surface Proteins—Prior to surface biotinylation, HEK 293T cells plated in a 100-mm dish were transiently transfected as described above. Surface biotinylation and subsequent purification of biotinylated proteins were performed using a Cell Surface Protein Biotinylation and Purification Kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, membrane-impermeable sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin) was added to cell monolayers in the culture dishes and covalently bound to amines in proteins exposed on the cell surface. The affinity resin that binds to the biotin end of Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin was used to collect the biotinylated proteins. Reduction by 1,4-dithiothreitol causes cleavage of the disulfide bond in Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin, and the elute contains the biotinylated cell surface proteins. Each final sample obtained was considered to contain proteins from an equal amount of cells, because all culture plates were treated equally and grown to full confluence. All samples were sonicated and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The membrane to which protein was transferred was blocked in blocking buffer for 1 h. Then the membrane was incubated with a primary antibody, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-immunoglobulins antibody. The protein bands were then visualized by using a chemiluminescence reagent, Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore, Billerica, MA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Stimulation Assays—HEK293T cells were plated and transiently transfected for assays. Thirty-six hours after the transfection, LPS was added to fresh culture medium in each well of the culture plates at the stated concentration. The duration of LPS stimulation was 7 h. Dual Luciferase Reporter Assays for NF-κB Activation—HEK293T cells were plated in 12-well culture plates (4 × 104 cells/well), and experimental cDNA plasmids were transiently transfected 36 h later using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent with 0.5 μg of NF-κB reporter plasmid expressing firefly luciferase (pNF-κB-Luc, Stratagene) and 0.05 μg of constitutively active Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (pRL-TK, Promega, Madison, WI) in addition to 0.5 μg each of TLR4-EGFP plasmid and MD-2 plasmid. Stimulation experiments were performed 36 h later. Firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and the Genelight55 luminometer (Microtech, Chiba, Japan). Relative luciferase activity (RLA) was obtained as the ratio of firefly luciferase activity to Renilla luciferase activity. Results are expressed as the ratio of RLA with LPS stimulation to RLA without LPS stimulation ([RLA LPS+]/[RLA LPS–]). This ratio should ideally approach 1 when no response to LPS stimulation is observed. Statistical Analyses—All quantitative experiments were repeated three times, and each experiment was done in triplicate. The ratio of relative luciferase activity of LPS+ to LPS– was calculated as the index of the responsiveness to the stimuli as explained above. When positive response is observed, the ratio should significantly exceed one. The means of the ratio were represented in bar graphs. The 95% confidence interval of the mean of the ratio was calculated and indicated on each bar in the graph, and p values were calculated using Student's t distribution compared with the hypothetical mean, one. Truncation Analysis of TLR 4—To identify amino acid sequences in the cytoplasmic tail of TLR4 that are involved in both signal transduction and subcellular distribution, first we generated five truncation mutants of TLR4 with a fluorescent protein (EGFP) at the C terminus of TLR4. Although there are no known definite sorting signal motifs in the cytoplasmic tail of TLR4, some amino acid sequences are similar or identical to known general sorting signal motifs as shown in Fig. 1. YXXØ, a form of tyrosine-based sorting signal, and EXXXLL, a form of dileucine (LL)-based sorting signal, both control protein internalization, lysosomal targeting, and basolateral targeting (10Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 2003; 72: 395-447Google Scholar), where “X” represents any amino acid, “Ø” stands for an amino acid residue with a bulky hydrophobic side chain, and other letters are single-letter abbreviations for the amino acids. “Diacidic” signals such as DXE mediate export from the ER (11Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science.. 1997; 277: 556-558Google Scholar). RR or RXR is another example of an ER export signal (12Nufer O. Hauri H.P. Curr. Biol.. 2003; 13: R391-393Google Scholar). Truncation sites were chosen so that some of these amino acid sequences were deleted in each mutant. Because the TIR domain, which is essential in TLR4 signaling and possibly subcellular localization (13Slack J.L. Schooley K. Bonnert T.P. Mitcham J.L. Qwarnstrom E.E. Sims J.E. Dower S.K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 4670-4678Google Scholar), spans most of the cytoplasmic domain of TLR4, four out of five mutants have involvement in the TIR domain, which we hypothesized could result in impaired signal transduction and a change in subcellular distribution. Part of the cytoplasmic portion of the amino acid sequence of the truncation mutants is shown in Fig. 1. The five truncation mutant proteins lost their C-terminal tails at positions 826, 815, 802, 788, and 766, respectively, and were conjugated with EGFP in vitro. Actual truncation and ligation sites of all actual mutants were confirmed to have the designed DNA alignment by sequencing. We utilized the luciferase reporter assay to assess NF-κB transcription activity as an indicator of TLR4 response to LPS stimuli. MD-2 is reported to be essential for this response (9Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med.. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Google Scholar). However, because it is not known whether MD-2 is necessary for transduction of the truncated TLR4 signal as well, we performed the assays with and without MD-2. The index of cell responsiveness to the stimulation was measured as the ratio between RLA with LPS stimulation and RLA without LPS stimulation. Only cells transfected with TLR4 (826tr)-EGFP in combination with MD-2 retained responsiveness to LPS stimulation. One exception was wild-type TLR4-EGFP (Fig. 2A). HEK293T cells transfected with TLR4 but without MD-2 did not respond to LPS stimuli regardless of the TLR4-EGFP genotype (Fig. 2B). Next, we compared the localization of wild-type and truncated mutants of TLR4-EGFP in HEK293T by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3A). The wild-type TLR4 cotransfected with MD-2 was expressed on the plasma membrane and also in the perinuclear area. These findings were consistent with observations by others (14Latz E. Visintin A. Lien E. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Kurt-Jones E.A. Golenbock D.T. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 47834-47843Google Scholar, 15Nagai Y. Akashi S. Nagafuku M. Ogata M. Iwakura Y. Akira S. Kitamura T. Kosugi A. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Nat. Immunol.. 2002; 3: 667-672Google Scholar). TLR4 is reported to localize in the Golgi apparatus as well as on the plasma membrane. Our observation of TLR4-EGFP accumulation in the perinuclear area does not contradict the report that TLR4 partly localizes in the Golgi apparatus (14Latz E. Visintin A. Lien E. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Kurt-Jones E.A. Golenbock D.T. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 47834-47843Google Scholar). TLR4-EGFP truncation mutants, 815tr, 802tr, 788tr, and 766tr apparently did not localize at the plasma membrane. No particular fluorescence pattern that might be characteristic of localization to a specific intracellular compartment was observed. Only TLR4 (826tr)-EGFP, which has the shortest truncation, was expressed on the plasma membrane and in the perinuclear area, and the fluorescence pattern was similar to that of wild-type (Fig. 3A). No TLR4 genotypes, including wild-type TLR4-EGFP, clearly localized on the plasma membrane in the absence of MD-2 (Fig. 3A). MD-2 is reported to be necessary for localization of wild-type TLR4 at the plasma membrane (15Nagai Y. Akashi S. Nagafuku M. Ogata M. Iwakura Y. Akira S. Kitamura T. Kosugi A. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Nat. Immunol.. 2002; 3: 667-672Google Scholar), which is consistent with our observation. Intracellular distribution of mutant TLR4 varied depending on the genotype, but no particular cellular structure was identified as an alternative target site. Furthermore, we examined the plasma membrane expression of TLR4 (826tr)-EGFP by cell surface protein biotinylation. The expression level of TLR4 (826tr)-EGFP was markedly decreased without coexpression of MD-2 (Fig. 3B), which is compatible with the microscope observation. Removal of the C-terminal segment of TLR4 at residue 826 does not qualitatively affect LPS responsiveness and subcellular distribution. However, when more residues, up to position 815, were removed, both signal transduction and plasma membrane localization were impaired. These results suggest that residues 815–826 of TLR4 contain at least one segment that is critical for those functions. Amino Acid Sequence Replacement Analysis—To identify critical amino acid sequences in this region, we generated an amino acid replacement mutant of TLR4 instead of truncation mutants. As shown in Fig. 1, although it is not a canonical sequence, leucine-leucine at 815–816 partially fits a known sorting signal motif, a dileucine motif, (D/E)XXXL(L/I) or DXXLL, which plays an important role in internalization of plasma membrane protein or sorting from the trans-Golgi network (10Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 2003; 72: 395-447Google Scholar). Thus, as has been done in a similar study (16Hein C. Andre B. Mol. Microbiol.. 1997; 24: 607-616Google Scholar), a mutant was generated in which alanines were substituted for both leucines at positions 815 and 816. We measured the NF-κB activity of TLR4 (L815AL816A)-EGFP, the mutant in which both leucines were replaced with alanines, under LPS stimulation (Fig. 4A). This mutant protein did not respond to LPS stimuli. Microscopic observation revealed that TLR4 (L815AL816A)-EGFP was not expressed on the plasma membrane regardless of whether MD-2 was cotransfected (Fig. 4B). The phenotype of this doubly substituted mutant appeared to be the same as that of the truncation mutants. These results imply that the leucines in positions 815 and 816 play an important role in TLR4 plasma membrane localization. Analysis of Single Amino Acid Substitution Mutants—As previously mentioned, the amino acid sequence leucine-leucine at positions 815 and 816 does not completely match the dileucine motif, i.e. it lacks a preceding acidic amino acid. Therefore it was reasonable to explore whether leucines 815 and 816 need to be adjacent to each other. We created five genotypes of single amino acid mutants of TLR4: TLR4 (K813A)-EGFP, TLR4 (L815A)-EGFP, TLR4 (L816A)-EGFP, and TLR4 (D817A)-EGFP. We excluded the amino acid at position 814 from the analysis, because the amino acid in position 814 of wild-type TLR4 is alanine. The amino acid sequence alignment of wild-type TLR4 and the single amino acid replacement mutants is shown in Fig. 5. DNA sequences were confirmed by sequencing. As was done with truncation mutants, we measured NF-κB activity of wild-type TLR4-EGFP, TLR4 (K813A)-EGFP, TLR4 (L815A)-EGFP, TLR4 (L816A)-EGFP, and TLR4 (D817A)-EGFP in response to LPS stimulation. All mutants except TLR4 (L815A)-EGFP showed responsiveness to LPS stimulation with coexpression of MD-2 (Fig. 6A). Without MD-2, no genotype of TLR4-EGFP responded to LPS stimulation (Fig. 6B). LPS stimulation was performed in an identical manner as with truncation mutants. We analyzed the subcellular distribution of single amino acid mutants of TLR4-EGFP with and without MD-2 coexpression by fluorescence microscopy. TLR4 (K813A)-EGFP and TLR4 (D817A)-EGFP showed a similar fluorescence pattern to the wild-type, which localized at the plasma membrane when coexpressed with MD-2. No genotypes of TLR4-EGFP localized on the plasma membrane without MD-2 (Fig. 7). The cells transfected with TLR4 (L815A)-EGFP coexpressed with MD-2 did not show plasma membrane fluorescent pattern. Also, TLR4 (L815A)-EGFP showed comparatively weaker fluoresce than other mutants, possibly due to lower expression of the protein. Fluorescence of TLR4 (L816A)-EGFP with MD-2 was ambiguous as for the plasma membrane expression. Some kind of membranous structure was observed in the cytoplasmic area, but the intensity of the plasma membrane green fluorescence was obscure. Together with the results from the LPS stimulation experiment, the leucines at positions 815 and 816 are considered to play important roles in signal transduction and/or subcellular distribution of TLR4. Because EGFP consists of 239 amino acids, which is about one-third the size of the complete TLR4 protein, the experimental results obtained using TLR4-EGFP could have been influenced by the presence of the EGFP fused at the C terminus of TLR4. To rule out this possibility, we tested the functional integrity of both TLR4 (L815A) and TLR4 (L816A) with and without EGFP at the C terminus. Reporter assays were performed under the same conditions except that the shorter tag, FLAG-His6, which has only 21-amino acid tags at the C terminus, was fused to TLR4 in place of EGFP. There was no difference between EGFP-tagged proteins and FLAG-His6-tagged proteins in the relative pattern of responsiveness against LPS stimulation (Fig. 8A). Because CD14 is also important for LPS recognition by TLR4, we examined the effect of CD14 coexpression on the phenotypic changes of the mutants (17Beutler B. Curr. Opin. Immunol.. 2000; 12: 20-26Google Scholar, 18Akashi S. Ogata H. Kirikae F. Kirikae T. Kawasaki K. Nishijima M. Shimazu R. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2000; 268: 172-177Google Scholar). Coexpression of CD14 did not change the phenotypes of wild-type TLR4, TLR4 (L815A), and TLR4 (L816A) in terms of LSP responsiveness (data not shown). Cell surface expressions of the wild-type, L815A mutant, and L816A mutant TLR4-FLAG-His6 fusion proteins were also examined. Live cells transfected with wild-type TLR4, the L815A mutant or the L816A mutant as well as human MD-2 and CD14 were biotinylated on the cell surface, and the biotinylated proteins were affinity-purified and subjected to Western blotting. Fig. 8B shows the marked difference in cell surface expression of wild-type and mutants L815A and L816A. Note that biotinylated proteins have additional residues on every amine of the extracellular domain, which leads to a band shift during electrophoresis. Although both mutants were detected far less than the wild-type on the cell surface, comparatively more L816A mutant was expressed on the plasma membrane than L815A mutant, and the amount of L815A mutant seemed to be negligible compared with the wild type. These results may clarify the ambiguity of the microscopic observation of TLR4 (L815A) and TLR4 (L816A). Plasma membrane expression of TLR4 was impaired when the leucine at 815 or 816 was replaced to alanine. But the leucine at 815 is more critical, and the mutant L816A may show the weaker phenotypic change. To further investigate the characteristics of the TLR4 (L815A) mutant, we performed an immunoprecipitation assay of wild-type and mutant TLR4. Cells were transfected with a human MD-2-FLAG-His6 expression vector and either the wild-type or the mutant (L815A) TLR4-EGFP expression vector. Anti-TLR4 monoclonal antibody (clone HTA125), anti-GFP polyclonal antibody, or anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody was added to the lysate and precipitated with Protein G-Sepharose beads. Collected proteins were eluted and subjected to Western blotting. The results are shown in Fig. 8C. TLR4 (L815A) was not immunoprecipitated with anti-TLR4 antibody (HTA125). HTA125 antibody was raised against TLR4-expressing cells (9Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med.. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Google Scholar) and recognizes the extracellular portion of TLR4. This result suggests that the amino acid replacement at position 815 may cause a change in the extracellular portion of TLR4 and/or that the replacement may also inhibit cell surface expression of the mutant protein. On the other hand, both wild-type TLR4-EGFP and mutant TLR4-EGFP were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP polyclonal antibody, which recognized EGFP. However, of the two bands of TLR4, the heavier band seems to be somewhat faint in the mutant, whereas in the wild type the heavier band is at least as dense as the lighter one. TLR4 can be detected as two separate bands in a Western blot (19Ohnishi T. Muroi M. Tanamoto K. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol.. 2003; 10: 405-410Google Scholar), especially under transient transfection conditions. The difference in proportion of the heavy and light bands between wild-type and mutant TLR4 may suggest that there is some difference in glycosylation. Furthermore, wild-type TLR4 was coprecipitated with MD-2-FLAG-His6, but the mutant TLR4 could not be detected (Fig. 8C, lanes 4 and 8). Because MD-2 is associated with TLR4 (9Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med.. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Google Scholar), it is logical to expect that immunoprecipitating MD-2-FLAG-His6 with anti-FLAG antibody should cause TLR4 to be coprecipitated with it. It is suggested by the result here that the association of the TLR4 mutant with MD-2 is impaired. In this research, we performed mutagenesis analyses of particular amino acid residues in TLR4 to explore the mechanisms of TLR4 intracellular signal transduction and subcellular distribution. We found the candidate residues by analyzing truncation mutants of TLR4 in the cytoplasmic region, in which both signaling and normal subcellular distribution of TLR4 are disturbed. Because we are focusing on a common mechanism for the impaired signaling and distribution, we finally picked a single amino acid mutant that does not respond to LPS stimuli, as measured with NF-κB reporter luciferase assay, and one that does not localize on the plasma membrane. TLR4 (L815A) is a mutant that meets these conditions, and our results suggest that the leucine at position 815 of TLR4 is required for both signal transduction and plasma membrane localization. The best known single amino acid mutant of TLR4 is TLR4 (P712H) known as the Lpsd mutation in the C3H/HeJ mouse, which corresponds to position 714 in this study of human TLR4 (5Qureshi S.T. Lariviere L. Leveque G. Clermont S. Moore K.J. Gros P. Malo D. J. Exp. Med.. 1999; 189: 615-625Google Scholar, 6Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science.. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Google Scholar, 20Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature.. 2000; 408: 111-115Google Scholar). Mice carrying this mutation opened up the rediscovery of TLR4 as a key player in innate immunity. Because this proline residue at this position is within the TIR domain and is conserved among TLRs or TLR4s of other species, it is assumed that the residue plays an important role in TLR4 function. The association of TLR4 (P712H) with its adapter proteins is reported to be intact, and the explanation for the functional impairment of TLR4 (P712H) is not clear (21Dunne A. Ejdeback M. Ludidi P.L. O'Neill L.A. Gay N.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 41443-41451Google Scholar, 22Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G. Jefferies C.A. Mansell A.S. Brady G. Brint E. Dunne A. Gray P. Harte M.T. McMurray D. Smith D.E. Sims J.E. Bird T.A. O'Neill L.A. Nature.. 2001; 413: 78-83Google Scholar, 23Horng T. Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol.. 2001; 2: 835-841Google Scholar). Some single amino acid variants are found in humans, and these are related to the incidence or prognosis of some infections and other diseases. A growing body of data suggests that the ability of certain individuals to respond properly to TLR4 ligands may be impaired by single-nucleotide polymorphisms within TLR4 genes (24Schroder N.W. Schumann R.R. Lancet Infect. Dis.. 2005; 5: 156-164Google Scholar). The D299G and T399I alleles of the TLR4 gene have been associated with increased risk of severe infections (25Agnese D.M. Calvano J.E. Hahm S.J. Coyle S.M. Corbett S.A. Calvano S.E. Lowry S.F. J. Infect. Dis.. 2002; 186: 1522-1525Google Scholar). By clarifying the subcellular component where the mutant protein is retained, or by clarifying to which compartment the mutant is not delivered, the abnormal intracellular sorting that is caused by the mutation in TLR4 (L815A) could be elucidated more precisely. Usually a sorting signal motif is comprised of several amino acids. In this regard, if the leucine at position 815 is a part of a motif, there should be other amino acids that are also members of the motif. Although replacement of leucine with alanine at position 816 did not cause an apparent signal transduction impediment, plasma membrane expression of TLR4 (L816A) was impaired to a certain extent. Positive response to LPS stimulation by TLR4(L816A) could be attributable to this small amount of expression on the plasma membrane. Mutagenesis analyses of neighboring amino acids of the leucine at 815 were not definitive, but the results could be suggestive that the adjacent leucine at 816 may work together with the leucine at 815. Leucines at position 815 and 816 could be in the same motif, and the leucine at position 816 may be less critical. Several proteins have been reported to be involved in TLR4 cell surface expression. Heat shock protein gp96 is necessary for TLR4 association with MD-2 in the ER and for subsequent cell surface expression (26Randow F. Seed B. Nat. Cell Biol.. 2001; 3: 891-896Google Scholar). PRAT4A and PRAT4B are associated with TLR4 and regulate TLR4 cell surface expression (27Wakabayashi Y. Kobayashi M. Akashi-Takamura S. Tanimura N. Konno K. Takahashi K. Ishii T. Mizutani T. Iba H. Kouro T. Takaki S. Takatsu K. Oda Y. Ishihama Y. Saitoh S. Miyake K. J. Immunol.. 2006; 177: 1772-1779Google Scholar, 28Konno K. Wakabayashi Y. Akashi-Takamura S. Ishii T. Kobayashi M. Takahashi K. Kusumoto Y. Saitoh S. Yoshizawa Y. Miyake K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2006; 339: 1076-1082Google Scholar). In embryonic fibroblasts of MD-2 knockout mice, TLR4 localization on the cell surface is severely impaired, and most TLR4 is retained in the ER or Golgi apparatus (15Nagai Y. Akashi S. Nagafuku M. Ogata M. Iwakura Y. Akira S. Kitamura T. Kosugi A. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Nat. Immunol.. 2002; 3: 667-672Google Scholar). MD-2 binds to TLR4 at its extracellular domain and is essential for LPS recognition by TLR4 (29Nishitani C. Mitsuzawa H. Sano H. Shimizu T. Matsushima N. Kuroki Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 38322-38329Google Scholar). Although proteins such as CD14 and LPS-binding protein are reported to have important roles in LPS recognition by TLR4, in an in vitro setting HEK293T cells gain LPS responsiveness by introducing only TLR4 and MD-2 genes when measured by NF-κB reporter assay (9Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med.. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Google Scholar, 30Akashi S. Shimazu R. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Takeda K. Kimoto M. Miyake K. J. Immunol.. 2000; 164: 3471-3475Google Scholar). Without transfection, HEK293 cells do not express TLR4, MD-2, or CD14, which are involved in LPS-induced intracellular signaling (31Espevik T. Latz E. Lien E. Monks B. Golenbock D.T. Scand. J. Infect. Dis.. 2003; 35: 660-664Google Scholar, 32Muta T. Takeshige K. Eur. J. Biochem.. 2001; 268: 4580-4589Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the association of the TLR4 mutant and MD-2 is impaired (Fig. 8C). Post-translational modification is another important factor for TLR4 function. Asparagine residues in the extracellular portion of TLR4 need to be glycosylated for plasma membrane expression of TLR4 (15Nagai Y. Akashi S. Nagafuku M. Ogata M. Iwakura Y. Akira S. Kitamura T. Kosugi A. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Nat. Immunol.. 2002; 3: 667-672Google Scholar, 19Ohnishi T. Muroi M. Tanamoto K. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol.. 2003; 10: 405-410Google Scholar, 33da Silva Correia J. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 1845-1854Google Scholar). TLR4·MD-2 association is necessary for this glycosylation as well. The difference in the proportion of the heavy band to lighter band between wild-type and L815A mutant TLR4 immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP polyclonal antibody suggests that there may be some difference in glycosylation between wild-type and L815A mutant TLR4 (Fig. 8C). Although leucine at position 815 is located in the cytoplasmic tail of TLR4, we speculated that substitution of leucine at position 815 may cause a conformational change in the extracellular portion of the protein, which may interfere with the association between L815A mutant TLR4 and MD-2, leading to inhibition of glycosylation and cell surface expression of the mutant protein. Further investigation may reveal the mechanism involved in this phenotypic change in TLR4 (L815A), which would lead to better understanding of the mechanism of wild-type TLR4 signaling and trafficking. We greatly appreciate the gift of human TLR4 and MD-2 cDNA from Dr. Kensuke Miyake (Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan)."
https://openalex.org/W2107023193,"Objective Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) often hinders the cardiac rehabilitation program. The aim of this study was evaluating the relative cost-effectiveness of new rehabilitation strategies which include the diagnosis and treatment of PAD in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing cardiac rehabilitation. Data Sources Best-available evidence was retrieved from literature and combined with primary data from 231 patients. Methods We developed a Markov decision model to compare the following treatment strategies: 1. cardiac rehabilitation only; 2. ankle-brachial index (ABI) if cardiac rehabilitation fails followed by diagnostic work-up and revascularization for PAD if needed; 3. ABI prior to cardiac rehabilitation followed by diagnostic work-up and revascularization for PAD if needed. Quality-adjusted-life years (QALYs), life-time costs (US $), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER), and gain in net health benefits (NHB) in QALY equivalents were calculated. A threshold willingness-to-pay of $75 000 was used. Results ABI if cardiac rehabilitation fails was the most favorable strategy with an ICER of $44 251 per QALY gained and an incremental NHB compared to cardiac rehabilitation only of 0.03 QALYs (95% CI: −0.17, 0.29) at a threshold willingness-to-pay of $75 000/QALY. After sensitivity analysis, a combined cardiac and vascular rehabilitation program increased the success rate and would dominate the other two strategies with total lifetime costs of $30 246 a quality-adjusted life expectancy of 3.84 years, and an incremental NHB of 0.06 QALYs (95%CI:−0.24, 0.46) compared to current practice. The results were robust for other different input parameters. Conclusion ABI measurement if cardiac rehabilitation fails followed by a diagnostic work-up and revascularization for PAD if needed are potentially cost-effective compared to cardiac rehabilitation only."
