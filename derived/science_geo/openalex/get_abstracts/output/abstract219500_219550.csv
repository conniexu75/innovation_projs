https://openalex.org/W2072687635,"A DNA nanostructure consisting of four four-arm junctions oriented with a square aspect ratio was designed and constructed. Programmable self-assembly of 4 x 4 tiles resulted in two distinct lattice morphologies: uniform-width nanoribbons and two-dimensional nanogrids, which both display periodic square cavities. Periodic protein arrays were achieved by templated self-assembly of streptavidin onto the DNA nanogrids containing biotinylated oligonucleotides. On the basis of a two-step metallization procedure, the 4 x 4 nanoribbons acted as an excellent scaffold for the production of highly conductive, uniform-width, silver nanowires."
https://openalex.org/W2131957545,"The RNA interference (RNAi) pathway is initiated by processing long double-stranded RNA into small interfering RNA (siRNA). The siRNA-generating enzyme was purified from Drosophila S2cells and consists of two stoichiometric subunits: Dicer-2(DCR-2) and a previously unknown protein that we named R2D2. R2D2 is homologous to the Caenorhabditis elegans RNAi protein RDE-4. Association with R2D2 does not affect the enzymatic activity of DCR-2. Rather, the DCR-2/R2D2 complex, but not DCR-2 alone, binds to siRNA and enhances sequence-specific messenger RNA degradation mediated by the RNA-initiated silencing complex (RISC). These results indicate that R2D2 bridges the initiation and effector steps of the Drosophila RNAi pathway by facilitating siRNA passage from Dicer to RISC."

https://openalex.org/W2067853799,"The classical paradigm for dendritic cell function derives from the study of Langerhans cells, which predominate within skin epidermis. After an encounter with foreign agents, Langerhans cells are thought to migrate to draining lymph nodes, where they initiate T cell priming. Contrary to this, we show here that infection of murine epidermis by herpes simplex virus did not result in the priming of virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes by Langerhans cells. Rather, the priming response required a distinct CD8alpha+ dendritic cell subset. Thus, the traditional view of Langerhans cells in epidermal immunity needs to be revisited to accommodate a requirement for other dendritic cells in this response."
https://openalex.org/W2107919289,"The immunological synapse is a specialized cell-cell junction between T cell and antigen-presenting cell surfaces. It is characterized by a central cluster of antigen receptors, a ring of integrin family adhesion molecules, and temporal stability over hours. The role of this specific organization in signaling for T cell activation has been controversial. We use in vitro and in silico experiments to determine that the immunological synapse acts as a type of adaptive controller that both boosts T cell receptor triggering and attenuates strong signals."

https://openalex.org/W2159286929,"Unexpectedly high concentrations of ultrafine particles were observed over a wide range of latitudes in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Particle number concentrations and size distributions simulated by a numerical model of ion-induced nucleation, constrained by measured thermodynamic data and observed atmospheric key species, were consistent with the observations. These findings indicate that, at typical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere conditions, particles are formed by this nucleation process and grow to measurable sizes with sufficient sun exposure and low preexisting aerosol surface area. Ion-induced nucleation is thus a globally important source of aerosol particles, potentially affecting cloud formation and radiative transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2113554481,"High-resolution analyses of lake sediment from southwestern Alaska reveal cyclic variations in climate and ecosystems during the Holocene. These variations occurred with periodicities similar to those of solar activity and appear to be coherent with time series of the cosmogenic nuclides 14C and 10Be as well as North Atlantic drift ice. Our results imply that small variations in solar irradiance induced pronounced cyclic changes in northern high-latitude environments. They also provide evidence that centennial-scale shifts in the Holocene climate were similar between the subpolar regions of the North Atlantic and North Pacific, possibly because of Sun-ocean-climate linkages."
https://openalex.org/W2098439624,We connected dislocation-based atomic-scale and continuum models of plasticity in crystalline solids through numerical simulations of dislocation intersections in face-centered cubic crystals. The results contradict the traditional assumption that strain hardening is governed by the formation of sessile junctions between dislocations. The interaction between two dislocations with collinear Burgers vectors gliding in intersecting slip planes was found to be by far the strongest of all reactions. Its properties were investigated and discussed using a multiscale approach.
https://openalex.org/W2008472371,"Many eukaryotic signaling proteins are composed of simple modular binding domains, yet they can display sophisticated behaviors such as allosteric gating and multi-input signal integration, properties essential for complex cellular circuits. To understand how such behavior can emerge from combinations of simple domains, we engineered variants of the actin regulatory protein N-WASP (neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) in which the ""output"" domain of N-WASP was recombined with heterologous autoinhibitory ""input"" domains. Synthetic switch proteins were created with diverse gating behaviors in response to nonphysiological inputs. Thus, this type of modular framework can facilitate the evolution or engineering of cellular signaling circuits."

https://openalex.org/W2100078626,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a key regulator of inflammatory responses and has been implicated in many pathological conditions. We used structure-based design to engineer variant TNF proteins that rapidly form heterotrimers with native TNF to give complexes that neither bind to nor stimulate signaling through TNF receptors. Thus, TNF is inactivated by sequestration. Dominant-negative TNFs represent a possible approach to anti-inflammatory biotherapeutics, and experiments in animal models show that the strategy can attenuate TNF-mediated pathology. Similar rational design could be used to engineer inhibitors of additional TNF superfamily cytokines as well as other multimeric ligands."

However, the molecular identity of the pH sensor and its interaction with downstream effector proteins remain poorly understood. Using the male reproductive tract as a model system in which luminal acidification is critical for sperm maturation and storage, we now report a novel pathway for pH regulation linking the bicarbonate activated soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) to the vacuolar H+ATPase (V-ATPase). Clear cells of the epididymis and vas deferens contain abundant V-ATPase in their apical pole and are responsible for acidifying the lumen. Proton secretion is regulated via active recycling of V-ATPase. Here we demonstrate that this recycling is regulated by luminal pH and bicarbonate. sAC is highly expressed in clear cells, and apical membrane accumulation of V-ATPase is triggered by a sAC-dependent rise in cAMP in response to alkaline luminal pH. As sAC is expressed in other acid/base transporting epithelia, including kidney and choroid plexus, this cAMP-dependent signal transduction pathway may be a widespread mechanism that allows cells to sense and modulate extracellular pH.

It does not have predicted transmembrane domains and is present in both soluble and particulate fractions of cellular extracts (4.Wuttke M.S. Buck J. Levin L.R.

Wang X.Y. Mattia M. Conti M. Buck J. Wolgemuth D.J. Levin L.R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2000; 56: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) where it is proposed to mediate the bicarbonate-dependent cAMP elevation that precedes capacitation, hyperactivated motility, and acrosome reaction needed for fertilization (1.Chen Y. Cann M.J. Litvin T.N. Iourgenko V. Sinclair M.L. Levin L.R. Buck J. Science. 2000; 289: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). While spermatozoa mature and are stored along the epididymal lumen, they are kept in a quiescent state by an acidic pH of 6.5–6.8 and a low bicarbonate concentration of 2–7 mm (8.Levine N. Marsh D.J. J. Physiol. (Lond). 1971; 213: 557-570Crossref Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We have previously shown (9.Breton S. Smith P.J. Lui B. Brown D. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 470-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 10.Brown D. Lui B. Gluck S. Sabolic I. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1992; 263: C913-C916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that a sub-population of epithelial cells, the so-called clear cells, are important players in the acidification capacity of the epididymis. Clear cells express high levels of the V-ATPase in their apical pole, and are responsible for the bulk of proton secretion in the vas deferens. Proton secretion by clear cells occurs in a chloride-independent but bicarbonate-dependent manner (11.Breton S. Hammar K. Smith P.J.S. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1998; 275: C1134-C1142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly to kidney intercalated cells, epididymal clear cells regulate their rate of proton secretion via V-ATPase recycling between intracellular vesicles and the apical plasma membrane (12.Breton S. Nsumu N.N. Galli T. Sabolic I. Smith P.J. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 278: F717-F725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells, as well as proton-secreting cells in the turtle bladder, an increase in V-ATPase surface expression and in apical surface area (including microvilli) closely correlates with an increase in proton secretion (13.Madsen K.M. Verlander J.W. Kim J. Tisher C.C. Kidney Int. 1991; 33: S57-S63Google Scholar, 14.Steinmetz P.R. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1986; 251: F173-F187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Brown D. Breton S. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 2345-2358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proton-secreting epithelial cells actively regulate their rate of proton secretion in response to variations in the pH of their immediate environment (15.Brown D. Breton S. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 2345-2358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular entities underlying this response still remain unknown. In the present study, we tested whether bicarbonate-regulated sAC might play a role in the dynamic V-ATPase recycling that occurs in these cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESLaser Capture Microdissection and RT-PCR—Epithelial cells from rat cauda epididymidis were harvested by laser capture microdissection, and mRNA was extracted and amplified in vitro following a T7-based amplification procedure, as we recently described (16.Isnard-Bagnis C.

The epididymis was removed and the cauda region was dissected and homogenized. Electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (16.Isnard-Bagnis C. Da Silva N. Beaulieu V. Yu A.S. Brown D. Breton S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: C220-C232Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), using a monoclonal antibody (R21) raised against the catalytic regions (C1 and C2) of sAC (6.Zippin J.H. Chen Y.

Protein was added at 20 μg/lane, and the antibody was used at a concentration of 1:250.Tissue Fixation and Immunofluorescence—Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (65 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally) and perfused via the left ventricle with PBS (pH 7.4) followed by a fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 10 mm sodium periodate, 70 mm lysine, and 5% sucrose (PLP) as described previously (11.Breton S.

Renal Physiol. 2000; 278: F717-F725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kidney and male reproductive tract organs were harvested and further fixed by immersion in the same fixative overnight. Immunofluorescence was performed on 4 μm cryostat sections. An affinity-purified chicken polyclonal antibody against the E subunit of the V-ATPase was used. This antibody has been characterized previously (17.Breton S. Wiederhold T. Marshansky V. Nsumu N.N. Ramesh V. Brown D. J. Biol.

Cann M.J. Litvin T.N. Iourgenko V. Sinclair M.L. Levin L.R. Buck J. Science. 2000; 289: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar) and monoclonal antibody R21 (6.Zippin J.H. Chen Y.

FASEB J. 2003; 17: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), both against the catalytic regions (C1 and C2) of sAC.In Vivo Perfusion of the Distal Cauda Epididymidis—Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital as described above. The vas deferens was cannulated through the lumen with a micro cannula (0.4 mm OD, 0.2 mm ID; Kent Scientific Coorporation, Torrington, CT) connected to a 10-ml syringe. A small incision was made in the distal cauda epididymal region to allow the perfusate to exit the tubule. Perfusion was performed retrogradely at a rate of 45 μl/min using a syringe pump (Model 341B, Fisher). The lumen was initially washed free of sperm with PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, 2 mm potassium phosphate, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl) adjusted to different pH values (6.5, 6.8, 7.1, or 7.8), as indicated under “Results.” Horseradish peroxidase (HRP, Sigma) was added to the perfusate at a concentration of 5 mg/ml to detect endocytosis in the absence or presence of inhibitors and/or cpt-cAMP as indicated under “Results.” At the end of the experimental period, the luminal solution was changed for HRP-free ice-cold PBS for 3 min (in the continued presence of agonists or inhibitors, if applicable) to wash the lumen free of HRP. The vas deferens and cauda epididymidis were harvested and fixed by immersion in a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 10 mm sodium periodate, 75 mm lysine, and 5% sucrose (PLP) for 5 h at room temperature, or overnight at 4 °C (11.Breton S. Hammar K. Smith P.J.S. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1998; 275: C1134-C1142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Breton S. Nsumu N.N. Galli T. Sabolic I. Smith P.J. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 278: F717-F725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tissues were then washed in PBS, pH 7.4, and stored in PBS containing 0.02% sodium azide. At least three vas deferens and cauda epididymidis were perfused for each condition described. A minimum of 10 cells per tissue were examined by confocal microscopy for a total of at least 30 cells per condition.Immunogold Electron Microscopy—Small pieces of PLP-fixed epididymis were post-fixed by immersion in phosphate buffer containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.05% glutaraldehyde for 4 h at room temperature. For V-ATPase immunogold staining, pieces of tissues were embedded at low temperature with HM20 resin as described previously (10.Brown D. Lui B. Gluck S. Sabolic I. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1992; 263: C913-C916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Double labeling for V-ATPase and HRP was performed on LR White Resin embedded sections.Quantification of Gold Particle Labeling—The relative amount of V-ATPase present in the apical microvilli of clear cells was determined from the number of V-ATPase-associated gold particles per unit length of apical membrane. Gold particles present in the apical membrane including microvilli were counted for each cell, and the number was divided by the total length of apical membrane and microvilli for that cell. Using a Wacom graphics tablet and NIH Image software, at least ten cells were analyzed in each group. Data are presented as mean ± S.E.Cyclase Assay—Cyclase assays were performed in 100 μl reaction volume with 100 ng of His6-tagged rat sACt purified over a nickelnitrilotriacetic acid affinity column as described (1.Chen Y. Cann M.J. Litvin T.N. Iourgenko V. Sinclair M.L. Levin L.R. Buck J. Science. 2000; 289: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar) in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 20 mm creatinephosphate, 100 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 1 mm cAMP, 2.5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm NaHCO3 for 30 min at 30 °C. Estrogen compounds were purchased from Steraloids, Inc. (Newport, RI).RESULTSsAC Expression and Localization in the Epididymis and Kidney—Epididymal epithelial cells were harvested by laser capture microdissection, and mRNA was amplified in vitro. RT-PCR detected sAC mRNA, and the presence of other clear cell markers confirmed the validity of this preparation (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis using a specific monoclonal antibody, R21, against the N-terminal portion of sAC (6.Zippin J.H. Chen Y. Nahirney P. Kamenetsky M. Wuttke M.S. Fischman D.A. Levin L.R. Buck J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) detected a major band at around 48 kDa, the predicted molecular mass of the sACt splice variant (2.Buck J. Sinclair M.L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 31698-31708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), in the cauda epididymidis (Fig. 1B). sAC was localized by immunofluorescence using two different anti-sAC antibodies. Monoclonal antibody R21 gave a strong staining in clear cells, which were identified by their positive staining for the V-ATPase (Fig. 1C). No specific immunoreactivity was detected in adjacent principal cells, but surrounding muscle tissue and, as previously described (1.Chen Y. Cann M.J. Litvin T.N. Iourgenko V. Sinclair M.L. Levin L.R. Buck J. Science. 2000; 289: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 7.Sinclair M.L. Wang X.Y. Mattia M. Conti M. Buck J. Wolgemuth D.J. Levin L.R. Mol. Reprod.

The same pattern of staining was obtained using an affinity-purified anti-sAC rabbit polyclonal antiserum, but no staining was detected using control pre-immune serum (data not shown). sAC is also expressed in the kidney, where it is located in epithelial cells of distal tubules (Fig. 2A), thick ascending limb of Henle (Fig. 2, A and B) and collecting ducts (Fig. 2, B and C), consistent with previous results showing bicarbonate-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in rat kidney (20.Mittag T.W. Guo W.B. Kobayashi K. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F1060-F1064PubMed Google Scholar). Proton secretion is a common function of epididymal clear cells and of renal distal tubules, thick ascending limb of Henle, and collecting duct intercalated cells. Thus, sAC is highly expressed in specialized proton-secreting cells of epididymal and renal epithelia, where it might play a role in regulating acid/base transport in these tissues. To test for a potential role of sAC in modulating proton secretion, we used the epididymis as a model system.Fig. 2sAC localization in the kidney. Immunolocalization of sAC in kidney cortex (A), inner stripe of the outer medulla (B) and inner medulla (C). Cortical (cTAL) and medullary (mTAL) thick ascending limb of Henle, and distal tubules (DT) show significant expression of sAC. Collecting ducts (CD), which were identified by positive double labeling using V-ATPase antibodies (not shown), also show significant sAC immunolabeling.

Double immunofluorescence labeling for HRP and VATPase was performed on PLP-fixed cryostat sections. At the physiological luminal pH of 6.8, clear cells, identified by their positive immunoreactivity for V-ATPase, show a high endocytic activity compared with adjacent principal cells (Fig. 3, A and B, arrows). Electron microscopy double immunogold labeling for HRP and V-ATPase showed that a sub-population of HRP-containing endosomes clearly contain V-ATPase, indicating that the proton pump is actively recycled at physiological luminal pH (Fig. 3C). The effect of luminal pH variations on V-ATPase recycling was examined using confocal microscopy. At the acidic pH of 6.5, V-ATPase is distributed between the apical microvilli and intracellular sub-apical vesicles (Fig. 4, A, A', and A”). Double labeling for HRP indicated that the VATPase-containing vesicles partially co-localize with HRP-containing endosomes (yellow staining), indicating that a significant amount of V-ATPase is located in the endocytic compartment. In contrast, at the alkaline luminal pH of 7.8, V-ATPase is mainly located in apical microvilli (Fig. 4, B, B', and B”, green) and not in sub-apical HRP-containing endosomes (red staining). Almost no co-localization of V-ATPase and HRP is observed, indicating a very low rate of V-ATPase internalization. In addition, clear cells exposed to luminal pH 7.8 exhibit more developed V-ATPase-positive microvilli compared with cells exposed to pH 6.5. The lack of co-localization of V-ATPase with HRP-labeled endosomes and the increased length of V-ATPase positive microvilli indicate that translocation of V-ATPase from sub-apical vesicles to the apical membrane occurs at alkaline luminal pH. These results were confirmed by immunogold electron microscopy showing intracellular vesicle localization of V-ATPase at luminal pH 6.5 (Fig. 4C), and its predominant localization in extensive apical microvilli at pH 7.8 (Fig. 4D). Quantification of the number of V-ATPase-associated gold particles showed a significant increase in the apical membrane density of V-ATPase molecules at alkaline pH compared with acidic pH (Fig. 4E; p < 0.05). Thus, apical V-ATPase amplification occurs via both microvilli extension and an increase in V-ATPase density in the membrane. These results show that clear cells respond to variations in luminal pH by inducing a rapid (within 15 min), pH-dependent shuttling of V-ATPase between the intracellular HRP-positive endocytic compartment and apical microvilli. This alkaline-induced apical membrane V-ATPase accumulation is a potential mechanism to restore luminal pH to its physiological acidic value.Fig. 3V-ATPase recycling at physiological luminal pH.A and B, cauda epididymis tubule perfused with PBS containing HRP at the physiological luminal pH of 6.8. Anti-HRP staining revealed high endocytic activity of clear cells (A, arrows) compared with adjacent principal cells. Clear cells were identified by their positive immunofluorescence staining for V-ATPase (B, arrows). The box indicates the apical region of clear cells, which is examined in more detail in panel C.

To determine whether the pH-related translocation of V-ATPase was modulated by cAMP, cauda epididymidis were perfused at luminal pH of 6.5 with PBS containing the cAMP permeant analogue, 8-(4-chorophenylthio)-cAMP, (cpt-cAMP, 1 mm; Sigma) for 15 min. Under these conditions, V-ATPase was present in the apical microvilli and no co-localization of VATPase and HRP was observed, indicating that cAMP induced a translocation of V-ATPase from intracellular vesicles to the apical membrane, even at acidic luminal pH (Fig. 5A).Fig. 5Role of cAMP, intracellular HCO3- and sAC in V-ATPase recycling. Confocal images showing the apical regions of clear cells exposed to different luminal conditions and double-stained for V-ATPase (green) and HRP (red). A, PBS, pH 6.5, containing cpt-cAMP. V-ATPase is mainly located in apical microvilli and no co-localization with HRP is observed, despite the acidic luminal pH. B, PBS pH 7.8 containing acetazolamide. V-ATPase staining appears in the sub-apical and cytoplasmic regions of the cell. Very few V-ATPase-positive apical microvilli are visualized, despite the alkaline luminal pH of 7.8. C, perfusion with PBS, pH 7.8, containing acetazolamide followed by cpt-cAMP. V-ATPase-positive microvilli are clearly present, indicating that cAMP induced the apical translocation of V-ATPase. D, perfusion with PBS, pH 7.8, containing the sAC inhibitor, 2-hydroxyestradiol. V-ATPase is distributed between apical microvilli and sub-apical vesicles. A large amount of V-ATPase co-localizes with HRP-containing endosomes (yellow), indicating that inhibition of sAC prevents the usual alkaline pH-induced translocation of V-ATPase into apical microvilli. E, perfusion with PBS, pH 7.8, containing 2-hydroxyestradiol followed by cpt-cAMP (in the presence of 2-hydroxyestradiol). V-ATPase is present in apical microvilli and minimal co-localization with HRP is observed, indicating that cpt-cAMP induced a translocation of V-ATPase into apical microvilli, despite sAC inhibition. F, perfusion with PBS, pH 7.8, containing estradiol, which does not inhibit sAC. Predominant apical microvilli localization of V-ATPase is seen indicating that estradiol failed to inhibit the apical translocation of V-ATPase caused by alkaline pH.

CO2/HCO3- is the main buffer in biological systems, and the equilibrium between HCO3- and H+ with CO2 and H2O is catalyzed by carbonic anhydrases. Clear cells express very high levels of the cytosolic carbonic anhydrase type II (11.Breton S. Hammar K. Smith P.J.S. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1998; 275: C1134-C1142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Breton S. Tyszkowski R. Sabolic I. Brown D. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 111: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and we have shown that the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide, markedly decreases the rate of proton secretion in isolated vas deferens (11.Breton S. Hammar K. Smith P.J.S. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1998; 275: C1134-C1142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We, therefore, hypothesized that intracellular bicarbonate production via carbonic anhydrase type II in response to an alkaline luminal pH (and subsequent increase in intracellular pH) could activate sAC. Elevation of cAMP in response to sAC stimulation would then induce an accumulation of V-ATPase in the apical membrane. Cauda epididymidis were perfused in vivo with PBS at pH 7.8, in the presence of acetazolamide (100 μm; Sigma) for 15 min, to inhibit intracellular bicarbonate production via carbonic anhydrase type II. Under these conditions, clear cells showed an almost complete absence of apical microvilli, and V-ATPase was present in the cytoplasmic and sub-apical regions (Fig. 5B). It, therefore, appears that bicarbonate production via carbonic anhydrase is an essential step in the translocation of the V-ATPase from intracellular vesicles into the apical membrane at alkaline luminal pH. Addition of cpt-cAMP (1 mm) to the luminal perfusate for 10 min at the end of the acetazolamide treatment, but in the continued p"

https://openalex.org/W2089897141,"There is a strong correlation between age and cancer, but the mechanism by which this phenomenon occurs is unclear. We chose Saccharomyces cerevisiae to examine one of the hallmarks of cancer--genomic instability--as a function of cellular age. As diploid yeast mother cells aged, an approximately 100-fold increase in loss of heterozygosity (LOH) occurred. Extending life-span altered neither the onset nor the frequency of age-induced LOH; the switch to hyper-LOH appears to be on its own clock. In young cells, LOH occurs by reciprocal recombination, whereas LOH in old cells was nonreciprocal, occurring predominantly in the old mother's progeny. Thus, nuclear genomes may be inherently unstable with age."

Little is known about the mechanisms of action and uptake of MIL in either parasites or tumor cell lines.

LdMT is a novel P-type ATPase belonging to the partially characterized aminophospholipid translocase subfamily. Resistant parasites transfected with LdMT regain their sensitivity to MIL and edelfosine and the ability to normally take up [14C]MIL and fluorescent-labeled glycerophospholipids. Moreover, LdMT localizes to the plasma membrane, and its overexpression in Leishmania tarentolae, a species non-sensitive to MIL, significantly increases the uptake of [14C]MIL, strongly suggesting that this protein behaves as a true translocase. Finally, both LdMT-resistant alleles encompass single but distinct point mutations, each of which impairs transport function, explaining the resistant phenotype.

Leishmania donovani is a protozoan parasite that causes visceral leishmaniasis, an endemic disease of tropical and subtropical regions that is fatal if untreated (1.Herwaldt B.L.

TDR News. 2002; 68: 2Google Scholar). It is expected that MIL will play a key role in the control and possible eradication of visceral leishmaniasis (2.More B. Bhatt H. Kukreja V. Ainapure S.S.

Thus, it is of particular importance to understand the mechanisms underlying the development of MIL resistance in Leishmania before its wide clinical use.MIL was first developed as an antitumoral drug, together with the alkyl-glycerophospholipid edelfosine and other related drugs. A direct correlation between drug uptake and cellular sensitivity has been found in different eukaryotic cells (7.Zoeller R.A. Layne M.D. Modest E.J. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1866-1875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Mollinedo F. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Gajate C. Martin-Martin B. Benito A. Martinez-Dalmau R. Modolell M.

Gamarro F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 2397-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), but the mode of uptake of MIL and alkyl-glycerophospholipids is not well understood, and may vary depending on the cell type. We have described previously the biochemical characterization of the L. donovani MIL resistant line M-40 R. A 40-fold decrease in drug uptake was shown to be responsible for the resistant phenotype (10.Pérez-Victoria F.J. Castanys S. Gamarro F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 2397-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The inability to normally take up MIL in the resistant line was the direct result of a defect in the inward translocation of the drug (the movement from the outer to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane), because binding to the membrane, outward movement (efflux), drug metabolism, and bulk-phase endocytosis remained unaltered as compared with wild-type parasites. This resistant line is also defective in the inward-directed translocation of 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino (NBD)-glycerophospholipid analogs across the plasma membrane, suggesting that MIL uptake and lipid translocation may share the same transporter (10.Pérez-Victoria F.J. Castanys S. Gamarro F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 2397-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Reduced drug uptake has emerged as a common characteristic of drug-resistant trypanosomes, both in vitro and in vivo, enabling the molecular identification of drug transport systems (11.Maser P. Sutterlin C. Kralli A. Kaminsky R. Science. 1999; 285: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 12.Vasudevan G. Carter N.S. Drew M.E. Beverley S.M. Sanchez M.A. Seyfang A. Ullman B.

LdMT belongs to the aminophospholipid translocase (APT) subfamily and localizes to the plasma membrane. LdMT mediates MIL and NBD-glycerophospholipids translocation across the plasma membrane in Leishmania parasites. New functional insights into LdMT activity strongly suggest that certain APTs behave as true phospholipid translocases. Further, we establish that single but distinct point mutations within the two alleles of the LdMT locus are responsible for the resistant phenotype through inactivation of the protein. These results provide the first genetic and biochemical evidence of a protein directly involved in MIL uptake in eukaryotic cells and point to LdMT as a gene possibly responsible for treatment failure in the future.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—MIL was obtained from Zentaris (Frankfurt, Germany). Hexadecylphospho[1,2-ethylene-14C]choline ([14C]MIL) (1.33 MBq/mmol) was synthesized by Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, UK). 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine (edelfosine) was obtained from Calbiochem. 2-[6-(NBD)]-hexanoyl-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, -phosphoethanolamine, -phosphoserine (NBD-PC, -PE, -PS), and 6-[(NBD)-hexanoyl]sphingosylphosphocholine (NBD-SM) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL).

The Leishmania tarentolae wild-type line TarII described previously (14.White T.C. Fase-Fowler F. van Luenen H. Calafat J. Borst P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16977-16983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was cultured in the same medium. For determination of parasite sensitivity to MIL or edelfosine, 1 × 106 cells were incubated for 48 h at different drug concentrations before determining cell proliferation as described previously (15.Pérez-Victoria J.M. Pérez-Victoria F.J. Parodi-Talice A. Jimenez I.A. Ravelo A.G. Castanys S. Gamarro F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2468-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Transfection and Screening for MIL Sensitivity—To isolate cosmids containing the MIL transporter gene, eight independent transfections were performed as described previously (16.Ryan K.A. Dasgupta S. Beverley S.M. Gene. 1993; 131: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 17.Kundig C. Haimeur A. Legare D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). M-40 R stationary promastigotes were transfected with 10 μg of DNA from a cosmid library of genomic DNA from the L. donovani infantum strain LEM1317 cloned into the shuttle vector cLHYG (16.Ryan K.A. Dasgupta S. Beverley S.M. Gene. 1993; 131: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18.Lamontagne J. Papadopoulou B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6602-6609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). One day after transfection, the medium was supplemented with 40 μg/ml of hygromycin B, and 24 h later parasites were plated onto 1% agar plates containing culture medium plus 40 μg/ml hygromycin B. After 10-days incubation at 28 °C, isolated colonies were picked and transferred into 96-well microtiter plates containing culture medium plus 80 μg/ml hygromycin B. Aliquots from each well were inoculated into replica plates containing culture medium plus 40 μm MIL. Clones susceptible to 40 μm MIL were expanded from the master microtiter plate, and the cosmids were rescued from the transfectants by alkaline lysis. Approximately 8,000 transfectants were screened, yielding one clone (19D10) that sensitized Leishmania M-40 R to MIL.Isolation of LdMT, DNA Sequencing Analysis, and Construction of Plasmids—To localize LdMT within the 19D10 cosmid, restriction fragments were subcloned into the Leishmania expression shuttle vectors pX or cLHYG (16.Ryan K.A. Dasgupta S. Beverley S.M. Gene. 1993; 131: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19.LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9736-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The ∼7-kb BglII fragment (Fig. 1) containing the entire LdMT open reading frame (ORF) was completely sequenced on an ABI Prism 3100 DNA sequencer. For cloning and sequencing of the different LdMT alleles from the wild-type and M-40 R lines, PCR amplification was accomplished with two different sets of primers using the high fidelity Triple Master polymerase from Eppendorf. P1 (5′-GTAGATCTAAGAGCTGCGCAATTCATG) and P2 (5′-CATCTAGACCGTCATACAATCTTCACAGC) amplified only the coding region, whereas P3 (5′-GTAGATCTGTGCGTACGACACTTTG) and P4 (5′-GTTCTAGATTGTGCACTTCGACGATTCG) amplified the entire ORF, flanked by 714 and 685 bp of the untranslated 5′ and 3′ regions, respectively. BglII and XbaI restriction sites were added (underlined in the sequence) for further cloning. PCR-amplified bands were subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) for sequencing. The selected alleles were also subcloned into the BamHI-XbaI sites of the pX expression vector.To generate green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions at the carboxyl terminus of LdMT (LdMT-GFP), the ORF of the wild-type LdMT gene without the STOP codon was amplified by PCR by using forward and reverse primers containing BglII and SmaI sites, respectively. After restriction digestion, the ORF was subcloned in frame into the BamHI-EcoRV sites of the Leishmania expression vector pXG-GFP+′ (20.Ha D.S. Schwarz J.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).Inmunoblotting and Fluorescence Localization—Total cell lysates were prepared from wild-type and M-40 R parasites transfected with the LdMT-GFP construction and selected with increasing concentrations of G-418 as described (21.Parodi-Talice A. Araujo J.M. Torres C. Perez-Victoria J.M. Gamarro F. Castanys S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1612: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Immunoblots of comparable amounts of proteins were preformed with a polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:5000) (Molecular Probes) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit (1:5000) IgG (Sigma), as described previously (21.Parodi-Talice A. Araujo J.M. Torres C. Perez-Victoria J.M. Gamarro F. Castanys S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1612: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).For localization of the LdMT-GFP chimera, parasites were pelleted, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, attached to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, and fixed with 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Coverslips were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted on slides with Vectashield (Vecta Laboratoires Inc.). Images were acquired with a TCS-SP confocal microscope (Leica) and processed with the Leica Confocal Software and Adobe Photoshop.Southern Analysis and Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Analysis— Genomic DNA was purified from wild-type and M-40 R lines with the DNAzol reagent (Invitrogen). Restriction enzyme-digested DNA was hybridized to the LdMT ORF following standard procedures (22.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total cell RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Subsequently, 5 μg of total RNA was used to synthesize the first-strand cDNA with the SuperScript reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) and the LdMT-specific primer P2 described above, following the manufacturer's indications. PCR amplification of an internal LdMT sequence was performed by using primers P5 (5′-GTTACGCAACACGGACTG) and P6 (5′-CTAACCAGAATGCAGCTG).Functional Experiments—L. tarentolae TarII cells and L. donovani wild-type and M-40 R cells were transfected with either pX-LdMT (a construct containing P1-P2 amplified wild-type genomic DNA in the pX vector), pX-T420N (containing the P1-P2 T420N allele from M-40 R genomic DNA), pX-L856P (containing the L856P allele from M-40 R genomic DNA), or pX vector alone. The resulting transfectants were selected in medium containing G418 until a concentration of 200 μg/ml was reached. At that point, the internalization of [14C]MIL (1.33 MBq/mmol) or fluorescent-labeled phospholipid analogs was measured as described previously (10.Pérez-Victoria F.J. Castanys S. Gamarro F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 2397-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 107 promastigotes in culture medium were incubated with 0.09 μCi/ml [14C]MIL (2.5 μm) for 60 min at 28 °C. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline containing bovine serum albumin to allow for the removal of the drug fraction bound to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, followed by a second phosphate-buffered saline wash, both protein concentration and counts per minute were determined. With respect to NBD-phospholipid accumulation, 2 × 106/ml cells were preincubated with 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride before the direct addition of NBD analogs from an ethanol stock solution. After 30 min at 28 °C, parasites were spun down, washed as described above (including back-exchange with bovine serum albumin), and the intracellular fluorescence of 10,000 gated cells was acquired using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).Screening for Miltefosine Resistance in Mutagenized Parasites—1 × 108L. donovani wild-type promastigotes were treated with 1.2 μg/ml of ethylmethane sulfonate (Sigma) during 4 h in culture medium at 28 °C. The cells were then pelleted and washed twice in culture medium. This treatment resulted in less than 5% killing. Mutagenized cells were recovered for 24 h before being plated in semi-solid medium (1 × 107 per plate) containing 50 μm MIL. Resistant isolated colonies were picked after 6 days of incubation.RESULTSCloning of the Putative MIL Transporter by Functional Rescue of the MIL Sensitivity Phenotype—We isolated a putative MIL transporter by functional complementation in the M-40 R line using a cosmid genomic library from L. donovani infantum (18.Lamontagne J. Papadopoulou B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6602-6609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A number of cosmids were isolated and, upon retransfection, one cosmid (19D10) was able to bestow MIL sensitivity upon the M-40 R line. A restriction map of the 19D10 cosmid is shown in Fig. 1. To pinpoint the ORF within the cosmid that resensitizes cells to MIL, restriction fragments of cosmid 19D10 were subcloned into the Leishmania expression shuttle vectors pX or cLHYG, transfected back into the M-40 R line, and tested for restoration of MIL susceptibility. The smallest fragment still sensitizing resistant cells was a ∼7-kb BglII fragment. Its sequence revealed an ORF of 1097 amino acids and was given the name LdMT. A PCR product containing only the LdMT ORF was also able to rescue the MIL-sensitive phenotype in the M-40 R line (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Rescue of MIL and edelfosine sensitivity.L. donovani wild-type (circles) and M-40 R (inverted triangles) parasites transfected with either the pX-LdMT construct (white symbols) or the pX vector alone (black symbols) were assayed against MIL (A) or edelfosine (B) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Each point represents the mean of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Deduced Amino Acid Sequence of LdMT—Sequence analysis of LdMT revealed 28% amino acid identity and 47% homology with the human ATPase II (23.Mouro I.

We have established previously that NBD-glycerophospholipids and MIL are internalized in Leishmania parasites mainly by rapid transbilayer movement, a protein-mediated and energy-dependent process, independent of endocytosis (10.Pérez-Victoria F.J. Castanys S. Gamarro F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 2397-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 28.Araujo-Santos J.M. Castanys S. Gamarro F. Herrmann A. Pomorski T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Uptake assays using radiolabeled MIL or fluorescent-labeled NBD-phospholipid analogs demonstrated that LdMT was able to rescue inward translocation and thus to increase uptake of MIL (78-fold) (Fig. 4A), NBD-PC (35-fold), NBD-PE (14-fold), and NBD-PS (12-fold), but not NBD-SM in the M-40 R line (Fig. 4B). It also restored the normal sensitivity to MIL and edelfosine (Fig. 2). These results indicate that LdMT participates in the inward translocation machinery, which distinguishes sphingolipids from glycerolipids and recognizes only the latter as substrates for translocation across the plasma membrane, together with the non-glycerol based alkylphosphocholine MIL. This feature makes LdMT the phospholipid translocase with the broadest substrate specificity so far studied.Fig. 4Functional expression of LdMT alleles.L. donovani wild-type and M-40 R parasites and L. tarentolae TarII cells transfected with the pX vector (A, black bars) or the wild-type pX-LdMT construct (A, white bars) and resistant parasites transfected with the pX-T420N construct (A, gray bar) were assayed for internalization of [14C]MIL (A) or fluorescent-labeled phospholipid analogs (B) as described under “Materials and Methods.” (A) Cells were incubated with 2.5 μm [14C]MIL for 1 h at 28 °C, and radioactivity was measured. The results are shown as the mean and S.E. (error bars) of at least three independent experiments. (B) Fluorescence intensity histograms were obtained by flow cytometry analysis after incubation with 5 μm NBD-PC, 5 μm NBD-PE, 15 μm NBD-PS, or 5 μm NBD-SM for 30 min at 28 °C. Histograms from M-40 R parasites transfected with pX-T420N gave profiles similar to those for pX transfectants (results not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)One may still wonder whether LdMT is really a true translocase able to transport lipid analogs or just another member of the translocation machinery required for this activity. To gain further insight into this issue, we transfected wild-type L. donovani parasites with LdMT. Overexpression of LdMT increased the internalization of these phospholipid analogs (except NBD-SM) 2–5-fold as compared with control cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 4). A concomitant 2–3-fold increase was seen in sensitivity to MIL and edelfosine (Fig. 2). The increase in phospholipid uptake, both in wild-type and M-40 R parasites, correlated with the G418 selective pressure that controls plasmid copy number and thus the level of LdMT overexpression, as shown by Western blotting with a functional LdMT-GFP chimera (Fig. 5 and data not shown). These data further suggest that LdMT is not only involved in the translocation machinery, but that it is likely to be the direct MIL and glycerophospholipid transporter.Fig. 5Correlation between LdMT-GFP overexpression and the level of MIL uptake in L. donovani. M-40 R parasites transfected with the LdMT-GFP construction and selected at increasing concentrations of G-418 (top; 0 denotes non-transfected parasites) were assayed in parallel for immunoblotting of the LdMT-GFP chimera with anti-GFP and for the uptake of [14C]MIL (bottom; expressed as foldincrease as compared with non-transfected M-40 R parasites) as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)If LdMT were a true translocase, it should confer its biochemical activity to any other cell type lacking this function, as far as the system contains the elements required for proper functioning of the pump. The lizard parasite Leishmania tarentolae shows a natural resistance to alkylphosphocholines, with sensitivities one order of magnitude higher than those of the human parasites L. donovani, Leishmania tropica, Leishmania mexicana, or Leishmania panamensis (personal observations). We then tested MIL accumulation in L. tarentolae and found that this was 16-fold lower than that of L. donovani wild-type cells (Fig. 4A). Therefore, L. tarentolae parasites constitute an optimal system to study LdMT function. Expression of LdMT into L. tarentolae increased MIL uptake 20-fold (Fig. 4A), with the concomitant gain of MIL sensitivity (data not shown). These results demonstrate that LdMT, at least inside the Leishmania genetic background, behaves as a true translocase of lipid analogs, being the key factor modulating MIL uptake and potency.Cellular Localization of LdMT-GFP—To localize LdMT inside the cells, we constructed LdMT versions with a GFP tag at the carboxyl terminus. Tagging did not interfere with LdMT function, because M-40 R parasites expressing the chimera were able to rescue the transport-deficient phenotype (Fig. 5). Subcellular location of LdMT-GFP was monitored by using GFP fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 6, a significant portion of LdMT-GFP was localized to the plasma membrane but excluded from the flagellum. There was some labeling of the flagellar pocket area, which may reflect a secondary location or just protein trafficking.Fig. 6LdMT localizes to the plasma membrane in L. donovani.

The signal intensity and the restriction pattern in wild-type and M-40 R blots were similar, demonstrating that neither deletions nor rearrangement of the LdMT locus were responsible for the translocation-deficient phenotype on M-40 R cells. Reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments showed unique ethidium bromide-stained bands of the same intensity and expected size in both cell lines (Fig. 7B), indicating that loss of LdMT function in M-40 R cells is not caused by an alteration in RNA levels.

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a highly controlled process essential for many aspects of biological functions in multicellular organisms, including fetal development, maintenance of cellular homeostasis, and immune system regulation (1.Thompson C.B.

Excessive apoptosis is observed in many forms of degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, ischemic injury from stroke, and post-menopausal osteoporosis. On the other hand, down-regulation of apoptosis is often associated with cancer, autoimmune disorders, and persistent viral infections. Therefore, like cell survival and proliferation, cell death is a central point of intervention for the treatment of many human diseases. The major players of apoptotic cell death are caspases, a group of cysteine proteases that cleave after aspartate residues (5.Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar, 6.Denault J.B. Salvesen G.S. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4489-4500Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 7.Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar). Based on their preferential recognition of different substrate motifs, caspases can be divided into three groups. Although group I caspases are mostly involved in inflammation, group II and group III caspases comprise the effector (downstream) and initiator (upstream) caspases, respectively. Caspases are synthesized as single chain zymogens. During apoptosis, initiator caspases are recruited to multi-component and oligomeric signaling complexes and are activated by dimerization (8.Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H.

Activated initiator caspases in turn produce specific proteolytic cleavages to activate effector caspases. Cleaved mature caspases are dimeric enzymes with two active sites, comprising two large and two small subunits. Caspases are subject to inhibition by specific viral and cellular caspase inhibitors (9.Ekert P.G. Silke J. Vaux D.L.

XIAP is a prototypical member of the IAP family, which has been shown to directly inhibit both effector and initiator caspases (17.Holcik M. Gibson H. Korneluk R.G. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). XIAP possesses three BIR domains followed by a RING domain (Fig. 1A). Structural and biochemical studies revealed that the linker proceeding the BIR2 domain, in the context of a linker_BIR2 construct of XIAP, directly block the active sites of effector caspases such as caspase-3 and caspase-7 (18.Sun C.

In the linker_BIR2/caspase-7 structure, the BIR2 domain is completely disordered and does not contact the caspase. In the linker_BIR2/caspase-3 structure, the BIR2 domain interacts with a neighboring caspase in the crystal lattice, but the significance of the interaction in solution is unclear. The BIR3 domain is necessary and sufficient for inhibition of caspase-9, an initiator caspase in the mitochondrial cell death pathway, by sterically hindering caspase-9 dimerization (22.Shiozaki E.N.

The RING domain appears to act as a ubiquitin ligase for ubiquitination and degradation of IAPs and caspases (23.Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar, 24.Suzuki Y. Nakabayashi Y. Takahashi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8662-8667Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The BIR1 domain of XIAP has so far no ascribed function. Caspase inhibition by XIAP may be counteracted by Smac/DIABLO, a dimeric mitochondrial protein released into the cytosol during apoptosis (25.Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2870) Google Scholar, 26.Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). The biochemical basis of Smac function relies on a direct physical association with a groove on the surface of BIR domains of XIAP, mostly via a four-residue IAP-binding motif (AVPI) at the amino terminus of Smac (27.Chai J. Du C. Wu J.W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 28.Wu G. Chai J. Suber T.L. Wu J.W. Du C. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1E). Interestingly, part of the BIR3/caspase-9 interaction is mediated by the binding of the amino terminus of the small subunit of caspase-9 (ATPF) with the same BIR3 surface groove. Although a wealth of structural and biochemical data are available for XIAP, caspases and Smac, detailed quantitative biochemical and biophysical characterization of the system is lacking. An initial effort to fill this gap surprisingly revealed that linker_BIR2 interacts much more strongly with caspase-7 than with Smac. Furthermore, we found that even when bound with linker_BIR2, Smac does not effectively displace caspase-7, but rather forms a ternary complex with linker_BIR2 and caspase-7. These findings raise the question how and whether Smac could relieve effector caspase inhibition by XIAP. Here we report a series of experiments using GST pulldown, gel filtration chromatography, caspase activity assay, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and equilibrium ultracentrifugation. These experiments show that Smac is not only unable to effectively remove effector caspase inhibition by linker_BIR2, it is also inefficient in relieving caspase-9 inhibition by BIR3. On the other hand, Smac can efficiently antagonize inhibition of both effector and initiator caspases by constructs of XIAP containing both BIR2 and BIR3 domains. Although earlier studies have implied that BIR2 interacts only weakly with Smac (27.Chai J. Du C. Wu J.W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 28.Wu G. Chai J. Suber T.L. Wu J.W. Du C. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar), our affinity characterization shows that Smac interacts similarly with BIR2 and BIR3 domains. In addition, each Smac dimer interacts with the BIR2 and BIR3 domains of an XIAP molecule to form a 2:1 stoichiometric complex. This interaction not only possesses much enhanced affinity because of avidity, but it also provides steric hindrance to disallow the formation of an XIAP, caspase-7, and Smac ternary complex. Therefore, although the individual domains of XIAP are sufficient for caspase inhibition in vitro, both BIR2 and BIR3 domains are required for XIAP to interact with Smac and to release caspases from inhibition. Protein Expression and Purification—Various human XIAP fragments including BIR2 (residues 156–240), linker_BIR2 (residues 124–240), BIR1 (residues 1–135), BIR3 (residues 252–356), linker_BIR2_3 (residues 124–356), BIR1_2_3 (residues 1–356), BIR1_linker_BIR2 (1–240), and linker (124–158) were expressed as GST-fusion proteins using the pGEX-4T-3 vector (Amersham Biosciences). They were purified by glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography. To remove the GST tag, the GST fusion proteins were subjected to overnight thrombin cleavage on glutathione-Sepharose beads at room temperature using ∼1:200 molar ratios of enzyme to protein. The cleaved proteins were further purified by gel filtration chromatography. Full-length caspase-7, caspase-9, and Smac were expressed as C-terminally His-tagged proteins using the pET-28a vector (Novagen). They were purified by using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration. SPR Biosensor Measurement—All surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed at 20 °C using a BIACORE 2000 SPR-based biosensing system equipped with a research-grade B1 sensor chip. The immobilization buffer was 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.005% P20, pH 7.4; the running buffer was 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.005% P20, pH 7.5. The surfaces of four flow cells were activated for 1 min with a 1:1 mixture of 0.1 m N-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.1 m 3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl-N-ethylcarbodiimide at a flow rate of 20 μ l/min. Caspase-7 and Smac in 10 mm sodium acetate at pH 5.0 were immobilized at densities of 600–4000 response units on the sensor chip surface. The remaining activated groups were blocked with a 7-min injection of 1 m ethanolamine at pH 8.0. To collect kinetic binding data, concentration series of the XIAP analyte proteins in running buffer were injected over the ligand and reference flow cells at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. During each injection, the ligand/analyte complex was allowed to associate and dissociate for 30 and 60 s. When necessary, the caspase-7 and Smac surfaces were regenerated with a 5-s injection of 5 mm H3PO4. All response data were double referenced (30.Myszka D.G. J. Mol. Recognit. 1999; 12: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), and data were fit globally to a 1:1 interaction model (A + B = AB) using CLAMP (31.Myszka D.G. Morton T.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 149-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). GST Pulldown—GST-pulldown experiments were performed at room temperature. Purified GST-XIAP proteins and excess caspase-7 or caspase-9 were incubated with glutathione beads for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline buffer followed by three washes. Increasing amounts of Smac were then added to the beads and the mixture was incubated for another hour. After three washes, the bound proteins were eluted by 10 mm free reduced glutathione in phosphate-buffered saline. Gel Filtration Chromatography—Gel filtration experiments were performed with Superdex 200 (HR26/60, Amersham Biosciences). Caspase Activity Assay—Relief of XIAP-mediated caspase inhibition by Smac was monitored by enzyme progress curves (32.Xu G. Rich R.L. Steegborn C. Min T. Huang Y. Myszka D.G. Wu H. J. Biol.

The fluorogenic caspase substrates Ac-DEVD-AFC for caspase-7 and Ac-LEHD-AFC for caspase-9 were purchased from Enzyme Systems. Fluorescence detection upon substrate cleavage by caspases was carried out on a PerkinElmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer (plate reader) using an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and an emission wavelength of 505 nm. Caspase-7 (20 nm) or caspase-9 (200 nm), an XIAP construct (0.5 μm), and various concentrations of Smac (0.1 μm, 1 μm, 10 μm, and 100 μm) were mixed in 50-μl reactions in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% sucrose, and equilibrated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reactions were initiated by adding pre-warmed caspase-7 or caspase-9 substrate (200 μm) to the mixtures. Substrate hydrolyzes expressed as relative fluorescence units were monitored at 20-s intervals for 45 min. Equilibrium Ultracentrifugation—Equilibrium sedimentation of the Smac/linker_BIR2_3 complex was performed at 20 °C at 1 mg/ml concentration using an XL-A Optima analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) running at 11,000 rpm. Data were fit to a single species model (33.Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). The apparent molecular weight was calculated by assuming a partial specific volume of 0.74 ml/g and a solvent density of 1.045 g/ml. linker_BIR2/caspase-7 Interaction Is Much Stronger than linker_BIR2/Smac Interaction—To understand how Smac relieves the inhibition of effector caspases such as caspase-7 by XIAP, we characterized the interactions of XIAP with caspase-7 and Smac using SPR biosensor measurements (Table I). Dimeric caspase-7 and Smac were coupled to the sensor chips to avoid avidity effects during SPR experiments.Table ISPR Biosensor measurements of caspase-7/XIAP and Smac/XIAP interactions NB, no binding; ND, not determined.

The dissociation constant, as calculated from the kinetics of the interaction, was 1.0 nm. The BIR1_linker_BIR2 protein interacted with caspase-7 with equal affinity. Surprisingly, however, the linker_BIR2/Smac interaction exhibited a dissociation constant of 0.72 μm, which is 3 orders of magnitude weaker than the linker_BIR2/caspase-7 interaction. The weaker linker_BIR2/Smac interaction was mostly the result of a much faster off-rate (257-fold), as shown by comparing the kinetics of the interactions. The on-rates of the two interactions, on the other hand, are fairly similar (3-fold). These observations raise the question whether and how Smac would be able to remove caspase-7 from the grip of linker_BIR2. Smac Forms a Ternary Complex with Caspase-7 and linker_ BIR2 and Is Inefficient in Relieving Caspase-7 Inhibition by linker_BIR2—To determine whether Smac can effectively compete with caspase-7 for linker_BIR2 interaction, we first used GST-linker_BIR2-mediated pulldown experiments. GST-linker_BIR2 and excess of caspase-7 were incubated with reduced glutathione beads and washed with binding buffer to remove excess caspase-7. Smac was then added, followed by incubation, washing, and elution with free reduced glutathione. The resulting SDS-PAGE analyses of the bound proteins showed that even in the presence of excess Smac, most caspase-7 stayed bound with GST-linker_BIR2, suggesting that Smac is very inefficient in relieving caspase-7 from inhibition by linker_BIR2 (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, significant amounts of both Smac and caspase-7 were pulled down by GST-linker_BIR2 (Fig. 2A). To determine whether Smac, caspase-7, and linker_BIR2 exist as a ternary complex or as linker_BIR2/Smac and linker_BIR2/caspase-7 binary complexes, we performed a gel filtration experiment on a mixture of the linker_BIR2/caspase-7 complex and excess Smac. The experiment showed that approximately half of the linker_BIR2/caspase-7 complex co-eluted with Smac, demonstrating the formation of a ternary complex of linker_ BIR2/caspase-7/Smac (Fig. 2B). About equal amounts of the linker_BIR2/caspase-7 complex stayed as the binary complex, and only a tiny fraction of the linker_BIR2 was in a linker_ BIR2/Smac binary complex. Therefore, excess Smac not only did not effectively compete with the linker_BIR2/caspase-7 interaction to form linker_BIR2/Smac complex, it did not necessarily disrupt linker_BIR2/caspase-7 interaction, even when bound to linker_BIR2. This result is in contrast to the earlier suggestion that Smac sterically competes with linker_BIR2 for caspase-7 interaction (19.Chai J. Shiozaki E. Srinivasula S.M. Wu Q. Datta P. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Dataa P. Cell. 2001; 104: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 20.Huang Y. Park Y.C. Rich R.L. Segal D. Myszka D.G. Wu H. Cell. 2001; 104: 781-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is consistent with the structural observation that Smac and caspase-7 interact with different regions of the linker_BIR2 construct of XIAP (19.Chai J. Shiozaki E. Srinivasula S.M. Wu Q. Datta P. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Dataa P. Cell. 2001; 104: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 20.Huang Y. Park Y.C. Rich R.L. Segal D. Myszka D.G. Wu H. Cell. 2001; 104: 781-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas most of the linker_BIR2 is occupied by caspase-7. But, does it form a ternary complex? To determine whether the failure of Smac to effectively disrupt the linker_BIR2/caspase-7 interaction is translated into ineffective relief of linker_BIR2-mediated caspase-7 inhibition, we used enzyme kinetic analyses to determine the efficacy of Smac in relieving caspase-7 from linker_BIR2 inhibition (Fig. 2C). In the absence of Smac, linker_BIR2 inhibited caspase-7 enzymatic activity, as shown by the complete suppression of fluorescent substrate conversion. Increasing concentrations of Smac were ineffective in restoring caspase-7 activity. Even at a 200-fold excess of Smac (100 μm) versus linker_BIR2 (0.5 μm), only ∼20–25% of the caspase-7 activity was relieved. Smac Interacts with Both BIR2 and BIR3 Domains of XIAP—Having established that the linker_BIR2 region of XIAP is not sufficient for Smac regulation, we went on to determine whether other regions of XIAP may contribute to Smac interaction and, therefore, increase the sensitivity of XIAP-mediated caspase inhibition to Smac. SPR measurements between Smac and individual domains of XIAP, BIR1, BIR2, and BIR3 showed that both BIR2 and BIR3 domains interacted similarly with Smac (Table I). In contrast to the previous suggestion that BIR2 interacts weakly with Smac (27.Chai J. Du C. Wu J.W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 28.Wu G. Chai J. Suber T.L. Wu J.W. Du C. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar), these quantitative measurements showed that BIR2 domain interacts with Smac with at least an equal if not somewhat higher affinity. Smac Is Efficient in Relieving Caspase-7 Inhibition by XIAP Constructs Containing Both BIR2 and BIR3—Because both BIR2 and BIR3 domains interact with Smac, we used XIAP constructs containing both BIR2 and BIR3 domains and the linker_BIR2_3 and BIR1_2_3 proteins to assess the responsiveness to Smac. GST-XIAP-mediated pulldown experiments showed that Smac is much more efficient in liberating caspase-7 from interaction with linker_BIR2_3 and BIR1_2_3. At an approximately equal molar concentration, Smac removed almost all caspase-7 from interaction with GST-linker_BIR2_3. Similarly, Smac effectively removed caspase-7 from interaction with GST-BIR1_2_3 (Fig. 2D). Enzymatic kinetic analyses further showed that Smac is effective in relieving caspase-7 inhibition by linker_BIR2_3. Approximately 40% of the caspase-7 activity was restored in the presence of a mere 1 μm Smac, a 2-fold excess of linker_ BIR2_3 (0.5 μm). More than 80% restoration of caspase-7 activity was achieved in the presence of 10 μm Smac, and nearly complete restoration was achieved at 100 μm Smac. This result is in contrast to the 20% relief in the presence of 100 μm Smac for linker_BIR2-mediated caspase-7 inhibition (Fig. 2E). Smac Is Inefficient in Relieving BIR3-mediated Caspase-9 Inhibition—The observations that Smac is inefficient in releasing linker_BIR2-mediated caspase-7 inhibition and that both the BIR2 and BIR3 domains are required for efficient function of Smac prompted us to examine the effect of Smac on BIR3-mediated caspase-9 inhibition. Using GST-BIR3 pulldown experiments, we showed that caspase-9 could form a tight complex with BIR3. Because Smac binds to the same pocket on the surface of BIR3 as the N terminus of the small subunit of caspase-9, it is predicted that Smac should directly compete with caspase-9 for BIR3 interaction. Interestingly, the addition of approximate one-, two-, and 3-fold molar excess of Smac did not effectively remove caspase-9 from interaction with BIR3 (Fig. 3A). A majority of the caspase-9 stayed bound with BIR3, and significant amounts of both caspase-9 and Smac were pulled down by GST-BIR3 under these conditions. Unlike the situation with the linker_BIR2/caspase-7 complex, however, gel filtration analyses showed that BIR3, caspase-9, and Smac do not form a ternary complex but rather exist as two separate binary BIR3/caspase-9 and BIR3/Smac complexes (Fig. 3B). This finding is consistent with the overlapping binding sites for caspase-9 and Smac on the surface of BIR3. To determine whether the inefficiency in relieving caspase-9 interaction is translated into inefficient relief of caspase-9 inhibition, we used enzymatic analyses to determine the efficacy of Smac in relieving caspase-9 from BIR3 inhibition (Fig. 3C). In the absence of Smac, BIR3 completely inhibited caspase-9 enzymatic activity, as shown by the complete suppression of fluorescent substrate conversion. Increasing concentrations of Smac were ineffective in restoring caspase-9 activity. At a 20-fold molar excess of Smac (10 μm) versus BIR3 (0.5 μm), only ∼20% of caspase-9 activity was restored. Even at 200-fold excess of Smac (100 μm) versus BIR3 (0.5 μm), only ∼50% of the caspase-9 activity was relieved. Smac Is Efficient in Relieving Caspase-9 Inhibition by XIAP Constructs Containing Both BIR2 and BIR3—Because both BIR2 and BIR3 domains interact with Smac, we tested the responsiveness to Smac of XIAP constructs containing both the BIR2 and BIR3 domains and the linker_BIR2_3 and BIR1_2_3 proteins (Fig. 3D). GST-XIAP-mediated pulldown experiments showed that Smac is much more efficient in liberating caspase-9 from interaction with linker_BIR2_3 and BIR1_2_3. At an approximately equal molar concentration, Smac removed almost all caspase-9 from interaction with GST-linker_BIR2_3. Similarly, Smac effectively removed caspase-9 from interaction with GST-BIR1_2_3. Further, enzymatic kinetic analyses showed that Smac is effective in relieving caspase-9 inhibition by linker_BIR2_3 (Fig. 3E). Approximately 50% of the caspase-9 activity was restored in the presence of a mere 1 μm Smac, a 2-fold excess of linker_BIR2_3. Almost complete restoration of caspase-9 activity was achieved in the presence of 10 μm or more Smac. This result is in contrast to the 50% relief in the presence of 100 μm Smac for BIR3-mediated caspase-9 inhibition. Smac Dimer Forms a 2:1 High Affinity Complex with XIAP by Interacting Simultaneously with the BIR2 and BIR3 Domains of an XIAP Molecule—Because of the affinity of Smac for both BIR2 and BIR3 domains and the dimeric nature of Smac, it may be expected that Smac dimer interacts with the BIR2 and BIR3 domains of XIAP and forms a 2:1 stoichiometric complex. However, previous studies have suggested that XIAP may dimerize (27.Chai J. Du C. Wu J.W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), which could create many possibilities of interaction stoichiometry. To determine the stoichiometric state of a Smac/XIAP complex, we used the linker_BIR2_3 construct containing BIR2 and BIR3, and isolated a Smac/linker_BIR2_3 complex by gel filtration chromatography. The complex was then subjected to equilibrium ultracentrifugation (Fig. 4A), from which a molecular mass of 63 kDa was derived. This finding is consistent with a 2:1 stoichiometry of Smac/linker_BIR2_3 complex with a calculated molecular mass of 71 kDa. Using the crystal structures of the Smac dimer (27.Chai J. Du C. Wu J.W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) and the complex between a mutant Smac monomer and BIR3 (28.Wu G. Chai J. Suber T.L. Wu J.W. Du C. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar), a dimeric Smac/BIR3 model was constructed. Then, one of the BIR3 molecules in the model was replaced by a crystal structure of the BIR2 domain (21.Riedl S.J. Renatus M. Schwarzenbacher R. Zhou Q. Sun C. Fesik S.W. Liddington R.C. Salvesen G.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) to generate a Smac/BIR2_3 complex (Fig. 4B). In the model, the BIR2 and BIR3 domains come from a single XIAP molecule, because the C-terminal end of the BIR2 domain (residue 237) lies close to the N-terminal end of the BIR3 domain (residue 256). Strikingly, SPR measurement showed that linker_BIR2_3 interacted with Smac with much higher affinity (Fig. 4C and Table I). The derived dissociation constant is 0.3 nm, which is comparable or stronger than the XIAP/caspase-7 interaction and, therefore, would be poised to compete with the XIAP/caspase-7 interaction. Similarly, the increased affinity would enhance the ability of Smac to remove XIAP from inhibiting caspase-9. linker_BIR2_3/Smac Interaction Sterically Hinders linker_ BIR2_3/caspase-7 Interaction—The higher affinity of linker_ BIR2_3/Smac interaction could readily explain the enhanced ability of Smac to relieve caspase-9 from inhibition by XIAP constructs containing both BIR2 and BIR3 domains. However, the issue for the disruption of the caspase-7/linker_BIR2_3 interaction by Smac is more complex because Smac and caspase-7 interact directly with different regions of XIAP. The most likely explanation is that the simultaneous interaction of Smac with both BIR2 and BIR3 domains sterically hinders the interaction of the linker with caspase-7 (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, in the absence of BIR3, the linker/caspase-7 interaction could occur concurrently with BIR2/Smac interaction to form a ternary linker_BIR2/caspase-7/Smac complex in which one of the Smac monomers in the Smac dimer is not bound with a BIR domain. The role of BIR3 here may be analogous to the role of a second linker_BIR2 molecule bound to a Smac dimer. It has been proposed previously that the binding of a second linker_BIR2 molecule to the Smac dimer may create a steric hindrance for caspase-7 (19.Chai J. Shiozaki E. Srinivasula S.M. Wu Q. Datta P. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Dataa P. Cell. 2001; 104: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). However, because this weak second linker_BIR2/Smac interaction competes with the strong linker_BIR2/caspase-7 interaction, it is a rare event, and this explains the inefficient competition of Smac to remove caspase-7 from linker_BIR2. On the other hand, the strong linker_BIR2_3/Smac interaction efficiently removes caspase-7 from XIAP. Domains of XIAP Coordinate to Sense Smac Regulation—XIAP is a multi-talented molecule that puts brakes on apoptosis by means of several different mechanisms (34.Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). In vitro, each of these anti-apoptotic mechanisms of XIAP seems to be mediated exclusively by a different region of the molecule. For example, linker_BIR2 seems to be both necessary and sufficient for the inhibition of caspase-7 or caspase-3, whereas BIR3 mediates caspase-9 inhibition. However, for Smac regulation, individual domains of BIR2 or BIR3, although having the ability to interact with Smac, are not sufficient for Smac to relieve either caspase-7 or caspase-9 from the grip of linker_BIR2 or BIR3, respectively. In this case, both BIR2 and BIR3 domains are required for XIAP to respond to Smac regulation. Interestingly, in the context of the apoptosome, XIAP seems to associate simultaneously with both caspase-9 and caspase-3, and the ability of XIAP to maintain inhibition of caspase-9 is influenced by its ability to simultaneously inhibit caspase-3 (29.Bratton S.B. Lewis J. Butterworth M. Duckett C.S. Cohen G.M. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Therefore, in vivo, for both caspase inhibition and Smac regulation, the different domains of XIAP cooperate to achieve more effective inhibition and sensitive regulation.

We previously demonstrated, using in vitro antisense experiments, that FATP4 is required for fatty acid uptake into intestinal epithelial cells. To further examine the physiological role of FATP4, mice carrying a targeted deletion of FATP4 were generated. Deletion of one allele of FATP4 resulted in 48% reduction of FATP4 protein levels and a 40% reduction of fatty acid uptake by isolated enterocytes. However, loss of one FATP4 allele did not cause any detectable effects on fat absorption on either a normal or a high fat diet. Deletion of both FATP4 alleles resulted in embryonic lethality as crosses between heterozygous FATP4 parents resulted in no homozygous offspring; furthermore, no homozygous embryos were detected as early as day 9.5 of gestation. Early embryonic lethality has been observed with deletion of other genes involved in lipid absorption in the small intestine, namely microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and apolipoprotein B, and has been attributed to a requirement for fat absorption early in embryonic development across the visceral endoderm. In mice, the extraembryonic endoderm supplies nutrients to the embryo prior to development of a chorioallantoic placenta. In wild-type mice we found that FATP4 protein is highly expressed by the epithelial cells of the visceral endoderm and localized to the brush-border membrane of extraembryonic endodermal cells.

Gene (Amst.). 2001; 270: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that FATPs are acyl-CoA ligases that directly couple LCFA uptake with CoA activation, thereby trapping fatty acids inside the cell. Dietary fatty acids contribute ∼30–40% of the calories in a normal Western diet (23.Clandinin M.T. FEBS Lett. 1979; 102: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Inhibition of fat absorption, by blocking generation of fatty acid from lipids with pancreatic lipase inhibitors (25.Eldridge A.L. Cooper D.A. Peters J.C. Obes. Rev. 2002; 3: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 26.Keating G.M. Jarvis B. Drugs. 2001; 61: 2107-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), has been shown to be an effective treatment for obesity and to improve obesity-associated disorders, such as cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance (24.Jequier E. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2002; 26: S12-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). An alternative or additional treatment, which may result in an improved side effect profile, could be direct inhibition of fatty acid uptake, which could be theoretically achieved by blocking FATP4 function. In this study, we attempted to better understand the function of FATP4 in vivo by engineering a FATP4 null mutation through deletion of the first two exons in the murine gene. We found that homozygous deletion of the FATP4 gene resulted in early embryonic lethality and that FATP4 protein was expressed during early post-implantation development in the yolk sac, suggesting a critical role for FATP4 in the maternalfetal transport of fatty acids. Generation of the FATP4 Deletion Allele—129/Sv genomic library was obtained from Research Genetics and the targeting vector was based on pGEM from Promega. A 577-nucleotide fragment ending 37 base pairs upstream of the 5′ arm and a 599-nucleotide fragment starting 444 bp downstream of the 3′ arm were generated by PCR amplification, subcloned into a shuttle vector, and used as probes for Southern blots. 129SvEv ES cells were cultured on SNL76/7 mitotically inactive feeder cells as described by Robertson (27.Robertson E.J. Robertson, E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987Google Scholar). Electroporation of the cells was performed as described by Huszar et al. (28.Huszar D. Lynch C.A. Fairchild-Huntress V. Dunmore J.H. Fang Q. Berkemeier L.R. Gu W. Kesterson R.A. Boston B.A. Cone R.D. Smith F.J. Campfield L.A. Burn P. Lee F.

G418-resistant clones were screened by Southern blot hybridization using 5′ and 3′ flanking probes to confirm recombination. ES cell clones that had undergone homologous recombination were injected into blastocysts, which were then transferred to pseudopregnant female mice to generate chimeric offspring. Male chimeras were mated with C57Bl/6J females to obtain germline transmission of the disrupted FATP4 gene. The resulting heterozygotes were interbred to generate additional offspring. Genotyping of offspring was performed using a PCR genotyping assay. Western Blotting and Immunofluorescence—FATP4 protein levels were determined in enterocytes of five male wild-type and heterozygous litter pairs. Enterocyte lysates were prepared from ad lib fed mice as previously described (15.Stahl A. Hirsch D.J. Gimeno R. Punreddy S. Ge P. Watson N. Kotler M. Tartaglia L.A. Lodish H.F. Mol.

Immunofluorescence was performed using embryos from timed-pregnant C57Bl/6J mice. 8 days after conception mice were anesthetized with Isoflurane and sacrificed. Embryos were removed from the uterus, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, and cryoprotected by overnight incubation in Hanks' buffered salt solution containing 30% sucrose and 10% OCT (optimal cutting temperature, Tissue-Tek, Sakura). Fresh-frozen sections of embryos were stained and imaged on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope as previously described (14.Gimeno R.E. Ortegon A.M. Patel S. Punreddy S. Ge P. Lodish H.F. Stahl A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16039-16044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Animal Experiments—Embryos at different stages of development were obtained by dissecting pregnant females. The appearance of a vaginal plug was counted as day 0.5 of pregnancy. Phenotyping experiments were performed using male animals at the indicated ages. Animals were fed standard lab chow or a high fat diet containing 58 kcal % fat from hydrogenated coconut oil (D12330, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ). To examine the acute effects of high fat feeding, 200 μl of corn oil (Sigma) was administered to animals twice a day by oral gavage while allowing free access to chow diet and water. Fat and lean mass was determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry using a PIXImus mouse densitometer (Lunar Corp., Madison, WI). Fecal fat was measured by extracting dried feces with 1:3.3:4 volumes of H2O: chloroform:methanol, and determining the weight of the dried organic phase. Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. The Millennium and PAMFRI IACUC committees approved all animals and procedures. Enterocyte Isolation and Bodipy-Fatty Acid Uptake Assays—Enterocytes from female 6-month-old C57Bl/6J mice were isolated as previously described (15.Stahl A. Hirsch D.J. Gimeno R. Punreddy S. Ge P. Watson N. Kotler M. Tartaglia L.A. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In brief, small intestines (duodenum, ileum, and jejunum) were removed, rinsed with Hanks' buffered salt solution (Invitrogen), cut into ∼1-cm long sections, and incubated in 50 ml of Hanks' buffered salt solution containing 0.1 m sucrose (Bio-Rad) and 20 mm EDTA. Intestinal sections were gently stirred for 10 min. The Targeted Deletion of FATP4 Causes Embryonic Lethality—Genomic DNA containing the mouse FATP4 locus was obtained by screening a 129/Sv genomic bacterial artificial chromosome library with a fragment containing the 5′ end of the mouse FATP4 coding sequence and subcloning FATP4-containing fragments into a shuttle vector. 11 kb of genomic DNA covering the first two coding exons of FATP4 were sequenced. A 5′ and a3′ arm for homologous recombination were then generated by PCR amplification of 3.05 kb of genomic DNA just upstream of the initiation codon (5′ arm) and 5.48 kb of genomic DNA 1,285 nucleotides downstream of the 2nd coding exon (3′ arm). The sequence of the 5′ and 3′ arms as well as the presence of the restriction sites was confirmed by sequencing. Arms were subcloned into the targeting vector pGEMneolacz, a pGEM-based vector containing a PGK-neo expression cassette as well as a promoter-less lacZ gene containing a nuclear localization sequence (29.Mercer E.H. Hoyle G.W. Kapur R.P. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Neuron. 1991; 7: 703-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The PCR primers were designed to introduce an EcoRI site at the 3′ end of the 5′ arm and a SacI site at the 5′ end of the 3′ arm (Fig. 1A) allowing for detection of recombination events by Southern blot (Fig. 1B). The correct recombination event results in the removal of exons 1 and 2 deleting the first 185 amino acids of the FATP4 protein. Whereas heterozygous mice were born at the expected frequencies, we were unable to generate homozygous knockout mice (Table I). From 15 different heterozygous mating pairs we obtained a total of 332 offspring, none of which were homozygous for the FATP4 deletion allele. Heterozygous mating pairs bred well and produced an average litter size of 8 pups; as expected by Mendelian distribution, heterozygous and wild-type mice were present at a ratio of 2:1. To address the possibility of neonatal lethality, the cages of pregnant animals were inspected daily and any dead pups were removed, visually examined, and genotyped. We found only a small number of non-viable offspring, which appeared phenotypically normal; none of these pups were homozygous for the FATP4 deletion allele. We therefore conclude that targeted deletion of FATP4 results in embryonic lethality.Table IGenotype of offspring from FATP4 heterozygote matings Observed and, for embryonic lethality, expected distribution of F1 offspring from FATP4 heterozygote matings.Total number genotyped: 332Genotype+/+Male, 190 +/-Female, 142 -/-Observed1052270Expected1112210 Open table in a new tab FATP4 Heterozygosity Causes Reduced Enterocyte LCFA Uptake but Does Not Affect Lipid Absorption in Vivo—Mice carrying one copy of the FATP4 deletion allele had an average 48% decrease in FATP4 protein levels in their intestinal epithelial cells (Fig. 2A). All other FATP family members remained undetectable by Western blot (data not shown). Isolated primary enterocytes from FATP4 heterozygote animals also showed a significant 40% reduction in the average rate of Bodipy-FA uptake (Fig. 2B). To examine the in vivo consequences of this decrease in FATP4 protein levels and LCFA uptake rates, we performed two sets of experiments. In the first experiment, we placed 7-week-old male wild-type and FATP4 heterozygous littermates on a high fat diet for 10 weeks and recorded body weight and food intake on a weekly basis. At the end of the experiment, we collected feces, and then measured the body composition using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. We found no differences between wild-type and FATP4 heterozygous mice in any of the parameters measured (Table II). To examine the effects of an acute challenge with high fat, 200 μl of corn oil was administered to chow-fed wild-type and FATP4 heterozygous animals twice a day for 2 days, and the effect on fecal fat content was determined. As expected, administration of corn oil resulted in a significant increase in fecal fat during the first 24 h. Importantly, wild-type and FATP4 heterozygous mice showed a similar increase (Table III). Thus, 52% of the wild-type FATP4 protein levels appear to be sufficient for normal fat absorption in the small intestine.Table IIHigh fat challenge of FATP4 wild-type and heterozygote mice Age-matched littermates were weighed at 7 weeks of age and then placed on a high-fat diet.

We were unable to obtain any homozygous FATP4 knockout mice as early as day 9.5 of gestation. The absence of homozygous knockout mice is significant for embryos younger than day 11.5 of gestation (p < 0.05 using Chi square analysis) and highly significant for embryos younger than day 15.5 of gestation (p < 0.01). Our attempts to genotype embryos earlier than day 9.5 of gestation were unsuccessful because of contamination of dissected early stage embryos with maternal tissues that compromised the PCR-based genotyping assay.Table IVGenotyping of embryos from FATP4 heterozygote matings Timed-pregnant mice were sacrificed at the indicated number of days post-conception and embryos were dissected away from maternal tissues.

Immunofluorescent staining of similar sections through day 8 embryos with FATP4-specific antibodies showed that FATP4 was also expressed by both tissues (Fig. 3B). More detailed confocal fluorescent microscopy examinations revealed that embryonic FATP4 expression was restricted to the extraembryonic visceral endoderm, a layer of columnar/cuboidal cells with characteristic actin-rich brush-border membranes (Figs. 3C and 4) and apical vacuoles (Fig. 4B). FATP4 protein in the extraembryonic endodermal cells was restricted in its subcellular localization to the apical brush-border membrane (Figs. 3C and 4) reminiscent of the FATP4 localization to apical brush-border membranes in the adult intestine (15.Stahl A.

Metab. 2001; 12: 266-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar for a more detailed review). FATP4 is expressed by several tissues including small intestine, brain, liver, kidney, skin, and heart (10.Hirsch D. Stahl A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8625-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 22.Herrmann T. Buchkremer F. Gosch I. Hall A.M. Bernlohr D.A. Stremmel W.

A. 2003; 100: 5274-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that FATP4 enhances fatty acid uptake when overexpressed in cell lines and is the major FATP in the small intestine (15.Stahl A. Hirsch D.J. Gimeno R. Punreddy S. Ge P. Watson N. Kotler M. Tartaglia L.A. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). FATP4 has also been demonstrated to possess long-chain and very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase activity (22.Herrmann T. Buchkremer F. Gosch I. Hall A.M. Bernlohr D.A. Stremmel W. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 270: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and may therefore mediate uptake through metabolic activation of fatty acids. In our attempt to further investigate the role of FATP4 in the absorption of dietary lipids and fatty acid transport by generating targeted deletions of the FATP4 gene we uncovered a novel function for FATP4 during early embryonic development in the mouse. Not one, of 332 genotyped pups from FATP4 heterozygote mating pairs, showed a homozygote deletion of the FATP4 allele. We also were unable to detect any FATP4 null embryos between developmental days 9.5 to 19.5, indicating a severe early embryonic defect caused by the complete loss of FATP4 function. Partial loss of FATP4 function during development, however, did not affect viability, because the frequency of heterozygote offspring was as predicted. We have previously shown that FATP4 is the principal FATP in the small intestine (15.Stahl A. Hirsch D.J. Gimeno R. Punreddy S. Ge P. Watson N. Kotler M. Tartaglia L.A. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and that reduction of FATP4 protein levels via antisense oligonucleotide treatment resulted in reduced LCFA uptake by isolated enterocytes (15.Stahl A. Hirsch D.J. Gimeno R. Punreddy S. Ge P. Watson N. Kotler M. Tartaglia L.A. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, we have shown here that isolated enterocytes from FATP4 heterozygote mice have both reduced FATP4 protein levels and LCFA uptake rates. The 48% reduction in FATP4 protein levels observed in heterozygote mice did not, however, translate into an observable phenotype, as body composition, weight changes, and fecal fat content in FATP4 heterozygote mice were not significantly different from wild-type littermates. The 40% reduction in enterocyte LCFA uptake may not have been sufficient to impact overall absorption because of the large capacity of the small bowel for lipid uptake. Similarly, the gastric and pancreatic lipase inhibitor, Orlistat, only affects lipid absorption and weight gain after inhibiting more than 90% of lipase activity (31.Sternby B. Hartmann D. Borgstrom B. Nilsson A. Clin. Nutr. 2002; 21: 395-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Maternal to fetal transport of essential and non-essential fatty acids plays an important role during embryonic development (32.Innis S.M. Sprecher H. Hachey D. Edmond J. Anderson R.E. Lipids. 1999; 34: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 33.Dutta-Roy A. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2000; 71: 315S-322SCrossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In mice and rats, the yolk sac is the primary interface for nutrient exchange before the development of a functional chorioallantoic placenta (days 9 to 10) (34.Jollie W.P. Teratology. 1990; 41: 361-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The inner layer of the yolk sac is comprised of the visceral endoderm, a columnar layer of cells with an apical brush-border membrane that is responsible for the absorption of nutrients coming from maternal blood sinuses, and trophoblasts surrounding the Reichert's membrane (34.Jollie W.P. Teratology. 1990; 41: 361-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that FATP4 is highly expressed by this cell layer by embryonic day 8 and targeted predominantly to the brush-border membrane. Thus, a likely cause for the observed embryonic lethality of FATP4 null animals is an insufficient embryonic absorption and/or activation of maternal saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. This hypothesis is indirectly supported by the observation that deletions of two other proteins that are expressed by the yolk sac and are involved in lipid metabolism, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and apolipoprotein B, both lead to early embryonic lethality (35.Raabe M. Flynn L.M. Zlot C.H. Wong J.S. Veniant M.M. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8686-8691Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 36.Farese Jr., R.V. Cases S. Ruland S.L. Kayden H.J. Wong J.S. Young S.G. Hamilton R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 347-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas MTP and apoB deletions impair the formation and basolateral secretion of nascent very low density lipoprotein particles from the visceral endodermal cells, loss of FATP4 function could result in a reduced absorption of fatty acids from hydrolyzed maternal lipids on the apical site of the cells. All three mutations would result in severely reduced levels of lipids and essential fatty acids reaching the embryo. During the preparation of this manuscript, two publications have also reported mouse strains with FATP4 loss of function due either to a spontaneous transposon insertion in exon 3 (30.Moulson C.L. Martin D.R. Lugus J.J. Schaffer J.E. Lind A.C. Miner J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5274-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), or by targeted disruption of exon 3 via homologous recombination (37.Herrmann T. Van Der Hoeven F. Grone H.J. Stewart A.F. Langbein L. Kaiser I. Liebisch G. Gosch I. Buchkremer F. Drobnik W. Schmitz G. Stremmel W. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Both groups report that FATP4 null mice are viable at birth but die within days, because of a phenotype reminiscent of restrictive dermopathy with tight, wrinkle-free skin and disrupted skin barrier function (30.Moulson C.L. Martin D.R. Lugus J.J. Schaffer J.E. Lind A.C. Miner J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5274-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 37.Herrmann T. Van Der Hoeven F. Grone H.J.

The exact reasons behind the observed discrepancies in the FATP4 null phenotype are unclear. Because our FATP4 null mice were based on a single ES clone, it is a formal possibility that an unrelated mutation in this clone occurred and is causal for the embryonic lethality. However, chances of this occurring seem remote because the hypothetical mutation would have to be in close linkage to the FATP4 locus given that not a single FATP4 homozygote mouse of 400 genotyped mice was observed. Furthermore, independent commercial efforts to create targeted deletions of the FATP4 gene also resulted in embryonic lethality. 2R. Phillips, personal communication. Other possible explanations include genetic strain differences, and the fact that our targeting construct deleted exons 1 and 2, whereas in both non-lethal FATP4 mutations, the first two exons were left intact, leaving the possibility that abbreviated FATP4 fusion proteins are produced. Whereas it is highly speculative that the first 185 amino acids encoded by exons 1 and 2 would present a peptide with biological activity, it is worthwhile noting that this region is homologous to fragments of FATP1 that would include the entire extracellular N terminus, the transmembrane region, and cytoplasmic membrane-associated sequences (38.Lewis S.E. Listenberger L.L. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37042-37050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Because FATPs may be multifunctional proteins with separable residues involved in LCFA transport and activation (39.Zou Z. DiRusso C.C. Ctrnacta V. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31062-31071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the hypothetical fusion proteins could retain some aspects of FATP4 function, such as LCFA transport, or interaction with other proteins, for instance long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (40.Zou Z.

Although the causes of neonatal mortality, described by Moulson et al. (30.Moulson C.L. Martin D.R. Lugus J.J. Schaffer J.E. Lind A.C. Miner J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The serine protease HtrA2/Omi has an amino-terminal IAP interaction motif like that found in Reaper, which displaces IAPs from caspases, leading to enhanced caspase activity. The cell death-promoting properties of HtrA2/Omi are not only exerted through its capacity to oppose IAP inhibition of caspases but also through its integral serine protease activity. We have used peptide libraries to determine the optimal substrate sequence for cleavage by HtrA2 and also the preferred binding sequence for its PDZ domain. Using these peptides, we show that the PDZ domain of HtrA2/Omi suppresses the proteolytic activity unless it is engaged by a binding partner. Subjecting HtrA2/Omi to heat shock treatment also increases its protease activity. Unexpectedly, binding of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) to the Reaper motif of HtrA2/Omi results in a marked increase in proteolytic activity, suggesting a new role for IAPs. When HtrA2/Omi is released from mitochondria following an apoptotic stimulus, binding to IAPs may switch their function from caspase inhibition to serine protease activation. Thus although IAP overexpression can suppress caspase activation, it could have the opposite effect on HtrA2/Omi-dependent cell death. This, together with the ability of HtrA2/Omi to degrade IAPs, may limit the overall cellular protection that can be provided by these proteins.

Unexpectedly, binding of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) to the Reaper motif of HtrA2/Omi results in a marked increase in proteolytic activity, suggesting a new role for IAPs. When HtrA2/Omi is released from mitochondria following an apoptotic stimulus, binding to IAPs may switch their function from caspase inhibition to serine protease activation. Thus although IAP overexpression can suppress caspase activation, it could have the opposite effect on HtrA2/Omi-dependent cell death. This, together with the ability of HtrA2/Omi to degrade IAPs, may limit the overall cellular protection that can be provided by these proteins.

They appear to be able to act through a similar mechanism to the fly Reaper proteins by interacting with IAPs through their Reaper motifs, which are critical for the interaction with IAPs.In mammalian cells, apoptotic stimuli result in the release of Smac and HtrA2 from the intermembrane space of the mitochondria into the cytosol, along with other apoptosis regulatory molecules such as cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor, and endonuclease G (10.van Loo G. Saelens X. van Gurp M. MacFarlane M. Martin S.J. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1031-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Since IAPs are localized in the cytosol, the release of Smac and HtrA2 will result in displacement of IAPs from caspases and loss of their suppressive effect on caspase activity. Despite the general acceptance of this model, the physiological importance of these Reaper motif proteins in the regulation of mammalian cell death is still unclear. For example, deletion of the Smac gene in mice has no detectable phenotype (11.Okada H. Suh W.K. Jin J. Woo M. Du C. Elia A. Duncan G.S. Wakeham A. Itie A. Lowe S.W. Wang X. Mak T.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 3509-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Little else is known about the function of Smac, and clear homologues have not been characterized in invertebrate species.However, HtrA2 belongs to the HtrA family serine proteases, which is found across eukaryotic and prokaryotic species (12.Clausen T. Southan C. Ehrmann M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 443-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli periplasmic enzyme DegP/HtrA has chaperone function at low temperature and protease function at elevated temperature (13.Spiess C. Beil A. Ehrmann M. Cell. 1999; 97: 339-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). It appears that the enzyme acts to chaperone unfolded proteins, possibly contributing to their refolding, and degrades them only at high temperatures, when the amount of unfolded protein in the cell is greatly increased. HtrA2 is the only member of the family of four mammalian HtrA proteases that has been found in the mitochondria and the only one that has been shown to be processed to reveal a Reaper-like amino-terminal motif. All HtrA family members have one or more PDZ motifs, domains that bind to carboxyl-terminal sequences of partner proteins.Previous studies (5.Verhagen A.M. Silke J. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Kaufmann H.

The serine protease activity of exogenously expressed HtrA2 when localized in the cytosol is sufficient to cause an “atypical” caspase-independent cell death. It is therefore possible that the protease activity of HtrA2 plays a significant, perhaps even dominant, role in its regulation of cell death. In this work, we have characterized the specificity of the HtrA2 protease activity with a view to generating reagents that will enable investigation of the molecular details of the regulation of this enzyme. We have also investigated the specificity of the PDZ domain of HtrA2 and shown that binding of peptides to this region leads to activation of the protease. In addition, binding of XIAP to HtrA2 is unexpectedly shown to activate its protease activity. It appears that although IAPs inhibit the activity of cysteine protease caspases, they have the opposite effect on this serine protease implicated in caspase-independent cell death. The ability of IAPs to block cell death may therefore be limited, even at high levels of expression.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—Recombinant full-length XIAP, BIR domains, and Smac proteins were purchased from R&D Systems; peptide libraries, H2-optimal substrate (Mca-IRRVSYSF(Dnp)KK (where Mca is 7-methoxycoumarin-4-acetic acid and Dnp is N-dinitrophenyldiaminopropionic acid)), self-cleavage substrate (Mca-AVLAAVPS(Dnp)KK), PDZ-Opt peptide (biotin-GQYYFV-COOH), and PDZ-sub-peptide (biotin-GGIRRV-COOH) and PDZ-sub-amide peptide (biotin-GGIRRVCONH2) were synthesized at the Tufts University Core Facility. Anti-HtrA2 antiserum (MM-1) was produced by immunizing rabbits with human recombinant Δ133HtrA2 by Harlan Bioproducts. Anti-XIAP monoclonal antibody (catalogue number H62120) was obtained from Transduction Laboratories.Production of Recombinant Proteins—Mature, carboxyl-terminal His6-tagged HtrA2 proteins (Δ133HtrA2 and Δ 133HtrA2 Δ PDZ) in pET-20b and pET-24b (Novagen) were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). The PDZ domain was deleted by removing the carboxyl terminus of HtrA2, amino-acids 350–445. Protein expression was induced by culturing cells at 16 °C for 16 h in the presence of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were lysed by freezing and thawing in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1%(v/v) Triton X-100). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatants were incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. Bound protein was washed with wash buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl 10 mm imidazole, 20%(v/v) glycerol). Elution was performed using an imidazole gradient (20–300 mm) in elution buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 20%(v/v) glycerol). Eluted protein was dialyzed overnight against storage buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 20%(v/v) Glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. Activity of bacterially produced HtrA2 was initially assessed by zymography using Novex Zymogram (Blue Casein) gels (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. It should be noted that due to the lack of an effective HtrA2 inhibitor, active site titration was not performed on the Δ133HtrA2 and Δ 133HtrA2 Δ PDZ enzyme preparations. Although it is possible that significantly different levels of enzyme active sites were present in the two preps, the identical purification regimen makes this relatively unlikely.The PDZ domain of human HtrA2 (amino acids 350–459) was PCR-amplified and cloned into the pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences). GST and GST-PDZ were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 Codon Plus (DE3)RIL (Stratagene). Protein expression was induced by culturing cells at 37 °C for 3 h in the presence of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000× g for 15 min. Supernatants were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Bound protein was washed with PBS and stored in storage buffer (50%(v/v) glycerol in PBS) at -20 °C.Peptide Library Methods—The cleavage site motif for HtrA2 was determined by amino-terminal sequencing of the reaction products of peptide library mixtures as described previously (15.Turk B.E. Huang L.L. Piro E.T. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Briefly, primed positions were determined by digesting 1 nmol of the library Ac-XXX (where X is an isokinetic mixture of the 19 naturally occurring amino acids excluding cysteine) to 5% completion with mature HtrA2 in 10 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl at 37 °C. The digest was sequenced on an automated Edman sequencer. Selectivity values for each amino acid were determined by dividing the molar proportion present in a given sequencing cycle by the proportion present in the starting mixture. For the unprimed positions, biotinylated peptide libraries XXXXSYSFKK(biotin) and GXXXVSYSFKK(biotin) were digested with HtrA2 as above. Carboxyl-terminal fragments and remaining uncleaved peptides were removed from the reaction mixture with avidin agarose, and the amino-terminal cleavage products were subjected to Edman sequencing as above.The PDZ-binding motif was determined by affinity isolation of peptides from the library KNXXXXXXXX as done previously (16.Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). The peptide library (30 μl, 30 mg/ml in PBS) was applied to a column of GST-PDZ-saturated glutathione beads (100 μl) and washed extensively with PBS. Bound peptides were eluted with 30% acetic acid (200 μl), evaporated to dryness, resuspended in water, and sequenced by automated Edman degradation. The selectivity values were determined as for the cleavage motif above. No selectivity was observed in low levels of background peptide bound to a control GST column (data not shown).Peptide Cleavage Assays—Peptide cleavage was assayed by incubating 100 nm HtrA2 with 10 μm florescent substrate at 30 °C in tobacco etch virus cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Fluorescence was monitored on a CytoFluor multi-well plate reader, Series 4000 (PerSeptive Biosystems). Reaction rates (V (arbitrary fluorescence units/min)) were determined by linear regression analysis of the data points corresponding to the maximum reaction rates for each assay condition. Assays are representative of at least three independent experiments done in triplicate. The kcat/Km value for the H2-optimal substrate was determined from the reaction rate at a substrate concentration (10 μm) where [S] << Km.Immunoprecipitation of XIAP-HtrA2 Complexes—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A. Cell lysates were incubated in the presence of either anti-HtrA2 antibodies or preimmune serum precoupled to protein A-Sepharose beads. Antigen-antibody complexes were allowed to form at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were washed three times with PBS and resuspended in tobacco etch virus cleavage buffer containing 10 μm H2-Opt fluorescent substrate for activity assays.RESULTSDetermination of the Optimal Peptide Cleavage Site Motif for HtrA2/Omi—To establish the cleavage site motif for HtrA2/Omi, we have employed a recently described methodology involving the use of degenerate peptide libraries. This approach allows for the determination of the preferred amino acid residues both amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal to the peptide bond cleaved by a given protease. We began by purifying the mature form of HtrA2/Omi from a bacterial expression system (Fig. 1A). Activity of the purified HtrA2/Omi was confirmed by zymogram analysis against casein (Fig. 1B). The only proteolytic activity of HtrA2/Omi that could be detected was toward casein, with the exception of auto-processing of the full-length form in an in vitro transcription/translation system (data not shown). We therefore decided to test the activity of the purified enzyme as an endopeptidase toward a peptide containing the sequence in HtrA2/Omi that is auto-processed (VTLC-AVPS). We were able to confirm that HtrA2/Omi can cleave the peptide Mca-VTLCAVPS(Dnp)KK (termed self-cleavage peptide) between cysteine and alanine but not a control peptide (Mca-KPNNLRM(Dnp)) (data not shown).Since cleavage of the peptide mimicking the auto-processing site was slow, we proceeded to determine the optimal motif for HtrA2/Omi by incubating the enzyme in the presence of a random peptide library mixture. The selectivities determined through this approach are shown in Fig. 1C. The main selectivity at position P1 (immediately amino-terminal to the cleaved peptide bond) is for non-polar aliphatic amino acids, in particular valine, isoleucine, and methionine. At the P2 and P3 positions, arginine is selected most strongly with a secondary selection for other hydrophilic residues. Such a repeating motif may indicate that substrates bind in distinct modes, in which a common site on the enzyme interacts with either the P2 or P3 residue. Carboxyl-terminal to the cleavage site, the strongest selectivity is at P2′ for tyrosine and phenylalanine, although clearly these residues are not absolutely required. There is also some selection for alanine and serine at P1′. The enzyme is largely unselective carboxyl-terminal to the P2′ position. Based on the information obtained from the digestion of the oriented peptide library mixture, we designed a fluorescent peptide substrate, named H2-Opt, that accommodates optimal HtrA2/Omi amino acid preferences at each position: Mca-IRRVSYSF(Dnp)KK. Mature HtrA2/Omi cleaves the H2-Opt substrate very efficiently (kcat/Km = 1250 m-1 s-1), even under conditions where activity toward the self-cleavage peptide substrate is undetectable (Fig. 1D). This value was estimated at a substrate concentration (10 μm) that was well below the Km (estimated at >100 μm).The PDZ Domain of HtrA2/Omi Regulates Its Proteolytic Activity—To address directly the role of the PDZ domain in the regulation of HtrA2/Omi activity, we first decided to determine the preferred carboxyl-terminal-binding sequence selected by the PDZ domain of HtrA2/Omi (H2-PDZ). Peptides with high affinity toward H2-PDZ fused to GST (Fig. 2A) were purified from a random mixture and sequenced. We found that peptides terminating in the hydrophobic amino acids valine, isoleucine, or alanine were highly represented in the bound peptide pool (Fig. 2B). We observed further selectivity at positions -1, -2, -3, and -5 for the aromatic side chain-containing amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. To test the ability of PDZ-interacting peptides to influence the activity of HtrA2/Omi, we preincubated the enzyme in the presence of candidate H2-PDZ-interacting peptides. The optimal HtrA2/Omi PDZ domain-binding peptide, b-GQYYFV-COOH (termed PDZ-Opt), caused a major increase in the reaction rate and loss of the initial lag for cleavage of H2-Opt substrate peptide by HtrA2/Omi. The peptide based on the carboxyl-terminal sequence generated by HtrA2/Omi auto-proteolysis, b-GGIRRV-COOH (termed PDZSub), also activated the protease, but significantly less efficiently than PDZ-Opt. Substitution of the carboxyl-terminal group with an amide residue abrogates this effect (Fig. 2, C and D), consistent with requirement for a free COOH terminus in PDZ-binding peptides (16.Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). A protein lacking the PDZ domain, HtrA2/OmiΔPDZ, showed rapid hydrolysis of H2-Opt peptide without a lag phase, confirming that the PDZ domain normally restrains the protease activity of the catalytic site (Fig. 2, C and D). None of the peptides used produced an increase in the reaction rate when incubated with HtrA2/OmiΔPDZ (data not shown). These data therefore suggest that the PDZ domain of HtrA2/Omi usually restrains the protease activity, possibly through restricting access to the catalytic site. Binding of peptides to the PDZ domain results in a conformational change that improves substrate access to the proteolytic site. Since we are unable to measure the Km due to its high value, we cannot conclude whether these effects are on the kcat or Km of the enzyme.Fig. 2Determination and characterization of peptide motifs that interact with the PDZ domain of HtrA2/Omi.A, SDS-PAGE analysis of purified GST and GST-PDZ.

Beil A. Ehrmann M. Cell. 1999; 97: 339-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). We were interested to determine whether the same is true for HtrA2/Omi, and if so, whether heat shock led to alteration of the ability of the PDZ domain to suppress the activity of the protease domain. We observed that preincubation of HtrA2/Omi at 42 °C for 30 min resulted in increased proteolytic activity toward H2-Opt (measured after return to 30 °C) and loss of the initial lag phase in substrate cleavage. We could not observe a similar effect using the enzyme lacking the PDZ domain (Fig. 3, A and C). This truncated enzyme had increased activity relative to full-length HtrA2/Omi as discussed above but was actually inhibited by heat shock, possibly reflecting some denaturation of the catalytic site.Fig. 3Effect of heat shock on the activity of HtrA2/Omi and HtrA2/OmiΔPDZ.A and C, effect of heat shock (HS) on the kinetics of H2-Opt cleavage by HtrA2/Omi and HtrA2/OmiΔPDZ.

Our results show that the presence of PDZ-Opt peptide is incapable of promoting further activation of heat-shocked HtrA2/Omi (Fig. 3, B and D). The addition of PDZ-Opt, resulting in peptide engagement of the PDZ domain, caused the same degree of activation of HtrA2/Omi protease activity as did heat shock. It is possible that the two treatments have a similar effect on the structure of HtrA2/Omi, resulting in displacement of the PDZ domain from the active site. On the other hand, it is also a possibility that the heat-treated enzyme may no longer be able to bind PDZ-Opt peptide. Heat shock could conceivably lead to selective unfolding of the PDZ domain, resulting in it being unable either to bind PDZ-Opt peptides or to interfere with the catalytic site.Interaction with XIAP Activates HtrA2/Omi Protease—Upon translocation to the cytosol following mitochondrial damage due to apoptotic stress, HtrA2/Omi binds to BIR domains of IAPs through its amino-terminal Reaper-like motif. Previous reports indicated that IAPs had little or no effect on the activity of HtrA2/Omi toward the substrate β-casein (5.Verhagen A.M. Silke J. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Kaufmann H. Connolly L.M.

Nakayama H. Takahashi K. Takio K. Takahashi R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 613-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Since bovine β-casein has a carboxyl-terminal sequence similar to a putative PDZ-interacting peptide (FPIIV, which fits the PDZ-binding consensus better than IRRV), we hypothesized that this carboxyl-terminal sequence could lead to HtrA2/Omi activation masking any effect of other activators. We therefore decided to address the effect of XIAP on the cleavage of H2-Opt peptide by HtrA2/Omi. We observed a dramatic increase in the proteolytic reaction rate when XIAP was incubated with HtrA2/Omi (Fig. 4, A and C). Preincubation of XIAP with either Smac or peptides mimicking the amino-terminal Reaper-like motif of processed HtrA2/Omi reversed the effect of XIAP on HtrA2/Omi. As a control, a peptide with a substitution in the amino-terminal alanine critical for interaction with XIAP (6.Martins L.M. Iaccarino I. Tenev T. Gschmeissner S. Totty N.F. Lemoine N.R.

This indicates that interaction of XIAP with the amino-terminal Reaper motif of HtrA2/Omi results in the activation of the proteolytic activity of the enzyme.Fig. 4Effect of XIAP on the activity of HtrA2/Omi.A and C, effect of XIAP and XIAP-interacting molecules on the kinetics of H2-Opt cleavage by HtrA2/Omi.

Here, we reconstruct a millennium of metallurgical activity in southern Bolivia using the stratigraphy of metals associated with smelting (Pb, Sb, Bi, Ag, Sn) from lake sediments deposited near the major silver deposit of Cerro Rico de Potosí. Pronounced metal enrichment events coincide with the terminal stages of Tiwanaku culture (1000 to 1200 A.D.) and Inca through early Colonial times (1400 to 1650 A.D.). The earliest of these events suggests that Cerro Rico ores were actively smelted at a large scale in the Late Intermediate Period, providing evidence for a major pre-Incan silver industry."
https://openalex.org/W2147469677,"P450 RhF from Rhodococcus sp. NCIMB 9784 is the first example of a new class of cytochrome P450 in which electrons are supplied by a novel, FMN- and Fe/S-containing, reductase partner in a fused arrangement. We have previously cloned the gene encoding the enzyme and shown it to comprise an N-terminal P450 domain fused to a reductase domain that displays similarity to the phthalate family of oxygenase reductase proteins. A reductase of this type had never previously been reported to interact with a cytochrome P450. In this report we describe the purification and partial characterization of P450 RhF. We show that the enzyme is self-sufficient in catalyzing the O-dealkylation of 7-ethoxycoumarin. The P450 RhF catalyzed O-dealkylation of 7-ethoxycoumarin is inhibited by several compounds that are known inhibitors of cytochrome P450. Presteady state kinetic analysis indicates that P450 RhF shows a 500-fold preference for NAPDH over NADH in terms of Kd value (6.6 μmversus 3.7 mm, respectively). Potentiometric studies show reduction potentials of –243 mV for the two-electron reduction of the FMN and –423 mV for the heme (in the absence of substrate). P450 RhF from Rhodococcus sp.

Cytochrome P450 is a superfamily of monooxygenase enzymes with diverse catalytic activities. These have been found in all three phylogenetic domains of life, including many higher animal tissues. The primary chemical reaction catalyzed by these monooxygenases is the two-electron activation of molecular dioxygen, whereby one oxygen atom is inserted into the substrate with concomitant reduction of the second atom to water. NAD(P)H provides the required electron equivalents via a number of different redox partners (1.Nerbert D.W. Gonzalez F.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 945-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). Depending on the nature of the redox partner, P450 enzymes generally fall into two broad classes. Class I enzymes are three-component systems comprising an NAD(P)H-binding flavoprotein reductase, a small iron-sulfur protein, and the P450. These enzymes are found in the mitochondrial membranes of eukaryotes and in most bacteria. Class II enzymes are two-component systems comprising an FAD- and FMN-containing NADPH reductase (in which FAD and FMN are in an equimolar ratio) and the P450. This type of P450 is found almost exclusively in eukaryotes in association with the endoplasmic reticulum, where they play a major role in the oxidative metabolism of a wide spectrum of substrates including xenobiotics, endogenous fatty acids, steroids, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and vitamins. There are, however, examples of cytochrome P450 that cannot readily be defined as a member of either of these two classes. P450 BM3 (CYP102A1) from Bacillus megaterium, which oxidizes long chain fatty acids, comprises a diflavin reductase fused to the P450 to form a catalytically self-sufficient single polypeptide enzyme (2.Narhi L.O. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7160-7169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasermann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). P450 BM3 has been likened to a fused eukaryotic class II enzyme. However, since its primary structural organization is quite distinct from the class II enzymes, P450 BM3 is regarded as the first example of a new, self-sufficient, class of P450 enzyme. Two further examples of P450 enzymes of this type (CYP102A2 and CYP102A3) from Bacillus subtilis were identified as a result of a whole genome sequencing project (4.Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. Albertini A.M. Alloni G. Azevedo V. Bertero M.G. Bessieres P. Bolotin A. Borchert S. Borriss R. Boursier L. Brans A. Braun M. Brignell S.C. Bron S. Brouillet S. Bruschi C.V. Caldwell B. Capuano V.

Haga K. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3127) Google Scholar). A BM3-like P450 from the actinomycete Actinosynnema pretiosum, which is thought to be involved in the biosynthesis of the polyketide antitumor agent ansamitocin, has also been described (5.Yu T.-W. Bai L. Clade D. Hoffmann D. Toelzer S. Trinh K.Q. Xu J. Moss S.J. Leistner E. Floss H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7968-7973Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Two membrane-bound eukaryotic counterparts of P450 BM3 have been cloned from Fusarium oxysporum (6.Kitazume T. Takaya N. Nakayama N. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39734-39740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and Fusarium verticillioides (7.Seo J.-A. Proctor R.H. Plattner R.D. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2001; 34: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Recently, a search against a data base of unfinished genome sequencing projects identified three more examples from Bacillus anthracis (Ames strain), Bacillus cereus, and the β-proteobacterium Ralstonia metallidurans (8.De Mot R. Parret A.H.A. Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). During a PCR-based screen for new P450 activities from actinomycetes, we cloned a novel P450 gene from Rhodococcus sp. NCIMB 9784 (previously classified as Corynebacterium sp. Strain T1), which was of unique primary structural organization (9.Roberts G.A. Grogan G. Greter A. Flitsch S.L. Turner N.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3898-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, an analysis of the gene revealed that it encoded a heme domain fused to a reductase displaying convincing similarity to the phthalate family of dioxygenase reductases. We named the enzyme P450 RhF to reflect both its origin and the fused nature of the gene product. Despite the fact that proteins homologous to the C-terminal reductase portion of P450 RhF have been found in a diverse range of organisms, this was the first time an oxidoreductase of this type had been implicated in partnering a P450 enzyme. The N-terminal heme portion of the enzyme displays striking similarity to the thiocarbamate-inducible P450 from Rhodococcus erythropolis NI86/21 (ThcB), a class I enzyme of the CYP116 family (10.Nagy I. Schoofs G. Compernolle F. Proost P. Vanderleyden J. De Mot R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 676-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Working independently, De Mot and Parret (8.De Mot R. Parret A.H.A. Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) identified four putative homologues to P450 RhF from three pathogenic Burkholderia species and the heavy metal-resistant bacterium R. metallidurans by analyzing unfinished genomes with the ThcB sequence. We have previously shown that a recombinant strain of Escherichia coli expressing the gene for P450 RhF was able to dealkylate 7-ethoxycoumarin, whereas the same strain lacking this gene was unable to do so. However, in these whole cell studies we could not definitively demonstrate that the enzyme was catalytically self-sufficient due to the possible involvement of endogenous electron transfer proteins. In this report we describe the isolation and partial characterization of recombinant P450 RhF. Enzymes and Chemicals—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Biotinylated thrombin was supplied by Novagen (Madison, WI). A protease inhibitor mixture containing 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, bestatin, pepstatin A, trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanido)butane, and N-(α-rhamnopyranosyloxyhydroxyphosphinyl)-Leu-Trp-(phosphoramidon) was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, Vent DNA polymerase, and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Maintenance and Growth of Microorganisms—Rhodococcus sp. NCIMB 9784 was obtained from the National Culture of Industrial and Marine Bacteria (Aberdeen, UK). The strain was maintained on nutrient agar slopes at room temperature, and grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (11.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) at 30 °C in baffled flasks. E. coli XL2-Blue MRF' ultra-competent cells were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and grown in LB medium at 37 °C. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were obtained from Invitrogen (Groningen, The Netherlands) and grown at 30 °C in LB medium unless stated otherwise. Ampicillin was used at 100 μg/ml when required for selection of plasmid on both liquid and solid medium. pET14b used in the expression studies was obtained from Novagen. DNA Manipulations—Standard DNA procedures were used throughout (11.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total DNA was prepared from Rhodococcus sp. NCIMB 9784 as described previously (12.Grogan G. Roberts G.A. Bougioukou D. Turner N.J. Flitsch S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12565-12572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The full-length gene encoding P450 RhF was cloned into pET14b for expression to give a fusion protein with a 20-residue N-terminal prepeptide, which includes a His6 tag and a thrombin cleavage site. The P450 RhF gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into the expression vector. The forward and reverse primers for the amplification were 5′-CGGTGTCCATATGAGTGCATCAGTTCCGGCG-3′ and 5′-AGGTTGATCATTCAGAGTCGCAGGGCCAGCC-3′, respectively. The NdeI and BclI restriction endonuclease sites used for the subsequent cloning of the PCR product are underlined. The PCR consisted of 30 cycles, with denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 45 s and extension for 2 min 30 s at 72 °C. The initial denaturation step was at 95 °C for 2 min. The PCR mix included Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, MS), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0 at room temperature), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 40 pm of each primer, 10% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, and ∼50 ng of Rhodococcus sp. NCIMB 9784 total genomic DNA as template in a reaction volume of 50 μl. The PCR product was isolated and digested with NdeI and BclI restriction endonucleases. The digested DNA was purified and cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET14b vector to give the final expression construct (pAG04). Plasmid construction was performed in E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′. The insert DNA was sequenced to ensure no mistakes had been introduced during the amplification process. pAG04 was then transformed into the expression strain E. coli BL21(DE3). Production of His6-P450 RhF—E. coli BL21(DE3) containing the expression construct was grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 30 °C. We had previously demonstrated that a non-tagged version of P450 RhF was synthesized in a largely insoluble form when the culture temperature was elevated to 37 °C (9.Roberts G.A. Grogan G. Greter A. Flitsch S.L. Turner N.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3898-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). After induction with 1 mmIPTG 1The abbreviations used are: IPTGisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranosideMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightOTTLEoptically transparent thin layer electrochemical. at an optical density (OD600) of 0.8, growth was continued for up to 4 h before harvesting. Aliquots were withdrawn at regular time points. Expression was assessed by comparing the banding pattern obtained by SDS-PAGE analysis of whole cell extracts with that of a negative control (i.e. E. coli BL21(DE3)pET14b). The solubility of the protein was assessed by a standard procedure (11.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight optically transparent thin layer electrochemical. Although expression was found to be constitutive, we followed the standard induction protocol using IPTG for protein purification studies. Typically a starter culture (100 ml of LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin) was grown to an optical density of ∼0.8–1.0 from a single colony (∼16 h growth at 30 °C) using a baffled shake flask. This was then used to inoculate 10 liters of LB medium (containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin) in a fermentor (Bioflo 4500, New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ). When the OD600 reached 0.4 (after ∼4 h growth) expression of the recombinant gene was induced by adding 1 mm IPTG. Cells were harvested 3 h after IPTG induction and stored at –20 °C. Typically, using this protocol, we obtained about 20–25 g of cell paste from 10 liters of broth. Protein Purification—Approximately 20 g of cell paste was suspended in 20 ml of ice-cold buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 200 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were disrupted by sonication using a Soniprep 150 sonicator (Sanyo, Tokyo, Japan) fitted with a 9-mm diameter probe. The cell suspension was split into two equal volumes for disruption and each aliquot was kept on ice and sonicated with a 15 s burst followed by a 45 s interval. This process was repeated 12 times. The resulting cell extract was centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The cell-free extract was carefully removed and filtered through a 0.45-micron filter unit. The clarified extract was then loaded onto a 5-ml Nickel HiTrap column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated in buffer A at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Column chromatography was performed at 4 °C. The column was then extensively washed with buffer A (12 column volumes) to remove unbound material. The majority of contaminating proteins were then removed by washing with 30 mm imidazole in buffer A (10 column volumes) before elution of the recombinant His-tagged P450RhF by 300 mm imidazole in buffer A. The buffer was exchanged using a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) which was equilibrated in Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) at 4 °C. The small amount of contaminating protein was removed by anion exchange chromatography. The protein sample (∼7.0 ml) was loaded onto a Resource-Q column (6 ml) (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. The column was then washed with two column volumes of Buffer B. Protein was eluted using a linear gradient of 0–1.0 m NaCl in buffer B over 20 column volumes. P450 RhF was eluted in ∼250 mm NaCl. The sample volume (∼4 ml) was reduced to 1 ml using a spin concentrator with a 30 kDa cut-off membrane (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany). Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 50% (v/v) and the sample stored at –20 °C. Removal of the N-terminal His Tag—The N-terminal His tag was removed using biotinylated thrombin. Typically, 1.0 unit of thrombin was incubated with 200 μg of P450 RhF at 22 °C for 90 min. Biotinylated thrombin was subsequently removed using streptavidin agarose. Protein was then recovered by spin-filtration. The extent of cleavage was determined by both Western blot analysis using an anti-His tag antibody and by mass spectrometry. Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometry of the intact recombinant P450 RhF was performed by MALDI-TOF using a Voyager DE STR instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Protein samples were diluted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to ∼0.05 mg/ml and mixed with an equal volume of matrix (saturated solution of sinapinic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacteic acid) on a stainless steel surface. The samples were air dried at room temperature to crystallize. The machine was operated in positive ion mode and calibrated with conalbumin and bovine serum albumin. Western Blotting—Protein samples were resolved on 10–20% SDS-PAGE gels and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences) using a Bio-Rad transblot cell at a constant current of 150 mA for 90 min. After blocking in 5% (w/v) dried milk powder the blot was subjected to immunodetection using mouse monoclonal anti-polyhistidine antibody peroxidase conjugate (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted 1:1000. Following extensive washing the blot was developed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine in urea/hydrogen peroxide (FAST DAB tablets, Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturers' guidelines. Spectroscopic Analysis—The homogeneity of the protein preparation was assessed by SDS-PAGE using a 10–20% gradient gel. The spectral properties (ratio of P450-specific absorption at 420 nm compared with protein-specific absorption at 280 nm) were also measured. The cytochrome P450 concentration was determined by the method described in the literature (13.Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using an extinction coefficient of ϵ450–490 = 91 mm–1 cm–1. Absorption spectra of P450 RhF in the UV-visible region were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-2101PC scanning spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Duisburg, Germany) using a 1-cm pathlength quartz cell. Spectra were recorded using ∼0.1–0.2 μm P450 RhF in phosphate buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol). Spectra of the reduced enzyme were recorded after the addition of a few grains of sodium dithionite. Reduced enzyme was reacted with CO by gently bubbling CO gas into a solution of reduced P450 RhF. Presteady State Kinetics—Presteady state measurements on the reduction of P450 RhF by either NADPH or NADH were performed at 25 °C using an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow spectrophotometer (SX.17MV) contained within an anaerobic glove box (Belle Technology, Portesham, UK; [O2] < 5 ppm) using either single-wavelength or diodearray detectors. Enzyme and nucleotide solutions were made up in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol. Concentrations were checked spectrophotometrically before use. FMN reductions were recorded at 462 nm, and the resultant traces analyzed using Origin 7 software (Microcal, Northampton, MA). Steady State Kinetics—The P450 RhF catalyzed formation of 7-hydroxycoumarin from 7-ethoxycoumarin was monitored directly by fluorescence spectrophotometry in a 96-well plate format. A microtiter plate reader (SPECTRAmax GEMINIXS, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was set up as follows: excitation wavelength, 397 nm; emission wavelength, 466 nm; cut off wavelength, 420 nm; temperature, 30 °C. Under these conditions, there was no interference from the substrate 7-ethoxycoumarin. A series of eight solutions of 7-ethoxycoumarin (0–2 mm) were prepared by successive dilutions of a stock solution of 10 mm 7-ethoxycoumarin in Me2SO into 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8. The maximum final concentration of Me2SO was 10% (v/v) Me2SO. From this series, 185 μl was transferred into wells of the 96-well plate. 5 μl of P450 RhF from a 3.4 μm stock solution was added (0.086 μm) into each well and equilibrated for 3 min at room temperature. The reaction was initiated by addition of 10 μl of NAD(P)H solution from a freshly prepared stock (10 mm) using an 8-channel pipette. The plate was then immediately placed into the plate reader. The plate was shaken for 5 s to ensure thorough mixing, and then time-based measurements were recorded every 15 s for 10 min. The rate of formation of 7-hydroxycoumarin was calculated using an extinctionemission coefficient of ϵ = 1502 mm–1, which was determined using 7-hydroxycoumarin standards. For the inhibition studies, each inhibitor (either 5 or 10 mm) was pre-incubated with the assay mix (minus cofactor) for 5 min prior to initiating the reaction with NADPH. A negative control was also included in which no inhibitor was added. Steady state consumption of NADPH or NADH by P450 RhF could be measured using K3[Fe(CN)6] as an artificial electron acceptor. In a typical reaction, 1 mm (a saturating concentration) of K3[Fe(CN)6] in phosphate buffer was incubated with 5–6 nm of P450 RhF for 3 min and the reaction was initiated by addition of either NADH or NADPH at different concentrations (0–60 μm). The reaction was monitored at 340 nm (30 °C) for 10 min using a microtiter plate reader (VERSAmax, Molecular Devices). Optically Transparent Thin Layer Electrochemical (OTTLE) Potentiometry—Spectroelectrochemical analysis of P450 RhF was conducted in an OTTLE cell constructed from a modified quartz EPR cell with a 0.3-mm path length, containing a Pt/Rh (95/5) gauze working electrode (wire diameter 0.06 mm, mesh size 1024 cm–1), a platinum wire counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode (model MF2052; Bioanalytical Systems, West Lafayette, IN). Enzyme samples (0.5 ml × 100–200 μm) were eluted through a G25 column pre-equilibrated with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m KCl in an anaerobic glove box. The following mediators: pyocyanine (10 μm), 2-hydroxy-1,4-napthoquinone (20 μm), FMN (5 μm), benzyl viologen (10 μm), and methyl viologen (10 μm) were then added. Spectroelectrochemical titrations were performed at 25 ± 2 °C using an Autolab PGSTAT10 potentiostat and a Cary 50 UV/vis spectrophotometer. The potential of the working electrode was decreased in 30 mV steps until the enzyme was fully reduced and increased stepwise until reoxidation was complete. After each step the current and UV/vis absorption spectrum were monitored until no further change occurred. This equilibration process typically lasted 15 min. Absorbance changes at 418 nm (heme) and 462 nm (FMN) were plotted against the potential of the working electrode and analyzed simultaneously using the Nernst equation. The Ag/AgCl reference electrode employed in the OTTLE cell was calibrated against indigotrisulfonic acid (Em = –99 mV versus SHE) and FMN (Em = –220 mV versus SHE) in the same buffer conditions. All electrode potentials were corrected accordingly by +205 ± 2 mV relative to the standard hydrogen electrode. Recombinant Expression—The expression construct (pAG04) was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3), and the resultant cell extracts analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A band corresponding to the predicted molecular mass of the recombinant protein was visible on Coomassie-stained gels of the expression strain, which was absent from the control strain (E. coli BL21(DE3)pET14b). The identity of this band was confirmed by Western blot analysis using an anti-His tag antibody. Although we observed significant levels of recombinant protein from cell extracts of the expression strain grown in the absence of IPTG (i.e. leaky expression), protein purified from these preparations was generally subject to substantial proteolytic degradation. Subsequent analysis of whole cell extracts by Western blotting confirmed that much of this proteolysis was occurring in the cell prior to disruption (data not shown). In order to minimize this problem, all subsequent protein preparations were derived from cells grown in a fermentor to a low cell density (OD ∼0.4), induced with IPTG, and then harvested shortly afterward (See “Experimental Procedures”). The level of recombinant P450 RhF peaked at about 3 h after induction (Fig. 1). His6-P450 RhF was purified using metal ion affinity and anion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 2). The His tag was then efficiently removed by treatment with thrombin. Removal of the tag was confirmed by both Western blot analysis using an anti-His tag antibody and by mass spectrometry (Fig. 3). We could detect no evidence of adventitious proteolysis at sites outside the targeted scissile bond.Fig. 3Analysis of thrombin-treated His6-P450 RhF.Panel A, MALDI-TOF analysis of protein before (bottom) and after (top) treatment with thrombin.

Recombinant His6-P450 RhF and recombinant P450 RhF lacking the His tag gave essentially identical UV-visible absorption spectra that are typical of P450 hemoproteins (14.Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450, Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 305-364Crossref Google Scholar). The oxidized form of purified P450 RhF displays the general spectral properties of cytochrome P450 enzymes with the major Soret band located at 424 nm, and the smaller α and β peaks at 574 and 539 nm, respectively (Fig. 4). Upon reduction with sodium dithionite, the Soret band shifts to 423 nm and diminishes in intensity. Subsequent bubbling of CO through the solution of dithionite-treated P450 RhF resulted in the characteristic shift of the Soret band to 450 nm. The CO-difference spectrum displays the prominent peak at 450 nm (Fig. 4, inset). The spectral characteristics of the enzyme remained unchanged after 3 months storage at –20 °C in 50% (v/v) glycerol. P450 RhF with and without the His tag display the same spectral properties, suggesting that the presence of these additional residues at the N terminus does not perturb the heme environment. Interestingly when the His tag was engineered onto the C terminus of P450 RhF the purified enzyme displayed the same spectral characteristics but was enzymatically inactive (data not shown). In this case the His tag may have perturbed the [2Fe-2S] cluster, thereby interfering with the electron transfer process. Nucleotide Preference of P450 RhF—In order to determine the pyridine-nucleotide preference of P450 RhF, both pre-steady state and steady state experiments were performed. The direct reduction of the FMN group was monitored using stopped-flow spectrophotometry and the resulting plots of kobsversus nucleotide concentration can be seen in Fig. 5. These gave rise to values for NADPH of Kd = 6.6 ± 0.8 μm and klim = 180 ± 5 s–1 with the corresponding values for NADH being Kd = 3.7 ± 0.3 mm and klim 111 ± 5 s–1. The P450 RhF catalyzed steady state oxidation of NAD(P)H using ferricyanide as an artificial electron acceptor also showed this cofactor preference. The NADPH-dependent reduction of potassium ferricyanide gave a kcat of 39 ± 1 s–1 and a Km of 6.6 ± 0.4 μm whereas NADH gave a kcat of 16 ± 2 s–1 and a Km of 0.18 ± 0.04 mm. These results make it clear that P450 RhF has a large preference for NADPH rather than NADH. Kinetics of 7-Ethoxycoumarin Dealkylation—P450 RhF catalyzes the O-dealkylation of 7-ethoxycoumarin to form 7-hydroxycoumarin. The kinetic results obtained for His6-P450 RhF were essentially the same as for the recombinant protein in which the His tag had been removed. The steady state kinetics of the O-dealkylation of 7-ethoxycoumarin obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics and a typical plot of rate versus substrate concentration is shown in Fig. 6. Steady state parameters, kcat and Km were 4.9 ± 0.1 min–1 and 0.22 ± 0.01 mm, respectively. The fluorescent properties of 7-hydroxycoumarin, which differ from 7-ethoxycoumarin, allowed us to accurately and directly determine a low level of substrate turnover without the need for indirect measurement of NADPH consumption. The latter method is usually problematic due to both self-oxidation and the low level of coupling efficiency often associated with unnatural compounds acting as substrates. Nevertheless we also analyzed the rate of depletion of NADPH by monitoring the absorbance at 340 nm (data not shown). By comparing these results with those obtained from the direct measurement of product formation we estimate the coupling efficiency is between 10–15%. P450 RhF activity against 7-ethoxycoumarin is inhibited by a number of general P450 inhibitors. The Ki values for three of these compounds were determined: 4-phenylimidazole, 0.8 ± 0.1 mm; 1-phenylimidazole, 1.6 ± 0.1 mm; and metyrapone,"
https://openalex.org/W2083199176,"EB1 family proteins are evolutionarily conserved proteins that bind microtubule plus-ends and centrosomes and regulate the dynamics and organization of microtubules. Human EB1 family proteins, which include EB1, EBF3, and RP1, also associate with the tumor suppressor protein adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and p150glued, a component of the dynactin complex. The structural basis for interaction between human EB1 family proteins and their associated proteins has not been defined in detail. EB1 family proteins have a calponin homology (CH) domain at their N terminus and an EB1-like C-terminal motif at their C terminus; the functional importance of these domains has not been determined. To better understand functions of human EB1 family proteins and to reveal functional similarities and differences among these proteins, we performed detailed characterizations of interactions between human EB1 family proteins and their associated proteins. We show that amino acids 1–133 of EB1 and EBF3 and the corresponding region of RP1, which contain a CH domain, are necessary and sufficient for binding microtubules, thus demonstrating for the first time that a CH domain contributes to binding microtubules. EB1 family proteins use overlapping but different regions that contain the EB1-like C-terminal motif to associate with APC and p150glued. Neither APC nor p150glued binding domain is necessary for EB1 or EBF3 to induce microtubule bundling, which requires amino acids 1–181 and 1–185 of EB1 and EBF3, respectively. We also determined that the EB1 family protein-binding regions are amino acids 2781–2820 and 18–111 of APC and p150glued, respectively.

Microtubules are important for many cellular functions, such as intracellular transportation, maintenance of cell shape and cell polarity, and chromosome segregation. Appropriate functioning of microtubules requires appropriate regulation of their dynamics. Although microtubules are intrinsically dynamic, their dynamics can be regulated by many proteins in vitro and in vivo (1.Andersen S.S.

In most cells, the minus-ends of microtubules are anchored at the centrosome, whereas plus-ends are more dynamic and are responsible for searching and contacting targets such as cell cortex and chromosomes. Proteins that bind plus-ends of microtubules may have important roles in regulating dynamics and functions of microtubules (4.Schuyler S.C. Pellman D.

In mammalian cells, overexpression of EB1 and EBF3 has been shown to induce bundling of microtubules (24.Bu W. Su L.-K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).All EB1 family proteins have a highly conserved N-terminal region that contains a CH domain (Conserved Domain Database pfam00307) and an EB1-like C-terminal motif (Conserved Domain Database pfam03271), which is unique to EB1 family proteins (Fig. 1). The CH domain has been shown to be important for binding actin in some proteins, but its function in many other proteins is not clear (30.Gimona M. Djinovic-Carugo K. Kranewitter W.J. Winder S.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The EB1-like C-terminal motif (amino acids 209–254 of EB1) is partially overlapped with a proposed leucine zipper motif (amino acids 196–224 of EB1) (23.Juwana J.P. Henderikx P. Mischo A. Wadle A. Fadle N. Gerlach K. Arends J.W. Hoogenboom H. Pfreundschuh M. Renner C. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which is also called coiled-coil region (amino acids 191–226 of EB1) (9.Rehberg M. Graf R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2301-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).Despite the important functions of the EB1 family proteins, the structural basis for many of these functions is still not clear. Although EB1 family proteins associate with microtubules and can induce microtubule bundling, they do not contain any previously characterized microtubule-binding domains. Although there have been some characterizations of the interactions of EB1 with APC and with p150glued, these interactions have not been well defined (15.Askham J.M. Vaughan K.T. Goodson H.V. Morrison E.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3627-3645Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 23.Juwana J.P. Henderikx P. Mischo A. Wadle A. Fadle N. Gerlach K. Arends J.W. Hoogenboom H. Pfreundschuh M. Renner C. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Moreover, all three human EB1 family proteins express ubiquitously, but most studies so far have focused on EB1. To better understand functions of human EB1 family proteins and to reveal potential similar and different functions of these proteins, we performed detailed characterization of interactions between human EB1 family proteins and their associated proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines, Transfection, and Nocodazole Treatment—Human colon cancer cell lines HCT116 and DLD-1 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were grown in McCoy's 5A medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose), respectively, containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To depolymerize microtubules, cells were treated with 10 μm nocodazole at 37 °C for 1 h, as previously described (24.Bu W. Su L.-K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Plasmids—Plasmids containing cDNAs encoding full-length EB1 family proteins and APC have been described (11.Su L.-K. Qi Y.

Most cDNA fragments for EB1 family proteins or APC were generated by PCR using plasmids containing the corresponding full-length cDNA as the template. The cDNA fragment of p150d1 was generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR using total RNA from HCT116 cells. The p150d2 cDNA fragment was generated by PCR using plasmids containing p150d1 as the template. The cDNA fragments generated by PCR and sequences of primers used in PCR are summarized in Table I. PCR products were first cloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. PCR fragments that had correct sequences were then transferred, with the correct reading frame, into an appropriate plasmid of the pEGFP-C vector set (Clontech) for expressing EGFP-tagged proteins in mammalian cells or into pGSTag (32.Ron D. Dressler H. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 866-869PubMed Google Scholar) for expressing GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli.

Different EGFP-tagged fragments of EB1 family proteins were expressed in HCT116 cells by transient transfection. Lysates were prepared from cells the day after transfection and incubated with purified GST-tagged APC or p150glued fragments immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). Purified protein complexes were then resolved by SDS-PAGE, and EGFP-tagged proteins were detected by immunoblotting using an anti-EGFP antibody.Some fragments of EB1 were also expressed as GST-tagged proteins in E. coli, affinity-purified, and used to bind wild-type APC from HCT116 cell lysate as previously described (11.Su L.-K.

Open table in a new tab Determination of Fractions of Cells without Microtubule Plus-end-localized p150glued or EBF3—To quantify the fraction of cells without microtubule plus-end localized p150glued and EBF3 caused by the expression of EGFP-tagged EB1 fragments, cells transfected side-by-side with the same plasmid expressing an EGFP-tagged EB1 fragment were stained with primary antibodies against either EBF3 or p150glued and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies. The localization of EBF3 or p150glued in more than 50 randomly selected green cells, indicative of expression of EGFP-tagged EB1 fragments, was examined. The percentage of cells without microtubule plus-end-localized of p150glued or EBF3 among transfected cells was then calculated. Two independent transfections of each EB1 fragment were performed.RESULTSMicrotubule-binding Domain of EB1 Family Proteins—We mapped the microtubule-binding domain of EB1 family proteins by examining the distribution pattern of EGFP-tagged fragments of EB1 family proteins in transiently transfected cells. Similar approaches have previously been used to identify the microtubule-binding domain of other MAPs (34.Pierre P. Pepperkok R. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Sun D. Leung C.L. Liem R.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 161-172PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Hoogenraad C.C. Akhmanova A. Grosveld F. De Zeeuw C.I. Galjart N. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2285-2297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our initial characterizations showed that only the N-terminal conserved region-containing part of EB1 family proteins associated with microtubules in vivo, whereas the EB1-like C-terminal motif-containing part did not (Fig. 1). Examination of additional N-terminal fragments of EB1 family proteins showed that EGFP-tagged proteins containing amino acids 1–133 of EB1 and EBF3 and the corresponding region of RP1 (amino acids 44–176) colocalized with microtubules. Furthermore, the filamentous distribution pattern of these EGFP-tagged EB1 family protein fragments disappeared along with microtubules in cells treated with nocodazole (Fig. 1). Deletions from either the N terminus (EB1d4, EBF3d4, and RP1d4) or C terminus (EB1d5 and EBF3d5) of this 133-amino acid fragment abolished its microtubule-binding ability (Fig. 1). These results demonstrated that the N-terminal 133 amino acids of EB1 and EBF3 and the corresponding region of RP1 are sufficient and necessary for association with microtubules.Microtubule-bundling Domain of EB1 Family Proteins—We then characterized the microtubule-bundling domain of EB1 and EBF3. We had previously shown that overexpression of EB1 and EBF3 induced microtubule bundling in many mammalian cell lines (24.Bu W. Su L.-K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Many MAPs have been shown to induce microtubule bundling when overexpressed, and their microtubule-binding domains are necessary but not sufficient for their microtubule-bundling activity (36.Hoogenraad C.C. Akhmanova A. Grosveld F. De Zeeuw C.I. Galjart N. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2285-2297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Lewis S.A. Ivanov I.E. Lee G.H. Cowan N.J.

To identify the microtubule-bundling domain of EB1 family proteins, we expressed fragments of EB1 family proteins in HCT116 cells and then examined the microtubule structure of transfected cells by immunostaining α-tubulin. Deletion of amino acids 3–17 from EBF3 (EBF3d6) (Fig. 2) abolished the ability of EBF3 to associate with microtubules and to induce microtubule bundling (data not shown). On the other hand, amino acids 1–145 of EBF3 (EBF3d2) clearly associated with microtubules but could not cause microtubules to bundle (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Thus, the microtubule-binding domain was required but not sufficient for EBF3 to induce microtubule bundling. We then examined the ability of additional N-terminal fragments of EBF3 to induce microtubule bundling and found that the EBF3 fragment containing amino acids 1–185 (EBF3d8) was able to induce microtubule bundling, whereas the EBF3 fragment containing amino acids 1–165 (EBF3d7) could not (Fig. 2). An EB1 fragment containing amino acids 1–181 (EB1d7) also was able to induce microtubule bundling (Fig. 2). These results show that the putative coiled-coil region is not required for the microtubule-bundling activity of EB1 and EBF3. Similar to full-length EBF3 and EB1, EBF3d8 and EB1d7 induced microtubule bundling efficiently in DLD-1 cells, which expressed only truncated APC (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Identification of the microtubule-bundling domain of EB1 family proteins.A, schematic summary of the mapping of the microtubule-bundling domain of EB1 family proteins.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To determine the region of RP1 that caused it to behave differently from EB1 and EBF3, we examined the ability of two fusion proteins between EBF3 and RP1 (Fig. 2A) to induce microtubule bundling. Overexpression of the EBF3/RP1 fusion protein caused microtubules to bundle, and the EBF3/RP1 protein associated with microtubule bundles (Fig. 2C). In contrast, overexpression of the RP1/EBF3 fusion protein did not induce microtubule bundling, although it associated with microtubule"

In order to elucidate the mechanism of motility disorders frequently observed in IBD, we investigated the long term effects of IL-1β on rat ileal smooth muscle contractility by using an organ culture system. When ileal smooth muscle strips were cultured with IL-1β (10 ng/ml), contractions elicited by high K+ and carbachol were inhibited in a time-dependent manner. IL-1β more strongly inhibited the carbachol-induced contractions than high K+ with decreasing myosin light chain phosphorylation. In the α-toxin-permeabilized ileal muscle, carbachol with GTP or guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate increased the Ca2+ sensitivity of contractile elements, and this G protein-coupled Ca2+ sensitization was significantly reduced in the IL-1β-treated ileum. Among the functional proteins involved in the smooth muscle Ca2+ sensitization, CPI-17 expression was significantly reduced after the culture with IL-1β, whereas the expressions of RhoA, ROCK-I, ROCK-II, MYPT-1, myosin light chain kinase, and myosin phosphatase (PP1) were unchanged. The phosphorylation level of CPI-17 by carbachol was low in accordance with the decrease in CPI-17 expression due to IL-1β treatment. In contrast, constitutively phosphorylated MYPT-1 was also decreased in the IL-1β-treated muscles. These results suggest that long term treatment with IL-1β decreases either CPI-17 expression or MYPT-1 phosphorylation, which may result in an increase in myosin phosphatase activity to reduce force generation. Based on these findings, we consider IL-1β to be an important mediator of gastrointestinal motility disorders in IBD, and CPI-17 and MYPT-1 are key molecules in the decreased smooth muscle contractility due to IL-1β.

It is produced by various cell types, including monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. The biological actions of IL-1β are regulated at a transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. Expression of IL-1β is regulated by activation of mitogen-activating protein kinase and transcriptional repressors. In addition, as post-transcriptional regulation, IL-1 receptor antagonist, which is produced by the same cells as IL-1β itself, competitively counteracts the actions of IL-1β (1.Dinarello C.A.

Motility disorders of the gastrointestinal tract are extremely important clinically because they can lead to systemic disease. Intestinal inflammation results in a disturbance of motility in human and in animal models, which may reflect an alternation in the function of smooth muscle and/or the enteric nervous system (2.Vermillion D.L. Huizinga J.D. Riddell R.H. Collins S.M. Gastroenterology. 1993; 104: 1692-1699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Elevated IL-1β levels are frequently seen in both mucosa and the muscle layer during acute and chronic intestinal inflammation, including inflammatory lesions of patients with forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (3.Rogler G. Andus T. World J. Surg. 1998; 22: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 4.Vrees M.D. Pricolo V.E. Potenti F.M. Cao W. Arch. Surg. 2002; 137: 436-445Crossref Google Scholar). As for the IL-1β-producing cells in the intestinal smooth muscle layer during chronic intestinal inflammation, it is attractive to consider resident macrophages, which are regularly distributed with a network structure in the subserosa, at the level of the myenteric plexus, and inside the muscle layer (5.Mikkelsen H.B. Thuneberg L. Rumessen J.J. Thorball N. Anat. Rec. 1985; 213: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 6.Hori M. Kita M. Torihashi S. Miyamoto S. Won K.J. Sato K. Ozaki H. Karaki H. Am. J.

Care. 2002; 8: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Regarding the short term action of IL-1β, IL-1β has been reported to inhibit smooth muscle contractility by modulating the release of acetylcholine, norepinephrine, and substance P, all of which are neuromediators located in the rat myenteric plexus. However, these inhibitory effects disappear within a few hours (8.Main C. Blennerhassett P. Collins S.M. Gastroenterology. 1993; 104: 1648-1654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 9.Hurst S. Collins S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G30-G35PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Hurst S.M. Stanisz A.M. Sharkey K.A. Collins S.M. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 1754-1760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, concerning the chronic effects of IL-1β on intestinal motility, few data are available in published reports. The main reason for this lack of data is the difficulty of keeping the smooth muscle phenotype in cultured cells, i.e. smooth muscle cells in culture rapidly lose their contractile phenotype (11.Chamley-Campbell J. Campbell G.R. Ross R. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 1-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). One explanation for this loss is that the absence of extracellular matrix constituents accelerates a change of phenotype to that of proliferative smooth muscle (12.Li X. Tsai P. Wieder E.D. Kribben A. Van Putten V. Schrier R.W. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19653-19658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Thyberg J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 169: 183-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, because of the presence of a surrounding matrix, an organ culture system is effective for use in assessing the long term effects of IL-1β on modification of intestinal smooth muscle functions. In vascular diseases such as arteriosclerosis, it is well known that many inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β and growth factors, affect vascular smooth muscle differentiation (14.Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19369) Google Scholar). Smooth muscle cells change from a contractile to a proliferative phenotype, which in turn leads to a change in the expression levels of contractile proteins such as α-actin and myosin heavy chains, resulting in a reduction in force generation (15.Aikawa M. Sivam P.N. Kuro-o M. Kimura K. Nakahara K. Takewaki S. Ueda M. Yamaguchi H. Yazaki Y. Periasamy M. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 1000-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 16.Sartore S. Chiavegato A. Franch R. Faggin E. Pauletto P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1210-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These phenomena observed in vascular proliferative disease have been well reproduced in rabbit mesenteric artery using organ culture method in which tissues have been treated with fetal bovine serum, a mixed source of various growth factors (17.Yamawaki H. Sato K. Hori M. Ozaki H. Nakamura S. Nakayama H. Doi K. Karaki H. Life Sci. 2000; 67: 807-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Smooth muscle contractile system is basically regulated by myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which is driven by the balance between MLCK activity and myosin phosphatase activity (18.Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). During receptor agonist-induced contractions, contractile elements are sensitized to Ca2+ to induce a greater MLC phosphorylation and greater force at a given cytosolic Ca2+ level (19.Hori M. Karaki H. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1629-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20.Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 522: 177-185Crossref Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 21.Pfitzer G. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that a small GTP-binding protein, RhoA, and RhoA-dependent coiled-coil serine/threonine kinases (ROCKs) play a major role in Ca2+ sensitization. The activated RhoA (RhoA-GTP) activates ROCKs, which in turn phosphorylate a noncatalytic subunit of myosin phosphatase (MYPT-1) inactivating the myosin phosphatase activity. On the other hand, receptor stimulation also activates PKC. The activated PKC phosphorylates PKC-potentiated phosphatase inhibitor protein-17 (CPI-17) (22.Eto M. Senba S. Morita F. Yazawa M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 23.Senba S. Eto M. Yazawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), which in turn inactivates myosin phosphatase. As a result, MLCK-induced MLC phosphorylation is augmented to induce a greater contraction at a given cytosolic Ca2+. In addition, it appears that CPI-17 phosphorylation can also be produced by RhoA/ROCKs or RhoA/PKN after the receptor stimulation (24.Kitazawa T. Eto M. Woodsome T.P. Khalequzzaman M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 546: 879-889Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 25.Koyama M. Ito M. Feng J. Seko T. Shiraki K. Takase K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T.

In the present study, using an organ culture system, we investigated whether long term treatment with IL-1β can affect the contractile response of ileal smooth muscle, and how it changes the contractile mechanism. We found that long term exposure of IL-1β selectively reduces the force generation due to activation of G protein-coupled receptor, by increasing myosin phosphatase activity resulting from the changes in CPI-17 and MYPT-1 activities in intestinal smooth muscles. Tissue Preparation and Organ Culture Procedure—Animal care and treatment were conducted in conformity with the institutional guidelines of the University of Tokyo and are consistent with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from the National Institutes of Health. Male Wistar rats (200–250 g) were euthanized by a sharp blow to the neck and exsanguination. A 10–15-cm segment of the ileum was detached from mesenterium and placed in sterile Hanks' balanced salt solution. Strips were teased along the natural line of cleavage from the longitudinal smooth muscle. The strips were then transferred to culture dishes with Medium 199 (M199; Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% antibiotic and antimycotic (Invitrogen) and l-glutamine (200 μm; Invitrogen). The culture dishes were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. The incubation medium was replaced every day. Freshly isolated smooth muscle strips were prepared as described above but not under sterile conditions. Measurement of Muscle Tension—The strips were placed in normal physiological salt solution, which contained (mm) NaCl 136.9, KCl 5.4, CaCl2 1.5, MgCl2 1.0, NaHCO3 23.8, and glucose 5.5. 1 μm EDTA was also added to remove contaminating heavy metal ions. The high K+ (72.7 mm) solution was prepared by replacing NaCl with equimolar KCl. These solutions were saturated with 95% O2, 5% CO2 mixture at 37 °C and pH 7.4. Muscle tension was recorded isometrically with a force-displacement transducer. Each of the muscle strips was attached to a holder under a resting tension of 10 mn. After equilibration for 15 min in a 10- or 20-ml bath, each strip was repeatedly exposed to high K+ solution until responses became stable. Concentration-response curves were obtained by the cumulative application of agonists. At the end of the tension measurements, the wet weight of each muscle strip was measured. Contractile force is shown in mn/g wet weight of tissue. Permeabilized Muscle—Permeabilized muscle was prepared by treating the intestinal smooth muscle strips with Staphylococcus aureus α-toxin (80 μg/ml, 30 min; Sigma), as described previously (27.Kitazawa T. Kobayashi S. Horiuti K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5339-5342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Nishimura J. Kolber M. van Breemen C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The relaxing solution contained Mg2+-dimethanesulfonate 7.1 mm, K+ methanesulphonate 108.0 mm, ATP 5.9 mm, creatine phosphate 2.0 mm, PIPES 20.0 mm, EGTA 2.0 mm, creatine phosphokinase 10 units/ml, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone 1 μm, and E-64 1 μg/ml, pH 6.8. Free Ca2+ concentrations were changed by adding an appropriate amount of Ca2+-dimethanesulfonate. The apparent binding constant of EGTA for Ca2+ was considered to be 1 μm. Contractile force was measured by an isometric transducer under a resting tension of 1 mn at room temperature (22–24 °C). Concentration-response curves were obtained by cumulative application of Ca2+ (0.1–30 μm). Western Blot Analysis—Muscle strips of rat ileum were homogenized in each suitable homogenizing buffer to extract each protein. Homogenizing buffer to extract α-actin and MLC contained 500 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 8 m urea, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. Homogenizing buffer to extract MLCK and PP1 contained 500 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. Homogenizing buffer to extract RhoA and ROCKs contained 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. Homogenizing solution to extract CPI-17 and MYPT-1 contained 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% SDS, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm EGTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. All homogenizing solutions contained 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. After centrifugation of homogenized samples for 30 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C, the supernatant was used for the analysis. 10 μg (α-actin, MLC) 20 μg (MLCK, PP1, RhoA, ROCK-II, MYPT-1, and CPI-17), or 40 μg (ROCK-I) of total proteins purified from rat ileum were mounted in each lane, and SDS-PAGE of 7.5, 10, or 15% was performed to separate each protein. After electrophoresis was completed, separated proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane. The PVDF membrane was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) and then treated with PBS containing 5% skim milk as a blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature.

After washing the membrane with PBS/Tween (four times for 5 min), matched secondary antibodies were treated with blocking buffer for 1 h. Each protein was detected using alkaline phosphatase staining or peroxidase staining. The stained membranes were saved as images using an EPSON GT-9600 color scanner (EPSON, Tokyo, Japan). MLC Phosphorylation—Phosphorylation was detected as described previously (29.Word R.A. Casey M.L. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C861-C867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) under the isometric conditions described under “Measurement of Muscle Tension.” At the planned times during contractions induced by 72.7 mm high K+ solution and carbachol, the strips were quickly frozen in acetone/dry ice containing 10 mm DTT, 10 mm sodium thioglycolate, and 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The strips and trichloroacetic acid/acetone/dry ice solution were then gradually warmed to 4 °C. The strips were homogenized in sampling buffer containing 10 mm DTT, 8 m urea, 20 mm Tris, and 23 mm glycine, pH 8.6. Equal amounts of protein (8–12 μg/lane) were loaded on each lane of glycerol-PAGE. The proteins were separated by electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were incubated for 30 min in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with anti-MLC antibody (1:1000 dilution of monoclonal rabbit anti-bovine tracheal MLC antibody, kindly donated by Dr. J.

MLCs were detected using alkaline phosphatase staining. The stained membranes were saved as images using an EPSON GT-9600 color scanner (EPSON, Tokyo, Japan). MYPT-1 and CPI-17 Phosphorylation—Phosphorylation was detected under the isometric conditions described under “Measurement of Muscle Tension.” At the planned times during contractions induced by carbachol, the strips were quickly frozen in acetone/dry ice containing 10 mm DTT, 10 mm sodium thioglycolate/ and 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid.

The strips were homogenized in sampling buffer containing 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% SDS, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm EGTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. 20 μg of total proteins purified from rat ileum were mounted in each lane, and 7.5 or 15% SDS-PAGE was performed to separate each protein. After electrophoresis was completed, separated proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane. The PVDF membrane was washed with PBS (pH 7.4) and then treated with PBS containing 5% skim milk as a blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Anti-phosphorylated MYPT-1 antibody (p-MYPT-1 (Thr-696), 1:1000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-phosphorylated CPI-17 antibody (p-CPI-17 (Thr-38), 1:250 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were treated with blocking buffer overnight as the first antibody at 4 °C. After washing the membrane with PBS/Tween (four times for 5 min), matched secondary antibodies were treated with blocking buffer for 1 h. Each protein was detected using alkaline phosphatase staining or peroxidase staining. The stained membranes were saved as images using an EPSON GT-9600 color scanner (EPSON, Tokyo, Japan). Chemicals—The chemicals used are as follows: ATP, creatine phosphate, creatine phosphokinase, E-64, EGTA, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, indomethacin, GTP (Sigma), EDTA, PIPES (Dojindo Laboratories, Japan), DTT, trichloroacetic acid, l-NMMA (Wako Pure Chemical, Japan), sodium thioglycolate (Nakarai Chemicals, LTD, Kyoto, Japan), GTPγS (Roche Applied Science), DPB (Funakoshi, Japan), K252a, Y-27632, HA-1077, and bisindolylmaleimide I (Calbiochem). Statistical Analyses—Results are expressed as means ± S.E. The comparison between the control and the test group was performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test. For all evaluations, p values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. As a preliminary experiment, we performed a morphological examination of the long term effects of IL-1β in rat ileal tissue. In the layer of freshly isolated ileal smooth muscle tissue, flat-shaped smooth muscle cells were arranged in an ordinary fashion. In the layer of either control or IL-1β-treated tissue (10 ng/ml for 3 days), most of the smooth muscle cells were also arranged in the ordinary fashion, indicating that the tissue was intact after the culture in M199 with or without IL-1β for 3 days (data not shown). Contractions in the Organ-cultured Tissue—We examined the effects of chronic treatment with IL-1β on contractility in response to high K+ and carbachol in the organ-cultured rat ileum. The high K+- and carbachol-induced contractions were well maintained in the tissue cultured in M199 for 3 days, as reported previously in other intestinal tissues (30.Sward K. Nilsson B.O. Hellstrand P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C77-C84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Lesh R.E. Somlyo A.P. Owens G.K. Somlyo A.V. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the presence of 10 ng/ml IL-1β, contractions elicited by high K+ and carbachol were inhibited in a time-dependent manner, and the degree of IL-1β-induced inhibition was much greater in the carbachol-induced contractions than the high K+-induced contractions. The concentration dependence of IL-1β indicates that 0.1 and 1 ng/ml IL-1β induce less inhibition of contractile forces in ileal smooth muscles cultured for 3 days (Fig. 1C). We also attempted to determine whether IL-1β affects the IC50 value for carbachol. Cumulative addition of carbachol (1 nm to 100 μm) caused concentration-dependent contractions in ileal smooth muscle tissue cultured with or without IL-1β for 3 days and also in freshly isolated tissue. There was no difference between concentration-response curves in freshly isolated, control, and IL-1β-treated tissues (IC50 values: fresh, –6.73 ± 0.07 versus control, –6.81 ± 0.23 versus IL-1β, –6.83 ± 0.24; n = 8). In vascular smooth muscles, IL-1β has been shown to stimulate iNOS expression that results in a reduction of contractile force (32.Busse R. Mulsch A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 33.Kuemmerle J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G178-G185PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, iNOS expression is often associated with the expression of COX-2 (34.Milano S. Arcoleo F. Dieli M. D'Agostino R. D'Agostino P. De Nucci G. Cillari E. Prostaglandins. 1995; 49: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 35.Hori M. Kita M. Torihashi S. Miyamoto S. Won K.J. Sato K. Ozaki H. Karaki H. Am. J.

Therefore, we next examined the effects of NO synthase inhibitor, l-NMMA (300 μm), and also COX inhibitor, indomethacin (10 μm), on smooth muscle contractility that had already been modified by IL-1β treatment. To maintain intracellular l-Arg concentrations high enough to support the NO generation, l-Arg (1 mm) was added to the bath solution (37.Weisbrodt N.W. Pressley T.A. Li Y.F. Zembowicz M.J. Higham S.C. Zembowicz A. Lodato R.F. Moody F.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G454-G460PubMed Google Scholar). l-Arg alone had no effect on the carbachol-induced contractions in both control tissues and those treated with IL-1β for 3 days. In addition, l-NMMA (300 μm) did not change the carbachol-induced contractions in tissues treated with or without IL-1β. Furthermore, indomethacin (10 μm) did not affect the carbachol-induced contractions of smooth muscle tissues cultured with or without IL-1β (p = 0.457). These results are summarized in Table I. Moreover, treatment with both l-NMMA and indomethacin did not restore the reduced high K+-induced contractions elicited by IL-1β treatment (data not shown).Table IEffects of the substrate of NO synthesis, l-Arg (1 mm), NO synthase inhibitor, l-NMMA (300 μm), and COX-2 inhibitor, indomethacin (10 μm), on carbachol (1 μm)-induced contractions in rat ileal smooth muscle cultured with or without IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for 3 daysTreatmentControl (mn/mg w/w)IL-1β (mn/mg w/w)Exp. 1 Control14.4 ± 2.8 (n = 12)6.3 ± 1.9 (n = 6) l-Arg (1 mm)13.9 ± 2.6 (n = 12)5.9 ± 2.0 (n = 6) l-Arg (1 mm) + L-NMMA (300 μm)13.4 ± 2.5 (n = 12)5.7 ± 2.1 (n = 6)Exp. 2 Control12.3 ± 3.9 (n = 12)6.5 ± 3.3 (n = 6) Indomethacin (10 μm)10.8 ± 3.8 (n = 12)5.1 ± 2.7 (n = 6) Open table in a new tab MLC Phosphorylation—We measured the phosphorylation of 20-kDa MLC, which regulates the contractions of smooth muscle. As shown in Fig. 2, the levels of MLC phosphorylation in IL-1β-treated strips in the resting state did not differ from the control (n = 10 each). When contractions were induced in response to treatment with carbachol (1 μm) for 30 s, the MLC phosphorylation levels significantly increased. In the IL-1β-treated tissues, however, the levels of MLC phosphorylation induced by carbachol were significantly smaller than those in the control tissues (control, 23.5 ± 2.0%, n = 9, versus IL-1β, 13.4 ± 1.6%, n = 9; p < 0.01). Treatment of the tissue with high K+ for 30 s also increased MLC phosphorylation, and this was not significantly reduced by the IL-1β treatment (control, 25.7 ± 1.8%, n = 13, versus IL-1β, 20.2 ± 2.6%, n = 13). Contractions in Permeabilized Muscle—In α-toxin-permeabilized muscle, functional proteins in cytosol are retained, and internal Ca2+ concentrations can be clamped in order to evaluate Ca2+ sensitivity and the contractility of the contractile apparatus (27.Kitazawa T. Kobayashi S. Horiuti K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5339-5342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Nishimura J. Kolber M. van Breemen C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In the permeabilized muscle prepared from the control tissues, cumulative addition of Ca2+ (0.1–30 μm) caused concentration-dependent contractions. As shown in Fig. 3A, in control tissues Ca2+ (1 μm) induced 30–50% of the maximum contractions induced by 30 μm Ca2+. Pretreatment of the muscle with 10 μm carbachol in the presence of 100 μm GTP increased the contractions elicited by 1 μm Ca2+(p < 0.01). The Ca2+ sensitization induced by carbachol with GTP in the presence of 1 μm Ca2+ was significantly reduced by the IL-1β treatment (control, 74.2 ± 4.7%, n = 8, versus IL-1β, 53.8 ± 2.8%, n = 6, p < 0.01). Instead of carbachol with GTP, the addition of 100 μm GTPγS also significantly increased the Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile element (Fig. 3A), and the level of contractile force was significantly decreased by IL-1β treatment (control, 122.0 ± 4.1%, n = 9, versus IL-1β, 82.5 ± 8.1%, n = 7, p < 0.01). We next examined the effects of DPB, an activator of PKC, on Ca2+-induced contractions in the muscle permeabilized with α-toxin. In both control and IL-1β-treated tissues, the relative contractile force induced by 1 μm Ca2+ was significantly increased by 10 μm DPB (p < 0.01). However, the degree of augmentation of the contractile force was much smaller than that of the GTP-mediated responses. In addition, the relative force induced by 1 μm Ca2+ with DPB was slightly but not significantly decreased by the IL-1β treatment. We finally compared the contractile force induced by 30 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 3C). The absolute force induced by 30 μm Ca2+ was significantly decreased by the IL-1β treatment (control, 133.6 ± 15.6 mn/mm2versus IL-1β, 72.8 ± 12.3 mn/mm2, n = 14–16; p < 0.01).

https://openalex.org/W2039750130,"Mitochondria play a pivotal role as an ATP generator in aerobically growing cells, and their defects have long been implicated in the cellular aging process, although its detailed underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Recently, we found that, in the cellular senescent process of Chang cells induced by desferroxamine mesylate, an iron chelator, a significant decrease of intracellular ATP level was accompanied by decline in complex II activity, which preceded acquisition of the senescent phenotype. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of how the mitochondrial ATP productivity was damaged by iron chelation and how complex II defect was involved in the senescent arrest. The ATP loss was irreversible and accompanied by sustained collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), but the ATP loss itself did not seem to be essential in progression to the senescent arrest. The Δψm disruption was due to decreased mitochondrial respiration, which was primarily associated with the defective complex II activity. Furthermore, we found that the declined activity of complex II was mainly due to down-regulation of protein expression of the iron-sulfur subunit, which was associated with the irreversibility of the arrest. Finally, we demonstrated that specific inhibition of complex II with 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone induced overall delay of the cell cycle, suggesting that the delayed arrest by desferroxamine mesylate might be in part due to inhibition of complex II activity. Taken together, our results suggest that complex II might be considered as one of the primary factors to regulate mitochondrial respiratory function by responding to the cellular iron level, thereby influencing cellular growth.

Maintenance of energy in a cell is critical to the cellular growth and proliferation. In aerobically growing cells, most of cellular energy is primarily generated through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) 1The abbreviations used are: OXPHOSoxidative phosphorylationDFOdesferroxamine mesylateΔψmmitochondrial membrane potentialROSreactive oxygen speciesTGF-β1transforming growth factor β1TTFA2-thenoyltrifluoroacetoneSA-β-galsenescence-associated β-galactosidaseNCRNADH-cytochrome c reductaseSCRsuccinatecytochrome c reductaseSQRsuccinate-ubiquinone reductaseIRPiron regulatory proteinIREiron-responsive elementFpflavoproteinIpiron-sulfur proteinQPsubiquinine-binding proteinUTRuntranslated regionDTBdouble thymidine blockDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFBSfetal bovine serumPBSphosphate-buffered salineDNP2,4-dinitrophenolRTreverse transcriptase.1The abbreviations used are: OXPHOSoxidative phosphorylationDFOdesferroxamine mesylateΔψmmitochondrial membrane potentialROSreactive oxygen speciesTGF-β1transforming growth factor β1TTFA2-thenoyltrifluoroacetoneSA-β-galsenescence-associated β-galactosidaseNCRNADH-cytochrome c reductaseSCRsuccinatecytochrome c reductaseSQRsuccinate-ubiquinone reductaseIRPiron regulatory proteinIREiron-responsive elementFpflavoproteinIpiron-sulfur proteinQPsubiquinine-binding proteinUTRuntranslated regionDTBdouble thymidine blockDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFBSfetal bovine serumPBSphosphate-buffered salineDNP2,4-dinitrophenolRTreverse transcriptase. in the form of ATP. The OXPHOS is composed of the four respiratory chain complexes and F1F0-ATP synthase (complex V). The respiratory chain comprises NADH-ubiquinone reductase (NQR or complex I), succinate-ubiquinone reductase (SQR; complex II), ubiquinolcytochrome c reductase (complex III), and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV). Accompanied by an electron transfer reaction through the respiratory complexes, the proton gradient is generated across the mitochondrial inner membrane, and the resulting Δψm is dissipated via complex V to synthesize ATP (1Saraste M. Science. 1999; 283: 1488-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 2Nicholls D.G. Ferguson S.J. Bioenergetics 2. Academic Press, Inc., London, UK1992: 107-154Google Scholar). When mitochondrial respiration is disrupted by limited oxygen supply (hypoxic) or by any other reason, the cells often adopt a metabolic switch from aerobic to fermentative ATP production to keep the ATP level in order to survive against the stringent aerobic energy production (3Dang C.V. Semenza G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 68-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). However, when overall energy supply is insufficient regardless of various causes, growth of cells is impeded, and they are destined to death through apoptotic or necrotic process, depending on the cellular ATP level (4Leist M. Single B. Castoldi A.F. Kuhnle S. Nicotera P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar, 5Eguchi Y. Shimizu S. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1835-1840PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the loss of mitochondrial respiratory control also contributes to release of apoptogenic factors from mitochondria in addition to overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in stressed or growth factor-deprived cells (6Green D.R.

The mitochondrial damage has long been implicated in the aging process, because the mitochondrion is particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress in addition to its function as a major generator of free radicals, which have been firmly recognized as a causal actor of the aging process (10Finkel T.

Sci. 1992; 671: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, in intact hepatocytes, an age-dependent decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential was also shown, together with increased mitochondrial ROS generation (18Sastre J. Pallardo F.V.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 994-1003Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Although overall mitochondrial defect and mitochondrial ROS generation have generally been observed in aging and cellular senescent process, there has yet been no study to show direct involvement of a defect of specific respiratory complex, except recent reports that a mutation in the cytochome b subunit of complex II caused oxidative stress, resulting in premature aging in nematode (20Ishii N.

Iron is an essential element in mitochondrial respiration, because the electron carriers within the respiratory complexes such as cytochromes and iron-sulfur clusters utilize iron as direct electron acceptors and donors (2Nicholls D.G. Ferguson S.J. Bioenergetics 2. Academic Press, Inc., London, UK1992: 107-154Google Scholar, 22Oexle H. Gnaiger E. Weiss G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1413: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mitochondrial respiratory activities are predicted to be sensitive to cellular iron levels. We recently reported that DFO induced Chang cells, an immortalized normal human hepatocyte cell lines, to senescence-like irreversible growth arrest. During the arrest, a specific induction of TGF-β1 and p27kip1 was accompanied, implying its associated role in arresting the cell cycle progression at G1 phase (23Yoon G. Kim H-J. Yoon Y-S. Cho H. Lim I.K. Lee J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, their induction was observed after only 3 days of exposure to DFO, and neutralization of TGF-β1 could not reverse the arrest, suggesting that other mechanisms are involved in the cellular commitment to the irreversible senescent arrest at the earlier stage. In the present study, we have elucidated that during the DFO-induced senescent arrest, complex II activity was disrupted at the earlier stage through down-regulation of iron-sulfur protein, its second largest subunit, and was accompanied with the irreversible Δψm disruption and concomitant decline of ATP level. Furthermore, we found that a specific inhibitor of complex II activity, 2-theonyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), delayed the overall cell cycle progression, as in the case of DFO. These observations led us to conclude that complex II could be considered as one of the primary factors to regulate mitochondrial function by responding to the intracellular iron level, thus influencing cellular growth rate by controlling the overall progression of the cell cycle. Cell Culture, DFO Treatment, and Transfection Condition—Chang cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) or DMEM (high glucose) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 in air. Cells (5 × 105) were seeded into 100-mm culture plates, cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h, and treated with 500 μm DFO for the indicated periods. The cells were continuously cultured by refreshing every 3 days with the medium containing DFO, and, if necessary, the cells were split to maintain subconfluence. Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE reagent according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Determination of Cellular ATP Level—Cellular ATP levels were measured by the bioluminescence assay according to the protocol provided with an ATP determination kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). In brief, cells cultured in the absence or presence of DFO for the indicated periods were lysed with passive lysis buffer (Promega), and protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Cell lysate (5 μg) was mixed with 100 μl of luciferase reagent, and luminescence was analyzed with 10-s integration on a luminometer (TD-20/20; Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA). The ATP concentration of the samples was calculated from a calibration curve performed for known ATP concentration performed at the same time. The ATP levels were expressed as pmol of ATP/μg of cellular lysate protein. Mitochondrial Transmembrane Potential (Δψm)—Δψm was estimated using 5,5′-6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetrathylbenzimidazole carbocyanide iodide (JC-1; Molecular Probes). Mitochondria with intact membrane potential concentrate JC-1 into J-aggregates that fluoresce red (emission, 590 nm), whereas de-energized mitochondria cannot concentrate JC-1 and fluoresce green (emission, 527 nm). To assess the Δψm changes of cells exposed to DFO, the cells were incubated for 1 h with 10 μg/ml JC-1; washed with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4); and finally visualized by a fluoromicroscope (Diaphot 300; Nikon). To quantitate the degree of disrupted Δψm, the cells stained with JC-1 were collected by trypsinization and resuspended in PBS, and the green fluorescences of the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS Vantage; Becton Dickinson corp.). The intensity of the green fluorescence was considered as a degree of Δψm disruption. In addition, the Δψm-dependent fluorescence dye, tetramethylrhodamine methylester perchlorate, was also applied to quantitate the degree of Δψm of the DFO-treated cells. In the case of tetramethylrhodamine methylester perchlorate, cells were incubated with 0.1 μm tetramethylrhodamine methylester perchlorate for 10 min, washed with PBS, and trypsinized for flow cytometric analysis. Higher red fluorescence indicates cells with more active mitochondria. Senescence-associated β-Galactosidase Assay—Senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) was assayed at pH 6.0 as described by Dimri et al. (24Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5558) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Briefly, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed to plates by 3% formaldehyde for 5 min, washed with PBS, and then incubated overnight in freshly prepared staining solution (40 mm citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 1 mg/ml of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal; Sigma), 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2). The stain was visible 12 h after incubation at 37 °C. Assays for Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain Activities—The activities of NADH-cytochrome c reductase (NCR), the integrated activity of complexes I and III and succinate-cytochrome c reductase (SCR), the integrated activity of complex II and III, and SQR alone in cell lysate were measured as described previously (26Esposti M.D. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 75-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modification. Briefly, cell pellets were lysed in PES buffer, and a portion (50 μg) of lysate was used for each assay. To determine NCR activities, the initial rate to reduce cytochrome c in the presence of NADH was monitored at 550 nm with NCR reaction mixture (50 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20 μm cytochrome c) and 2 mm KCN. The reaction is started by the addition of 100 μm NADH with a rapid mix to detect the rotenone-sensitive initial rate. For SCR activities, TTFA-sensitive initial rate to reduce cytochrome c in the presence of succinate was monitored at 550 nm with SCR mixture (50 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.25 mm EDTA, 20 μm cytochrome c, 20 mm sodium succinate) and 2 mm KCN. The specific activities of NCR and SCR are expressed as pmol of reduced cytochrome c/mg of lysate protein for 1 min by spectrophotometrically (Ultrospec 3000; Amersham Biosciences) following the increase of absorbance of reduced cytochrome c at room temperature. Succinate-ubiquinone reductase activity was assayed through the succinate-ubiquinone-dichlorophenolindophenol activity. A portion (50 μg) of lysate was added to the reaction mixture (20 mm sodium succinate, 25 mm sodium/potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 2 μg/ml antimycin, 2 μg/ml rotenone, 2 mm KCN, 50 μm dichlorophenolindophenol), and the reaction was started by adding 65 μm coenzyme Q10 (Sigma). The initial rate of dichlorophenolindophenol reduction was measured at 600 nm in a Ultrospec 3000. Differential Spectrum of Cytochrome c—1 ml of 100 μm cytochrome c (Sigma) was incubated at the indicated temperature for a certain period of time in the absence or presence of DFO. Differential spectrum of reduced minus oxidized cytochrome c between 500 and 600 nm was obtained from the dithionite minus potassium ferricyanide-treated spectrum using a spectrophotometer (Ultrospec 4300; Amersham Biosciences). The absorbance differences between 550 and at 580 nm of the spectra were represented for redox capacity of cytochrome c. Endogenous Cellular Oxygen Consumption—Endogenous respiration was measured as described previously (27Villani G. Attardi G. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 119-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modification. Briefly, exponentially growing Chang cells (5 × 106) were cultured in the absence or presence of DFO, washed with TD buffer (0.137 m NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), and collected by trypsinization. After resuspending the cells in 0.3 ml of complete medium without phenol red, the cells were transferred to the chamber of Mitocell equipped with a Clark oxygen electrode (782 Oxygen Meter; Strathkelvin Instruments, Glasgow, UK). Oxygen consumption rates were measured after adding 30 μm 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) to obtain the maximum respiration rate, and its specificity for mitochondrial respiration was confirmed by adding 5 mm KCN. Maximum cellular respiration rates were expressed as the ratio of DNP-uncoupled versus KCN-inhibited O2 consumption rate. Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from each subconfluent culture by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 1 μg of total RNA was used as template for cDNA synthesis with avian myeloblastosis virus RT XL using RNA PCR kit version 2.1 (Takara Inc., Shiga, Japan). Subsequently, PCR cycles were performed by using one-tenth volume of cDNA synthesis reaction mixture. The final RT-PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gel, stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide solution, and visualized on a UV transilluminator (Gel Doc 2000; Bio-Rad). The sequences of the primer sets used in this study were as follows: for human GAPDH, 5′-CCATGGAGAAGGCTGGGG-3′ and 5′-CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC-3′; for QPs1, 5′-CCCAGATCTTTGGGAACCACGGCCAAA-3′ and 5′-CCCCTCGAGCATGGCTGCCAGCCCCATAG-3′; for QPs2, 5′-CCCGGATCCGGCTCCAAGGCTGCATCT-3′ and 5′-CCCCTCGAGCTTCCACAGCATGGCAAC-3′. Western Blot Analysis and Antibodies—Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). A portion (50 μg) of the lysate protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were electrically transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Protran; Schleicher and Schuell). The membrane was blocked for 1 h at 24 °C with blocking solution (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) nonfat milk). Subsequently, the membranes were incubated in blocking solution at 4 °C with the 1 μg/ml of available monoclonal antibodies against subunits of OXPHOS complexes (complex II-Fp, A11142; complex II-Ip, A11141; complex I, A11140; complex III, A11143; complex IV subunit 1, A6403; complex IV subunit IV-A6431, complex V, A11144; Molecular Probes), α-actin (sc-1615, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), or α-tubulin (Ab-1; Oncogene, Boston, MA). Membranes were then washed twice with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 24 °C. Detection was carried out by treating the membranes with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and exposing them to x-ray film. Cell Synchronization and Cell Cycle Analysis—Chang cells were synchronized at late G1 phase by thymidine double treatment (0.5 mg/ml) for 18 h with an 8-h interval. The cells were released from the synchronization by refreshing the medium in the absence or presence of 0.4 mm TTFA or 0.5 mm DFO and collected at the indicated times. Cell cycle analysis was performed by propidium iodide staining according to the protocol provided with CycleTEST™ PLUS DNA reagent kit (Becton Dickinson). Briefly, cells were trypsinized, collected by centrifugation, and washed with and resuspended in PBS before fixing in 70% ethanol at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. According to the protocol, the fixed cells were stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide for at least 10 min before flow cytometric analysis (Becton-Dickinson FACsorter). The instrument was set to collect 1 × 104 cells, and the cell cycle profile was analyzed using CELLQuest software. For analyzing the effect of TTFA on cell cycle patterns of asynchronous cells, subconfluent cells were treated with or without 0.4 mm TTFA for the indicated periods and then collected. Total Cellular ATP Level Decreased Significantly with Concurrent Δψm Disruption in DFO-induced Senescent Arrest—In order to address the possibility that mitochondrial activity could be a primary target of iron depletion in the senescent arrest induced by DFO, total cellular ATP level was determined. As shown in Fig. 1A, Chang cells contained about 16 pmol of ATP/1 μg of lysate protein when they were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS. When treated with DFO, the total cellular ATP level significantly decreased to 8.7 pmol/μg of lysate (53.8% of control) within 1 day but did not decrease further thereafter. This finding implied that elucidation of mechanisms involved in the ATP loss within 24 h could greatly help in finding the specific target of iron depletion. We next monitored Δψm by staining cells with Δψm-dependent JC-1 fluorescence dye in order to investigate the mechanism of how the cellular ATP level decreased. As the exposure time to DFO increased, green fluorescence-stained cells, which represented the cells harboring inactive mitochondria with low Δψm, continuously increased, whereas the cells with active red fluorescence-stained mitochondria decreased (Fig. 1B). This result suggested that the ATP loss was mainly due to the Δψm disruption. However, it should be noted that the total cellular ATP level was still maintained at half the control level until the end of experiment (up to the 7th day), despite the continuously aggravated disruption of Δψm. Eventually, we found that the ATP level after Δψm disruption was partially complemented by activated glycolytic ATP production (data not shown). Next, we attempted to restore the DFO-induced cellular ATP loss with medium supplemented with high glucose in order to explore whether the ATP loss itself is critical to destine cells to the senescent arrest. As shown in Fig. 1C, with high glucose medium, the total cellular ATP level was maintained 1.6-fold higher than the control. During 3-day treatment of DFO in high glucose medium, the ATP level dropped to 51.8% of the control (no DFO treatment in high glucose), which was still comparable with that of the control cells (no DFO treatment) with normal medium. However, the Δψm of the cells was disrupted, and the cells gained SA-β-gal activity (Fig. 1C). These data suggested that the ATP loss itself was not important in the progression to senescent arrest; however, some other mitochondrial dysfunction related to mitochondrial OXPHOS might be involved. Similar Δψm disruption and cellular ATP loss by DFO were also observed in other hepatocyte cell lines such as Huh7 and Hep3B cells (Table I), in which gain of the senescent phenotype was previously confirmed (23Yoon G. Kim H-J. Yoon Y-S. Cho H. Lim I.K. Lee J. Biochem.

Open table in a new tab The Irreversible Δψm Disruption and ATP Loss Were Associated with the DFO-induced Senescent Arrest—In order to examine whether the disruption of mitochondrial ATP productivity was related to the irreversibility of the senescent arrest, Chang cells were treated with 1 mm DFO for various periods of time and then released by replacing the medium with fresh medium without DFO. Transient exposure of the cells to DFO for 1 day partially recovered the ATP level, but exposure for longer than 2 days induced irreversible ATP loss (Fig. 2A). This result was well correlated with the irreversible Δψm disruption and gain of SA-β-gal activity, as shown in Fig. 2B. Significant Inhibition of Complex II Activity Was Correlated with the Δψm Disruption and ATP Loss—To elucidate how Δψm was disrupted, we monitored the respiratory chain activities within 48 h of the exposure to DFO by assessing SCR (complex II-III-coupled) and NCR (complex I-III-coupled) activities. Whereas no changes were observed in NCR activities, except a slight increase at 48 h, SCR activity was decreased to 48% of the control at 6 h and to 22% at 12 and 24 h (Fig. 3A). The difference between NCR and SCR activity profiles represents the difference between complex I and II activities, because complex III is a common factor in both activities. Therefore, SQR activity alone was further examined, and we confirmed the significant decrease in SQR activity within 12 h (Fig. 3B). The inhibition of complex II activity was followed by Δψm disruption and ATP loss (Fig. 3C), implying that the disruption of mitochondrial activities could have been initiated by the inhibition of complex II activity. DFO Could Chelate Iron from Cytochrome c at 37 °C in Vitro—Next, a question arises how SQR activity could be inhibited by DFO. To address this question, we first examined whether the NQR or SCR activity was directly inhibited by DFO. However, no direct inhibition of the NCR and SCR activities was observed by the addition of DFO up to 2 mm (data not shown). Nevertheless, we could not exclude the possibility of the different experimental conditions between the above in vitro assay and cell culture system. SQR contains 10 irons in the form of intracomple"
https://openalex.org/W2065871961,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can be activated by both direct ligand binding and cross-talk with other molecules, such as integrins. This integrin-mediated cross-talk with growth factor receptors participates in regulating cell proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion. Previous studies have shown that ligand-dependent EGFR activation is inhibited by GM3, the predominant ganglioside of epithelial cells, but the effect of GM3 on ligand-independent, integrin-EGFR cross-talk is unknown. Using a squamous carcinoma cell line we show that endogenous accumulation of GM3 disrupts the ligand-independent association of the integrin β1 subunit with EGFR and results in inhibition of cell proliferation. Consistently, endogenous depletion of GM3 markedly increases the association of EGFR with tyrosine-phosphorylated integrin β1 and promotes cell proliferation. The ligand-independent stimulation of EGFR does not require focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation or cytoskeletal rearrangement. Stimulation of EGFR and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling by GM3 depletion involves the phosphorylation of EGFR at tyrosine residues 845, 1068, and 1148 but not 1086 or 1173. The specific blockade of phosphorylation at Tyr-845 with Src family kinase inhibition and at Tyr-1148 with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibition suggests that GM3 inhibits integrin-induced, ligand-independent EGFR phosphorylation (cross-talk) through suppression of Src family kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling.

Integrins are cell surface-adhesive receptors formed by α and β subunits, which bind to extracellular matrix proteins. Integrin-mediated adhesion to extracellular matrix triggers intracellular signaling pathways to modulate cell proliferation, shape, migration, invasion, and survival (for review see Refs. 1.Giancotti F.G.

Integrin signaling is mediated by intracellular molecules, such as c-Src, small GTPases, adaptor molecules such as Shc, the protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP-2, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (3.Clark E.A.

These studies show that endogenous alterations in GM3 expression influence the association of the EGFR and integrin β1 subunit and the resultant activation of the EGFR promoted by FN or type I, IV, and VII collagen, all triggers of β1 integrin activation. Furthermore, these investigations provide evidence that phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues on the EGFR is impacted by GM3 content modulation, including tyrosine residues that require Src kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling for phosphorylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells—The human keratinocyte-derived SCC12F2 cell line (SCC12), a generous gift from Dr. James Rheinwald (Harvard, Boston, MA), was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1, v/v) medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) without antibiotics in 5% CO2 at 37 °C.Overexpression of GM3 by Treatment with Antisense Oligodeoxynucleotides—Membrane content of GM3 on SCC12 cells was endogenously increased as described previously (24.Wang X.Q.

GT1b expression was endogenously up-regulated via stably transfected GM2/GD2 synthase cDNA into SCC12 cells using an inducible system as previously described (23.Wang X.Q. Sun P. Paller A.S. J. Biol.

When cells were grown in the absence of serum or growth factors but in the presence of FN, a statistically significant increase in proliferation of ganglioside-depleted cells versus control cells was noted within 24 h (Fig. 1B); the discrepancy in growth was further accentuated by 72 h of incubation (p < 0.001). Similarly, proliferation of GM3-overexpressing cells was significantly suppressed by 72 h incubation in the presence of FN (Fig. 1B).Fig. 1GM3 overexpression by antisense treatment inhibits cell proliferation, whereas ganglioside-depletion facilitates cell proliferation. To accumulate GM3 endogenously, SCC12 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with 10% FBS were treated with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides of both GM2/GD2 synthase (synthesizes GM2 from GM3) and GD3 synthase (synthesizes GD3 from GM3), effectively blocking GM3 metabolism (24.Wang X.Q.

In yeast, heme mediates the effect of oxygen on the expression of many genes involved in using or detoxifying oxygen. However, a direct link between intracellular heme level and oxygen concentration has not been vigorously established. In this report, we have examined the relationships among oxygen levels, heme levels, Hap1 activity, and HAP1 expression. We found that Hap1 activity is controlled in vivo by heme and not by its precursors and that heme activates Hap1 even in anoxic cells. We also found that Hap1 activity exhibits the same oxygen dose-response curves as Hap1-dependent aerobic genes and that these dose-response curves have a sharp break at ∼1 μm O2. The results show that the intracellular signaling heme level, reflected as Hap1 activity, is closely correlated with oxygen concentration. Furthermore, we found that bypass of all heme synthetic steps but ferrochelatase by deuteroporphyrin IX does not circumvent the need for oxygen in Hap1 full activation by heme, suggesting that the last step of heme synthesis, catalyzed by ferrochelatase, is also subjected to oxygen control. Our results show that multiple heme synthetic steps can sense oxygen concentration and provide significant insights into the mechanism of oxygen sensing in yeast.

These genes include CYC1, which encodes cytochrome c-iso-1; CYC7, which encodes cytochrome c-iso-2; CYT1, which encodes cytochrome c1; CTT1, which encodes catalase; and YHB1, which encodes yeast flavohemoglobin (3.Kwast K.E.

Hap1 also activates the transcription of the ROX1 and MOT3 genes, which repress hypoxic genes under aerobic conditions (3.Kwast K.E. Burke P.V. Poyton R.O. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 1177-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Zhang L. Hach A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 26.Zitomer R.S. Carrico P. Deckert J.

Thus, oxygen regulation of Rox1 and Mot3 activity is mediated by heme, through Hap1 (3.Kwast K.E. Burke P.V. Poyton R.O. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 1177-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Zhang L.

Like the HIFs in mammalian cells, none of these transcription factors sense oxygen directly but instead sense a molecule, heme, whose synthesis is dependent on oxygen as part of their oxygen sensing machinery. Given the importance of heme in oxygen-regulated gene expression, it is pertinent to ask how oxygen concentration is monitored by heme. There appear to be two possibilities. On the one hand, oxygen concentration may control the level of an intracellular heme pool that regulates Hap1. On the other hand, oxygen concentration and, by extension, intracellular redox may regulate Hap1 or a protein with which it interacts. It has been suggested that intracellular heme synthesis is affected by the oxygen concentration that cells experience (29.Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7278-7283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Labbe-Bois R. Labbe P. Dailey H.A. Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1990: 235-285Google Scholar), because two enzymes involved in heme synthesis, coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (Hem13p) (31.Zagorec M. Buhler J.M. Treich I. Keng T. Guarente L. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9718-9724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and protoporphyrinogen oxidase (Hem14p) (32.Camadro J.M. Labbe P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9120-9128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), use oxygen as a substrate (Fig. 1). However, measurement of heme levels after chemical extraction from aerobic and anoxic yeast cells has revealed only a 2-fold difference, 2T. Hon, A. Dodd, R. Dirmeier, N. Gorman, P. R. Sinclair, L. Zhang, and R. O. Poyton, unpublished data.2T. Hon, A. Dodd, R. Dirmeier, N. Gorman, P. R. Sinclair, L. Zhang, and R. O. Poyton, unpublished data. which is far too small to account for the difference in Hap1 activity under aerobic and anoxic conditions. These findings make it clear that Hap1 activity is not related to total intracellular heme concentration. One possible explanation of these findings is that Hap1 activity is affected only by a specific free heme pool. The existence of such a pool has been suggested by studies with mammalian cells that have led to the idea that there are at least two pools of intracellular heme (30.Labbe-Bois R. Labbe P. Dailey H.A. Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1990: 235-285Google Scholar, 33.Andrew T.L. Riley P.G. Dailey H.A. Dailey H.A. Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1990: 183-232Google Scholar, 34.Anderson K.E. Sassa S. Bishop D.F. Desnick R.J. Vogelstein B. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. Vol. 2. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York2001: 2991-3062Google Scholar): an “immobilized” pool that is bound to proteins (e.g. flavohemoglobin, catalases, peroxidases, and cytochromes) and a “free” pool, which could be available for regulatory signaling. Because total heme that has been chemically extracted would come from both cellular heme pools, any changes in the free heme pool could be masked by the immobilized heme pool because the size of this pool exceeds the size of the free heme pool (30.Labbe-Bois R. Labbe P. Dailey H.A. Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1990: 235-285Google Scholar, 33.Andrew T.L. Riley P.G. Dailey H.A. Dailey H.A.

The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. Vol. 2. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York2001: 2991-3062Google Scholar). A second explanation for the lack in correlation between Hap1 activity and total heme concentration is that Hap1 activity is not affected by heme concentration per se but instead may be affected by the redox state of a heme protein. This protein would be expected to be more oxidized in aerobic cells and more reduced in anoxic cells. It is also possible that both heme redox and heme concentration function in oxygen sensing but do so differentially at different oxygen concentrations (4.Poyton R.O. Respir. Physiol. 1999; 115: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To clarify further how heme functions to mediate the effects of oxygen concentration on the expression of oxygen-regulated genes, and to understand better the molecular mechanism of oxygen sensing in yeast, we address here the relationships among oxygen concentration, heme synthesis, and Hap1 activity. We ask which steps of the heme synthetic pathway may mediate oxygen control of intracellular heme synthesis and signaling heme level. We found that multiple heme synthetic steps, including the last step, catalyzed by ferrochelatase, can mediate oxygen control. Yeast Strains and Reporters—Yeast strains used were JM43 (Matα his4-580 leu2-3, 112 ura3-52) [ρ+] (35.McEwen J.E. Ko C. Kloeckner-Gruissem B. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11872-11879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), BWG1-7a (a, ura3-52, leu2-3, 112, his4-519, ade1-100), MHY100 (a, ura3-52, leu2-3, 112, his4-519, ade1-100, hem1-Δ100), and MHY100Δhem15 (a, ura3-52, leu2-3, 112, his4-519, ade1-100, hem1-Δ100, hem15::Kanr). The MHY100Δhem15 strain was generated by using PCR-mediated gene disruption as described previously (36.Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligonucleotides (sequences available upon request) containing the desired nucleotide sequence of the HEM15 gene and the pRS400 plasmid were used to amplify the kanr gene by PCR. The resulting PCR products were transformed into the strain MHY100 and selected on plates containing G418 as described (36.Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). Yeast colonies were picked and verified. Yeast cells with the HEM15 gene deleted were confirmed by PCR analysis of the disrupted HEM15 gene and by complementation. The whole Hem15 coding sequences in the strain were deleted. The reporters used were the UAS1/CYC1-TATA-lacZ reporter described previously (28.Zhang L. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 37.Guarente L. Lalonde B. Gifford P. Alani E. Cell. 1984; 36: 503-511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 38.Turcotte B. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 39.Zhang L. Guarente L. Genetics. 1994; 136: 813-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the HAP1-lacZ reporter. The HAP1-lacZ reporter was constructed by inserting a DNA fragment containing the full promoter (from -470 to -1) of the HAP1 gene (see db.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/SGD/locus.pl?locus=YLR256W) in front of the start codon of the lacZ gene in the previously described reporter plasmid pLG178 (37.Guarente L. Lalonde B. Gifford P. Alani E. Cell. 1984; 36: 503-511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Growth Media and Conditions—Yeast strains were grown in SSGTEA, a semi-synthetic galactose medium (containing per liter, 3 g of Bactoyeast extract, 10 g of galactose, 0.8 g of NH4SO4, 1 g of KH2PO4, 0.5 g of NaCl, 0.7 g of MgSO4·7 H2O, 5 g of FeCl2, and 0.4 g of CaCl2), supplemented with 0.1% Tween 80 (v/v); 20 g/ml ergosterol; and 350 ppm Dow Corning FG-10 Silicone antifoam. To obtain a more uniform dispersion, the Tween 80, ergosterol, and silicon antifoam were sonicated in solution (∼110 watts for 1 min using a Branson model 250 Sonifier) prior to autoclaving. The galactose was autoclaved separately and added to the media under sterile conditions. Nutritional supplements (e.g. amino acids (40 mg/liter), CaCl2 (400 mg/liter)) were added from sterile stock solutions, as required to satisfy the requirements of each strain. For BWG1-7a cultures, yeast nitrogen base with an amino acid mixture was used instead of yeast extract and amino acid supplements. Cell growth was followed by measuring turbidity with a Klett-Summerson colorimeter fitted with a 54 green filter. Control of Oxygen Tension—For regulated growth in different oxygen concentrations, cells were grown in either a New Brunswick BioFloIIc or BioFloIII fermentor equipped with a gas-flow train that allows cells to be cultured under specific oxygen concentrations and to be shifted between oxygen concentrations by controlling the gas flow through the cultivation vessel (40.Burke P.V. Kwast K.E. Everts F. Poyton R.O. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fermentor was set up to maintain a pH of 5.0, a temperature of 28 °C, and an agitation rate of 200 rpm. A vessel with a working volume of 3.5-5.0 liters was used. The fermentor vessel was sparged with air for aerobic cultures, 2.5% CO2 in O2-free N2 for anoxic cultures, and gas mixtures that contain different percentages of oxygen in O2-free nitrogen for intermediate oxygen concentrations. Any residual oxygen in the 2.5% CO2 in O2-free N2 was removed by passage through an Oxyclear O2 absorber (Lab-Clear, Oakland, CA). Gas flow rates were maintained at 4 liters/min. The dissolved oxygen concentration in the fermentor was monitored continuously with an oxygen electrode and dissolved oxygen meter and maintained at the desired oxygen level via the automatic mixing of air or an O2/N2 mix with an O2-free 97.5% N2, 2.5% CO2 gas mix as needed. The oxygen electrode was calibrated with air (100% saturation) or O2-free nitrogen (0% saturation), and actual dissolved oxygen concentration (μm) in the gas-saturated growth media was calculated from the measured dissolved oxygen level and based upon the oxygen solubility in the growth media at 28 °C, the ambient barometric pressure, and the pressure within the vessel as described (40.Burke P.V. Kwast K.E. Everts F. Poyton R.O. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anoxic cells were grown in the dark to prevent photo-inhibition of growth. For shift experiments between normoxia and anoxia, cells were grown in the fermentor vessel in air to a cell density of ∼2 × 107 cells/ml, and then the gas was changed from air to 2.5% CO2 in O2-free N2. For shifts from anoxia to normoxia, cells were grown under anoxic conditions (2.5% CO2 in O2-free N2) for at least 6 generations (cell density ∼2 × 107 cells/ml) and then the sparge gas was changed to air. For steady state cultures, cells were harvested during mid-exponential phase, and for shift cultures they were harvested at the time points of interest (0, 5, 10, and 30 min and 1, 3, and 5 h after shift). At harvest, cells were quick-chilled to 4 °C by passage through a cooling coil/salted ice bath into chilled centrifuge bottles. They were collected by centrifugation (3,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), washed twice with ice-cold distilled water, and either processed immediately or flash-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C. For cells that were used for RNA isolation and analysis, diethylpyrocarbonate was added to the distilled water that was used in the washing steps. For some experiments, cells were grown under hypoxic or anoxic conditions in an anoxic/hypoxic chamber (Coy Laboratory, Inc.). Anoxic (less than 1 ppb) growth conditions were created by filling the chamber with a mixture of 5% H2 and 95% N2 in the presence of palladium catalyst. Hypoxic (about 1 ppm) growth conditions were created by filling the chamber with nitrogen gas alone. Oxygen-controlled promoter activities including those of UAS1/CYC1, ANB1, and Mga2-activated OLE1 (18.Jiang Y. Vasconcelles M.J. Wretzel S. Light A. Martin C.E. Goldberg M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6161-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 37.Guarente L. Lalonde B. Gifford P. Alani E.

Biol. 1988; 8: 4651-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) were measured under these growth conditions and responded to oxygen levels as expected. Manipulation of Heme Biosynthetic Pathway—Intracellular heme concentrations are controlled by deleting one or more of the genes encoding heme biosynthetic enzymes (Fig. 1) (42.Volland C. Felix F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 43.Haldi M. Guarente L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17107-17112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and adding back heme precursors or analogues (39.Zhang L. Guarente L. Genetics. 1994; 136: 813-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Hach A. Hon T. Zhang L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4324-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 45.Hon T. Hach A. Tamalis D.

In Δhem1 cells, a low heme concentration, at which wild-type Hap1 remains inactive in wild-type cells, is created by addition of 2 μg/ml of the heme precursor, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) (39.Zhang L. Guarente L. Genetics. 1994; 136: 813-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Hach A. Hon T. Zhang L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4324-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 45.Hon T. Hach A.

Higher heme concentrations for heme induction are achieved by addition of various amounts of deuteroporphyrin IX (dpIX) (25.Zhang L. Hach A. Cell. Mol.

Heme Extraction and Analysis—Cell pellets were resuspended in saline solution (∼1 ml/mg wet weight), and the cell mixtures were sonicated for 6 s with a tip sonicator (setting 2-3). An aliquot (0.3-0.4 ml) of each mixture was extracted by adding an equal volume of acetone/concentrated HCl/Me2SO (20:1:4). After vigorous vortexing the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rpm. The resulting supernatant was diluted with high pressure liquid chromatography mobile phase buffer and analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography. Intracellular levels of coproporphyrin and protoporphyrin were determined as described (50.Sinclair P.R. Gorman N. Jacobs J.M. Sipes I.G. Current Protocols in Toxicology. Vol. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000: 8.3.1-8.3.7Google Scholar). Protein concentrations in the samples used for heme extraction were determined (51.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on aliquots of cell extracts that were prepared by breaking cells with a Braun homogenizer (2 times with 45-s bursts). β-Galactosidase Assays—To determine the β-galactosidase levels from the UAS1/CYC1-TATA-lacZ or HAP1-lacZ reporter gene at various concentrations of ALA or dpIX or oxygen, cells were grown in synthetic complete medium containing 2% glucose and 2 μg/ml heme precursor, 5-aminolevulinic acid, under anoxic conditions. After cells reached an optical density (600 nm) of 1.0, they were incubated with 2-250 μg/ml 5-aminolevulinic acid or 50 ng/ml to 4 μg/ml of dpIX or defined concentrations of oxygen for 7 h and collected and subjected to chloroform permeabilization β-galactosidase assays (in Miller units), as described previously (45.Hon T.

For cells grown in the presence of various concentrations of heme, reporter activities were measured by preparing protein extracts from cells. Briefly, 108 yeast cells were collected, washed extensively, and resuspended in 250 μl of buffer containing 100 mm Tris, pH 8, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Glass beads (0.45-0.5 mm) were added to fill the liquid to the meniscus. Extracts were prepared by vortexing at top speed, 6 times for 15 s. Cell extracts were collected and cleared by centrifugation. Subsequently, protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assays. β-Galactosidase levels in extracts were measured in the same way as the one used to measure the activity in permeabilized cells (45.Hon T.

RNA Isolation and Hybridization—Total RNA was isolated as described previously (53.Elder R.T. Loh E.Y. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2432-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The RNA samples (30 μg) were denatured and separated on 1.5% agarose gels containing MOPS/formaldehyde buffer (20 mm MOPS, 40 mm sodium acetate, 8 mm EDTA, and 220 mm formaldehyde) (54.Tsang S.S. Yin X. Guzzo-Arkuran C. Jones V.S. Davison A.J. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 380-381PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA was transferred to Nytran Plus membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and hybridized. DNA probes were prepared by random-primer labeling of double-stranded DNA fragments using [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (55.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Various chemical species can be generated by single, double, or triple phosphorylations at the inositol hydroxy groups at positions 3, 4, and 5. Their synthesis and cellular concentrations are regulated by specific lipid kinases and phosphatases. One of the major mechanisms by which PIs regulate cellular processes is by their capacity to serve as membrane signals to affect intracellular localizations of effector proteins. A number of PI-binding motifs have now been characterized such as the FYVE domain (2.Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol.

The PX domain was afterward recognized in a vast number of other proteins covering a wide palette of molecular functions: cell signaling pathways (phospholipases D, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), vesicular trafficking and yeast morphology (human sorting nexins; yeast Vps5p, Vps17p, Vam7p, and Mvp1p) and control of yeast budding and cell polarity (Bem1p and Bem3p). phosphatidylinositol phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate d-myo-phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate Phox homology Src homology sorting nexin isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside root mean square. The PX domain can be present alone or in combination with other functional domains (6.Xu Y. Seet L.F. Hanson B. Hong W. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 513-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Three broad subclasses of PX containing proteins can be distinguished. The first subclass contains small proteins that essentially consist of the PX domain (sorting nexin 3 (SNX3), SNX10, SNX12, SNX23, SNX24, SNX26, and yeast Grd19p). PX domains in the second subclass contain extra sequences, such as coiled-coil regions that are involved in complex formation with other partners (SNX1, SNX2, Pps5, SNX4, SNX5, and SNX6). The third subclass encompasses PX proteins that contain additional well characterized domains: SH3 motifs are present in SNX9, SNX18, SNX28, p40phox, p47phox, FISH, Bem1p and Scd2p, but many more domain combinations exist (for a recent review see Ref. 7.Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 919-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Sorting nexins are found in a variety of organisms as regulators of cellular protein trafficking that have the presence of the PX domain in common (7.Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

The dynamic vessel transport processes at the late Golgi compartment of yeast (trans-Golgi network) require dedicated mechanisms for correct localization of resident membrane proteins. Recently a new gene, GRD19, was identified to be involved in the localization of late Golgi membrane proteins. It was concluded that Grd19p is a component of the retrieval machinery that functions by direct interaction with the cytosolic tails of certain TGN membrane proteins during the sorting/budding process at the prevacuolar compartment (10.Voos W. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The mammalian orthologue of Grd19p, SNX3, was shown to associate with early endosomes through a PX domain-mediated interaction with phosphatidylinosytol-3-phosphate (11.Xu Y. Hortsman H. Seet L. Wong S.H. Hong W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 658-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Overexpression of this protein alters/delays transport to the lysosome. The phosphoinositode binding of all yeast PX domains was recently experimentally analyzed, and they all bind PtdIns(3)P with high affinity. The glutathione S-transferase SNX3/Grd19p fusion protein in particular was shown to bind with an apparent Kd between 0.15 and 0.5 μm (12.Yu J.W. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44179-44184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Structures of a few PX domains have now been determined by crystallography and NMR in solution. The overall structure of the PX domain, as observed in p40phox, p47phox and Vam7p, is a three-stranded β-sheet followed by three helices (13.Bravo J. Karathanassis D. Pacold C.M. Pacold M.E.

It was shown by NMR that the Vam7p PX domain binds specifically to PtdIns(3)P through conserved positive residues and that this binding induces conformational changes in the protein (17.Cheever M.L.

We present here the structure of Grd19p, the first of an intact PX domain protein, free and in complex with a soluble diC4PtdIns(3)P compound. Our results allow us to answer the pending question on how the structure of a PX domain adapts to PtdIns(3)P binding. The overall structure is analogous to those determined for other PX domains. The ligand induces some conformational changes in the loops surrounding the lipid-binding site. Cloning and Purification—The YOR357c open reading frame DNA was amplified by PCR using oligodeoxynucleotides synthesized by MWG-Biotech and cloned between the NdeI and NotI sites of pET29 vector from Novagen. The expression strain BL21(DE3) pLysS was obtained from Novagen. 2xYT medium was purchased from BIO 101, Inc. and isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) from Sigma. BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells transformed with the construct were grown at 37 °C up to an A600 nm of 1. Expression was induced with 0.3 mm IPTG, and the cells were grown for a further 4 h at the same temperature. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) at 4 °C. Cells were lysed by 3 cycles of freeze/thawing and 30 seconds of sonication and were then centrifuged. The His-tagged proteins were purified using a Ni2+ affinity column (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid, Qiagen Inc.) and standard protocols. Eluted protein was further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex™ 75 (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated against a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The purity of the pooled fractions was checked by SDS-PAGE and the integrity of the protein samples by mass spectrometry. Se-Met-labeled proteins were prepared as follows. Transformed cells were grown in M63 medium at 37 °C up to an A600 nm of 1. The culture was then complemented with a mixture of amino acids (L-Lys, L-Phe, and L-Thr at 100 mg/l; L-Ile, L-Leu, L-Val and L-Se-Met at 50 mg/l) during 30 min, and the recombinant protein was overexpressed by addition of 0.3 mm IPTG during 4 h. The protein was purified as described before. Seleno-methionine incorporation into the protein was >95% as assayed by mass spectrometry. Crystallization and Data Collection—The protein (concentrated at 3 mg/ml) was crystallized at 293 K by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method using the sparce matrix crystallization screening kits from Hampton Research (18.Jancarik J. Kim S.-H. J. Appl. Cryst. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). Crystals of the native protein were grown from 1:1 drops of protein and 16% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m Na-HEPES, pH 7.5 (reservoir solution). Rod-shaped crystals of a maximum size of 200 micron appeared within 1 week. Hexagonal-shaped crystals from the Se-Met-labeled protein were grown under similar conditions. Crystals of the complex were obtained by mixing 1 μl of complex solution (protein at 7 mg/ml with 2 mm diC4PtdIns(3)P in 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7) with 1 μl of 10% polyethylene glycol 8000, 8% ethylene glycol, 0.1 m Hepes, pH7.5 (reservoir solution). X-ray data were collected from cryo-cooled crystals using mother liquor containing 30% glycerol as a cryoprotectant for the apo-protein and 30% ethylene glycol for the complex. Native and multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction data on Se-Met-substituted crystals were collected at beam line BM30A of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Crystals of the apo-protein belong to space group P6122 and have one molecule in the asymmetric unit (solvent content is 44%, see Ref. 19.Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7927) Google Scholar). Crystals of the complex belong to space group P1 with two molecules per asymmetric unit (solvent content = 54%). Diffraction data were processed using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (20.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

Rfree was calculated with a small fraction (4.8%) of randomly selected reflections. Open table in a new tab Structure Determination—Resolution of the crystal structure of Grd19p was performed by the multiple anomalous diffraction method on Se-Met-labeled protein crystals (Table I). The position of four Se atoms could be located and the structure was phased with the program SOLVE, using the data to 3.5 Å resolution (21.Terwilliger T.C. Acta Cryst. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). Solvent flattening using RESOLVE brought the overall figure-of-merit from 0.55 to 0.74. The phases were subsequently extended to 2.3 Å with RESOLVE. The resulting map allowed us to place 63% of the residues automatically (22.Terwilliger T.C. Acta Cryst. D. 2003; 59: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These starting phases were used for the automatic procedure of model building and refinement implemented in warpNtrace, against the native 2 Å resolution data (23.Perrakis A. Morris R.J. Lamzin V.S. Nature Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). The ARP model was completed and manually adjusted with the program turbo-FRODO (afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/TURBO_FRODO/turbo.html). Refinement was performed using the native data set up to 2.03 Å resolution following standards protocols as implemented in the program REFMAC (24.Murshudov G. Vagin A. Dodson E. Acta Cryst. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). All refinement statistics can be found in Table I. The current model includes residues 29–162 and 69 water molecules. No electron density was detected for the 28 N-terminal residues. Mass spectrometric analysis of a dissolved crystal indicated that it contained partially proteolyzed protein (the majority of the crystal sample missed the 28 N-terminal residues; data not shown). The final model has all residues in allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot and 93.2% in the most favorable regions according to the program PROCHECK (25.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The structure of the Grd19p in complex with diC4PtdIns(3)P was solved by molecular replacement with the apo-protein structure as search model and using the CNS package (Rfactor 39.2%, and Rfree-factor 37.7%) (26.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The cross-validated, sigma-A weighted map calculated from this model showed very clearly the presence of the diC4PtdIns(3)P ligand in the binding site. The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession number 1OCS for the native and 1OCU for the complex). Overall Structure of Grd19p—The structure of Grd19p, the first for an intact PX domain protein, was solved by multiple anomalous diffraction using Se-Met-substituted crystals at a resolution of 2.0 Å. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of Grd19p reveals a well identified PX domain (residues 30–162, Fig. 1), but the twenty-nine N-terminal residues have no sequence similarity with other motifs or with any other PX protein. In both Grd19p crystal structures (with and without ligand), clear electron density was only observed for the PX domain from residue Tyr-29. Mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE analysis of a dissolved crystal showed that protein sample present in the crystal was partially proteolysed at this position. The most likely hypothesis is that the N-terminal region of Grd19p is unstructured and hence susceptible to proteolysis. It is not known whether this region is important for function. The Grd19p PX domain has the overall structure as observed for other PX domains: a fairly flat molecule consisting of a three-stranded anti-parallel meander β-sheet, β1 (residues 36–47), β2 (56–67), and β3 (74–81) at the N-terminal part and a four helical bundle at the C-terminal part (α1 (83–99), α2 (122–139), α3 (142–147), and α4 (149–157)). Fig. 2A shows the superposition of the structure of the Grd19p-PX domain to those of the PX domains from p40phox, p47phox, and Vam7p (13.Bravo J. Karathanassis D. Pacold C.M. Pacold M.E. Ellson C.D.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5057-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The sequence similarity between these PX domains is rather low (only 11 strictly conserved residues between Grd19p and p40phox, Fig. 1) explaining the rather high mutual RMS deviations between the superposed structures: p47phox (RMS: 1.5 Å for 86 Cα positions), p40phox (RMS: 2.2 Å for 117 Cα positions), and Vam7p (RMS: 2.1 Å for 86 Cα positions). The structured core is very well conserved, and the most pronounced differences are observed in the loop connections that are of unequal length between the various PX domains. Especially the poly-proline loop (containing residues 100–116 in Grd19p) whose C-terminal end comes close to the PtdIns(3)P-binding site adopts very different conformations in the various PX domains (Fig. 2A). This could be related to different functions of these loops in the various proteins. Because it is rich in exposed hydrophobic residues, the C-terminal part of this loop has been coined the membrane attachment site. In the case of p47phox this loop is documented to interact with a SH3 domain within the same protein. PX domains of the SNXs represent a distinct subgroup of the PX superfamily and may have evolved independently from other PX domains (27.Teasdale R.D. Loci D. Houghton F. Karlsson L. Gleeson P.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Our structure of the Grd19p-PX shows that the various branches of the PX superfamily probably all share a common scaffold, despite the fact that they cannot be retrieved by mutual BLAST searches.Fig. 2Overall comparison between PX domain structures.A, ribbon presentation of the superposition between Grd19p-PX (yellow) and the other available PX domain structures. p47phox PX is in blue (16.Karathanassis D.

Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44179-44184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We therefore used the soluble diC4PtdIns(3)P compound in our co-crystallization trials. Because the lipid-binding site in the crystal of the Grdp19p-PX apo form is blocked through interaction with a symmetry related molecule, crystals of the complex were obtained by co-crystallization of the protein with diC4PtdIns(3)P. The complex crystallized with two molecules in the asymmetric unit and in a different space group from the apo-protein (Table I). Gel filtration of the purified protein showed that it elutes as a monomer in absence of ligand (the apo-protein structure has one molecule bound in the asymmetric unit). We suppose that dimerization in the presence of the ligand is probably induced by the crystallization conditions. The structure of the complex could be solved in a straightforward way by molecular replacement using the structure of the apo-protein at a resolution of 4 Å and the structure was refined against 2.3 Å data (refinement statistics are in Table I). The structures of both molecules in the asymmetric unit are identical (RMS of 0.47Å for all Cα positions), but with one noticeable difference in the lipid-binding site. During refinement of the protein the residual electron density revealed very clearly the presence of the bound PtdIns(3)P head group in the two Grd19p copies of the asymmetric unit (Fig. 3A). The phosphate head group has well defined electron density in both molecules of the asymmetric unit, but only some guesses can be made on the positions of the hydrophobic tails. The interactions of the ligand with Grd19p also are very similar in both copies of the molecule. The ligand refined with B factors comparable with those from the surrounding protein residues. The structures of Grd19p with and without ligand represent the first case where both forms of the same PX domain could be structurally characterized and offers the possibility to evaluate conformational changes induced by ligand binding. The overall structures of the ligand-bound and free Grd19p are very similar (Fig. 2B). Superposition of both structures yields a RMS of 0.58 Å for 120 Cα positions. The core region that provides the majority of specific interactions to the diC4PtdIns(3)P is identical in both structures. Two regions, however, adopt different conformations in apo and complexed Grd19p: the loop connecting β1 to β2, comprising amino acids 45–53, and the region connecting α1 and α2 (residues 111–117). The first region, situated close to the diC4PtdIns(3)P-binding site, is involved in dimer formation. The second region, which adopts a different conformation, provides one rim of the ligand-binding site. This region is situated at the exit of the hydrophobic moiety of the ligand. In the complex, the peptide is moving in toward the bound diC4PtdIns(3)P, and some residues are changing conformation (illustrated in Fig. 4A). Probably the key factor in this change is the 3.5 Å movement of Lys-112, approaching its Nz position toward a non-bridging oxygen of the 1-phosphate group of the bound ligand (Figs. 3B and 4A). The electron density for residues 114 and 115 is unclear in both copies of the asymmetric unit, suggesting mobility. These residues have well defined electron density in the structure of the apo form, where they form part of a region that is involved in crystal packing. In the complex the loop has no neighboring contacts. The bottom of the binding pocket and the protein regions in contact with the specificity-determining 3-phosphate group are not undergoing any conformational changes upon ligand binding. The phosphoinositide head group binds in a pocket contained between the N-terminal regions of helix α1, strand β2, the poly-proline loop, and the N-terminal part of helix α2 (Fig. 3B). Prominent interactions are formed between the 3-phosphate, 1-phosphate, and 4/5-hydroxyl groups of the ligand and well conserved residues in the binding pocket (Fig. 3C). The bottom of the pocket is occupied by a few well ordered water molecules. The well conserved Arg-81 provides the main specific interaction with the 3-phosphate group of the bound diC4PtdIns(3)P: its NH2 group is at hydrogen bond distance from the 3-phosphate oxygen. In other PX domains, this residue was shown to be critical in ligand binding and endosomal localization in vivo, and a basic residue is found in all PX domains that bind 3-phosphoinositides (11.Xu Y. Hortsman H. Seet L. Wong S.H. Hong W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 658-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 13.Bravo J. Karathanassis D. Pacold C.M. Pacold M.E. Ellson C.D. Anderson K.E. Butler P.J. Lavenir I. Perisic O. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The 3-phosphate group is further stabilized by a hydrogen bond with the Ser-83 side chain OH group. Serine is present at this position in 70% of the yeast PX domain sequences, or is replaced by residues with analogous H-bonding possibilities. It is totally conserved in the SNX3 family members (Fig. 1). The conformations of the side chains interacting with the ligand are very similar for the two molecules of the asymmetric unit, except for Arg-118. In the B molecule Arg-118 forms a second salt bridge with the 3-phosphate group, but in the A molecule its side chain is pointing away from it (not shown). Superposition of the PtdIns(3)P-bound complex of the p40phox PX domain with the Grd19p complex demonstrates that the ligands bind in very similar orientations and that their binding is stabilized by similar interactions (Fig. 4B) (13.Bravo J. Karathanassis D. Pacold C.M. Pacold M.E. Ellson C.D. Anderson K.E. Butler P.J. Lavenir I. Perisic O. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Superposition of the x-ray structure of the p47phox domain with bound sulfate ions and the Grd19p complex, shows that the sulfate ion occupies exactly the same position as the 3-phosphate group of the diC4PtdIns(3)P ligand in Grd19p. Taken together these results suggest that PtdIns(3)P-specific PX domains are interacting in very similar ways with their phosphatidylinositol-ligands. Filter binding assays showed that Grd19p is very specific for the phosphate at the 3-OH position: no significant binding could be observed for any other combination of phosphate positions on the PtdIns head (4 or 5 position alone or in combination with the 3 position) (12.Yu J.W. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44179-44184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Modeling suggests that a phosphate on the 5-OH position would create a steric clash with the main chain of residues 112 and 113 and with the side chain of Arg-127. The weak binding of compounds with phosphates on the 4 position is more difficult to rationalize. A torsional reorientation of the side chain of Arg-118 would be sufficient to accommodate the phosphate group at the 4 position, a conformation that is in fact observed in one of the two Grd19p molecules in the asymmetric unit. A 4-phosphate group could even engage in a favorable interaction with Arg-127. Bravo et al. suggest that the environment around the 4-OH group is too crowded to accommodate an extra phosphate (13.Bravo J. Karathanassis D. Pacold C.M. Pacold M.E. Ellson C.D. Anderson K.E. Butler P.J. Lavenir I. Perisic O. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). PX domains that show affinity for PtdIns(4)P compounds however all have equivalent residues around the 4-OH position. There probably exist subtle adjustments to optimize binding of appropriate PX domains to these compounds. The 1-phosphate group is very close to the Nz atom of the Lys-112 side chain, which is further stabilized by a salt bridge with Glu-86. Lys-112 is conserved in all SNX3 family PX domains (Fig. 1). Not only the 3-phosphate group but also the inositol hydroxyl groups are engaged in specific interactions with the protein. The 4- and 5-OH groups form hydrogen bonds with the NH1 and NH2 of Arg-127 (Fig. 3C). Mutation of the equivalent Arg-105 in the p40phox PX and Arg-90 in the p47phox PX domains abolishes binding (28.Kanai F. Liu H. Field S.J. Akbary H. Matsuo T. Brown G.E. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), and mutation of an equivalent residue eliminates endosomal localization in cytokine-independent survival kinase (29.Xu J. Liu D. Gill G. Songyang Z. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This arginine is conserved in almost all PX sequences. The inositol 2-OH group forms a charged hydrogen bond with the carboxylate group of Glu-86. A carboxylate group (Glu or Asp) is present in all the yeast PX sequences at this position suggesting that this interaction could be important for inositol recognition. The 2-OH group of the PtdIns(3)P bound to the p40phox PX domain does not form any hydrogen bonds. Grd19p-Glu-86 is replaced by His-63 in p40phox PX and this residue has its side chain turned away from the ligand. One face of the inositol ring rests on the hydrophobic part of the Tyr-82, a very well conserved residue in all yeast PX domains (Figs. 3C and 4A). This type of hydrophobic stacking is a frequently observed theme in binding sites of carbohydrates on proteins. The hydrophobic tail of the ligand is close to the mobile region of the proline-rich region loop, rich in hydrophobic residues (Ile-113, Leu-114, and Leu-115). The position and hydrophobic character of this loop suggests that this region could participate in interaction with the membrane lipid bilayer. Large chemical shifts were observed in this region upon binding of the Vam7p PX domain to micelles (17.Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Considerable sequence divergence and large insertions among the various PX sequences occur at this region. One non-bridging oxygen of the 1-phosphate group of the ligand is close to the side chain of Lys-112. The corresponding non-bridging oxygens of the ligand in the p40phox complex are stabilized by charge interactions with the basic residues Arg-60 (NH1) and Lys-92 (NZ) (the equivalent of the Grd19p-Lys112). Grd19p has Ser-83 at the equivalent position for p40phox-Arg-60, but its side chain is too far for interaction with the 1-phosphate group. Mutation of p40phox-Lys-92 greatly decreases affinity for PtdIns(3)P, and mutation of Arg-60 to Ala decreases affinity 3-fold (13.Bravo J. Karathanassis D. Pacold C.M. Pacold M.E. Ellson C.D. Anderson K.E. Butler P.J. Lavenir I. Perisic O. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies have indicated that Lys-92 is important for affinity but that the mutation of Arg-60 to Ala causes only a 3-fold loss (13.Bravo J. Karathanassis D. Pacold C.M. Pacold M.E. Ellson C.D. Anderson K.E. Butler P.J. Lavenir I. Perisic O. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the PX domain of the p47phox revealed the presence of two well bound sulfate ions in two distinct basic pockets (16.Karathanassis D. Stahelin R.V. Bravo J. Perisic O. Pacold C.M. Cho W. Williams R.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5057-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The first sulfate ion in the p47phox structure occupies an identical position to the 3-phosphate group in the Grd19p complex, and both groups are stabilized by analogous interactions with the protein. The second sulfate of the p47phox PX domain is bound at the irregular exit of the first helix and the start of the proline-rich region. p47phox provides a positively charged pocket that favorably interacts with the sulfate ion (His-51, Lys-55, Arg-70, and His-74). It was suggested and biochemically verified that this pocket provides a binding site for phospholipids with a small head group, such as phosphatidic acid, cooperatively binding with the PtdIns(3)P binding region. The corresponding region in Grd19p adopts a rather different structural conformation (not shown). Grd19p provides residues that could interact with an anion group of a phospholipid: His-108 occupies about the same position as His-74 in p47phox, and Arg-89 is superposable to His-51, however it has no equivalent residues for p47phox Arg-70 and Lys-55. In the resting state of p47phox, its PX domain is masked by an interaction with a SH3 domain within the same protein. This SH3 domain binds to the proline-rich region, and this interaction is regulated by the phosphorylation state of its C-terminal part (indicated in Fig. 2A). The proline-rich region is partially present in Grd19p (containing Pro-107 and Pro-110), but this protein is not documented to interact with SH3 domains. However, Grd19p is specifically involved in the retrieval of late Golgi membrane proteins, DPAP A and Kex2p, from the prevacuolar compartment (30.Nothwehr S.F. Roberts C.J. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 31.Wilcox C.A. Redding K. Wright R. Fuller R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1353-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Direct physical interaction was demonstrated between the cytosolic domain of DPAP A and Grd19p, but not with other PX-containing domains from yeast (10.Voos W. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The presence of a FXFXD retrieval motif in the membrane proteins contributed to the stability of the interaction. This motif consists of a cluster of basic amino acids and is followed by a few acidic residues (30.Nothwehr S.F. Roberts C.J. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 31.Wilcox C.A. Redding K. Wright R. Fuller R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1353-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The interaction depends on the presence of Mg2+ and is resistant to high salt concentrations. Nothing is known about the structural determinants of this interaction regarding Grd19p. In absence of further biochemical data it is difficult to speculate about potential membrane protein interaction sites on the surface of Grd19p. We are in the stage of characterizing these interactions using peptides derived from the tails of DPAP and Kex2p. This paper describes the first comparison between a PX protein in ligand-bound and free form. The overall structure of Grd19p is very similar to other PX domain structures, despite very low sequence similarity. The position of the diC4Ptd-Ins(3)P in the recognition site of Grd19p shows that the mode of interaction is very similar to what was observed for the complex of the p40phox PX domain. The Grd19p inositol-binding site undergoes small but significant structural changes upon ligand binding. The structure allows us now to go further into the characterization of the late Golgi membrane protein retrieval process through the study of interactions with peptides from the cytosolic regions and the functional characterization of surface mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1964428238,"Stanniocalcin (STC) is a large polypeptide hormone that is widely distributed in tissues such as kidney, adrenal, and ovary. In most tissues, STC exists as a 50-kDa homodimer (STC50). The ovaries produce a higher molecular weight variant (big STC) in androgen-producing theca cell and interstitial cell compartments. Luteal cells, which do not express the STC gene, nonetheless contain high levels of STC protein, suggesting they are targeted by and sequester big STC through a receptor-mediated process. Recently, an STC·alkaline phosphatase fusion protein was used to characterize mitochondrial targeting and sequestration of STC50 and its receptor in liver and kidney. The main objective of the present study was to characterize big STC and its receptor in mammalian ovary and determine whether the ovarian STC variant was similarly targeted to luteal cell mitochondria. By in situ ligand binding, we identified large numbers of STC receptors on corpus luteal cells. However, a more detailed analysis of sub-cellular fractions revealed that both STC and its receptor were not preferentially targeted to mitochondria but instead to cholesterol/lipid storage droplets, which was more indicative of a role in steroidogenesis. Functional studies revealed that additions of big STC had concentration-dependent inhibitory effects on both basal and stimulated progesterone output by primary cultured luteal cells. Furthermore, STC receptor levels were up-regulated in luteal cells in response to protein kinase A activation. Taken together, these findings indicate that theca cell-derived big STC is targeted to the cholesterol/lipid storage droplets of luteal cells to regulate steroidogenesis. This constitutes the first reported description of polypeptide hormone and receptor targeting to cholesterol/lipid droplets and the first biological role for the big STC variant.

In most tissues, STC exists as a 50-kDa homodimer known as STC50. This form of the hormone has a unique signaling pathway whereby it is heavily sequestered by its target cells. In liver and kidney, for instance, STC50 is first sequestered by target cells and then traffics to their mitochondria where it increases the rate of electron transport. Because STC receptors are present on both the plasma membranes and the mitochondria of target cells, the whole process appears to be receptor-mediated.By far the highest levels of STC gene expression are observed in the ovary (1.Varghese R. Wong C.K. Deol H. Wagner G.F. DiMattia G.E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4714-4725Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), where the transcript is confined to theca and interstitial cells (TIC). Interestingly, STC protein is found not only in TICs but also in oocytes and cells of the corpus luteum (1.Varghese R. Wong C.K. Deol H. Wagner G.F. DiMattia G.E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4714-4725Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), suggesting that the STC is produced by TICs for targeting to oocytes and luteal cells. The fact that the protein is readily detectable in cells that do not make the hormone further suggests that, as in the case of STC50 signaling in liver and kidney (2.McCudden C.R. James K.A. Hasilo C. Wagner G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45249-45258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), ovarian STC is also sequestered by its target cells. An important question here is whether or not ovarian STC undergoes the same mitochondrial targeting as observed in liver and kidney. Central to this question is the recent discovery that ovarian STC is structurally different from the 50-kDa homodimer found in most other tissues. Big STC, as we have named the ovarian STC variant, consists of three higher molecular mass species of 84, 112, and 135 kDa, that appear to be oligomeric complexes of a larger STC monomer (3.Paciga M. Watson A.J. DiMattia G.E. Wagner G.F. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3925-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).The ability of luteal cells to sequester STC to an extent readily detectable by immunocytochemistry (1.Varghese R. Wong C.K. Deol H. Wagner G.F. DiMattia G.E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4714-4725Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 4.Deol H.K. Varghese R. Wagner G.F. Dimattia G.E. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3412-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) implies the presence of STC receptors and/or binding proteins in these cells. In this regard, we recently used an STC·alkaline phosphatase (AP) fusion protein (STC·AP) to characterize receptors and delineate the mitochondrial targeting of STC50 in liver and kidney (2.McCudden C.R. James K.A. Hasilo C. Wagner G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45249-45258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The objective of this study, therefore, was to use the same methodology to characterize STC receptors in ovarian luteal cells and thereby address the question as to whether or not big STC is similarly targeted. Our findings have revealed that, in addition to being structurally unique, big STC has a novel trafficking pathway in regulating luteal cell function. As a result, we have uncovered a novel targeting pathway for polypeptide hormones.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Bovine serum albumin, forskolin, and 1,9-dideoxyforskolin were obtained from Sigma. Collagenase type II and Medium 199 were purchased from Invitrogen. DNase type I was procured from Roche Applied Science, and UltraCulture media were obtained from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Rabbit anti-progesterone anti-serum was a gift from Dr. T. G. Kennedy (University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario).Hormone Purification—Big STC was purified from conditioned media by immunoaffinity column chromatography. This entailed the preparation of an STC immunoaffinity column by coupling the IgG fraction from a polyclonal human STC antiserum to CNBr-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (5.Wagner G.F. Milliken C. Friesen H.G. Copp D.H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 79: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Conditioned media (24 h) from HT1080 cells, a human fibrosarcoma cell line that secretes big STC (3.Paciga M. Watson A.J. DiMattia G.E. Wagner G.F. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3925-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), was then recycled through the column overnight. Bound big STC was eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 3, containing 0.5 m sodium chloride. The elution profile was monitored by RIA for STC content. The relevant fractions were pooled, concentrated, and buffer-exchanged on a Centricon YM-10 centrifugal filter device (Millipore). The STC content of the concentrate was then quantified by RIA prior to use.Bovine Luteal Cell Cultures—Bovine ovaries were obtained from a local abattoir. The corpora lutea were removed and washed several times in Hank's balanced salt solution containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. An enriched/highly pure population of dispersed bovine luteal cells (BLCs) was obtained by mincing the isolated corpus luteum and subsequently digesting the tissue in an enzymatic mixture of collagenase type II and DNase I as described previously (6.Simmons K.R. Caffrey J.L. Phillips J.L. Abel Jr., J.H. Niswender G.D. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1976; 152: 366-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 7.Hixon J.E. Hansel W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1979; 112: 613-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Bovine luteal cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Cells were seeded at a density of 500,000 cells/ml in 24-well tissue culture plates and maintained at 37 °C in UltraCulture media supplemented with an antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Invitrogen). The proportion of steroidogenic BLCs obtained was monitored by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD) enzyme histochemistry as described previously (8.Hild-Petito S.A. Shiigi S.M. Stouffer R.L. Biol. Reprod. 1989; 40: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The ability of the luteal cells to respond to hormone stimulation was assessed by measuring the accumulation of progesterone in the culture medium in response to luteinizing hormone (LH).Western Blot Analysis—Intracellular luteal cell protein and conditioned cell culture media were obtained as described previously (3.Paciga M. Watson A.J. DiMattia G.E. Wagner G.F. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3925-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were standardized using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Roche Applied Science) and incubated with polyclonal hSTC antiserum (1:40,000) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1:50,000; Amersham Biosciences) and subsequently developed with an ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences).Receptor Binding Assays/Receptor Localization—In situ ligand binding and receptor binding assays were performed on whole luteal cells and purified plasma membranes as described previously using an STC·AP fusion protein (2.McCudden C.R. James K.A. Hasilo C. Wagner G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45249-45258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Receptor binding studies were also performed on cholesterol/lipid storage droplet (CLD) isolates from bovine corpus luteum (9.Servetnick D.A. Brasaemle D.L. Gruia-Gray J. Kimmel A.R. Wolff J. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16970-16973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These assays were conducted as described previously for plasma membranes, except that tubes were periodically vortexed to prevent the separation of aqueous and non-aqueous phases. Following centrifugation, free and CLD-bound STC·AP fusion proteins were separated by aspiration of the infranatant with a 23-gauge needle. AP assay buffer was then added to the remaining supernatant containing the CLD fraction, and AP activity was detected as described previously (2.McCudden C.R. James K.A. Hasilo C. Wagner G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45249-45258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).Radioimmunoassay—Sub-cellular fractions of the bovine corpus luteum and conditioned media collected from cultured luteal cells were analyzed by RIA as described previously (3.Paciga M. Watson A.J. DiMattia G.E. Wagner G.F. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3925-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Immunohistochemistry—Double-label immunofluorescence microscopy was used to co-localize STC and perilipin in sections of mouse ovaries. Ovaries were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and sectioned as described previously (10.Stasko S.E. Wagner G.F. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 220: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Sections were then co-incubated with rabbit anti-STC (1:1000) and goat anti-perilipin (1:1000) anti-serum overnight. Donkey anti-rabbit rhodamine-IgG and mouse anti-goat fluorescein isothiocyanate-IgG were used to visualize the STC and perilipin antisera using a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 laser scanning system).RESULTSSTC Receptor Localization in the Ovary—Specific STC receptors and/or binding sites were successfully localized histologically in tissue sections of adult mouse ovary using the STP·AP fusion protein. Fig. 1, A and B show that the strongest STP·AP binding was evident in the oocytes of primary and secondary follicles and in a sub-population of cells in the corpus luteum, as indicated by the deep purple color. The staining in luteal cells was noticeably punctate in appearance, whereas that in oocytes was homogenous by comparison. In both cell types the majority of staining was cytoplasmic in nature with no evidence of there being nuclear-associated receptors. By comparison, there were few if any STC receptors evident in the theca cells surrounding each follicle or in the ovarian stroma (Fig. 1C). STC receptors were also not evident in granulosa cells or the oocytes of large pre-ovulatory follicles. Similar results were observed in bovine and rat ovary (not shown).STC Receptor Localization in Cultured Luteal Cells—In view of the strong STP·AP fusion protein binding to luteal cells in tissue sections, in situ ligand binding was also conducted on isolated luteal cells following acetone fixation. We used well established techniques to isolate highly pure and functional BLCs (6.Simmons K.R. Caffrey J.L. Phillips J.L. Abel Jr., J.H. Niswender G.D. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1976; 152: 366-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 7.Hixon J.E. Hansel W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1979; 112: 613-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Routinely, >85% of the cells were steroidogenically active as indicated by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme biochemistry, and their progesterone output was significantly enhanced in response to hCG stimulation, indicating that they were fully functional cells (results not shown). As in the case of tissue sections, plated cells exhibited strong STP·AP binding, indicative of a high number of STC receptors. Furthermore, the staining in freshly isolated cells was also punctate in appearance (Fig. 1E), as seen with luteal cells in ovarian tissue sections.Receptor Binding Studies—Saturation binding studies on isolated luteal cells and their membranes yielded high affinity binding sites in both instances. Receptors on whole cells had an estimated Kd of 1.5 nm with a Bmax of 5 pmol/mg protein (Fig. 2A). This was similar to the Kd of 1.2 nm and a Bmax of 8 pmol/mg protein for isolated plasma membranes (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Saturation binding of STP·AP fusion protein to luteal cells and their sub-cellular fractions. Purified luteal cells (A), luteal cell plasma membranes (B), and lipid storage droplets (C) were incubated with increasing amounts of STP·AP, AP, or STP·AP + 1 μm hSTC at room temperature for 90 min. Analysis of the binding data yielded specific high affinity receptors for STC in all three preparations. STP·AP binding could be abolished with the addition of excess unlabelled recombinant hSTC (1 μm) but not with any other peptide hormones tested (1-10 μm STC-related protein, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)). The saturation curves shown are representative of three independent determinations (presented as mean ± S.E.; n = 3 per point).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The possibility that receptors might reside in a sub-cellular compartment was evident from the punctate staining obtained by in situ ligand binding. This notion was also based on our recent studies in liver and kidney in which large numbers of cellular STC receptors were revealed on both the plasma membranes and mitochondria (2.McCudden C.R. James K.A. Hasilo C. Wagner G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45249-45258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We therefore proceeded to examine this possibility in the ovary by determining the sub-cellular distribution of STC receptors in luteal cells. The results revealed that there was little binding activity in the nuclear and mitochondrial fractions from the corpus luteum, whereas significant binding activity was observed in the CLD fraction. Here, saturation binding studies revealed the presence of a high affinity receptor with an estimated Kd of 0.2 nm and a Bmax of 25 pmol/mg protein (Fig. 2C). In contrast to hSTC, competition binding studies with 10 μm follicle-stimulating protein (FSH), hCG, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), and STC-related protein (STCrP) produced no measurable displacement of STP·AP, thus demonstrating the specificity of STP·AP binding to the CLD fraction.Sub-Cellular Distribution of Ovarian STC—Because of the presence of significant binding activity on both plasma membranes and the CLD fraction, and because STC50 is known to be heavily sequestered by target cell mitochondria (2.McCudden C.R. James K.A. Hasilo C. Wagner G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45249-45258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we proceeded to examine the sub-cellular distribution of the ligand. As in the case of liver and kidney, some STC immunoreactivity was detected in the 10,000 × g mitochondrial fraction (∼7%; 3.3 ng of STC/mg of total mitochondrial protein). However, the majority of STC immunoreactivity resided in the cytoplasm (∼93%; 41.5 ng of STC/mg of protein), and none was detected in the nuclear (1000 × g) or plasma membrane fractions (100,000 × g). Further fractionation of the cytosol into aqueous and lipid components revealed that most intra-cellular STC (∼75%; 111.1 ng of STC/mg of CLD protein) was localized to the CLD fraction where we also observed significant receptor binding activity.Western blot analysis confirmed the RIA data on the luteal cell sub-cellular fractions by demonstrating that STC was only detectable in the CLD fraction. In contrast to previous studies (2.McCudden C.R. James K.A. Hasilo C. Wagner G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45249-45258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), STC was undetectable in luteal mitochondria and plasma membranes (400 μg of protein/lane; Fig. 3A), however a further sub-cellular fractionation revealed that STC was present in the CLD fraction. Furthermore, as in the case of theca cells, luteal cells only contained the higher molecular mass big STC variant (Fig. 3B). These findings then prompted us to determine whether this novel sub-cellular distribution was unique to luteal cells or was a feature of all ovarian steroidogenic cells. Interestingly, RIA analysis of sub-cellular fractions from purified bovine theca cells yielded similar results, revealing that big STC in theca cells was also preferentially confined to the CLD fraction (results not shown).Fig. 3Western blotting of bovine luteal cell protein.Panel A shows that, in contrast to the kidney and liver, the majority of STC remained in the luteal cell cytoplasm (100 μg total protein loaded on gel shown here) and none was detected in the mitochondria (400 μg total protein loaded on gel shown here) or the plasma membranes (400 μg total protein loaded on gel shown here). Subsequent fractionation of luteal cell extracts, shown in panel B, revealed high molecular mass big STC (84, 112, and 135 kDa) present in total bovine luteal cell extracts as well as in the proteins extracted from the lipid storage droplets of these cells. Proteins were resolved on a 10% acrylamide gel under non-reducing conditions. High molecular mass big STC (84, 112, and 135 kDa) was detected in total bovine luteal cell extracts (100 μg) as well as in the proteins extracted from the lipid storage droplets (100 μg) of these cells.

As shown in Fig. 4, most luteal cells that were immuno-positive for perilipin (Fig. 4B, green fluorescence) were also positive for STC (Fig. 4A, red fluorescence), resulting in a high degree of overlap (Fig. 4C, orange fluorescence). A similar pattern of STC and perilipin distribution was observed in follicles. As expected, a high degree of STC immunoreactivity was observed in theca cells and oocytes (Fig. 4D, red fluorescence). Those theca cells, which were STC immunopositive, also contained high levels of immunoreactive perilipin (Fig. 4E, green fluorescence), resulting in a high degree of overlap (Fig. 4F, orange fluorescence). There was no co-localization of STC and perilipin in oocytes, suggesting that here the ligand likely resides in a different sub-cellular compartment.Fig. 4STC ligand and perilipin co-localization in mouse ovary. To confirm our immunoblot and RIA results, double label immunofluorescence was carried out to determine whether STC co-localized with perilipin, which is known to localize to the cholesterol/lipid storage droplet membrane of steroidogenic cells. The same population of luteal cells that were immunopositive for STC (panel A, red fluorescence) was also immunopositive for perilipin (panel B, green fluorescence). Panel C shows the high degree of overlap (orange fluorescence) of the cells shown in panels A and B. When ovarian follicles were examined, STC immunoreactivity (D, red fluorescence) was seen in both TICs (arrow) and oocytes (O), whereas only TICs were perilipin-positive (panel E). Granulosa cells (G) were devoid of STC and perilipin. Panel F shows the overlap between STC and perilipin staining in panels D and E (orange fluorescence).

To this end we employed cultured BLCs and subjected them to treatment with ovarian steroids as well as various signal transduction pathway activators. As shown in Fig. 5, binding activity was consistently up-regulated significantly only in response to forskolin, an activatory of adenylate cyclase. Receptor levels were not affected by treatment with sex steroids relevant to the ovary (progesterone, estradiol-17β, and androstenedione; all tested at 0.01-10 μm), the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (0.01-10 μm), or hCG (100 ng/ml).Fig. 5Luteal cell STC receptor regulation. Cultured luteal cells were exposed to treatments as indicated for 24 h. Receptor binding assays were then performed as described under ”Experimental Procedures.” As shown in panel A, STC receptor levels in luteal cells were not affected by treatment with hCG (100 ng/ml), estradiol, dexamethasone, or androstenedione (10-6m). As shown in panel B, however, in response to forskolin, STC receptor levels consistently increased in stepwise fashion, whereas the forskolin analog, 1,9-dideoxyforskolin, had no effect.

Because progesterone is the primary steroid produced by luteal cells, and given the association of ovarian STC with the CLD, we elected to examine the effects of big STC on steroid output. As shown in Fig. 6A, progesterone secretion by cultured BLCs was reduced significantly in cultures treated with big STC as compared with controls (p < 0.01), suggesting that big STC has regulating effects on luteal cell progesterone secretion. This inhibitory effect of big STC on luteal cell progesterone secretion was attenuated with the addition of STC anti-serum (Fig. 6B). Moreover, big STC also inhibited hCG-stimulated progesterone (P4) release in addition to basal progesterone release (Fig. 6C). The addition of hCG alone (0.01-100 ng/ml) had concentration-dependent stimulating effects on progesterone output (∼40 ng/ml in control cultures to ∼150 ng/ml in maximally stimulated cells). The addition of big STC decreased basal progesterone secretion but, more importantly, inhibited hCG-stimulated progesterone secretion at all concentrations tested (0.01-100 ng/ml).Fig. 6Effect of big STC on luteal cell progesterone production.A, cultured luteal cells were incubated in UltraCulture media with or without immunopurified big STC for 24 h. The progesterone accumulation in the media was then assessed by RIA. B, STC caused a significant decrease in luteal cell progesterone secretion, an effect that could be abolished with STC antiserum in control and STC-treated cultures. C, luteal cells were also maintained in UltraCulture media containing increasing concentrations of hCG (0.01-100 ng/ml) with or without ovarian STC (0.3 nm) for 24 h. Progesterone accumulation in the culture media was then assessed by RIA. As expected, hCG dose-dependently stimulated progesterone release, which was then inhibited by STC. Each bar represents the mean of at least three replicates; asterisk (*) indicates p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have described obvious discordances in the patterns of STC mRNA and protein distribution in mammalian tissues. During kidney development, for instance, STC gene expression is confined to undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, whereas the STC protein is equally abundant in adjacent nephron cells undergoing terminal differentiation (11.Stasko S.E. Wagner G.F. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 171: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Similarly, in adult kidney the STC gene is uniquely expressed in collecting duct cells, whereas STC immunoreactivity is equally evident in other nephron segments. These findings have led us to formulate a sequestering hypothesis of STC action whereby STC is produced and released by one cell type and sequestered by adjacent target cells (12.Wong C.K. Ho M.A. Wagner G.F. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 158: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This hypothesis has now been proven in the case in the kidney, where it has been shown that collecting duct-derived STC50 is heavily sequestered by target cell mitochondria via a receptor-mediated process in order to stimulate electron transport (4.Deol H.K. Varghese R. Wagner G.F. Dimattia G.E. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3412-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).The sequestering phenomenon is not unique to kidney. Liver mitochondria contain equally high levels of both ligand and receptor and, more to the point, the same discordant pattern of mRNA and protein distribution has also been described in mammalian ovary. In both the mouse and the bovine ovary, the STC gene is solely expressed in TICs, whereas oocytes and corpus luteal cells contain equally high levels of the ligand (1.Varghese R. Wong C.K. Deol H. Wagner G.F. DiMattia G.E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4714-4725Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 3.Paciga M. Watson A.J. DiM"
https://openalex.org/W1978554064,"CLCA (chloride channel, calcium-activated) proteins are novel pulmonary vascular addresses for blood-borne, lung-metastatic cancer cells. They facilitate vascular arrest of cancer cells via adhesion to β4 integrin and promote early, intravascular, metastatic growth. Here we identify the interacting binding domains of endothelial CLCA proteins (e.g. hCLCA2, mCLCA5, mCLCA1, and bCLCA2) and β4 integrin. Endothelial CLCAs share a common β4-binding motif (β4BM) in their 90- and 35-kDa subunits of the sequence F(S/N)R(I/L/V)(S/T)S, which is located in the second extracellular domain of the 90-kDa CLCA and near the N terminus of the 35-kDa CLCA, respectively. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent, pull-down, and adhesion assays, we showed that glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins of β4BMs from the 90- and 35-kDa CLCA subunits bind to the β4 integrin in a metal ion-dependent manner. Fusion proteins from fibronectin and the integrins β1 and β3 served as negative controls. β4BM fusion proteins competitively blocked the β4/CLCA adhesion and prevented lung colonization of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. A disrupted β4BM in hCLCA1, which is not expressed in endothelia, failed to interact with β4 integrin. The corresponding CLCA-binding domain of the β4 integrin is localized to the specific determining loop (SDL). Again enzyme-linked immunosorbent, pull-down, and adhesion assays were used to confirm the interaction with CLCA proteins using a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein representing the C-terminal two-thirds of β4 SDL (amino acids 184–203). A chimeric β4 integrin in which the indicated SDL sequence had been replaced with the corresponding sequence from the β1 integrin failed to bind hCLCA2. The dominance of the CLCA ligand in β4 activation and outside-in signaling is discussed in reference to our previous report that β4/CLCA ligation elicits selective signaling via focal adhesion kinase to promote metastatic growth.

Distinct vascular addresses, so-called addressins, have been implicated in playing a major role in the colonization of select organs by blood-borne cancer cells (for reviews, see Refs. 1.Ruoslahti E.

The surface molecule by which lung-metastatic cancer cells recognize hCLCA2 (and its murine equivalents mCLCA1 and mCLCA5) is the β4 integrin, establishing for the first time a cell-cell adhesion function for this integrin that involves an entirely new adhesion partner (4.Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.-C. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25438-25446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Accordingly, all lung-metastatic human and mouse cancer cell lines available to us (e.g. MDA-MB-231, 4T1, CSML-100, B16-F10, and LLC) prominently expressed this integrin on their surfaces, while tumor cells that were unable to colonize the lungs upon tail vein injection of syngeneic or xenogeneic immunocompromised mice (e.g. MCF7, T47D, 67NR, and CSML-0) did not express β4 integrin and were unable to bind to endothelial CLCAs. 2B. U. Pauli, unpublished data. Adhesion to endothelial CLCAs is augmented by an increased surface expression of the α6β4 integrin in cancer cells selected in vivo for enhanced lung colonization (4.Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.-C.

This skepticism is fueled by the “unusual” binding interaction of the β4 integrin involving a putative chloride channel protein to achieve pulmonary vascular arrest of blood-borne cancer cells and to promote early metastatic growth and by the notion that β4 is perceived as a “non-obligatory” molecule in metastasis. However, integrins are rapidly emerging as important regulators of ion channels (for a review, see Ref. 12.Davis M.J. Wu X. Nurkiewicz T.R. Kawasaki J. Gui P. Hill M.A. Wilson E. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 36: 41-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In some cases, such regulation involves the direct interaction between integrin and channel protein as exemplified by the binding of the β1 integrin to the RGD domain of inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRK1 and GIRK2) (13.McPhee J.C. Dang Y.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34696-34702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover increasing numbers of reports identify plural roles for ion channels that reach beyond their channel function (for reviews, see Refs. 5.Pauli B.U. Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.C. Gruber A.D.

Biophys. 2002; 36: 41-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A classical example of this functional diversity is the Na+/H+-exchanger. In addition to regulating intracellular pH homeostasis and cell volume, the Na+/H+-exchanger NHE1 acting independently of its transporter function is critical for the dynamic reorganization of the cortical cytoskeleton in response to extracellular signals, regulating the assembly of focal adhesions, the formation of actin stress fibers, and the cell shape and serving as an anchor of the actin-based cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane (for a review, see Ref. 14.Putney L.K. Denker S.P. Barber D.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 527-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar).

A similar controversy surrounds the status of the β4 integrin as an obligatory molecule in cancer metastasis, albeit the β4 integrin has been associated with malignant progression and metastasis in several human cancers (for a review, see Ref. 23.Rabinovitz I. Mercurio A.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In breast cancer, the association between β4 integrin and metastasis has been studied most thoroughly, and the reported data are consistent with a mechanistic role of the β4 integrin in the complex process of metastasis. These data include the following. (i) The β4 integrin is associated consistently with breast cancers originating from basal cells, which are well known for their aggressive behavior including metastasis, but rarely with the more “benign” tumors of luminal origin (24.Perou C.M. Sorlie T. Eisen MB. van de Rijn M. Jeffrey S.S. Rees C.A. Pollack J.R. Ross D.T. Johnsen H. Akslen L.A. Fluge O. Pergamenschikov A. Williams C. Zhu S.X. Lonning P.E. Borresen-Dale A.L. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Nature. 2000; 406: 747-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (11734) Google Scholar). (ii) Individuals that express both β4 and laminin-5 in their primary tumors have the poorest prognosis among breast cancer patients (25.Tagliabue E. Ghirelli C. Squicciarini P. Aiello P. Colnaghi M.I. Ménard S. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 407-410PubMed Google Scholar). (iii) More than 50% of dormant cancer cells isolated from bone marrow express the α6 and/or β4 integrin subunits (26.Putz E. Witter K. Offner S. Stosiek P. Zippelius A. Johnson J. Zahn R. Riethmüller G. Pantel K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 241-248PubMed Google Scholar). (iv) Lymph node metastases originating from β4-negative primary breast cancers often stain positive for the β4 integrin (27.Natali P.G. Nicotra M.R. Botti C. Mottolese M. Bigotti A. Segatto O. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 66: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). (v) The MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell line known for its invasive and metastatic behavior prominently expresses β4 integrin (4.Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.-C. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1994074775,"The RET receptor tyrosine kinase is activated by binding to a ligand complex formed by a member of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family of neurotrophic factors bound to its cognate GDNF-family receptor-α (GFRα) glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked co-receptor. Molecular modeling studies of the extracellular domain of RET (RETECD) have revealed the existence of four cadherin-like domains (CLD1–4) followed by a cysteine-rich domain. Cross-linking experiments have indicated that the RETECD makes direct contacts with both the GDNF ligand and GFRα1 molecule in the complex, although it has low or no detectable affinity for either component alone. We have exploited sequence and functional divergences between the ectodomains of mammalian and amphibian RET molecules to map binding determinants in the human RETECD responsible for its interaction with the GDNF-GFRα1 complex by homologue-scanning mutagenesis. We found that Xenopus RETECD was unable to bind to GDNF-GFRα-1 or neurturin (NTN)-GFRα-2 complexes of mammalian origin. However, a chimeric molecule containing CLD1, -2, and -3 from human RETECD, but neither domain alone, had similar binding activity as compared with wild type human RETECD, suggesting the existence of an extended ligand binding surface within the three N-terminal cadherin-like domains of human RETECD. Subsequent loss-of-function experiments at higher resolution identified three small subsets of residues, mapping on the same face of the molecular model of RET CLD1, that were required for the interaction of human RETECD with the GDNF-GFRα1 complex. Additional experiments demonstrated that N-linked glycosylation of human RETECD was not required for ligand binding. Based on these observations, we propose a model for the assembly and architecture of the GDNF-GFRα1-RET complex."
https://openalex.org/W2029434623,"Bladder carcinogenesis remains unclear despite the identification of chemical, environmental and genetic factors. It has recently been reported that the chromosomal region 12q13-q15, containing crucial cancer genes such as MDM2, CDK4 and GLI, is amplified in bladder cancer. In the same region are also located the genes of the locus HOX C, flanked by keratin genes whose protein product may be a prognostic marker of bladder cancer. The HOX genes constitute a network of transcription factors controlling embryonal development and play an important role in crucial adult eukaryotic cell functions. The molecular organization of this 39-gene network is unique in the genome and probably acts by regulating phenotypical cell identity. We have analysed the expression of the whole HOX gene network in pairs of normal-tumour bladder and in tumoral biopsies. Comparison between normal urothelium and bladder tumour has identified dramatic variations of expression in a block of three genes (HOX C4, HOX C5 and HOX C6) localized in the HOX C locus on the chromosome 12q13 and in the paralogous group 11 HOX genes, involved during normal development in the formation of the urogenital system. These data suggest a key involvement of the HOX gene network, and especially the locus C, in bladder cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2036412247,"Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) plays a critical role in endothelial cells during the processes of angiogenesis and vascular remodeling. Endothelial cell production of MMP-2 is greatly enhanced when cells are cultured within a three-dimensional type I collagen matrix coinciding with the increased invasive and migratory phenotype of the cells. To define the transcriptional regulation of MMP-2 in rat microvascular endothelial cells, we performed promoter-reporter assays with a series of promoter truncations. Activity of the full promoter was significantly greater in cells cultured within three-dimensional type I collagen compared with cells cultured as a monolayer (two-dimensional) on type I collagen. Truncation of the region encompassing base pairs –1562 to –1375 (relative to the start codon) of the MMP-2 promoter resulted in loss of this differential activity of the MMP-2 promoter. Analysis of this region indicated two putative GATA-2 binding domains between –1437 and –1387. Southwestern blot analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed the binding of GATA-2 to this region of the MMP-2 promoter. Overexpression of GATA-2 in COS-7 cells significantly increased the activity of the full-length MMP-2 promoter-luciferase construct. Endothelial cells expressed greater levels of GATA-2 protein in three-dimensional compared with two-dimensional cultures, and activity of the –1437/–1387 region of the MMP-2 promoter was significantly greater in three-dimensional cultured endothelial cells. Together, these results indicate GATA-2 regulation of the MMP-2 promoter in endothelial cells and that the GATA-2 binding domain is sufficient to drive increased activity of the MMP-2 promoter in response to an extracellular matrix stimulus.

Endothelial cell production and activation of MMPs, including MMP-2, are critical for the process of angiogenesis (3Nguyen M. Arkell J. Jackson C.J. Int. J. Biochem.

The angiogenic process requires that endothelial cells proteolyze their basement membrane and then migrate through the interstitial matrix to form a new capillary. Inhibition of MMP activity prevents basement membrane degradation and the process of capillary sprouting in activity-stimulated skeletal muscle (6Haas T.L. Milkiewicz M. Davis S.J. Zhou A.L.

Regulation of MMP-2 occurs at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. Although the rate of MMP-2 protein production is controlled largely through alterations in mRNA transcription, proteolytic activity is regulated through secretion, cell surface binding, and activation of the latent enzyme (2Nagase H. Cell Res. 1998; 8: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In contrast to the large amount of information available regarding the regulation of MMP-2 activity at the protein level, transcriptional regulation of MMP-2 has not been well characterized. MMP-2 promoter analysis has been carried out in several cell types of both rat and human origin. The MMP-2 promoter has no TATA or CAAT boxes and is considered to be under constitutive control via GC-rich promoter regions. An enhancer region, known as RE1, has been identified at base pairs –1322 to –1282 of the rat promoter sequence (9Harendza S. Polluck A.S. Mertens P.R. Lovett D.H. J. Biol.

Characterization of the promoter in rat endothelial cells identified an additional enhancer region (RE2) at base pairs –1435/–1375 (13Bottles K.D. Bullen E.C. Updike D.L. Vu T. K. Phelps E.

These authors demonstrated greater binding activity to the enhancer region in endothelial cells derived from spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) versus normotensive (WKY) rats, but the binding protein(s) was never identified. The human MMP-2 promoter sequence differs from the rat sequence, but several enhancer domains appear to be common between the two species. For instance, the human MMP-2 promoter is activated by p53 (14Bian J. Sun Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and AP-2 (15Frisch S.M. Morasaki J.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1990; 10: 6524-6532Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar) in a region designated enhancer region 2 (r2) that is located at –1635/–1593 relative to the transcription initiation start. We have shown that MMP-2 production in rat microvascular endothelial cells is sensitive to the extracellular matrix environment and is largely unresponsive to growth factor stimulation (8Haas T.L. Davis S.J. Madri J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3604-3610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which extracellular matrix stimulation enhances endothelial cell transcription of MMP-2 is not yet known. In this study, we examined the rat MMP-2 promoter activity in rat microvascular endothelial cells under control and three-dimensional collagen-stimulated conditions. Our results provide strong evidence that the transcription factor GATA-2 is important in enhancing transcription of the MMP-2 promoter in response to three-dimensional collagen. These data suggest that GATA-2 may be a critical transcription factor regulating MMP-2 under pro-angiogenic conditions. Cell Culture—Microvascular endothelial cells were isolated from rat extensor digitorum longus muscles using a protocol adapted from Madri and Williams (16Madri J.A. Williams S.K. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Briefly, the muscles were isolated, minced, and digested with 0.5% collagenase type I (Invitrogen) in sterile HEPES-saline buffer (140 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm MgCl2) in a shaking water bath (37 °C for 30 min). The tissue was then centrifuged, resuspended twice in HEPES-saline buffer containing 5% bovine serum albumin, then resuspended in 1 ml of HEPE-saline with 1% bovine serum albumin and layered over a Percoll gradient and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min. The layer corresponding to the microvascular fragments was removed, washed with HEPES-saline-1% bovine serum albumin, and resuspended in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (10% fetal calf serum, sodium pyruvate, l-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin) containing 5 ng/ml recombinant vascular endothelial cell growth factor (Calbiochem) and plated onto gelatin-coated flasks. Cells were subcultured every 3–4 days and used for experiments between passages 4 and 10. Endothelial identity was confirmed by positive endothelial cell nitric-oxide synthase and von Willebrand's factor staining, and uptake of acetylated low density lipoprotein. Monolayer (two-dimensional) and three-dimensional cultures were set up as described previously. Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were plated on 35-mm dishes pre-absorbed with a thin layer of type I collagen (two-dimensional) or embedded within a three-dimensional collagen matrix (2.5 mg/ml acid-soluble type I collagen (ICN) buffered with Earle's salt and neutralized with sterile NaOH) at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml collagen and cultured for 24 or 48 h in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without vascular endothelial cell growth factor. COS-7 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Gelatin Zymography—Cells were lysed in 120 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.7), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5% glycerol. Lysates were pelleted to clear cellular debris, and protein was quantified using bicinchonic acid assay (Pierce). 10 μg of protein were size-fractionated through 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel impregnated with 0.02% gelatin under nonreducing conditions. Gels were washed in 2.5% Triton X-100 and then incubated for 20 h at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm calcium chloride. Gels were fixed and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 as described previously (8Haas T.L. Davis S.J. Madri J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3604-3610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Gels were imaged using a FluorChem gel documentation system, and densitometry was performed using Alpha-Ease software. Cleared bands were quantified by densitometry to calculate total MMP-2 protein (sum of latent and active bands), and % active MMP-2, calculated as (active band/total MMP-2) × 100. Northern Blotting—Total cellular RNA was extracted from two-dimensional or three-dimensional cultured endothelial cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. The RNA concentration was determined by spectrophotometer. 10 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed through a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel as described previously (8Haas T.L. Davis S.J. Madri J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3604-3610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with SYBR green to visualize ribosomal subunits. The cDNA probe encoding mouse MMP-2 was labeled with α-[32P]dCTP using random primer labeling (New England Biolabs) and separated from unincorporated nucleotides using G-50 spin columns (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were hybridized overnight, washed, and then exposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) at –80 °C. Films were imaged with the FluorChem system, and intensities of MMP-2 mRNA bands were normalized to 28 S densities to control for loading. Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts of endothelial cells cultured for 24 h on two-dimensional collagen (12.5 μg/cm2) or three-dimensional collagen were prepared according to a previous study (17Haas T.L. Stitelman D. Davis S.J. Apte S.S. Madri J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22679-22685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and quantified using bicinchonic acid assay (Pierce). Western and Southwestern Blots—For Western blots, nuclear extracts (10 μg) were separated using 12% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking, blots were incubated overnight with antibodies for AP-2 or p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or YB-1 (kindly provided by Dr. David Lovett, San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center, University of California). After secondary antibody incubation, bands were detected using the SuperSignal West Pico (Pierce) and FluorChem gel documentation systems (AlphaInnotech). Densitometry was performed using AlphaEase software. For Southwestern blots, nuclear extracts (15 μg) were separated using 12% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions, which were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After renaturing and blocking overnight at 4 °C in TNED buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 5% skim milk powder, blots were washed with TNED buffer and then hybridized for 5 h at room temperature using TNED buffer containing 10 μg/ml poly(dI·dC) and 8 pmol of γ-[32P]ATP-labeled double-stranded probe corresponding to base pairs –1435 to –1387 of the MMP-2 promoter (synthesized by Sigma). Blots were washed twice for 15 min with TNED and then exposed to x-ray film at –80 °C using an enhancing screen. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Consensus GATA-2 binding double-stranded oligonucleotides (5′-CCTGGCTTATCTCCGGCTGC-3′; Panomics) and complimentary oligonucleotides corresponding to base pairs –1435 to –1387 or –1329 to –1293 of the MMP-2 promoter were annealed and end-labeled using γ-[32P]ATP. An enriched source of human GATA-2 in vitro transcribed and translated from pMT2-GATA2 (kindly provided by Dr. Stuart Orkin) with the Promega TnT system was used to define the binding pattern of this transcription factor to consensus GATA-2 binding domains and to the MMP-2 promoter region. Gel shift reactions consisted of a 5 × 104 cpm oligonucleotide probe, binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol), 1 μg of poly(dI·dC), 500 ng of salmon sperm DNA, 1 μl of TnT reaction, or 5–10 μg of nuclear extract. For supershift assays, 1–4 μl of antibody (anti-GATA-2 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology or anti-GATA-2 kindly provided by Dr. Stuart Orkin) was added to the reaction and incubated for 15 min prior to gel loading. Reactions were electrophoresed through a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography. Transient Transfections—The rat MMP-2 promoter (72-PGL2) was provided kindly by Dr. David Lovett. The full-length promoter (–1686 base pairs to the ATG codon) was subcloned into pGL3Basic (Promega). Truncations were constructed using restriction enzyme double digests (KpnI-AflII, KpnI-AlwN1, KpnI-PstI, and KpnI-SmaI) followed by gel purification and ligation of the plasmid, transformation into bacteria, and purification of selected colonies using Qiafilter Midi Preps (Qiagen). LipofectAMINE-based transient transfections of MMP-2 promoter sequences and Renilla luciferase were performed on COS-7 cells or on primary cultures of rat microvascular endothelial cells (passages 6–10) according to the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen). For COS-7 transfections, cells were lysed 48 h after transfection. For endothelial cell transfections, 24 h after transfection, cells were trypsinized and divided into two-dimensional and three-dimensional conditions. 48 h after two-dimensional and three-dimensional culturing, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity according to the Promega Dual Luciferase Reporter System. Luminescence was detected with a Berthold 9501 tube luminometer. Data were normalized for activity of Renilla luciferase to account for transfection efficiency and then expressed as -fold increase in comparison with the light output of the pGL3 Basic or pGL3 promoter constructs. Results from four independent experiments, each with duplicate wells, were averaged and presented as mean ± S.E. Statistics—Statistical analyses of two-dimensional and three-dimensional conditions were performed using Student's paired t tests with significance established as p < 0.05. Rat skeletal muscle microvascular endothelial cells cultured for 24 h within a three-dimensional collagen type I matrix produced significantly greater MMP-2 mRNA and protein when compared with cells cultured on a thin monolayer coating of collagen type I (Fig. 1, A and B). Likewise, the MMP-2 promoter analysis demonstrated greater transcriptional activity of the full-length promoter in endothelial cells cultured in three-dimensional compared with two-dimensional conditions (Fig. 1C). Truncation of the promoter region (from –1562 to –1375) removed the responsiveness to the three-dimensional collagen culture condition. Further deletion of –1365 to –510 again reduced promoter activity but did not have a differential effect on cells in two-dimensional versus three-dimensional culture (Fig. 1C). The region between –1322 and –1282 has previously been designated as RE1 by Lovett and colleagues (9Harendza S. Polluck A.S. Mertens P.R. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18786-18796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This region contains binding sites for transcription factors YB-1, AP-2, and p53 (11Mertens P.R. Steinmann K. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. En-Nia A. Sun Y. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24875-24882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We tested whether these transcription factors were induced in three-dimensional culture by Western blotting of nuclear extracts. There was no change in p53 (0.91 ± 0.32), a slight decrease in AP-2 (0.80 ± 0.07), and a strong decrease in YB-1 (0.11 ± 0.1, p < 0.05), in three-dimensional culture compared with their two-dimensional levels (Fig. 2, A–C). Gel shift assays using double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to base pairs –1327 to –1293 of the MMP-2 promoter showed two shifted complexes; the faster mobility complex was of similar intensity in nuclear extracts of cells in two-dimensional compared with three-dimensional cultures, whereas the slower mobility complex was greatly reduced in three-dimensional compared with two-dimensional nuclear extracts (Fig. 2D). We thus focused on the region of the MMP-2 promoter that lies between –1562 and –1375. A transcription factor search on this region using the TRANSFAC data base (18Wingender E. Chen X. Hehl R. Karas H. Liebich I. Meinhardt T. Prub M. Reuter I. Schacherer F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar) identified two sites located at –1431/–1422 and –1399/–1390 that shared considerable homology to the nominal binding sequence for the transcription factor GATA-2 (Fig. 3A). This region corresponds to a portion of the enhancer region described by Bottles et al. (13Bottles K.D. Bullen E.C. Updike D.L. Vu T. K. Phelps E. Grammas P. Howard E.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1428: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We then examined protein binding to this sequence first through Southwestern blotting. Using endothelial cell nuclear extract as a protein source, this technique identified a weak band (of ∼53 kDa) that interacted with the labeled MMP-2 promoter sequence (Fig. 3B). This size is consistent with GATA-2, as has been demonstrated by other researchers using Western blotting (19Towatari M. May G.E. Marais R. Perkins G.R. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. Enver T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4101-4107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We tested specifically for GATA-2 protein binding ability to the MMP-2 promoter sequence using gel shift assay with in vitro transcribed and translated GATA-2 protein. Two shifted bands were detected when binding to the MMP-2 promoter sequence, whereas one band was detected when binding to the consensus GATA-2 oligonucleotide (Fig. 3C). Incubation of the protein-DNA complex with anti-GATA-2 antibody resulted in a supershifted complex, a decreased intensity of the slower mobility protein-DNA complex (solid arrow), and increased intensity of the faster mobility protein-DNA complex (open arrowhead) (Fig. 3D). It is likely that both bands correspond to GATA-2 binding and arise from variable levels of protein interaction to the two GATA-2 binding sites present in the MMP-2 promoter sequence (compared with the single site on the consensus oligonucleotide). We tested for direct evidence that GATA-2 trans-activates the MMP-2 promoter by cotransfecting COS-7 cells with GATA-2 or empty expression vector and the full-length MMP-2 promoter-luciferase construct. Western blotting confirmed the effectiveness of the overexpression procedure in elevating levels of GATA-2 protein in the COS cells (Fig. 4A). MMP-2 promoter activity was enhanced 3.3-fold (p < 0.05) in the presence of GATA-2 overexpression compared with the empty vector (Fig. 4B). To assess the role of GATA-2 in the transcriptional control of MMP-2 in endothelial cells, we first examined endogenous levels of GATA-2 in cells cultured in two-dimensional or three-dimensional type I collagen. By Western blotting, GATA-2 protein was increased in the nuclear extracts of endothelial cells cultured in three-dimensional collagen compared with two-dimensional collagen (Fig. 5A). Similarly, gel shift assays showed formation of GATA-2 complexes in the presence of both two-dimensional and three-dimensional nuclear extracts, but these complexes were more intense in the presence of the three-dimensional cultured endothelial cell nuclear extracts (Fig. 5B). These complexes were identical to those seen using the in vitro transcribed and translated GATA-2 (Fig. 3, C and D) and were competed with 10–50-fold excess cold oligonucleotide and supershifted with anti-GATA-2 antibody (data not shown). We confirmed the differential activity of the GATA-2 binding region in response to extracellular matrix cues through transient transfection of microvascular endothelial cells with the GATA-2 binding sequence of the MMP-2 promoter (–1435/–1387) coupled to the pGL3 promoter followed by culturing the transfected cells in two-dimensional or three-dimensional culture conditions for 48 h. Extracts from cells in the three-dimensional culture condition had significantly greater trans-activation of the GATA-2 binding sequence compared with those from two-dimensional culture conditions (1.8-fold above two-dimensional conditions, p < 0.05; Fig. 5C). This study shows that the transcription factor, GATA-2, enhances the transcription of MMP-2 in microvascular endothelial cells cultured within a three-dimensional type I collagen matrix. These results provide the first mechanistic evidence of extracellular matrix-driven transcriptional regulation of the MMP-2 gene. Despite considerable evidence for regulation of the MMP-2 promoter by YB-1, AP-2, and p53 interactions in rat mesangial cells (10Mertens P.R. Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22905-22912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar,11Mertens P.R. Steinmann K. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. En-Nia A. Sun Y. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24875-24882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we failed to detect a role for this region in conferring extracellular matrix responsiveness to the MMP-2 promoter. These transcription factors may contribute to overall promoter activity, as a truncation that removed a region of the promoter that included the RE1 region (–1322 to –1282) greatly reduced promoter activity in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional cultured endothelial cells (Fig. 1). We observed by Western blotting that the protein level of YB-1 was significantly lower in nuclear extracts of three-dimensional compared with two-dimensional cultured endothelial cells. Y-box binding proteins, including YB-1, can interact with both DNA and RNA resulting in transcriptional or translational activation or repression depending on the genes in question (20Matsumoto K. Wolfe A.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 318-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Whereas the Y-box protein dpbB is reported to contribute to the transcriptional activation of thrombin-induced genes in endothelium (21Stenina O.I. Shaneyfelt K.M. DiCorleto P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7277-7282Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the regulation of YB-1 expression and function in endothelial cells has not yet been reported. Interestingly, the collagen type α1(I) gene in fibroblasts is repressed strongly by YB-1 interaction with the proximal promoter (22Norman J.T. Lindahl G.E. Shakib K. En-Nia A. Yilmaz E. Mertens P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29880-29890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Our results may be consistent with the role of YB-1 as a transcriptional repressor of MMP-2 in endothelial cells, because lower levels of YB-1 protein are present in three-dimensional cultured cells. It is possible that YB-1 may act to repress or interfere with transcriptional activation of MMP-2 by GATA-2, whereas the relief of YB-1 in three-dimensional conditions contributes to the overall positive transcriptional response. However, this remains to be clarified through additional experimentation as we have not specifically examined the effects of YB-1 overexpression on the MMP-2 promoter. Rather, we defined a role for GATA-2 direct interaction with the MMP-2 promoter region –1435/–1387 utilizing analyses of in vitro DNA-protein complex formation (Figs. 3 and 5) and confirmed the trans-activation capability of GATA-2 through measurements of MMP-2 transcriptional activity in COS-7 and microvascular endothelial cells (Figs. 4 and 5). Together, these experiments provide clear evidence that GATA-2 interacts with the MMP-2 promoter and that this interaction enhances promoter activity. Increased levels of GATA-2 protein and enhanced binding of GATA-2 to the MMP-2 promoter occur in response to culture within a three-dimensional collagen matrix, implying that this domain acts as a response element for extracellular matrix-driven signaling events. Although we have not tested for GATA-2 binding to the human MMP-2 promoter sequence, it is notable that the dual GATA-2 binding sites with 21 nucleotides separating them are highly conserved between human and rat promoters. The equivalent binding domains are located at base pairs –1434/–1425 and –1403/1394 of the human MMP-2 sequence, as published by Bian and Sun (14Bian J. Sun Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). GATA-2 is a member of the GATA family of DNA binding proteins that interacts with a DNA sequence motif (WGATAR) through highly conserved C2C2 zinc finger domains (23Orkin S.H. Blood. 1992; 80: 575-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,24Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 13: 3999-4010Crossref Scopus (564) Google Scholar). This family of transcription factors initially was recognized to play an important role in regulating expression of multiple genes in cells of erythroid origin, although it is now known that these transcription factors are also expressed in cells of other origin such as fibroblasts, embryonic brain, cardiac muscle, liver, and kidney (25Dorfman D.M. Wilson D.B. Bruns G.A. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1279-1285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human GATA-2 was cloned from endothelial cells following discovery of its critical role in regulating transcription of the preproendothelin-1 gene (25Dorfman D.M. Wilson D.B. Bruns G.A. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1279-1285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,26Wilson D.B. Dorfman D.M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1990; 10: 4854-4862Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Since that time, studies have demonstrated that GATA-2 regulates multiple endothelial cell genes including endothelial cell nitricoxide synthase (27Zhang R. Min W. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15320-15326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (28Minami T. Aird W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47632-47641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (29Gumina R.J. Kirschbaum N.E. Piotrowski K. Newman P.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 1260-1269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor flk1/KDR (30Minami T. Rosenberg R.D. Aird W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5395-5402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Interestingly, many of the genes regulated by GATA-2 are endothelial cell-specific, and, in fact, cellular dedifferentiation of endothelial cells is linked to reduced expression of several transcription factors including GATA-2 (31Thum T. Haverich A. Borlak J. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, GATA-2 itself cannot provide cell type specificity because it is found in a number of cell types. Rather, it is thought that endothelial cell-specific gene expression in these cases is achieved by cooperativity between GATA-2 and additional transcription factors. Several studies have shown cooperative interactions between GATA-2 and other transcription factors, including Sp1 (27Zhang R. Min W. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15320-15326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and c-fos and c-jun (32Kawana M. Lee M.E. Quertermous E.E. Quertermous T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 15: 4225-4231Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In addition, a family of proteins that include “friend of gata,” or FOG, FOG-2, and U-shaped (Ush) transcription factors are known to play critical roles as cofactors for GATA transcription factors in both erythroid (33Tsang A.P. Fujiwara Y. Hom D.B. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1176-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and cardiac muscle (34Tevosian S.G. Deconinck A.E. Cantor A.B. Rieff H.I. Fujiwara Y. Corfas G. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 950-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar,35Tevosian S.G. Deconinck A.E. Tanaka K. Schinke M. Litovsky S.H. Izumo S. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Cell. 2000; 101: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). It is possible that similar cooperative interactions can modulate the effectiveness of GATA-2 trans-activation of the MMP-2 promoter. Utilizing gel shift analysis, we observed two shifted bands corresponding to GATA-2 interactions with the MMP-2 promoter sequence (–1435/–1387). We think that both bands represent specific GATA-2 interactions with the MMP-2 promoter oligonucleotide, which has two putative GATA-2 binding sites. Both bands were competed with cold oligonucleotide. The addition of GATA-2-specific antibodies resulted in either 1) a supershifted band with a decrease in intensity of the slower migrating protein-DNA complex and an increase in intensity of the faster migrating protein-DNA complex (Fig. 3D) or 2), when a greater amount of antibody was added, in the complete competition of both bands (data not shown). Despite this evidence, it is possible that the multiple gel shift bands result from related GATA protein interactions with the DNA probe, or from GATA-2 interactions with other proteins. Although GATA-2 was thought to be the predominant GATA factor found in endothelial cells (25Dorfman D.M. Wilson D.B. Bruns G.A. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1279-1285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a more recent study has identified the mRNA for GATA-3 and GATA-6 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and demonstrated that these factors can bind to and trans-activate the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 promoter (36Umetani M. Mataki C. Minegishi N. Yamamoto M. Hamakubo T. Kodama T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have shown that GATA-2 protein, by itself, is sufficient to trans-activate the MMP-2 promoter (Fig. 4B), but the possibility of enhanced MMP-2 transcription in the presence of additional GATA factors bears further investigation. We previously found that the early growth response-1 (egr-1) transcription factor trans-activates the membrane type 1 (MT1)-MMP promoter sequence in response to three-dimensional type I collagen stimulation (17Haas T.L. Stitelman D. Davis S.J. Apte S.S. Madri J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22679-22685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Because MT1-MMP and MMP-2 gene products frequently appear to be co-regulated, we originally were surprised that the MMP-2 promoter lacks consensus binding sites for egr-1. The current study provides evidence for GATA-2 as a critical transcription factor in the regulation of the MMP-2 promoter under the pro-angiogenic condition of three-dimensional type I collagen stimulation. We have recently demonstrated a critical role for extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 activation in the regulation of both MMP-2 and MT1-MMP mRNA in three-dimensional collagen-stimulated endothelial cells. 2P. J. Boyd and T. L. Haas, unpublished observations. Notably, both egr-1 and GATA-2 are downstream effectors of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 signal pathway (19Towatari M. May G.E.

Res. 1997; 81: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), implying that extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 may be a critical component of a common signal pathway responsible for recruitment of both transcription factors. Further studies will elucidate the mechanisms by which extracellular matrix-driven signaling results in coordinated recruitment of diverse transcription factors and activation of the transcription of multiple genes critical for the process of angiogenesis. We thank Dr. Stuart Orkin for providing GATA-2 antibody and expression vector and Dr. David Lovett for providing the rat MMP-2 promoter and YB-1 antibody."

We used genome-wide expression analyses coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments to study the regulatory relationships between two very similar yeast transcription factors involved in the control of the multidrug resistance phenomenon. Yrm1 (Yor172w) is a new zinc finger transcription factor, the overproduction of which decreases the level of transcription of the target genes of Yrr1, a zinc finger transcription factor controlling the expression of several membrane transporter-encoding genes. Surprisingly, the absence of YRR1 releases the transcriptional activity of Yrm1, which then up-regulates 23 genes, 14 of which are also direct target genes of Yrr1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that Yrm1 binds to the promoters of the up-regulated genes only in yeast strains from which YRR1 has been deleted. This sophisticated regulatory program can be associated with drug resistance phenotypes of the cell. The program-specific distribution of paired transcription factors throughout the genome may be a general mechanism by which similar transcription factors regulate overlapping gene expression programs in response to chemical stress.

The program-specific distribution of paired transcription factors throughout the genome may be a general mechanism by which similar transcription factors regulate overlapping gene expression programs in response to chemical stress. Promoter occupancy by transcription factors is a critical step in establishment of the developmental program. In several cases, the transcription factor binds all its potential target genes, and signaling events at specific promoters are responsible for determining which genes are expressed. Alternatively, the regulation of target gene selection could occur at the level of DNA binding. New tools have opened up new opportunities for studying the program-specific distribution of transcription factors (1Zeitlinger J. Simon I. Harbison C.T. Hannett N.M. Volkert T.L. Fink G.R. Young R.A. Cell. 2003; 113: 395-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), revealing a high level of sophistication in the DNA binding program. Paralogous transcription factors often seem to interact with similar promoters, although little is known about the specific mechanism involved. Gene duplication, by conferring new evolutionary possibilities, provides an important source of diversity in the regulatory processes controlling gene expression. This is particularly true of the genes encoding transcription factors. The genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisisae contains a number of genes encoding transcriptional activators that exist as protein pairs (2Goffeau A. Barrell B.G. Bussey H. Davis R.W. Dujon B. Feldmann H. Galibert F. Hoheisel J. Jacq C. Johnston M. Louis E.J. Mewes H.W. Murakami Y. Philippsen P. Tettelin H. Oliver S.G.

Pdr1 and Pdr3 have highly similar Zn finger domains and activate similar sets of target genes (3DeRisi J. van den Hazel B. Marc P. Balzi E. Brown P. Jacq C. Goffeau A.

Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4043-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Moreover, Pdr3 has been shown to be activated by mitochondrial signals (6Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S. J.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) whereas Pdr1 is under the regulatory control of the Hsp70 protein Pdr13 (8Hallstrom T.C. Katzmann D.J. Torres R.J. Sharp W.J. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which is now known as Ssz1 (9Gautschi M. Lilie H. Funfschilling U. Mun A. Ross S. Lithgow T. Rucknagel P. Rospert S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3762-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Swi5 and AceII recognize the same DNA promoter sequences in vitro but transactivate different genes due to context effects and negative regulators (10Dohrmann P.R. Voth W.P. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1746-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Aft2, like its paralog Aft1, is a transcriptional activator that responds to iron. However, Aft1 and Aft2 regulate the iron regulon to different extents (11Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Ray E. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14322-14327Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 12Blaiseau P.L. Lesuisse E. Camadro J.M. J. Biol.

Cat8 and Sip4, two very similar transcription factors, are two CSRE-binding proteins that contribute unequally to the activation of genes containing the carbon source-responsive element (CSRE) in their promoters (14Hiesinger M. Roth S. Meissner E. Schuller H.J. Curr. Genet. 2001; 39: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Cat8 is required for the derepression of SIP4 under nonfermentative growth conditions (15Haurie V. Perrot M. Mini T. Jeno P. Sagliocco F. Boucherie H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 76-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). One of the most salient feature of differential regulation of two similar transcription factors have been recently described for Msn2/Msn4 (16Jacquet M. Renault G. Lallet S. De Mey J. Goldbeter A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; PubMed Google Scholar). The cAMP-PKA pathway was shown to control the sensitivity of Msn2/Msn4 oscillatory shuttling and, in the absence of PKA, Msn4 continues to oscillate whereas Msn2 remains in the nucleus. All these examples suggest that the evolutionary duplication of genes encoding transcription factors has resulted in factors controlling similar sets of target genes that are themselves differently regulated. However, this is not a hard-and-fast rule because Haa1, a protein homologous to the copper-regulated transcription factor AceI, acts independently of the copper status of the cell and does not regulate the three genes activated by AceI (17Keller G. Ray E. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38697-38702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, we focused on a new pair of transcription factors, Yrr1/Yrm1, with alternative DNA binding properties. Yrr1 was recently identified as a Zn2Cys6 transcription factor involved in control of the pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) 1The abbreviations used are: PDRpleiotropic drug resistancePKAcAMP-dependent kinaseHAhemagglutininMHRmiddle homology regionGADGal4 activation domainYRMyeast reveromycin resistance modulatorChIPchromatin immunoprecipitation assay. phenomenon (18Cui Z.

Gain-of-function mutations in its activation domain confer high level resistance to the cell cycle inhibitor reveromycin A, to the DNA-damaging agent 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide and to oligomycin (19Zhang X.

Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2642-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Yrr1 affects oligomycin resistance by activating YOR1 expression via a region in the YOR1 promoter that is very similar, but not identical, to the PDRE elements recognized by Pdr1/Pdr3 (19Zhang X. Cui Z. Miyakawa T. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8812-8819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). An intricate interplay of cross-regulation links YRR1, PDR1, and PDR3. PDR1 regulates PDR3 and YRR1, both of which regulate their own expression (5Delahodde A. Delaveau T. Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4043-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 19Zhang X. Cui Z. Miyakawa T. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol.

In addition, different post-translational processes, including nuclear targeting or heterodimer formation (21Mamnun Y.M. Pandjaitan R. Mahe Y. Delahodde A. Kuchler K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1429-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), may be involved in different regulatory pathways. Genome-wide analyses have established that the sets of target genes directly regulated by these three transcription factors display considerable overlap (3DeRisi J. van den Hazel B. Marc P. Balzi E. Brown P. Jacq C. Goffeau A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 4Devaux F. Marc P. Bouchoux C. Delaveau T. Hikkel I. Potier M.C. Jacq C.

Biol. 2002; 22: 2642-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Most of these co-regulated genes encode for proteins involved in the structural organization of the plasma membrane. These proteins include ABC and MFS transporters, together with proteins involved in the control of specific steps in lipid biosynthesis. Accordingly, the drug resistance phenotypes conferred by the gain-of-function mutations for the three transcription factors reflect changes in plasma membrane composition. Thus discrete changes in plasma membrane properties can be accomplished through sophisticated cross-regulations between several transcription factors, not all of which have been identified (22Akache B. Turcotte B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21254-21260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23Moye-Rowley W.S.

YOR172W, referred to here as YRM1 (for yeast reveromycin resistance modulator) is homologous (41% identities) to YRR1. The degree of similarity is higher in the zinc finger domain, but the two proteins display considerable similarity throughout the entire length of their sequences. The sequences in the Cys regions are quasi-identical suggesting that the two factors recognize similar DNA binding motifs. Microarray experiments were carried out to determine whether Yrm1 was a transcription factor and to identify the corresponding direct target genes. The situation turned out to be more complex than expected: Yrm1 acts as a transcription factor and interacts with the promoter of the target genes only in the absence of Yrr1. The sets of target genes directly regulated by YRR1 or YRM1 are similar, but not identical. Alternative promoter occupancy thus plays a key role in this cross-regulation adding a new degree of complexity to the cell drug response. Strains and Media—Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains are described in Table I. Cells were grown in minimal synthetic medium SC (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% carbon source (glucose, galactose, or glycerol+ethanol) supplemented with appropriate amino acids). Drug resistance assays were performed by spot tests with serial dilutions.

For PCR amplification of YOR172W we used the genomic DNA from the BY 4742 strain and the following primers: 5′-TCCTATCCATATGACGTTCCAGATTACGCTGCTCAGGTGAGTAAGCGGGGTAGTTACAG and 3′-AACTAATTACATGATGCGGCCCTCTAGATGCATGCTCCTCTACTGCGTATCAAATAAATA. The inserts from six independent clones were checked by digestion and restriction mapping. Also their tested phenotype was the same. The expression of the cloned gene from two independent clones was checked by Western blot analysis (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), using mouse anti-HA IgG as the primary antibody (Babco) and anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated as the secondary antibody (Promega). The signal was visualized using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). The chimeric construct YRM1*GAD was generated by inserting into pCB-GAD (4Devaux F. Marc P. Bouchoux C. Delaveau T. Hikkel I. Potier M.C. Jacq C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) the first 381 nucleotides of the YOR172W open reading frame. This sequence was amplified by PCR and inserted into the NotI site of pCB-GAD by homologous recombination in the ΔYRM1 strain.

The insert was sequenced and production of the chimeric protein checked by Western blotting, as shown for pYES2-YRM1. Microarray Experiments—The activity of the entire or chimeric Yrm1 protein, produced under control of the GAL1 promoter, was induced on galactose medium by growing cells in glucose minimal medium to an OD600 0.5 and transferring them to galactose minimal medium for various times of induction. We carried out progressive galactose induction of pYES2-YRM1 in the ΔYOR172W, ΔYRR1, and YRR-gof strains and of the YRM1*GAD in the ΔYOR172W and in ΔYRR1 strains for periods of 30′ to 14 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Total RNA was isolated and used to synthesize and to label cDNA as described on our web site (www.biologie.ens.fr/microarrays.html). We performed a total of 12 independent microarray experiments, each of which was repeated at least once. Microarrays containing all the open reading frames of S. cerevisiae were produced in our laboratory with an Omnigrid II Biorobotics robot (www.transcriptome.ens.fr/sgdb). They were based on the principal of 40-mer oligonucleotides from MWG (www.mwg-biotech.com) covalent deposited onto Corning glass slides coated with pure gamma amino propil silane (www.corning.com/lifesciences). Repeat experiments were carried out with microarrays obtained from Hitachi Software and Eurogentec S.A. The microarray protocol used is described on our web site (www.transcriptome.ens.fr/sgdb). A total of 20 μg of total purified RNA was used for each experiment. In each experiment, the cDNA corresponding to cells expressing pYES2-YRM1 or YRM1*GAD was labeled with CY5-dUTP and cDNA from control cells was labeled with CY3-dUTP. The arrays were read using a Genepix 4000A scanner (Axon) and analyzed with Genepix 3.0 software. Artifactual, saturated or low-signal spots were eliminated from the analysis. Fluorochrome-channel normalization was carried out with Arrayplot (25Marc P. Jacq C. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 888-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Up-regulated genes were selected with a custom-made data base, and the analysis was completed with the PCA module of the J-express program (26Dysvik B. Jonassen I. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 369-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Clusters were generated by Treeview (27Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Northern Blot Analyses—Cells were grown on minimal synthetic medium with glucose as carbon source supplemented with corresponded amino acids, to an OD of 0.5, harvested, and transferred to minimal synthetic medium with galactose as carbon source for various lengths of time, from 0 to 14 h. Total RNA, prepared by hot acidic phenol extraction, was used for Northern blot analysis.

Blots were performed using standard procedures (28Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Two forms of Yrm1p were analyzed by ChIP assay: the entire protein produced from the pYES2-YRM1 construct and the chimeric protein produced from YRM1*GAD, both of which producing Yrm1p under the control of the GAL1 promoter. Cells were grown on minimal synthetic medium, with glucose as carbon source supplemented with corresponded amino acids for maintaining of pYES2 or pCB*GAD plasmid to an OD of 0.5, harvested, and transferred to minimal synthetic medium with galactose as carbon source for 6 h. DNA-binding proteins were cross-linked to DNA with formaldehyde in vivo (treatment for 15 min at room temperature). The chromatin was isolated by grinding with glass beads followed by sonication to shear DNA along with bound proteins into small fragments (1–3 kb). A 20-μl aliquot of the lysate was saved as the input fraction. To isolate the DNA-Yrm1 complex, the samples were incubated with mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Babco), and with UltraLink Immobilized Protein G (Pierce). Immunoprecipitates were extensively washed and centrifuged to recover a pellet (bound) and supernatant (unbound). Protein was eluted from the Sepharose beads by heating at 95 °C for 20 min. Cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C for 6 h. The DNA was purified with PCR QiaQuick columns prior to PCR analysis. Both input and bound DNA were dissolved in 40 μl of TE. 1 μl of DNA preparation from each reaction was used for PCR. The Qiagen QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit was used for quantitative real-time PCR. We used LightCycler3 and repeated experiments at least twice. The various primer sets used for amplification of the 27 promoters are presented in Table II. The enrichment factor was calculated as follows: 1) the values of immunoprecipitated amplified DNA were divided by those for the negative control (a non-coding fragment of chromosome V) included in each analysis, and their mean values retained as the crude promoter occupancy value, 2) the ratio of amplified unbound DNA to negative control constituted the background value. The enrichment factor was obtained by dividing the crude promoter occupancy value by the background value.Table IIPrimer sets used for the PCR amplification of promoter genes in the ChIP assayPromoter geneUpstream primerDownstream primerAZR1TGCACTGTTACCATAGGATCTTACCTTAATGTAGTGGTTCTGCTTGACACYLL056CTAGAGAGGACGGACATAAGTCTTCTCTTCAGGAAAGCCAAGAACTAATGYOR1ACACATCTGTCAGAGGTAGCTAGCGTATGGAAATGCGTTCTTCCTGTTYGR035CAGACCCTTTTCCACGGATAATCAGATTGCCCTCAAAACTGTATCTCATCSNG1TCACCACAATAGGTGGATCTCGAAGACGCTTATTGACTACGCYPL088WGTGGAAGTATTTCACCCACGTATGAGTTATCTCCCGTTCCTAACCTACYLR046CTGGTGATAGTTGCGAAAAATGACAGGAGGCAGTTGAGTTCTTTTATCGACYMR102CCCTTTCTTAAGCTTCGTAAGCGAGCCTCCTCTGTTTAACAAGTTGGAGPLB1CCTCATACAGTAACATGTCCGCTTCGTTTCCGTTGGTTAAATGTGGTGYLR179CGTGCCAAGCGTGCTCATTATTGGATTACTAAGTACTCGGATGGGTACCAPD1CAAGTGCAAGGAGAGGGAGAGTTCCCTCCTCCGAATATAGCCAAGTACSFK1CTCTAAACATCTTCCACGGCTGTTCCTTAGATGACAAATCTTCCAGGCTGYLR346CCACCTGCTGAATGCTCAACGTTTGTAGTCCTCTGTGAATGAGCATCACSNQ2ACCTTCACGCCAGACTATGTATGACGGATTTAAACGGAAATGGGCGGACFLR1CTTAGGTAAGGAGCAATAACAGTGCGCAATTCTCGTCTTCTTTCCTGTTYJL216CTCTGGAATTTCTCTCCTTCTCGGATTGTGACTATTTCAATGGYPR127WAGGAAGGGATCTGCGTTTTTGTTCCTATTCTACGGTTCAATAGACACTCPDR16GAGTGCAAGCATGCGATATATCTCCAGACAATGAGCACAATATTGTGCASCS7GACAACAGGGAAAGTTGGACAAACCTGCGAAAAGATGTCACACGTCAGYOR084WTGTCGAAACACTGATGCTATTGTCCTCGTACTACCACATTAAGACGTCTPO4TGCTTACATGCTAATTGTCCTTGTCACTAGAAAATCGATGTGTCAGGTACYDR061WCCTTGAAGCGAAAGACGCATATCATCGTCTCACGATGTCAGCAATCTCADH7AGAGTTGAAGGGCGAACATTTGCGGTGCTCAATTAGTGACATCTGCYBR161WACTTGTCACCGTTGAATAACCGAGCTACTTTAGCACTGTTGTAAGGTGYRR1GCGAATGTAGATTTCTGCCAGTATCGTCTATTACATACGTCTAGTGATGTGGYOR172WCGGTCAAGATAGCCCTAAGTTCCAGGACCATTCAATGTGCTTControl-cz VGGCTGTCAGAATATGGGGCCGTAGTACACCCCGAAGCTGCTTTCACAATAC Open table in a new tab Yrm1 Can Act as a Specific Inhibitor of Yrr1—We recently described the genome-wide regulatory properties of YRR1, a gene encoding a Zn2Cys6 zinc finger transcription factor (20Le Crom S. Devaux F. Marc P. Zhang X. Moye-Rowley W.S. Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2642-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We showed that 15 genes, mostly encoding plasma membrane proteins, are directly up-regulated by various mutated forms of Yrr1. One of these forms consisted of a chimeric protein containing the zinc finger domain of Yrr1 linked to the Gal4 activation domain (GAD). This short chimerical protein named Yrr1*GAD contains the specific DNA binding domain (positions 1–178), devoid of inhibitory activity known to be contained in the central flanking domain, fused to GAD as described (7Devaux F. Carvajal E. Moye-Rowley S. Jacq C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 20Le Crom S. Devaux F. Marc P. Zhang X. Moye-Rowley W.S. Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2642-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This hybrid transcriptional activator has the physiological activity and the DNA binding domain of the natural activator. As YRM1 encodes for an unknown protein with a very similar zinc finger domain, the two proteins might be expected to display similar DNA binding functions. We investigated this issue by first characterizing the properties of the intact form of Yrm1. To this end we constructed a GAL1/YRM1 fusion gene to enable galactose-inducible expression of YRM1. The episomal fusion gene containing the entire YRM1 open reading frame was transformed into a yrm1-deleted strain. Cells pregrown in glucose to mid-log phase were induced with galactose and harvested at various times after the addition of galactose. YRM1 expression was followed by Western blot analyses, using the HA epitope inserted at the C-terminal part of the protein (data not shown). Cells transformed with a control vector devoid of the YRM1 open reading frame were used as reference for transcriptome analyses with microarrays containing oligonucleotide probes for most of the S. cerevisiae genes. Four independent microarray analyses were conducted. Principal results are shown in Fig. 1A. To our surprise, all 14 genes known to be up-regulated by YRR1 (20Le Crom S. Devaux F. Marc P. Zhang X. Moye-Rowley W.S. Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2642-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) turned out to be repressed when YRM1 was overexpressed. Moreover the level of YRM1-dependent repression seemed to parallel YRR1 activation. Northern blot analyses were carried out to validate the microarrays data (data not shown). The observed phenotype (Fig. 1B) of the strain overexpressing YRM1 was consistent with low levels of expression for several genes. Many studies have pointed out the correlation between the level of expression of genes encoding membrane proteins and the drug-specific resistance phenotype (29Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In our case the low levels of SNQ2 expression may be connected to the weak but significant decrease in growth on 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide because SNQ2 is known to confer resistance to this drug (30Servos J. Haase E. Brendel M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A similar situation has been reported for YOR1, which is required for oligomycin resistance (31Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Voet M. Wysock W. Golin J. Volckaert G. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1995; 15: 6875-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Yrm1 Also Decreases the Transcriptional Activity of a Gain-of-Function Mutant of Yrr1—Consistent with the observed effects on the transcriptional activity of YRR1, YRM1 can reduce the gain-of-function phenotype of YRR1. A gain-of-function allele of YRR1 (YRR1::3XHA-730) resulting from insertion of three HA tags in the C-terminal region of Yrr1, has been described (19Zhang X. Cui Z. Miyakawa T. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8812-8819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and the corresponding transcriptome characterized by microarray analyses (20Le Crom S. Devaux F. Marc P. Zhang X. Moye-Rowley W.S. Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2642-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We overexpressed YRM1 in a strain carrying the genomic version of YRR1::3XHA-730; the corresponding transcriptome displayed a clear reduction in expression of the 15 genes previously found to be up-regulated by YRR1 (Fig. 2A). Accordingly, this strain presented a phenotype more responsive to relevant drugs, such as 4-NQO (Fig. 2B). This is consistent with the large decrease (Fig. 2B) in SNQ2 mRNA levels following the expression of YRM1, whereas YOR1 mRNA level was only slightly affected, consistent with the slight modification in oligomycin resistance. In the Absence of Yrr1, Yrm1 Activates the Transcription of Most of the Genes Regulated by Yrr1—Genome-wide expression analysis of a strain deleted for YRR1 and expressing YRM1 under the control of the GAL1 promoter revealed (Fig. 3A, second column) that 23 genes are significantly up-regulated;14 of them are known to be direct target genes of Yrr1, and 8 genes are specifically regulated by Yrm1. A very different situation was observed in the presence of YRR1 (Fig. 3A, first column) in which all these genes were repressed. These two situations, in which YRM1 displayed such different properties, are isogenic, differing only in terms of the presence (left) or absence (right) of YRR1. Taken at face value, this result suggests that Yrm1 and Yrr1 reciprocally inhibit each other. However, the reciprocal effect is not equivalent. The key findings may be summarized as follows: 1) YRM1 requires the total absence of YRR1 to function as an activator (Fig. 3A, **). 2) YRR1 can activate its cognate target genes even in the presence of YRM1 (Fig. 1A). 3) The overexpression of YRM1 reduces the activity of YRR1 (Figs. 2A and 3A*). The phenotype of the strains carrying the two genetic contexts is consistent with these molecular data. For instance, if Yrm1 is produced in the absence of YRR1, YOR1 is up-regulated (Fig. 3A), and the strain can grow in the presence of oligomycin (Fig. 3B). Specific Promoter Occupancy by Yrm1 in Vivo—To address the mechanism by which YRM1 activates its target genes, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out to assess the in vivo DNA binding properties of Yrm1 in the two different genetic contexts: presence and absence of YRR1. A tagged version of Yrm1, which was first demonstrated to be transcriptionally active, was trans"
https://openalex.org/W2037675234,"The SeqA protein, which prevents overinitiation of chromosome replication, has been suggested to also participate in the segregation of chromosomes in Escherichia coli. Using a bacterial two-hybrid system, we found that SeqA interacts with the ParC subunit of topoisomerase IV (topo IV), a type II topoisomerase involved in decatenation of daughter chromosomes and relief of topological constraints generated by replication and transcription. We demonstrated that purified SeqA protein stimulates the activities of topo IV, both in relaxing supercoiled plasmid DNA and converting catenanes to monomers. The same moderate levels of SeqA protein did not affect the activities of DNA gyrase or topoisomerase I. At higher levels of SeqA, topo IV favored the formation of catenanes, caused by intermolecular strand exchange among plasmid DNA aggregates formed by SeqA. Excess SeqA inhibited the activity of all topoisomerases. We also found that stimulation of topo IV was dependent upon the affinity of SeqA for DNA. Our results suggest that this stimulation is mediated by the specific interaction of topo IV with SeqA. Some of the known phenotypes of mutant cells lacking SeqA, such as deficient chromosome segregation and increased negative superhelicity, support that the SeqA protein is required for topo IV-mediated relaxation and decatenation of chromosomes and plasmids, during and after their replication. The SeqA protein, which prevents overinitiation of chromosome replication, has been suggested to also participate in the segregation of chromosomes in Escherichia coli. Using a bacterial two-hybrid system, we found that SeqA interacts with the ParC subunit of topoisomerase IV (topo IV), a type II topoisomerase involved in decatenation of daughter chromosomes and relief of topological constraints generated by replication and transcription.

Besides its role as a negative modulator of chromosome replication, the SeqA protein most likely functions in segregation of replicated DNA. Strains with seqA mutations exhibit aberrant nucleoid distribution, a higher frequency of anucleoid cells, and filamentation (11.Hiraga S. Ichinose C. Niki H. Yamazoe M. Mol.

Microscopy of immunolabeled or green fluorescent protein-tagged SeqA has revealed that SeqA is predominantly localized in foci situated at the replication forks, presumably forming complexes with the newly replicated DNA and possibly contributing to proper segregation of daughter chromosomes (4.Brendler T.

These results indicate that an optimal level of SeqA is required for the segregation of chromosomal DNA. In addition to the above mentioned phenotypes, the seqA mutant exhibits increased negative superhelicity of chromosomal and plasmid DNA as well as multimerization of plasmids (13.Weitao T.

Negative superhelicity of DNA is necessary for both DNA replication and transcription and is essential for cell viability; therefore, negative superhelicity is tightly maintained (review in Refs. 18.Kornberg A.

In E. coli, superhelicity is maintained through the balanced actions of topoisomerase I (topo I), 1The abbreviations used are: topotopoisomeraseSMDslowly migrating DNAkDNAkinetoplast DNA. DNA gyrase, and topoisomerase IV. Whereas DNA gyrase introduces negative supercoiling, topo I relaxes negative supercoils, and topo IV relaxes both positive and negative supercoils. DNA gyrase and topo IV are type II topoisomerases that change the linking number in steps of two and require ATP binding and hydrolysis for their functions. These topoisomerases introduce a transient double strand break, pass a second duplex segment through the break, and then ligate the break. The parC and parE genes encoding the subunits of topo IV are required for segregation of daughter chromosomes (22.Kato J. Nishimura Y. Yamada M. Suzuki H. Hirota Y. J.

Because topo IV is essential for cell viability, the in vivo function of topo IV has been addressed by using conditional mutants or inhibitors. Inhibition of topo IV results in increased negative superhelicity, equivalent to that of a topo I mutant, suggesting that the relaxation activities of both topo I and IV contribute to the maintenance of a certain level of negative supercoiling (27.Khodursky A.B.

In this report, we demonstrate that the SeqA protein stimulates the relaxation and decatenation activities of topo IV. The stimulation of topo IV by SeqA depends on the binding affinity of SeqA for DNA, suggesting that the binding of SeqA to DNA is involved in the stimulation.

Unless otherwise indicated, all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Bacterial Strains and Plasmid DNAs—The E. coli strains DH5α (34.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and GM3819 (dam–16:Kmr) were used for isolating plasmid DNA (DH5α for fully methylated and GM3819 for unmethylated plasmid DNA). E. coli MC1061(hsdR2 hsdM+hsdS+araD139 Δ(ara-leu)7697 Δ(lac)X74galE15 galK16 rpsL (Strr) mcrA mcrB1) was used for overproduction of topoisomerases. The plasmids pBAD18 (35.Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar) and pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene) have been previously described. The plasmid pFToriC was constructed by inserting the SmaI/BclI fragment of the E. coli oriC region into EcoRV/BamHI sites. Coding regions of topoisomerases amplified by PCR were inserted into the multiple cloning site of pBAD18 for expression. Plasmid DNAs used for supercoiling/relaxation assays were isolated by CsCl banding (34.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Proteins—Topo I, the GyrA and GyrB subunits of DNA gyrase, and the ParC and ParE subunits of topo IV were overexpressed in pBAD expression vectors (35.Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar). Overexpressed proteins were purified as described previously (26.Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

Subunits of gyrase and topo IV were mixed at equimolar concentrations then incubated on ice for 15 min to allow for holoenzyme assembly before assaying. SeqA purification has been previously described (3.Kang S. Lee H Han J.S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11463-11468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations used (unless otherwise indicated) are as follows: SeqA, 1.4 μg/μl; DNA gyrase, 0.6 μg/μl; topo I, 0.24 μg/μl; and topo IV, 0.5 μg/μl. Bacterial Two-hybrid Screening—Bacterial two-hybrid screening with the adenylate cyclase protein of Bordetella pertussis has been previously described (5.Lee H. Kang S. Bae S.H. Choi B.S. Hwang D.S.

The coding region of seqA was inserted into the KpnI/HindIII sites of the pT18 plasmid and used as bait for screening. For constructing a prey library, 0.5- to 3-kb fragments of Sau3AI partial digests of E. coli genomic DNA were ligated to the BamHI site of the pT25 plasmid; the library diversity was determined to be over 106. The pT25 genomic DNA library was electroporated into the DHP1 strain harboring pT18-seqA and plated onto LB-agar plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 10 μg/ml phosphomycin, 40 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), and 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Blue colonies were isolated, re-streaked onto plates of the same composition, and incubated at 37 °C. Single blue colonies were again selected and cultured in 3 ml of LB containing 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol to isolate prey DNA. β-Galactosidase activities were analyzed as described previously (39Miller, J. H. (, 1992) A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria, pp. 72–74, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). Generation of Un-, Hemi-, and Fully Methylated Plasmids—The Dam methylation reaction has been previously described (3.Kang S. Lee H Han J.S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11463-11468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For obtaining hemi-methylated DNA, 10 μg of unmethylated pBS or pFToriC plasmids isolated from E. coli strain GM3819 was added to 200 μl of Dam assay solution (0.1 m Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.6 μmS-adenosylmethionine) containing 0.5 μg/μl SeqA. Dam methylase (4 μg) was then added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Fully methylated plasmids were obtained by omitting SeqA from the Dam assay solution and extending the reaction time to 30 min. Topoisomerase Assays—For topoisomerase assays, the 10-μl reactions contained 50 mm Tris·HCl at pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 70 mm KCl, 1 mm ATP, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 10 ng of indicated DNA. Following addition of the topoisomerase, the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min unless indicated. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of stop solution (3% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, 15% glycerol). Products were separated through 1% agarose at 20 V for 17–20 h, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Southern hybridization, and visualized by autoradiogram. For quantification, ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences) was used. Relaxed plasmids for the DNA gyrase supercoiling assay were generated by using calf thymus topoisomerase I (Invitrogen). Relaxed plasmids were isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Preparation of Catenanes—The topo IV relaxation mixture (200 μl) contained 2 μg of hemi-methylated pFToriC, 3.6 μg of SeqA protein, and 200 ng of topo IV. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS and EDTA stop solution. DNA products were isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Agarose Gel-shift Assays—The SeqA binding mixture (10 μl), which contained the same components as the topoisomerase assay mixture, was incubated at 32 °C for 10 min. After incubation, 2 μl of 6× gelloading buffer (30% glycerol, 10 mm Tris·HCl at pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% xylene cyanol, 0.25% bromphenol blue) was added, and samples were separated through 1% agarose for 1.5 h at 50 V. Gels were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Interaction of SeqA with the C-terminal Domain of the ParC Subunit of Topo IV—Interaction between proteins can be detected with a bacterial two-hybrid system by using the functional complementation of the N (T25)- and C (T18)-terminal regions of Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase (5.Lee H.

Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1319-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). When the SeqA protein is fused to both T25 and T18, SeqA-SeqA interaction allows the reconstitution of active adenylate cyclase and results in reporter (β-galactosidase) activity 4-fold higher than the activity of the control (pT18-seqA/pT25) (Table I) (5.Lee H. Kang S. Bae S.H. Choi B.S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34600-34606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To identify the one or more proteins that interact with the SeqA protein, we used SeqA-T18 expressed from the pT18-seqA plasmid as bait. After screening an E. coli genomic library cloned into the pT25 plasmid, we identified two independent SeqA-interacting clones expressing the C-terminal regions of the ParC subunit of topo IV that interacted with SeqA (Table I). These two clones exhibited 2.3- and 2.5-fold higher β-galactosidase activities than the activity for pT25 alone.Table ISeqA interacts with the ParC subunit of topo IVRelative LacZ activitypT251pT25-seqA4pT25-parC-(310-753)2.3pT25-parC-(321-753)2.5 Open table in a new tab SeqA Stimulates the Relaxation Activity of Topo IV—Topo IV relaxes supercoils in DNA (18.Kornberg A.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2881-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of SeqA on the relaxation activity of topo IV, we examined the relaxation activity by using hemi-methylated, negatively supercoiled pBS (Fig. 1A). The unmethylated DNAs, which were used to generate hemi- and fully methylated DNAs in vitro (see “Experimental Procedures”), were isolated from dam mutant cells and therefore contained higher amounts of multimerized DNAs than DNAs obtained from wild-type cells. The relaxation reaction mixtures containing topo IV and hemi-methylated pBS were incubated for the times indicated and were then quenched with stop solution containing EDTA and SDS. The resulting topoisomers were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and detected by Southern blot hybridization (Fig. 1A). In comparison with the absence of SeqA, the presence of SeqA facilitated topo IV-mediated conversion of supercoiled plasmid to relaxed plasmid DNA. The amount of SeqA required to facilitate topo IV activity was determined by titrating SeqA into a topo IV reaction (Fig. 1B). With increasing amounts of SeqA (up to 10 nm tetramer, or the equivalent to 8 ng), the formation of relaxed DNAs was enhanced. Addition of excess SeqA (equal to or greater than 20 nm) inhibited this stimulation. In the absence of topo IV, SeqA did not alter supercoiled or relaxed DNAs (Fig. 1C). These results show that moderate levels of SeqA stimulate the relaxation activity of topo IV. SeqA Does Not Stimulate the Activity of Topo I or DNA Gyrase—To determine whether SeqA activates all topoisomerases or topo IV exclusively, we examined the effects of SeqA on the other E. coli topoisomerases, topo I, and DNA gyrase (Fig. 2). For the topo I assay, the reaction mixtures contained supercoiled, hemi-methylated plasmid DNA. The same procedure was used for the DNA gyrase assay, but relaxed, hemi-methylated plasmid was used instead of supercoiled plasmid. The relaxation activity of topo I (Fig. 2A) and the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase (Fig. 2B) were not significantly affected with up to 5 nm SeqA. As seen with topo IV, excess SeqA inhibited both DNA gyrase and topo I. This inhibition of topo I agrees with previous studies (41.Torheim N.K. Skarstad K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4882-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, stimulation by SeqA is unique to topo IV and does not occur with the other topoisomerases. SeqA Allows Topo IV to Interlink Plasmid DNAs—In the presence of SeqA, topo IV produced slowly migrating DNAs (SMDs), which were observed in the upper part of gels near the wells (Fig. 1). In contrast, addition of SeqA to either topo I or DNA gyrase reactions did not result in the production of SMDs (Fig. 2). The formation of SMDs was confirmed with hemimethylated pFToriC plasmid DNA, which contains the GATC abundant oriC region cloned into the pBS vector (data not shown). Under the reaction conditions described in Fig. 1, SeqA also stimulated the relaxation of this plasmid by topo IV. As with the relaxation activity of topo IV, the accumulation of SMDs of pFToriC occurred in a SeqA concentration-dependent manner. Topo IV converted negatively supercoiled plasmids to relaxed plasmids at lower concentrations of SeqA and to SMDs at higher concentrations. SMD formation appeared to occur more readily with pFToriC containing the abundant GATC sequences than with pBS. This preference of pFToriC caused that topo IV produced more SMDs than relaxed DNAs (Fig. 3). It is reasonable to suppose that SMDs are high molecular weight forms of DNA. Topo IV, a type II topoisomerase, cleaves both strands on duplex DNA, transiently generating 5′-ends that are covalently linked to the tyrosine residue of the enzyme (19.Wang J.C. Annu. Rev.

This covalent linkage is required for strand passage during relaxation and decatenation. These properties of topo IV indicate two possible ways in which the SMDs might be formed: 1) topo IV might be covalently cross-linked to DNA, forming a so-called protein-DNA adduct, or 2) Topo IV causes catenation, which is the reverse reaction of decatenation. To examine whether SMDs formed with hemi-methylated pFToriC are protein-DNA adducts of topo IV, SeqA, or both proteins covalently linked to DNA, the reaction mixtures containing SMDs were treated with combinations of SDS, EDTA, proteinase K, and phenol (Fig. 3A). The resistance of SMDs to all of these treatments implies that SMDs are not protein-DNA adducts. Digestion of SMDs with XhoI restriction enzyme, which cleaves one site on pFToriC, produced a unit-length of linearized pFToriC (Fig. 3B). Incubation with topo IV resolved the SMDs to relaxed DNAs (Fig. 3C). DNA gyrase, which does not effectively decatenate catenanes in vitro (28.Zechiedrich E.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 29.Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21529-21535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), did not resolve a significant amount of the SMDs. These results suggest that the SMDs generated by the cooperative action of topo IV and SeqA are interlinked plasmid DNAs, also known as catenanes, which can be resolved by topo IV, but not by DNA gyrase. Like topo IV, DNA gyrase makes a double-strand break and performs strand passage between adjacent stretches of DNA. If plasmid molecules are aggregated by spermidine, the activity of gyrase leads to intermolecular linking and catenation of the plasmid DNA (43.Kreuzer K.N. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1980; 20: 245-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Electron microscope studies have shown that binding excess SeqA to DNA results in aggregation of DNA molecules (7.Skarstad K. Lueder G. Lurz R. Speck C. Messer W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1319-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This aggregation of DNA by SeqA might explain the catenation of plasmid DNAs found in the presence of topo IV. At a certain level of SeqA, plasmid DNAs form aggregates, allowing topo IV, which in addition might be stimulated by SeqA, to carry out intermolecular strand passages between adjacent plasmids in the aggregates. This intermolecular linking catenates the aggregated plasmid DNAs. Topo IV Stimulation Is Dependent upon SeqA Affinity for DNA—Next we determined if SeqA binding to DNA is involved in the stimulation of topo IV activity (Fig. 4). Binding of SeqA to un-, hemi-, and fully methylated plasmid DNA was compared in agarose gel-shift assays (Fig. 4, A and B). Each type of plasmid bound SeqA with a different affinity. The hemi-methylated plasmid bound SeqA with the highest affinity, followed by fully methylated and then unmethylated DNA. These differences in affinity are in agreement with previous studies (4.Brendler T. Sawitzke J. Sergueev K. Austin S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6249-6258Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, SeqA facilitated the topo IV-mediated conversion of negatively supercoiled hemi-methylated DNA to the relaxed state or to catenanes (Fig. 4C). Hemimethylated substrate DNA was converted to relaxed DNA most efficiently, and unmethylated DNA was converted least efficiently. Catenane formation was most pronounced in the presence of hemi-methylated DNA, followed by fully methylated DNA. These differences in the relaxation and the formation of catenanes are comparable to the respective binding affinities of SeqA to DNAs of the three categories methylation. These results suggest that the stimulation of relaxation activity and formation of catenanes are dependent on binding of SeqA to DNA. The Decatenation of Topo IV Is Stimulated by SeqA—Topo IV possesses decatenation activity that resolves interlinked DNAs to monomers. To examine the effect of SeqA on the decatenation activity of topo IV, we treated the catenated pFToriC of Fig. 3 with topo IV and SeqA (Fig. 5A). The catenated DNAs were inefficiently detected by Southern blot analysis, because their transfer to nitrocellulose membranes is inefficient; however, decatenation could be detected by increasing the amounts of the monomer plasmids. Addition of 1.25 and 2.5 nm SeqA stimulated the conversion to monomers by topo IV. With increasing levels of SeqA, the conversion to monomers was inhibited. At more than 10 nm SeqA, further catenane formation, rather than monomerization, seemed to be favored. Kinetoplast DNA (kDNA), highly interlinked catenanes of 2.5-kb minicircles, of the insect trypanosome Crithidia fasciculate can be used as a substrate for analyzing the decatenating activity of topoisomerases (26.Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24481-24490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Sugisaki H. Ray D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 23: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Incubation of topo IV with kDNA resolved much of the interlinked DNA to monomers (Fig. 5B). Because the highly interlinked kDNA was not transferable to nitrocellulose membranes, only the decatenated DNA was detected in Southern blot analysis. In the presence of topo IV, SeqA increased the amount of resolved monomers. Without topo IV, SeqA was unable to produce monomers. SeqA seemed to stimulate the rate of decatenation as well as the total amount of monomers produced (Fig. 5C). The optimal amount of SeqA was 10 nm for decatenating 10 ng of kDNA (Fig. 5B) but 2.5 nm for decatenating 10 ng of hemi-methylated pFToriC (Fig. 5A). The insect trypanosome does not contain Dam methylase, therefore kDNA is not methylated at GATC sequences. The reason for the requirement of a greater amount of SeqA for kDNA decatenation might be the reduced affinity of SeqA for unmethylated DNA (Fig. 4, A and B). These results indicate that the process of decatenation is also dependent on the binding of the SeqA protein to DNA. We demonstrate here that both the relaxation and decatenation activities of topo IV are stimulated by the SeqA protein. Moderate levels of SeqA stimulated topo IV to convert negatively supercoiled DNA to its relaxed state (Figs. 1 and 4) and catenanes to monomers (Fig. 5). Whereas moderate levels of SeqA stimulate topo IV, DNA gyrase and topo I were not affected by similar SeqA levels, implying that the stimulation is specific to topo IV. Dependence of the stimulation upon SeqA affinity to DNA suggests that the stimulation of topo IV is mediated by the binding of SeqA to DNA. Because higher levels of SeqA cause substrate DNA to aggregate, topo IV might be able to carry out the formation of catenanes by intermolecular strand exchange between adjacent plasmid DNAs simply by virtue of aggregation. Therefore, the stimulation of the catenation activity of topo IV by SeqA might be of a passive character and due to aggregation of the DNA by SeqA. Topo IV is the principal enzyme for decatenation of replicated DNA and mutations in parC or parE, and therefore, the cause of defects in the segregation of daughter chromosomes (23.Kato J. Nishimura Y. Imamura R. Niki H. Hiraga S. Suzuki H. Cell. 1990; 63: 393-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 24.Schmid M.B. J.

Lack of topo IV activity also leads to an increase in the steady-state level of negative supercoiling because of a shift in the balance of topoisomerase activities in the cell (27.Khodursky A.B.

SeqA-deficient strains exhibit aberrant nucleoid formation, abnormal segregation of chromosomal DNA, and an increased steady-state level of negative superhelicity (11.Hiraga S. Ichinose C. Niki H.

These until now unexplained parC- and parE-like phenotypes of seqA mutants might be explained by the results we are reporting here, namely that the SeqA protein is required for proper activity of the topo IV enzyme. During replication, positive supercoils accumulate ahead of the replication fork. Relief of overwinding is necessary for progression of the replication fork, and DNA gyrase releases the increased positive superhelicity by introducing negative supercoils. Studies using topo IV-inhibiting drugs show that topo IV also participates in relieving the positive supercoils accumulated in front of replication forks. It has been proposed that part of the positive supercoils diffuses over to the replicated daughter strands behind the fork and forms positive precatenanes (21.Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar, 33.Peter B.J. Ullsperger C. Hiasa H. Marians K.J. Cozzarelli N.R.

Biol. 1999; 286: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). If the precatenanes are not effectively removed, the daughter strands are suggested to become interwound and cause barriers for progression of the replication fork and segregation of the replicated chromosomes. Topo IV activity seems to be responsible for resolving the precatenanes (20.Levine C. Hiasa H. Marians K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 21.Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar, 33.Peter B.J. Ullsperger C. Hiasa H. Marians K.J. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 819-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In an experiment in which topo IV, but not gyrase, was inhibited by norfloxacin, chromosome replication rapidly stopped in cells lacking SeqA, but did not stop in cells harboring SeqA (30.Khodursky A.B. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27668-27677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In this experiment, fork arrest was caused by the formation of topo IV-DNA adducts by the drug. This result therefore indicates that topo IV might be ahead of the forks in the absence of SeqA, but behind the forks in the presence of SeqA. ParC co-localized with the replication factory containing DNA polymerase III (47.Espeli O. Levine C. Hassing H. Marians K.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 189-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The hemi-methylated daughter strands behind the fork are normally bound by the SeqA protein (4.Brendler T. Sawitzke J. Sergueev K. Austin S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6249-6258Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). SeqA bound here might contribute to localizing ParC to the area behind the fork. This option suggests that SeqA stimulates decatenation of the positive precatenanes diffused from the front of replication fork in two ways, both by stimulating the activity and affecting the localization of topo IV. Our results suggest that the SeqA protein is involved in maintaining the integrity of replication forks throughout the replication cycle. At initiation, SeqA is involved in preventing the launch of an excessive number of forks (8.Lu M. Campbell J.L. Boye E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1994; 77: 413-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 10.Boye E. Stokke T. Kleckner N. Skarstad K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 12206-12211Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). During replication, SeqA stimulates topo IV-mediated removal of precatenanes diffused from ahead of replication forks and, at the end of replication, stimulates topo IV-mediated decatenation of newly replicated daughter chromosomes.

It consists of two domains, CopAa and CopAb, linked by two amino acids. It is found that the two domains, which had already been separately characterized, interact one to the other through a hydrogen bond network and a few hydrophobic interactions, forming a single rigid body. The two metal binding sites are far from one another, and the short link between the domains prevents them from interacting. This and the surface electrostatic potential suggest that each domain receives copper from the copper chaperone, CopZ, independently and transfers it to the membrane binding site of CopA. The affinity constants of silver(I) and copper(I) are similar for the two sites as monitored by NMR. Because the present construct “domain-short link-domain” is shared also by the last two domains of the eukaryotic copper ATPases and several residues at the interface between the two domains are conserved, the conclusions of the present study have general validity for the understanding of the function of copper ATPases.

A critical element of this fascinating machinery for copper homeostasis is represented by the P-type copper-transporting ATPases (12.Rensing C. Fan B. Sharma R. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

A peculiar feature of this kind of ATPases is that the cytoplasmic N terminus contains one or more domains with a MXCXXC metal-binding motifs, depending on the degree of evolution of the organism, i.e. superior organisms contain up to six domains, whereas in bacteria up to two domains are present (17.Arnesano F.

They all display the same overall structure, formed by two α-helices and four β-strands arranged in a classical “ferredoxin-like” βαββαβ-fold. The two cysteines of the CXXC motif are exposed on the surface of the protein readily accessible for binding the metal ion. Moreover, cytoplasmic copper chaperones such as Hah1 in humans, Atx1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and CopZ in Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus hirae bacteria, which deliver copper(I) to ATPases, share the same MXCXXC metal binding motif and the same βαββαβ-fold (21.Wernimont A.K.

Several studies are available on the human ATPases, called also Menkes and Wilson proteins (30.Lutsenko S. Efremov R.G. Tsivkovskii R. Walker J.M. J. Bioenerg.

To gain further information on this machinery we have, therefore, determined the solution structure of the N-terminal region of the copper ATPase CopA from B. subtilis, which contains two soluble metal binding domains. The solution structures of the two isolated domains are available (19.Banci L. Bertini I. Ciofi-Baffoni S. D'Onofrio M. Gonnelli L. MarhuendaEgea F.C. Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. J. Mol.

In the present study a protein segment of 151 amino acids, which contains the 2 metal binding domains and 4 other amino acids at the C terminus (CopAab hereafter), was expressed. A mutation in position 46 (S46V) was introduced to have a folded protein construct (33.Banci L. Bertini I. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Gonnelli L. Su X.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and the solution structure was solved in its apo form. The interaction with copper(I) and silver(I) has been also investigated. The structural features found here for this system most likely hold for all two domain pumps and for the two domains closest to the membrane when the domains are more than two. Cloning and Purification—The plasmid for the expression of the N-terminal region of CopA from B. subtilis was prepared as previously described (19.Banci L. Bertini I. Ciofi-Baffoni S. D'Onofrio M. Gonnelli L. MarhuendaEgea F.C. Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 415-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The single amino acid substitution was introduced using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Sequencing of the engineered DNA fragments was achieved using an automatic sequencer ABI 377. The expression and purification of the protein were performed as previously described (19.Banci L. Bertini I. Ciofi-Baffoni S. D'Onofrio M. Gonnelli L. MarhuendaEgea F.C. Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 415-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The 13C-, 15N-, and 15N-labeled proteins were obtained by growing the cells in the labeled Silantes media Escherichia coli OD2-CN and OD2-N (Silentes GmbH), respectively. Sample Preparation—As a precaution against possible disulfide formation due to the presence of CXXC motifs, the samples were prepared in a Vac atmosphere nitrogen chamber at room temperature. Protein concentrations were determined using a calculated extinction coefficient of 5360 m–1 cm–1. Circular dichroism spectra were collected on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter with a fused quartz cuvettes with a 0.1-cm path length (Merck). The NMR samples of the apo protein were in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 90% H2O, 10% D2O. The final protein concentration ranges between 1 and 1.5 mm in the presence of 2 mm dithiothreitol. Approximately 0.6 ml of sample was loaded into high quality NMR tubes that were capped with latex serum caps in the Vac Atmospheres chamber. NMR Experiments and Structure Calculations—The NMR spectra were acquired on Avance 800, 700, 600, and 500 Bruker spectrometers operating at proton nominal frequencies of 800.13, 700.13, 600.13, and 500.13 MHz, respectively. All the triple resonance (TXI 5-mm) probes used were equipped with Pulsed Field Gradients along the z axis. The 500-MHz machine was equipped with a triple resonance cryoprobe. The NMR experiments recorded on 13C,15N- and 15N-enriched and unlabeled samples are summarized in Table I.

The quality of the structures was evaluated using the programs PROCHECK-NMR (40.Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol.

Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6489) Google Scholar). Relaxation Measurements and Analysis—Relaxation experiments were collected at 298 K on a 1.5 mm sample on a Bruker Avance 600 spectrometer operating at proton nominal frequencies of 600.13 MHz. 15N R1, R2, and steady-state heteronuclear NOEs were measured with the gradient-enhanced, sensitivity-enhanced pulse sequences as described by Farrow et al. (42.Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar). R2 were measured using refocusing times (τCPMG) of 450 μs in the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) detection scheme. All experiments use the “water flipback” scheme to suppress the water signal without its saturation. A recycle delay of 3 s was used for R1 and R2. The steady state heteronuclear 1H,15N NOE was obtained by recording spectra with and without proton saturation. In the case of reference spectra without proton saturation, a relaxation delay of 6 s was employed, whereas a delay of 3 s before the proton saturation was employed for spectra with proton saturation. The latter was achieved with a train of 120° 1H pulses at 20-ms intervals. 1024 × 256 data points were collected for each map using 8 scans for each experiment. A spectral window of 40 ppm in the F1 (15N frequency) dimension and of 16 ppm in the F2 (1H frequency) dimension were used. Quadrature detection in F1 was obtained by using the TPPI method. Integration of cross-peaks for all spectra was performed by using the standard routine of the XWINNMR program. Relaxation rates R1 and R2 were determined by fitting the cross-peak intensities measured as a function of the delay within the pulse sequence to a single exponential decay. Errors on the rates were estimated through a Monte Carlo approach. Heteronuclear 1H,15N NOE values were calculated as the ratio of peak volumes in spectra recorded with and without 1H saturation. The heteronuclear 1H,15N NOE values and their errors were estimated by calculating the mean ratio and the S.E. from the available data sets. An estimate of the overall tumbling correlation time and the local correlation times for the NH vector of each residue were derived from the measured R2/R1 ratios. In this analysis care was taken to remove from the input the relaxation data of those NHs that have exchange contributions to the R2 value or which are exhibiting internal motions producing low 1H,15N NOE values. NMR Titration of the Apo Protein with Cu(I) and Ag(I)—Titrations of 15N-labeled apo protein with copper(I), added as [(CH3CN)4Cu]PF6, or silver(I), added as AgNO3, both solved in acetonitrile, were performed by monitoring the 1H,15N HSQC spectral changes upon the addition of increasing amounts of metal ions. Aliquots were added in a Coy chamber under a nitrogen atmosphere at 298 K using a Hamilton syringe to deliver small amounts of metal solution to the labeled samples in NMR tubes. The starting 15N-labeled protein samples were 1.0 or 0.5 mm in concentration. The additions range from 0.2 or 0.1 mm to 3.0 or 2.0 mm in Cu(I), and from 0.2 to 1.6 mm in Ag(I). The metal-bound content was checked through atomic absorption measurements. Three-dimensional NOESY 15N HSQC experiments were recorded on silver(I) samples with protein/metal concentration ratios of 3:1. Coordinates—The atomic coordinates and structural constraints have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1P6T). CopAab construct contains 2 domains with 40% identity and 2MXCXXC copper binding motifs separated by 68 amino acids. In vivo this construct is followed by eight transmembrane helices and by the ATP binding and the Actuator domains (30.Lutsenko S. Efremov R.G. Tsivkovskii R. Walker J.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). CopAab construct is structurally characterized in the demetalized form. NMR Structure of ApoCopAab—The resonance assignment was accomplished by the analysis of triple and double resonance experiments (Table I). 147 of the expected 151 15N backbone amide resonances were observed and assigned. The amide resonances are missing for residues Met-1, Leu-2, Ala-18, and Ala-86, as they were not determined in the separated domains (19.Banci L. Bertini I. Ciofi-Baffoni S. D'Onofrio M. Gonnelli L.

Biol. 2003; 331: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In total the resonances of 92% of carbon atoms, 96% of nitrogen atoms, and 95% of protons were assigned. These values compare well with those found for the separated domains (19.Banci L. Bertini I. Ciofi-Baffoni S. D'Onofrio M. Gonnelli L. MarhuendaEgea F.C. Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. J. Mol.

After REM on each of the 30 conformers of the family, the r.m.s.d. to the mean structure (for residues 5–143) of the conformers of the family is 0.57 ± 0.11 Å for the backbone and 0.95 ± 0.09 Å for all heavy atoms; the penalty is 0.65 ± 0.06 Å2 for distance constraints and 0.02 ± 0.01 radian2 for angle constraints. These values compare well with those of the separated domains (19.Banci L. Bertini I. Ciofi-Baffoni S. D'Onofrio M. Gonnelli L. MarhuendaEgea F.C. Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. J. Mol.

The copper binding loops are the most disordered regions besides the N and C termini. The first in sequence cysteines for each binding site, Cys-17 and Cys-85, are disordered and span variable conformations, whereas the second copper binding cysteines, Cys-20 and Cys-88, located in helices α1 and α3, respectively, have a well defined conformation, identical in both domains. The latter feature is conserved among the apo forms of the metal binding domains of ATPases for which the structure is available (18.Banci L. Bertini I. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V.

https://openalex.org/W2167010459,"When two proteins associate they form a molecular interface that is a structural and energetic mosaic. Within such interfaces, individual amino acid residues contribute distinct binding energies to the complex. In combination, these energies are not necessarily additive, and significant positive or negative cooperative effects often exist. The basis of reliable algorithms to predict the specificities and energies of protein-protein interactions depends critically on a quantitative understanding of this cooperativity. We have used a model protein-protein system defined by an affinity maturation pathway, comprising variants of a T cell receptor Vβ domain that exhibit an overall affinity range of ∼1500-fold for binding to the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin C3, in order to dissect the cooperative and additive energetic contributions of residues within an interface. This molecular interaction has been well characterized previously both structurally, by x-ray crystallographic analysis, and energetically, by scanning alanine mutagenesis. Through analysis of group and individual maturation and reversion mutations using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, we have identified energetically important interfacial residues, determined their cooperative and additive energetic properties, and elucidated the kinetic and thermodynamic bases for molecular evolution in this system. The summation of the binding free energy changes associated with the individual mutations that define this affinity maturation pathway is greater than that of the fully matured variant, even though the affinity gap between the end point variants is relatively large. Two mutations in particular, both located in the complementarity determining region 2 loop of the Vβ domain, exhibit negative cooperativity."
https://openalex.org/W1994924280,"Chromatin, a combination of nucleosomes and linker histones, inhibits transcription by blocking polymerase movement and access of factors to DNA. ATP-dependent remodeling complexes such as SWI/SNF and RSC alter chromatin structure to increase or decrease this repression. To further our understanding of how human SWI/SNF (hSWI/SNF) “remodels” chromatin we examined the octamer location, nature, and template specificity of hSWI/SNF-remodeled mononucleosomes when free or bound by linker histone H1. We find that, in the absence of H1, hSWI/SNF consistently moves nucleosomes to DNA ends, regardless of template sequence. On some sequences the repositioned histone octamer appears to be moved ∼45 bp off the DNA edge, whereas on others it appears to be normal, suggesting that the nature of the remodeled nucleosome can be influenced by DNA sequence. By contrast, in the presence of histone H1, hSWI/SNF slides octamers to more central positions and does not promote nucleosome movement off the ends of the DNA. Our results indicate that the nature and position of hSWI/SNF products may be influenced both by DNA sequence and linker histone, and shed light on the roles of H1 and hSWI/SNF in modulating chromatin structure.

Our results indicate that the nature and position of hSWI/SNF products may be influenced both by DNA sequence and linker histone, and shed light on the roles of H1 and hSWI/SNF in modulating chromatin structure. The basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosome core particle, composed of two copies each of the four core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, which wrap ∼146 bp of DNA into a left-handed superhelix. The presence of nucleosome cores on DNA blocks access to sequence-specific DNA binding factors by steric inhibition, with histone:DNA contacts occluding regulatory sites. It also inhibits movement of RNA polymerase II (1.Wolffe A.P. Essays Biochem. 2001; 37: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 2.Paranjape S.M. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 265-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In addition to core histones, the chromatin of metazoan somatic cells also contains linker histones, such as H1, which are present at a ratio of approximately one per nucleosome. H1 binds to the nucleosome core, protecting ∼10 bp of both the entering and exiting DNA, to form a structure termed the chromatosome. H1 is primarily thought to be involved in transcriptional repression. For instance, in Xenopus development the expression of H1 causes the repression of oocyte-specific 5S rDNA genes (3.Kandoldf H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7257-7260Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 4.Bouvet P. Dimitrov S. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1147-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, H1 has also been shown to be involved in transcriptional activation at certain promoters (5.Shen X. Gorovsky M.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 475-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 6.Hellauer K. Sirard E. Turcotte B. J. Biol.

H1 binding is known to promote the folding of chromatin into more compact structures, decrease nucleosome mobility, influence nucleosome positions, reduce the binding of some sequence-specific factors, inhibit core histone tail acetylation, and inhibit certain activities of chromatin remodeling complexes (8.Zlatanova J. Caiafa P. Van Holde K. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1697-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 9.Hill D.A. Imbalzano A.N.

Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It is unclear, however, exactly how each of these effects is related to transcriptional regulation. One of the mechanisms cells use to modulate the repressive effects of chromatin, is to employ a family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes. Each of these complexes has important functions in the activation and/or repression of different subsets of genes. Mutations in genes encoding remodeling complex components often result in alterations of the chromatin structure of target genes in vivo (11.Havas K. Whitehouse I. Owen-Hughes T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12.Sudarsanam P. Winston F. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 345-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 13.Urnov F.D. Wolffe A.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2991-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). One activity that appears to be shared by all remodeling complexes is the ability to translationally reposition histone octamers on DNA (14.Flaus A. Owen-Hughes T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Different complexes, however, can produce differentially positioned products (which is true even for some complexes that contain the same catalytic ATPase subunit) (15.Langst G. Bonte E.J. Corona D.F. Becker P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Nucleosome repositioning away from or over regulatory sites in chromatin is likely to be an important aspect of remodeling complex function, and differences in repositioning specificity likely contributes to the unique functions of each complex. Several important questions about octamer repositioning by ATP-dependent remodeling complexes remain unanswered, however, such as the importance of DNA sequence and structure in determining remodeled octamer positions and the effect of linker histones on repositioning. In addition to the translational repositioning of normal nucleosomes, many remodeling complexes (particularly members of the SWI/SNF subfamily) are capable of creating stable, structurally altered nucleosomal products (11.Havas K. Whitehouse I. Owen-Hughes T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 16.Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). This is evidenced by a reduction of the number of nucleosome-constrained negative supercoils, without apparent nucleosome loss, on circular polynucleosome templates (11.Havas K. Whitehouse I. Owen-Hughes T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17.Kwon H. Imbalzano A.N. Khavari P.A. Kingston R.E. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 370: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), and by the reduced stability of remodeled polynucleosomal arrays to surface deposition in atomic force microscopy studies (18.Schnitzler G.R. Cheung C.L. Hafner J.H. Saurin A.J. Kingston R.E. Lieber C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8504-8511Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Specific altered forms of mononucleosomes have also been characterized. The first such product to be identified is a structurally altered non-covalent mononucleosome dimer (11.Havas K. Whitehouse I. Owen-Hughes T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 16.Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). In addition, recent reports have shown that yeast and human SWI/SNF complexes can create structurally altered mononucleosome monomers in which both entering and exiting DNA ends appear to be held by the same histone octamer to create a loop structure (19.Kassabov S.R. Zhang B. Persinger J. Bartholomew B. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 391-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 20.Fan H.Y. He X. Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1311-1322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Altered nucleosomal products could be important for SWI/SNF complex function, because altered dimers have been shown to be more accessible than normal nucleosomes to sequence specific transcription and recombination factors (21.Schnitzler G. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 17-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 22.Kwon J. Morshead K.B. Guyon J.R. Kingston R.E. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1037-1048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The ability of certain complexes to form structurally altered products may be important for their specific functional roles in vivo. We do not know, however, how these altered products are related to other remodeling effects and whether DNA sequence or linker histones can modulate the products that are formed. We are studying the evolutionarily conserved human SWI/SNF (hSWI/SNF) 1The abbreviations used are: hSWI/SNFhuman SWI/SNFBSAbovine serum albuminDTTdithiothreitolPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayExo IIIexonuclease IIIISWIimitation switchMNasemicrococcal nuclease.1The abbreviations used are: hSWI/SNFhuman SWI/SNFBSAbovine serum albuminDTTdithiothreitolPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayExo IIIexonuclease IIIISWIimitation switchMNasemicrococcal nuclease. complex, which is essential for mammalian development and has important tumor suppressor functions (16.Kingston R.E.

Dev. 2002; 12: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). hSWI/SNF is important for transcriptional co-activation through steroid receptors and other activators, as well as co-repression through factors like the retinoblastoma protein, Rb (24.Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). We wish to understand how hSWI/SNF regulates transcription of its target genes by examining the nature of its chromatin products. hSWI/SNF generates altered nucleosome dimers from mononucleosomes and changes the supercoiling of closed-circular plasmid chromatin (17.Kwon H. Imbalzano A.N. Khavari P.A. Kingston R.E. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 370: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 21.Schnitzler G. Sif S. Kingston R.E.

Here, we use a variety of mononucleosome templates to examine octamer repositioning by hSWI/SNF. We find that repositioning favors DNA ends, ignores canonical nucleosome positioning sequences, and is persistent enough to transfer the octamer from one end of the DNA template to the other. We also find evidence for the formation of altered nucleosome monomers by hSWI/SNF. In contrast to recent observations for yeast SWI/SNF (19.Kassabov S.R. Zhang B. Persinger J. Bartholomew B. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 391-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), however, altered monomers are only formed on one end of our DNA template, with a normal nucleosome being formed on the other end, indicating that the structure of remodeled products might depend on the underlying DNA sequence. On nucleosomes containing the linker histone H1, we find that the pattern of repositioning by hSWI/SNF is altered, promoting octamer movement away from DNA ends and toward the middle of several template DNAs. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration that H1 can influence the nature and distribution of products formed by an ATP-dependent remodeling complex. DNA Fragments—The 215-bp original (+0), 215-bp +100, 265-bp, and 315-bp DNA templates were all generated by PCR using the plasmid pXP10 (27.Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1229-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) as the template. The 215-bp original fragment was amplified using primers at the EcoRI and DdeI sites, at positions –79 and +137, respectively, relative to the start site of transcription of the 5S rRNA gene. The +100 template, also 215 bp long, was derived from pXP10 using an upstream primer at –181 and a downstream primer at +34. The 265-bp template was generated using an upstream primer at –128 and the downstream DdeI primer at +137; the 315-bp fragment was amplified using the upstream –181 primer and the downstream DdeI (+137) primer. The 215-bp G5E4 template was generated from the p5SG5E4 plasmid (28.Neely K.E. Hassan A.H. Wallberg A.E. Steger D.J. Cairns B.R. Wright A.P. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 649-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), using primers at positions –177 and +36 relative to the E4 promoter start site. The DNA fragments were radiolabeled by 5′ kinase end-labeling either the upstream or downstream primer before adding it to the PCR reaction. Full-length PCR products were purified from agarose gels using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). Protein Purification—Histone H1 used in this study was purified from HeLa cells by hydroxylapatite chromatography, essentially as described (29.Utley R.T. Owen-Hughes T.A. Juan L.J. Cote J. Adams C.C. Workman J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 276-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The H1 preparation appeared to be ∼90% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. H1 concentration was determined by use of a Bio-Rad protein assay with BSA as a standard. H1 dilutions were made in BC100 buffer (100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 20% v/v glycerol) before being frozen and stored at –70 °C. Polynucleosome cores used for nucleosome assembly by octamer transfer were purified from HeLa cells as described (30.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 4. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001: 21.5.1-21.5.12Google Scholar). hSWI/SNF was purified to ∼70% homogeneity (as determined by silver staining) by affinity chromatography using the FLAG-tagged Ini1 subunit of the complex, essentially as described previously (21.Schnitzler G. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 17-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Nucleosome Reconstitution—Mononucleosomes were assembled onto end-labeled DNA fragments by octamer transfer from polynucleosome cores and salt dialysis as described (29.Utley R.T. Owen-Hughes T.A. Juan L.J. Cote J. Adams C.C. Workman J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 276-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) except that Tris-HCl was substituted for HEPES in all buffers. The nucleosomes were dialyzed in 200 volumes of dialysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol) for 4 h at 4 °C and the different mononucleosome populations separated by EMSA in 5% acrylamide gels (29:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) at 200 V in 0.5 × TBE. Bands corresponding to different mononucleosome positions were cut out and eluted overnight at 4 °C in glycerol gradient buffer (GGB, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml BSA, 5% glycerol) with rocking (31.Studitsky V.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 17-26PubMed Google Scholar). For the 315-bp template, the nucleosome mixture was separated by glycerol gradient centrifugation to purify mononucleosomes from dinucleosomes (21.Schnitzler G. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 17-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). All nucleosomes were stored at 4 °C, where they are stable for several weeks. For Fig. 4, 2 μg of PCR-amplified probe DNA was incubated with 4 μg of HeLa cell core histones (32.Workman J.L. Taylor I.C.A. Kingston R.E. Roeder R.G. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 419-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) in 220 μl of TE with 1.5 m NaCl, followed by dialysis for 1 h each into TE with 1.5, 0.93, 0.6, 0.4 m NaCl, and, finally, overnight into TE with 1 mm DTT and 0.2 mm PMSF. The assembly reaction was 55% nucleosomal, as determined by EMSA analysis. Remodeling Assays—In general, remodeling reactions contained 0.08 ng of nucleosomes (22 pm) in 25-μl reactions adjusted to 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.3 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.4 mg/ml BSA, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm DTT, 0.12 mm PMSF, and, where indicated, 2 mm ATP plus 2 mm additional MgCl2 (ATP chelates Mg2+, and the additional MgCl2 maintains the free Mg2+ concentration at 5 mm). Differences in these conditions are described in the figure legends (e.g. the nucleosome concentration in Fig. 4B was 34 nm). Note that we have found that inclusion of BSA in our nucleosome storage and hSWI/SNF reaction buffers prevents nucleosomes at low concentration from falling apart to bare DNA or changing positions (Ref. 33.Imbalzano A.N. Schnitzler G.R. Kingston R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20726-20733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar and data not shown). Where indicated, H1 was added to reactions at the concentrations noted in the figure legends. H1 has been shown to bind efficiently to nucleosomes under similar conditions (34.Hayes J.J. Lee K.M. Methods. 1997; 12: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 35.Lee K.M. Hayes J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8622-8628Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 36.Vicent G.P. Melia M.J. Beato M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 501-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Note that, due to the purification methods for positioned nucleosomes, our probe concentrations were often near or below the apparent Kd for H1 binding (estimated from titration experiments to be 100 pm or below). Thus, stoichiometric H1 binding often required H1:nucleosome ratios of greater than one (as indicated by gel shift and chromatosome stop appearance, Fig. 2). ∼300 ng of hSWI/SNF was then added, and reactions were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C and stopped by stripping hSWI/SNF and H1 from the template using competitor polynucleosomes (0.9–1.8 μg) and plasmid DNA (1–2 μg). We found that identical results were seen whether H1 was preincubated with nucleosome cores before SWI/SNF addition or added at the same time as SWI/SNF. The reactions were resolved by EMSA in 5% acrylamide gels at 200 V in 0.5 × TBE at 4 °C for ∼2.5 h after which the gel was dried and subjected to PhosphorImager analysis (AP Biotech). An alternative method for the formation of chromatosomes is to add H1 midway through the assembly process (at NaCl concentrations between 0.6 to 0.7 m). This method could not be used for studies of nucleosomes at specific positions, because 1) the gel mobility shift due to bound H1 prevented the separation of differentially positioned H1-bound nucleosomes by EMSA and 2) treatment of any singly positioned nucleosome at 0.7 m NaCl caused delocalization of the octamer to the three positions favored during assembly (e.g. see Ref. 36.Vicent G.P. Melia M.J. Beato M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 501-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar and data not shown). We do find, however, that chromatosomes formed by this method show hSWI/SNF-dependent repositioning similar to those formed by H1 addition in remodeling buffer. 2A. Ramachandran and G. R. Schnitzler, unpublished observations. For heat treatment analysis, nucleosomes were incubated for the indicated times at 60 °C in the absence of hSWI/SNF or stop solution and resolved by EMSA as above. Modifications to these general methods are noted in the figure legends. We have found that there is little change in hSWI/SNF activities when NaCl replaces KCl, when monovalent salt is between 20 and 60 mm, and when 0.1% Nonidet P-40 is added (Refs. 21.Schnitzler G. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 17-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar and 37.Phelan M.L. Schnitzler G.R. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6380-6389Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar and data not shown). Micrococcal Nuclease Analyses—For Fig. 2C, the indicated concentrations of H1 were titrated into 25-μl reactions containing 0.3 ng of purified, positioned mononucleosomes (83 pm) in standard remodeling conditions (above), except that the buffer contained 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 30 mm KCl. The tubes were incubated at room temperature for 10 min after which CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 5 mm, followed immediately by the addition of 0.59 unit of MNase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The reaction was stopped after 5 min by the addition of 25 μl of stop solution (30 mm EDTA, 0.4% SDS), followed by phenol extraction, addition of 10 μg of glycogen, ethanol precipitation, and end labeling with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The labeled DNA was separated from free [γ-32P]ATP nucleotides by passing through Bio-Spin columns (Bio-Rad), resolved by electrophoresis at 250 V in 8% acrylamide gels, and visualized by PhosphorImager analysis. For Fig. 4A, 0.3 ng of each control and remodeled nucleosomal species was digested with 0.004 unit of MNase in remodeling reaction buffer supplemented with 3 mm CaCl2, at 37 °C for 8 min, followed by DNA purification as above. Samples were then electrophoresed in a 7% acrylamide 0.5 × TBE gel, transferred to Genescreen+ nylon membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and hybridized with a 215+0 probe labeled by the random primer method (30.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 4. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001: 21.5.1-21.5.12Google Scholar). Exonuclease III Analyses—Remodeling reactions (as described above) were scaled up 8- to 16-fold (with or without 290 pm H1) and resolved by EMSA, and isolated bands were treated with Exo III essentially as described previously (38.Roberts M.S. Fragoso G. Hager G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12470-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, the appropriate bands were cut from the gel and incubated in 0.5 ml of equilibration buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 15 min while rocking, at room temperature. 50 units of Exo III (New England Biolabs) was then added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature with rocking, before being stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. The gel slices were then crushed, the tubes were spun briefly in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was carefully removed, after which the DNA was phenol-extracted, ethanolprecipitated, and resolved by electrophoresis in an 8% sequencing gel at 65-watt constant power. The gel was dried down, and the bands were visualized by using PhosphorImager analysis. Alternatively, each isolated species was eluted from the gel (as described above) and digested with a titration of Exo III, essentially as per Ref. 39.Fitzgerald D.J. Anderson J.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2526-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar except that remodeling reaction buffer (without ATP) was used. We found that 30–60 units of Exo III for 10 min at 30 °C gave digestion patterns comparable to the in situ Exo III method described above. Human SWI/SNF Moves Nucleosomes to the Ends of the DNA Template—Mononucleosome cores were assembled onto a 215-bp Xenopus somatic 5S ribosomal DNA template by histone octamer transfer from HeLa polynucleosome cores. Because a nucleosome constrains only ∼146 bp of DNA, the 215-bp template provides room for it to assume different positions on the DNA. On EMSA gels, mononucleosomes with the histone octamer in the center migrate slowly, whereas those with the octamer on a DNA end migrate rapidly (40.Duband-Goulet I. Carot V. Ulyanov A.V. Douc-Rasy S. Prunell A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 981-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 41.Meersseman G. Pennings S. Bardbury E.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 42.Kang J.G. Hamiche A. Wu C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1406-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This allowed the separation of the three major positions of assembled mononucleosomes from each other, as well as from bare DNA and HeLa polynucleosomes, by elution from EMSA gels. The EMSA mobilities of these purified, positioned nucleosomes is shown in Fig. 1 (lanes 1–3, upper, middle, and lower bands). The individual bands were incubated with hSWI/SNF in the presence or absence of ATP, after which unlabeled competitor DNA and polynucleosomes were added to remove bound hSWI/SNF and resolve mononucleosome products by EMSA. Without ATP, incubation with SWI/SNF followed by addition of competitor did not change the nucleosome mobilities (Fig. 1, lanes 4–6). However, irrespective of the initial position of the nucleosome, hSWI/SNF action in the presence of ATP always resulted in the formation of a band (RL, “Remodeled Lower”) that comigrates with input “Lower,” as well as another still lower band (Rl, “Remodeled lowest”) (Fig. 1, lanes 7–9). Altered dimers also appear to be formed on 215 5S mononucleosomes, as indicated by the appearance of products with similar relative mobility to dimers formed by yeast RSC (Remodels the Structure of Chromatin) and human SWI/SNF on a variety of other templates (Fig. 1, “Di.,” migrating about half as fast as mononucleosomes) (21.Schnitzler G. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 17-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 43.Lorch Y. Zhang M. Kornberg R.D. Mol.

Cell. 1998; 94: 29-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Addition of more hSWI/SNF reduced the levels of any remaining input band but did not otherwise change the remodeled pattern (data not shown). These results indicated that human SWI/SNF moves nucleosomes toward the DNA ends on linear mononucleosomes. Furthermore, the appearance of the Rl band indicates that the complex does not simply move nucleosomes to one of the three octamer positions favored by assembly. Histone H1 Causes hSWI/SNF to Move Nucleosomes to Central Positions—Because H1-containing chromatin is likely to be the in vivo substrate for mammalian remodeling complexes, it is critical to understand how H1 affects the remodeling reaction. Previous studies have examined the effect of H1 on yeast and human SWI/SNF-mediated changes in the DNase pattern of mononucleosomes and enhancement of restriction enzyme accessibility on mononucleosomes and polynucleosomal arrays (9.Hill D.A. Imbalzano A.N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11649-11656Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 10.Horn P.J. Carruthers L.M. Logie C. Hill D.A. Solomon M.J. Wade P.A. Imbalzano A.N. Hansen J.C. Peterson C.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To better understand how hSWI/SNF might modulate the structure of H1-containing chromatin in vivo, we wished to determine the effect of H1 on hSWI/SNF-facilitated nucleosome repositioning and altered dimer formation. Unlike the core histones, H1 can bind specifically to preformed mononucleosome cores at physiological salt concentrations (34.Hayes J.J. Lee K.M. Methods. 1997; 12: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 35.Lee K.M. Hayes J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8622-8628Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 36.Vicent G.P. Melia M.J. Beato M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 501-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This allowed us to study the effect of hSWI/SNF on single-position nucleosomes bound by H1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). We titrated HeLa cell H1 into reactions containing purified, positioned nucleosomes to establish conditions for chromatosome formation. Stoichiometric binding of H1 to cores causes a distinct gel mobility shift (e.g. see Refs. 34.Hayes J.J. Lee K.M. Methods. 1997; 12: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Sch"

The enzymatic degradation of heme by a microsomal enzyme, heme oxygenase (HO), 1The abbreviations used are: HOheme oxygenaseCOcarbon monoxideGSTglutathione S-transferaseCMVcytomegalovirus.1The abbreviations used are: HOheme oxygenaseCOcarbon monoxideGSTglutathione S-transferaseCMVcytomegalovirus. was first characterized by Tenhunen et al. (1Tenhunen R. Marver H.S. Schmid R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 748-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar). The isoenzymes HO-1 (the inducible form) and HO-2 (the constitutive form) have been attributed antioxidant, cytoprotective, neurotransmitter, and anti-inflammatory functions (2Applegate L.A. Luscher P. Tyrrell R.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 974-978PubMed Google Scholar, 3Maines M.D. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2557-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1556) Google Scholar, 4Vile G.F. Basu-Modak S. Waltner C.

Invest. 1998; 101: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) among others. A third isoform HO-3 is less well understood. In the reaction catalyzed by HO, heme is degraded to generate equimolar quantities of iron, biliverdin, and carbon monoxide (CO) (see Fig. 1). All of these reaction substrates are unique in that they are pro-oxidants (heme and iron) or antioxidants (biliverdin) or signaling molecules (CO and biliverdin). Both isoenzymes of HO degrade heme at the α-meso bridge. Why there is redundancy of the heme-degradative function is not well understood, but as with nitric-oxide synthase (6Kone B.C. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 51: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 7Mehta J.L. Chen L.Y. Kone B.C. Mehta P. Turner P. J. Lab., Clin. Med. 1995; 125: 370-377PubMed Google Scholar), there are differences in the function of the HO isoenzymes? The HO-1 form is inducible by a wide variety of stresses including oxidative, heavy metal, and inflammation (2Applegate L.A. Luscher P. Tyrrell R.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 974-978PubMed Google Scholar, 3Maines M.D. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2557-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1556) Google Scholar, 4Vile G.F. Basu-Modak S. Waltner C. Tyrrell R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2607-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The HO-2 isoenzyme is largely constitutive and also serves as a heme-binding protein (8Maines M.D. Trakshel G.M.

In most tissues, there is variable abundance of each HO isoenzyme. The spleen has increased abundance of HO-1 protein (11Rodgers P.A. Stevenson D.K. Clin. Perinatol. 1990; 17: 275-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the brain expresses mostly HO-2 protein (12Sun Y. Rotenberg M.O. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8212-8217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although there is differential distribution of HO-1 and HO-2 within tissues, the two isoenzymes can also co-localize. In the brain, expression of HO-1 protein was observed in the neurons from the hypothalamus, cerebellum, and brain stem (13Vincent S.R. Das S. Maines M.D. Neuroscience. 1994; 63: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The distribution of HO-2 was more widespread and included pyramidal, granule, and endothelial cells (13Vincent S.R. Das S. Maines M.D. Neuroscience. 1994; 63: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In null mutant mice for the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene product, HO-1 and HO-2 immunoreactive proteins showed increased expression and were co-localized to the Purkinje and endothelial cells of the cerebellum of 2-month-old animals as compared with wild type controls (14Barlow C. Dennery P.A. Shigenaga M.K. Smith M.A. Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Wynshaw-Boris A. Levine R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9915-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In rat lung tissue slices, HO-1 and HO-2 immunoreactive signals co-localize in the bronchioalveolar epithelium and vascular smooth muscle cells throughout development (15Dennery P.A. Lee C.S. Ford B.S. Weng Y.H. Yang G. Rodgers P.A. Pediatr. Res. 2003; 53: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). HO-1 predominates in alveolar macrophages, whereas HO-2 is expressed in the vascular smooth muscle but is also found in alveolar macrophages (16Maestrelli P. El Messlemani A.H. De Fina O. Nowicki Y. Saetta M. Mapp C. Fabbri L.M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 164: 1508-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Further documentation of co-localization of HO-1 and HO-2 to the endothelium has been published previously (17Marks G.S. McLaughlin B.E. Vreman H.J. Stevenson D.K. Nakatsu K. Brien J.F. Pang S.C. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1997; 30: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Co-localization of proteins does not necessarily imply that the proteins interact functionally but this occurs in many cases. For example, the proximity of two proteins may allow for transfer of energy as in the case of phosphofructokinase-1 and the “a” subunit of the proton pump. This serves to link the proton pump and glycolysis (18Su Y. Zhou A. Al-Lamki R.S. Karet F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20013-20018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In another example, carbonic anhydrase II binds to the mammalian Na+/H+ exchanger, enhancing its efficiency (19Li X. Alvarez B. Casey J.R. Reithmeier R.A. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36085-36091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Earlier evidence to suggest that HO-1 and HO-2 protein could interact is indicated in the first description of HO-1 purification where a 68-kDa protein was identified (20Maines M.D. Ibrahim N.G. Kappas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5900-5903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is now known that the molecular mass of HO-1 is 32 and HO-2 36 kDa. It could be that a complex of the two proteins was initially isolated under partially denaturing conditions. Therefore, we hypothesized that there is a physical interaction between HO-1 and HO-2 proteins. In other systems, such interactions may modify protein function. If HO-1 binding to HO-2 alters HO activity, the relative abundance of HO-1 to HO-2 may modulate the effects of HO in the various tissues. Using several methods, an interaction between HO-2 and HO-2 was demonstrated. We also show the effect of the HO-1·HO-2 protein complex on HO activity. Yeast Two-hybrid Interaction of HO-1 and HO-2—The yeast strain Y187 (Matchmaker GAL4, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was grown in YPD (yeast extract/peptone/dextrose) adjusted to pH 5.8 with 2% glucose. The HO-1 and HO-2 fusions were formed by ligation of HO-1 and HO-2 rat cDNA with pAS2-1 and pACT2 vectors, respectively. More specifically, 100 ng of HO cDNA was incubated for 30 min with 0.1 mg of carrier DNA (herring testis DNA). Yeast cells were heat-shocked at 42 °C and then chilled and centrifuged at 10,000 × g. The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 0.1 mm Tris, pH 8, and 0.1 mm EDTA and plated on selection medium (synthetic dropout agar) at 30 °C for 2-4 days. In some experiments, HO-1 was used as the bait protein (GAL4 DNA-binding domain) for HO-2 (GAL4 activating domain protein) and, in other circumstances, HO-2 was used as bait for HO-1. Yeast colonies transformed with the fusion plasmids were selected by culture on synthetic medium lacking tryptophan (for selection of the DNA-binding domain plasmid), leucine (for selection of the activating domain plasmid), or both (for selection of both plasmids). Determination of HO protein interactions was achieved by measuring LacZ reporter gene expression using β-galactosidase activity with the colony-lift filter method according to the manufacturer's (Clontech) protocol. A positive control encoding for the full-length GAL4 protein (pCL1) was used. Additionally, pVA3-1 and pTD1-1 as DNA-binding domain and activating domain fusion plasmids were used to document a positive interaction of proteins by the yeast two-hybrid assay. Coimmunoprecipitation of HO-1 and HO-2—An in vitro transcription/translation reaction with pRC-CMV/HO-2 was performed using the TnT T7 Quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI) and Redivue l-[35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) yielding 35S-labeled HO-2. Extracts from cells transfected with pRC-CMV/HO-1 were incubated at room temperature overnight with HO-1 antibody and the 35S-labeled HO-2. The mixture was passed through the HiTrap™ protein A purification column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was then washed with 5 ml of start buffer (containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7), eluted with 50 μl elution buffer (containing 0.1 m citric acid, pH 5), and electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was vacuum-dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) Fusion Protein Pull Down of HO-1 and HO-2—A rat HO-1-GST fusion protein was constructed by inserting the HO-1 cDNA into the BamHI-XhoI site of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The construct was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells (Invitrogen) using 200 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. Transfected E. coli cell sonicates were added to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B MicroSpin column (Amersham Biosciences) at room temperature for 10 min. After centrifuging and washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, the column was incubated with 250 μl of 35S-labeled HO-2 protein at room temperature overnight. The purified GST-HO-1 fusion protein on the column was then washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline, eluted with 100 μl of glutathione elution buffer containing 10 mm reduced glutathione, and run on a 12% SDS-PAGE as described above. The gel was dried and developed on Kodak X-Omat AR film. The presence of a radioactive signal was determined by autoradiography. In other experiments, a GST-HO-2 fusion protein was incubated with the glutathione-Sepharose column and incubated with 35S-labeled HO-1. The column was washed and eluted as above. Construction of Deletion Mutants of HO-2 to Determine the Region of Binding to HO-1—Deletion analysis was used to identify the area of binding of HO-1 on HO-2. 35S-Labeled in vitro translated full-length HO-1 was incubated with GST-HO-2 fusion products of various lengths and passed onto a GST column.

The primer 5′-CCGGAAGGGGGCGTTGCTGCCTCC-3′, complementary to nucleotides 442-464 with mismatches to convert His-151 to alanine, was also used as described previously (9McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Huang T.J. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12568-12574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) The mutations were produced with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutated cDNA products were sequenced to verify that the appropriate mutation had been produced. Thereafter, the cDNA clones were ligated into the PGEX4T-1 vector at the BamH1 and XhoI sites. Construction of Deletion Mutants of HO-1 to Determine the Region of Binding to HO-2—In other experiments, various HO-1 constructs of differing lengths were PCR-amplified using the sense primer 5′-TATGGATCCATGGAGCGCCCACAGCTCGA-3′ and the antisense primers described in Table II.

The 35S-labeled products were then incubated with GST-labeled full-length HO-2 and eluted onto a GST column as described above. The binding of HO-1 fragments to HO-2 was evaluated by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described above. Evaluation of an HO-1·HO-2 Complex in Native Gels—5 μg each of GST-purified, thrombin-cleaved HO-1 and HO-2 proteins in 10 μl of phosphate-buffered saline were co-incubated at room temperature for 8 h. Samples were mixed with non-denaturing loading buffer (lacking reducing agents sodium dodecyl sulfate or mercaptoethanol) and electrophoresed onto a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel at pH 8.8. Gels were electrophoresed under non-denaturing conditions, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed for HO-1 and HO-2 immunoreactive proteins by Western analysis as described previously (21Weng Y.H. Tatarov A. Bartos B.P. Contag C.H. Dennery P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L1273-L1279PubMed Google Scholar). The gel was then stained with Coomassie Blue. Determining the Effects of HO-1·HO-2 Protein Complex on HO Activity—In vitro translated HO-1 and HO-2 (1 μg each in 0.1 m phosphate buffer pH 7.4) were combined at differing ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 2:1, and 3:1 of HO-1 to HO-2) in the presence of excess hemin (150 mm, Sigma), NADPH (10 mm, Sigma), and cytochrome c P450 reductase (1 μm, Stressgen, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada), an enzyme that participates in the HO reaction by providing reducing equivalents. Total HO activity was determined by gas chromatography and expressed as nmol CO/mg protein/h (22Vreman H.J. Stevenson D.K. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In some experiments, 20 μl of spleen homogenate (predominantly composed of HO-1) from C57BL/6 mice were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 0-25 μg in vitro translated HO-2 to determine the effect of HO protein binding on total HO activity in tissues. In other experiments, 20 μl of brain homogenates (predominantly HO-2) from C57BL/6 or HO-2 knock-out mice were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 0-25 μg of pure rat HO-1 protein. Total heme oxygenase activity of the mixture was measured. Lastly, 20 μl of brain homogenates from C57Bl/6 were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 12.5 μg of HO-1 fragment, which binds to HO-2. Total HO activity was then measured. Defining an Interaction between HO-1 and HO-2 Proteins— Several approaches were used to demonstrate that HO-1 binds to HO-2. 1) The specific interaction of HO-1 and HO-2 proteins was confirmed by co-transformation of both pAS2-1/HO-1 and pACT2/HO-2 into Y187 cells to reconstruct the GAL4 transcription activity. Additionally, GAL4 transcription activity was confirmed with the reverse reaction, namely pAS2-1/HO2 and pACT2/HO2 in the Y187 cells (Table III). 2) Recovery of [35S]HO-2 was demonstrated after incubation with GST-HO-1 fusion protein, elution on a glutathione column, and separation by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). The reverse process, namely the recovery of 35S-labeled HO-1 with HO-2-GST fusion protein, was also successfully observed (Fig. 2). 3) In vitro translated 35S-labeled HO-2 was recovered after incubation with extracts from NIH 3T3 cells transfected with pRC-CMV/HO-1 and immunoprecipitation with HO-1 antibodies (Fig. 3). 4) The appearance of an additional band on a non-denaturing gel after incubation of purified HO-1 and HO-2 proteins was documented. Incubation with anti-HO-1 and anti-HO-2 antibodies verified that the new band had both HO-1 and HO-2 immunoreactivity. This finding demonstrates the formation of an HO-1·HO-2 protein complex (Fig. 4A). Incubation of HO-2 with either GST-purified full-length HO-1 (fl) or rat HO-1 from E. coli where the membrane binding domain has been truncated (tr) resulted in an HO-1/2 immunoreactive complex (Fig. 4B). However, the signal intensity of the complex was enhanced when the soluble rat HO-1 protein was added to HO-2 (Fig. 4B). This suggests that the soluble form of HO-1 is more likely to bind to HO-2. 5) When spleen was incubated with purified HO-2, a new HO-1 and HO-2 immunoreactive band was observed. This band increased in intensity with increasing amounts of HO-2 (Fig. 5, A and B). 6) When brain tissue was incubated with purified GST-HO-1 and electrophoresed on a native gel, a new HO-1 and HO-2 immunoreactive band was observed. This band increased in HO-1 signal intensity with the addition of increasing amounts of HO-1 protein (Fig. 6, A and B). The signal intensity of HO-2 diminished with the addition of purified HO-1, suggesting that the HO-2 antigenic site may have been obscured by complexation of HO-1 with HO-2 (Fig. 6B).Table IIIVerification of an HO-1 and HO-2 protein interaction with the yeast two-hybrid systemYeast coloniesβ-Galactosidase activitypVA3 + pTD (positive control)++pACT2/HO-2 + pAS2-1/HO-1+pACT2 + pAS2-1/HO-1−pACT2/HO-2 + pAS2-1− Open table in a new tab Fig. 3Co-immunoprecipitation of HO-1 and HO-2 proteins.

Using deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified the area of binding of HO-2 on HO-1 and vice versa. Truncating the HO-1 protein from the C-terminal did not alter the binding to HO-2. A loss of the first 80 amino acids resulted in a loss of binding, but a truncated protein of 0-67 amino acids from the N terminus retained the HO-2 binding. In contrast, a protein of 0-58 amino acids from the N terminus did not retain the binding ability. Based on these observations, we deduce that the binding region of HO-1 to HO-2 resides in amino acids 58-80. (Table IV.) These residues correspond to a portion of the C-helix and loop of HO-1 protein (see Table VI).Table IVDeletion analysis to identify the binding region of GST-HO-1 fragments to 35S-HO-2 Open table in a new tab Table VIAmino acid sequence of human, mouse, and rat HO proteins Open table in a new tab With HO-2, modifying Cys-126 or His-151 did not alter HO-1/HO-2 binding. This suggests that the binding does not involve sulfhydryl groups or the putative heme regulatory motif suggested by McCoubrey et al. (9McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Huang T.J. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12568-12574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Truncating the HO-2 protein from the C terminus did not result in the loss of binding. However, when amino acids 0-45 were deleted from the HO-2 protein, binding to HO-1 was eliminated (Table V.) This region is immediately adjacent to His-45, which is also thought to be a heme regulatory motif (Table VI).Table VDeletion analysis to identify the binding region of 35S-HO-2 fragments to GST-HO-1 Open table in a new tab Determination of the Enzymatic Activity of the HO-1·HO-2 Protein Complex—Several strategies were employed to evaluate the effect of HO-1·HO-2 on total HO activity as follows. 1) The addition of increasing concentrations of in vitro translated HO-2 to in vitro translated HO-1 protein in the presence of excess substrate and cofactors did not increase the total HO activity of the solution. In fact, at the highest concentrations, a decrease in activity was noted suggesting inhibition of HO-1 activity with HO-2 (Fig. 4C). 2) When mouse spleen homogenate (predominantly HO-1) was combined with in vitro translated HO-2, total HO activity increased at the lowest concentration but decreased as more HO-2 was added, suggesting competitive inhibition (Fig. 5C). 3) When mouse brain homogenate (predominantly HO-2) was combined with in vitro translated HO-1, HO activity increased initially but then decreased with the addition of increasing concentrations of HO-1 (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, the levels of HO activity achieved with the addition of HO-1 to HO-2 knock-out mice brain were significantly higher than those observed in WT control (Fig. 6D) and the addition of higher concentrations of HO-1 protein to these samples resulted in decreased HO activity (Fig. 6D). 4) The addition of a fragment necessary for HO-1 binding to HO-2 (amino acids 0-117 of HO-1) to the brain homogenates significantly reduced total HO activity of the complex (decreased to 0.23 ± 0.03 versus 0.36 ± 0.04 nmol CO/mg protein/h in samples incubated with 0-117 fragment versus brain homogenates alone). Values are the mean ± S.E. of four separate experiments (p < 0.05). Using multiple methods, we have described a novel interaction between HO-1 and HO-2 proteins in cell-free systems and in tissues. Also, with GST fusion assays, we were able to determine that the binding involves the first 44 amino acids of HO-2 and involves amino acids 58-80 of HO-1. In the case of HO-2, the loss of binding to HO-1 occurred if residues 0-44 were removed. This location is proximal to His-45. This residue is involved in heme binding and HO catalytic activity as described by Ishikawa et al. (23Ishikawa K. Sato M. Ito M. Yoshida T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Others had implicated His-152 of HO-2 as the heme catalytic site and showed that mutation of His-152 to Ala results in the generation of both the active and inactive 33-kDa HO-2 fragments (9McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Huang T.J. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12568-12574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In our experiments, mutation of this residue did not alter HO-1 binding to HO-2. Because of the proximity of the binding region for HO-1 to a putative heme binding site of HO-2, the binding of HO-1 to HO-2 may alter the ability of HO-2 to bind to heme. The C helix of HO-1 is a stable region that does not fluctuate between the apo- and the heme-bound HO-1 state (24Sugishima M. Omata Y. Kakuta Y. Sakamoto H. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K.

Furthermore, in the identified HO-1 region of binding, the residues are highly conserved, hydrophilic, and exposed to the protein surface. The loss of amino acids 58-80 on HO-1 should not alter the heme pocket or modify heme catalysis. Nonetheless, it is possible that binding of a relatively large protein such as HO-2 in this location could modify HO-1 protein charge and configuration, resulting in deformation of the heme pocket. This could explain the relative loss of HO activity in the presence of the HO-1·HO-2 complex. None of the distal residues of HO-1 or HO-2 appears to be involved in this HO-1·HO-2 binding. These have been implicated in proper HO-1 function, and they also form the distal heme binding pocket (24Sugishima M. Omata Y. Kakuta Y. Sakamoto H. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 25Sugishima M. Sakamoto H. Kakuta Y. Omata Y. Hayashi S. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7293-7300Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For example, amino acids 134-136, 142, and 147 all directly contact heme but they do not appear to be important in the binding of HO-1 to HO-2 because truncated forms eliminating these amino acids did not result in modified binding to HO-2. There is a positive electrostatic potential around the hydrophobic heme pocket of the human HO-1 protein, which could repel other proteins and prevent binding (26Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the amino acids in the initial portion of rat HO-2 (0-44 amino acids) are largely hydrophilic and thus could interact with the amino acids from the helix C in HO-1 that are equally hydrophilic. Because of the lack of an available crystal structure for HO-2, it is not yet possible to further define the region of binding of HO-1 to HO-2. As stated, the proximity of HO-1 binding to the His-45 in HO-2 could limit accessibility of heme to the heme binding pocket and affect HO activity. In addition, one heme molecule could be shared or sequestered by HO-1 and HO-2, thereby limiting HO activity. In fact, HO activity was significantly decreased in the presence of the complex. This was demonstrated both with in vitro generated protein in the presence of excess cofactors as well as in tissues such as the spleen and the brain with relative abundance of HO-1 and HO-2, respectively. There are other examples of enzymes binding to proteins, thereby modifying the enzyme activity. For example, p53 protein binds to the ribonucleotide reductase subunit HRRM2, resulting in increased reductase activity as shown by increased nuclear translocation (27Xue L. Zhou B. Liu X. Qiu W. Jin Z. Yen Y. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 980-986PubMed Google Scholar). In another example, carbonic hydrase binds to and enhances the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger (19Li X. Alvarez B. Casey J.R. Reithmeier R.A. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36085-36091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This is done by binding at the N terminus of both proteins and occurs after phosphorylation (19Li X. Alvarez B. Casey J.R. Reithmeier R.A. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36085-36091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The HO-2 protein can also phosphorylated, rendering it more active (28Dore S. Takahashi M. Ferris C.D. Zakhary R. Hester L.D. Guastella D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2445-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Whether phosphorylation or hypophosphorylation modifies the formation and activity of the HO-1·HO-2 binding complex is not known at this time. In other examples, protein interactions allow for an approximation of proteins of a similar metabolic pathway leading to the formation of a “metabolon,” facilitating energy provision such as with H+-ATPase and phosphofructokinase 1 (18Su Y. Zhou A. Al-Lamki R.S. Karet F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20013-20018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the case of HO-1 and HO-2, the interaction did not enhance HO activity but rather suppressed it. The regulation of HO enzyme activity by HO-1 binding to HO-2 could represent a useful negative feedback mechanism for limiting HO activity when there is excess HO protein. Overexpression of HO activity in the higher range (greater than 5-fold) has deleterious effects (29Suttner D.M. Dennery P.A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1800-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), whereas at low concentrations, HO activity is cytoprotective in most models (4Vile G.F. Basu-Modak S. Waltner C. Tyrrell R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2607-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 30Suttner D.M. Sridhar K.J. Lee C.S. Tamura T. Hansen T.N. Dennery P.A. Am. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14937-14942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Maintaining HO activity within a narrow range could provide protection against acute changes in HO-1 expression with various inducers. We suspect that in tissues where HO-1 and HO-2 co-localize such as the lung and the brain, HO activity is modulated by the HO complex. The lung is particularly susceptible to oxidant stress because of its direct exposure to environmental toxicants. Overexpression of HO beyond a certain threshold may be detrimental because of the release of redox active iron (29Suttner D.M. Dennery P.A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1800-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 32Dennery P.A. Visner G. Weng Y.H. Nguyen X. Lu F. Zander D. Yang G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Allowing HO activity to remain in the cytoprotective range would be desired. This could be accomplished by the formation of the HO complex. In summary, we demonstrate an interaction between HO-1 and HO-2 proteins using various methods and we suggest that this interaction serves to limit HO activity in certain tissues where the two co-enzymes co-localize. This negative regulation of HO activity may be important to ensure a cytoprotective range of HO expression. We thank Dr. Paul Ortiz de Montellano for invaluable expertise and helpful suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W2038676896,"The homeodomain proteins, HoxA10 and Pbx1a, interact with negative cis elements to repress gene transcription in undifferentiated myeloid cells. The CYBB and NCF2 genes, which encode the gp91PHOX and p67PHOX proteins, are two such HoxA10-Pbx1a target genes. In previous studies, we found that HoxA10-Pbx1a represses transcription of these genes by two mechanisms: competition for DNA binding with transcriptional activators and endogenous repression activity. In these studies, we identify a novel molecular mechanism of endogenous transcriptional repression by HoxA10-Pbx1a. Endogenous repression activity of other Hox-Pbx1a complexes requires recruitment of transcriptional co-repressor proteins by Pbx1a. In contrast, our investigations have determined that HoxA10 has Pbx1a-independent endogenous repression activity. We find that this transcriptional repression activity is abrogated by histone deacetylase inhibitors, suggesting involvement of co-repressor proteins. Consistent with this, we identify HoxA10 amino acids 224–249 as a Pbx1-independent repression domain, which interacts with histone deacetylase 2. We have determined that this HoxA10 domain is not conserved with other Abd Hox proteins, although homology exists with other transcription factors and co-repressors. Understanding the roles different Hox proteins play in myeloid differentiation is a challenging problem. Our results suggest that insight into this problem can be obtained from biochemical characterization of the various molecular mechanisms of Hox protein function.

Understanding the roles different Hox proteins play in myeloid differentiation is a challenging problem. Our results suggest that insight into this problem can be obtained from biochemical characterization of the various molecular mechanisms of Hox protein function. Hox proteins are homeodomain transcription factors that play a crucial role in hematopoiesis. Genes encoding Hox proteins are organized in four paralog groups (A–D) on four chromosomes (1Acampora D. D'Esposito M. Faiella A. Pannese M. Migliaccio E. Morelli F. Stornaiuolo A. Nitro V. Simeone A. Boncinelli A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10385-10400Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Hox expression is tightly regulated during embryonic and definitive hematopoiesis (1Acampora D. D'Esposito M. Faiella A. Pannese M. Migliaccio E. Morelli F. Stornaiuolo A. Nitro V. Simeone A. Boncinelli A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10385-10400Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Specifically, Hox 1–4 are expressed in hematopoietic stem cells, whereas committed myeloid progenitors express the Abd HoxA proteins 9–13 (2Sauvageau G. Lansdorp P.M. Eaves C.J. Hogge D.E. Dragowska W.H. Reid D.S. Largman C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12223-12227Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). A number of investigations suggest that tight regulation of Hox expression is necessary for normal hematopoiesis. For example, overexpression of HoxB4 in murine bone marrow cells results in CD34+ cell expansion ex vivo and induces myeloid leukemia in mice in the presence of overexpressed Pbx1a (3Sauvageau G. Thorsteindottir U. Eaves C.J. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Lansdorp P.M. Humphries R.K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1753-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 4Krosl J. Banban S. Krosl G. Rosenfeld S. Largman C. Sauvageau G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3403-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast, HoxA9 overexpression immortalizes committed murine myeloid progenitor cells, ex vivo (5Clavo K.R. Sykes D.B. Pasillas M. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3274-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In the presence of overexpression of either Pbx1a or Meis1 proteins, HoxA9 overexpression leads to murine myeloid leukemia (6Kasper L.H. Brindle P.K. Schnabel C.A. Pritchard C.E. Cleary M.L. Van Deursen J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 764-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 7Kroon E. Krosl J. Thorsteindottir U. Banban S. Buchberg A.M. Sauvageau G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3714-3725Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Similarly, HoxA10 overexpression immortalizes murine bone marrow myeloid cells, ex vivo. However, HoxA10 overexpression in murine bone marrow induces myeloid leukemia, independent of Pbx1a (8Thorsteindottir U. Sauvageau G. Hough M.R. Dragowska W. Lansdorp P.M. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Humphries R.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Pbx and Meis proteins increase the DNA binding affinity of various Hox proteins (9Chang C.P. Brocchieri L. Shen W.F. Largman C. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1734-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). However, Pbx1a also interacts directly with transcriptional co-repressor proteins (10Asahara H. Dutta S. Kao H.-Y. Evans R.M. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8219-8225Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), indicating a number of potential functional activities in Hox-containing protein complexes.Functional disparities suggest that Hox proteins are not redundant during myelopoiesis. Such differences could be due to variable target gene affinities. Consistent with this, binding site selection assays document different DNA-binding affinities among Hox proteins, despite highly conserved homeodomains (9Chang C.P. Brocchieri L. Shen W.F. Largman C. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1734-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Further studies indicate that, similar to homologous Drosophila Homc proteins (11Pinsonneault J. Florence B. Vaessin J. McGinnis W. EMBO J. 1997; 8: 2032-2042Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar), Hox proteins function as transcriptional activators or repressors, depending on context. For example, a HoxB1-Pbx1a complex either activates or represses transcription of artificial promoter constructs (12Saleh M. Rambaldi I. Yang X.J. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8623-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Activation requires HoxB1 recruitment of CBP (12Saleh M. Rambaldi I. Yang X.J. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8623-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In contrast, repression of the HOXB1 promoter by HoxB1 requires recruitment of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), 1The abbreviations used are: HDAC1 and -2histone deacetylase 1 and 2, respectivelyaaamino acidsIFNγinterferon-γEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assay(s)TSAtrichostatin AGSTglutathione S-transferase.1The abbreviations used are: HDAC1 and -2histone deacetylase 1 and 2, respectivelyaaamino acidsIFNγinterferon-γEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assay(s)TSAtrichostatin AGSTglutathione S-transferase. Sin3a, NCoR-1, and SMRT by the Hox-Pbx complex (12Saleh M. Rambaldi I. Yang X.J. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8623-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).We previously found that HoxA10-Pbx1a represses transcription of the CYBB and NCF2 genes, via cis elements homologous to derived Hox-Pbx consensus sequences (13Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The CYBB and NCF2 genes, which encode the respiratory burst oxidase proteins gp91PHOX and p67PHOX, are expressed in differentiating myeloid cells after the promyelocyte stage (14Newburger P.E. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Whitney C. Wright J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5215-5220Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Leto T.L. Lomax K.J. Volpp B.D. Nunio H. Sechler J.M.G. Nauseef W.M. Clark R. Gallin J.I. Malech H.L. Science. 1990; 248: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). We found HoxA10-Pbx1a binds the CYBB and NCF2 cis elements, in undifferentiated myeloid cells and prevents DNA binding of transcriptional activators to positive cis elements, immediately adjacent in the promoters (27Eklund E.A. Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 15: 2418-2430Google Scholar). However, we also found that HoxA10, expressed as a fusion protein with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, represses an artificial promoter containing GAL4 DNA-binding sites (13Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, we identified two mechanisms for HoxA10-Pbx1a repression of these genes: competition with transcriptional activators and endogenous repression activity (13Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We found that HoxA10-binding affinity to the CYBB and NCF2 genes is decreased by HoxA10 tyrosine phosphorylation (13Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Since HoxA10 is tyrosine-phosphorylated during differentiation, this provides a mechanism regulating repression activity during myelopoiesis (16Eklund E.A. Goldenberg I. Lu Y. Andrejic J. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36878-36888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Functional differences between Hox proteins could reflect variable mechanisms of transcriptional repression or activation. In the current studies, we find that, in contrast to previously described Hox proteins, HoxA10 transcriptional repression is Pbx1a-independent. We identify a novel transcriptional repression domain in HoxA10 that interacts with HDAC2 and has homology to domains in other transcriptional repressor and co-repressor proteins. These results suggest that various Hox proteins participate in different protein-protein interactions, which may confer some of the dissimilarity of function between these proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids and PCR Mutagenesis—Artificial promoter/reporter constructs were generated as previously described (13Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) in the minimal promoter/reporter vector, p-TATACAT (17Scholer H.R. Balling R. Hazopoulos A.K. Suzuki N. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2551-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) (obtained from Dr. A. Kraft, University of Colorado, Denver). Constructs were generated with four copies (in the forward direction) of the –94 to –134 bp sequence from the CYBB promoter (p-cybbTATACAT). This CYBB promoter sequence has previously been demonstrated to function as a repressor element in myeloid cell lines (13Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).The cDNA for human HoxA10 was obtained from C. Largman (University of California, San Francisco) (18Lowney P. Corral J. Detmer K. Le Beau M.M. Deaven L. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3443-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This cDNA sequence represents the major transcript in mammalian hematopoietic cells, encoding a 393-amino acid, 55-kDa protein (19Takebe Y. Seki M. Fujisajwa J.-I Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K.-I. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type HoxA10 cDNA sequence was subcloned into the pcDNAamp vector for in vitro translation and the pSRα and pcDNA3.1his vectors for expression in mammalian cells per the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Wild type HoxA10 was also subcloned into the pM2 vector for expression in mammalian cells as a fusion protein with the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4, as previously described (13Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).HoxA10 5′ truncation mutant cDNAs were generated by PCR, using primers that incorporate the genuine HoxA10 Kozak consensus sequence and an ATG. Truncation mutants were generated that included HoxA10 amino acids (aa) 1–207, 207–393, 269–393, 289–393, 314–393, 269–297, 207–275, 207–297, 269–314, 207–249, 207–233, 224–249, 250–275, and 297–314. These mutant cDNA sequences were subcloned into pcDNAamp vector for in vitro translation, into pSRα for overexpression in mammalian cells, and into the pM2 vector for expression in mammalian cells as a fusion protein with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. Truncated cDNAs were sequenced to verify that no unintended mutations had been introduced.HoxA10 cDNAs with mutation of the Pbx1 interaction domain were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis by a previously described technique (13Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The wild type HoxA01 was mutated to change amino acid 312 from asparagine to alanine and amino acid 313 from tryptophan to threonine (N312A/W323T HoxA10). This mutant cDNA and the wild type cDNA were subcloned into a pGEX vector for expression in E. coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. The Pbx-binding mutant HoxA10 was also subcloned into the pSRα vector for overexpression in mammalian cells, into the pM2 vector for expression in mammalian cells as a fusion protein with the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain, and into pcDNAamp for in vitro translation. The mutant cDNA was completely sequenced to assure that no unintended mutations had been introduced.Oligonucleotides—Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Core Facility of the University of Alabama, Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center or the Core Facility of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center at Northwestern University. Oligonucleotides were as follows: derived consensus sequence for Pbx/HoxA10 binding (dsA10), 5′-tgcgatgatttatgaccgc-3′; the similar sequence from the CYBB promoter (–94 to –134 bp) (dscybbA10) (21Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 5′-ttcagttgaccaatgattattagccaattttctgataaaa-3′. In these oligonucleotides, the HoxA10 core is in boldface type, the Pbx core is in italic type, and ccaat boxes are underlined.Myeloid Cell Line Culture—The human myelomonocytic cell line U937 (22Larrick J.W. Anderson S.J. Koren H.S. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 6-14PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Andrew Kraft. Cells were maintained and differentiated as described (5Clavo K.R. Sykes D.B. Pasillas M.

U937 cells were treated with 200 units/ml human recombinant IFNγ for 24 or 48 h, as indicated (Roche Applied Science).Northern Blots—Total cellular RNA was extracted from U937 cells, treated under various conditions, by the “single step” method, as previously described (27Eklund E.A. Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 15: 2418-2430Google Scholar). RNA was separated on denaturing formaldehyde gels and transferred to nylon membranes, according to standard techniques. Probes were generated by the random primer method, using cDNA sequences from genes of interest as a template. Message abundance from blots from three independent experiments was quantitated using the UN-SCAN-IT software.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Nuclear extract proteins were prepared by the method of Dignam (23Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 11: 1475-1479Crossref Scopus (9143) Google Scholar) with protease inhibitors (as described) (24Kautz B. Kakar R. David E. Eklund E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37868-37878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide probes were prepared, and EMSA and antibody supershift assays were performed, as described (13Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Antiserum to HoxA10 (not cross-reactive with other Hox proteins) was obtained from Covance Research Products (Richmond, CA) and from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to HDAC1, HDAC2, and the GAL4 DNA-binding domain were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. An antibody to Pbx1 that does not react with other Pbx proteins was also obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.In Vitro Translated Proteins—In vitro transcribed HoxA10 and N312A/W313T HoxA10 mRNA were generated from linearized template DNA, using the Riboprobe System, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). In vitro translated proteins were generated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Control (unprogrammed) lysates were generated in similar reactions in the absence of input RNA.In vitro translated proteins and nuclear proteins were tyrosine-dephosphorylated with Yop protein-tyrosine phosphatase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Proteins (either 10 μl of in vitro translated protein or 2 μg of nuclear proteins) were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in a 20-μl reaction volume with 50 units of Yop and 1× reaction buffer, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Control proteins were incubated similarly in 1× reaction buffer without Yop.EMSA with the in vitro translated proteins was performed as described (13Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The amount of mutant and wild type HoxA10 proteins in DNA-binding reactions was equalized by SDS-PAGE of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins.Transfection and Reporter Gene Assays—Cells were transfected by electroporation as described (13Eklund E.A.

U937 cells (32 × 106 cells/sample) were transfected with 70 μg of p-TATACAT or p-cybbTATACAT; 30 μg of pSRα, HoxA10/pSRα, N312A/W313T HoxA10/pSRα, 207–393 aa HoxA10/pSRα, 269–393 aa HoxA10/pSRα, or 314–393 aa HoxA10/pSRα; and 15 μg of p-CMVβ-gal (to normalize for transfection efficiency). Transfectants were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, followed by 24 h with or without trichostatin A (TSA) (500 or 1000 ng/ml). Preparation of cell extracts, β-galactosidase, and chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) assays were performed as described (25Seed B. Sheen J.-Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 26Sambrook H. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

The amount of GAL4 fusion protein expression vector used in these experiments was determined in preliminary studies in which the various HoxA10 expression plasmids were titrated to determine, for each construct, the amount of plasmid for maximal repression activity (10, 30, 60, and 120 μg). For all constructs, maximal repression activity was obtained with 60 μg of expression vector, consistent with our previous investigations with this assay (13Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitation was performed with 300 μg of nuclear proteins, extracted from U937 cells. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with HoxA10 antiserum (Covance Research Products) or control rabbit preimmune serum (11Pinsonneault J. Florence B. Vaessin J. McGinnis W. EMBO J. 1997; 8: 2032-2042Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Proteins were immunoprecipitated for 4 h at 4 °C, with 2 μl of HoxA10 antiserum or 2 μl of control rabbit preimmune serum, followed with a 1-h incubation with 30 μl of 50% staphylococcus protein A-Sepharose bead slurry, as described (13Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, eluted in SDS sample buffer, and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the blots were sequentially probed with anti-HoxA10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Pbx1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-HDAC2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoreactive proteins were detected by chemiluminescence, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences).In other experiments, lysate proteins (1.5 mg) from U937 transfectants with HoxA10/GAL4 or various truncation mutants of HoxA10/GAL4, vector control, or sham-transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-GAL4 DNA-binding domain antibody (rabbit polyclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or irrelevant control antibody (rabbit anti-mouse IgG from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), as described above. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blots, sequentially probed with antibodies to GAL4 DNA-binding domain (mouse monoclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or HDAC2, as described above.Histone Deacetylase Assays—Histone deacetylase assays were performed using the HDAC kit from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Substrates for the assays were U937 nuclear proteins (50 μg), isolated after TSA treatment (as described in the experimental design). In other assays, HDAC2 or HDAC1 was immunoprecipitated from U937 nuclear proteins (300 μg) under various TSA treatment conditions and assayed as above.GST Fusion Protein “Pull-down” Assays—JM109 Escherichia coli transformed with HoxA10 and various truncation mutants in the pGEX vector were grown to log phase, supplemented to 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with shaking. The cells were harvested and resuspended in HN buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P40, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm NaF) and sonicated on ice (13Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Debris was removed by centrifugation, and the lysate was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) and washed extensively with HN buffer. The beads were preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 5 μl of control rabbit reticulocyte lysate and then for 1 h with 20 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated protein and washed extensively in HN buffer. Proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated on 15% SDS-PAGE, and an autoradiograph was performed.RESULTSHoxA10 and Pbx1a Recruit HDAC2-negative Cis Elements in Genuine Target Genes—In these studies, we hypothesize that the DNA-bound HoxA10-Pbx1a complex recruits transcriptional co-repressor proteins to target genes in undifferentiated myeloid cells. Since Pbx1a can interact directly with transcriptional co-repressors (10Asahara H. Dutta S. Kao H.-Y. Evans R.M. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8219-8225Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), we also hypothesized that endogenous repression activity would be Pbx1a-dependent. To pursue this hypothesis, we further investigated the protein complex interacting with the negative CYBB cis elements. We performed EMSA, using the proximal CYBB repressor element as a labeled DNA probe and nuclear proteins from undifferentiated U937 cells (Fig. 1A). Previously, we demonstrated that antibodies to either HoxA10 or Pbx1a disrupt the low mobility complex that interacts with this probe (13Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the ability of antibodies to transcriptional co-repressors to disrupt or supershift this DNA-protein complex. We found that an antibody to HDAC2 specifically disrupts this complex, although antibodies to histone deacetylase 1 and preimmune serum have no effect.To reconfirm this interaction, we performed immunoprecipitation of HoxA10 from U937 nuclear proteins under nondenaturing conditions. We found that both Pbx1a and HDAC2 co-immunoprecipitate with HoxA10 from U937 nuclear proteins (Fig. 1B). No co-immunoprecipitation of HDAC1 was demonstrated (not shown). Together, these results provided initial confirmation of our hypothesis that the HoxA10-Pbx1a complex recruits histone deacetylase activity to myeloid gene promoters. However, interaction of HDAC2 with Pbx1a has not been described. Therefore, we further pursued our hypothesis by investigating the impact of histone deacetylase activity on CYBB and NCF2 transcription.Inhibition of Histone Deacetylase Activity Abrogates HoxA10 Transcriptional Repression Activity—Histone deacetylase inhibitors, such as TSA, induce some differentiation in myeloid leukemia cell lines and normal myeloid progenitors (28Ferrara F.F. Bianchini A. Padula F. Gelmetti V. Minucci S. Mancini M. Pelicci P.G. LoCoco F. Nervi C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2-7PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it would be reasonable to expect that histone deacetylase inhibition might increase transcription of genes characteristic of mature myeloid cells. We treated U937 cells with TSA, at various doses, and investigated the effect of histone deacetylase inhibition on myeloid-specific gene expression.In initial investigations, we determined the dose of TSA required for histone deacetylase inhibition in U937 cells. Consistent with the reports of other investigators (29Amann J.M. Nip J. Strom D.K. Lutterbach B. Harada H. Lenny N. Downing J.R. Meyers S. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6470-6483Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), we found greater than 80% of total histone deacetylase activity was inhibited by 24 h of treatment with 200 ng/ml TSA (84 ± 6%, n = 4). However, HDAC2 is relative refractory to most histone deacetylase inhibitors (29Amann J.M. Nip J. Strom D.K. Lutterbach B. Harada H. Lenny N. Downing J.R. Meyers S. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6470-6483Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined the dose of TSA required for specific HDAC2 inhibition. U937 cells were treated for 24 h with various amounts of TSA, HDAC2 was immunoprecipitated from U937 cell lysates, and HDAC activity of HDAC2 (or sham immunoprecipitated proteins) was determined. We found that 200 ng/ml TSA had no effect on HDAC2 activity, 500 ng/ml inhibited HDAC2 activity minimally (23 ± 5%, n = 2), and that HDAC2-specific inhibition required 1000 ng/ml of TSA (74 ± 9%, n = 2). Therefore, we used this higher dose to treat U937 cells, for analysis of gene expression. In control experiments, 200 ng/ml TSA inhibited HDAC1, immunoprecipitated from U937 cells.Total RNA from control and TSA-treated U937 cells was analyzed by Northern blot (Fig. 2A). The experiment was repeated three times, and mRNA abundance was quantitated by densitometry. For each message, mRNA abundance was normalized to the sample without TSA (Fig. 2A is a representative blot). We found TSA treatment significantly increases mRNA abundance of gp91PHOX and p67PHOX (-fold increase of 2.44 ± 0.23, p = 0.026, n = 3, and 2.62 ± 0.11, p = 0.004, n = 3, respectively). In contrast, TSA treatment did not significantly increase CD18 mRNA abundance (-fold increase of 1.26 ± 0.10, p = 0.133, n = 3), although this gene is also expressed in late myeloid differentiation. This result suggests that TSA treatment induces a gene-specific effect. TSA treatment had no significant effect on abundance of mRNA for the AML1 transcription factor (expressed early in myeloid differentiation) or for γ-actin (used as a loading control in these experiments).Fig. 2Histone deacetylase inhibition increases CYBB and NCF2 transcription in U937 cells.A, trichostatin A treatment increases the abundance of gp91PHOX and p67PHOX mRNA in undifferentiated U937 cells. Total RNA was isolated from U937 cells with and without 24 h with TSA, as described. Each experiment was repeated three times, and a representative blot is shown. Northern blots were probed with labeled cDNAs, as indicated. TSA treatment significantly increases the abundance of g"

We demonstrate using both genetic and biochemical approaches that the observed structural conservation between Saccharomyces cerevisiae frequenin (Frq1) and human NCS-1 is also reflected at the functional level. In yeast, the sole essential target of Frq1 is the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase isoform, Pik1; both FRQ1 and PIK1 are indispensable for cell viability. Expression of human NCS-1 in yeast, but not a close relative (human KChIP2), rescues the inviability of frq1 cells. Furthermore, in vitro, Frq1 and NCS-1 (either N-myristoylated or unmyristoylated) compete for binding to a small 28-residue motif near the N terminus of Pik1. Site-directed mutagenesis indicates that the binding determinant in Pik1 is a hydrophobic α-helix and that frequenins bind to one side of this α-helix. We propose, therefore, that the function of NCS-1 in mammals may closely resemble that of Frq1 in S. cerevisiae and, hence, that frequenins in general may serve as regulators of certain isoforms of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase.

Frequenins are a distinct subgroup in a larger class of related N-myristoylated proteins within the superfamily of small EF-hand-containing calcium-binding regulatory proteins, whose prototype is calmodulin (for a recent review, see Ref. 12.Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Other subgroups within this class are recoverins, visinins, neurocalcins, hippocalcins, guanylyl cyclase-activating proteins (GCAPs), 1The abbreviations used are: GCAPguanylyl cyclase-activating proteinKChIPpotassium channel-interacting proteinDTTdithiothreitolNTAnitrilotriacetic acidNCS-1neuronal calcium sensor-1PtdInsphosphatidylinositolPtdIns4Kβphosphatidylinositol 4-kinase βADactivation domainBDDNA-binding domainHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherence.1The abbreviations used are: GCAPguanylyl cyclase-activating proteinKChIPpotassium channel-interacting proteinDTTdithiothreitolNTAnitrilotriacetic acidNCS-1neuronal calcium sensor-1PtdInsphosphatidylinositolPtdIns4Kβphosphatidylinositol 4-kinase βADactivation domainBDDNA-binding domainHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherence. and potassium channel-interacting proteins (KChIPs). A distinguishing characteristic of these proteins, aside from modification by N-terminal myristoylation, is that all possess four recognizable EF-hand motifs, yet the first (and, sometimes, the fourth) is degenerate and unable to bind Ca2+. Frequenin has been highly conserved throughout evolution. There is 100% sequence identity among vertebrate frequenins, close to 75% identity between vertebrate and either of two invertebrate frequenins (Caenorhabditis elegans or Drosophila melanogaster), and nearly 60% identity between any of these frequenins and their ortholog (Frq1) in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (1.Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). A crystal structure of the unmyristoylated Ca2+-bound form of a mammalian (human) frequenin, which is also termed neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1), has been solved to 1.9-å resolution (2.Bourne Y. Dannenberg J. Pollmann V. Marchot P. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11949-11955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). A model for the three-dimensional structure of N-myristoylated Ca2+-bound yeast Frq1, based on analysis by NMR, is nearly superimposable (3.Ames J.B. Hendricks K.B. Strahl T. Huttner I.G. Hamasaki N. Thorner J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12149-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Three calcium ions are found bound to EF2, EF3, and EF4 in the structures of both yeast Frq1 (3.Ames J.B. Hendricks K.B. Strahl T. Huttner I.G. Hamasaki N. Thorner J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12149-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and human NCS-1 (2.Bourne Y. Dannenberg J. Pollmann V. Marchot P. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11949-11955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This stoichiometry is consistent with titration experiments in which calcium binding to both mammalian NCS-1 (4.Cox J.A. Durussel I. Comte M. Nef S. Nef P. Lenz S.E. Gundelfinger E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32807-32813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and S. cerevisiae Frq1 (3.Ames J.B. Hendricks K.B. Strahl T. Huttner I.G. Hamasaki N. Thorner J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12149-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) was shown to be high affinity, cooperative and saturated at three Ca2+ per molecule of protein.In the structures of both human NCS-1 and yeast Frq1, the four EF-hands come in two pairs positioned in a tandem linear array on one side of the molecule. This arrangement is quite different from that found in calmodulin and troponin C, where each pair of EF-hands is situated at either end of a dumbbell-shaped molecule (5.Yap K.L. Ames J.B. Swindells M.B. Ikura M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1999; 37: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The overall topology of two pairs of EF-hands in a tandem linear array is also observed in the structures of other members of the N-myristoylated, small Ca2+-binding proteins, namely neurocalcin (6.Vijay-Kumar S. Kumar V.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), recoverin (7.Tanaka T. Ames J.B. Harvey T.S. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1995; 376: 444-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 8.Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), and GCAP (9.Ames J.B. Dizhoor A.M. Ikura M. Palczewski K. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19329-19337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Despite this superficial similarity, both yeast Frq1 (3.Ames J.B. Hendricks K.B. Strahl T. Huttner I.G. Hamasaki N. Thorner J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12149-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and human NCS-1 (2.Bourne Y. Dannenberg J. Pollmann V. Marchot P. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11949-11955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) possess a wide hydrophobic crevice at their surface situated between the two EF-hand-containing lobes, as well as solvent-exposed N and C termini. These latter features are lacking in recoverin, neurocalcin, and GCAP.The function of frequenin has attracted much attention ever since it was implicated in neurotransmitter release at neuromuscular junctions. In fact, the name of the molecule derives from the fact that mutants of D. melanogaster that overexpress this protein display a marked facilitation of neurotransmitter release in third instar larvae, which depends dramatically on the frequency of stimulation (10.Pongs O. Lindemeier J. Zhu X.R. Theil T. Engelkamp D. Krah-Jentgens I. Lambrecht H.-G. Koch K.W. Schwemer J. Rivosecchi R. Mallart A. Galceran J. Canal I. Barbas J.A. Ferrús A. Neuron. 1993; 11: 15-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). On this basis, it was suggested that frequenin might serve as a calcium sensor to modulate synaptic activity and secretion. Likewise, in a tissue culture cell model of synaptic transmission, overexpression of rat NCS-1 in live PC12 cells potentiated release of growth hormone-containing secretory vesicles in response to agonists such as ATP (11.McFerran B.W. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22768-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 12.Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescence indicates that NCS-1 is localized at the trans-Golgi network of animal cells, consistent with a role for frequenin in vesicle trafficking and exocytosis (2.Bourne Y. Dannenberg J. Pollmann V. Marchot P. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11949-11955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest, however, that frequenin-mediated modulation of exocytosis may be exerted at the level of signal transduction, rather than through direct effects on the machinery for exocytosis. For instance, Ca2+-induced exocytosis in permeabilized PC12 cells is not potentiated by overexpression of NCS-1 (13.Koizumi S. Rosa P. Willars G.B. Challiss R.A.J. Taverna E. Francolini M. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Inoue K. Roder J. Jeromin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30315-30324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Similarly, NCS-1 is apparently not involved in modulation of depolarization-evoked exocytosis in PC12 cells (13.Koizumi S. Rosa P. Willars G.B. Challiss R.A.J. Taverna E. Francolini M. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Inoue K. Roder J. Jeromin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30315-30324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). By contrast, like the enhancement of agonist-evoked exocytosis in PC12 cells by NCS-1 overexpression, agonist-induced phosphoinositide turnover is also potentiated when NCS-1 is overexpressed (13.Koizumi S. Rosa P. Willars G.B. Challiss R.A.J. Taverna E. Francolini M. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Inoue K. Roder J. Jeromin A. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40183-40189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These data suggest that NCS-1 might modulate some aspect of phosphoinositide metabolism in animal cells, thereby promoting, for example, agonist-activated phospholipase C-dependent signaling. In agreement with this hypothesis is the observation that NCS-1 and phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 4-kinase-β co-localize in animal cells, as judged by immunocytochemical approaches (2.Bourne Y. Dannenberg J. Pollmann V. Marchot P. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11949-11955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 14.Zhao X.H. Varnai P. Tuymetova G. Balla A.

Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). It was shown that the yeast ortholog of frequenin, Frq1, functions as a Ca2+-sensing subunit of the yeast PtdIns 4-kinase β isoform, Pik1. Pik1 is a key enzyme in the control of vesicular trafficking in the late secretory pathway (15.Hama H. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Takemoto J.Y. DeWald D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34294-34300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 16.Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. Nat.

Absence of Pik1 in S. cerevisiae cells (a pik1Δ null mutation) is lethal (18.Flanagan C.A. Schnieders E.A. Emerick A.W. Kunisawa R. Admon A. Thorner J. Science. 1993; 262: 1444-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and pik1-ts mutants exhibit severe protein trafficking defects and accumulate morphologically aberrant Golgi membranes at the restrictive temperature (15.Hama H.

Likewise, frq1 mutants are inviable, but overexpression of PIK1 suppresses the lethality of frq1 cells, indicating that Pik1 is the sole essential target for Frq1 in yeast cells (1.Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Yeast Frq1 co-purifies stoichiometrically with Pik1 and is required for optimal activity of the enzyme and may also assist in membrane recruitment of Pik1 (1.Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 3.Ames J.B. Hendricks K.B. Strahl T. Huttner I.G. Hamasaki N. Thorner J.

University of California, Berkeley1999Google Scholar). Frq1 and Pik1 form a 1:1 complex, and the binding site for Frq1 has been mapped to residues 125–169 within the N terminus of Pik1 (20.Huttner I.G. Strahl T. Osawa M. King D.S. Ames J.B. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4862-4874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The binding of Frq1 to Pik1 appears to be mediated primarily by hydrophobic interactions in a Ca2+-independent manner, as judged by a variety of different biochemical studies (1.Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 20.Huttner I.G. Strahl T. Osawa M. King D.S. Ames J.B. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4862-4874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Given that the primary and tertiary structures of frequenins have been highly conserved from yeast to man, we sought to investigate in this study how closely the function of human NCS-1 resembles that of yeast Frq1. In a first approach, we examined whether human NCS-1 is able to functionally substitute for the absence of Frq1 in yeast and, if so, whether Ca2+ binding is required for the ability of human NCS-1 to rescue the inviability of Frq1-deficient yeast cells. Second, we used biochemical approaches, including the two-hybrid method in vivo and pull-down assays and monitoring of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in vitro, to assess whether human NCS-1 can interact with yeast Pik1. If so, we sought to determine whether NCS-1 associates at the same site on Pik1 as Frq1, then to delineate the sequence determinants responsible for this binding using alanine- and lysine-scanning mutagenesis, and finally to measure the strength and stoichiometry of this binding.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—Plasmids were constructed using standard methods for the manipulation of recombinant DNA (21.Chong L. Science. 2001; 292: 446Crossref Google Scholar, 22.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene) was used for routine manipulation and propagation of plasmids. All PCR reactions were performed using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene), and recombinant sequences were routinely verified by dideoxy chain termination sequencing (23.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52360) Google Scholar). pET22b-PIK1(10–192) was constructed by inserting an NdeI-SacI PCR fragment of PIK1 into pET22b (Novagen). pET22b-PIK1(10–107), pET22b-PIK1(53–144), pET22b-PIK1(65–172), pET22b-PIK1(100–192), pET22b-PIK1(120–192), and pET22b-PIK1(145–192) were constructed similarly, using appropriate synthetic oligonucleotide primers to generate the corresponding NdeI-SacI PCR fragments. Alanine and lysine scanning mutagenesis were carried out in vitro using pET22b-PIK1(10–192) as the template with forward and reverse primers designed to introduce mutations by overlap extension in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (24.Ling M.M. Robinson B.H. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 254: 157-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Otherwise, standard procedures for site-directed mutagenesis were used (25.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). The bacterial expression plasmid pET16b-NCS-1 has been described previously (2.Bourne Y. Dannenberg J. Pollmann V. Marchot P. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11949-11955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To generate pAS2–1-PIK1 and pGAD424-PIK1, the coding region of PIK1 was inserted as a BamHI-PstI PCR fragment into vectors pAS2–1 and pGAD424 (Clontech), respectively, that had also been cleaved with BamHI and PstI. NCS-1 was cloned into pAS2–1 and pGAD424 that had been linearized with NdeI and PstI. The coding sequences for calmodulin and KChIP2 were inserted as NdeI-BamHI fragments into pAS2–1. Multicopy (2-μm DNA-based) LEU2-marked plasmids YEp351GAL-NCS-1, YEp351GAL-NCS-1(G2A), YEp351GAL-NCS-1(E81V T117A T165A), and YEp351GAL-NCS-1(G2A E81V T117A T165A), were generated by insertion of the corresponding BamHI-SphI fragments, excised from pET16b-NCS-1, pET16b-NCS-1(G2A), pET16b-NCS-1(E81V T117A T165A), and pET16b-NCS-1(G2A E81V T117A T165A) into YEp351GAL (26.Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar), respectively. Construction of pET16b-NCS-1(E81V T117A T165A) is described elsewhere (2.Bourne Y. Dannenberg J. Pollmann V. Marchot P. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11949-11955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). pET16b-NCS-1(G2A) and pET16b-NCS-1(G2A E81V T117A T165A) were created by PCR-based in vitro overlap-extension mutagenesis (24.Ling M.M. Robinson B.H. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 254: 157-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) using pET16b-NCS-1 and pET16b-NCS-1(E81V T117A T165A) as templates. YEp351GAL-KChIP2 was generated by inserting an SphI-HindIII fragment encoding human KChIP2 (27.Bahring R. Dannenberg J. Peters H.C. Leicher T. Pongs O. Isbrandt D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23888-23894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) into YEp351-GAL that had been linearized with PaeI and HindIII.NCS-1 and PIK1 Cloning, Expression, and Purification—Expression and purification of NCS-1 have been described previously (2.Bourne Y. Dannenberg J. Pollmann V. Marchot P. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11949-11955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). DNA encoding PIK1 was amplified by PCR using yeast genomic DNA as the template with primer sequences, derived from the data base entry for PIK1 (GenBank™/EBI accession no. NC_001146), designed to permit subcloning into pET22b (Novagen) that was linearized with NdeI and SacI, generating the bacterial expression vector pET-PIK1. pET-PIK1 was introduced into E. coli strain BL21(DE3)RIL (Stratagene) by DNA-mediated transformation. The resulting cells were grown in Luria-Bertani medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C until the culture reached an A600 nm of 0.7. Next, Pik1-His6 expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Induced cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 300 mm NaCl) per 500 ml of bacterial culture and subsequently treated with lysozyme (final concentration 100 μg/ml) for 10 min on ice. Dithiothreitol (DTT) and N-laurylsarcosine were added to final concentrations of 5 mm and 1.5% (v/v), respectively. After sonication (1 min, level 4, 50% duty cycle), the lysate was cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The resulting supernatant solution was adjusted to a final concentration of 3% Triton X-100, filtered (0.45-μm pore size) and loaded onto a 1-ml Ni2+-saturated nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-agarose column (Qiagen). After washing with buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole), bound protein was eluted with buffer B (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole). Pik1-His6-containing fractions were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9 and concentrated with the help of centrifugal filter devices (Millipore) until a final concentration of ∼5 mg/ml had been reached.In Vitro Pull-down Assays—NCS-1 (0.7 μg), expressed in and purified from bacteria (2.Bourne Y. Dannenberg J. Pollmann V. Marchot P. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11949-11955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), was incubated at 4 °C either alone or with 7 μg of the different Pik1-His6 derivatives in a final volume of 0.5 ml of YLB (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 μm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT) on a roller drum for 1 h, and then 20 μl of a 50% slurry of Ni2+-saturated NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) that had been preblocked in YLB containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin were added. After an additional 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed three times (1 ml each) in wash buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μm CaCl2, 50 mm imidazole). Subsequently, bound proteins were eluted from the beads in 30 μl of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer (28.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar), resolved by electrophoresis in 15% SDS-PAGE gels, and analyzed by immunoblotting using appropriate antisera or staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.Yeast Strains, Growth Conditions, and Media—Routine growth and manipulation of S. cerevisiae strains were performed as described previously (29.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.A. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Conventional methods for DNA-mediated transformation of yeast cells were used (30Guthrie, C., and Fink, G. R. (eds) (1991) Methods Enzymol., 194Google Scholar).

Transformants were subjected to conditions appropriate to induce sporulation (1% potassium acetate, 0.022% (w/v) raffinose) and incubated for 72 h at 26 °C. Subsequently, ascospores were dissected with the help of a micromanipulator on YPGal plates and grown at 26 °C for 96 h.Preparation of Yeast Cell Extracts and Immunoblot Analysis—Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in standard rich (YP) medium, containing 2% galactose as carbon source (29.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.A. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Preparation and preclearing of cellular lysates were carried out essentially as described (20.Huttner I.G. Strahl T. Osawa M. King D.S. Ames J.B. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4862-4874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Protein concentration in each clarified extract was determined using a commercial kit (Bio-Rad) based on the dye-binding method of Bradford (31.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein were resolved in 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and wild-type and mutant versions of NCS-1 were detected by immunoblotting using affinity-purified polyclonal NCS-1 antiserum (dilution 1:500), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugate (Zymed) and a commercial chemiluminescence kit (Western Lightning, PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Two-hybrid experiments were performed using yeast strain CG-1945 (Clontech), harboring HIS3 and lacZ (β-galactosidase) reporter genes. pGAD424-based (Gal4 transcriptional-activation domain fusion vector, Clontech) derivatives of PIK1 and NCS-1, as well as pAS2–1 (Gal4 DNA binding domain fusion vector, Clontech) constructs of KChIP2, calmodulin, NCS-1, and PIK1 were used. Transformations and subsequent steps were performed according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Matchmaker two-hybrid system, Clontech).Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence—Fluorescence spectra were recorded at room temperature using a PerkinElmer 2550B spectrofluorimeter at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. Intrinsic fluorescence of NCS-1 (75 nm) was monitored over an emission wavelength range of 310 to 400 nm. Fluorometric titrations were done in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm DTT, using a 5 × 10-mm black cuvette. Fluorescence spectra were recorded before and after the addition of 2.5–40 μl of Pik1(120–192) (final concentration 20–640 nm). In parallel, tryptophan emission spectra of comparable fluorescence intensity were collected at 340–360 nm to correct for dilution and unspecific effects of Pik1(120–192) absorbance. The Pik1 peptide itself does not contain any tryptophan residues and, therefore, should not contribute any fluorescence to affect these measurements. Binding data were calculated from the observed changes in fluorescence intensity accompanying the addition of Pik1(120–192), using methods described previously (32.Pongs O. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 2316-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Data analysis and curve fitting were done with the help of KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software). For KD measurements, titrations were performed at protein concentrations below the KD value. Values were determined assuming that all proteins present were in their native and functional state and not corrected for the possible presence of inactive species.RESULTSInviability of S. cerevisiae frq1Δ Cells Is Rescued by Human NCS-1—Frequenins seem to be conserved at the level of both primary and tertiary structure from yeast to humans. Frq1, the apparent S. cerevisiae ortholog of NCS-1, binds to and is essential for the function of Pik1, a PtdIns 4-kinase, and this role is the only indispensable cellular function of Frq1 (1.Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Whether NCS-1 directly interacts with a PtdIns 4-kinase in vertebrate cells, and whether this association is physiologically relevant, has not been demonstrated unequivocally, although considerable circumstantial evidence has been obtained in support of this conclusion (14.Zhao X.H. Varnai P. Tuymetova G. Balla A. Toth Z.E. Oker-Blom C. Roder J. Jeromin A. Balla T. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2018164461,"Lys212 and Tyr140 are close to the enzyme-bound isocitrate in the recently determined crystal structure of porcine NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (Ceccarelli, C., Grodsky, N. B., Ariyaratne, N., Colman, R. F., and Bahnson, B. J. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 43454–43462). We have constructed mutant enzymes in which Lys212 is replaced by Gln, Tyr, and Arg, and Tyr140 is replaced by Phe, Thr, Glu, and Lys. Wild type and mutant enzymes were each expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. At pH 7.4, the specific activity is decreased in K212Q, K212Y, and K212R, respectively, to 0.01–9% of wild type. The most striking change is in the pH-Vmax curves. Wild type depends on the deprotonated form of a group of pKaes 5.7, whereas this pKaes is increased to 7.4 in neutral K212Q and to 8.3 in K212Y. In contrast, the positive K212R has a pKaes of 5.9. These results indicate that (by electrostatic repulsion) a positively charged residue at position 212 lowers the pK of the nearby ionizable group in the enzyme-substrate complex. Lys212 may also stabilize the carbanion formed initially on substrate decarboxylation. The Tyr140 mutants have specific activities at pH 7.4 that are reduced to 0.2–0.5% of those of wild type, whereas their Km values for isocitrate and NADP are not increased. Most notable are the altered pH-Vmax profiles. Vmax is constant from pH 5.3 to 8 for Y140F and Y140T and increases as pH is decreased for Y140E and Y140K. These results suggest that in wild type enzyme, Tyr140 is the general acid that protonates the substrate after decarboxylation and that the carboxyl and ammonium forms of Y140E and Y140K provide partial substitutes. Relative to wild type, the Y140T enzyme is specifically activated 106-fold by exogenous addition of acetic acid and 88-fold by added phenol; and the K212Q enzyme is activated 4-fold by added ethylamine. These chemical rescue experiments support the conclusion that Tyr140 and Lys212 are required for the catalytic activity of porcine NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. Lys212 and Tyr140 are close to the enzyme-bound isocitrate in the recently determined crystal structure of porcine NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (Ceccarelli, C., Grodsky, N.

These chemical rescue experiments support the conclusion that Tyr140 and Lys212 are required for the catalytic activity of porcine NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. Porcine heart mitochondrial NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.42), a citric acid cycle enzyme, catalyzes first the oxidation of isocitrate to form enzyme-bound oxalosuccinate, followed by the decarboxylation of the β-keto acid to yield α-ketoglutarate, NADPH, and carbon dioxide. It has been postulated that the reaction is initiated by the deprotonation of the hydroxyl group of isocitrate; the hydrogen of the resultant alkoxide ion would then be easily removed as hydride and transferred to NADP (1.Colman R.F. Pept. Protein Rev. 1983; 1: 41-69Google Scholar). An enzymic general base was proposed as participating in the removal of the proton from the hydroxyl group. Since the pH dependence of Vmax reveals the requirement for the basic form of a group of pKaes 5.7, the general base was initially thought to be a carboxylate side chain of the enzyme (2.Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 8137-8143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Grodsky N.B. Soundar S. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2193-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, isocitrate dehydrogenase requires a divalent metal cation for catalysis, and more recently, it has been suggested that the pKaes of about 5.7 might represent the ionization of the Mn2+-coordinated hydroxyl of isocitrate (4.Ceccarelli C. Grodsky N.B. Ariyaratne N. Colman R.F. Bahnson B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43454-43462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The subsequent decarboxylation of oxalosuccinate leads to the enolate form of the product, and an enzymic general acid was proposed to facilitate protonation of the enolate at the same carbon from which the CO2 was lost, thereby generating the product α-ketoglutarate. The general acid of the enzyme has not been identified. Porcine NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase is a dimer of identical subunits, each of which has a molecular mass of 46,600 Da and 413 amino acids (5.Bailey J.M. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5367-5377Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 6.Haselbeck R.J. Colman R.F. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6219-6223Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the Mn2+-isocitrate complex of this isocitrate dehydrogenase has recently been solved to a resolution of 1.85 Å (4.Ceccarelli C. Grodsky N.B. Ariyaratne N. Colman R.F. Bahnson B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43454-43462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Each of the two active sites, located predominantly within one subunit, includes amino acid side chains from the other subunit. Fig. 1 shows a view of Mn2+-isocitrate bound to the B subunit. The Mn2+ (green) is coordinated to an oxygen of the α-carboxylate and to the hydroxyl of isocitrate, to two water molecules, and to an oxygen of Asp275 of the B subunit, as well as to an oxygen of Asp252 of the A subunit (4.Ceccarelli C. Grodsky N.B. Ariyaratne N. Colman R.F. Bahnson B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43454-43462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Arg101, Arg110, and Arg133 (not shown) are close to the carboxyl groups of isocitrate (white); the importance of these residues has been demonstrated by mutagenesis (7.Soundar S. Danek B.L. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5606-5612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Tyr140 of the B subunit is very close to the β-carboxylate of isocitrate, and Lys212 of the A subunit is also located in the vicinity of isocitrate. The roles of this tyrosine and this lysine in the function of mammalian NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase have not been investigated previously, although sequence and structure-based alignments show that these residues are conserved in all known isocitrate dehydrogenases. We now evaluate the importance of Lys212 by mutating it to glutamine, tyrosine, and arginine and of Tyr140 by replacing it with phenylalanine, threonine, glutamate, and lysine. The results demonstrate that both Lys212 and Tyr140 are critical for catalysis by porcine NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. A preliminary version of this work has been presented (8.Kim T.-K.

Expression and Purification of Wild Type and Mutant Enzymes—The recombinant wild type and mutant enzymes expressed in E. coli as maltose-binding fusion protein were purified by chromatography on an amylose column as described previously (3.Grodsky N.B. Soundar S. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2193-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7.Soundar S. Danek B.L. Colman R.F. J. Biol.

Colman R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 401: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Isocitrate dehydrogenase was cleaved from the maltose-binding protein by incubating the fusion protein with human plasma thrombin, and the digest was applied to a DE52 column to separate isocitrate dehydrogenase from maltose-binding protein, as described previously (11.Lee P. Colman R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 401: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The purified, concentrated enzyme was dialyzed against 0.1 m triethanolamine chloride buffer, pH 7.7, containing 0.3 m Na2SO4 and 10% glycerol and stored at -80 °C. The protein concentration was determined from E280 nm1%= 10.8 (12.Johanson R.A. Colman R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 207: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The purity of the enzymes was determined by SDS-PAGE as described previously (7.Soundar S. Danek B.L. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5606-5612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 10.Huang Y.C. Colman R.F.

N-terminal amino acid sequencing was carried out on an Applied Biosystem Procise protein/peptide sequencer. Circular Dichroism of the Enzymes—CD spectra were measured using a Jasco model J-710 spectrophotometer as described for isocitrate dehydrogenase (3.Grodsky N.B. Soundar S. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2193-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The enzymes were diluted to 0.25 mg/ml in 25 mm triethanolamine chloride buffer, pH 7.7, containing 10% glycerol and 75 mm Na2SO4. The ellipticity was measured at room temperature, from 250 to 200 nm. The final concentration of the enzymes was measured by a Coomassie Blue dye-binding assay (14.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), using purified isocitrate dehydrogenase as the protein standard. Molecular Weight Determination of the Enzymes—The molecular weight of the enzymes was determined by native gel electrophoresis (11.Lee P. Colman R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 401: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 15.Hedrick J.L. Smith A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 126: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). All the enzymes and molecular weight markers (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 72 kDa; enolase, 84 kDa; phosphoglycerate mutase, 66 kDa) were diluted with 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 5.5, containing 10% glycerol, to give enzyme concentrations around 0.4 mg/ml and were dialyzed against the same buffer before use. The other molecular mass markers (lysozyme, 14.3 kDa; α-chymotrypsinogen A, 25.7 kDa; cytochrome c, 12 kDa) and methyl green were dissolved directly in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 5.5, containing 10% glycerol at a concentration of 2 mg/ml. 0.2 m potassium phosphate, pH 5.0 (10× buffer), was used to prepare 5–10% native polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresis running buffer (1× buffer) in order to obtain final pH 5.5 in the gels and running buffer. The relative mobility (Rf) of each protein was calculated by dividing its migration distance (from the top of the gel to the center of the protein band) by the migration distance of the methyl green. A plot of 100 log (100 × Rf) versus the gel concentration was used to generate the negative slopes for the protein standards. The slopes of these lines were then plotted against the known molecular masses on log-log paper. The molecular masses of wild type and each mutant enzyme were determined from the latter graph (11.Lee P. Colman R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 401: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 15.Hedrick J.L. Smith A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 126: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays and Kinetic Parameter Determinations—The enzyme assay was performed spectrophotometrically by measuring the reduction of NADP to NADPH at 340 nm. The standard assay solution was 30 mm triethanolamine chloride buffer, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm NADP, 4 mmdl-isocitrate, and 2 mm MnSO4 in a total volume of 1 ml. The specific activity was calculated as the μmol of NADPH produced min-1 mg-1 protein under the standard assay condition. For the Km measurements, the concentration of either isocitrate, NADP, or Mn2+ was varied, and the other substrates were maintained at the standard assay conditions. The Km and Vmax values were calculated from direct plots of velocity versus substrate concentration, using SigmaPlot software. pH Dependence of Vmax—The pH dependence of Vmax for each of the enzymes was measured using the following buffers: pH 5.0–6.2, sodium acetate and sodium MES; pH 5.8–7.4, imidazole chloride; pH 6.8–8.0, triethanolamine chloride; pH 7.8–8.8, sodium TAPS. All of the buffers were 30 mm in anion concentration. The reaction rate was measured using 0.1 mm NADP, 4 mm dl-isocitrate, and 2 mm MnSO4, unless indicated otherwise. Chemical Rescue—Chemical rescue was measured by adding varying concentrations of acetic acid/acetate, phenol, methylammonium chloride, ethylammonium chloride, or propylammonium chloride to the reaction mixture. For Lys212 mutant enzymes, the reaction mixture was generally the same as standard assay solution at pH 7.4. In specified cases, 30 mm imidazole chloride buffer, pH 6.7, or 30 mm sodium TAPS buffer, pH 8.4, was used. For Tyr140 mutant enzymes, the reaction mixture usually contained imidazole chloride buffer, pH 6.4 (anion concentration was 30 mm), 0.1 mm NADP, 4 mm dl-isocitrate, and 2 mm MnSO4. In some cases, as indicated, the buffer used was 30 mm sodium MES, pH 5.4, or 30 mm triethanolamine chloride, pH 7.4. The rates were measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. Synthesis of [3H]α-Ketoglutarate—[3H]α-Ketoglutarate was synthesized by a method modified from that described by Rose (16.Rose Z.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 928-933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α-Ketoglutarate, sodium salt (0.186 mg, 1 mmol), was dissolved in 0.6 ml of water; the pH of the solution was adjusted to around 8.0, and the volume of the solution was brought up to 1.0 ml with distilled water to yield a 1 m solution. An aliquot (100 μl) of the 1 m α-ketoglutarate solution was added to 1.0 ml of [3H]H2O (1 mCi/ml) (Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA) in a glass vial with a Teflon screw cap. The mixture was heated in a 95 °C sand bath overnight. The mixture was then applied to a 1.5 × 20-cm column of AG 1-X8 (chloride form, 20–50 mesh) (Bio-Rad), equilibrated with distilled water. The unincorporated [3H]H2O was separated from [3H]α-ketoglutarate by first eluting the AG 1-X8 column with distilled water; the [3H]α-ketoglutarate was then eluted from the column with 0.1 n HCl. Fractions with high radioactivity, as measured using a Packard Tri-Carb model 1500 liquid scintillation counter, were pooled and lyophilized. The dried [3H]α-ketoglutarate was dissolved in about 0.6 ml of distilled water, and the pH of the solution was carefully adjusted to around 4.5. The [3H]α-ketoglutarate was aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. The concentration of [3H]α-ketoglutarate was determined by using the compound as a substrate for glutamate dehydrogenase, as described previously (17.Madhusoodan K.S. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1577-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase was diluted with 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.1. Various concentrations of α-ketoglutarate (from 10 μm to 3 mm) were added to an assay solution that contained 10 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8, with 10 μm EDTA, 100 μm NADH, and 50 mm ammonium chloride (17.Madhusoodan K.S. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1577-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The glutamate dehydrogenase activity was measured by the rate of oxidation of NADH to NAD at 340 nm and 25 °C. A Michaelis-Menten plot of velocity versus α-ketoglutarate concentration was generated and used for determining the concentration of [3H]α-ketoglutarate, which is needed to calculate the specific radioactivity of the compound. Detritiation Assay—As modified from the description of Rose (16.Rose Z.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 928-933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the rate of release of tritium from [3H]α-ketoglutarate, catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase, was determined using a standard assay solution containing 30 mm triethanolamine chloride buffer, pH 7.4, 400 μm NADPH, 2 mm MnSO4, and 5 mm [3H]α-ketoglutarate (radiospecific activity around 5–8 × 109 cpm/mol α-ketoglutarate) in a total volume of 0.16 ml. Either wild type or mutant enzyme was added to the standard assay solution and incubated at 37 °C in a water bath for 2 h. At the end of this period, 0.34 ml of distilled water was added to the incubation mixture. The entire solution (0.5 ml total) was applied to a 1 × 3-cm column of AG 1-X8 (Cl- form) at room temperature. The incubation tube was rinsed once with water, and the wash was also applied to the AG 1-X8 column. The free [3H]H2O was completely eluted from the column with 30 ml of water (1.5 ml/fraction). An aliquot (0.5 ml) from each fraction was pipetted into 15 ml of Liquiscint (Fisher), and the radioactivity was measured using a Packard Tri-Carb model 1500 liquid scintillation counter. A correction was made for the release of [3H]H2O in the absence of isocitrate dehydrogenase. The net amount of enzyme-catalyzed [3H]H2O released was linearly dependent on the incubation time and on the amount of isocitrate dehydrogenase added. The rate of detritiation was calculated and expressed in μmol of tritium/min/mg of enzyme. Expression and Purification of the Enzymes—The wild type and mutant pig heart mitochondrial NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases were generated using the expression vector pMALcIDP1 and the QuikChange XL Site-directed Mutagenesis kit. To evaluate the importance of the positively charged Lys212 for enzyme function, lysine was replaced by the neutral glutamine and tyrosine and by the positively charged arginine. To assess the role of the phenolic Tyr140, tyrosine was replaced by the aromatic phenylalanine, by threonine (substituting an aliphatic hydroxyl for an aromatic hydroxyl), by glutamate (to evaluate the effect of a negative charge at position 140), and by the positively charged lysine. The recombinant porcine enzymes were expressed in E. coli and purified, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All the enzymes are expressed well and are homogeneous as viewed by PAGE in the presence of SDS. All exhibit the same apparent subunit molecular mass of ∼43,000 Da; this value is close to the actual subunit molecular mass of 46,600 Da calculated from the known amino acid sequence (6.Haselbeck R.J. Colman R.F. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6219-6223Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing of each enzyme confirmed the purity of the preparation and indicated that all of the isolated enzyme is porcine isocitrate dehydrogenase, which differs from the E. coli isocitrate dehydrogenase in 9 of the first 10 amino acids. Circular Dichroism Spectra of the Enzymes—In order to evaluate whether these enzymes have any changes in their secondary structures, CD spectra were measured. The mutant and wild type enzymes have CD spectra that are superimposable with minima occurring at about 208 and 221 nm (data not shown). This result suggests that these mutations do not cause any appreciable change in the secondary structure of these isocitrate dehydrogenases. Molecular Weight of the Enzymes—The molecular weights of the wild type and mutant enzymes were determined by native gel electrophoresis in phosphate buffer. All mutant enzymes exhibit molecular weights comparable with that of wild type (92,000), indicating that they exist as dimers, as is normally found under mild conditions. The Specific Activity and Kinetic Parameters of Lys212 Mutant Enzymes—The specific activity of wild type isocitrate dehydrogenase is 35 μmol min-1 mg-1, comparable with previous reports (4.Ceccarelli C. Grodsky N.B. Ariyaratne N. Colman R.F. Bahnson B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43454-43462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In contrast, the specific activities of all the Lys212 mutant enzymes are greatly decreased (to 0.01–9% of wild type), as shown in Table I. These results indicate that Lys212 has an important role in catalytic activity. The highest specific activity is exhibited by K212R, which retains the positive charge of the normal lysine.Table IKinetic parameters for wild type and Lys212 mutant NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenasesEnzymeSpecific activityaThe standard assay solution contained 4 mmdl-isocitrate, 100 μm NADP, and 2 mm MnSO4 in 30 mm triethanolamine chloride buffer, pH 7.4, in a total volume of 1 mlVmaxbVmax and Km values at pH 7.4 were determined by varying the substrate concentration and maintaining the other substrates at the standard assay conditionsKm-NADPbVmax and Km values at pH 7.4 were determined by varying the substrate concentration and maintaining the other substrates at the standard assay conditionsKm-isocitratebVmax and Km values at pH 7.4 were determined by varying the substrate concentration and maintaining the other substrates at the standard assay conditionsKm-Mn2+bVmax and Km values at pH 7.4 were determined by varying the substrate concentration and maintaining the other substrates at the standard assay conditionsμmol min—1 mg—1μmμmμmWild type35.1 ± 0.139.6 ± 1.29.85 ± 0.797.47 ± 0.970.11 ± 0.01K212Q0.065 ± 0.0290.073 ± 0.00313.7 ± 1.59.76 ± 1.110.91 ± 0.31K212Y0.003 ± 0.0010.003 ± 0.0017.29 ± 0.609.24 ± 0.821.05 ± 0.49K212R3.16 ± 0.483.34 ± 0.0918.2 ± 1.1116 ± 16252 ± 27.2a The standard assay solution contained 4 mmdl-isocitrate, 100 μm NADP, and 2 mm MnSO4 in 30 mm triethanolamine chloride buffer, pH 7.4, in a total volume of 1 mlb Vmax and Km values at pH 7.4 were determined by varying the substrate concentration and maintaining the other substrates at the standard assay conditions Open table in a new tab The Km values for coenzyme and substrate of wild type and Lys212 mutant enzymes are summarized in Table I. The Km values for NADP are not appreciably changed in these Lys212 mutant enzymes. Similarly the apparent Km values for isocitrate are not altered in the K212Q and K212Y mutants. It is only in the K212R mutant, in which one positively charged amino acid is replaced by another positively charged residue, that the Km for isocitrate is increased 15-fold compared with wild type. These results suggest that the larger size of arginine may interfere with the binding of isocitrate in the active site. In any case, it is clear that Lys212 does not contribute to the affinity of the enzyme for its negatively charged substrate, isocitrate. The apparent Km value for Mn2+ is increased a little in the K212Q and K212Y mutants but is elevated dramatically in the K212R mutant. (The actual substrate for this enzyme has been shown to be manganous-tribasic isocitrate (18.Colman R.F. Villafranca J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 209-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 215-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Ehrlich R.S. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4034-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); however, changes in the affinity for this substrate can be observed in the apparent Km value for either isocitrate or manganese.) The pH dependence of Vmax was determined for the wild type and mutant enzymes in order to evaluate the effect on the ionizable group caused by replacement of Lys212. The concentrations of substrate and coenzyme were high relative to the Km values to ensure the enzymes were saturated over the entire pH range. Thus, 2 mm Mn2+, 4 mm dl-isocitrate, and 0.1 mm NADP were used for wild type, K212Q, and K212Y, whereas 4 mm Mn2+, 8 mm dl-isocitrate, and 0.2 mm NADP were used for the K212R enzyme. The dependence of the measured Vmaxobs on pH was analyzed in accordance with Equation 1,Vmaxobs=Vmaxint1+(H+)Kaes(Eq. 1) where Vmaxobs is the maximum velocity at a given pH, Vmaxint is the intrinsic pH-independent maximum velocity, and Kaes is the dissociation constant for the ionizable group of th"
https://openalex.org/W2020805268,"Occludin is an essential membrane protein component of cellular tight junctions, participating in both cell-cell adhesion in the paracellular space and anchoring of the junctional complex to the cytoskeleton. The latter function is accomplished through binding of the C-terminal cytoplasmic region to scaffolding proteins that mediate binding to cytoskeletal actin. We isolated a structural domain from both the bacterial-expressed C-terminal cytoplasmic region of human occludin and native cellular occludin, extracted from epithelial (Madin-Darby canine kidney) or endothelial (human brain) cells, by limited proteolysis with trypsin. This human occludin domain contains the last 119 amino acids as identified by N-terminal sequencing and peptide mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Based on the sequence and secondary structure prediction, this domain contains 4 of 5 α-helices in the C-terminal region and is linked to the fourth membrane-spanning region by a loosely structured tethering polypeptide. Comparison of circular dichroism spectra of recombinant proteins corresponding to the entire C-terminal region versus only the binding domain region also supports the interpretation that the helical structural elements are concentrated in that domain. Co-immunoprecipitation of this domain with ZO-2 demonstrated preservation of the specificity of the scaffolding protein-binding function, and binding studies with immobilized ZO-2 suggest the presence of multiple ZO-2 binding sites in this domain.

These scaffolding proteins are members of the MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase containing) family of proteins, which contain variable numbers of PSD-95/discs-large/ZO-1 (PDZ) domains, a Src homology (SH3) domain, and a region homologous to guanylate kinase (GUK) in the same sequential order (16.Beatch M.

Occludin binds to the GUK domain of each of the ZO proteins, while the claudins bind to the first PDZ (PDZ-1) domain (12.Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol.

The identification of the GUK domains of these three proteins is based on the amino acid comparison with GUK-containing proteins from the international protein data base (13.Haskins J. Gu L.

The binding between occludin and the ZO proteins is determined by the structure of its C-terminal cytoplasmic region. It is highly likely that this binding occurs in a compactly folded domain within this region; however, previous studies have not elucidated the precise identity of such a domain or the manner of its linkage to the rest of the occludin molecule. It is also not determined whether the binding affinity of ZO-1 with occludin differs from ZO-2 or ZO-3. Furuse et al. (18.Furuse M. Itoh M. Hirase T. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) have shown that truncation of C-terminal segments of occludin weakens or eliminates the binding to ZO-1, while deletion of short segments near the N terminus of the C-terminal cytoplasmic region do not alter this binding function. Nusrat et al. (19.Nusrat A. Chen J.A. Foley C.S. Liang T.W. Tom J. Cromwell M. Quan C. Mrsny R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29816-29822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) studied a synthetic peptide, which they described as a “coiled-coil domain,” corresponding to amino acids 440-469 of the C-terminal region of human occludin. This peptide was shown to bind to native ZO-1 from T84 epithelial cells. While truncation studies can localize the functional elements with regard to the primary sequence, and binding studies using synthetic peptides can identify a specific region primarily responsible for recognition, neither provides complete information regarding the structural motif responsible for binding the GUK domain of the scaffolding proteins or the identity of potential regulatory elements within the binding domain of occludin. In order to investigate both binding and regulation, the full domain of occludin that interacts with the GUK domain needs to be identified and isolated. Limited proteolysis, on the other hand, allows intact compact structural domains to be separated from more loosely coiled regions of the protein sequence, largely preserving the natural domain structure (20.Ramzan M.A. Cookson E.J. Beynon R.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 296SCrossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 21.Belova G.I. Prasad R. Nazimov I.V. Wilson S.H. Slesarev A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4959-4965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the study described in this report, we used this method to isolate a structural domain from the region of occludin known to bind the ZO proteins, then tested this domain for retention of the binding function using co-immunoprecipitation and estimated the stoichiometry and dissociation constant using a binding technique. This method has the advantage of preserving the natural structure of occludin, either as expressed in bacteria or extracted from cells, and isolating the functional region to an intact domain of minimal size to facilitate further structural investigation. N-terminal sequencing and peptide mass fingerprinting (22.Scheler C. Lamer S. Pan Z. Li X.P. Salnikow J. Jungblut P. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 918-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) were employed to identify the precise sequence of the domain. Cell Culture—MDCK (ATCC, Manassas, VA) cells were cultured in medium containing MEM (minimum essential medium) supplemented with non-essential amino acids, 15 mm of HEPES and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cultures were maintained in a humidified CO2 incubator (5% CO2/95% air) at 37 °C. Expression Plasmid Construction—Methods followed the procedures of Sambrook et al. (23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Vol. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 21-84Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Two expression plasmids (for C-Occ and dN-Occ, defined below) were constructed by cloning the PCR-amplified occludin cDNA fragment into the expression vector pRSETA (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA). The template plasmid (pSK-hocc, a generous gift from Drs. C. M. Van Itallie and James M. Anderson) (24.Van Itallie C.M. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) contains the entire coding region for human occludin (GenBank™ accession number U53823). PCR was performed to generate cDNA for the entire C-terminal cytoplasmic region of occludin (C-Occ) using two primers, 5′-TGCTGGATCCACTCGAAGAAAGATG-3′ and 5′-CAACTTGGCATCAGAATTCTATG-3′, and to generate a 121 amino acid deletion in the C-Occ cDNA between the His tag and the last four predicted helices (resultant protein designated dN-Occ) using the upstream primer, 5′-CAAAGGGAGGATCCGGAAGG-3′ and the same downstream primer as for C-Occ. The amplification cycle was programmed to denature the template at 95 °C for 1 min, anneal the primer to the template at 45 °C for 1 min and synthesize the cDNA at 68 °C for 1 min for a total of 30 cycles. The PCR fragment and the cloning vector pRSETA were digested with restriction enzymes, BamHI and EcoRI, and then the digested fragments were separated from undigested fragments by electrophoresis. The digested fragments were purified by electroelution using dialysis tubing with 12-kDa molecular mass cutoff (Spectrum Medical Industries, Houston, TX). After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, these two purified fragments were ligated together at 16 °C overnight. After cloning the PCR fragment into pRSETA, the insert was sequenced from both directions to confirm its identity using T7 forward primer and pRSET reverse primer. His-tagged Protein Expression and Purification—Plasmid with cDNA insert was transformed into BL21 DE3 bacteria, and expression of the His-tagged proteins (C-Occ or dN-Occ) was stimulated by 0.1 mm of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Four hours after induction, bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 8630 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and then lysed in high salt sodium phosphate buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate and 500 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.4) containing 100 μg/ml of lysozyme and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Protease inhibitor mixture was added as 100 μl per ml of solution of 10× inhibitor mixture prepared according to manufacturer's directions in high salt sodium phosphate buffer. Total soluble proteins were collected after centrifugation at 31,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and then incubated with nickel-charged ProBond resin (Invitrogen) for 30 min. The protein was then eluted with increasing (150-400 mm) concentrations of imidazole from the ProBond column after washing with high salt sodium phosphate buffer containing 50-100 mm imidazole to remove other bacterial proteins nonspecifically bound to the nickel resin. The purified proteins were analyzed for purity using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with occludin antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc. South San Francisco, CA). Concentration of the resultant protein solution was ∼100 μg/ml. Full-length canine ZO-2 was expressed in Sf9 insect cells using the Baculovirus expression system (13.Haskins J. Gu L. Wittchen E.S. Hibbard J. Stevenson B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Sf9 culture supernatant, which contains viral particles encoding a His-tagged ZO-2, was a generous gift from Dr. Bruce R. Stevenson (University of Alberta, Alberta, Canada). Sf9 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were infected with ZO-2 cDNA containing baculovirus for 48 h, and then cells were harvested by centrifugation at 437 × g for 5 min. Procedures used to purify the His-tagged ZO-2 protein are the same as those for His-tagged C-Occ. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—For Western blotting analysis, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% for the in vitro binding assay, and 12.5% or 15% for limited proteolysis and co-immunoprecipitation), and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membrane was incubated with blocking solution containing 0.1% Tween 20, 5% nonfat milk, and 2.5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h. The membrane was then transferred into fresh blocking solution containing primary antibody (1 μg/ml) to occludin or ZO-2, and incubated for 1 h. Unbound and non-specifically bound antibody was removed by three changes of washing solution (0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline) over a period of 15 min. Biotinylated secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution) was then incubated with the membrane for 30 min in washing solution with 5% nonfat milk added. After washing, the membrane was incubated with either alkaline phosphatase- or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:1000 dilution) for 15 min. All incubations were performed at room temperature with gentle rocking. The immunoreactive protein bands were visualized by incubating the membrane with alkaline phosphatase substrate, BCIP/NBT (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), or horseradish peroxidase substrate, stable DAB (Research Genetics Inc.; Huntsville, AL), respectively. Limited Proteolysis—Limited proteolysis was performed at room temperature using C-Occ prior to elution from the nickel resin. An aliquot of 50 μl of C-Occ (∼5 μg) bound to the resin was used for each reaction. Trypsin (Sigma, catalog no. T-8128, EC 3.4.21.4) or a broad-range protease derived from Streptomyces griseus (Sigma, cat. P-8811, EC 3.4.24.31) was added to the solution to a final enzyme concentration of 0.5, 5, 50, or 500 μg/ml, and incubated for 5 min. The reactions were stopped by adding 50 μl of solution containing 2× SDS-PAGE buffer and 1 m of dithiothreitol prior to electrophoresis. After SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with occludin antibody, the protein masses were calculated by comparison to known protein markers (Sigma) using the computer program SigmaGel (Jandel Scientific Software, San Rafael, CA) (25SigmaGel for Windows, Rel. 1.05, 1995. Jandel Scientific Software: San Rafael, CAGoogle Scholar). To demonstrate that the digestion pattern of purified C-Occ protein is identical to that of naturally occurring cellular occludin, MDCK epithelial cells and the gray matter of human brain tissue (a source of brain microvascular endothelial cells) were lysed in high salt sodium phosphate buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate without protease inhibitors. After sonication for 1 min on ice, the solution was diluted 1:4 with 20 mm sodium phosphate solution prior to trypsin digestion (20 μg/ml for 30 min at room temperature). Protease inhibitor mixture in low salt sodium phosphate buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 125 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.4) was added as described above to stop the reaction after the incubation period, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 31,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The digestion products were isolated by immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal occludin antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.. raised using a peptide consisting of the last 150 amino acids of occludin), separated by SDS-PAGE and identified by Western blotting with the same occludin antibody. In Vitro Binding Assay—The binding assay was performed before eluting the C-Occ protein from the ProBond nickel resin. MDCK cells were used as a source of native TJ scaffolding proteins because of their high level of expression. After binding of total soluble C-Occ protein from bacterial lysate to nickel resin and washing with high salt sodium phosphate buffer containing 100 mm imidazole, an aliquot of resin (100 μl) was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and equilibrated with low salt sodium phosphate buffer. Tight junction proteins were extracted from confluent MDCK monolayers using high salt sodium phosphate buffer containing a high concentration of non-ionic detergents (1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). These relatively severe lysis conditions are required to extract and separate TJ proteins due to the high binding affinity of the complex to the cell cytoskeleton under native conditions. Total MDCK cell lysate was then diluted with 20 mm sodium phosphate to reduce salt and detergent concentrations to 125 mm chloride, 0.25% Nonidet P-40 and 0.125% deoxycholate to produce conditions favorable for the re-association of TJ proteins. The diluted samples were incubated with the C-Occ-charged resin for 4-6 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The resin was washed with low salt sodium phosphate buffer 5 times (1 ml each), and then 100 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added to the nickel resin and boiled for 10 min before centrifugation to separate the supernatant for electrophoresis. The His tag region alone, expressed in bacteria containing the original pRSETA plasmid without the occludin insert, was used as a negative control for the binding assay. Immunoprecipitation (IP)—MDCK cell lysate (as described above) was diluted with 20 mm sodium phosphate to a final chloride concentration of 125 mm, and then incubated with 50 μl of protein G-conjugated agarose (Roche Applied Science) in the presence of 5 μg of antibody to either occludin, ZO-2 or GFAP (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 4 h at 4 °C. The antibody-bound molecules were then separated from unbound ones by centrifugation at 2940 × g for 10 s. The supernatant was used as a negative control in the binding assay, and the GFAP antibody (directed against an antigen not present in MDCK cells) was used as a non-relevant antibody control. The protein G-agarose was finally washed five times with 1 ml of buffer each time. It was followed by the addition of 100 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and boiling for 10 min to solubilize the attached proteins and centrifugation to remove the agarose. The supernatant was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. In the co-IP experiments, the purified C-Occ was treated with trypsin (5 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature, and then protease inhibitor mixture was added to inactivate trypsin. The resultant solution was incubated with diluted MDCK cell lysate for 2 h at 4 °C prior to immunoprecipitation with ZO-2 antibody according to the above protocol. Amino Acid Sequencing—The purified C-Occ was digested with trypsin (50 μg/ml) for 5 min at room temperature, separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 to identify the protein bands and then destained with a solution containing 30% methanol and 10% acetic acid in water. The outlined protein bands were cut out from the membrane and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation (26.Edman P. Begg G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2410) Google Scholar) using the 494/HT PROCISE Sequencing System (Applied Biosystems). Peptide Mass Fingerprinting—After enzymatic digestion of C-Occ (∼5 μg/50 μl) with trypsin (50 μg/ml for 5 min at room temperature), the peptide fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, and each individual protein band was eluted and digested with chymotrypsin (20 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 8 h. The enzyme was then inactivated using trifluoroacetic acid to adjust the pH between 2 and 3. The peptide samples were cleaned using a reversed-phase Zip-TipC18 (Millipore) and eluted with 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, mixed with the ionization matrix and spotted on specimen grids for mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed using a Voyager-DE Elite MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), operated in the positive ion mode using angiotensin as the calibrant. Ionization of the peptide species under study was produced by pulses from a 337-nm nitrogen laser, and an accelerating voltage of 20 kV was used. The ionization matrix for this analysis was α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid dissolved in a 1:1 water/acetonitrile mixture. A minimum of 100 laser pulses was obtained, and the results were averaged to produce the resulting output spectrum. The spectra were identified by comparing the masses of the peaks with the fingerprint database generated from the mass calculation of each predicted chymotrypsin-digested fragment using the Peptide Mass program from ExPASy (27.Wilkins M.R. Lindskog I. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Sanchez J.C. Hochstrasser D.F. Appel R.D. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism (CD)—CD analysis of the purified His-tagged protein (in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.4) was performed using an Aviv 60DS spectropolarimeter (Aviv Associates, Lakewood, New Jersey). Measurements were made using a quartz microcell with a path length of 0.1 cm. Three scans from 185 to 260 nm were recorded at a speed of 0.5 nm/s, with a 0.5-nm interval. The scans were averaged and corrected by subtracting a buffer baseline (28.Cheng X. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The relative percentages of secondary structures were determined using the CDFIT program (29.Johnson W.C. Proteins. 1999; 35: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Secondary Structural Prediction—Secondary structure prediction of the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of human occludin was performed using internet server-based programs, PHD (30.Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Jpred (31.Cuff J.A. Clamp M.E. Siddiqui A.S. Finlay M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Interaction between ZO-2 and dN-Occ—In each binding reaction, purified ZO-2 was immobilized on protein A/G-agarose using 2 μg of ZO-2 antibody, and then incubated with various concentrations of dN-Occ ranging from 1 to 100 μm. This range of dN-Occ concentration was used based on preliminary studies using a broader concentration range from 10 nm to 150 μm. Irrelevant antibody to GFAP was used as a control to estimate nonspecific binding. The binding reactions were performed with gentle rocking at 4 °C for 3 h. Protein A/G-agarose with bound (ZO-2)-(dN-Occ) complexes was separated from free dN-Occ by centrifugation at 2940 × g for 2 min and washing the agarose pellet twice with low salt sodium phosphate binding buffer. The agarose with attached protein complexes was boiled for 10 min in 75 μl of 1× SDS loading buffer before separating the proteins by electrophoresis (7.5% gel for ZO-2 and 12.5% for dN-Occ). To visualize the specific protein bands, separated proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western blotting as described above. The intensity of each protein band was analyzed using SigmaGel software (Jandel Scientific Software, San Rafael, CA), and fitting of the binding data was performed using Sigmaplot (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) to estimate the association constants and stoichiometry, using the model shown by Equation 1,Z+On⇆Z(O)n(Eq. 1) and the association constant is defined by Equation 2.Ka=[Y]/[Z]×[X]n(Eq. 2) In Equation 2, Ka is the association constant, [Y] is the concentration of bound dN-Occ, [X] is the concentration of free dN-Occ, [Z] is the immobilized ZO-2 concentration, which is constant in each reaction as measured by Western blotting, and n is the number of dN-Occ molecules binding to each molecule of ZO-2. Concentrations of bound dN-Occ were determined by interpolation of the band intensities in a standard curve constructed from the Western blot of a series of dN-Occ dilutions of known concentration. Limited Proteolysis of the C-Occ Protein—A structural domain is, by definition, obtained as a stable proteolytic core, while interdomain sequences are generally susceptible to digestion by different proteases. Limited proteolysis can therefore be used to obtain the shortest segments of occludin that contain compact structural domains. Two different enzyme preparations, trypsin (T), and protease, were used in these experiments. Trypsin cleaves peptides at specific amino acids (lysine and arginine). Protease used here is a crude preparation from S. griseus that has a broader range of peptide cleavage. The use of these two enzyme preparations provides two independent methods of limited proteolysis and several different types of protease activity to test for shorter functional fragments than those generated by trypsin proteolysis alone. Results of limited proteolysis of the purified C-Occ protein are shown in Fig. 1. When a low concentration of trypsin (0.5 μg/ml) was used to cleave C-Occ attached to the nickel resin, the product consisted of essentially the entire C-Occ peptide without smaller fragments. With a higher concentration (5 μg/ml), however, C-Occ was cleaved"
