https://openalex.org/W2037233574,"The normal breathing rhythm in mammals is hypothesized to be generated by neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R)-expressing neurons in the preBötzinger complex (preBötC), a medullary region proposed to contain the kernel of the circuits generating respiration. If this hypothesis is correct, then complete destruction of preBötC NK1R neurons should severely perturb and perhaps even fatally arrest breathing. Here we show that specific and near complete bilateral (but not unilateral) destruction of preBötC NK1R neurons results in both an ataxic breathing pattern with markedly altered blood gases and pH, and pathological responses to challenges such as hyperoxia, hypoxia and anesthesia. Thus, these approximately 600 neurons seem necessary for the generation of normal breathing in rats."

https://openalex.org/W1620415063,"Entangled photon pairs-discrete light quanta that exhibit non-classical correlations-play a crucial role in quantum information science (for example, in demonstrations of quantum non-locality, quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography). At the macroscopic optical-field level non-classical correlations can also be important, as in the case of squeezed light, entangled light beams and teleportation of continuous quantum variables. Here we use stimulated parametric down-conversion to study entangled states of light that bridge the gap between discrete and macroscopic optical quantum correlations. We demonstrate experimentally the onset of laser-like action for entangled photons, through the creation and amplification of the spin-1/2 and spin-1 singlet states consisting of two and four photons, respectively. This entanglement structure holds great promise in quantum information science where there is a strong demand for entangled states of increasing complexity."

https://openalex.org/W1548710445,"The detection of massive planets orbiting nearby stars has become almost routine, but current techniques are as yet unable to detect terrestrial planets with masses comparable to the Earth's. Future space-based observatories to detect Earth-like planets are being planned. Terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zones of stars-where planetary surface conditions are compatible with the presence of liquid water-are of enormous interest because they might have global environments similar to Earth's and even harbour life. The light scattered by such a planet will vary in intensity and colour as the planet rotates; the resulting light curve will contain information about the planet's surface and atmospheric properties. Here we report a model that predicts features that should be discernible in the light curve obtained by low-precision photometry. For extrasolar planets similar to Earth, we expect daily flux variations of up to hundreds of per cent, depending sensitively on ice and cloud cover as well as seasonal variations. This suggests that the meteorological variability, composition of the surface (for example, ocean versus land fraction) and rotation period of an Earth-like planet could be derived from photometric observations. Even signatures of Earth-like plant life could be constrained or possibly, with further study, even uniquely determined."

Here we describe a new self-assembling domain pattern on a solid surface that involves two surface structures of lead on copper. The evolution of the system agrees with theoretical predictions3,4,5, enabling us to probe the interatomic force parameters that are crucial to the process."

https://openalex.org/W2040098150,"Angiotensin II (Ang II) exerts contractile and trophic effects in glomerular mesangial cells (MCs). One potential downstream target of Ang II is the protein kinase Akt/protein kinase B (PKB). We investigated the effect of Ang II on Akt/PKB activity in MCs. Ang II causes rapid activation of Akt/PKB (5-10 min) but delayed activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) (30 min). Activation of Akt/PKB by Ang II was not abrogated by the PI3-K inhibitors or by the introduction of a dominant negative PI3-K, indicating that in MCs, PI3-K is not an upstream mediator of Akt/PKB activation by Ang II. Incubation of MCs with phospholipase A2 inhibitors also blocked Akt/PKB activation by Ang II. AA mimicked the effect of Ang II. Inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-, lipoxyogenase-, and cytochrome P450-dependent metabolism did not influence AA-induced Akt/PKB activation. However, the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine and diphenylene iodonium inhibited both AA- and Ang II-induced Akt/PKB activation. Dominant negative mutant of Akt/PKB or antioxidants, but not the dominant negative form of PI3-K, inhibited Ang II-induced protein synthesis and cell hypertrophy. These data provide the first evidence that Ang II induces protein synthesis and hypertrophy in MCs through AA/redox-dependent pathway and Akt/PKB activation independent of PI3-K."

Angiogenesis involves the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells. We have investigated the role of the growth suppressor p27(Kip1) (p27) on endothelial cell function in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo. We have generated Ad-TetON, a replication-deficient adenovirus that constitutively expresses the reverse tet-responsive transcriptional activator, and Ad-TRE-p27, which drives expression of p27 under the control of the tet response element. Western blot analysis demonstrated doxycycline-dependent overexpression of p27 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) coinfected with Ad-TetON and Ad-TRE-p27, which resulted in a marked inhibition of DNA replication and cell migration in vitro. Inducible overexpression of p27 in cultured HUVECs inhibited the formation of tubelike structures and, when applied in a murine model of hind limb ischemia, reduced hind limb blood flow recovery and capillary density. These findings thus underscore a novel role of p27 in regulating endothelial cell migration in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo, suggesting a novel anti-angiogenic therapy based on inducible p27 overexpression."
https://openalex.org/W1967068525,"In eukaryotic cells the nuclear envelope (NE) serves as a functional barrier between cytosol and nucleoplasm perforated by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Both active and passive transport of ions and macromolecules are thought to be mediated by the centrally located large NPC channel. However, 3-dimensional imaging of NPCs based on electron microscopy indicates the existence of additional small channels of unknown function located in the NPC periphery. By means of the recently developed nuclear hourglass technique that measures NE electrical conductance, we evaluated passive electrically driven transport through NPCs. In isolated Xenopus laevis oocyte nuclei, we varied ambient Ca2+ and ATP in the cytosolic solution and/or chelated Ca2+ in the perinuclear stores in order to assess the role of Ca2+ in regulating passive ion transport. We noticed that NE electrical conductance is large under conditions where macromolecule permeability is known to be low. In addition, atomic force microscopy applied to native NPCs detects multiple small pores in the NPC periphery consistent with channel openings. Peripheral pores were detectable only in the presence of ATP. We conclude that NPC transport of ions and macromolecules occurs through different routes. We present a model in which NE ion flux does not occur through the central NPC channel but rather through Ca2+- and ATP-activated peripheral channels of individual NPCs."

https://openalex.org/W2073400284,"Adenosine exerts a potent cardioprotective effect that is mediated by adenosine A1 and A3 receptors. The signaling pathways activated by the A1 and A3 receptors are distinct and involve selective coupling to phospholipases C and D, respectively. The objective of our study was to elucidate the signaling mechanism that mediates the coupling of each receptor to its respective phospholipase and to test the role of RhoA as a novel mediator leading from adenosine receptors to cardioprotection. C3 transferase and dominant negative RhoA (RhoAT19N) blocked the A3 receptor-mediated phospholipase D activation and cardioprotection but had no effect on A1 receptor-mediated phospholipase C activation or cardioprotection. In contrast, pertussis toxin treatment caused a greater inhibition of the diacylglycerol accumulation induced by the A1 agonist than by the A3 agonist, and it completely abrogated the A1 agonist-mediated cardioprotection. Thus, adenosine A1 and A3 receptors are linked to different G-proteins. The A3 receptor is coupled via RhoA to activate phospholipase D in exerting its cardioprotective effect, whereas the A1 receptor is linked via Gi to phospholipase C to produce cardioprotective responses. The present study identifies a novel role for RhoA and further suggests its importance in regulating cardiac cellular function."

https://openalex.org/W1674709815,"If biology were just a matter of gathering data about a fixed reality, there would probably be no need for theory in biology. But, basically it is a new idea that makes some significance to the society. Now, more than ever, we need to acknowledge the need for what Bush Pere referred to as “the vision thing.” We’re not just talking about discoveries, new techniques, and Big Ideas – all of which require thought, and often hypothesis. Now we are entering a new phase in biology, where computer modeling can create virtual realities – and even predict and shape real reality. It’s a brave new world, and without theorists to reflect on where it’s all going, it could get scary. (Summary is not from Nature; added with the permission by Himalayan Journal of Sciences ).

https://openalex.org/W2167011321,"Cardiomyocyte development switches from hyperplasmic to hypertrophic growth between postnatal days 3 and 4 in rats. The mechanisms responsible for this transition have been controversial. beta-Adrenergic receptor (betaAR) activation of mitogenic responses in vitro has been reported. We hypothesized that tonic activation of the betaAR signaling regulates cell division in neonatal cardiomyocytes via effects on signaling kinases known to be important in cell cycle regulation. The purpose of the current study was to elucidate the roles of betaAR in rat cardiomyocyte growth in vivo. We demonstrated that betaAR blockade induced a significant reduction in cardiomyocyte proliferation as measured by the BrdU labeling index. Blockade of betaAR did not affect p38 or p44/42 MAPK activities. We further demonstrated that betaAR blockade induced a prompt deactivation of the p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70 S6K). To confirm these results, we measured p70 S6K activity directly. Basal activity of p70 S6K in neonatal cardiomyocytes was fourfold higher than that of insulin-treated adult rat liver. The activity of p70 S6K was reduced by 60% within 1 min after betaAR blockade. We conclude that the betaAR are involved in regulation of neonatal cardiomyocyte proliferation and that this mitogenic control may be mediated via the p70 S6K pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2067258284,"Inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and HIV protease are effective mechanisms for anti-retroviral agents, and the combined use of mechanistically different medications has markedly improved the treatment of HIV infected patients. The active metabolite of mercaptopurine and thioguanine (TG), deoxythioguanosine triphosphate, was shown to be incorporated into DNA by the polymerase function of HIV-1 RT and then to abrogate RNA cleavage by HIV-1 RNaseH. Treatment of human lymphocyte cultures with thioguanine produced substantial inhibition of HIV replication (IC(50)=0.035 microM, IC(95)=15.4 microM), with minimal toxicity to host lymphocytes (<10% at 15.4 microM TG, P<0.000005). Furthermore, low concentrations of TG and zidovudine were synergistic in inhibiting HIV replication in human lymphocytes (synergy volume=19 microM(2)%), without additive cytotoxicity to host lymphocytes. Thus, thiopurines are novel anti-retroviral agents that alter the DNA-RNA substrates for HIV RNaseH, thereby abrogating early stages of HIV replication."
