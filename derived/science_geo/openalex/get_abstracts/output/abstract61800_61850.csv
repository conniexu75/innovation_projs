https://openalex.org/W2090202986,"BCG is almost the only agent now used as the immuno-accelerator of cell-mediated responses1'3, but it has various biological side effects and a complicated chemical structure, so that it is not necessarily the most suitable agent. We reported that lentinan4,5 and pachymaran6 strongly inhibited the growth of transplanted tumours in mice, and these two polysaccharides are worth considering as excellent immuno-accelerators."

The mouse-MTV system is a useful model in the search for the hypothetical human mammary tumour virus (HMTV) causing the parallel disease in women. B particles similar in morphology to MTV were observed in negatively stained preparations of human milk by Moore et al.1, and there seemed to be a connexion between the appearance of particles in the milk and the incidence of breast cancer among women."

https://openalex.org/W1974481596,"THE withdrawal of ovarian progesterone at the end of pregnancy seems to be the essential step in the initiation of lactation in pregnant rats1–5. Although there is a decrease of plasma progesterone concentration before parturition6,7, the mechanisms involved in the regression of the corpus luteum at parturition are unknown. It is known8–10 that the uterus is concerned with the regression of the corpus luteum in the rat and the uterine luteolytic seems to involve a substance transported in the blood10. The discovery of prostaglandins in menstrual fluid and human endometrium11,12 and the luteolytic action of prostaglandin F2 (PGF2α) demonstrated in pseudopregnant rats13 and normal guinea-pig14 indicate a possible participation of prostaglandin at the end of pregnancy. The high concentration of PGF2α in the amniotic fluid during labour15 gives support to this hypothesis."

https://openalex.org/W2086838426,"Primitive cells of (C3H x C57BL/10)F(1) mouse bone marrow, participating with thymocytes in immune responses to sheep erythrocytes, are already committed to the immunoglobulin M or immunoglobulin G antibody class. By equilibrium centrifugation in discontinuous gradients of bovine serum albumin, cells responsible for production of IgM immunocytes migrate to the denser regions, whereas those responsible for IgG immunocytes remain in the lower density regions."

Contaminated birds lay eggs with abnormally thin, insufficiently calcified shells, so that there is increased egg breakage and embryonic death4–9. Although adult mortality, abnormal behaviour, delayed ovulation and nesting, egg eating, and failure to lay eggs also sometimes result from such contamination1–3,8–11, the thin eggshell phenomenon is the chief cause of the declines in population3,6,8."

https://openalex.org/W3209805835,"The goals in bone marrow transplantation are its application to the treatment of diseases arising in the blood-forming tissues of man. Techniques for procuring and grafting marrow are of the needle-and-syringe type and are based on the normal physiological processes in which stem cells circulate through blood and other fluids of the mammalian organism. Destruction of bone marrow by irradiation, chemicals, or unknown agencies provides the immediate experimental system for demonstrating the therapeutic value of marrow transplants. Genetic diseases characterized by abnormal marrow function are also modifiable by grafts of blood-forming tissues. Studies with identical twins are critical experiments for showing the clinical value of grafts, even though the transplanted cells cannot be identified by the usual marker techniques. Among the best results seen with marrow grafting is the presumed cure of certain rare hereditary immune-deficiency disorders of children. A major problem in bone marrow transplantation-one that delays its wider clinical application-is the immune reaction from cells growing out of the foreign transplant which attack the host (the graft-versus-host reaction). Attempts to use a graft-versus-host response to eliminate tumor cells is a part of the marrow research program. The history of the processes that led to some of the achieved goals in marrow grafting shows the usual multicentric origin of an idea. Certain individuals play critical roles in developing the idea. Finally, a body of knowledge is accumulated that opens up or limits prospects for the future. In bone marrow transplantati on, future achievements will depend in part on the progress that is made in the areas of cell separation, bone marrow banking, and tissue culture."

https://openalex.org/W2063855735,"L-ASPARAGINASE has been used to treat various neoplasms in man and animals1–4, and was at first believed to act only on malignant cells which are dependent on asparagine. Clinical investigations, however, indicated that L-asparaginase could itself be antigenic5 and have serious side effects. Moreover, L-asparaginase has been found to lead to suppression of phyto-haemagglutinin-induced blastogenesis of human lymphocytes6–8. Depression of the immune response to sheep red blood cells in mice treated with the enzyme has been reported9. Inhibition of the graft versus host reaction in rats and mice10 as well as reduction of the immune reactivity to an allografted tumour11 have also been observed."

https://openalex.org/W2048070491,"THE ability to estimate accurately the time interval until the juncture of an observer with an object moving with relative radial velocity towards the observer seems to be highly developed in humans and many animals. In many practical situations, of probable importance for survival, it is not the distance of the object from the observer which is of interest, nor is it the velocity of the object, but rather the ratio of the two, which gives the time taken by the object to reach the observer. The importance of this parameter has certainly been renewed in the age of the motor car. The popularity of ball games may be partly due to the exercise of this faculty otherwise dormant in a sedentary era."
