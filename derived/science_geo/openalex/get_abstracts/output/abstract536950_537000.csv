The efficiency of this process, however, is often low because of electron-electron scattering. Wu et al. demonstrate a pathway that allows the plasmon to directly excite an electron in a strongly coupled semiconductor acceptor (see the Perspective by Kale). Cadmiun selenide nanorods bearing gold nanoparticles on their ends strongly damped plasmons via interfacial electron transfer with a quantum efficiency exceeding 24%.

However, genuine 2D heterostructure devices remain limited because of impurity-involved transfer process and metastable and inhomogeneous heterostructure formation. We used laser-induced phase patterning, a polymorph engineering, to fabricate an ohmic heterophase homojunction between semiconducting hexagonal (2H) and metallic monoclinic (1T') molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2) that is stable up to 300°C and increases the carrier mobility of the MoTe2 transistor by a factor of about 50, while retaining a high on/off current ratio of 10(6). In situ scanning transmission electron microscopy results combined with theoretical calculations reveal that the Te vacancy triggers the local phase transition in MoTe2, achieving a true 2D device with an ohmic contact."

How genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity affects tumor evolution and clinical progression is unknown. The precise nature of the environmental factors that influence this heterogeneity is also yet to be characterized. Nature Medicine, Nature Biotechnology and the Volkswagen Foundation organized a meeting focused on identifying the obstacles that need to be overcome to advance translational research in and tumor heterogeneity. Once these key questions were established, the attendees devised potential solutions. Their ideas are presented here."

Mussel adhesion, for example, is based on the overproduction of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and proteins with a high abundance of cationic amine residues such as lysine. Using bacterial iron chelators consisting of paired DOPA and lysine groups as analogs for the mussel proteins, Maier et al. show that these two functional groups synergistically enhance interfacial adhesion (see the Perspective by Wilker). The lysine appears to displace hydrated cations from the surface, thus giving a dry patch for better adhesion. Science , this issue p. 628 ; see also p. 582"

We quantified changing flood risk due to extreme events using an integrated set of global environmental, geophysical, and social indicators. Although risks are distributed across all levels of economic development, wealthy countries effectively limit their present-day threat by gross domestic product-enabled infrastructure and coastal defense investments. In an energy-constrained future, such protections will probably prove to be unsustainable, raising relative risks by four to eight times in the Mississippi and Rhine deltas and by one-and-a-half to four times in the Chao Phraya and Yangtze deltas. The current emphasis on short-term solutions for the world's deltas will greatly constrain options for designing sustainable solutions in the long term."
https://openalex.org/W1904847174,"Cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43, accompanied by its nuclear clearance, is a key common pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD). However, a limited understanding of this RNA-binding protein (RBP) impedes the clarification of pathogenic mechanisms underlying TDP-43 proteinopathy. In contrast to RBPs that regulate splicing of conserved exons, we found that TDP-43 repressed the splicing of nonconserved cryptic exons, maintaining intron integrity. When TDP-43 was depleted from mouse embryonic stem cells, these cryptic exons were spliced into messenger RNAs, often disrupting their translation and promoting nonsense-mediated decay. Moreover, enforced repression of cryptic exons prevented cell death in TDP-43-deficient cells. Furthermore, repression of cryptic exons was impaired in ALS-FTD cases, suggesting that this splicing defect could potentially underlie TDP-43 proteinopathy."

The nature of the rupture limited damage to regular dwellings but generated shaking that collapsed taller structures. Science , this issue p. 1091"
https://openalex.org/W1555759181,"Misapplication of statistical data analysis is a common cause of spurious discoveries in scientific research. Existing approaches to ensuring the validity of inferences drawn from data assume a fixed procedure to be performed, selected before the data are examined. In common practice, however, data analysis is an intrinsically adaptive process, with new analyses generated on the basis of data exploration, as well as the results of previous analyses on the same data. We demonstrate a new approach for addressing the challenges of adaptivity based on insights from privacy-preserving data analysis. As an application, we show how to safely reuse a holdout data set many times to validate the results of adaptively chosen analyses."

A single dose of the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus–Ebola vaccine protects nonhuman primates, acting primarily through antibody responses. Marzi et al. found that this vaccine generates a robust immune response in macaques to a West African strain of Ebola virus within days of immunization (see the Perspective by Klenk and Becker). Innate immune responses developed in as little as 3 days and increased the chances of survival, with complete antibody protection acquired 7 days after immunization.

https://openalex.org/W1899620471,"Quorum sensing (QS) plays a vital role in regulating the virulence factor of many food borne pathogens, which causes severe public health risk. Therefore, interrupting the QS signaling pathway may be an attractive strategy to combat microbial infections. In the current study QS inhibitory activity of quercetin and its anti-biofilm property was assessed against food-borne pathogens using a bio-sensor strain. In addition in-silico techniques like molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies were applied to screen the quercetin’s potentiality as QS inhibitor. Quercetin (80μg/ml) showed the significant reduction in QS-dependent phenotypes like violacein production, biofilm formation, exopolysaccharide (EPS) production, motility and alginate production in a concentration-dependent manner. Synergistic activity of conventional antibiotics with quercetin enhanced the susceptibility of all tested pathogens. Furthermore, Molecular docking analysis revealed that quercetin binds more rigidly with LasR receptor protein than the signaling compound with docking score of -9.17Kcal/mol. Molecular dynamics simulation predicted that QS inhibitory activity of quercetin occurs through the conformational changes between the receptor and quercetin complex. Above findings suggest that quercetin can act as a competitive inhibitor for signaling compound towards LasR receptor pathway and can serve as a novel QS-based antibacterial/anti-biofilm drug to manage food-borne pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W1806941881,"Reliance on “hard,” human-engineered structures—“gray” infrastructure—has been the conventional way to manage water needs for economic development. But building dams, piping water, and constructing protective barriers is capital intensive and may address only a few water problems ( 1 ). Gray infrastructure often damages or eliminates biophysical processes necessary to sustain people, ecosystems and habitats, and livelihoods. Consequently, there is renewed focus on “green” infrastructure, which can be more flexible and cost effective for providing benefits besides water provision. Supplementing or integrating gray infrastructure with biophysical systems is critical to meeting current and future water needs. Gray and green infrastructures combined are synergistic and can have superior results to one or the other."
https://openalex.org/W1957129201,"Exosomes deliver functional proteins and genetic materials to neighboring cells, and have potential applications for tissue regeneration. One possible mechanism of exosome-promoted tissue regeneration is through the delivery of microRNA (miRNA). In this study, we hypothesized that exosomes derived from neuronal progenitor cells contain miRNAs that promote neuronal differentiation. We treated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) daily with exosomes derived from PC12 cells, a neuronal cell line, for 1 week. After the treatment with PC12-derived exosomes, MSCs developed neuron-like morphology, and gene and protein expressions of neuronal markers were upregulated. Microarray analysis showed that the expression of miR-125b, which is known to play a role in neuronal differentiation of stem cells, was much higher in PC12-derived exosomes than in exosomes from B16-F10 melanoma cells. These results suggest that the delivery of miRNAs contained in PC12-derived exosomes is a possible mechanism explaining the neuronal differentiation of MSC."
https://openalex.org/W2104967016,"In Einstein's general theory of relativity, time depends locally on gravity; in standard quantum theory, time is global-all clocks ""tick"" uniformly. We demonstrate a new tool for investigating time in the overlap of these two theories: a self-interfering clock, comprising two atomic spin states. We prepare the clock in a spatial superposition of quantum wave packets, which evolve coherently along two paths into a stable interference pattern. If we make the clock wave packets ""tick"" at different rates, to simulate a gravitational time lag, the clock time along each path yields ""which path"" information, degrading the pattern's visibility. In contrast, in standard interferometry, time cannot yield ""which path"" information. This proof-of-principle experiment may have implications for the study of time and general relativity and their impact on fundamental effects such as decoherence and the emergence of a classical world."

https://openalex.org/W1912617684,"The toxicity evaluation of inorganic nanoparticles has been reported by an increasing number of studies, but toxicity studies concerned with biodegradable nanoparticles, especially the neurotoxicity evaluation, are still limited. For example, the potential neurotoxicity of Polysorbate 80-modified chitosan nanoparticles (Tween 80-modified chitosan nanoparticles, TmCS-NPs), one of the most widely used brain targeting vehicles, remains unknown. In the present study, TmCS-NPs with a particle size of 240 nm were firstly prepared by ionic cross-linking of chitosan with tripolyphosphate. Then, these TmCS-NPs were demonstrated to be entered into the brain and specially deposited in the frontal cortex and cerebellum after systemic injection. Moreover, the concentration of TmCS-NPs in these two regions was found to decrease over time. Although no obvious changes were observed for oxidative stress in the in vivo rat model, the body weight was found to remarkably decreased in a dose-dependent manner after exposure to TmCS-NPs for seven days. Besides, apoptosis and necrosis of neurons, slight inflammatory response in the frontal cortex, and decrease of GFAP expression in the cerebellum were also detected in mouse injected with TmCS-NPs. This study is the first report on the sub-brain biodistribution and neurotoxicity studies of TmCS-NPs. Our results provide new insights into the toxicity evaluation of nanoparticles and our findings would help contribute to a better understanding of the neurotoxicity of biodegradable nanomaterials used in pharmaceutics."
https://openalex.org/W1744869172,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive disease with very few effective treatments. The key effector cells in fibrosis are believed to be fibroblasts, which differentiate to a contractile myofibroblast phenotype with enhanced capacity to proliferate and produce extracellular matrix. The role of the lung epithelium in fibrosis is unclear. While there is evidence that the epithelium is disrupted in IPF, it is not known whether this is a cause or a result of the fibroblast pathology. We hypothesized that healthy epithelial cells are required to maintain normal lung homeostasis and can inhibit the activation and differentiation of lung fibroblasts to the myofibroblast phenotype. To investigate this hypothesis, we employed a novel co-culture model with primary human lung epithelial cells and fibroblasts to investigate whether epithelial cells inhibit myofibroblast differentiation.In the presence of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, fibroblasts co-cultured with epithelial cells expressed significantly less α-smooth muscle actin and collagen and showed marked reduction in cell migration, collagen gel contraction, and cell proliferation compared to fibroblasts grown without epithelial cells. Epithelial cells from non-matching tissue origins were capable of inhibiting TGF-β induced myofibroblast differentiation in lung, keloid and Graves' orbital fibroblasts. TGF-β promoted production of prostaglandin (PG) E2 in lung epithelial cells, and a PGE2 neutralizing antibody blocked the protective effect of epithelial cell co-culture.We provide the first direct experimental evidence that lung epithelial cells inhibit TGF-β induced myofibroblast differentiation and pro-fibrotic phenotypes in fibroblasts. This effect is not restricted by tissue origin, and is mediated, at least in part, by PGE2. Our data support the hypothesis that the epithelium plays a crucial role in maintaining lung homeostasis, and that damaged and/ or dysfunctional epithelium contributes to the development of fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W1639254704,"Having unprotected sex with multiple sexual partners (MSP) is the greatest risk factor for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among youths. Young people with MSPs are less likely to use a condom and the greater the risk for STIs. This study examines the associated risk factors of STIs and multiple sexual partnerships among youths aged 15-24 years.The Malawi Demographic Health Survey 2010 data was used. Out of a sample of 2,987 males and 9,559 females aged 15-24 years, 2,026 males and 6,470 females were considered in the study. Chi square test and logistic regression techniques were performed. Analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.The results indicate that 1,399 (69.0%) males and 2,290 (35.4%) females reported multiple sexual partnerships (MSP). Within the rural area, females (n = 1779) were more likely to report MSP than males (n = 1082) and within the urban areas, a higher proportion of females (n = 511) still reported MSP, with males (n = 316). About 78% rural females aged 20-24 years, and about 79% rural males aged 15-19 years reported MSP. The likelihood of MSP was higher among females in the poorest households (OR = 1.31), being married (OR = 5.71) and Catholic males (OR = 1.63), who were married (OR = 1.59). Catholic males (OR = 1.82) in the rural areas, who were married (OR = 1.80) and rural females in the northern region (OR = 1.26) were more likely to have MSP. The odds ratios were higher among urban females in the poorest (OR = 3.45) households who were married (OR = 4.22).Having more than one sexual partner increases the risk of STIs and sexuality education programs should be introduced that emphasize the danger that surrounds MSP."
https://openalex.org/W1903958070,"Studying of the effects of low doses of γ-irradiation is a crucial issue in different areas of interest, from environmental safety and industrial monitoring to aerospace and medicine. The goal of this work is to identify changes of lifespan and expression stress-sensitive genes in Drosophila melanogaster, exposed to low doses of γ-irradiation (5 – 40 cGy) on the imaginal stage of development. Although some changes in life extensity in males were identified (the effect of hormesis after the exposure to 5, 10 and 40 cGy) as well as in females (the effect of hormesis after the exposure to 5 and 40 cGy), they were not caused by the organism “physiological” changes. This means that the observed changes in life expectancy are not related to the changes of organism physiological functions after the exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation. The identified changes in gene expression are not dose-dependent, there is not any proportionality between dose and its impact on expression. These results reflect nonlinear effects of low dose radiation and sex-specific radio-resistance of the postmitotic cell state of Drosophila melanogaster imago."
https://openalex.org/W1918477733,"Increased blood glucose concentrations promote reactions between glucose and proteins to form advanced glycation end-products (AGE). Circulating AGE in the blood plasma can activate the receptor for advanced end-products (RAGE), which is present on both endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). RAGE exhibits a complex signaling that involves small G-proteins and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK), which lead to increased nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activity. While RAGE signaling has been previously addressed in endothelial cells, little is known regarding its impact on the function of VSMC. Therefore, we hypothesized that RAGE signaling leads to alterations in the mechanical and functional properties of VSMC, which could contribute to complications associated with diabetes. We demonstrated that RAGE is expressed and functional in the A7r5 VSMC model, and its activation by AGE significantly increased NF-κB activity, which is known to interfere with the contractile phenotype of VSMC. The protein levels of the contraction-related transcription factor myocardin were also decreased by RAGE activation with a concomitant decrease in the mRNA and protein levels of transgelin (SM-22α), a regulator of VSMC contraction. Interestingly, we demonstrated that RAGE activation increased the overall cell rigidity, an effect that can be related to an increase in myosin activity. Finally, although RAGE stimulation amplified calcium signaling and slightly myosin activity in VSMC challenged with vasopressin, their contractile capacity was negatively affected. Overall, RAGE activation in VSMC could represent a keystone in the development of vascular diseases associated with diabetes by interfering with the contractile phenotype of VSMC through the modification of their mechanical and functional properties."
https://openalex.org/W1957881882,"The home environment is thought to play a key role in early weight trajectories, although direct evidence is limited. There is general agreement that multiple factors exert small individual effects on weight-related outcomes, so use of composite measures could demonstrate stronger effects. This study therefore examined whether composite measures reflecting the 'obesogenic' home environment are associated with diet, physical activity, TV viewing, and BMI in preschool children.Families from the Gemini cohort (n = 1096) completed a telephone interview (Home Environment Interview; HEI) when their children were 4 years old. Diet, physical activity, and TV viewing were reported at interview. Child height and weight measurements were taken by the parents (using standard scales and height charts) and reported at interview. Responses to the HEI were standardized and summed to create four composite scores representing the food (sum of 21 variables), activity (sum of 6 variables), media (sum of 5 variables), and overall (food composite/21 + activity composite/6 + media composite/5) home environments. These were categorized into 'obesogenic risk' tertiles.Children in 'higher-risk' food environments consumed less fruit (OR; 95% CI = 0.39; 0.27-0.57) and vegetables (0.47; 0.34-0.64), and more energy-dense snacks (3.48; 2.16-5.62) and sweetened drinks (3.49; 2.10-5.81) than children in 'lower-risk' food environments. Children in 'higher-risk' activity environments were less physically active (0.43; 0.32-0.59) than children in 'lower-risk' activity environments. Children in 'higher-risk' media environments watched more TV (3.51; 2.48-4.96) than children in 'lower-risk' media environments. Neither the individual nor the overall composite measures were associated with BMI.Composite measures of the obesogenic home environment were associated as expected with diet, physical activity, and TV viewing. Associations with BMI were not apparent at this age."
https://openalex.org/W1881381537,"Switchgrass is a promising biofuel feedstock due to its high biomass production and low agronomic input requirements. Because the bulk of switchgrass biomass used for biofuel production is lignocellulosic secondary walls, studies on secondary wall biosynthesis and its transcriptional regulation are imperative for designing strategies for genetic improvement of biomass production in switchgrass. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of a group of switchgrass transcription factors, including several NACs (PvSWNs) and a MYB (PvMYB46A), for their involvement in regulating secondary wall biosynthesis. PvSWNs and PvMYB46A were found to be highly expressed in stems and their expression was closely associated with sclerenchyma cells. Overexpression of PvSWNs and PvMYB46A in Arabidopsis was shown to result in activation of the biosynthetic genes for cellulose, xylan and lignin and ectopic deposition of secondary walls in normally parenchymatous cells. Transactivation and complementation studies demonstrated that PvSWNs were able to activate the SNBE-driven GUS reporter gene and effectively rescue the secondary wall defects in the Arabidopsis snd1 nst1 double mutant, indicating that they are functional orthologs of Arabidopsis SWNs. Furthermore, we showed that PvMYB46A could activate the SMRE-driven GUS reporter gene and complement the Arabidopsis myb46 myb83 double mutant, suggesting that it is a functional ortholog of Arabidopsis MYB46/MYB83. Together, these results indicate that PvSWNs and PvMYB46A are transcriptional switches involved in regulating secondary wall biosynthesis, which provides molecular tools for genetic manipulation of biomass production in switchgrass."
https://openalex.org/W2278941491,"Introduction Sickle cell anemia has many sequelae that result in emergency department (ED) use, but a minority of patients with sickle cell disease are frequent utilizers and make up the majority of ED visits. If patients who are likely to be frequent ED can be identified in steady state, they can be treated with disease modifying agents in an attempt to reduce ED use frequency. We sought to identify steady state markers for frequent ED use. Methods We identified all patients with SS/Sβ0 seen at our facilities in 2012. Health care utilization over the entire year was calculated and ED visit numbers categorized as either 0–1, 2–5, or 6 or more visits a year. Steady state and acutely active laboratory parameters were collected and analyzed using analysis of variance models and odds ratios. Results 432 adult sickle cell patients were identified, ages 18–87, 54% female, and 38% had been prescribed hydroxyurea. Of the 432 patients,192 had 0–1 visits in the year, 144 had 2–5 visits in the year, and 96 had >6 visits for a total of 2259 visits. Those who had >6 visits accounted for 1750 (77%) of the total visits for the year. When steady state laboratory markers were examined, each additional 50x109/L platelets was associated with 22% greater risk (p < .001); each 1x109/L of WBC was associated with 11% greater risk (p = .003), and each 1g/dL Hb was associated with 23% lower risk (p = .007) of >6 ED visits/year. We did not observe a relationship between baseline HbF, LDH or reticulocyte count with >6 ED visits. Conclusion Patients with elevated white blood cell counts, elevated platelet counts, and low hemoglobin levels exhibited higher risk for frequent ED utilization and could be candidates for early and aggressive therapy with disease modifying agents."

In E. coli, the reversible lysine acetylation of Acs is mainly regulated by two enzymes, the GCN5-like acetyltransferase Pat/YfiQ (15Starai V.J. Escalante-Semerena J.C.

Acs is a key enzyme in prokaryotic and eukaryotic metabolism because it synthesizes acetyl-CoA from acetate, ATP, and CoA via an acetyl-adenosine monophosphate (acetyl-AMP) intermediate and is involved in metabolism homeostasis due to its direct link with acetyl-CoA. Moreover, acetyl-CoA is involved in the energy metabolism, acting as substrate and playing a critical role in overall metabolism modulation, which makes it a key operator in the regulation of metabolic fluxes. It is important to note that in exponentially growing aerobic cultures of E. coli, cytosolic acetyl-CoA concentrations vary from 0.5 to 0.6 mm with glucose and from 0.2 to 1.7 mm with acetate as the sole carbon sources (21Bennett B.D. Kimball E.H. Gao M. Osterhout R. Van Dien S.J. Rabinowitz J.D. Absolute metabolite concentrations and implied enzyme active site occupancy in Escherichia coli.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). In this sense, the Acs enzyme is essential in limited carbon source conditions accompanied by a low extracellular concentration of acetate (22Renilla S. Bernal V. Fuhrer T. Castaño-Cerezo S.

Hence, the main objective of this study was to ascertain the kinetic and biochemical characteristics of PatZ and its effect on the regulation of Acs by lysine acetylation. This characterization will provide a deeper understanding of protein acetylation in E. coli. The 2658-bp patZ gene of E. coli BW25113 was PCR-amplified and cloned into the pRSETA plasmid. The resulting plasmid was named pRSETpatZ. Single amino acid mutant E809A was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis from pRSETpatZ using PCR. The resulting plasmid was named pRSETpatZE809A. The quintuple-mutant (substitution of lysines at positions 146, 149, 391, 447, and 635 for arginines) was obtained by sequential site-directed mutagenesis from pRSETpatZ. The resulting plasmid was named pRSERpatZ5(K→R). The 2100-bp fragment corresponding to a truncated acetyltransferase-defective patZ gene (1–2100 bp) was PCR-amplified and cloned into the pRSETA plasmid. The resulting plasmid was named pRSETpatZAcs-like. The 558-bp fragment encoding the GNAT domain of PatZ (2100–2658 bp) was cloned the same way, resulting in plasmid pRSETpatZGNAT. The Acs and CobB proteins were overexpressed using the ASKA collection plasmids (24Kitagawa M. Ara T. Arifuzzaman M. Ioka-Nakamichi T. Inamoto E. Toyonaga H. Mori H.

All molecular biology enzymes used were from Thermo Fisher Scientific. The strains, plasmids, and primers used are listed in Table 1.TABLE 1Strains, plasmids, and primers used in this study Open table in a new tab Chemically competent E. coli BL21(DE3) wild type or ΔpatZ strains were transformed by heat shock at 42 °C. Cultures were grown overnight at 30 °C with orbital shaking (200 rpm). The culture medium used was Terrific broth (12 g/liter tryptone, 24 g/liter yeast extract, 4% v/v glycerol, 0.17 m KH2PO4, and 0.72 m K2HPO4) containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) (for pRSETA) or chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml) (for ASKA plasmids). The expression was induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, 1 mm (for pRSETA), or 0.1 mm (for ASKA plasmids). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, thoroughly washed with 0.9% NaCl, and resuspended in 10 ml of binding buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole), supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor (SigmaFast Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablet, from Sigma). Cells were lysed by sonication for 2 min (20 s each pulse) on ice using a Vibra Cell sonicator (Sonicator Sonics & Materials). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Recombinant proteins were purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The cell-free extract was loaded onto a 5-ml HisGraviTrap column (GE Healthcare) and washed with washing buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm NaCl and 50 mm imidazole). The His6-tagged proteins were eluted with an elution buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm NaCl and 500 mm imidazole). The salts and imidazole from protein-containing fractions were removed with a PD-10 Sephadex G-25 column (GE Healthcare). Purified proteins were kept in storage buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl and 10% v/v glycerol) at −80 °C until used. Finally, Amicon Ultracentrifugal-15 filters (Millipore) were used to concentrate the proteins. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels using a Mini-Protean cell (Bio-Rad). For native electrophoresis, native PAGE 4–16% BisTris gels and native unstained Protein Standard (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used. The proteins were detected by Coomassie Blue staining (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Lysine-acetylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE or native-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes using a semidry transfer unit (Trans-Blot® SD Semi-Dry Transfer Cell, Bio-Rad). The membranes were incubated with a primary rabbit monoclonal anti-acetyl-lysine antibody (ImmuneChem) and a goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Finally, the membrane was incubated for 10 min with Amersham Biosciences ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Thermo Scientific). All acetyltransferase/deacetylase enzymatic experiments were performed at 37 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 with a reaction volume of 200 μl. A blank assay without enzyme under the same conditions was carried out to subtract the chemical hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA. The concentration of the TNB2− anion was determined using a molar extinction coefficient of 15.53 mm−1 cm−1, which was experimentally determined from the slopes of three independent experiments using 62.5 to 500 μm cysteine and 0.3 mm 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid as standard. The amount of purified PatZ enzyme was optimized. Experiments were carried out at a PatZ concentration of 60 nm. The initial rates of color development, obtained as milliunits of absorbance per min at 412 nm (Synergy HT spectrophotometer, Bio-Tek), were converted to units of absorbance per min by means of the PathCheck Sensor feature. Pseudo first-order kinetic parameters were determined using Prism version 6 (GraphPad) analytical software. A nonenzyme control was used to correct the background. Data for Acs and PatZ autoacetylation were fitted to the following equation: V0 = (Vmax × [S])/(Km + [S]), where V0 is the initial velocity; Vmax is the maximum velocity; [S] is the substrate concentration, and Km is the substrate concentration for half-maximal velocity. Data for acetyl-CoA were fitted to the following equation: V0 = Vmax × [S]h)/(K0.5h + [S]h), where h represents the Hill coefficient and K0.5h denotes the substrate concentration for half-maximal velocity. The parameters were determined from curves with an r2 value of 0.98. Deacetylation assays were carried out with a 3:1 CobB/PatZ molar ratio and a 1 mm NAD+ concentration. The acetyl-CoA synthetase assay used was based on the coupled assay reported by Williamson and Corkey (25Williamson J. Corkey B. Lowenstein J. Assays of Intermediates of the Citric Acid. Vol. XIII. Academic Press, New York1969: 494-497Google Scholar). AMP production was detected via an enzyme-coupled assay in which myokinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase couple AMP production to NADH oxidation. Acs was purified from E. coli BL21(DE3) ΔpatZ and preincubated with different PatZ concentrations at 0.1 mm acetyl-CoA for 1 h prior to measuring its synthetic activity. Then standard acetyl-CoA synthetase assays (0.2 ml) were performed at 37 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 containing 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 5 units of myokinase, 1 unit of pyruvate kinase, 1.5 units of lactate dehydrogenase, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm ATP, 1.5 mm CoA, 0.1 mm NADH, 5 mm acetate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. This reaction was started with the addition of 40 μl of 0.1 μm Acs. All reactions were performed in triplicate. Specific activity was calculated from the extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm−1 cm−1 for the oxidation of two molecules of NADH for each AMP released. One unit of Acs activity is defined as 1 μmol of acetyl-CoA formed per min at pH 7.5 and 37 °C. The specific activity of Acs is expressed as a percentage. A differential scanning calorimeter DSC 2920 (TA Instruments) was used for the calorimetric analysis of PatZ in different media. Samples were analyzed using a programmed heating scan rate of 1 °C min−1 from 30 to 120 °C. All experiments were carried out at 0.1 mg/ml in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and 0 to 1.5 mm acetyl-CoA. Phosphate buffer without protein was used as reference. No peaks were visible on the rescan in any case, which means that all transitions were irreversible. For data analysis and conversion, Universal Analysis Software (TA Instrument version 0.4) was used, and the collected DSC data were normalized for protein concentration. Heat capacity (Cp) was expressed in kcal mol−1 K−1 (1 cal = 4.184 J). Gel permeation analysis was performed with an HPLC (Agilent Technologies) using a Supelco Discovery Bio GFC 300 column (4.6 × 50 mm and 5 μm particle, Sigma). The eluent was 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, with a flow rate of 0.05 ml/min. The injection volume was 50 μl. The elution of proteins was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. A set of protein standards (Sigma) was used to generate standard curves from elution times of molecules with known molecular masses as follows: thyroglobulin (670 kDa), catalase (250 kDa), γ-globulin (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (44.3 kDa), and ribonuclease type AI (13.7 kDa). Blue dextran and p-aminobenzoic acid were used to determine column exclusion limits. The void volume (V0) and the total volume (VT) of the column were 0.35 and 0.8 ml, respectively. A standard curve using linear regression analysis was obtained as follows: Kav = −0.02 (Mr) + 1.44 with an r2 = 0.97. Data represent mean values with standard deviations for three separate experiments. Samples were alkylated with 100 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Proteins were digested with 0.5–1 μg of Trypsin Gold Proteomics Grade (Promega) for 3 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with 0.1% formic acid, and samples were dried using a vacuum evaporator. Tryptic peptides generated from the samples were separated and analyzed by LC/MS. An Agilent 1100 (Agilent Technologies) was equipped with a Zorbax SB-C18 HPLC column (Agilent Technologies) and connected to an Agilent Ion Trap XCT Plus mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies) using an electrospray (ESI) interface. Two mobile phases were used, phase A, composed of water/acetonitrile/formic acid (94.9:5:0.1, v/v) and phase B, consisting of water/acetonitrile/formic acid (10:89.9:0.1, v/v). The digested peptides were resuspended in 20 μl of phase A and eluted using a linear gradient from 0 to 80% phase B for 180 min and at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive mode with a capillary spray voltage of 3500 V, and a scan speed of 8100 (m/z)/s from 50 to 2200 m/z, with a target mass of 1000 m/z, and three spectra averaging. The nebulizer gas pressure was set at 15 p.s.i., and the drying gas a flow rate at 5 liters/min at a temperature of 350 °C. MS/MS data were collected in an automated data-dependent mode (AutoMS mode). Data processing was performed with Data Analysis program for LC/MSD Trap Version 3.3 (Bruker Daltonik) and Spectrum Mill MS Proteomics Workbench (Agilent Technologies) (26Moulder R. Filén J.-J.

After automatic validation of the results, the identified proteins with the sequence of the digested peptides were compiled. Peptides were considered valid with a score threshold of 8, and a percentage-scored peak intensity higher than 70%. DLS measurements were carried out in a NanoSizer ZS (Malvern Instruments), operating a laser of 632.8 nm at an angle of 173°. The autocorrelation function was processed by using the ZetaSizer version 7.03 software associated with the instrument in the CONTIN mode. This procedure determines a diffusion coefficient that is presented as a distribution of the hydrodynamic radius, Rh. The hydrodynamic measurements were carried out at 20 °C (T = 293 K) in 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 with a PatZ protein concentration of 10 μm. The experiment consisted of 12 measurements of 11 runs each, with 30 s per run, which amounted to 11 min of data acquisition time. The CONTIN analysis allows for two modalities in the distribution, expressing the amount of solute of a given Rh in terms of either contribution to scattering intensity or as mass fraction. The former is particularly sensitive to the presence of large particles even if their population is very small, whereas the latter detects the sample's major species. A limitation of DLS-derived distributions is that Rh is handled in a logarithmic scale, and peaks have, even for monodisperse samples, a merely instrumental width, so that components of a paucidisperse sample cannot be differentiated if their Rh values do not differ widely. Nonetheless, the Protein Workshop mode, specific for protein samples, of the ZetaSizer software was useful for our purposes. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were performed in a Beckman Coulter Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman-Coulter) using an An50Ti eight-hole rotor, 12-mm path length charcoal-filled Epon double-sector centerpieces, employing the UV-visible detection system. The experiments were carried out in the same buffer and temperature mentioned above with a PatZ protein concentration of 10 μm. A wavelength of 280 nm was used in the absorbance optics. Sedimentation velocity (SV) runs were carried out for 8 h at a rotor speed of 40,000 rpm using 400-μl samples in the above mentioned solvent. A series of 400 scans, without time intervals between them, was acquired for each sample. Least squares boundary modeling of the sedimentation velocity data were used to calculate sedimentation coefficient distributions with the size distribution c(s) method (28Laue T.M. Shah B.

https://openalex.org/W1948611959,"Winogradsky columns are model microbial ecosystems prepared by adding pond sediment to a clear cylinder with additional supplements and incubated with light. Environmental gradients develop within the column creating diverse niches that allow enrichment of specific bacteria. The enrichment culture can be used to study soil and sediment microbial community structure and function. In this study we used a 16S rRNA gene survey to characterize the microbial community dynamics during Winogradsky column development to determine the rate and extent of change from the source sediment community. Over a period of 60 days, the microbial community changed from the founding pond sediment population: Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, Nitrospirae, and Planctomycetes increased in relative abundance over time, while most Proteobacteria decreased in relative abundance. A unique, light-dependent surface biofilm community formed by 60 days that was less diverse and dominated by a few highly abundant bacteria. 67-72% of the surface community was comprised of highly enriched taxa that were rare in the source pond sediment, including the Cyanobacteria Anabaena, a member of the Gemmatimonadetes phylum, and a member of the Chloroflexi class Anaerolinea. This indicates that rare taxa can become abundant under appropriate environmental conditions and supports the hypothesis that rare taxa serve as a microbial seed bank. We also present preliminary findings that suggest that bacteriophages may be active in the Winogradsky community. The dynamics of certain taxa, most notably the Cyanobacteria, showed a bloom-and-decline pattern, consistent with bacteriophage predation as predicted in the kill-the-winner hypothesis. Time-lapse photography also supported the possibility of bacteriophage activity, revealing a pattern of colony clearance similar to formation of viral plaques. The Winogradsky column, a technique developed early in the history of microbial ecology to enrich soil microbes, may therefore be a useful model system to investigate both microbial and viral ecology."
https://openalex.org/W1898485904,"Vimentin (Vim) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) are important components of the intermediate filament (IF) (or nanofilament) system of astroglial cells. We conducted full-field electroretinogram (ERG) recordings and found that whereas photoreceptor responses (a-wave) were normal in uninjured GFAP(-/-)Vim(-/-) mice, b-wave amplitudes were increased. Moreover, we found that Kir (inward rectifier K(+)) channel protein expression was reduced in the retinas of GFAP(-/-)Vim(-/-) mice and that Kir-mediated current amplitudes were lower in Müller glial cells isolated from these mice. Studies have shown that the IF system, in addition, is involved in the retinal response to injury and that attenuated Müller cell reactivity and reduced photoreceptor cell loss are observed in IF-deficient mice after experimental retinal detachment. We investigated whether the lack of IF proteins would affect cell survival in a retinal ischemia-reperfusion model. We found that although cell loss was induced in both genotypes, the number of surviving cells in the inner retina was lower in IF-deficient mice. Our findings thus show that the inability to produce GFAP and Vim affects normal retinal physiology and that the effect of IF deficiency on retinal cell survival differs, depending on the underlying pathologic condition."

RanBP2 has four Ran binding domains (RBDs), two of which flank RanBP2's E3 ligase region. We thus wondered whether the small GTPase Ran is a target for RanBP2-dependent sumoylation. Indeed, Ran is sumoylated both by a reconstituted and the endogenous RanBP2 complex in semi-permeabilized cells. Generic inhibition of SUMO isopeptidases or depletion of the SUMO isopeptidase SENP1 enhances sumoylation of Ran in semi-permeabilized cells. As Ran is typically associated with transport receptors, we tested the influence of Crm1, Imp β, Transportin, and NTF2 on Ran sumoylation. Surprisingly, all inhibited Ran sumoylation. Mapping Ran sumoylation sites revealed that transport receptors may simply block access of the E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, however the acceptor lysines are perfectly accessible in Ran/NTF2 complexes. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that NTF2 prevents sumoylation by reducing RanGDP's affinity to RanBP2's RBDs to undetectable levels. Taken together, our findings indicate that RanGDP and not RanGTP is the physiological target for the RanBP2 SUMO E3 ligase complex.

https://openalex.org/W1962967416,"Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates cell growth, cell differentiation and protein synthesis. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, has been widely used as an immunosuppressant and anti-cancer drug. Recently, mTOR inhibitors have also been reported to be a potential anti-epileptic drug, which may be effective when used in young patients with genetic epilepsy. Thus, a suitable dose of rapamycin which can maintain the normal function of mTOR and has fewer side effects ideally should be identified. In the present study, we first detected changes in marker proteins of mTOR signaling pathway during development. Then we determined the dose of rapamycin by treating rats of 2 weeks of age with different doses of rapamycin for 3 days and detected its effect on mTOR pathway. Young rats were then treated with a suitable dose of rapamycin for 4 weeks and the effect of rapamycin on mTOR, development and immunity were investigated. We found that the expression of the marker proteins of mTOR pathway was changed during development in brain hippocampus and neocortex. After 3 days of treanent, 0.03 mg/kg rapamycin had no effect on phospho-S6, whereas 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg rapamycin inhibited phospho-S6 in a dose-dependent manner. However, only 1.0 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg rapamycin inhibited phospho-S6 after 4 weeks treatment of rapamycin. Parallel to this result, rats treated with 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg rapamycin had no obvious adverse effects, whereas rats treated with 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg rapamycin showed significant decreases in body, spleen and thymus weight. Additionally, rats treated with 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg rapamycin exhibited cognitive impairment and anxiety as evident by maze and open field experiments. Furthermore, the content of IL-1β, IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α in serum and cerebral cortex were significantly decreased in 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg rapamycin-treated rats. The expression of DCX was also significantly decreased in 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg rapamycin-treated rats. However, rats treated with 1.0 mg/ kg rapamycin exhibited fewer and milder side effects than those treated with 3.0 mg/kg. In summary, all these data suggest that there is not a rapamycin dose that can inhibit mTOR for epilepsy without causing any side effects, but 1 mg /kg may be the optimal dose for young rats for suppressing mTOR with relatively few side effects."
https://openalex.org/W2168773850,"The purposes of this study were to determine the following: 1) the exposure levels of municipal household waste (MHW) workers to diesel particulate matter (DPM) using elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC), total carbon (TC), black carbon (BC), and fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) as indicators; 2) the correlations among the indicators; 3) the optimal indicator for DPM; and 4) factors that influence personal exposure to DPM.A total of 72 workers in five MHW collection companies were assessed over a period of 7 days from June to September 2014. Respirable EC/OC samples were quantified using the thermal optical transmittance method. BC and PM 2.5 were measured using real-time monitors, an aethalometer and a laser photometer. All results were statistically analyzed for occupational and environmental variables to identify the exposure determinants of DPM.The geometric mean of EC, OC, TC, BC and PM 2.5 concentrations were 4.8, 39.6, 44.8, 9.1 and 62.0 μg/m3, respectively. EC concentrations were significantly correlated with the concentrations of OC, TC and BC, but not with those of PM 2.5. The exposures of the MHW collectors to EC, OC, and TC were higher than those of the drivers (p<0.05). Workers of trucks meeting Euro 3 emission standard had higher exposures to EC, OC, TC and PM 2.5 than those working on Euro 4 trucks (p<0.05). Multiple regression analysis revealed that the job task, European engine emission standard, and average driving speed were the most influential factors in determining worker exposure.We assessed MHW workers' exposure to DPM using parallel sampling of five possible indicators. Of these five indicators, EC was shown to be the most useful indicator of DPM exposure for MHW workers, and the job task, European emission standard, and average driving speed were the main determinants of EC exposure."
https://openalex.org/W1049819953,"This study was aimed to define possible predictors of overall survival in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Patients were treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), to establish an effective prognostic nomogram that could provide individualized predictions of treatment outcome in this setting. We reviewed the records of 533 patients with non-metastatic NPC who underwent IMRT with or without concurrent chemotherapy at the Department of Radiation Oncology of Sun Yat-Sen University from 2002 to 2009; none of these patients received induction or adjuvant chemotherapy. These data sets were used to construct a nomogram based on Cox regression. Nomogram performance was determined via a concordance index (C-index) and a calibration curve which was compared with the TNM staging system for NPC. The results were validated in an external cohort of 442 patients from the Department of Radiation Oncology of Wenzhou Medical College who were treated during the same period. Results showed that the greatest influence on survival were primary gross tumor volume, age, tumor stage and nodal stage (2002 Union for International Cancer Control [UICC] staging system), which were selected into the nomogram. The C-index of the nomogram for predicting survival was 0.748 (95%CI, 0.704-0.785), which was statistically higher than that of TNM staging system (0.684, P<0.001). The calibration curve exhibited agreement between nomogram-predicted and the actual observed probabilities for overall survival. In the validation cohort, the nomogram discrimination was superior to the TNM staging system (C-index: 0.768 vs 0.721; P = 0.026). In conclusion, the nomogram proposed in this study resulted in more-accurate prognostic prediction for patients with NPC after IMRT and compared favorably to the TNM staging system; this individualized information will aid in patient counseling and may be used for de-escalation trials in the future."
https://openalex.org/W1930435849,"Bacillus strains have been widely used as the companion strain of Ketogulonigenium vulgare in the process of vitamin C fermentation. Different Bacillus strains generate different effects on the growth of K. vulgare and ultimately influence the productivity. First, we identified that Bacillus endophyticus Hbe603 was an appropriate strain to cooperate with K. vulgare and the product conversion rate exceeded 90% in industrial vitamin C fermentation. Here, we report the genome sequencing of the B. endophyticus Hbe603 industrial companion strain and speculate its possible advantage in the consortium. The circular chromosome of B. endophyticus Hbe603 has a size of 4.87 Mb with GC content of 36.64% and has the highest similarity with that of Bacillus megaterium among all the bacteria with complete genomes. By comparing the distribution of COGs with that of Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus cereus and B. megaterium, B. endophyticus has less genes related to cell envelope biogenesis and signal transduction mechanisms, and more genes related to carbohydrate transport and metabolism, energy production and conversion, as well as lipid transport and metabolism. Genome-based functional studies revealed the specific capability of B. endophyticus in sporulation, transcription regulation, environmental resistance, membrane transportation, extracellular proteins and nutrients synthesis, which would be beneficial for K. vulgare. In particular, B. endophyticus lacks the Rap-Phr signal cascade system and, in part, spore coat related proteins. In addition, it has specific pathways for vitamin B12 synthesis and sorbitol metabolism. The genome analysis of the industrial B. endophyticus will help us understand its cooperative mechanism in the K. vulgare-Bacillus strain consortium to improve the fermentation of vitamin C."
https://openalex.org/W1945382840,"We estimated HIV-free infant survival and mother-to-child HIV transmission (MTCT) rates in Zimbabwe, some of the first community-based estimates from a UNAIDS priority country.In 2012 we surveyed mother-infant pairs residing in the catchment areas of 157 health facilities randomly selected from 5 of 10 provinces in Zimbabwe. Enrolled infants were born 9-18 months before the survey. We collected questionnaires, blood samples for HIV testing, and verbal autopsies for deceased mothers/infants. Estimates were assessed among i) all HIV-exposed infants, as part of an impact evaluation of Option A of the 2010 WHO guidelines (rolled out in Zimbabwe in 2011), and ii) the subgroup of infants unexposed to Option A. We compared province-level MTCT rates measured among women in the community with MTCT rates measured using program monitoring data from facilities serving those communities.Among 8568 women with known HIV serostatus, 1107 (12.9%) were HIV-infected. Among all HIV-exposed infants, HIV-free infant survival was 90.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 88.7-92.7) and MTCT was 8.8% (95% CI: 6.9-11.1). Sixty-six percent of HIV-exposed infants were still breastfeeding. Among the 762 infants born before Option A was implemented, 90.5% (95% CI: 88.1-92.5) were alive and HIV-uninfected at 9-18 months of age, and 9.1% (95%CI: 7.1-11.7) were HIV-infected. In four provinces, the community-based MTCT rate was higher than the facility-based MTCT rate. In Harare, the community and facility-based rates were 6.0% and 9.1%, respectively.By 2012 Zimbabwe had made substantial progress towards the elimination of MTCT. Our HIV-free infant survival and MTCT estimates capture HIV transmissions during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding regardless of whether or not mothers accessed health services. These estimates also provide a baseline against which to measure the impact of Option A guidelines (and subsequently Option B+)."
https://openalex.org/W1933401810,"The phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) tumor suppressor protein is regulated by various mechanisms that are not fully understood. This includes regulation by Tyr phosphorylation by a mechanism that remains elusive. Here, we show that focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylates PTEN in vitro, in cell-free systems and in cells. Furthermore, by mass spectrometry, we identified Tyr336 on PTEN as being phosphorylated by FAK. Tyr336 phosphorylation increased phosphatase activity, protein-lipid interaction, and protein stability of PTEN. In cells, including primary mouse macrophages and human cancer cell lines, FAK was found to be negatively regulated by p110δ phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), whereas the activation of FAK was positively regulated by RhoA-associated kinase (ROCK). Indeed, the phosphorylation of FAK was unexpectedly increased in macrophages derived from mice expressing kinase-dead p110δ. Pharmacologic inactivation of RhoA/ROCK reduced the phosphorylation of FAK to normal levels in cells with genetically inactivated p110δ. Likewise, pharmacologic inactivation of FAK reduced the phosphorylation of PTEN in cells expressing kinase-dead p110δ and restored the functional defects of p110δ inactivation, including Akt phosphorylation and cell proliferation. This work identifies FAK as a target of p110δ PI3K that links RhoA with PTEN and establishes for the first time that PTEN is a substrate of FAK-mediated Tyr phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1130151931,"Persistence, more recently termed the chlamydial stress response, is a viable but non-infectious state constituting a divergence from the characteristic chlamydial biphasic developmental cycle. Damage/danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are normal intracellular components or metabolites that, when released from cells, signal cellular damage/lysis. Purine metabolite DAMPs, including extracellular ATP and adenosine, inhibit chlamydial development in a species-specific manner. Viral co-infection has been shown to reversibly abrogate Chlamydia inclusion development, suggesting persistence/chlamydial stress. Because viral infection can cause host cell DAMP release, we hypothesized DAMPs may influence chlamydial development. Therefore, we examined the effect of extracellular ATP, adenosine, and cyclic AMP exposure, at 0 and 14 hours post infection, on C. pecorum and C. trachomatis serovar E development. In the absence of de novo host protein synthesis, exposure to DAMPs immediately post or at 14 hours post infection reduced inclusion size; however, the effect was less robust upon 14 hours post infection exposure. Additionally, upon exposure to DAMPs immediately post infection, bacteria per inclusion and subsequent infectivity were reduced in both Chlamydia species. These effects were reversible, and C. pecorum exhibited more pronounced recovery from DAMP exposure. Aberrant bodies, typical in virus-induced chlamydial persistence, were absent upon DAMP exposure. In the presence of de novo host protein synthesis, exposure to DAMPs immediately post infection reduced inclusion size, but only variably modulated chlamydial infectivity. Because chlamydial infection and other infections may increase local DAMP concentrations, DAMPs may influence Chlamydia infection in vivo, particularly in the context of poly-microbial infections."

This study investigated the molecular characteristics of S. lugdunensis isolates collected at our hospital and compared the characteristics of the infectious and commensal isolates. Methods We collected the S. lugdunensis isolates between 2003 and 2013. The antimicrobial resistance test, SCCmec typing, accessory gene regulator (agr) typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and δ-like hemolysin activity were performed. Results In total, 118 S. lugdunensis isolates were collected, of which 67 (56.8%) were classified into the infection group and 51 (43.2%) into the commensal group. The oxacillin resistance rate was 36.4%. The most common SCCmec types were SCCmec types V (51.4%) and II (32.6%). In total, 34 pulsotypes were identified. The PFGE typing revealed five clones (pulsotypes A, J, M, N, and P) at our hospital. Pulsotypes A and N caused the spread of high oxacillin resistance. In total, 10.2% (12 of 118) of the isolates lacked δ-like hemolysin activity. Compared with the infection group, the commensal group showed a higher percentage of multiple drug resistance and carried a higher percentage of SCCmec type II (11 of 22, 50% and 3 of 21, 14.3%) and a lower percentage of SCCmec type V (8 of 22, 36.4% and 14 of 21, 66.7%). The commensal group (27 PFGE types) showed higher genetic diversity than did the infection group (20 PFGE types). No difference was observed in the distribution of the five main pulsotypes, agr typing, and the presence of δ-like hemolysin activity between the two groups. Conclusions Five main clones were identified at our hospital. The commensal group showed higher genetic diversity, had a higher percentage of multidrug resistance, and carried a higher percentage of SCCmec type II and a lower percentage of SCCmec type V than did the infection group."
https://openalex.org/W1550963812,"Pediatric glioblastomas (pGBM), although rare, are one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in children, with tumors essentially refractory to existing treatments. Here, we describe the use of conventional and advanced in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to assess a novel orthotopic xenograft pGBM mouse (IC-3752GBM patient-derived culture) model, and to monitor the effects of the anti-cancer agent OKN-007 as an inhibitor of pGBM tumor growth. Immunohistochemistry support data is also presented for cell proliferation and tumor growth signaling. OKN-007 was found to significantly decrease tumor volumes (p<0.05) and increase animal survival (p<0.05) in all OKN-007-treated mice compared to untreated animals. In a responsive cohort of treated animals, OKN-007 was able to significantly decrease tumor volumes (p<0.0001), increase survival (p<0.001), and increase diffusion (p<0.01) and perfusion rates (p<0.05). OKN-007 also significantly reduced lipid tumor metabolism in responsive animals [(Lip1.3 and Lip0.9)-to-creatine ratio (p<0.05)], as well as significantly decrease tumor cell proliferation (p<0.05) and microvessel density (p<0.05). Furthermore, in relationship to the PDGFRα pathway, OKN-007 was able to significantly decrease SULF2 (p<0.05) and PDGFR-α (platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α) (p<0.05) immunoexpression, and significantly increase decorin expression (p<0.05) in responsive mice. This study indicates that OKN-007 may be an effective anti-cancer agent for some patients with pGBMs by inhibiting cell proliferation and angiogenesis, possibly via the PDGFRα pathway, and could be considered as an additional therapy for pediatric brain tumor patients."
https://openalex.org/W1915404152,"Recently, we found that gentle mechanical skin stimulation inhibits the micturition reflex in anesthetized rats. However, the central mechanisms underlying this inhibition have not been determined. This study aimed to clarify the central neural mechanisms underlying this inhibitory effect. In urethane-anesthetized rats, cutaneous stimuli were applied for 1 min to the skin of the perineum using an elastic polymer roller with a smooth, soft surface. Inhibition of rhythmic micturition contractions by perineal stimulation was abolished by naloxone, an antagonist of opioidergic receptors, administered into the intrathecal space of the lumbosacral spinal cord at doses of 2–20 μg but was not affected by the same doses of naloxone administered into the subarachnoid space of the cisterna magna. Next, we examined whether perineal rolling stimulation inhibited the descending and ascending limbs of the micturition reflex. Perineal rolling stimulation inhibited bladder contractions induced by electrical stimulation of the pontine micturition center (PMC) or the descending tract of the micturition reflex pathway. It also inhibited the bladder distension-induced increase in the blood flow of the dorsal cord at L5–S1, reflecting the neural activity of this area, as well as pelvic afferent-evoked field potentials in the dorsal commissure at the lumbosacral level; these areas contain long ascending neurons to the PMC. Neuronal activities in this center were also inhibited by the rolling stimulation. These results suggest that the perineal rolling stimulation activates the spinal opioidergic system and inhibits both ascending and descending transmissions of the micturition reflex pathway in the spinal cord. These inhibitions would lead to the shutting down of positive feedback between the bladder and the PMC, resulting in inhibition of the micturition reflex. Based on the central neural mechanisms we show here, gentle perineal stimulation may be applicable to several different types of overactive bladder."
https://openalex.org/W2147571480,"Monozygotic twins share identical genomic DNA and are indistinguishable using conventional genetic markers. Increasing evidence indicates that monozygotic twins are epigenetically distinct, suggesting that a comparison between DNA methylation patterns might be useful to approach this forensic problem. However, the extent of epigenetic discordance between healthy adult monozygotic twins and the stability of CpG loci within the same individual over a short time span at the whole-genome scale are not well understood. Here, we used Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchips to compare DNA methylation profiles using blood collected from 10 pairs of monozygotic twins and 8 individuals sampled at 0, 3, 6, and 9 months. Using an effective and unbiased method for calling differentially methylated (DM) CpG sites, we showed that 0.087%-1.530% of the CpG sites exhibit differential methylation in monozygotic twin pairs. We further demonstrated that, on whole-genome level, there has been no significant epigenetic drift within the same individuals for up to 9 months, including one monozygotic twin pair. However, we did identify a subset of CpG sites that vary in DNA methylation over the 9-month period. The magnitude of the intra-pair or longitudinal methylation discordance of the CpG sites inside the CpG islands is greater than those outside the CpG islands. The CpG sites located on shores appear to be more suitable for distinguishing between MZ twins."
https://openalex.org/W1080282579,"Precocene II, a constituent of essential oils, shows antijuvenile hormone activity in insects and inhibits trichothecene production in fungi. We investigated the molecular mechanism by which precocene II inhibits trichothecene production in Fusarium graminearum, the main causal agent of Fusarium head blight and trichothecene contamination in grains. Voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), a mitochondrial outer membrane protein, was identified as the precocene II-binding protein by an affinity magnetic bead method. Precocene II increased the superoxide level in mitochondria as well as the amount of oxidized mitochondrial proteins. Ascorbic acid, glutathione, and α-tocopherol promoted trichothecene production by the fungus. These antioxidants compensated for the inhibitory activity of precocene II on trichothecene production. These results suggest that the binding of precocene II to VDAC may cause high superoxide levels in mitochondria, which leads to stopping of trichothecene production."
https://openalex.org/W1089704793,"Cell transition to a more aggressive mesenchymal-like phenotype is a hallmark of cancer progression that involves different steps and requires tightly regulated cell plasticity. SPARC (Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine) is a matricellular protein that promotes this transition in various malignant cell types, including melanoma cells. We found that suppression of SPARC expression in human melanoma cells compromised cell migration, adhesion, cytoskeleton structure, and cell size. These changes involved the Akt/mTOR pathway. Re-expression of SPARC or protein addition restored all the cell features. Suppression of SPARC expression was associated with increased Rac1-GTP levels and its membrane localization. Expression of the dominant negative mutant of Rac1 counteracted almost all the changes observed in SPARC-deficient cells. Overall, these data suggest that most of the SPARC-mediated effects occurred mainly through the blockade of Rac1 activity."
https://openalex.org/W1950416369,"The human parasite Entamoeba histolytica has an active RNA interference (RNAi) pathway with an extensive repertoire of 27nt small RNAs that silence genes. However the role of this pathway in regulating amebic biology remains unknown. In this study, we address whether silencing via 27nt small RNAs may be a mechanism for controlling gene expression changes during conversion between the trophozoite and cyst stages of the parasite. We sequenced small RNA libraries generated from trophozoites, early cysts, mature cysts, and excysting cells and mapped them to the E. invadens genome. Our results show that, as in E. histolytica, small RNAs in E. invadens are largely ~27nt in length, have an unusual 5'-polyphosphate structure and mediate gene silencing. However, when comparing the libraries from each developmental time-point we found few changes in the composition of the small RNA populations. Furthermore, genes targeted by small RNAs were permanently silenced with no changes in transcript abundance during development. Thus, the E. invadens 27nt small RNA population does not mediate gene expression changes during development. In order to assess the generalizability of our observations, we examined whether small RNAs may be regulating gene expression changes during stress response in E. histolytica. Comparison of the 27nt small RNA populations from E. histolytica trophozoites from basal conditions, or after heat shock or exposure to oxidative stress showed few differences. Similar to data in E. invadens development, genes targeted by small RNAs were consistently silenced and did not change expression under tested stress conditions. Thus, the biological roles of the 27nt small RNA population in Entamoeba remain elusive. However, as the first characterization of the RNAi pathway in E. invadens these data serve as a useful resource for the study of Entamoeba development and open the door to the development of RNAi-based gene silencing tools in E. invadens."

The miR-103/107 family is preferentially expressed in the stem cell-enriched corneal limbal epithelium and plays an important role in coordinating several intrinsic characteristics of limbal epithelial stem cells. To elucidate further the mechanisms by which miRs-103/107 function in regulating limbal epithelial stem cells, we investigate the global effects of miRs-103/107 on gene expression in an unbiased manner. Using antagomirs-103/107, we knocked down endogenous miRs-103/107 in keratinocytes and conducted an mRNA profiling study. We show that miRs-103/107 target mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7 (MAP3K7) and thereby negatively regulate the p38/AP-1 pathway, which directs epithelial cells towards a differentiated state. Pharmacological inhibition of p38 increases holoclone colony formation, a measure of proliferative capacity. This suggests that the negative regulation of p38 by miRs-103/107 contributes to enhanced proliferative capacity, which is a hallmark of stem cells. Since miRs-103/107 also promote increased holoclone colony formation by regulating JNK activation through non-canonical Wnt signaling, we believe that this microRNA family preserves “stemness” by mediating the crosstalk between the Wnt/JNK and MAP3K7/p38/AP-1 pathways."

Due to the lack of valid prognostic markers for uterine leiomyosarcoma (ULMS) this study set out to investigate the value of pre-treatment CRP serum levels as prognostic parameter.Data of women with ULMS were extracted from databases of three Austrian centres for gynaecologic oncology. Pre-treatment CRP serum levels were measured and correlated with clinico-pathological parameters. Univariate and multivariable survival analyses were performed.In total, 53 patients with ULMS were included into the analysis. Mean (SD) CRP serum level was 3.46 mg/dL (3.96). Solely, an association between pre-treatment CRP serum levels and tumor size (p = 0.04) but no other clinic-pathologic parameter such as tumor stage (p = 0.16), or histological grade (p = 0.07), was observed. Univariate and multivariable survival analyses revealed that CRP serum levels (HR 2.7 [1.1-7.2], p = 0.037) and tumor stage (HR 6.1 [1.9-19.5], p = 0.002) were the only independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in patients with ULMS. Patients with high pre-treatment CRP serum levels showed impaired OS compared to women with low levels (5-year-OS rates: 22.6% and 52.3%, p = 0.007).High pre-treatment CRP serum levels were independently associated with impaired prognosis in women with ULMS and might serve as a prognostic parameter in these patients."

https://openalex.org/W1734759506,"To investigate the impact of different training backgrounds on pulmonary oxygen uptake (V̇O2) responses during all-out and supramaximal constant-velocity running exercises, nine sprinters (SPRs) and eight endurance runners (ENDs) performed an incremental test for maximal aerobic velocity (MAV) assessment and two supramaximal running exercises (1-min all-out test and constant-velocity exercise). The V̇O2 responses were continuously determined during the tests (K4b2, Cosmed, Italy). A mono-exponential function was used to describe the V̇O2 onset kinetics during constant-velocity test at 110%MAV, while during 1-min all-out test the peak of V̇O2 (V̇O2peak), the time to achieve the V̇O2peak (tV̇O2peak) and the V̇O2 decrease at last of the test was determined to characterize the V̇O2 response. During constant-velocity exercise, ENDs had a faster V̇O2 kinetics than SPRs (12.7 ± 3.0 vs. 19.3 ± 5.6 s; p < 0.001). During the 1-min all-out test, ENDs presented slower tV̇O2peak than SPRs (40.6 ± 6.8 and 28.8 ± 6.4 s, respectively; p = 0.002) and had a similar V̇O2peak relative to the V̇O2max (88 ± 8 and 83 ± 6%, respectively; p = 0.157). Finally, SPRs was the only group that presented a V̇O2 decrease in the last half of the test (-1.8 ± 2.3 and 3.5 ± 2.3 ml.kg-1.min-1, respectively; p < 0.001). In summary, SPRs have a faster V̇O2 response when maximum intensity is required and a high maximum intensity during all-out running exercise seems to lead to a higher decrease in V̇O2 in the last part of the exercise."
https://openalex.org/W1944410224,"Expression of type IV pili (Tfp), filamentous appendages emanating from the bacterial surface, is indispensable for efficient neisserial transformation. Tfp pass through the secretin pore consisting of the membrane protein PilQ. PilG is a polytopic membrane protein, conserved in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, that is required for the biogenesis of neisserial Tfp. PilG null mutants are devoid of pili and non-competent for transformation. Here, recombinant full-length, truncated and mutated variants of meningococcal PilG were overexpressed, purified and characterized. We report that meningococcal PilG directly binds DNA in vitro, detected by both an electromobility shift analysis and a solid phase overlay assay. PilG DNA binding activity was independent of the presence of the consensus DNA uptake sequence. PilG-mediated DNA binding affinity was mapped to the N-terminus and was inactivated by mutation of residues 43 to 45. Notably, reduced meningococcal transformation of DNA in vivo was observed when PilG residues 43 to 45 were substituted by alanine in situ, defining a biologically significant DNA binding domain. N-terminal PilG also interacted with the N-terminal region of PilQ, which previously was shown to bind DNA. Collectively, these data suggest that PilG and PilQ in concert bind DNA during Tfp-mediated transformation."

The evaluation results demonstrate that it allows datasets to be analyzed effectively and rapidly for research on divergence population genetics.

https://openalex.org/W1919862564,"This study investigated whether deciding to either stay with or leave a social relationship partner, based on a sequence of collaborative social interactions, is impacted by (1) observed and (2) anticipated gains and losses associated with the collaboration; and, importantly, (3) whether these effects differ between social and nonsocial contexts. In the social context, participants played an iterated collaborative economic game in which they were dependent on the successes and failures of a game partner in order to increase their monetary payoff, and in which they were free to stop collaborating with this partner whenever they chose. In Study 1, we manipulated the actual success rate of partners, and demonstrated that participants decided to stay longer with 'better' partners. In Study 2, we induced prior expectations about specific partners, while keeping the objective performance of all partners equal, and found that participants decided to stay longer with partners whom they expected to be 'better' than others, irrespective of actual performance. Importantly, both Study 1 and 2 included a nonsocial control condition that was probabilistically identical to the social conditions. All findings were replicated in nonsocial context, but results demonstrated that the effect of prior beliefs on stay/leave decision-making was much less pronounced in a social than a nonsocial context."
