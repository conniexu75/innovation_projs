https://openalex.org/W4286586919,"Using 44 sweeps of the US Census Household Pulse Survey data for the period April 2020 to April 22 we track the evolution of the mental health of just over three million Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic. We find anxiety, depression and worry had two major peaks in 2020 but improved in 2021 and 2022. We show that a variable we construct based on daily inflows of COVID cases by county, aggregated up to state, is positively associated with worse mental health, having conditioned on state fixed effects and seasonality in mental health. However, the size of the effect declines in 2021 and 2022 as vaccination rates rise. For women and college educated men having a vaccine improved mental health. However, being vaccinated worsens mental health among less educated men."
https://openalex.org/W4286587846,"Motor Imagery Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCIs) are AI-driven systems that capture brain activity patterns associated with mental imagination of movement and convert them into commands for external devices. Traditionally, MI-BCIs operate on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, which require extensive signal processing and feature engineering to extract changes in sensorimotor rhythms (SMR). In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) models have gained popularity for EEG classification as they provide a solution for automatic extraction of spatio-temporal features in the signals. However, past BCI studies that employed DL models, only attempted them with a small group of participants, without investigating the effectiveness of this approach for different user groups such as inefficient users. BCI inefficiency is a known and unsolved problem within BCI literature, generally defined as the inability of the user to produce the desired SMR patterns for the BCI classifier. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of DL models in capturing MI features particularly in the inefficient users. EEG signals from 54 subjects who performed a MI task of left- or right-hand grasp were recorded to compare the performance of two classification approaches; a ML approach vs. a DL approach. In the ML approach, Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) was used for feature extraction and then Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model was employed for binary classification of the MI task. In the DL approach, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was constructed on the raw EEG signals. Additionally, subjects were divided into high vs. low performers based on their online BCI accuracy and the difference between the two classifiersâ€™ performance was compared between groups. Our results showed that the CNN model improved the classification accuracy for all subjects within the range of 2.37 to 28.28%, but more importantly, this improvement was significantly larger for low performers. Our findings show promise for employment of DL models on raw EEG signals in future MI-BCI systems, particularly for BCI inefficient users who are unable to produce desired sensorimotor patterns for conventional ML approaches."
https://openalex.org/W4286508845,"Here, we report inducible mosaic animal for perturbation (iMAP), a transgenic platform enabling in situ CRISPR targeting of at least 100 genes in parallel throughout the mouse body. iMAP combines Cre-loxP and CRISPR-Cas9 technologies and utilizes a germline-transmitted transgene carrying a large array of individually floxed, tandemly linked gRNA-coding units. Cre-mediated recombination triggers expression of all the gRNAs in the array but only one of them per cell, converting the mice to mosaic organisms suitable for phenotypic characterization and also for high-throughput derivation of conventional single-gene perturbation lines via breeding. Using gRNA representation as a readout, we mapped a miniature Perturb-Atlas cataloging the perturbations of 90 genes across 39 tissues, which yields rich insights into context-dependent gene functions and provides a glimpse of the potential of iMAP in genome decoding."
https://openalex.org/W4286513803,"A key aspect of neuroscience research is the development of powerful, general-purpose data analyses that process large datasets. Unfortunately, modern data analyses have a hidden dependence upon complex computing infrastructure (e.g., software and hardware), which acts as an unaddressed deterrent to analysis users. Although existing analyses are increasingly shared as open-source software, the infrastructure and knowledge needed to deploy these analyses efficiently still pose significant barriers to use. In this work, we develop Neuroscience Cloud Analysis As a Service (NeuroCAAS): a fully automated open-source analysis platform offering automatic infrastructure reproducibility for any data analysis. We show how NeuroCAAS supports the design of simpler, more powerful data analyses and that many popular data analysis tools offered through NeuroCAAS outperform counterparts on typical infrastructure. Pairing rigorous infrastructure management with cloud resources, NeuroCAAS dramatically accelerates the dissemination and use of new data analyses for neuroscientific discovery."
https://openalex.org/W4286251963,"In the mammalian retina, a metabolic ecosystem exists in which photoreceptors acquire glucose from the choriocapillaris with the help of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). While the photoreceptor cells are primarily glycolytic, exhibiting Warburg-like metabolism, the RPE is reliant on mitochondrial respiration. However, the ways in which mitochondrial metabolism affect RPE cellular functions are not clear. We first used the human RPE cell line, ARPE-19, to examine mitochondrial metabolism in the context of cellular differentiation. We show that nicotinamide induced rapid differentiation of ARPE-19 cells, which was reversed by removal of supplemental nicotinamide. During the nicotinamide-induced differentiation, we observed using quantitative PCR, Western blotting, electron microscopy, and metabolic respiration and tracing assays that (1) mitochondrial gene and protein expression increased, (2) mitochondria became larger with more tightly folded cristae, and (3) mitochondrial metabolism was enhanced. In addition, we show that primary cultures of human fetal RPE cells responded similarly in the presence of nicotinamide. Furthermore, disruption of mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate attenuated the nicotinamide-induced differentiation of the RPE cells. Together, our results demonstrate a remarkable effect of nicotinamide on RPE metabolism. We also identify mitochondrial respiration as a key contributor to the differentiated state of the RPE and thus to many of the RPE functions that are essential for retinal health and photoreception."

https://openalex.org/W4286560383,"Abstract Wide metastasis contributes to a high death rate in ovarian cancer, and understanding of the molecular mechanism helps to find effective targets for metastatic ovarian cancer therapy. It has been found that phospholipase A2-activating protein (PLAA) is inactivated in some cancers, but its role in cancer metastasis remains unknown. Here, we found that PLAA was significantly downregulated in ovarian cancer highly metastatic cell lines and patients, and the low expression of PLAA was associated with poorer prognosis and high-risk clinicopathological features of patients. PLAA inhibited the migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells and metastasis of transplanted tumor in the orthotopic xenograft mouse model. Meanwhile, PLAA inhibited metastasis of ovarian cancer by inhibiting transient receptor potential channel canonical 3 (TRPC3)-mediated the intracellular Ca 2+ level. Mechanistically, PLAA inhibited methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) expression through the ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and METTL3 stabilized TRPC3 mRNA expression via N6-methyladenosine (m 6 A) modification. Our study verified the function and mechanism of the PLAA-METTL3-TRPC3 axis involved in ovarian cancer metastasis, with a view to providing a potential therapeutic approach for ovarian cancer."

https://openalex.org/W4286512142,"The Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) mediates long-term potentiation or depression (LTP or LTD) after distinct stimuli of hippocampal NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs). NMDAR-dependent LTD prevails in juvenile mice, but a mechanistically different form of LTD can be readily induced in adults by instead stimulating metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). However, the role that CaMKII plays in the mGluR-dependent form of LTD is not clear. Here we show that mGluR-dependent LTD also requires CaMKII and its T286 autophosphorylation (pT286), which induces Ca2+-independent autonomous kinase activity. In addition, we compared the role of pT286 among three forms of long-term plasticity (NMDAR-dependent LTP and LTD, and mGluR-dependent LTD) using simultaneous live imaging of endogenous CaMKII together with synaptic marker proteins. We determined that after LTP stimuli, pT286 autophosphorylation accelerated CaMKII movement to excitatory synapses. After NMDAR-LTD stimuli, pT286 was strictly required for any movement to inhibitory synapses. Similar to NMDAR-LTD, we found the mGluR-LTD stimuli did not induce CaMKII movement to excitatory synapses. However, in contrast to NMDAR-LTD, we demonstrate that the mGluR-LTD did not involve CaMKII movement to inhibitory synapses and did not require additional T305/306 autophosphorylation. Thus, despite its prominent role in LTP, we conclude that CaMKII T286 autophosphorylation is also required for both major forms of hippocampal LTD, albeit with differential requirements for the heterosynaptic communication of excitatory signals to inhibitory synapses.

Coultrap S.J. Bayer K.U. CaMKII holoenzyme mechanisms that govern the LTP versus LTD decision.Sci.

NMDAR-dependent LTD is still detectable in adult hippocampus but is much more prevalent at juvenile stages (13Dudek S.M. Bear M.F.

A role of CaMKII also in this mGluR-dependent LTD has been suggested by at least three independent pharmacological studies (17Schnabel R. Palmer M.J. Kilpatrick I.C. Collingridge G.L.

However, these pharmacological studies differed in the direction of the reported effect. Thus, it remained unclear if CaMKII promotes or inhibits mGluR-dependent LTD.Here, we tested CaMKII functions in mGluR-LTD using genetic approaches. Our results show that, like NMDAR-dependent LTP and LTD, the mGluR-LTD requires the CaMKIIÎ± isoform and its autophosphorylation at T286. Thus, we additionally compared the role of T286 phosphorylation in the CaMKII targeting to excitatory versus inhibitory synapses in response to these three plasticity stimuli. In NMDAR-LTD, the function of T286 phosphorylation is to enable induction of additional T305/306 phosphorylation, which is known to be required for the CaMKII movement to inhibitory synapses and for normal NMDAR-LTD (11Cook S.G. Buonarati O.R. Coultrap S.J. Bayer K.U. CaMKII holoenzyme mechanisms that govern the LTP versus LTD decision.Sci. Adv. 2021; 7eabe2300Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). By contrast, mGluR-LTD did not require this additional inhibitory autophosphorylation. Thus, even though CaMKII T286 autophosphorylation has a longstanding prominent role in LTP, it is also required for both major forms of LTD in hippocampal neurons, albeit with differential requirements for the heterosynaptic communication of excitatory signals to inhibitory synapses.ResultsmGluR-LTD requires the CaMKIIÎ± isoformAs pharmacological studies yielded conflicting results about the role of CaMKII in mGluR-LTD, we decided to test CaMKII functions in this form of plasticity by genetic means. Here, group I mGluRs (i.e., mGluR1 and mGluR5) were directly stimulated with (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) (100 Î¼M for 10 min). This treatment resulted in significant LTD at the CA3 to CA1 synapse in hippocampal slices from wildtype mice (Fig. 1A). Genetic knockout of the CaMKIIÎ± isoform completely abolished this mGluR-LTD (Fig. 1B). Thus, like LTP and NMDAR-LTD (6Coultrap S.J. Freund R.K. O'Leary H. Sanderson J.L. Roche K.W.

Deficient hippocampal long-term potentiation in a-calcium-calmodulin kinase II mutant mice.Science. 1992; 257: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar), normal mGluR-LTD specifically required the CaMKIIÎ± isoform. Therefore, all additional CaMKII point mutations tested here were specifically in the Î±-isoform. Notably, the CaMKIIÎ± isoform is exclusively expressed in neurons and is the major CaMKII isoform in mammalian brain, with âˆ¼4-fold higher hippocampal expression than the next most prevalent isoform, CaMKIIÎ² (21Cook S.G.

If any, the mGluR-LTD in the T305/306AV mice appeared to be slightly enhanced compared with the wildtype; however, this apparent enhancement was not statistically significant (Fig. 1E).

Overall, CaMKIIÎ± and its T286 autophosphorylation is required for normal LTP, for NMDAR-LTD, and for mGluR-LTD. By contrast, additional T305/306 autophosphorylation is required only for normal NMDAR-LTD but not for LTP or mGluR-LTD.T286 autophosphorylation accelerates movement of endogenous CaMKII to excitatory synapses after LTP stimuliAs T286 autophosphorylation is required for three distinct forms of long-term synaptic plasticity, we decided to determine how it affects CaMKII movement in hippocampal neurons in response to the different plasticity stimuli. It is known that T286 autophosphorylation is not strictly required for CaMKII movement to excitatory synapses in response to chemical LTP (cLTP) stimuli (29Shen K. Meyer T. Dynamic control of CaMKII translocation and localization in hippocampal neurons by NMDA receptor stimulation.Science. 1999; 284: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) or for Ca2+/CaM-induced binding to GluN2B in vitro (7Bayer K.U.

Indeed, the CaMKII movement induced by cLTP stimuli (1 min 100 Î¼M glutamate in the presence of 10 Î¼M glycine) was indistinguishable between overexpressed GFP-CaMKII wildtype and its T286A mutant (Fig. 2). However, when we instead monitored the movement of endogenous CaMKII with our intrabody method (11Cook S.G. Buonarati O.R. Coultrap S.J. Bayer K.U.

Thus, even though T286 autophosphorylation is not essential for the CaMKII movement to excitatory synapses that is required for normal LTP (8Barria A. Malinow R.

Similar as described in wildtype neurons, endogenous CaMKII in hippocampal neurons from T286A mutant mice moved to excitatory but not inhibitory synapses in response to cLTP stimulation. However, the endogenous T286A mutant moved more slowly to excitatory synapses, as significant synaptic enrichment was seen only at 2 min but not at 1 min after cLTP stimuli. These results indicate T286 autophosphorylation accelerates LTP-induced CaMKII synaptic targeting (one-way ANOVA, Tukeyâ€™s post hoc test versus pre, âˆ—âˆ—p = 0.0054, n = 13 neurons).

Buonarati O.R. Coultrap S.J. Bayer K.U. CaMKII holoenzyme mechanisms that govern the LTP versus LTD decision.Sci. Adv. 2021; 7eabe2300Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). An additional corequirement of T286 phosphorylation should be expected, because it is required for efficient T305/306 phosphorylation (11Cook S.G. Buonarati O.R. Coultrap S.J. Bayer K.U. CaMKII holoenzyme mechanisms that govern the LTP versus LTD decision.Sci. Adv. 2021; 7eabe2300Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Indeed, such requirement for T286 phosphorylation has been suggested by experiments with overexpressed GFP-CaMKII (31Marsden K.C. Shemesh A. Bayer K.U. Carroll R.C. Selective translocation of Ca2+/calmodulin protein kinase IIalpha (CaMKIIalpha) to inhibitory synapses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nonetheless, due to the discrepancies between movement of overexpressed and endogenous CaMKII in response to cLTP stimuli (see Figs. 2 and 3), we decided to examine the effect of T286A mutation also on endogenous CaMKII. As predicted, the T286A mutation completely abolished CaMKII movement to inhibitory synapses in response to NMDAR-dependent cLTD stimuli (Fig. 4). Thus, T286 autophosphorylation affects CaMKII movement to excitatory synapses in its temporal aspects, whereas it is absolutely required for any CaMKII movement to inhibitory synapses.Figure 4CaMKII movement to inhibitory synapses in response to NMDAR-LTD stimuli requires T286 autophosphorylation.

In response to cLTD, endogenous T286A mutant CaMKII did not move to either excitatory or inhibitory synapses (in contrast to CaMKII wildtype, which has been described to move to inhibitory but not excitatory synapses in response to LTD). C, minimal movement of the T286A mutant to excitatory synapses (red) and lack of movement to inhibitory synapses (blue) following cLTD is further illustrated in a full time course up to 10 min after stimulation. For comparison, the previously described movement of wildtype CaMKII is illustrated in gray (11Cook S.G. Buonarati O.R. Coultrap S.J. Bayer K.U.

However, and in contrast to the CaMKII wildtype, a mild but significant movement was observed at 10 min after the cLTD stimulus (Fig. 4C; p < 0.01 in t test), consistent with T286A alleviating not only the subsequent T305/306 phosphorylation step that suppressed the movement but also the directly accelerating effect of the T286 phosphorylation (see Fig. 3).mGluR-LTD stimuli do not induce synaptic CaMKII movementAs NMDAR-dependent cLTP or cLTD stimuli induce CaMKII movement to either excitatory or inhibitory synapses, respectively, we decided to examine if mGluR-LTD stimuli with 100 Î¼M DHPG for 10 min also cause CaMKII movement. Endogenous CaMKII was monitored for 20 min after the DHPG stimulus in cultured hippocampal neurons, but no movement to either excitatory or inhibitory synapses was detected (Fig. 5A, B). After NMDAR-dependent cLTP stimuli, lack of CaMKII movement to excitatory synapses is mediated by active suppression mechanisms (11Cook S.G. Buonarati O.R. Coultrap S.J. Bayer K.U.

DAPK1 mediates LTD by making CaMKII/GluN2B binding LTP specific.Cell Rep. 2017; 19: 2231-2243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the CaMKII T305/306AV mutation is sufficient to restore movement to excitatory synapses even after such cLTD stimuli (11Cook S.G. Buonarati O.R. Coultrap S.J. Bayer K.U. CaMKII holoenzyme mechanisms that govern the LTP versus LTD decision.Sci. Adv. 2021; 7eabe2300Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, we also tested neurons from T305/306AV mutant mice for DHPG-induced CaMKII movement, but again, no movement was detected (Fig. 5C). This indicates either that the mechanisms for suppression of CaMKII movement differ in NMDAR- versus mGluR-LTD or that mGluR-LTD may not require such a suppression mechanism at all. Either scenario is consistent with the normal mGluR-LTD observed in hippocampal slices from the CaMKII T305/T306AV mutant mice (see Fig. 1, D and E).Figure 5mGluR stimulation does not promote CaMKII movement to synapses.

Variation in driver mutation frequency between patients with the same tumor type as well as within an individual patients' cancer can shape the use of mutations as diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. We have characterized genomic heterogeneity between and within canine splenic hemangiosarcoma (HSA), a common naturally occurring cancer in pet dogs that is similar to human angiosarcoma (AS). HSA is a clinically, physiologically, and genomically complex canine cancer that may serve as a valuable model for understanding the origin and clinical impact of cancer heterogeneity. We conducted a prospective collection of 52 splenic masses from 43 dogs (27 HSA, 15 benign masses, and 1 stromal sarcoma) presenting for emergency care with hemoperitoneum secondary to a ruptured splenic mass. Multi-platform genomic analysis included matched tumor/normal targeted sequencing panel and exome sequencing. We found candidate somatic cancer driver mutations in 14/27 (52%) HSAs. Among recurrent candidate driver mutations, TP53 was most commonly mutated (30%) followed by PIK3CA (15%), AKT1 (11%), and CDKN2AIP (11%). We also identified significant intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, consistent with a branched evolution model, through multi-region exome sequencing of three distinct tumor regions from selected primary splenic tumors. These data provide new perspectives on the genomic landscape of this veterinary cancer and suggest a cross-species value for using HSA in pet dogs as a naturally occurring model of intratumoral heterogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W4286252630,"Protein arginine methylation is involved in many biological processes and can be enhanced in cancer. In mammals, these reactions are catalyzed on multiple substrates by a family of nine protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs). However, conditions that may regulate the activity of each enzyme and that may help us understand the physiological role of PRMTs have not been fully established. Previous studies had suggested unexpected effects of temperature and ionic strength on PRMT7 activity. Here we examine in detail the effects of temperature, pH, and ionic strength on recombinant human PRMT1, PRMT5, and PRMT7. We confirmed the unusual temperature dependence of PRMT7, where optimal activity was observed at 15 Â°C. On the other hand, we found that PRMT1 and PRMT5 are most active near physiological temperatures of 37 Â°C. However, we showed all three enzymes still have significant activity at 0 Â°C. Furthermore, we determined that PRMT1 is most active at a pH of about 7.7, while PRMT5 activity is not dependent on pH in the range of 6.5 to 8.5. Significantly, PRMT7 is most active at an alkaline pH of 8.5 but shows little activity at the physiological intracellular pH of about 7.2. We also detected decreased activity at physiological salt conditions for PRMT1, PRMT5, and PRMT7. We demonstrate that the loss of activity is due to the increasing ionic strength. Taken together, these results open the possibility that PRMTs respond in cells undergoing temperature, salt, or pH stress and demonstrate the potential for in vivo regulation of protein arginine methylation."

https://openalex.org/W4286512158,"Insulin signaling in blood vessels primarily functions to stimulate angiogenesis and maintain vascular homeostasis through the canonical PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways. However, angiogenesis is a complex process coordinated by multiple other signaling events. Here, we report a distinct crosstalk between the insulin receptor and endoglin/activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), an endothelial cell-specific TGF-Î² receptor complex essential for angiogenesis. While the endoglin-ALK1 complex normally binds to TGF-Î² or bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9) to promote gene regulation via transcription factors Smad1/5, we show that insulin drives insulin receptor oligomerization with endoglin-ALK1 at the cell surface to trigger rapid Smad1/5 activation. Through quantitative proteomic analysis, we identify ependymin-related protein 1 (EPDR1) as a major Smad1/5 gene target induced by insulin but not by TGF-Î² or BMP9. We found endothelial EPDR1 expression is minimal at the basal state but is markedly enhanced upon prolonged insulin treatment to promote cell migration and formation of capillary tubules. Conversely, we demonstrate EPDR1 depletion strongly abrogates these angiogenic effects, indicating that EPDR1 is a crucial mediator of insulin-induced angiogenesis. Taken together, these results suggest important therapeutic implications for EPDR1 and the TGF-Î² pathways in pathologic angiogenesis during hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W4286249741,"The protein product of the CDKN1A gene, p21, has been extensively characterized as a negative regulator of the cell cycle. Nevertheless, it is clear that p21 has manifold complex and context-dependent roles that can be either tumor suppressive or oncogenic. Most well studied as a transcriptional target of the p53 tumor suppressor protein, there are other means by which p21 levels can be regulated. In this study, we show that pharmacological inhibition or siRNA-mediated reduction of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), the enzyme responsible for glycosylation of intracellular proteins, increases expression of p21 in both p53-dependent and p53-independent manners in nontransformed and cancer cells. In cells harboring WT p53, we demonstrate that inhibition of OGT leads to p53-mediated transactivation of CDKN1A, while in cells that do not express p53, inhibiting OGT leads to increased p21 protein stabilization. p21 is normally degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system following ubiquitination by, among others, the E3 ligase Skp-Cullin-F-box complex; however, in this case, we show that blocking OGT causes impairment of the Skp-Cullin-F-box ubiquitin complex as a result of disruption of the FoxM1 transcription factor-mediated induction of Skp2 expression. In either setting, we conclude that p21 levels induced by OGT inhibition correlate with cell cycle arrest and decreased cancer cell proliferation."

Previously, the identity of the cardiac-MLCP was biochemically shown to be similar to the smooth muscle MLCP, which is a well-characterized trimeric protein comprising the regulatory subunit (MYPT1), catalytic subunit PP1cÎ², and accessory subunit M20. In smooth muscles in vivo, MYPT1 and PP1cÎ² co-stabilize each other and are both necessary for normal smooth muscle contractions. In the cardiac muscle, MYPT1 and MYPT2 are both expressed, but contributions to physiological regulation of cardiac myosin dephosphorylation are unclear. We hypothesized that the main catalytic subunit for cardiac-MLCP is PP1cÎ², and maintenance of RLC phosphorylation in vivo is dependent on regulation by striated muscle-specific MYPT2. Here, we used PP1cÎ² conditional knockout mice to biochemically define cardiac-MLCP proteins and developed a cardiac myofibrillar phosphatase assay to measure the direct contribution of MYPT-regulated and MYPT-independent phosphatase activities toward phosphorylated cardiac myosin. We report that (1) PP1cÎ² is the main isoform expressed in the cardiac myocyte, (2) cardiac muscle pathogenesis in PP1cÎ² knockout animals involve upregulation of total PP1cÎ± in myocytes and non-muscle cells, (3) the stability of cardiac MYPT1 and MYPT2 proteins in vivo is not dependent on the PP1cÎ² expression, and (4) phosphorylated myofibrillar cardiac myosin is dephosphorylated by both myosin-targeted and soluble MYPT-independent PP1cÎ² activities. These results contribute to our understanding of the cardiac-MLCP in vivo."

Under very general condition, numbers are expected to naturally conform to the theorized digits pattern. On the other side, any deviation from the Benford distribution could identify an exogenous modification of the expected pattern, due to data manipulation or even fraud. Many statistical tests are available for assessing the Benford conformity of a sample. However, in some practical applications, the limited number of data to analyze may raise questions concerning their reliability. The first aim of this article is then to analyze and compare the behavior of Benford conformity testing procedures applied to very small samples through an extensive Monte Carlo experiment. Simulations will consider a thorough choice of compliance tests and a very heterogeneous selection of alternative distributions. Secondly, we will use the simulation results for defining a new testing procedure, based on the combination of three tests, that guarantees suitable levels of power in each alternative scenario. Finally, a practical application is provided, demonstrating how a sounding testing Benford compliance test for very small samples is important and profitable in anti-fraud investigations."
https://openalex.org/W4286587290,"Inflammation is caused by a cascade of events, one of which is the metabolism of arachidonic acid, that begins with oxidation by the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase. 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LOX) plays an important role in the inflammation process by synthesizing leukotrienes and several lipid mediators and has emerged as a possible therapeutic target for treatment of inflammatory diseases such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. Most of the existing 5-LOX inhibitors are synthetic and exhibit adverse side effects. In view of this, there is need to search for an alternate source of 5-LOX inhibitor with minimal side effects. The essential oil of several species of Curcuma has received considerable attention in recent times in traditional system of medicine especially for treating various inflammatory disorders. Therefore, the present study was carried out to screen the most potential 5-LOX inhibitors from essential oil components of Curcuma species and elucidate their mechanisms of action through computational biology approaches. Twenty-three phytoconstituents derived from the essential oil of Curcuma species were docked and their predictive binding energies were calculated to select the best possible ligand for 5-LOX. The top 8 ranked compounds from docking was tested for drug-likeness properties, bioactivity score, and toxicity analysis. The phytoconstituents such as Î±-turmerone, Î²-turmerone, Î±-terpineol and dihydrocarveolshowed the best binding affinity with 5-LOX and displayed favorable physicochemical properties. Molecular dynamics simulation in POPC lipid bilayers was carried out to understand the intrinsic dynamics and flexibility of the 5-LOX (apo) and 5-LOX-complex (Î±-terpineol, Î±-turmerone, Î²-turmerone and dihydrocarveol) systems. The molecular dynamic results showed that these 4 phytoconstituents interacted stably with the 5-LOX active site residues and the important bonds that were observed in the initial ligand docked compounds did not alter during the course of simulation. In general, our integrative computational approach demonstrated that the natural compounds like Î±-turmerone, Î²-turmerone, Î±-terpineol, and dihydrocarveol could be considered for designing specific anti-inflammatory drugs using structure-based drug design."

To test this hypothesis, mouse epigenetic clock (epiclock) was profiled in fetal (gestation day 15), postnatal (day 5), and aging (week 70) brain of male and female C57BL/6J inbred mice. Data analysis showed that on week 70, the female brain was epigenetically younger than the male brain. Predictive modeling by neural network identified specific methylations in the brain at the developing stages that were predictive of epigenetic state of the brain during aging. Transcriptomic analysis showed coordinated changes in the expression of epiclock genes in the fetal brain relative to the placenta. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing identified sites that were methylated both in the placenta and fetal brain in a sex-specific manner. Epiclock genes and genes associated with specific signaling pathways, primarily the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR) pathway, were associated with the sex-bias methylations in the placenta as well as the fetal brain. Transcriptional crosstalk among the epiclock and GnRHR pathway genes was evident in the placenta that was maintained in the brain during development as well as aging. Collectively, these findings suggest that sex differences in the aging of the brain are of fetal origin and epigenetically linked to the placenta."

As a part of a qualitative study in Belu, this paper describes the use of traditional medicines for HIV treatment and family and social influence as barriers to access to HIV care services among PLHIV. One-on-one in-depth interviews were employed to collect data from 46 PLHIV (26 women and 20 men) and 10 healthcare professionals. They were recruited using the snowball sampling technique. The study information sheets were initially posted on information boards in healthcare facilities. Potential participants who contacted to confirm their participation were recruited for an interview and then asked for help to distribute the information sheets to their eligible colleagues who might be willing to participate. Data analysis was performed using NVivo 12 software and guided by a qualitative data analysis framework. The findings showed that the use of traditional medicines, a well-known cultural practice in Belu, was a barrier to access to HIV care services among PLHIV. The influence of family in determining the use of traditional medicines for HIV treatment, supported by the lack of knowledge of ART, effectiveness of traditional medicines in treating other health issues, and social influence of relatives, neighbours, and friends, were also significant barriers to PLHIV's access to HIV care services. The findings indicate the need for dissemination of HIV care-related information for PLHIV, family, and community members to increase their knowledge of the service, ART and its function, and to support and improve access to HIV care services especially ART by PLHIV."
https://openalex.org/W4286251280,"[NiFe]-hydrogenases (Hyds) comprise a small and a large subunit. The latter harbors the biologically unique [NiFe](CN)2CO active-site cofactor. The maturation process includes the assembly of the [Fe](CN)2CO cofactor precursor, nickel binding, endoproteolytic cleavage of the large subunit, and dimerization with the small subunit to yield active enzyme. The biosynthesis of the [Fe](CN)2CO moiety of [NiFe]-Hyd-1 and Hyd-2 occurs on the scaffold complex HybG-HypD (GD), whereas the HypC-HypD complex is specific for the assembly of Hyd-3. The metabolic source and the route for delivering iron to the active site remain unclear. To investigate the maturation process of O2-tolerant Hyd-1 from Escherichia coli, we developed an enzymatic in vitro reconstitution system that allows for the synthesis of Hyd-1 using only purified components. Together with this in vitro reconstitution system, we employed biochemical analyses, infrared spectroscopy (attenuated total reflection FTIR), mass spectrometry (MS), and microscale thermophoresis to monitor the iron transfer during the maturation process and to understand how the [Fe](CN)2CO cofactor precursor is ultimately incorporated into the large subunit. We demonstrate the direct transfer of iron from 57Fe-labeled GD complex to the large subunit of Hyd-1. Our data reveal that the GD complex exclusively interacts with the large subunit of Hyd-1 and Hyd-2 but not with the large subunit of Hyd-3. Furthermore, we show that the presence of iron in the active site is a prerequisite for nickel insertion. Taken together, these findings reveal how the [Fe](CN)2CO cofactor precursor is transferred and incorporated into the active site of [NiFe]-Hyd."

PKG1 is the major effector of beneficial cGMP signaling which is involved in smooth muscle relaxation and vascular tone, inhibition of platelet aggregation and signaling that leads to cardioprotection. In this study, a novel piperidine series of activators previously identified from an ultrahigh-throughput screen were validated to directly bind partially activated PKG1Î± and subsequently enhance its kinase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Compounds from initial optimization efforts showed an ability to activate PKG1Î± independent of the endogenous activator, cGMP. We demonstrate these small molecule activators mimic the effect of cGMP on the kinetic parameters of PKG1Î± by positively modulating the KM of the peptide substrate and negatively modulating the apparent KM for ATP with increase in catalytic efficiency, kcat. In addition, these compounds also allosterically modulate the binding affinity of cGMP for PKG1Î± by increasing the affinity of cGMP for the high-affinity binding site (CNB-A) and decreasing the affinity of cGMP for the low-affinity binding site (CNB-B). We show the mode of action of these activators involves binding to an allosteric site within the regulatory domain, near the CNB-B binding site. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first reported non-cGMP mimetic small molecules shown to directly activate PKG1Î±. Insights into the mechanism of action of these compounds will enable future development of cardioprotective compounds that function through novel modes of action for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases."

The results were validated in an independent Northern American cohort of 85 HGSOC patients with publicly available NGS RNA-seq data. Detailed statistical analyses of our cohort with multivariate Cox and logistic regression models considering clinico-pathological data and different TP53 mutation statuses, revealed an altered expression of 49 genes to affect the prognosis and/or treatment response. Next, these genes were investigated in the validation cohort, to confirm the clinical significance of their expression alterations, and to identify genetic variants with an expected high or moderate impact on their products. The expression changes of five genes, PROM1, CXCL8, RUNX1, NAV1, TP73, were found to predict prognosis or response to treatment in both cohorts, depending on the TP53 mutation status.

The emission control obtained by installing these PCDs is explained in this article based on the data gathered from the survey. The cartridge filter equipped with an induction furnace reduced the concentration of SPM to less than 20 mg/Nm 3 . This result of the investigation indicates that the cartridge filter built into the induction furnace achieves the best efficiency in controlling contaminants from iron foundries. Interestingly, the operation of the cartridge filter has yet to be documented. Therefore, the construction operation, the performance of the cartridge filter, and its efficiency in achieving contaminations control in foundries are described. This will provide useful information on the use of cartridge filters in an induction furnace to reduce Iron foundry emissions."
https://openalex.org/W4287577966,"Tuberculosis (TB), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) share a global presence and propensity to disproportionately affect marginalized populations. However, over recent decades, many fewer drugs have been brought to market for TB than for the others. Although three new anti-TB drugs have been approved in the US or Europe in the last 10 years, uptake of these drugs has been limited. Using case examples of drugs developed recently for TB, HIV, and HCV, we explore possible reasons. We examine the use and effect of regulatory pathways intended to address weak economic incentives in the face of urgent, unmet needs; evaluate the extent of data underpinning authorizations for these indications; document development timelines and evidence available at the time of each approval; consider explanations for observed differences; and discuss the implications for clinical guidelines and use.For each indication, we selected two drugs: one recently approved and one approved between 2012 and 2014, when the first new anti-TB drug from a novel class in more than 40 years received marketing authorization. We calculated time from first published peer-reviewed evidence of activity to date of approval; the number of phase 1, 2, and 3 trials; the number of trial participants randomized to treatment arms containing the drug; and the total number of participants in each trial from the individual drug approval packages. We found that the two TB drugs took longer to gain approval (8.0 and 19.2 years for bedaquiline and pretomanid, respectively) despite availing of special regulatory pathways meant to expedite approval, when compared to the HIV (2.6 years for dolutegravir and 4.7 years for doravirine) and HCV drugs (3.2 and 1.6 years for sofosbuvir and glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, respectively). Moreover, fewer participants were studied prior to TB drug approvals (380 and 879) than prior to approvals for HIV (1598 and 979) and for HCV (2291 and 2448) drugs.The dramatic disparities observed in TB drug development reaffirm the importance of several actions. Increased investment in TB research and development is necessary to rapidly advance drugs through the pipeline. Development plans and partnerships must provide safety and efficacy evidence on combinations and durations that are relevant to real-world use in heterogeneous populations. Reliable, validated surrogate markers of relapse-free cure are essential to decrease the duration and cost of TB treatment trials and increase the confidence and speed with which new regimens can advance. Lastly, regulators and normative bodies must maintain high evidentiary standards for authorization while ensuring timely and broad approval for TB drugs and regimens."
https://openalex.org/W4286252603,"The tumor suppressor p53 is involved in the adaptation of hepatic metabolism to nutrient availability. Acute deletion of p53 in the mouse liver affects hepatic glucose and triglyceride metabolism. However, long-term adaptations upon the loss of hepatic p53 and its transcriptional regulators are unknown. Here we show that short-term, but not chronic, liver-specific deletion of p53 in mice reduces liver glycogen levels, and we implicate the transcription factor forkhead box O1 protein (FOXO1) in the regulation of p53 and its target genes. We demonstrate that acute p53 deletion prevents glycogen accumulation upon refeeding, whereas a chronic loss of p53 associates with a compensational activation of the glycogen synthesis pathway. Moreover, we identify fasting-activated FOXO1 as a repressor of p53 transcription in hepatocytes. We show that this repression is relieved by inactivation of FOXO1 by insulin, which likely mediates the upregulation of p53 expression upon refeeding. Strikingly, we find that high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance with persistent FOXO1 activation not only blunted the regulation of p53 but also the induction of p53 target genes like p21 during fasting, indicating overlapping effects of both FOXO1 and p53 on target gene expression in a context-dependent manner. Thus, we conclude that p53 acutely controls glycogen storage in the liver and is linked to insulin signaling via FOXO1, which has important implications for our understanding of the hepatic adaptation to nutrient availability."
https://openalex.org/W4286266891,"Secretagogin (SCGN) is a three-domain hexa-EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein that plays a regulatory role in the release of several hormones. SCGN is expressed largely in pancreatic Î²-cells, certain parts of the brain, and also in neuroendocrine tissues. The expression of SCGN is altered in several diseases, such as diabetes, cancers, and neurodegenerative disorders; however, the precise associations that closely link SCGN expression to such pathophysiologies are not known. In this work, we report that SCGN is an early responder to cellular stress, and SCGN expression is temporally upregulated by oxidative stress and heat shock. We show the overexpression of SCGN efficiently prevents cells from heat shock and oxidative damage. We further demonstrate that in the presence of Ca2+, SCGN efficiently prevents the aggregation of a broad range of model proteins in vitro. Small-angle X-ray scattering (BioSAXS) studies further reveal that Ca2+ induces the conversion of a closed compact apo-SCGN conformation into an open extended holo-SCGN conformation via multistate intermediates, consistent with the augmentation of chaperone activity of SCGN. Furthermore, isothermal titration calorimetry establishes that Ca2+ enables SCGN to bind Î±-synuclein and insulin, two target proteins of SCGN. Altogether, our data not only demonstrate that SCGN is a Ca2+-dependent generic molecular chaperone involved in protein homeostasis with broad substrate specificity but also elucidate the origin of its altered expression in several cancers. We describe a plausible mechanism of how perturbations in Ca2+ homeostasis and/or deregulated SCGN expression would hasten the process of protein misfolding, which is a feature of many aggregation-based proteinopathies."

https://openalex.org/W4286268417,"Promiscuous G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) engage multiple GÎ± subtypes with different efficacies to propagate signals in cells. A mechanistic understanding of GÎ± selectivity by GPCRs is critical for therapeutic design, since signaling can be restrained by ligand-receptor complexes to preferentially engage specific G proteins. However, details of GPCR selectivity are unresolved. Here, we investigated cognate G protein selectivity using the prototypical promiscuous GÎ±q/11 and GÎ±12/13 coupling receptors, angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) and prostaglandin F2Î± receptor (FP), bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based G protein and pathway-selective sensors, and G protein knockout cells. We determined that competition between G proteins for receptor binding occurred in a receptor- and G protein-specific manner for AT1R and FP but not for other receptors tested. In addition, we show that while GÎ±12/13 competes with GÎ±q/11 for AT1R coupling, the opposite occurs for FP, and GÎ±q-mediated signaling regulated G protein coupling only at AT1R. In cells, the functional modulation of biased ligands at FP and AT1R was contingent upon cognate GÎ± availability. The efficacy of AT1R-biased ligands, which poorly signal through GÎ±q/11, increased in the absence of GÎ±12/13. Finally, we show that a positive allosteric modulator of GÎ±q/11 signaling that also allosterically decreases FP-GÎ±12/13 coupling, lost its negative modulation in the absence of GÎ±q/11 coupling to FP. Together, our findings suggest that despite preferential binding of similar subsets of G proteins, GPCRs follow distinct selectivity rules, which may contribute to the regulation of ligand-mediated G protein bias of AT1R and FP."

https://openalex.org/W4286587352,"Background It is not clear how changes to healthcare delivery related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including virtual care and social distancing restrictions, have impacted the experience of living with cancer. This study aimed to discover a theory capable of describing the cancer experience, how the pandemic impacted it, and for guiding predictions about how to improve it. Methods Between October 2020 and July 2021 digitally recorded semi-structured one-on-one interviews were conducted virtually with adult cancer patients and informal caregivers in Manitoba, Canada. Transcriptions and field notes from the interviews were analyzed using classic grounded theory. Results Interviews with 33 patients and 6 informal caregivers were conducted. Fit emerged as the core concept of the theory and describes the relationship between the healthcare system and the unique combination of characteristics each patient has. Good fit results in a positive experience and poor fit in a negative experience. Virtual care improves fit in clinical situations where non-verbal communication and physical examination are not important. Support from informal caregivers improves fit. Social distancing restrictions reduce the ability of informal caregivers to provide support. Conclusions The impact of fit on the cancer experience suggests that care delivery should be tailored to both the individual needs of the patient and the intention of the clinical interaction. Developing evidence-based strategies to inform the integration of virtual care into oncology practice, with aim of promoting good fit between patients and healthcare services, is an important future direction."

The heparin treated blood (n = 10) and EDTA treated blood (n = 10) from Varanus salvator were obtained for PBMCs evaluation. The PBMCs obtained from the heparin treated blood was significantly higher than that of EDTA treated blood during the culture period (P < 0.05) indicated heparin would be more appropriated anticoagulant for blood collection. The PBMCs cultured under 37Â°C and 27Â°C were not significantly difference on first three days but 37Â°C showed significantly higher effect in the following days (P < 0.05) indicated both temperatures can be used which 37Â°C should be an optimal for PBMCs preparation.

https://openalex.org/W4286587560,"Extractive document summarization (EDS) is usually seen as a sequence labeling task, which extracts sentences from a document one by one to form a summary. However, extracting sentences separately ignores the relationship between the sentences and documents. One solution is to use sentence position information to enhance sentence representation, but this will cause the sentence-leading bias problem, especially in news datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel sentence centrality for the EDS task to address these two problems. The sentence centrality is based on directed graphs, while reflecting the sentence-document relationship, it also reflects the sentence position information in the document. We implicitly strengthen the relevance of sentences and documents by using sentence centrality to enhance sentence representation. Notably, we replaced the sentence position information with sentence centrality to reduce sentence-leading bias without causing model performance degradation. Experiments on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset showed that EDS models with sentence centrality significantly improved compared with baseline models."
https://openalex.org/W4286252364,"Katanin p60 ATPase-containing subunit A1 (KATNA1) is a microtubule-cleaving enzyme that regulates the development of neural protrusions through cytoskeletal rearrangements. However, the mechanism underlying the linkage of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protein to KATNA1 and how this modification regulates the development of neural protrusions is unclear. Here we discovered, using mass spectrometry analysis, that SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9, an enzyme necessary for the SUMOylation process, was present in the KATNA1 interactome. Moreover, GST-pull down and co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that KATNA1 and SUMO interact. We further demonstrated using immunofluorescence experiments that KATNA1 and the SUMO2 isoform colocalized in hippocampal neurites. We also performed a bioinformatics analysis of KATNA1 protein sequences to identify three potentially conserved SUMOylation sites (K77, K157, and K330) among vertebrates. Mutation of K330, but not K77 or K157, abolished KATNA1-induced microtubule severing and decreased the level of binding observed for KATNA1 and SUMO2. Cotransfection of SUMO2 and wildtype KATNA1 in COS7 cells increased microtubule severing, whereas no effect was observed after cotransfection with the K330R KATNA1 mutant. Furthermore, in cultured hippocampal neurons, overexpression of wildtype KATNA1 significantly promoted neurite outgrowth, whereas the K330R mutant eliminated this effect. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the K330 site in KATNA1 is modified by SUMOylation and SUMOylation of KATNA1 promotes microtubule dynamics and hippocampal neurite outgrowth."

In the present study, we investigated the effect of miR-124a loss on neuronal differentiation in mice and in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Since miR-124a-3 exhibits only background expression levels in the brain and we were unable to obtain miR-124a-1/2/3 triple knockout (TKO) mice by mating, we generated and analyzed miR-124a-1/2 double knockout (DKO) mice. We found that these DKO mice exhibit perinatal lethality. RNA-seq analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of proneural and neuronal marker genes were almost unchanged between the control and miR-124a-1/2 DKO brains; however, genes related to neuronal synaptic formation and function were enriched among downregulated genes in the miR-124a-1/2 DKO brain. In addition, we found the transcription regulator Tardbp/TDP-43, loss of which leads to defects in neuronal maturation and function, was inactivated in the miR-124a-1/2 DKO brain. Furthermore, Tardbp knockdown suppressed neurite extension in cultured neuronal cells. We also generated miR-124a-1/2/3 TKO ES cells using CRISPR-Cas9 as an alternative to TKO mice. Phase-contrast microscopic, immunocytochemical, and gene expression analyses showed that miR-124a-1/2/3 TKO ES cell lines were able to differentiate into neurons. Collectively, these results suggest that miR-124a plays a role in neuronal maturation rather than neurogenesis in vivo and advance our understanding of the functional roles of microRNAs in central nervous system development."

https://openalex.org/W4286511750,"The chromatin-associated high mobility group protein N2 (HMGN2) cofactor regulates transcription factor activity through both chromatin and protein interactions. Hmgn2 expression is known to be developmentally regulated, but the post-transcriptional mechanisms that regulate Hmgn2 expression and its precise roles in tooth development remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that HMGN2 inhibits the activity of multiple transcription factors as a general mechanism to regulate early development. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation, pull-down, and coimmunoprecipitation assays show that HMGN2 interacts with the transcription factor Lef-1 through its HMG-box domain as well as with other early development transcription factors, Dlx2, FoxJ1, and Pitx2. Furthermore, EMSAs demonstrate that HMGN2 binding to Lef-1 inhibits its DNA-binding activity. We found that Pitx2 and Hmgn2 associate with H4K5ac and H3K4me2 chromatin marks in the proximal Dlx2 promoter, demonstrating Hmgn2 association with open chromatin. In addition, we demonstrate that microRNAs (miRs) mir-23a and miR-23b directly target Hmgn2, promoting transcriptional activation at several gene promoters, including the amelogenin promoter. In vivo, we found that decreased Hmgn2 expression correlates with increased miR-23 expression in craniofacial tissues as the murine embryo develops. Finally, we show that ablation of Hmgn2 in mice results in increased amelogenin expression because of increased Pitx2, Dlx2, Lef-1, and FoxJ1 transcriptional activity. Taken together, our results demonstrate both post-transcriptional regulation of Hmgn2 by miR-23a/b and post-translational regulation of gene expression by Hmgn2â€“transcription factor interactions.

HMGN2 is a chromatin-associated factor able to inhibit transcription factor DNA binding and transcriptional activation. Furthermore, HMGN2 acts as a general regulator of multiple transcription factors and is directly targeted by miR-23a+b. Interestingly, as development progresses the expression of Hmgn2 in the mouse gradually decreases in a manner that was inversely correlated with miR-23a+b during tooth development and amelogenin expression, the gene required for enamel formation. Finally, deletion of Hmgn2 in mice resulted in increased amelogenin expression affecting tooth development. Our research defines HMGN2 as a general regulator of transcription factor activity through protein interactions associated with active chromatin marks. This report describes both post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms to regulate multiple genes by HMGN2.ResultsHMGN2 interacts with Lef-1 in the nucleus and represses Lef-1 transcriptional activityWe have used a cell model to demonstrate a direct interaction between Lef-1 and HMGN2 and their cellular localization by performing the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay. Lef-1 was ligated to the N terminus of an EYFP-N (EYFP [enhanced YFP]) coding sequence, and HMGN2 was cloned to the N-terminal region of an EYFP-C sequence (Fig. 1A). Direct physical association between Lef-1-YN and HMGN2-YC resulted in fluorescence under EYFP excitation wavelength because of interactions between N and C fragments of the EYFP protein (Fig. 1B) (37Hu C.-D.

As shown in Figure 1C, Lef-1-YN and HMGN2-YC interact to produce fluorescence that is confined to the nucleus. As controls, transfecting either Lef-1-YN with the FLAG-EYFP-C fragment (FLAG-YC) or HMGN2-YC with FLAG-EYFP-N fragment (FLAG-YN) did not emit fluorescence (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that Lef-1 and HMGN2 interact in the nucleus of living cells.We have demonstrated that HMGN2 interacts with Pitx2 and Sox2 to form an inactive complex to inhibit Pitx2 and Sox2 DNA-binding activity (23Amen M.

To determine if HMGN2 regulates Lef-1 activation of the Dlx2 promoter, we cotransfected the Dlx2 promoter luciferase reporter, Lef-1 and ÃŸ-catenin with/without HMGN2 in LS-8 oral epithelial cells. The luciferase results show that Lef-1 activated the Dlx2 promoter, but this activation was significantly reduced while overexpressing HMGN2 (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, cotransfection with Î²-cat rescued Lef-1 transcriptional inhibition by the HMGN2 protein. Therefore, HMGN2 inhibits Lef-1 transactivation of the Dlx2 promoter, and the Lef-1 interaction with Î²-cat overcomes this inhibition. Coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays also demonstrate a direct interaction of endogenous Hmgn2 with endogenous Lef-1 in LS-8 oral epithelial cells (Fig. 1E).HMGN2 interacts with the Lef-1 HMG-box domainTo map the Lef-1 domain that interacts with HMGN2, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down experiments were performed using purified bacteria-expressed proteins. A schematic diagram of the immobilized GST-Lef-1 full-length and truncated proteins is shown (Fig. 2A). Full-length HMGN2 protein was used in the pull-down experiments and immobilized GST-Lef-1, GST-Lef-1 Î”N113, GST-Lef-1Î”N295, and GST-Lef-1 Î”N113-Î”C34 all bound HMGN2 protein (Fig. 2B). However, GST-Lef-1 Î”N363 and GST-Lef-1 Î”N113-Î”C102 did not bind HMGN2 protein (Fig. 2B). From these experiments, we identified that HMGN2 interacts with the Lef-1 HMG-box domain (Fig. 2A).Figure 2HMGN2 interacts with the HMG-box domain in the Lef-1 protein. A, schematic of the Lef-1 protein and truncated proteins. The location of the HMGN2-binding domain in the Lef-1 protein is shown. B, GST-Lef-1 protein pull-down assay with bacterial-expressed and purified HMGN2 protein (100 ng). To demonstrate HMGN2 binding to Lef-1, Lef-1 protein was incubated with purified HMGN2 protein. HMGN2 binds to the Lef-1 HMG domain. C, coimmunoprecipitation (IP) experiments demonstrate a Lef-1â€“HMGN2â€“Î²-catenin (Î²-cat) complex in CHO cells. Lef-1, HMGN2, and/or Î²-cat (2.5 Î¼g) were transfected into CHO cells. Cell lysates were incubated with Î²-cat antibody (Ab), and the IP complex was isolated and resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and probed for HMGN2 using the HMGN2 Ab. The Î²-cat antibody immunoprecipitated the Lef-1â€“HMGN2â€“Î²-cat complex, denoted by the asterisk. HMGN2 was detected only in the Î²-catâ€“Lef-1â€“HMGN2 precipitated complex. HMGN2 does not bind to Î²-cat. As controls transfected Î²-cat input, cotransfected Î²-cat and HMGN2, cotransfected Î²-cat and Lef-1, and all three cotransfected protein inputs were probed for HMGN2 protein.

An immunoprecipitation (IP) assay was performed to detect HMGN2 binding to endogenous Î²-cat and transfected Lef-1 and HMGN2 in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Fig. 2C). Î²-cat was immunoprecipitated from CHO cells transfected with plasmids for HMGN2 and Lef-1, and immunoprecipitates were then probed for HMGN2 protein. HMGN2 bound only to the Î²-catâ€“Lef-1 complex and not to Î²-cat alone (Fig. 2C).HMGN2 inhibits Lef-1 DNA-binding activityHMGN2 inhibits Lef-1 transcriptional activity through direct interactions in the cell nucleus. However, the mechanism for this inhibition is not known. We asked if HMGN2 inhibited Lef-1 DNA-binding activity because of its interaction with the Lef-1 HMG-box domain. Interestingly, titration of purified HMGN2 after Lef-1 binding to a labeled Lef-1-binding sequence (Lef-1 probe) in an EMSA showed that HMGN2 acts to inhibit Lef-1 binding to its DNA-binding element (Fig. 3). HMGN2 binds nonspecifically to the DNA probe as shown previously (23Amen M. Liu X. Vadlamudi U. Elizondo G. Diamond E. Engelhardt J.F. et al.PITX2 and Î²-catenin interactions regulate lef-1 isoform expression.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7560-7573Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, HMGN2 can bind to Lef-1 bound to DNA and remove Lef-1 from the DNA. This represents a unique function of HMGN2 to regulate transcription factor activity.Figure 3HMGN2 removes Lef-1 bound to DNA. HMGN2 protein (4, 10, 15, 20, and 40 ng) was incubated with the Dlx2 promoter sequence containing a Lef-1 binding element as the radioactive probe in an EMSA. HMGN2 bound nonspecifically to the DNA probe as previously reported. Lef-1 protein (80 ng) bound to the DNA. HMGN2 titration (4, 10, 15, 20, and 40 ng) after Lef-1 bound to the probe revealed that HMGN2 inhibited Lef-1 binding in a dose-responsive manner. The EMSA experiments were analyzed in 8% native polyacrylamide gels. The free and bound forms of DNA were quantitated using the Molecular Dynamics STORM PhosphoImager.

The Hmgn2 promoter has several Lef-1- and Pitx2-binding sites (Fig. S1A). We cloned the Hmgn2 promoter (11 kb) into a luciferase construct and transfected it with plasmid DNA encoding Lef-1, HMGN2, Î²-cat, and Pitx2 combinations in CHO cells. Our results showed that Lef-1 activates the Hmgn2 promoter at approximately sixfold, and addition of HMGN2 represses Lef-1 activation as predicted (Fig. S1B). Î²-cat derepresses the HMGN2 inhibition of Lef-1 transcriptional activation of the Hmgn2 promoter. Pitx2 activation of the Hmgn2 promoter is also repressed by HMGN2 and derepressed by addition of Î²-cat (Fig. S1B). We have shown previously that Î²-cat can derepress Pitx2 inhibition by HMGN2 by forming a complex that allows for Pitx2 binding to DNA (23Amen M. Liu X. Vadlamudi U. Elizondo G. Diamond E. Engelhardt J.F. et al.PITX2 and Î²-catenin interactions regulate lef-1 isoform expression.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7560-7573Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We speculate that a similar mechanism is working for Lef-1 transcriptional activation. We assayed for endogenous Hmgn2 transcripts isolated from E14.5 Pitx2âˆ’/âˆ’ null embryo mandibles and found that Hmgn2 transcripts were significantly decreased because of the lack of Pitx2 expression (Fig. S1C). Thus, both Lef-1 and Pitx2 appear to regulate Hmgn2 causing a new feedback mechanism where increased Hmgn2 protein would inhibit Pitx2 and Lef-1 activation of Hmgn2 expression.Dlx2 and FoxJ1 transcription factors are inhibited by HMGN2Dlx2 and FoxJ1 are transcription factors involved in the developmental regulation of the craniofacial region and teeth (42Green P.D.

This study investigated whether switching to peginterferon (PegIFN) alfa-2a after long-term NA therapy induced a durable viral response. Methods Patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive CHB who received any NA for at least 72 weeks and had a low level of HBV DNA (â‰¤100 IU/mL) were randomized (1:1) to receive PegIFN alfa-2a (180 Î¼g/week) or NA for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) titer during antiviral therapy. Results We randomized 149 CHB patients to the two groups. Compared to baseline, the HBsAg levels in both groups were not lower at week 12, but were lower after 24, 36, and 48 weeks (all p&lt;0.001). The maximal HBsAg decline in the PegIFN alfa-2a group was at week 36 (0.50Â±0.88 log 10 IU/mL), and this decline was smaller in the NA group (0.08Â±0.46 log 10 IU/mL). The percentage of patients with HBeAg seroconversion at week 48 was also greater in the PegIFN alfa-2a group (15/75 [20.0%] vs . 5/74 [6.8%], p = 0.018). Multivariable analysis indicated the PegIFN alfa-2a group had a greater change in HBeAg seroconversion at week 48 (p = 0.027). Patients had relatively good tolerance to PegIFN alfa-2a therapy. Conclusions CHB patients who switched to PegIFN alfa-2a for 48 weeks had a significantly lower HBsAg titer and increased HBeAg seroconversion relative to those who remained on NA therapy.

https://openalex.org/W4286586565,"Interval estimation with accurate coverage for risk difference (RD) in a correlated 2 Ã— 2 table with structural zero is a fundamental and important problem in biostatistics. The score test-based and Bayesian tail-based confidence intervals (CIs) have good coverage performance among the existing methods. However, as approximation approaches, they have coverage probabilities lower than the nominal confidence level for finite and moderate sample sizes. In this paper, we propose three new CIs for RD based on the fiducial, inferential model (IM) and modified IM (MIM) methods. The IM interval is proven to be valid. Moreover, simulation studies show that the CIs of fiducial and MIM methods can guarantee the preset coverage rate even for small sample sizes. More importantly, in terms of coverage probability and expected length, the MIM interval outperforms other intervals. Finally, a real example illustrates the application of the proposed methods."

However, screening programs continue to face implementation challenges, especially in developing country contexts. In this study, we use a mixed-methods approach to understand the reasons for no-show behaviour for cervical cancer screening appointments among hard-to-reach low-income women in BogotÃ¡, Colombia. In the quantitative phase, individual attendance probabilities are predicted using administrative records from an outreach program (N = 23384) using both LASSO regression and Random Forest methods. In the qualitative phase, semi-structured interviews are analysed to understand patient perspectives (N = 60). Both inductive and deductive coding are used to identify first-order categories and content analysis is facilitated using the Framework method. Quantitative analysis shows that younger patients and those living in zones of poverty are more likely to miss their appointments. Likewise, appointments scheduled on Saturdays, during the school vacation periods or with lead times longer than 10 days have higher no-show risk. Qualitative data shows that patients find it hard to navigate the service delivery process, face barriers accessing the health system and hold negative beliefs about cervical cytology."
https://openalex.org/W4286587499,"Soil disinfestation with steam was evaluated as an alternative to fumigation. Following soil disinfestation, plant health has traditionally been measured using plant size and yield. Plant health can be measured in a timely manner more efficiently, more easily and non-destructively using image analysis. We hypothesized that plant health could be quantified and treatments can be differentiated using an RGB (Red, Green, Blue) image analysis program, particularly by observing the greenness of plant leaves. However, plant size or the proportion of green area could be unreliable due to plant loss and cameraâ€™s position and angle. To this end, we decided to evaluate plant health by analyzing the RGB codes associated with the green color only, which detects the chlorophyll reflectance and nutrient status, noting that the degree of greenness within the green-leaf-area was not affected by the plant size. We identified five RGB codes that are commonly observed in the plant leaves and ordered them from dark green to light green. Among the five RGB codes, the relative percentage covered by the darkest green to the lightest green was significantly different between the steam and chloropicrin treatments and the control, and it was not significantly different between the steam and chloropicrin treatments. Furthermore, the result was correlated with the total yield, and the trend observed in the first year was replicated in the second year of this experiment. In this study, we demonstrate that the RGB image analysis can be used as an early marker of the treatment effect on the plant health and productivity."
