https://openalex.org/W3043431476,"The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been undergoing mutations and is highly glycosylated. It is critically important to investigate the biological significance of these mutations. Here, we investigated 80 variants and 26 glycosylation site modifications for the infectivity and reactivity to a panel of neutralizing antibodies and sera from convalescent patients. D614G, along with several variants containing both D614G and another amino acid change, were significantly more infectious. Most variants with amino acid change at receptor binding domain were less infectious, but variants including A475V, L452R, V483A, and F490L became resistant to some neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, the majority of glycosylation deletions were less infectious, whereas deletion of both N331 and N343 glycosylation drastically reduced infectivity, revealing the importance of glycosylation for viral infectivity. Interestingly, N234Q was markedly resistant to neutralizing antibodies, whereas N165Q became more sensitive. These findings could be of value in the development of vaccine and therapeutic antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W3045724532,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 20191,2 and is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic3. Vaccines are an essential countermeasure and are urgently needed to control the pandemic4. Here we show that the adenovirus-vector-based vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, which encodes the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, is immunogenic in mice and elicites a robust humoral and cell-mediated response. This response was predominantly mediated by type-1 T helper cells, as demonstrated by the profiling of the IgG subclass and the expression of cytokines. Vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (using either a prime-only or a prime–boost regimen) induced a balanced humoral and cellular immune response of type-1 and type-2 T helper cells in rhesus macaques. We observed a significantly reduced viral load in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lower respiratory tract tissue of vaccinated rhesus macaques that were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 compared with control animals, and no pneumonia was observed in vaccinated SARS-CoV-2-infected animals. However, there was no difference in nasal shedding between vaccinated and control SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques. Notably, we found no evidence of immune-enhanced disease after viral challenge in vaccinated SARS-CoV-2-infected animals. The safety, immunogenicity and efficacy profiles of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 against symptomatic PCR-positive COVID-19 disease will now be assessed in randomized controlled clinical trials in humans. The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 induces an immune response in rhesus macaques and leads to reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in respiratory tissues and an absence of pneumonia, but not to a reduction in nasal virus shedding, compared with unvaccinated animals."
https://openalex.org/W3045734160,"A safe and effective vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may be required to end the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic1-8. For global deployment and pandemic control, a vaccine that requires only a single immunization would be optimal. Here we show the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a single dose of adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vector-based vaccines expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein in non-human primates. Fifty-two rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were immunized with Ad26 vectors that encoded S variants or sham control, and then challenged with SARS-CoV-2 by the intranasal and intratracheal routes9,10. The optimal Ad26 vaccine induced robust neutralizing antibody responses and provided complete or near-complete protection in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal swabs after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Titres of vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies correlated with protective efficacy, suggesting an immune correlate of protection. These data demonstrate robust single-shot vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates. The optimal Ad26 vector-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, termed Ad26.COV2.S, is currently being evaluated in clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W3045870925,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has prioritized the development of small-animal models for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We adapted a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 by serial passaging in the respiratory tract of aged BALB/c mice. The resulting mouse-adapted strain at passage 6 (called MASCp6) showed increased infectivity in mouse lung and led to interstitial pneumonia and inflammatory responses in both young and aged mice after intranasal inoculation. Deep sequencing revealed a panel of adaptive mutations potentially associated with the increased virulence. In particular, the N501Y mutation is located at the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. The protective efficacy of a recombinant RBD vaccine candidate was validated by using this model. Thus, this mouse-adapted strain and associated challenge model should be of value in evaluating vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2."

https://openalex.org/W3045803172,"Cytoarchitecture is a basic principle of microstructural brain parcellation. We introduce Julich-Brain, a three-dimensional atlas containing cytoarchitectonic maps of cortical areas and subcortical nuclei. The atlas is probabilistic, which enables it to account for variations between individual brains. Building such an atlas was highly data- and labor-intensive and required the development of nested, interdependent workflows for detecting borders between brain areas, data processing, provenance tracking, and flexible execution of processing chains to handle large amounts of data at different spatial scales. Full cortical coverage was achieved by the inclusion of gap maps to complement cortical maps. The atlas is dynamic and will be adapted as mapping progresses; it is openly available to support neuroimaging studies as well as modeling and simulation; and it is interoperable, enabling connection to other atlases and resources."
https://openalex.org/W3046842728,"This study aimed to develop risk scores based on clinical characteristics at presentation to predict intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality in COVID-19 patients. 641 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were selected from 4997 persons under investigation. We performed a retrospective review of medical records of demographics, comorbidities and laboratory tests at the initial presentation. Primary outcomes were ICU admission and death. Logistic regression was used to identify independent clinical variables predicting the two outcomes. The model was validated by splitting the data into 70% for training and 30% for testing. Performance accuracy was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC). Five significant variables predicting ICU admission were lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, pulse oxygen saturation, smoking history, and lymphocyte count. Seven significant variables predicting mortality were heart failure, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulse oxygen saturation, heart rate, and age. The mortality group uniquely contained cardiopulmonary variables. The risk score model yielded good accuracy with an AUC of 0.74 ([95% CI, 0.63–0.85], p = 0.001) for predicting ICU admission and 0.83 ([95% CI, 0.73–0.92], p<0.001) for predicting mortality for the testing dataset. This study identified key independent clinical variables that predicted ICU admission and mortality associated with COVID-19. This risk score system may prove useful for frontline physicians in clinical decision-making under time-sensitive and resource-constrained environment."
https://openalex.org/W3046695191,"Structural biology studies performed inside cells can capture molecular machines in action within their native context. In this work, we developed an integrative in-cell structural approach using the genome-reduced human pathogen Mycoplasma pneumoniae We combined whole-cell cross-linking mass spectrometry, cellular cryo-electron tomography, and integrative modeling to determine an in-cell architecture of a transcribing and translating expressome at subnanometer resolution. The expressome comprises RNA polymerase (RNAP), the ribosome, and the transcription elongation factors NusG and NusA. We pinpointed NusA at the interface between a NusG-bound elongating RNAP and the ribosome and propose that it can mediate transcription-translation coupling. Translation inhibition dissociated the expressome, whereas transcription inhibition stalled and rearranged it. Thus, the active expressome architecture requires both translation and transcription elongation within the cell."

Colmer et al. analyzed 36 years of data and found that the spatial distribution of fine particulate matter concentrations has remained largely unchanged over that interval (see the Perspective by Ma). Although, fine particulate pollution levels have dropped overall, those areas that were most and least polluted in 1981 remain so today. We may have made important strides in pollution control, but we have been less successful in addressing disparities of exposure between communities. Science , this issue p. 575 ; see also p. 503"

https://openalex.org/W3045530700,"Electrophilic compounds originating from nature or chemical synthesis have profound effects on immune cells. These compounds are thought to act by cysteine modification to alter the functions of immune-relevant proteins; however, our understanding of electrophile-sensitive cysteines in the human immune proteome remains limited. Here, we present a global map of cysteines in primary human T cells that are susceptible to covalent modification by electrophilic small molecules. More than 3,000 covalently liganded cysteines were found on functionally and structurally diverse proteins, including many that play fundamental roles in immunology. We further show that electrophilic compounds can impair T cell activation by distinct mechanisms involving the direct functional perturbation and/or degradation of proteins. Our findings reveal a rich content of ligandable cysteines in human T cells and point to electrophilic small molecules as a fertile source for chemical probes and ultimately therapeutics that modulate immunological processes and their associated disorders."

Wei et al. found that bulk single crystals of indium selenide instead have excellent flexibility (see the Perspective by Han). The deformability comes from the compliant intralayer bonding between indium and selenium. The authors used these observations along with a previously discovered silver sulfide to determine a deformability factor for materials that may help find other deformable semiconductors.

https://openalex.org/W3045859819,"The coevolution of mammalian hosts and their beneficial commensal microbes has led to development of symbiotic host-microbiota relationships1. Epigenetic machinery permits mammalian cells to integrate environmental signals2; however, how these pathways are fine-tuned by diverse cues from commensal bacteria is not well understood. Here we reveal a highly selective pathway through which microbiota-derived inositol phosphate regulates histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) activity in the intestine. Despite the abundant presence of HDAC inhibitors such as butyrate in the intestine, we found that HDAC3 activity was sharply increased in intestinal epithelial cells of microbiota-replete mice compared with germ-free mice. This divergence was reconciled by the finding that commensal bacteria, including Escherichia coli, stimulated HDAC activity through metabolism of phytate and production of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3). Both intestinal exposure to InsP3 and phytate ingestion promoted recovery following intestinal damage. Of note, InsP3 also induced growth of intestinal organoids derived from human tissue, stimulated HDAC3-dependent proliferation and countered butyrate inhibition of colonic growth. Collectively, these results show that InsP3 is a microbiota-derived metabolite that activates a mammalian histone deacetylase to promote epithelial repair. Thus, HDAC3 represents a convergent epigenetic sensor of distinct metabolites that calibrates host responses to diverse microbial signals."

Here, we demonstrate that the Hippo kinases LATS1/2 and MST1/2, which inhibit YAP activity, are required for maintaining Wnt signaling and canonical stem cell function. Hippo inhibition induces a distinct epithelial cell state marked by low Wnt signaling, a wound-healing response, and transcription factor Klf6 expression. Notably, loss of LATS1/2 or overexpression of YAP is sufficient to reprogram Lgr5+ cancer stem cells to this state and thereby suppress tumor growth in organoids, patient-derived xenografts, and mouse models of primary and metastatic CRC. Finally, we demonstrate that genetic deletion of YAP and its paralog TAZ promotes the growth of these tumors.

Collectively, our results establish the role of YAP as a tumor suppressor in the adult colon and implicate Hippo kinases as therapeutic vulnerabilities in colorectal malignancies. The gut epithelium is organized in a monolayer of cells that carries out essential absorptive, barrier, and endocrine functions (Peterson and Artis, 2014Peterson L.W. Artis D. Intestinal epithelial cells: regulators of barrier function and immune homeostasis.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). Cellular turnover is sustained by highly proliferative Lgr5+ stem cells found at the bottom of intestinal and colonic crypts (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J. Kujala P. van den Born M. Cozijnsen M. Haegebarth A. Korving J. Begthel H. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Identification of stem cells in small intestine and colon by marker gene Lgr5.Nature. 2007; 449: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (3438) Google Scholar), and the presence of an active Wnt signaling pathway acts as a defining property for these stem cells. Wnt agonists are secreted by neighboring cells that form the niche, and cells undergo differentiation as they move up the crypt (Gehart and Clevers, 2019Gehart H. Clevers H. Tales from the crypt: new insights into intestinal stem cells.Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2019; 16: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Thus, regulated control of this pathway is essential for maintaining normal crypt structure and function. The transcriptional coactivator YAP, which is negatively regulated by the Hippo kinases MST1/2 and LATS1/2, plays an important role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. It has been shown to mediate epithelial repair following injury (Cai et al., 2010Cai J. Zhang N. Zheng Y. de Wilde R.F. Maitra A. Pan D.

We previously have shown that YAP overexpression in the intestine leads to Wnt inhibition and crypt degeneration (Barry et al., 2013Barry E.R. Morikawa T. Butler B.L. Shrestha K. de la Rosa R. Yan K.S. Fuchs C.S. Magness S.T. Smits R. Ogino S. et al.Restriction of intestinal stem cell expansion and the regenerative response by YAP.Nature. 2013; 493: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), but subsequent reports on the effects of YAP on Wnt signaling have been contradictory (Azzolin et al., 2014Azzolin L.

Yap-dependent reprogramming of Lgr5(+) stem cells drives intestinal regeneration and cancer.Nature. 2015; 526: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). YAP is also known to induce a transcriptional program that generally is associated with promoting stemness and proliferation (Fu et al., 2017Fu V. Plouffe S.W. Guan K.L. The Hippo pathway in organ development, homeostasis, and regeneration.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2017; 49: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and has been shown to function as an oncogene in a number of tissues, including pancreas, liver, and skin (Yu et al., 2015Yu F.-X. Zhao B. Guan K.-L. Hippo Pathway in Organ Size Control, Tissue Homeostasis, and Cancer.Cell. 2015; 163: 811-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Its role in colorectal cancer (CRC), however, is debated (Hong et al., 2016Hong A.W. Meng Z. Guan K.L. The Hippo pathway in intestinal regeneration and disease.Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2016; 13: 324-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The most common event that triggers the formation of colon tumors is the acquisition of mutations that constitutively activate Wnt signaling, which is thought to be the first step in the sequence that leads to malignant transformation of colon epithelial cells (Fearon and Vogelstein, 1990Fearon E.R. Vogelstein B. A genetic model for colorectal tumorigenesis.Cell. 1990; 61: 759-767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9464) Google Scholar; Siegel et al., 2014Siegel R. Desantis C. Jemal A. Colorectal cancer statistics, 2014.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2014; 64: 104-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar). The growth of colon tumors is driven by cancer stem cells that are labeled by Lgr5 as in healthy tissue (Merlos-Suárez et al., 2011Merlos-Suárez A. Barriga F.M. Jung P. Iglesias M. Céspedes M.V. Rossell D. Sevillano M. Hernando-Momblona X. da Silva-Diz V. Muñoz P. et al.The intestinal stem cell signature identifies colorectal cancer stem cells and predicts disease relapse.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 511-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar; Schepers et al., 2012Schepers A.G. Snippert H.J. Stange D.E. van den Born M. van Es J.H. van de Wetering M. Clevers H. Lineage tracing reveals Lgr5+ stem cell activity in mouse intestinal adenomas.Science. 2012; 337: 730-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). As targeting the Wnt pathway for the treatment of CRC has been historically challenging, the recent discovery that depletion of Lgr5+ cancer stem cells can arrest tumor growth and prevent metastasis in preclinical models has opened the door for developing strategies to specifically target this cell population (de Sousa e Melo et al., 2017de Sousa e Melo F. Kurtova A.V. Harnoss J.M. Kljavin N. Hoeck J.D. Hung J. Anderson J.E. Storm E.E. Modrusan Z. Koeppen H. et al.A distinct role for Lgr5+ stem cells in primary and metastatic colon cancer.Nature. 2017; 543: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar; Shimokawa et al., 2017Shimokawa M. Ohta Y. Nishikori S. Matano M. Takano A. Fujii M. Date S. Sugimoto S. Kanai T. Sato T. Visualization and targeting of LGR5+ human colon cancer stem cells.Nature. 2017; 545: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Thus, crosstalk between the Hippo and Wnt signaling pathways could serve as a potential therapeutic window for which treatment of CRC could be developed. Here, we use multiple genetic models to uncover a role for YAP in reprogramming gut epithelial cells into a state distinct from those found in steady-state intestine. This state is characterized molecularly by a wound-healing signature, expression of Krüppel-like factor 6 (Klf6), and low levels of Wnt signaling. Using mouse and human models of CRC, we show that YAP is capable of reprogramming cancer stem cells into a low Wnt, non-proliferative state, which leads to tumor regression in primary and metastatic disease. In addition, deletion of YAP favors growth of focally induced colonic tumors, further supporting the notion that YAP acts as a tumor suppressor in the colon and that targeting the Hippo kinases represents a novel therapeutic approach for combatting CRC. Our previous data show that overexpression of an active version of YAP in the mouse intestine leads to Wnt inhibition and degeneration of intestinal crypts (Barry et al., 2013Barry E.R. Morikawa T. Butler B.L. Shrestha K. de la Rosa R. Yan K.S. Fuchs C.S. Magness S.T. Smits R. Ogino S. et al.Restriction of intestinal stem cell expansion and the regenerative response by YAP.Nature. 2013; 493: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). To fully explore the cellular and molecular consequences of YAP dysregulation in the intestinal mucosa, we studied additional models of YAP activation via deletion of its upstream negative regulatory kinases LATS1/2 and MST1/2. First, we used a Lrig1-CreERT2 driver to delete the LATS1/2 kinases in mouse intestinal stem cells (ISCs) (hereafter referred to as Lats1/2 conditional knockout [cKO]) and transcriptionally profiled single cells isolated from the small intestine of these mice 7 days after one dose of tamoxifen injection (Figure S1A; Powell et al., 2012Powell A.E. Wang Y. Li Y. Poulin E.J. Means A.L. Washington M.K. Higginbotham J.N. Juchheim A. Prasad N.

Unsupervised clustering followed by uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) representation of the single-cell gene expression profiles reveals a distinct clustering of the Lats1/2-knockout cells from the control cells (Figure S1B; McInnes et al., 2018McInnes L. Healy J. Saul N. Großberger L. UMAP: uniform manifold approximation and projection.J. Open Source Softw. 2018; 3: 861Crossref Google Scholar). Although the cells in the controls could be identified by markers of normal intestinal cell states, the Lats1/2-knockout cells could not be assigned to any known intestinal cell type (Figures 1A, S1C, and S1D). The Lats1/2-knockout cells lack expression of characteristic markers of normal intestinal states but still belong to the intestinal lineage, as seen by expression of Villin1 and Cdx2 (Figure S1D), thus defining a distinct cell type not present in the homeostatic intestinal epithelium. Upregulated genes in Lats1/2-knockout cells relative to control cells are overrepresented in Gene Ontology (GO) terms involved in wound healing and actin reorganization, which have been associated with YAP activation (Cai et al., 2010Cai J.

Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) confirms that the Lats1/2-knockout cells are highly enriched for two previously published YAP gene signatures and reveals that they are negatively enriched for intestinal β-catenin targets compared with control stem cells (Figures S1E, S1F, and 1C; Barry et al., 2013Barry E.R.

Interestingly, these cells are also marked by high expression of the transcription factor Klf6, which has been characterized as an immediate-early gene in response to injury and implicated to be a tumor suppressor in CRC (Inuzuka et al., 1999Inuzuka H.

These findings altogether suggest a role for YAP in molecularly reprogramming epithelial cells into a distinct transcriptional state that is not present in steady-state intestine. To validate these results, we performed immunohistochemistry analysis of the intestine from Lats1/2 cKO mice 7 days post-tamoxifen treatment. This analysis reveals an accumulation of YAP in the nucleus and expression of the YAP target gene AmotL2 (Figure 1E). Consistent with the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, characteristic markers of normal intestinal cell states are not present, such as those associated with ISCs (Lgr5 and Olfm4) and secretory cells (LYZ) and a target of the Wnt signaling pathway (Axin2). Lats1/2-knockout cells retain their proliferative capacity, as observed by staining with Ki67, and show marked increase in Klf6 levels, corroborating our scRNA-seq findings of YAP-mediated induction of a distinct Klf6+ cell state. This loss of typical intestinal cellular organization was confirmed in additional models for activation of endogenous YAP through knockout of the MST1/2 kinases in Mst1−/− Mst2fl/fl mice via an intestinal-specific, developmental Villin-Cre driver and the adult-inducible Villin-CreERT2 driver (hereafter referred to as Mst1/2 cKO) (el Marjou et al., 2004el Marjou F.

Altogether, our results point to a requirement for Hippo kinases in maintaining Wnt signaling in ISCs and suggest that persistent YAP activation cannot sustain normal homeostasis. As YAP-expressing cells are transcriptionally distinct from normal ISCs, we examined their capacity to form organoids. To test the effect of YAP activation in organoids, we generated a colon organoid line that would allow inducible expression of YAPS127A, a transcriptionally active mutant form of YAP (hereafter referred to as tetO-YAP rtTA) (Figure S2A; Yimlamai et al., 2014Yimlamai D.

Induction of YAP expression by doxycycline for 48 h causes the organoids to lose single-cell, columnar organization and prevents them from growing or forming spheroids upon passage (Figure 2A). Lats1/2 cKO colon organoids upon 4-OHT treatment also exhibit a similar phenotype of not being able to grow or form three-dimensional structures (Figure 2B), which is not due to 4-OHT toxicity (Figure S2B). In both contexts of YAP activation, we observed upregulation of mRNA levels of YAP targets and downregulation of ISC and secretory cell markers and the Wnt target Axin2 (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2C). Histological analysis confirms these results and reveals a progressive loss of the monolayer structure, upregulation of Klf6 expression, and proliferation arrest (Figure 2E). These results collectively suggest that this Wnt-low, Klf6-high state induced by YAP is incompatible with organoid growth in vitro. To determine whether these YAP-expressing cells have functional stem cell activity in vivo, we leveraged lineage tracing in Lgr5-CreERT2-knockin mice to trace Lgr5+ ISCs with or without activation of YAP (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H.

Finegold M.J. et al.In vitro expansion of single Lgr5+ liver stem cells induced by Wnt-driven regeneration.Nature. 2013; 494: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). We induced YAP activation and tdTomato expression by intraperitoneal injection of tamoxifen and doxycycline in Lgr5-IRES-CreERT2 Col1a1tetO-YapS127A/+ Rosa26LSL-rtTA/LSL-Tomato mice (Figure 2F). Compared with the homogeneous Tomato labeling in control crypts 5 days post-induction, crypts with YAP-activated ISCs exhibit mosaic Tomato labeling in the small intestine (Figure 2G), indicating that YAP expression in ISCs negatively affects their ability to contribute to intestinal lineages. Indeed, these YAP-activated ISCs are pushed out of intestinal crypts and villi over the course of 10 days (Figure 2H), suggesting that these mutant cells are quickly replaced by wild-type ISCs. Similarly, lineage tracing in Lgr5-CreERT2 Lats1fl/fl Lats2fl/fl Rosa26mT/mG mice reveals progressive loss of GFP+ ISCs at 2 weeks and 1 month after tamoxifen induction (Figure S2D). Altogether, these models suggest that YAP activation within ISCs leads to loss of normal stem cell function in vivo. The activation of YAP previously has been shown to be required for mucosal regeneration in different models of intestinal and colonic injury (Cai et al., 2010Cai J. Zhang N. Zheng Y. de Wilde R.F.

Thus, we investigated whether such physiological activation of YAP via injury induces reprogramming of intestinal epithelial cells to this Wnt-low, Klf6+ state that we describe above. To characterize epithelial cells during wound healing, we induced a punch lesion in mice by colonoscopy and collected samples from injured animals after 6 days (Seno et al., 2009Seno H. Miyoshi H. Brown S.L. Geske M.J. Colonna M. Stappenbeck T.S. Efficient colonic mucosal wound repair requires Trem2 signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sc. U S A. 2009; 106: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Histological analysis reveals an increased accumulation of YAP in the nucleus of epithelial cells at sites of wound healing and concomitant upregulation of Klf6 and the YAP target AmotL2 compared with uninjured controls (Figure 3A). Intriguingly, these areas are also depleted of Lgr5+ ISCs and Reg4+ deep crypt secretory (DCS) cells, suggesting that physiological regeneration activates a transcriptional state similar to that which we observed in Lats1/2 cKO and Mst1/2 cKO animals. In a second model of colonic injury, we induced acute inflammation in adult mice by supplementing drinking water with 3.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 5 days (Figure 3B), which leads to a loss of colonic crypts and immune cell infiltration (Figure S3A). Three days after DSS washout, crypts in inflamed areas of the colon show marked activation of YAP, increased Klf6 expression, and loss of Lgr5 and Reg4 markers (Figure 3C). These data altogether suggest that YAP activation is a general and specific response to injury in the colon during regeneration. To characterize the molecular changes in the colonic epithelium during regeneration, we performed scRNA-seq on epithelial cells isolated from DSS-treated and control mice (Figure S3B). UMAP representation of the transcriptomic profiles reveals that DSS-treated cells, despite being distinct from control cells (Figure S3C), maintain some features of normal colonic cells and could be assigned to known colonic cell types by marker expression (Figures S3D–S3F). As reported previously (Yui et al., 2018Yui S. Azzolin L. Maimets M. Pedersen M.T. Fordham R.P. Hansen S.L. Larsen H.L. Guiu J. Alves M.R.P. Rundsten C.F. et al.YAP/TAZ-dependent reprogramming of colonic epithelium links ECM remodeling to tissue regeneration.Cell Stem Cell. 2018; 22: 35-49.e7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), the DSS sample presents with upregulation of Ly6a/Sca1 transcript levels (Figure S3G). Differentially expressed genes between DSS and control cells are positively enriched for wound-healing response, cell-cell contact pathways, and YAP gene signatures and are negatively enriched for a previously published ISC gene signature (Figures 3D, 3E, S3H, and S3I; Table S2; Barry et al., 2013Barry E.R.

Remarkably, this DSS injury signature is highly enriched in the transcriptomes of Lats1/2-knockout cells (Figure 3F). Collectively, these data suggest that the cellular state induced by knockout of Lats1/2 or activation of YAP likely represents the physiological equivalent of a transiently repairing cell state. The fact that YAP remodels stem cells in vitro even in the presence of exogenous Wnt signals prompted us to analyze the effect of YAP in the context of constitutively active Wnt. To assess the role of YAP in this process, we introduced an Apc mutation via CRISPR-Cas9 into tetO-YAP rtTA colon organoids (Figure S4A). Strikingly, Apc−/− organoids lose their characteristic spheroid structure as early as 3 days after doxycycline treatment and could not grow after passage (Figure 4A). Lrig1-CreERT2-mediated deletion of Lats1/2 in Apc mutant organoids results in a similar growth inhibition upon plating (Figure 4B). As in Apc wild-type organoids, YAP targets and Klf6 are upregulated along with concomitant downregulation of ISC, DCS, and Wnt markers (Figures 4C–4E and S4B). These results show that YAP is able to suppress Wnt and the colonic stem cell program, even in the presence of constitutive Wnt signaling caused by the deletion of Apc. To determine whether this reprogramming is mediated through YAP’s transcriptional or cytoplasmic function, we generated Apc−/− CAGs-rtTA3 organoids, carrying inducible expression of either YAP5SA or YAP5SA/S94A (see STAR Methods; Premsrirut et al., 2011Premsrirut P.K.

Lacking medical prophylactic measures to combat disease spread, many nations have adopted social distancing policies in order to mitigate transmission of CoV-2. While mathematical models have suggested the efficacy of social distancing to curb the spread of CoV-2, there is a lack of systematic studies to quantify the real-world efficacy of these approaches. Here, we first demonstrate that implementation of social distancing policies in US states corresponded with a reduction in COVID19 spread rates, and that the reduction in spread rate is proportional to the average change in mobility. We validate this observation on a worldwide scale by analyzing COVID19 spread rate in 134 nations with varying social distancing policies. Globally, we find that social distancing policies significantly reduced the COVID19 spread rate, with resulting in an estimated 65% reduction (95% CI = 39–80%) in new COVID19 cases over a two week time period. These data suggest that social distancing policies may be a powerful tool to prevent spread of COVID19 in real-world scenarios."

Kinetic and structural data suggest that ABE8e catalyzes DNA deamination up to ~1100-fold faster than earlier ABEs because of mutations that stabilize DNA substrates in a constrained, transfer RNA-like conformation. Furthermore, ABE8e's accelerated DNA deamination suggests a previously unobserved transient DNA melting that may occur during double-stranded DNA surveillance by CRISPR-Cas9. These results explain ABE8e-mediated base-editing outcomes and inform the future design of base editors."
https://openalex.org/W3045750571,"Members of the conserved Argonaute protein family use small RNA guides to locate their mRNA targets and regulate gene expression and suppress mobile genetic elements in eukaryotes1,2. Argonautes are also present in many bacterial and archaeal species3–5. Unlike eukaryotic proteins, several prokaryotic Argonaute proteins use small DNA guides to cleave DNA, a process known as DNA interference6–10. However, the natural functions and targets of DNA interference are poorly understood, and the mechanisms of DNA guide generation and target discrimination remain unknown. Here we analyse the activity of a bacterial Argonaute nuclease from Clostridium butyricum (CbAgo) in vivo. We show that CbAgo targets multicopy genetic elements and suppresses the propagation of plasmids and infection by phages. CbAgo induces DNA interference between homologous sequences and triggers DNA degradation at double-strand breaks in the target DNA. The loading of CbAgo with locus-specific small DNA guides depends on both its intrinsic endonuclease activity and the cellular double-strand break repair machinery. A similar interaction was reported for the acquisition of new spacers during CRISPR adaptation, and prokaryotic genomes that encode Ago nucleases are enriched in CRISPR–Cas systems. These results identify molecular mechanisms that generate guides for DNA interference and suggest that the recognition of foreign nucleic acids by prokaryotic defence systems involves common principles. Argonaute protein from the bacterium C. butyricum targets multicopy genetic elements and functions in the suppression of plasmid and phage propagation, and there appears to be a DNA-mediated immunity pathway in prokaryotes."

The kinetics of the response is different for the two receptors. Based on structural and spectroscopic data, Hilger et al. show that the conformation of transmembrane helix 6 in the activated state is a key differentiator (see the Perspective by Lebon). In β 2 AR, the helix moves toward its active conformation when an agonist binds, but in GCGR, both agonist and G protein binding are required. This likely explains why activation of its partner G protein is slower for GCGR than for β 2 AR. Science , this issue p. eaba3373 ; see also p. 507"

Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we simultaneously quantitated the phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) of all CD3 chains upon TCR stimulation. A subpopulation of CD3ε ITAMs was mono-phosphorylated, owing to Lck kinase selectivity, and specifically recruited the inhibitory Csk kinase to attenuate TCR signaling, suggesting that TCR is a self-restrained signaling machinery containing both activating and inhibitory motifs. Moreover, we found that incorporation of the CD3ε cytoplasmic domain into a second-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) improved antitumor activity of CAR-T cells. Mechanistically, the Csk-recruiting ITAM of CD3ε reduced CAR-T cytokine production whereas the basic residue rich sequence (BRS) of CD3ε promoted CAR-T persistence via p85 recruitment. Collectively, CD3ε is a built-in multifunctional signal tuner, and increasing CD3 diversity represents a strategy to design next-generation CAR."

Thus, it is important to understand how global factors linked with the functioning of the Anthropocene are responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak. We tested hypotheses that the number of COVID-19 cases, number of deaths and growth rate of recorded infections: (1) are positively associated with population density as well as (2) proportion of the human population living in urban areas as a proxies of interpersonal contact rate, (3) age of the population in a given country as an indication of that population's susceptibility to COVID-19; (4) net migration rate and (5) number of tourists as proxies of infection pressure, and negatively associated with (5) gross domestic product which is a proxy of health care quality. Data at the country level were compiled from publicly available databases and analysed with gradient boosting regression trees after controlling for confounding factors (e.g. geographic location). We found a positive association between the number of COVID-19 cases in a given country and gross domestic product, number of tourists, and geographic longitude. The number of deaths was positively associated with gross domestic product, number of tourists in a country, and geographic longitude. The effects of gross domestic product and number of tourists were non-linear, with clear thresholds above which the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths increased rapidly. The growth rate of COVID-19 cases was positively linked to the number of tourists and gross domestic product. The growth rate of COVID-19 cases was negatively associated with the mean age of the population and geographic longitude. Growth was slower in less urbanised countries. This study demonstrates that the characteristics of the human population and high mobility, but not population density, may help explain the global spread of the virus. In addition, geography, possibly via climate, may play a role in the pandemic. The unexpected positive and strong association between gross domestic product and number of cases, deaths, and growth rate suggests that COVID-19 may be a new civilisation disease affecting rich economies."

We here show that the C-terminal noncatalytic region of ICK interacts with the intraflagellar transport (IFT)–B complex of the IFT machinery and participates in its transport to the ciliary tip. Furthermore, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that ICK undergoes bidirectional movement within cilia, similarly to IFT particles. Analysis of ICK knockout cells demonstrated that ICK deficiency severely impairs the retrograde trafficking of IFT particles and ciliary G protein–coupled receptors. In addition, we found that in ICK knockout cells, ciliary proteins are accumulated at the bulged ciliary tip, which appeared to be torn off and released into the environment as an extracellular vesicle.

Primary cilia are microtubule-based projections found on a variety of eukaryotic cells and serve as mechanosensors for extracellular stimuli, such as fluid flow, and as chemosensors for signaling molecules, such as the Hedgehog (Hh) morphogen (1Bangs F. Anderson K.V. Primary cilia and mammalian hedgehog signaling.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2017; 9 (27881449): a02817510.1101/cshperspect.a028175Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To fulfill these functions, the ciliary membrane has specific receptors and ion channels. In addition, to maintain the integrity of the axonemal microtubules, αβ-tubulin dimers and associated molecules are continuously transported toward the ciliary tip (2Bhogaraju S. Weber K. Engel B.D. Lechtreck K.-F. Lorentzen E. Getting tubulin to the tip of the cilium: one IFT train, many different tubulin cargo binding sites?.Bioessays. 2014; 36 (24616010): 463-46710.1002/bies.201400007Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The protein and lipid compositions of the membrane and interior of cilia are distinguished from those of the plasma membrane and cytoplasm, respectively, by the presence of the transition zone (TZ) as a permeability/diffusion barrier (3Garcia-Gonzalo F.R.

The functions and assembly of cilia are therefore dependent not only on the bidirectional trafficking of proteins along the axonemal microtubules but also on their restrictive import and export across the TZ. Reflecting their crucial roles, defects in protein trafficking within cilia result in various hereditary disorders, which are generally termed as the ciliopathies (4Reiter J.F. Leroux M.R.

Marshall W.F. Ciliogenesis: building the cell's antenna.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12 (21427764): 222-23410.1038/nrm3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 7Sung C.-H. Leroux M.R.

The IFT machinery is composed of two large protein complexes, IFT-B and IFT-A. The IFT-B complex composed of 16 subunits mediates anterograde protein trafficking from the base to the tip driven by the kinesin-2 motor, and the IFT-A complex composed of six subunits together with the TULP3 adaptor protein mediates retrograde trafficking from the tip to the base driven by the dynein-2 motor complex (8Taschner M.

Compared with the mechanisms of the IFT-B–mediated anterograde trafficking and the IFT-A–mediated retrograde trafficking, little is known about the turnaround event at the ciliary tip, where the IFT machinery is remodeled and the anterograde kinesin-2 motor is replaced with the retrograde dynein-2 motor (6Ishikawa H.

A candidate key regulator of the turnaround event is intestinal cell kinase (ICK; recently renamed CILK1 for ciliogenesis-associated kinase 1), which belongs to the mitogen-activated protein kinase superfamily (19Fu Z.

Utilizing the visible immunoprecipitation (VIP) assay, we here show that ICK interacts with the IFT-B complex via its C-terminal noncatalytic region; this is in agreement with a recent study showing that an ICK construct lacking the noncatalytic region could not localize to cilia (37Oh Y.S. Wang E.J. Gailey C.D. Brautigan D.L. Allen B.L. Fu Z. Ciliopathy-associated protein kinase ICK requires its non-catalytic carboxyl-terminal domain for regulation of ciliogenesis.Cells. 2019; 8 (31277411): 67710.3390/cells8070677Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In addition, by analyzing the phenotypes of ICK-KO cells and those exogenously expressing WT ICK and its mutants, we show that the IFT-dependent anterograde transport of ICK, as well as its kinase activity, is required for normal ciliogenesis and retrograde ciliary protein trafficking, probably by regulating the turnaround event at the tip. ICK has a kinase domain in its N-terminal (NT) region and a C-terminal (CT) noncatalytic region (Fig. 1A). We divided the ICK protein into the NT (residues 1–287) and CT (residues 285–632) regions. When the ICK constructs fused to mCherry (mChe) were expressed in human telomerase reverse transcriptase–immortalized retinal pigment epithelial 1 (hTERT-RPE1) cells, which are then serum-starved to induce ciliogenesis, mChe-ICK(CT) and mChe-ICK(WT), but not mChe-ICK(NT), were often found localized at the ciliary tip (Fig. 1B, panels a–c), indicating that the noncatalytic region is responsible for the localization of ICK to the ciliary tip. In support of our observations, while this study was in progress, Oh et al. (37Oh Y.S. Wang E.J. Gailey C.D. Brautigan D.L. Allen B.L. Fu Z. Ciliopathy-associated protein kinase ICK requires its non-catalytic carboxyl-terminal domain for regulation of ciliogenesis.Cells. 2019; 8 (31277411): 67710.3390/cells8070677Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) reported that an ICK construct (residues 1–291) lacking the noncatalytic region did not show ciliary localization. We recently showed that KIF17, which is homodimeric kinesin-2, and is localized at the ciliary tip in mammalian cells, is transported to the tip via its binding to the IFT-B complex (38Funabashi T. Katoh Y. Michisaka S. Terada M. Sugawa M. Nakayama K. Ciliary entry of KIF17 is dependent on its binding to the IFT-B complex via IFT46-IFT56 as well as on its nuclear localization signal.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2017; 28 (28077622): 624-63310.1091/mbc.E16-09-0648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, an interactome study suggested that ICK interacts, either directly or indirectly, with some IFT-B subunits (39Boldt K. van Reeuwijk J. Lu Q. Koutroumpas K. Nguyen T.M. Texier Y. van Beersum S.E.C. Horn N. Willer J.R. Mans D. Dougherty G. Lamers I.J. Coene K.L. Arts H.H.

In addition, as described below, ICK undergoes bidirectional movement within cilia, similarly to IFT particles. We therefore analyzed whether ICK is also transported to the ciliary tip via binding to the IFT machinery. To this end, we utilized the VIP assay, which we recently developed as a convenient and versatile screening strategy that allows visual detection of not only binary protein–protein interactions but also one-to-many and many-to-many protein interactions (40Katoh Y.

When lysates of HEK293T cells coexpressing EGFP-ICK and all the 6 IFT-A subunits or all the 16 IFT-B subunits fused to mChe were processed for immunoprecipitation with GSH S-transferase (GST)–tagged anti-GFP nanobodies (Nbs) prebound to GSH-Sepharose beads, EGFP-ICK coprecipitated mChe-IFT-B (Fig. 1C, fourth column) but not mChe-IFT-A (first column). When the ICK protein was divided into the NT and CT regions, only the ICK(CT) construct fused to EGFP coimmunoprecipitated mChe-IFT-B (sixth column). The VIP results were confirmed by immunoblotting analysis; many bands for the mChe-fused IFT-B subunits were detected when coexpressed with EGFP-fused ICK(WT) and ICK(CT) (Fig. 1D, lanes 5 and 7). These results of the VIP assay and immunoblotting are compatible with the above observation that ICK(CT) and ICK(WT) are transported to the ciliary tip (Fig. 1B). When the IFT-B subunits were grouped into those of the core 1 (IFT-B1-1), core 2 (IFT-B1-2), and peripheral (IFT-B2) subcomplexes, and those of the connecting tetramer (42Katoh Y. Terada M.

We then made use of the subtraction VIP assay to determine which of the core 2 subunits contribute to the ICK(CT) interaction. When one of the core 2 subunits was omitted from the coimmunoprecipitation assay, the signals were considerably decreased in the absence of IFT46, IFT52, or IFT56 (Fig. 1, G, second through fourth columns, and H, lanes 2–4). However, IFT46 + IFT52 + IFT56 was not sufficient, because the signals in the presence of all the core 2 subunits were much more intense than those in the presence of only IFT46+IFT52+IFT56 (compare lane 1 with lane 8). We also performed the subtraction VIP assay for subunits of the peripheral subcomplex. The results showed that among the peripheral subunits, IFT172 makes a major contribution to the ICK(CT) interaction (Fig. 1, I, seventh column, and J, lane 7), and IFT38 and IFT80 also contribute to the interaction (third and sixth columns and lanes 3 and 6). We then narrowed down the area within the ICK CT region that is responsible for its interaction with IFT-B core 2 and the peripheral subcomplexes. Truncation of ICK(CT) to residue 561 from the C terminus (residue 632) did not apparently diminish its interaction with the IFT-B core 2 subunits (Fig. 2, A, second column, and B, lane 2). Truncation to residue 537 slightly diminished the interaction (Fig. 2, compare third column in A and lane 3 in B with first column in A and lane 1 in B, respectively). When the ICK(CT) construct was truncated to residue 501, virtually no interaction with the core 2 subunits was detected (Fig. 2, A, fourth column, and B, lane 4). In the case of the IFT-B peripheral subunits, truncation of ICK(CT) to residue 501 from the C terminus did not significantly affect its interaction with the peripheral subunits (Fig. 2, C, first through third columns, and D, lanes 1–3), and truncation to residue 473 slightly diminished the interaction (fourth column and lane 4). However, truncation to residue 361 abolished the interaction of ICK(CT) with the IFT-B peripheral subunits (fifth column and lane 5). Thus, distinct parts of the broad noncatalytic region participate in the interaction of ICK with the core 2 and peripheral subunits of the IFT-B complex, although it is unknown whether or not these regions overlap with each other. Because the noncatalytic region of ICK was suggested to have characteristics of intrinsically disordered proteins (19Fu Z. Gailey C.D. Wang E.J. Brautigan D.L. Ciliogenesis associated kinase 1: targets and functions in various organ systems.FEBS Lett. 2019; 593 (31506943): 2990-300210.1002/1873-3468.13600Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 37Oh Y.S.

We then analyzed whether the ICK truncation constructs can localize to the ciliary tip. When expressed in hTERT-RPE1 cells, mChe-ICK(1–561) and mChe-ICK(WT) were found at the distal tip (Fig. 2E, panels a and b). mChe-ICK(1–537) was also able to localize to the tip (Fig. 2E, panel c), but with much lower efficiency (Fig. 2G). In striking contrast, virtually no ciliary signal was detected for mChe-ICK(1–501) and mChe-ICK(1–473) (Fig. 2E, panels d and e; also see Fig. 2G). Taken together with the interaction data (Fig. 2, A–D), the localization of ICK to the ciliary tip appears to correlate with its binding to the IFT-B complex, at least to the core 2 subcomplex. To confirm the IFT-B–dependent transport of ICK to the tip, we used IFT56-KO cells. Although the absence of an IFT-B subunit in many cases results in a cilia-lacking phenotype (9Nakayama K. Katoh Y.

https://openalex.org/W3045672604,"We propose a new optical method based on comparative holographic projection for visual comparison between two abnormal follow-up magnetic resonance (MR) exams of glioblastoma patients to effectively visualize and assess tumor progression. First, the brain tissue and tumor areas are segmented from the MR exams using the fast marching method (FMM). The FMM approach is implemented on a computed pixel weight matrix based on an automated selection of a set of initialized target points. Thereafter, the associated phase holograms are calculated for the segmented structures based on an adaptive iterative Fourier transform algorithm (AIFTA). Within this approach, a spatial multiplexing is applied to reduce the speckle noise. Furthermore, hologram modulation is performed to represent two different reconstruction schemes. In both schemes, all calculated holograms are superimposed into a single two-dimensional (2D) hologram which is then displayed on a reflective phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) for optical reconstruction. The optical reconstruction of the first scheme displays a 3D map of the tumor allowing to visualize the volume of the tumor after treatment and at the progression. Whereas, the second scheme displays the follow-up exams in a side-by-side mode highlighting tumor areas, so the assessment of each case can be fast achieved. The proposed system can be used as a valuable tool for interpretation and assessment of the tumor progression with respect to the treatment method providing an improvement in diagnosis and treatment planning."

Effective treatment of HIV infection has reduced the rate of progression and severity but not the overall prevalence of HANDs, suggesting ongoing pathological process even when viral replication is suppressed. In this study, we investigated how HIV-1 protein Nef secreted in extracellular vesicles (exNef) impairs neuronal functionality. ExNef were rapidly taken up by neural cells in vitro, reducing the abundance of ABC transporter A1 (ABCA1) and thus cholesterol efflux and increasing the abundance and modifying lipid rafts in neuronal plasma membranes. ExNef caused a redistribution of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Tau to lipid rafts and increased the abundance of these proteins, as well as of Aβ42. ExNef further potentiated phosphorylation of Tau and activation of inflammatory pathways. These changes were accompanied by neuronal functional impairment. Disruption of lipid rafts with cyclodextrin reversed the phenotype. Short-term treatment of C57BL/6 mice with either purified recombinant Nef or exNef similarly resulted in reduced abundance of ABCA1 and elevated abundance of APP in brain tissue. The abundance of ABCA1 in brain tissue of HIV-infected human subjects diagnosed with HAND was lower, and the abundance of lipid rafts was higher compared with HIV-negative individuals. Levels of APP and Tau in brain tissue correlated with the abundance of Nef. Thus, modification of neuronal cholesterol trafficking and of lipid rafts by Nef may contribute to early stages of neurodegeneration and pathogenesis in HAND.

With aging of HIV-infected population and dramatically extended life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH), this condition constitutes a significant health problem. HAND has clinical features characteristic for a neurodegenerative disorder: a spectrum of declining cognitive functions, behavioral changes, and motor impairment. Pathologically, there may or may not be focal damage to the gray matter, and there are abnormalities in the white matter (4Brew B.J. Crowe S.M. Landay A. Cysique L.A. Guillemin G. Neurodegeneration and ageing in the HAART era.J. Neuroimmune Pharmacol. 2009; 4 (19067177): 163-17410.1007/s11481-008-9143-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Overall, HAND is consistent with the definition of a neurodegenerative disease as a condition with progressive neuronal damage and chronic loss of neurons (4Brew B.J. Crowe S.M. Landay A.

In treated patients, however, pathological features may be modest, pointing to more subtle changes to the synaptodendritic architecture manifesting in functional impairment. However, the pathogenetic mechanisms of neural impairment in PLWH are not fully understood. Cholesterol metabolism and dysregulation of lipid rafts were shown to play a key role in pathogenesis of neural damage in many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, and prion diseases (5Schengrund C.L.

Replication of HIV critically depends on modification of host cholesterol metabolism and lipid rafts through the action of HIV-1 protein Nef (9Waheed A.A. Freed E.O.

Nef reduces the level of the cellular cholesterol transporter ABCA1 inducing accumulation of intracellular cholesterol and overabundance and pathological changes in lipid rafts (10Mujawar Z. Rose H.

It was demonstrated in our previous study that the effects of EVs produced by Nef-expressing cells on cholesterol metabolism and lipid rafts are similar to the effects of EVs produced by HIV-infected myeloid cells, whereas EVs from cells infected with ΔNefHIV did not have such effects (13Mukhamedova N.

To determine whether differentiated SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells could take up the EVs, we labeled EVs with fluorescent dye PKH67. EV uptake was slow over the first 4 h but increased in a linear fashion over the following 4 h (Fig. 1, A and B). No fluorescence was found inside the cells when BSA instead of EVs was added to the stain solution and incubated with cells for 8 h (Fig. 1A, last panel), suggesting that EVs were taken up by SH-SY5Y cells. To determine whether EVs could deliver Nef into cells, we incubated EVs containing Nef tagged with GFP (exGFP-Nef) with the cells for 24 h and used anti-GFP antibody to enhance the detection signal. GFP-Nef was detected inside the cells after a 24-h incubation and intracellular abundance of Nef continued to rise for at least another 24 h (Fig. 1, C and D). Thus, exNef was actively taken up by SH-SY5Y cells delivering Nef to the cell interior. We have previously demonstrated that Nef expressed in macrophages infected with HIV-1 or transfected with heterologous Nef, as well as delivered to cells by incubation with the recombinant Nef or Nef-containing EVs, reduces the abundance of ABCA1 and the rate of cholesterol efflux in macrophages (10Mujawar Z.

Similar effects were observed when we tested the effects of 48 h of incubation with exNef (final concentration, 0.4 ng/ml) on SH-SY5Y neural cells. The abundance of total and cell surface ABCA1 and the rate of cholesterol efflux were reduced by 35% (n = 3) and 3-fold, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). Another effect of Nef was elevation of the abundance of lipid rafts. Incubation of exNef with SH-SY5Y cells for 48 h also led to elevation of the abundance of lipid rafts as determined by confocal microscopy after staining with fluorescently tagged cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) (Fig. 2, C and D). To ensure that the effects of exNef can be attributed to Nef and not to a Nef-induced factor that may be carried by EVs produced by Nef-expressing cells, we incubated SH-SY5Y cells with myristoylated recombinant Nef (final concentration, 100 ng/ml). Recombinant Nef also caused elevation of the abundance of lipid rafts as determined by CTB binding and confocal microscopy (Fig. 2E) or flow cytometry (Fig. 2F), although the effects were less pronounced than with exNef and required higher concentration of Nef, similar to what was seen with macrophages (13Mukhamedova N. Hoang A. Dragoljevic D. Dubrovsky L. Pushkarsky T. Low H. Ditiatkovski M. Fu Y. Ohkawa R. Meikle P.J. Horvath A. Brichacek B. Miller Y.I. Murphy A.

Next, we labeled cells with [3H]cholesterol and isolated lipid rafts from plasma membranes using density gradient centrifugation. Fractions containing the highest concentrations of [3H]cholesterol and lipid raft marker flotillin-1 were designated as lipid rafts; both markers co-distributed along the density gradient (Fig. 2, G and H). When we compared lipid rafts isolated from cells treated with exNef and exGFP, we found that lipid raft fractions from cells treated with exNef contained more cholesterol and more flotillin-1 than fractions from cells treated with exGFP. Furthermore, the density of the fractions containing maximum amounts of cholesterol and flotillin-1 was lower (lighter fractions) in cells treated with exNef (Fig. 2, G and H). These findings are consistent with lipid rafts in cells treated with exNef being more abundant and possibly bigger. Elevation of the abundance of lipid rafts may cause elevation of the abundance of lipid raft-associated amyloidogenic proteins. We tested the effect of exNef on the abundance of several amyloidogenic proteins in cell lysates and found elevated abundance of APP and Tau in cells treated with exNef (Fig. 3, A and B). This was confirmed with an independent method, confocal microscopy. Staining for APP and Tau on cell membranes was elevated in cells treated with exNef as compared with cells treated with exGFP (Fig. 3, C and D). We then used ELISA to evaluate the amount of amyloid Aβ42. The abundance of Aβ42 in cells treated with exNef tripled compared with cells treated with exGFP (Fig. 3E); the abundance of Aβ42 in the medium after 24 and 48 h of incubation was below the detection limit of the method. There was no difference in the abundance of α-synuclein and l-neurofilament in the cells (not shown). Several reports indicated that an essential step in formation of Tau microfilaments is hyperphosphorylation of Tau (24Stoothoff W.H. Johnson G.V. Tau phosphorylation: physiological and pathological consequences.Biochim. Biophys.

Therefore, we assessed the abundance of phosphorylated Tau (pTau) in the plasma membranes of SH-SY5Y neural cells using Western blotting. Treatment of cells with exNef resulted in elevation in the abundance of pTau in parallel with increased total abundance of Tau (Fig. 3F). Interestingly, we also found that treatment with exNef increased the abundance of total and phosphorylated of ERK 1/2 (Fig. 3F), which may contribute, on the one hand, to hyperphosphorylation of Tau (26Qi H. Prabakaran S. Cantrelle F.-X. Chambraud B. Gunawardena J. Lippens G. Landrieu I. Characterization of neuronal Tau protein as a target of extracellular signal–regulated kinase.J. Biol.

The increased pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic signaling induced by exNef was further supported by elevation in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in cells treated with exNef (Fig. 3G). Next, we assessed the cellular localization of APP and Tau in SH-SY5Y cells using confocal microscopy. Localization of APP and Tau in the SH-SY5Y cells is shown in Fig. 4 (A and B, respectively); most of APP and Tau localized at the plasma membranes and co-localized with lipid rafts. The co-localization of these proteins with lipid rafts was measured as Manders' co-localization coefficient (M2) (27Costes S.V. Daelemans D. Cho E.H. Dobbin Z. Pavlakis G. Lockett S. Automatic and quantitative measurement of protein–protein colocalization in live cells.Biophys.

We found that treatment of cells with exNef increased co-localization of both APP and Tau with lipid rafts (Fig. 4, A–D). We then isolated lipid rafts by density gradient centrifugation and determined the abundance of flotillin-1 and APP in individual fractions. Higher abundance of APP was found in lipid raft fractions of cells treated with exNef compared with that of cells treated with exGFP (Fig. 4E). We next probed the abundance of flotillin-1, APP, and phosphorylated Tau by Western blotting in combined raft or nonraft fractions. There was considerably higher abundance of flotillin-1 in raft fractions; rafts from exNef-treated cells had more flotillin-1 than rafts from cells treated with exGFP (Fig. 4F). All detectable APP was found in raft fractions of exNef-treated cells; APP abundance in nonraft fractions of exNef-treated cells, as well as in both raft and nonraft fractions of exGFP-treated cells, was very low. Phosphorylated Tau was found in both raft and nonraft fractions with higher abundance in exNef-treated cells (Fig. 4F). Saribas et al. (17Saribas A.S. Cicalese S. Ahooyi T.M. Khalili K. Amini S. Sariyer I.K. HIV-1 Nef is released in extracellular vesicles derived from astrocytes: evidence for Nef-mediated neurotoxicity.Cell Death Dis. 2017; 8 (28079886): e254210.1038/cddis.2016.467Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) found no effect of Nef expression in SH-SY5Y cells on the level of phosphorylated Tau. However, that study analyzed phosphorylated Tau in cell lysates as opposed to plasma membranes analyzed in our experiments. Previously, the neuropathic effects of Nef were attributed to its toxicity at high concentrations. However, when we tested for toxic effects of exNef at concentration and conditions of this study, exNef did not cause elevation of the rates of necrosis (Fig. 5A) or apoptosis (Fig. 5B) in SH-SY5Y cells. Two functional assays were employed to test whether exNef causes functional impairment in neural cells. First, we tested excitotoxicity by measuring susceptibility of SH-SY5Y cells to glutamate-induced apoptosis. This pathway of cell injury plays an integral role in pathogenesis of a number of neurodegenerative disorders, including AD and Parkinson's disease (28Choi D.W. Excitotoxic cell death.J.

Consistent with lack of general toxicity, exNef did not cause an elevation of the proportion of dead cells in culture in the absence of glutamate (Fig. 5C). However, when treated with 50 μm glutamate, the apoptosis of neural cells pretreated with exNef was significantly increased (Fig. 5C). Second, we tested the activity of acetylcholine esterase (AChE), a measure of cholinergic hypofunction, which was linked to cognitive decline (30Madhusudan A. Sidler C. Knuesel I. Accumulation of reelin-positive plaques is accompanied by a decline in basal forebrain projection neurons during normal aging.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2009; 30 (19735296): 1064-107610.1111/j.1460-9568.2009.06884.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The activity of AChE in cells pretreated with exNef was significantly higher than in cells pretreated with exGFP (Fig. 5D). To confirm that functional changes in neural cells caused by exNef were due to modification of lipid rafts, we tested whether reversal of the effects on lipid rafts would also reverse functional impairment. We used methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), a nonspecific cholesterol acceptor well-known for its capacity to disrupt lipid rafts. Treatment with 0.25 mm of MβCD for 60 min, a condition previously reported as sufficient to disrupt rafts without causing toxic effects on cells (31Zidovetzki R. Levitan I. Use of cyclodextrins to manipulate plasma membrane cholesterol content: evidence, misconceptions and control strategies.Biochim. Biophys.

However, the specific target downstream of the TGFβ receptor involved in the noncanonical signaling is unknown. Here, we show that TGFβ increased the catalytic loop phosphorylation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ), a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed abundantly in glomerular mesangial cells. TGFβ increased phosphorylation of the PI 3-kinase–interacting Tyr-751 residue of PDGFRβ, thus activating Akt. Inhibition of PDGFRβ using a pharmacological inhibitor and siRNAs blocked TGFβ-stimulated phosphorylation of proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40), an intrinsic inhibitory component of mTORC1, and prevented activation of mTORC1 in the absence of any effect on Smad 2/3 phosphorylation. Expression of constitutively active myristoylated Akt reversed the siPDGFRβ-mediated inhibition of mTORC1 activity; however, co-expression of the phospho-deficient mutant of PRAS40 inhibited the effect of myristoylated Akt, suggesting a definitive role of PRAS40 phosphorylation in mTORC1 activation downstream of PDGFRβ in mesangial cells. Additionally, we demonstrate that PDGFRβ-initiated phosphorylation of PRAS40 is required for TGFβ-induced mesangial cell hypertrophy and fibronectin and collagen I (α2) production. Increased activating phosphorylation of PDGFRβ is also associated with enhanced TGFβ expression and mTORC1 activation in the kidney cortex and glomeruli of diabetic mice and rats, respectively. Thus, pursuing TGFβ noncanonical signaling, we identified how TGFβ receptor I achieves mTORC1 activation through PDGFRβ-mediated Akt/PRAS40 phosphorylation to spur mesangial cell hypertrophy and matrix protein accumulation.

Chronic kidney disease affects 10% of the world's population, including 20 million Americans, and causes increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and loss of renal function, leading to end-stage renal disease with significant public health costs (1Collins A.J.

Thus, understanding the progression of the disease process is of prime importance for its prevention and arrest. The pathologic correlates of progressive renal function impairment include renal structural changes with initial renal hypertrophy, especially glomerular hypertrophy, that leads to hyperfiltration and microalbuminuria, followed by accumulation of matrix proteins and a greater degree of proteinuria (3Vega G.

A significant pathologic characteristic of chronic kidney disease is glomerulosclerosis. One-third of the cell population in the glomerulus is made up of mesangial cells, which have the capacity to communicate with the endothelial cells; they can also regulate glomerular filtration because of their contractile nature (5Abboud H.E. Mesangial cell biology.Exp. Cell Res. 2012; 318 (22414873): 979-98510.1016/j.yexcr.2012.02.025Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 6Schlondorff D.

In the disease milieu or in vitro when mesangial cells are exposed to TGFβ, they undergo hypertrophy and acquire a myofibroblast-like phenotype to synthesize larger amounts of matrix proteins (9Kagami S.

The dimeric active TGFβ directly binds to TGFβ receptor II, which is a constitutively active kinase. After TGFβ binding, TGFβRI is recruited into the complex and undergoes phosphorylation by TGFβRII. Activated TGFβRI then binds and phosphorylates the receptor-specific Smad, Smad 2, and Smad 3, which form a complex with a common Smad, Smad 4, for translocation to the nucleus and regulation of gene transcription (13Moustakas A.

Apart from this canonical signaling, TGFβ also initiates other noncanonical signal transduction pathways involving mitogen-activated protein kinases, PI 3-kinase/Akt/mTORC1, and Rho GTPase, which contribute to the renal complications under disease conditions (13Moustakas A.

Among many hormones, growth factors, and cytokines, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) contributes to significant injury in different renal, especially glomerular, diseases (5Abboud H.E. Mesangial cell biology.Exp. Cell Res. 2012; 318 (22414873): 979-98510.1016/j.yexcr.2012.02.025Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Four different isoforms of PDGF (A, B, C, and D) form a total of five homo- or heterodimers (18Fredriksson L. Li H. Eriksson U. The PDGF family: four gene products form five dimeric isoforms.Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15 (15207811): 197-20410.1016/j.cytogfr.2004.03.007Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). These dimers bind to three dimeric PDGF receptors (PDGFRs), αα, ββ, and αβ, with variable affinity (19Boor P. Ostendorf T. Floege J. PDGF and the progression of renal disease.Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2014; 29 (24493869): i45-i5410.1093/ndt/gft273Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For example, whereas PDGF AA and CC show affinity for PDGFRα, CC also binds to PDGFRαβ. PDGF DD binds to PDGFRαβ at a low affinity, but it interacts with PDGFRββ with significantly higher affinity. On the other hand, PDGF AB and BB bind to both receptors. All these PDGF dimers and three dimeric receptors are expressed in mesangial cells (19Boor P. Ostendorf T. Floege J. PDGF and the progression of renal disease.Nephrol. Dial.

In fibrotic disorders such as diabetic nephropathy where TGFβ contributes to the pathology, expression of PDGF BB and PDGFRβ is increased, especially in mesangial cells (25Langham R.G. Kelly D.J.

Whether PDGFRβ contributes to the signal transduction of TGFβ in mesangial cell pathology through a cross-talk has not been investigated. In our studies, we show that TGFβ activates PDGFRβ to initiate Akt signaling to inactivate PRAS40, which results in the increased mTORC1 activity necessary for mesangial cell hypertrophy and expression of matrix proteins fibronectin and collagen I (α2). Previously, we demonstrated that TGFβ increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, including a protein at 190 kDa to induce noncanonical signaling in mesangial cells (15Ghosh Choudhury G. Abboud H.E. Tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent PI 3 kinase/Akt signal transduction regulates TGFβ-induced fibronectin expression in mesangial cells.Cell Signal. 2004; 16 (14607273): 31-4110.1016/S0898-6568(03)00094-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To characterize the tyrosine kinase involved in the action of TGFβ, we considered PDGFRβ because it is a receptor tyrosine kinase, it is one of most abundant receptors expressed in mesangial cells, and it elicits pathology in glomerulosclerosis (5Abboud H.E. Mesangial cell biology.Exp. Cell Res. 2012; 318 (22414873): 979-98510.1016/j.yexcr.2012.02.025Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 19Boor P. Ostendorf T. Floege J.

Because activation of PDGFRβ requires its phosphorylation at Tyr-857 in the activation loop, we examined this in glomerular mesangial cells. TGFβ increased the phosphorylation of PDGFRβ in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Because TGFβ utilizes its type I serine/threonine kinase receptor for its signal transduction, we used a specific TGFβRI inhibitor, SB-431542 (SB), to test its involvement in PDGFRβ phosphorylation. Similar to the effect on phosphorylation of Smad 2 and Smad 3, SB significantly inhibited TGFβ-stimulated PDGFRβ Tyr-857 phosphorylation (Fig. 1, B–D). PDGFRβ undergoes autophosphorylation at this site (13Moustakas A. Heldin C.H. The regulation of TGFβ signal transduction.Development. 2009; 136 (19855013): 3699-371410.1242/dev.030338Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used a specific PDGFRβ ATP competitive inhibitor, JNJ-10198409 (JNJ), in mesangial cells. JNJ blocked the autophosphorylation of PDGFRβ in response to TGFβ (Fig. 1E). Importantly, JNJ did not have any effect on phosphorylation of Smad 2 and Smad 3 in response to TGFβ (Fig. 1, F and G). Similarly, siRNAs against PDGFRβ to block its expression (Fig. 1H) showed no effect on TGFβ-induced phosphorylation of Smad 2 and Smad 3 (Fig. 1, I and J). These data indicate that TGFβ activates PDGFRβ; however, PDGFRβ does not control the canonical Smad 2/3 phosphorylation by TGFβRI. We and others demonstrated previously that TGFβ regulates PI 3-kinase–dependent Akt activation (15Ghosh Choudhury G. Abboud H.E. Tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent PI 3 kinase/Akt signal transduction regulates TGFβ-induced fibronectin expression in mesangial cells.Cell Signal. 2004; 16 (14607273): 31-4110.1016/S0898-6568(03)00094-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28Bakin A.V.

For activation of PI 3-kinase, the SH2 domain of the lipid kinase has to interact with the tyrosine phosphorylated proteins (30McGlade C.J. Ellis C. Reedijk M. Anderson D. Mbamalu G. Reith A.D. Panayotou G. End P. Bernstein A. Kazlauskas A. SH2 domains of the p85 α subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulate binding to growth factor receptors.Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12 (1372092): 991-99710.1128/mcb.12.3.991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of activated PDGFRβ, PI 3-kinase associates with the phosphorylated Tyr-751 (31Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Phospholipase C-γ 1 and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase are the downstream mediators of the PDGF receptor's mitogenic signal.Cell. 1993; 73 (7682895): 321-33410.1016/0092-8674(93)90232-FAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined the phosphorylation of PDGFRβ at this site in mesangial cells. TGFβ increased the phosphorylation of PDGFRβ at Tyr-751 in a time-dependent manner similar to its catalytic loop Tyr-857 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). Both TGFβRI and PDGFRβ inhibitors SB and JNJ significantly blocked the phosphorylation of PDGFRβ at Tyr-751 (Fig. 2, B and C). Activation of PI 3-kinase results in the phosphorylation of its downstream target Akt at the catalytic loop Thr-308 and hydrophobic motif Ser-473 sites (32Manning B.D. Toker A. AKT/PKB signaling: navigating the network.Cell. 2017; 169 (28431241): 381-40510.1016/j.cell.2017.04.001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine the activation of PI 3-kinase, we measured the phosphorylation of these Akt residues. TGFβ increased the phosphorylation of both these residues in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). JNJ significantly inhibited the TGFβ-induced phosphorylation of Akt at both of these sites (Fig. 2E). Because phosphorylation of Akt increases its kinase activity, we determined the phosphorylation of one of its endogenous substrates, glycogen synthase kinase 3-β (GSK3β). JNJ significantly inhibited GSK3β phosphorylation by TGFβ (Fig. 2F). To confirm this observation, we used siRNAs to down-regulate PDGFRβ in mesangial cells. siRNAs against PDGFRβ inhibited the TGFβ-induced phosphorylation of Akt and its endogenous substrate GSK3β (Fig. 2, G and H). We and others demonstrated that TGFβ regulates mTORC1 activity (14Das F. Ghosh-Choudhury N. Mahimainathan L. Venkatesan B. Feliers D. Riley D.J. Kasinath B.S. Choudhury G.G.

The exclusive mTORC1 subunit PRAS40 acts as an inhibitor of mTORC1 activity (34Sancak Y. Thoreen C.C. Peterson T.R. Lindquist R.A. Kang S.A. Spooner E. Carr S.A. Sabatini D.M. PRAS40 is an insulin-regulated inhibitor of the mTORC1 protein kinase.Mol.

Similarly, the GTPase-activating protein tuberin inhibits mTORC1 by acting on the Rheb GTPase (35Inoki K. Li Y. Xu T. Guan K.L.

When phosphorylated by Akt, both of these proteins undergo inactivation (36Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. TSC2 is phosphorylated and inhibited by Akt and suppresses mTOR signalling.Nat.

We determined the effect of PDGFRβ inhibition on the phosphorylation of these proteins. JNJ significantly inhibited the TGFβ-stimulated phosphorylation of PRAS40 and tuberin (Fig. 3, A and B). Similarly, PDGFRβ siRNAs blocked phosphorylation of PRAS40 and tuberin in response to TGFβ (Fig. 3, C and D). Because phosphorylation/inactivation of PRAS40 and tuberin activate mTORC1, we determined activity of the latter by using phosphorylation of its substrates S6 kinase and 4EBP1. We also examined the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (rps6), which undergoes phosphorylation upon S6 kinase activation. TGFβ increased the phosphorylation of S6 kinase and 4EBP1 at mTORC1 sites and rps6 at S6 kinase sites. Both JNJ and siPDGFRβ markedly inhibited phosphorylation at these sites by TGFβ (Fig. 3, E–J). Along with Akt/mTORC1, TGFβ also increases phosphorylation/activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and STAT3 (39Heldin C.H. Moustakas A. Signaling receptors for TGF-β family members.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8 (27481709): a02205310.1101/cshperspect.a022053Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 40Xu S. Mao Y. Wu J.

TGFβ increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and STAT3 with similar kinetics (Fig. 4, A and B) as autophosphorylation of PDGFRβ (Fig. 1A). We examined whether activation of PDGFRβ is necessary for ERK1/2 and STAT3 phosphorylation. Interestingly, incubation of mesangial cells with JNJ did not have any effect on TGFβ-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and STAT3 (Fig. 4, C and D). Similarly, siRNAs against PDGFRβ did not inhibit phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and STAT3 in response to TGFβ (Fig. 4, E and F). These results indicate that PDGFRβ is involved in TGFβ-induced Akt/mTORC1 activation but not in the regulation of ERK1/2 and STAT3. Our results above demonstrate that TGFβ activates PDGFRβ. To determine the mechanism of activation of PDGFRβ, we considered the expression of the PDGFRβ ligand PDGF B, which forms BB homodimer to activate the receptor (41Bruna A. Darken R.S. Rojo F.

TGFβ time-dependently increased the expression of PDGF B in mesangial cells (Fig. 5A). These results indicate that a TGFβ-induced increase in PDGF expression may regulate PDGFRβ activation. We tested this hypothesis. We used siRNAs against PDGF B. siPDGF B inhibited TGFβ-stimulated phosphorylation of PDGFRβ (Fig. 5B). Also, TGFβ-induced phosphorylation of Akt was inhibited by siRNAs against PDGF B (Fig. 5C). These data conclusively demonstrate that PDGF B regulates the activation of PDGFRβ and the downstream activation of Akt/mTORC1 by TGFβ. We tested this notion by using PDGF BB ligand directly in mesangial cells. PDGF BB increased the phosphorylation of PDGFRβ in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 6A) similar to the kinetics of PDGF B expression by TGFβ (Fig. 5A). Also, PDGF BB enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 6B), resulting in phosphorylation of PRAS40 and tuberin (Fig. 6, C and D), which led to the activation of mTORC1 as judged by phosphorylation of S6 kinase, rps6, and 4EBP1 (Fig. 6, E–G). Furthermore, increased phosphorylation of PDGFRβ was observed when PDGF BB ligand was added as compared with TGFβ alone (Fig. S1A). No further increase in phosphorylation was found when both ligands were added (Fig. S1A). Importantly, this increased PDGFRβ phosphorylation resulted in a similar increase in Akt phosphorylation leading to mTORC1 activation (Fig. S1, B–G). Similar to the observations with TGFβ, PDGFRβ inhibitor JNJ blocked PDGF BB–stimulated phosphorylation of Akt, PRAS40, and tuberin (Fig. S2, A–C). JNJ also blocked activation of mTORC1 in response to PDGF BB (Fig. S2, D–F).Figure 6PDGF increases activating phosphorylation of PDGFRβ leading to Akt/mTORC1 activity.

Despite the well-characterized role for LYCAT in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, its involvement in lung cancer, if any, remains incompletely understood. In this study, in silico analysis of TCGA lung cancer data sets revealed a significant increase in LYCAT expression, which was later corroborated in human lung cancer tissues and immortalized lung cancer cell lines via indirect immunofluorescence and immunoblotting, respectively. Stable knockdown of LYCAT in NSCLC cell lines not only reduced CL and increased monolyso-CL levels but also reduced in vivo tumor growth, as determined by xenograft studies in athymic nude mice. Furthermore, blocking LYCAT activity using a LYCAT mimetic peptide attenuated cell migration, suggesting a novel role for LYCAT activity in promoting NSCLC. Mechanistically, the pro-proliferative effects of LYCAT were mediated by an increase in mitochondrial fusion and a G1/S cell cycle transition, both of which are linked to increased cell proliferation. Taken together, these results demonstrate a novel role for LYCAT in promoting NSCLC and suggest that targeting LYCAT expression or activity in NSCLC may provide new avenues for the therapeutic treatment of lung cancer.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States, and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for ∼85% of all lung cancers with a 5-year survival of only ∼16% (1Herbst R.S. Heymach J.V. Lippman S.M. Lung cancer.N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 359 (18815398): 1367-138010.1056/NEJMra0802714Crossref PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar, 2Jemal A. Siegel R. Ward E. Hao Y. Xu J.

Overall, the toll of lung cancer deaths in the United States exceeds that of the next four major cancers combined (1Herbst R.S. Heymach J.V. Lippman S.M. Lung cancer.N. Engl. J.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new technologies and biomarkers for early detection as well as to identify new targets for therapy. Emerging evidence suggests a key role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the development and progression of lung cancer (3Santucci R. Sinibaldi F. Polticelli F. Fiorucci L. Role of cardiolipin in mitochondrial diseases and apoptosis.Curr. Med. Chem. 2014; 21 (24735357): 2702-271410.2174/0929867321666140414112156Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 4Lennon F.E.

Cardiolipin (CL), or 1,3-diphosphatidyl-sn-glycerol, is an anionic phospholipid that is synthesized exclusively in the mitochondria and predominantly localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane (5Buckland A.G. Kinkaid A.R. Wilton D.C. Cardiolipin hydrolysis by human phospholipases A2: the multiple enzymatic activities of human cytosolic phospholipase A2.Biochim. Biophys.

CL plays an important role for optimal mitochondrial function, including electron transport, mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial biogenesis, apoptotic machinery, and vascular development. Deficiencies in CL content and modification in linoleic acid molecular species are associated with dysfunctional heart in diabetes, heart failure and ischemia-reperfusion injury, and Barth syndrome (6Houtkooper R.H.

However, very little is known about the role of CL and its modifying enzyme, LYCAT, in lung cancer. In this study, mining the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) gene expression data sets revealed a significant up-regulation of LYCAT in human non-small-cell lung cancers, which was later corroborated in human lung tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, knockdown of LYCAT expression attenuated NSCLC proliferation and cell migration in vitro and subcutaneous tumor growth in vivo. Transcriptional profiling of LYCAT knockdown cells revealed several genes that regulate the G1/S cell cycle transition. Moreover, LYCAT knockdown resulted in a significant decrease in mitochondrial fragmentation. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel role for LYCAT in promoting lung tumor growth via altered mitochondrial dynamics. Therefore, targeting LYCAT expression and/or activity might represent a novel therapeutic strategy to treat lung cancer. As a first step to evaluate a role for LYCAT in lung cancer, we examined the expression levels of LYCAT in TCGA lung cancer data sets. LYCAT expression was significantly up-regulated in the lung tumors when compared with normal lungs in both lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) data sets (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, to determine the correlation of LYCAT expression with overall patient survival, we performed Kaplan–Meier survival analysis by using KM Plotter (11Schneider C.A. Rasband W.S. Eliceiri K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 (22930834): 671-67510.1038/nmeth.2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (35376) Google Scholar). For these studies, 274 low- and 186 high-LYCAT–expressing patient samples from TCGA, which are separated by their median values, were employed. Increased expression of LYCAT was correlated with poor overall patient survival in LUAD, but not in LUSC, data sets (Fig. 1B). We next investigated whether LYCAT gene expression correlates with known drivers of lung cancer by using cBIOPortal for Cancer Genomics (RRID:SCR_014555). Of the seven frequently observed somatic gene alterations (EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), KRAS, ERBB2, ALK, TP53, BRAF, and RET (rearranged during transfection)), increased expression of LYCAT positively correlated with KRAS, ERBB2, and BRAF and negatively correlated with ALK (Fig. 1C). To further examine LYCAT expression in human lung cancer, we assessed the expression of LYCAT in both formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues samples and fresh-frozen lung tumor tissue samples. Lung tumors have a significant increase in LYCAT expression compared with adjacent uninvolved lung tissues as determined by immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 1D) and immunoblotting (Fig. 1E). There was no significant staining with IgG-only controls, indicating the specificity of anti-LYCAT antibody (Fig. 1D). Moreover, increased LYCAT expression was also observed in the lung tumors of urethane-treated mice (Fig. 1F). Urethane is a chemical carcinogen and a KRAS mutagen that induces lung tumors (12Keith R.L. Karoor V. Mozer A.B. Hudish T.M. Le M. Miller Y.E. Chemoprevention of murine lung cancer by gefitinib in combination with prostacyclin synthase overexpression.Lung Cancer. 2010; 70 (20116128): 37-4210.1016/j.lungcan.2010.01.004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 13To M.D. Rosario R.D.

Finally, the expression of LYCAT was analyzed in cell lysates of human bronchial epithelial cells and a panel of NSCLC cell lines (Fig. 1G). In agreement with the lung cancer tissue data, LYCAT expression was significantly increased in 70% of NSCLC cell lines (Fig. 1G). Collectively, these data demonstrate an enhanced expression of LYCAT in human lung tumors, NSCLC cells, and in the lungs of urethane-treated mice compared with normal lungs. Having determined an increased expression of LYCAT in lung cancer, we next sought to determine the role of LYCAT in driving cell proliferation. For these studies, we designed small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against LYCAT. Because LYCAT protein expression is up-regulated in lung cancer, we chose to evaluate the effects of LYCAT knockdown on cell proliferation in NSCLC cells (e.g. H2122 and H23 cells that express high amounts of LYCAT) (Fig. 1G). We generated and tested multiple stable clones with stable expression of nontargeting control shRNA and LYCAT targeting shRNA. H2122 clone (Fig. 2A) and H23 (Fig. 2D) clone with stable expression of LYCAT shRNA showed significant knockdown of LYCAT. Knockdown of LYCAT in two NSCLC cell lines resulted in a significant reduction in cell proliferation as determined by MTT (Fig. 2, B and E) and clonogenic (Fig. 2, C and F) cell proliferation assays. To exclude the possible off-target effects of LYCAT shRNA, we performed rescue experiments. For these studies, we employed adenoviruses that encode mouse LYCAT cDNAs. mLycat adenoviral transduction of H23 clones with stable expression of LYCAT shRNAs resulted in an increase in cell proliferation when compared with control adenovirus-treated H23 clone with stable LYCAT knockdown (Fig. 2G, compare lanes 1, 3, and 4). To determine the effects of LYCAT knockdown on NSCLC proliferation, we also employed CRISPR-Cas9–mediated gene editing of LYCAT in NSCLC cell lines: H2122 (Fig. 2, H–J) and H23 (Fig. 2, K–M). For generating LYCAT knockdown cell lines, H2122 and H23 cells were transfected with a pool of guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting LYCAT followed by clonal isolation via cell sorting. H2122 and H23 LYCAT knockout clones displayed significant reduction in LYCAT protein expression (Fig. 2, H and K) and cell proliferation compared with their respective parental cells, as evaluated by cell growth curves (Fig. 2, I and L) and clonogenic cell proliferation assays (Fig. 2, J and M). We speculate that the incomplete LYCAT gene knockout in H2122 and H23 cells might be due to the cell ploidy and the efficiency of LYCAT sgRNAs to knock out all the copies of LYCAT in NSCLC cells. Taken together, these data establish an important role for LYCAT in driving cell proliferation. To test the effects of LYCAT knockdown on cell migration, we performed wound-healing assays (scratch assay). In these assays, a 3-mm scrape wound was created on confluent cultures of H2122 (Fig. 3A) and H23 (Fig. 3C) clones stably expressing LYCAT shRNA. After 24 h, the abilities of the cells to heal the wound were recorded in the presence of a mitosis blocker, Mitomycin C. H2122 and H23 clones with LYCAT knockdown showed reduced cell motility when compared with H2122 and H23 clones with control shRNA (Fig. 3, A and C). The migratory potential of H2122 and H23 LYCAT knockdown clones was also assessed by using transwell assays (Fig. 3, B and D). In these assays, cells were seeded into transwell inserts and allowed to migrate toward 10% serum-containing medium through a permeable membrane (8 μm). The migrated cells on the bottom of the insert were later fixed, stained with crystal violet, and counted, and they are represented in the graphs (Fig. 3, B and D). LYCAT knockdown resulted in reduced cell migration in both H2122 (Fig. 3B) and H23 (Fig. 3D) clones. Consistent with shRNA-mediated LYCAT knockdown, CRISPR-Cas9–mediated gene editing of LYCAT also resulted in reduced cell migration in both H2122 (Fig. 3E) and H23 (Fig. 3F) clones. We have also evaluated the invasive capabilities of LYCAT knockdown clones by employing transwell inserts coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences). The cells that invaded Matrigel and migrated through the 8-μm pores were later stained and counted. When compared with parental cells, LYCAT knockdown showed reduced invasive capabilities in both H2122 (Fig. 3G) and H23 (Fig. 3H) cells. We also evaluated the effects of LYCAT knockdown on apoptosis. Annexin V–FITC staining of parental and LYCAT gene–edited cells showed no significant changes in the percentages of annexin V–FITC/propidium iodide–positive cells in both H2122 and H23 cell lines (Fig. 3I). To evaluate the effects of LYCAT knockdown on tumor growth in vivo, we subcutaneously injected H2122 clones stably expressing LYCAT shRNA into the lateral flanks of athymic nude mice. After 8 weeks, all the mice injected with H2122 cells stably expressing control shRNA developed tumors at the injection site (Fig. 3, J and K), whereas mice injected with H2122 clones stably expressing LYCAT shRNA failed to develop tumors (Fig. 3, J and K). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that increased LYCAT expression is an important contributor of lung tumor development. Because LYCAT is involved in the dynamic remodeling of CL in mitochondria and membranes of mammalian cells (15Huang L.S. Jiang P. Feghali-Bostwick C. Reddy S.P. Garcia J.G.N. Natarajan V.

LC–MS analysis of the molecular species of CL from control and shRNA LYCAT H23 cells revealed a major CL cluster between m/z 1349 and 1499 (Fig. 4A). A significant decrease in 11 molecular species of CL was observed in H23 cells stably expressing LYCAT shRNA (Fig. 4, B and C). Fragmentation analysis further revealed a decrease in 18:1/18:1/18:2/18:0 species in H23 cells stably expressing LYCAT shRNA (Fig. 4D). Hydrolysis of CLs by phospholipases (e.g. iPLA2 localized in the mitochondria or cPLA2) results in the generation of monolysocardiolipin (MCL; Fig. 4E). Interestingly, 50:4 and 44:3 molecular species of MCL were significantly increased in H23 cells stably expressing LYCAT shRNA when compared with control shRNA cells (Fig. 4, F and G). In total, depletion of LYCAT in NSCLC cells resulted in a decrease in CL levels and a corresponding increase in MCL levels. It is known that LYCAT activity is required for the dynamic remodeling of CL in mitochondria and membranes of mammalian cells (15Huang L.S. Jiang P. Feghali-Bostwick C. Reddy S.P. Garcia J.G.N. Natarajan V. Lysocardiolipin acyltransferase regulates TGF-β mediated lung fibroblast differentiation.Free Radic. Biol.

To determine whether the biological effects of LYCAT on NSCLC were dependent on its activity, we developed peptide mimetics of LYCAT based on a unique sequence within LYCAT, which can bind to MCL (Fig. 5A). We believe that the peptide when added to cells competes with LYCAT for MCL, thereby preventing the formation of cardiolipin (Fig. 5A). For these studies, both the scrambled control peptide (VTSISADTHK) and peptide mimetic of 10 amino acids were tagged to HIV TAT sequence (YGRKKRRQRRR) for cell penetration. Later, these peptides were employed in in vitro LYCAT activity assays to evaluate the effects of LYCAT mimetic peptide in blocking LYCAT activity. In these assays, H2122 cells were preincubated either with control peptide or LYCAT mimetic peptide (30 μm) for 3 h, followed by incubation of cell lysates (200 µg of protein) with or without MCL (5 μm) and 25 μm 16-E8 NBD-16:0 fatty acyl-CoA, as described under “Experimental procedures.” Following incubation, the lipids were extracted under acidic conditions and dried under a nitrogen stream, and the fluorescence-labeled CL formed from exogenously added MCL and NBD-16:0 fatty acyl-CoA was separated by TLC and quantified by a GE ImageQuant LAS4000 analyzer and quantified by ImageJ (11Schneider C.A. Rasband W.S. Eliceiri K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 (22930834): 671-67510.1038/nmeth.2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (35376) Google Scholar). Preincubation of cells with the LYCAT mimetic peptide reduced the ability of cell lysates to generate fluorescence-labeled CL, showing the ability of the mimetic peptide to penetrate inside the cell and inhibit LYCAT activity (Fig. 5B). To determine the biological effects of LYCAT activity inhibition, we assessed the effects of the LYCAT peptide mimetic on cell culture assays that evaluate cell migration. For these assays, we selected H2122 NSCLC cell lines, as they exhibited high LYCAT expression. Treatment of H2122 cells with the LYCAT peptide mimetic (30 μm) resulted in a significant reduction in cell motility (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that LYCAT activity is essential for the serum-induced cell migration of NSCLC cells in vitro. To determine the mechanism by which LYCAT contributes to lung tumor development, we analyzed the mRNA expression profiles of H2122 cells stably expressing either control or LYCAT shRNA. For these studies, RNA was isolated from a single clone at three different passages (n = 3, biological replicates). LYCAT knockdown in these cells was shown previously (Fig. 2A). The RNA-Seq analysis identified several differentially expressed (DE) genes. Further gene ontology and KEGG pathway analyses of the DE gene list using the DAVID database (17Huang D.W. Sherman B.T. Tan Q. Collins J.R. Alvord W.G. Roayaei J. Stephens R. Baseler M.W. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A.

Of the 11 categories, it was interesting to note that the most significant pathway of DE genes was the p53 signaling pathway (Fig. 6A). Fifteen key genes were classified under the p53 signaling pathway, of which the top down-regulated (CCND2) and up-regulated (CDKN1A) genes upon LYCAT knockdown were selected for further validation (Fig. 6B). Probing the cell lysates of H2122 NSCLC cells stably expressing either control shRNA or LYCAT shRNA showed a significant up-regulation of CDKN1A and a significant down-regulation of CCND2, validating the RNA-Seq data (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, because CDKN1A and CCND2 are critical regulators of the cell cycle (19Badia R. Pujantell M. Riveira-Muñoz E. Puig T. Torres-Torronteras J. Martí R. Clotet B. Ampudia R.M. Vives-Pi M. Este J.A. Ballana E. The G1/S specific cyclin D2 is a regulator of HIV-1 restriction in non-proliferating cells.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12 (27541004): e100582910.1371/journal.ppat.1005829Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we also evaluated whether knockdown of LYCAT impacts cell cycle distribution. For these studies, H2122 and H23 clones stably expressing control or LYCAT shRNA were utilized in flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle distribution with propidium iodide DNA staining dye. LYCAT shRNA knockdown in H2122 and H23 resulted in a decrease in the percentage of cells in S phase (Fig. 6, D and E) and a corresponding increase in G2/M phase (Fig. 6, D and E), indicating that LYCAT knockdown arrests NSCLC cells in G2/M. In total, these results demonstrate that LYCAT may affect G1/S transition during lung tumorigenesis. Mitochondria quickly adapt to the increasing energy demands by interchanging their architecture (mitochondrial dynamics) between a highly fused, tubular state (i.e. fusion) and a more fragmented perinuclear form (i.e. fission) (20Tilokani L. Nagashima S. Paupe V. Prudent J. Mitochondrial dynamics: overview of molecular mechanisms.Essays Biochem. 2018; 62 (30030364): 341-36010.1042/EBC20170104Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Because LYCAT is one of the two major cardiolipin-remodeling enzymes that is critical for the normal function of the mitochondria (16Huang L.S. Mathew B. Li H. Zhao Y. Ma S.F. Noth I. Reddy S.P. Harijith A. Usatyuk P.V. Berdyshev E.V. Kaminski N. Zhou T. Zhang W. Zhang Y.

Bilyy R. Mitochondrial dynamics during cell cycling.Apoptosis. 2016; 21 (27658785): 1327-133510.1007/s10495-016-1295-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), we explored next the role of LYCAT in regulating mitochondrial dynamics in NSCLC. For these studies, H2122 (Fig. 7A) and H23 (Fig. 7B) cells with stable expression of either control or LYCAT shRNA were stained with MitoTracker Red, followed by confocal microscopy. LYCAT knockdown resulted in a significant decrease in mitochondrial fragmentation in both H2122 (Fig. 7A) and H23 (Fig. 7B) cells when compared with their corresponding control shRNA–transfected cells. Restoration of LYCAT expression in H23 cells stably expressing LYCAT shRNAs by way of adenoviral infection reversed the effects of LYCAT knockdown on mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig. 7C). In strong agreement with the MitoTracker studies, probing the cell lysates with dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), which drives mitochondrial fission (22Song M. Mihara K. Chen Y. Scorrano L. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Mitochondrial fission and fusion factors reciprocally orchestrate mitophagic culling in mouse hearts and cultured fibroblasts.Cell Metab. 2015; 21 (25600785): 273-28610.1016/j.cmet.2014.12.011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), showed an increase in DRP1 expression upon LYCAT knockdown (Fig. 7D). Furthermore, an increase in mitofusin1 (MFN1) and mitofusin2 (MFN2), which control mitochondrial outer membrane fusion (22Song M. Mihara K. Chen Y. Scorrano L. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Mitochondrial fission and fusion factors reciprocally orchestrate mitophagic culling in mouse hearts and cultured fibroblasts.Cell Metab. 2015; 21 (25600785): 273-28610.1016/j.cmet.2014.12.011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), was also observed upon LYCAT knockdown (Fig. 7D). Consistent with the shRNA-mediated LYCAT knockdown (Fig. 7, A–C), CRISPR-Cas9–mediated LYCAT gene editing also resulted in increased mitochondrial fusion (Fig. 7, E and F). Complementary studies employing LYCAT overexpression in Beas2B cells showed reduced mitochondrial fusion, as determined by MitoTracker staining (Fig. 7G) and markers of mitochondrial fusion/fission (Fig. 7H). These results demonstrate an important role for LYCAT in regulating mitochondrial dynamics in NSCLC. CL, or 1,3-diphosphatidyl-sn-glycerol, is an anionic phospholipid that is biosynthesized exclusively in the mitochondria and predominantly localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane (5Buckland A.G. Kinkaid A.R. Wilton D.C. Cardiolipin hydrolysis by human phospholipases A2: the multiple enzymatic activities of human cytosolic phospholipase A2.Biochim. Biophys.

CL has four long-chain fatty acids, and the fatty acyl chain composition depends on the cell type. In heart mitochondria, the predominant molecular species of CL are tetralinoleoyl and trilinoleoyl-oleoyl species; however, the newly synthesized immature CL has more monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids. The fatty acyl chains of CL undergo rapid remodeling in the mitochondria to generate a linoleic acid–rich molecular species, which is catalyzed by tafazzin and LYCAT. Tafazzin, encoded by the TAZ gene, is highly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle (6Houtkooper R.H. Turkenburg M. Poll-The B.T. Karall D. Pérez-Cerdá C. Morrone A. Malvagia S. Wanders R.J.

https://openalex.org/W3046853141,"Background Combination therapy in the treatment of sepsis, especially the value of combining a β-Lactam antibiotic with an aminoglycoside, has been discussed. This retrospective cohort study including patients with sepsis or septic shock aimed to investigate whether one single dose of gentamicin at admittance (SGA) added to β-Lactam antibiotic could result in a lower risk of mortality than β-Lactam monotherapy, without exposing the patient to the risk of nephrotoxicity. Methods and findings All patients with positive blood cultures were evaluated for participation (n = 1318). After retrospective medical chart review, a group of patients with community-acquired sepsis with positive blood cultures who received β-Lactam antibiotic with or without the addition of SGA (n = 399) were included for the analysis. Mean age was 74.6 yrs. (range 19–98) with 216 (54%) males. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA score) median was 3 (interquartile range [IQR] 2–5) and the median Charlson Comorbidity Index for the whole group was 2 (IQR 1–3). Sixty-seven (67) patients (17%) had septic shock. The 28-day mortality in the combination therapy group was 10% (20 of 197) and in the monotherapy group 22% (45 of 202), adjusted HR 3.5 (95% CI (1.9–6.2), p = < 0.001. No significant difference in incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) was detected. Conclusion This retrospective observational study including patients with community-acquired sepsis or septic shock and positive blood cultures, who meet Sepsis-3 criteria, shows that the addition of one single dose of gentamicin to β-lactam treatment at admittance was associated with a decreased risk of mortality and was not associated with AKI. This antibiotic regime may be an alternative to broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment of community-acquired sepsis. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these results."
https://openalex.org/W3046129978,"During autophagy, LC3 and GABARAP proteins become covalently attached to phosphatidylethanolamine on the growing autophagosome. This attachment is also reversible. Deconjugation (or delipidation) involves the proteolytic cleavage of an isopeptide bond between LC3 or GABARAP and the phosphatidylethanolamine headgroup. This cleavage is carried about by the ATG4 family of proteases (ATG4A, B, C, and D). Many studies have established that ATG4B is the most active of these proteases and is sufficient for autophagy progression in simple cells. Here we examined the second most active protease, ATG4A, to map out key regulatory motifs on the protein and to establish its activity in cells. We utilized fully in vitro reconstitution systems in which we controlled the attachment of LC3/GABARAP members and discovered a role for a C-terminal LC3-interacting region on ATG4A in regulating its access to LC3/GABARAP. We then used a gene-edited cell line in which all four ATG4 proteases have been knocked out to establish that ATG4A is insufficient to support autophagy and is unable to support GABARAP proteins removal from the membrane. As a result, GABARAP proteins accumulate on membranes other than mature autophagosomes. These results suggest that to support efficient production and consumption of autophagosomes, additional factors are essential including possibly ATG4B itself or one of its proteolytic products in the LC3 family.

Atg8, LC3B, and GABARAP proteins are initially expressed in a pro-form that is not competent for conjugation.

This initial cleavage event is known as priming.

Atg8/LC3B/GABARAP-PE stays bound to the autophagosome membrane through its formation but must be removed just prior to or concomitantly with fusion of the autophagosome into the lysosome or vacuole. The removal of external Atg8/LC3B/GABARAP from PE is also performed by Atg4/ATG4-mediated proteolysis, in a process known as delipidation (18Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y.

Defects in delipidation of Atg8–PE by Atg4 prevents recycling of Atg8 off membranes, which both limits the available pool for future rounds of autophagy and prevents fusion of the autophagosome and the lysosome (27Yu Z.

Thus, ATG4 family proteins act constitutively to prime newly expressed Atg8/LC3B/GABARAP proteins but also must function under temporal and spatial regulation to release lipid-conjugated forms of Atg8/LC3/GABARAP from fully formed mature autophagosomes. We and others have begun to study how priming and delipidation are independently regulated to achieve these drastically different kinetics in the cell (29Kauffman K.J. Yu S. Jin J. Mugo B. Nguyen N.

KO of ATG4B, but not of the other three mammalian ATG4 proteases, eliminates priming of all LC3 proteins and dramatically impairs priming of the GABARAP family proteins (29Kauffman K.J. Yu S. Jin J.

Delipidation of mammalian Atg8-family proteins by each of the four ATG4 proteases.Autophagy. 2018; 14 (29458288): 992-101010.1080/15548627.2018.1437341PubMed Google Scholar, 30Agrotis A. Pengo N.

Delipidation is more complicated. Our laboratory has established that although ATG4A, ATG4C, and ATG4D are very poor at priming, consistent with many previous studies, they are surprisingly just as efficient as ATG4B in vitro at delipidation (29Kauffman K.J. Yu S. Jin J. Mugo B. Nguyen N. O'Brien A. Nag S. Lystad A.H. Melia T.J. Delipidation of mammalian Atg8-family proteins by each of the four ATG4 proteases.Autophagy. 2018; 14 (29458288): 992-101010.1080/15548627.2018.1437341PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that they play a key role in deciding when and which LC3 or GABARAP proteins are released from the membrane. Thus far, however, the study of ATG4A, ATG4C, and ATG4D function in cells has largely been confounded by the redundancy of the family. In particular, how and whether ATG4A-mediated priming and delipidation are independently controlled has not been known. Here, we explore the limits of ATG4A-mediated delipidation in a gene-edited cell line we created in which all four mammalian ATG4 genes are missing, which allows us to specifically rescue with ATG4A and various engineered mutants. We discover that like ATG4B, the C-terminal LC3-interaction region (LIR) of ATG4A is essential to its function, but unlike ATG4B, this motif controls both priming and delipidation on ATG4A. Furthermore, we show that ATG4A is not sufficient to support autophagy in our cell lines and, more surprisingly, does not appear to support any delipidation of its substrate, GABARAPL1 (from now on referred to as GL1), in this context. We show that instead, GL1 accumulates on a variety of membranes and remains membrane-associated even if the normal cues for activating the lipidation pathway are shut off for as long as 24 h. This strongly implies that ATG4A does not have access to GL1–PE (also known as GL1-II) under these conditions, suggesting more complex intracellular regulation of its delipidation activity. The redundancy of function across the ATG4 family limits the useful interpretation of single knockouts, and thus we have created a gene-edited HEK293 cell line that we call our ATG4 quadruple knockout (ATG4QKO). In this cell line, there is no detectable expression of any of the ATG4 proteins by Western blotting (Fig. S1A and Ref. 29Kauffman K.J. Yu S. Jin J. Mugo B. Nguyen N. O'Brien A. Nag S. Lystad A.H. Melia T.J. Delipidation of mammalian Atg8-family proteins by each of the four ATG4 proteases.Autophagy. 2018; 14 (29458288): 992-101010.1080/15548627.2018.1437341PubMed Google Scholar), and we have confirmed genetic alteration at each locus (Fig. S1B). Without any ATG4 expression, these cells are completely incapable of priming the ATG8 protein family, and thus all lipidation of the ATG8 proteins is also inhibited (29Kauffman K.J. Yu S. Jin J. Mugo B. Nguyen N. O'Brien A. Nag S. Lystad A.H. Melia T.J. Delipidation of mammalian Atg8-family proteins by each of the four ATG4 proteases.Autophagy. 2018; 14 (29458288): 992-101010.1080/15548627.2018.1437341PubMed Google Scholar). We previously showed that re-expression of ATG4B in this background is sufficient to rescue LC3 and GABARAP protein priming and lipidation and even to support flux of these proteins in a bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1)–dependent way, suggesting restoration of autophagy (29Kauffman K.J. Yu S. Jin J. Mugo B. Nguyen N. O'Brien A. Nag S. Lystad A.H. Melia T.J. Delipidation of mammalian Atg8-family proteins by each of the four ATG4 proteases.Autophagy. 2018; 14 (29458288): 992-101010.1080/15548627.2018.1437341PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, re-expression of ATG4A is unable to rescue LC3 processing, consistent with many previous publications, and also leads to anomalous processing of GABARAP proteins. In particular, these cells continue to have a large pool of unprimed pro-GL1 and accumulate fully lipidated GL1-II to high levels but do not show any significant levels of free-floating processed GL1 (GL1-I) (Ref. 29Kauffman K.J. Yu S. Jin J. Mugo B. Nguyen N. O'Brien A. Nag S. Lystad A.H. Melia T.J. Delipidation of mammalian Atg8-family proteins by each of the four ATG4 proteases.Autophagy. 2018; 14 (29458288): 992-101010.1080/15548627.2018.1437341PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. S2). This result suggests that ATG4A can prime a portion of the GABARAP family protein pool, and this entire population of primed GL1-I is utilized for lipidation. Should any delipidation take place, newly released protein is again rapidly lipidated. Thus, we have an opportunity to consider how autophagy progresses when only the GABARAP family is able to become lipid-attached and to assess how ATG4A contributes to this process. Recent papers have suggested that the GABARAPs can be fully sufficient for at least some forms of macroautophagy and that even in the absence of all LC3 and GABARAP proteins, some macroautophagy persists (32Nguyen T.N. Padman B.S. Usher J. Oorschot V. Ramm G. Lazarou M.

Therefore, we first established whether the delivery of cargo is possible in our ATG4QKO cells, where no primed LC3 or GABARAP is available to be lipidated. To look at starvation-mediated turnover of bulk cytoplasm, we used a long-lived protein degradation (LLPD) assay in which cells are incubated in media supplemented with [14C]valine and then chased with medium supplemented with cold valine. These cells were then incubated in either normal or nutrient-reduced (EBSS) medium for 4 h to look for starvation-dependent changes in bulk protein turnover. Consistent with previous results (35Choy A. Dancourt J. Mugo B. O'Connor T.J. Isberg R.R. Melia T.J. Roy C.R. The Legionella effector RavZ inhibits host autophagy through irreversible Atg8 deconjugation.Science. 2012; 338 (23112293): 1072-107710.1126/science.1227026Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 36Lystad A.H.

Critically, when these cells were treated with the PI3K inhibitor 3-MA to block initiation of the macroautophagy pathway, starvation-dependent LLPD is mostly prevented. In contrast to WT cells, ATG4QKO cells were incapable of starvation-dependent LLPD. Thus, starvation-dependent flux depends on ATG4 proteins in this cell line. Lentiviral-mediated rescue of individual ATG4A, B, C, or D genes in the ATG4QKO restored ATG8 protein family processing to varying degrees (29Kauffman K.J. Yu S. Jin J. Mugo B. Nguyen N. O'Brien A. Nag S. Lystad A.H. Melia T.J. Delipidation of mammalian Atg8-family proteins by each of the four ATG4 proteases.Autophagy. 2018; 14 (29458288): 992-101010.1080/15548627.2018.1437341PubMed Google Scholar). We observed in these rescues that high expression of ATG4A drove significant lipidation of GL1, whereas re-expression of ATG4C or ATG4D resulted in more modest levels of lipidated GABARAP family proteins, and only ATG4B re-expression restored any LC3 processing (Fig. S2). To establish whether the ATG4A-, ATG4C-, or ATG4D-mediated processing of GABARAP proteins alone can drive full autophagy, we looked at LLPD in these lines. Surprisingly, only ATG4B re-expression was sufficient to support a starvation-mediated LLPD and did so at essentially WT levels. Cells expressing only ATG4A, ATG4C, or ATG4D behaved exactly like the ATG4QKO (Fig. 1A). Thus, bulk cargo delivery depends absolutely on the presence of ATG4B, consistent with other reports (36Lystad A.H. Carlsson S.R. Ballina L.R. De Kauffman K.J. Nag S. Yoshimori T. Melia T.J.

To look at how a specific autophagic cargo is handled, we followed levels of the adaptor proteins p62/SQSTM1 and NBR1 and a potential autophagic cargo lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) across various cellular stress conditions. Neither NBR1 nor LDH levels depended upon ATG4 expression, and neither changed in response to small molecule treatments in WT HEK293 cells (Fig. S3) and so were not further examined. We also could not detect changes in p62 levels in WT cells following starvation, even when the lysosomal inhibitor Baf A1 was included to accumulate lysosome-directed proteins (Fig. 1B and Fig. S4). Note that the levels of LC3B-II did increase in both Baf A1 and starvation conditions, indicating that only p62 flux in these cells was undetectable. As expected, there was also no flux of p62 (or of pro-LC3) in our ATG4QKO cells. Interestingly, however, overall p62 levels were elevated ∼2-fold higher in ATG4QKO cells relative to WT cells (Fig. 1B), indicating that loss of the ATG4 family alters the overall homeostasis of p62 (29Kauffman K.J. Yu S. Jin J. Mugo B. Nguyen N. O'Brien A. Nag S. Lystad A.H. Melia T.J. Delipidation of mammalian Atg8-family proteins by each of the four ATG4 proteases.Autophagy. 2018; 14 (29458288): 992-101010.1080/15548627.2018.1437341PubMed Google Scholar). Re-expression of ATG4B in the ATG4QKO but not re-expression of ATG4A, C, or D restored p62 to levels similar to WT (Fig. 1C and Figs. S2 and S4). Thus, ATG4B is able to restore essentially normal processing of the LC3 and GABARAP families, fully support LLPD, and maintain normal p62 homeostasis, whereas expression of any other ATG4 alone can prime GABARAP protein families (to varying levels) but cannot otherwise support autophagy. Some studies have observed that in cells depleted of LC3, the GABARAP family is sufficient to drive autophagosome formation and even cargo delivery (32Nguyen T.N. Padman B.S. Usher J. Oorschot V. Ramm G. Lazarou M. Atg8 family LC3/GABARAP proteins are crucial for autophagosome–lysosome fusion but not autophagosome formation during PINK1/Parkin mitophagy and starvation.J.

Thus, in principle, the ATG4QKO-ATG4A cell line that primes GABARAP, GL1, and GL2 and accumulates lipidated forms of all three proteins might also support macroautophagy. However, the absence of both starvation-mediated LLPD and normal p62 homeostasis indicates that instead there are unexpected detriments to autophagy. To that end, we suspected that the strong accumulation of GL1-II in cells expressing only ATG4A (Fig. S2) reflected a breakdown in the normal GL1 cycle in cells that might underlie a larger problem with autophagosome progression (Fig. 2A, cartoon). In particular, the complete absence of GL1-I could arise because the total pool of primed LC3 and GABARAP proteins is very small, and thus all free GL1-I formed from either priming or from delipidation becomes immediately relipidated. Alternatively, GL1-I depletion could indicate a general failure of ATG4A to support delipidation in these cells. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we reasoned that by blocking autophagosome biogenesis signals that generally drive lipidation, we might uncouple the two processes and measure delipidation rates. We treated cells with wortmannin, a potent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor that blocks autophagy initiation. In the absence of PI3P, the activation of autophagy in general and of the lipidation machinery in particular is largely inhibited. For example, although WT cells incubated in Baf A1 accumulate significant LC3-II and less but detect"
https://openalex.org/W3045742757,"Single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses assemble their replication complexes in infected cells from a multidomain replication polyprotein. This polyprotein usually contains at least one protease, the primary function of which is to process the polyprotein into mature proteins. Such proteases also may have other functions in the replication cycle. For instance, cysteine proteases (PRO) frequently double up as ubiquitin hydrolases (DUB), thus interfering with cellular processes critical for virus replication. We previously reported the crystal structures of such a PRO/DUB from Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) and of its complex with one of its PRO substrates. Here we report the crystal structure of TYMV PRO/DUB in complex with ubiquitin. We find that PRO/DUB recognizes ubiquitin in an unorthodox way: It interacts with the body of ubiquitin through a split recognition motif engaging both the major and the secondary recognition patches of ubiquitin (Ile44 patch and Ile36 patch, respectively, including Leu8, which is part of the two patches). However, the contacts are suboptimal on both sides. Introducing a single-point mutation in TYMV PRO/DUB aimed at improving ubiquitin-binding led to a much more active DUB. Comparison with other PRO/DUBs from other viral families, particularly coronaviruses, suggests that low DUB activities of viral PRO/DUBs may generally be fine-tuned features of interaction with host factors. Single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses assemble their replication complexes in infected cells from a multidomain replication polyprotein. This polyprotein usually contains at least one protease, the primary function of which is to process the polyprotein into mature proteins. Such proteases also may have other functions in the replication cycle. For instance, cysteine proteases (PRO) frequently double up as ubiquitin hydrolases (DUB), thus interfering with cellular processes critical for virus replication. We previously reported the crystal structures of such a PRO/DUB from Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) and of its complex with one of its PRO substrates. Here we report the crystal structure of TYMV PRO/DUB in complex with ubiquitin. We find that PRO/DUB recognizes ubiquitin in an unorthodox way: It interacts with the body of ubiquitin through a split recognition motif engaging both the major and the secondary recognition patches of ubiquitin (Ile44 patch and Ile36 patch, respectively, including Leu8, which is part of the two patches). However, the contacts are suboptimal on both sides. Introducing a single-point mutation in TYMV PRO/DUB aimed at improving ubiquitin-binding led to a much more active DUB. Comparison with other PRO/DUBs from other viral families, particularly coronaviruses, suggests that low DUB activities of viral PRO/DUBs may generally be fine-tuned features of interaction with host factors. Host–pathogen relationships are complex. The outcome of pathogen infection depends on a subtle balance between host immune responses triggered by infection and pathogen replication aimed at promoting propagation. In recent years, ubiquitination and deubiquitination events have emerged as central processes in antiviral mechanisms and viral multiplication (1Alcaide-Loridan C. Jupin I.

Ubiquitination is the conjugation of ubiquitin (Ub), a highly conserved 76-residue protein, to a target protein, through the formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine residue of Ub to a Lys of the target protein (6Komander D. Rape M. The ubiquitin code.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81 (22524316): 203-22910.1146/annurev-biochem-060310-170328Crossref PubMed Scopus (2247) Google Scholar). Targets of ubiquitination are cellular proteins mostly involved in host immune responses and/or viral proteins (4Luo H. Interplay between the virus and the ubiquitin-proteasome system: molecular mechanism of viral pathogenesis.Curr. Opin. Virol. 2016; 17 (26426962): 1-1010.1016/j.coviro.2015.09.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In certain cases, ubiquitin-like modifiers such as SUMO, NEDD8, or Ub-like ISG15 (interferon-simulated gene 15) may also be covalently attached to various substrates (7Komander D. Clague M.J. Urbé S. Breaking the chains: structure and function of the deubiquitinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 550-56310.1038/nrm2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). Substrates are often polyubiquitinated, i.e. a chain of multiple Ub moieties, each linked by an isopeptide bond, is formed. Depending on the linkage type between distal and proximal Ub, the fate of tagged proteins varies, from targeting to proteasome or other degradation pathways for degradation (8Clague M.J. Urbé S. Ubiquitin: same molecule, different degradation pathways.Cell. 2010; 143 (21111229): 682-68510.1016/j.cell.2010.11.012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) to nonproteolytic events such as interaction with various partners (6Komander D. Rape M. The ubiquitin code.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81 (22524316): 203-22910.1146/annurev-biochem-060310-170328Crossref PubMed Scopus (2247) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination is a reversible process. Deubiquitination is catalyzed by deubiquitinases (DUBs), which can cleave isopeptide bonds to either trim, degrade, or edit polyUb chains from substrate proteins (7Komander D. Clague M.J. Urbé S. Breaking the chains: structure and function of the deubiquitinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 550-56310.1038/nrm2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). Because viruses strictly depend on the host to replicate and spread, they have evolved to circumvent or even hijack for their own advantage the ubiquitin-dependent responses triggered by entry of virus into the cell and subsequent replication (4Luo H. Interplay between the virus and the ubiquitin-proteasome system: molecular mechanism of viral pathogenesis.Curr. Opin.

Indeed, a number of viruses have evolved DUBs (11Bailey-Elkin B.A. Knaap R.C.M. Kikkert M. Mark B.L. Structure and function of viral deubiquitinating enzymes.J. Mol. Biol. 2017; 429 (28625850): 3441-347010.1016/j.jmb.2017.06.010Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Wimmer P. Schreiner S.

The targets of viral DUBs can be cellular and/or viral proteins (11Bailey-Elkin B.A. Knaap R.C.M. Kikkert M. Mark B.L. Structure and function of viral deubiquitinating enzymes.J. Mol. Biol. 2017; 429 (28625850): 3441-347010.1016/j.jmb.2017.06.010Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As an example, deubiquitination of cellular proteins by viral DUBs can down-regulate the production of diverse antiviral molecules such as interferons or cytokines and allow viruses to evade host immune responses (12Wimmer P. Schreiner S. Viral mimicry to usurp ubiquitin and SUMO host pathways.Viruses. 2015; 7 (26343706): 4854-487210.3390/v7092849Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 13Zhao C. Collins M.N.

Another example is the deubiquitination of viral proteins by viral DUBs that avoids their targeting to the proteasome, a process that can be viewed as a rescue of these viral proteins. For some viruses an excess of certain viral proteins can be detrimental for viral replication (14Camborde L. Planchais S. Tournier V. Jakubiec A. Drugeon G. Lacassagne E. Pflieger S. Chenon M. Jupin I. The ubiquitin-proteasome system regulates the accumulation of Turnip yellow mosaic virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase during viral infection.Plant Cell. 2010; 22 (20823192): 3142-315210.1105/tpc.109.072090Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Kerkvliet J.

These viruses use the deubiquitination step to modulate proteasome-dependent degradation to subtly control the level of the relevant proteins (9Choi A.G. Wong J. Marchant D. Luo H.

For instance, adjusting the amount of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) may regulate the replication of some RNA viruses such as Sindbis virus (16de Groot R.J. Rümenapf T. Kuhn R.J. Strauss E.G.

DUBs are cysteine proteases or metalloproteases and are classified into seven families including two new families that have been recently defined (7Komander D. Clague M.J. Urbé S.

These enzymes can specifically cleave one or several Ub linkage types or display a more general deubiquitinating activity. DUBs encoded by some single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses ((+)ssRNA viruses) such as arteriviruses, coronaviruses, picornaviruses, and tymoviruses are actually bifunctional enzymes also responsible for the viral polyprotein maturation through a protease (PRO) activity that cleaves defined peptide bonds (22Barretto N.

The dual PRO/DUB enzyme encoded by TYMV is a valuable example to address these questions because it is known to tightly regulate the level of RdRp during viral replication (24Chenon M. Camborde L. Cheminant S. Jupin I. A viral deubiquitylating enzyme targets viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and affects viral infectivity.EMBO J. 2012; 31 (22117220): 741-75310.1038/emboj.2011.424Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28Jupin I.

TYMV encodes an essential 206-kDa replicative polyprotein called 206K, which contains sequence domains indicative of methyltransferase (MT), PRO, NTPase/helicase (HEL), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (POL or RdRp) activities. The TYMV PRO domain first cleaves 206K to give rise to an intermediate product called 140K (encompassing the MT, PRO, and HEL domains) and the protein 66K (POL), after which it cleaves the 140K intermediate to release proteins called 98K (MT-PRO) and 42K (HEL) (29Bransom K.L.

The 66K polymerase is subject to phosphorylation and ubiquitination events triggered by the host, which ultimately target the modified protein to the proteasome where it is degraded (14Camborde L.

Because of its DUB activity, the PRO domain of TYMV can counteract such degradation and inhibit 66K degradation (24Chenon M. Camborde L. Cheminant S. Jupin I.

Although TYMV 66K is likely to be tagged with Lys48-linked polyUb chains and TYMV PRO/DUB is able to process in vitro Lys48- and Lys63-linked polyUb chain (24Chenon M. Camborde L. Cheminant S.

In addition, how TYMV PRO/DUB recognizes ubiquitinated 66K is unknown. The structure of TYMV PRO/DUB (34Lombardi C. Ayach M. Beaurepaire L. Chenon M. Andreani J. Guerois R. Jupin I. Bressanelli S.

Clague M.J. Urbé S. Breaking the chains: structure and function of the deubiquitinases.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Strikingly, Tymoviridae PRO/DUBs are the only OTU DUBs that lack two elements of the canonical cysteine protease active site displayed by all other OTU DUBs. First, it has only a catalytic dyad (composed of Cys783 and His869) instead of the typical (Cys-His-Asp/Asn) triad of OTU DUBs. The Asp/Asn residue is replaced by a serine (Ser871 in TYMV PRO/DUB) that is conserved in the other members of the Tymoviridae family (34Lombardi C. Ayach M. Beaurepaire L. Chenon M. Andreani J. Guerois R. Jupin I. Bressanelli S.

Second, there is no pocket that could constitute the oxyanion hole that is formed during the catalytic mechanism (34Lombardi C. Ayach M. Beaurepaire L. Chenon M. Andreani J. Guerois R. Jupin I. Bressanelli S.

In contrast, Tymoviridae PRO/DUBs display a unique loop (Gly865-Pro866-Pro867) in close vicinity of the active site (34Lombardi C. Ayach M. Beaurepaire L. Chenon M. Andreani J. Guerois R. Jupin I. Bressanelli S.

We previously concluded that this loop is involved in substrate recognition and contributes to align the side chains of catalytic residues (28Jupin I. Ayach M. Jomat L. Fieulaine S. Bressanelli S.

The mobility of this loop therefore would contribute to switching from the PRO activity to the DUB activity. In one of the TYMV PRO/DUB crystal structures, the protein has adventitiously self-assembled into the active form (35Robin C. Beaurepaire L. Chenon M. Jupin I. Bressanelli S.

To better understand the DUB function of the TYMV PRO/DUB domain, we report its crystal structure in complex with ubiquitin. We supplemented the low resolution of the structure (3.7 Å) with molecular dynamics simulations. We used this modeling approach to further probe the differences in molecular recognition between two of its substrates, i.e. PRO of the PRO↓HEL cleavage site and ubiquitin. A structure-guided mutagenesis study identified point mutants with an increased DUB activity, showing that the unusual recognition of Ub by TYMV PRO/DUB is suboptimal. Comparison of this PRO/DUB–Ub structure with that of the PRO/DUB·PRO complex that occurs during polyprotein processing (34Lombardi C. Ayach M. Beaurepaire L. Chenon M. Andreani J. Guerois R. Jupin I.

TYMV PRO/DUB and Ub-VME were incubated at 25 °C, leading to the formation of a covalent complex as evidenced by SDS-PAGE (Fig. S1A), which was then purified by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. S1B). Crystals of the protein complex grew in a single drop after 120 days. Only a single crystal showed acceptable diffraction that allowed us to collect data. The structure was solved at 3.7 Å resolution by molecular replacement. The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains two PRO/DUB–Ub complexes, one of which is well-ordered and could be modeled with confidence, except in a few places where density was ambiguous. We complemented this crystallographic model with molecular dynamics simulations that helped to resolve ambiguities and allowed an accurate view of the complex (see below for details). The second complex in the asymmetric unit was modeled from the first and the structure refined with tight noncrystallographic restraints with good statistics (Table 1).

https://openalex.org/W3046853450,"There is a critical need to improve trauma-informed services in structurally marginalized communities impacted by violence and its associated traumatic grief. For community residents, particularly gang-associated youth, repeated exposure to traumatic grief causes serious adverse effects that may include negative health outcomes, delinquency, and future violent offenses. The recent proliferation of digital social media platforms, such as Twitter, provide a novel and largely underutilized resource for responding to these issues, particularly among these difficult-to-reach communities. In this paper, we explore the potential for using a human-machine partnered approach, wherein qualitative fieldwork and domain expertise is combined with a computational linguistic analysis of Twitter content among 18 gang territories/neighborhoods on Chicago's South Side. We first employ in-depth interviews and observations to identify common patterns by which residents in gang territories/neighborhoods express traumatic grief on social media. We leverage these qualitative findings, supplemented by domain expertise and computational techniques, to gather both traumatic grief- and gang-related tweets from Twitter. We next utilize supervised machine learning to construct a binary classification algorithm to eliminate irrelevant tweets that may have been gathered by our automated query and extraction techniques. Last, we confirm the validity, or ground truth, of our computational findings by enlisting additional domain expertise and further qualitative analyses of the specific traumatic events discussed in our sample of Twitter content. Using this approach, we find that social media provides useful signals for identifying moments of increased collective traumatic grief among residents in gang territories/neighborhoods. This is the first study to leverage Twitter to systematically ground the collective online articulations of traumatic grief in traumatic offline events occurring in violence-impacted communities. The results of this study will be useful for developing more effective tools-including trauma-informed intervention applications-for community organizations, violence prevention initiatives, and other public health efforts."

Though the study area has been implementing standardized Health Management Information System (HMIS), there was a need for information on how well structures were utilizing information and this study was designed to assess HMIS data utilization. Methods Facility based retrospective study was conducted in Southern Nations Nationalities and People’s Region (SNNPR) in April, 2017. We included data from 163 sample facilities. Data use was evaluated by reviewing eight items from performance monitoring system that included activities from problem identification to monitoring of proposed action plans. Each item reviewed was recoded to yes or no and summed to judge overall performance. Results About half (52%) of woredas, 26.2% health centers (HCs), 25% hospitals and 6.2% health posts (HPs) reviewed their performance monthly but only 20% woredas, 6.2% HCs, 1.5% HPs and no hospital prepared action plans after reviewing performance. Summary of 8 items assessed showed that majority of facilities (87.5% hospitals, 81.5% HPs and 70.8% HCs) were poor in data utilization. Conclusions Only about half of woredas and below one-fifth of health facilities were utilizing HMIS data and a lot to move to catch-up country’s information revolution plan. Lower health care systems should be supported in evidence-based decision-making and progress should be monitored routinely quantitatively and/or qualitatively."
https://openalex.org/W3046764369,"Background Increased attention is being paid to the relationship between the immune status of the tumor microenvironment and tumor prognosis. The application of immune scoring in evaluating the clinical prognosis of liver cancer patients has not yet been explored. This study sought to clarify the association between immune score and prognosis and construct a clinical nomogram to predict the survival of patients with liver cancer. Methods A total of 346 patients were included in our analysis datasets downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. A Cox proportional-hazards regression model was used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs). A nomogram was built based on the results of multivariate analysis and was subjected to bootstrap internal validation. The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability were measured by the concordance index (C-index) and the calibration curve. Through the functional analysis of differential expression of genes with different immune scores, the target genes were screened out. Results In comparison with patients with low immune scores, those with intermediate and high immune scores had significantly improved survival time [HR and 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.54 (0.30–0.97) and 0.51 (0.27–0.97), respectively]. The C-index for survival time prediction was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.60–0.71). The calibration plot for the probability of survival at three or five years showed good agreement between prediction by the nomogram and actual observations. The top 10 hub genes were CXCL8(chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8), SYK(spleen tyrosine kinase), CXCL12(chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12), CXCL10 (chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand10), CXCL1(chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand1), CCL5(chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5), CCL20(chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20), LCK, CXCL11(chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 11), CCR5(chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5). More importantly, we found that the high expression of CXCL8 and CXCL1 were related to the prognosis. Conclusions High and/or intermediate immune scores are significantly correlated with better survival time in patients with liver cancer. Moreover, nomograms for predicting prognosis may help to estimate the survival of patients. We also propose that CXCL8 and CXCL1 may be a potential therapeutic target for liver cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3046296856,"Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), exhibit antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. Furthermore, diets rich in n-3 PUFAs are known to improve disease resistance and limit pathogen infection in commercial aquaculture fishes. In this study, we examined the effects of transgenic overexpression of n-3 PUFA biosynthesis genes on the physiological response to bacterial infection in tilapia. We first established tilapia strains with single or dual expression of salmon delta-5 desaturase and/or delta-6 desaturase and then challenged the fish with Vibrio vulnificus infection. Interestingly, our data suggest that n-3 PUFA-mediated alterations in gut microbiota may be important in determining disease outcome via effects on immune response of the host. Both liver- and muscle-specific single and dual expression of delta-5 desaturase and delta-6 desaturase resulted in higher n-3 PUFA content in transgenic fish fed with a LO basal diet. The enrichment of n-3 PUFAs in dual-transgenic fish is likely responsible for their improved survival rate and comparatively reduced expression of inflammation- and immune-associated genes after V. vulnificus infection. Gut microbiome analysis further revealed that dual-transgenic tilapia had high gut microbiota diversity, with low levels of inflammation-associated microbiota (i.e., Prevotellaceae). Thus, our findings indicate that dual expression of transgenic delta-5 and delta-6 desaturase in tilapia enhances disease resistance, an effect that is associated with increased levels of n-3 PUFAs and altered gut microbiota composition."
https://openalex.org/W3046613781,"Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a widely used trait in angiosperms caused by perturbations in nucleus-mitochondrion interactions that suppress the production of functional pollen. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that act as regulatory molecules of transcriptional or post-transcriptional gene silencing in plants. The discovery of miRNAs and their possible implications in CMS induction provides clues for the intricacies and complexity of this phenomenon. Previously, we characterized an Ogura-CMS line of turnip (Brassica rapa ssp. rapifera) that displays distinct impaired anther development with defective microspore production and premature tapetum degeneration. In the present study, high-throughput sequencing was employed for a genome-wide investigation of miRNAs. Six small RNA libraries of inflorescences collected from the Ogura-CMS line and its maintainer fertile (MF) line of turnip were constructed. A total of 120 pre-miRNAs corresponding to 89 mature miRNAs were identified, including 87 conversed miRNAs and 33 novel miRNAs. Among these miRNAs, the expression of 10 differentially expressed mature miRNAs originating from 12 pre-miRNAs was shown to have changed by more than two-fold between inflorescences of the Ogura-CMS line and inflorescences of the MF line, including 8 down- and 2 up-regulated miRNAs. The expression profiles of the differentially expressed miRNAs were confirmed by stem-loop quantitative real-time PCR. In addition, to identify the targets of the identified miRNAs, a degradome analysis was performed. A total of 22 targets of 25 miRNAs and 17 targets of 28 miRNAs were identified as being involved in the reproductive development for Ogura-CMS and MF lines of turnip, respectively. Negative correlations of expression patterns between partial miRNAs and their targets were detected. Some of these identified targets, such as squamosa promoter-binding-like transcription factor family proteins, auxin response factors and pentatricopeptide repeat-containing proteins, were previously reported to be involved in reproductive development in plants. Taken together, our results can help improve the understanding of miRNA-mediated regulatory pathways that might be involved in CMS occurrence in turnip."
https://openalex.org/W3046615640,"Cyanobacteria can form biofilms in nature, which have ecological roles and high potential for practical applications. In order to study them we need biofilm models that contain healthy cells and can withstand physical manipulations needed for structural studies. At present, combined studies on the structural and physiological features of axenic cyanobacterial biofilms are limited, mostly due to the shortage of suitable model systems. Here, we present a simple method to establish biofilms using the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC6803 under standard laboratory conditions to be directly used for photosynthetic activity measurements and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We found that glass microfiber filters (GMF) with somewhat coarse surface features provided a suitable skeleton to form Synechocystis PCC6803 biofilms. Being very fragile, untreated GMFs were unable to withstand the processing steps needed for SEM. Therefore, we used polyhydroxybutyrate coating to stabilize the filters. We found that up to five coats resulted in GMF stabilization and made possible to obtain high resolution SEM images of the structure of the surface-attached cells and the extensive exopolysaccharide and pili network, which are essential features of biofilm formation. By using pulse-amplitude modulated variable chlorophyll fluorescence imaging, it was also demonstrated that the biofilms contain photosynthetically active cells. Therefore, the Synechocystis PCC6803 biofilms formed on coated GMFs can be used for both structural and functional investigations. The model presented here is easy to replicate and has a potential for high-throughput studies."
https://openalex.org/W3046918919,"Red turpentine beetle, Dendroctonus valens (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) is a non-aggressive pine bark beetle native to North America, and more aggressive invader in China. Dispersing pioneer beetles are attracted to potential host trees by oleoresin monoterpene kairomones, but respond more strongly to those combined with ethanol, a mixture often released from stressed, dying, or recently dead trees. (+)-3-Carene, usually the dominant or co-dominant monoterpene in ponderosa pine, Pinus ponderosa, is a stronger attractant than α-pinene or β-pinene where tested over a large portion of the D. valens range, while (+)-3-carene+ethanol was shown previously to attract twice the beetles of (+)-3-carene. A field test comparing D. valens attraction among the three monoterpenes when all are released with ethanol has never been reported, and was our objective. In three US Pacific Northwestern pine forests, (–)-β-pinene+ethanol lures attracted 1.4 to 1.9 times more beetles than (+)-3-carene+ethanol. (+)- or (±)-α-pinene+ethanol lures were least attractive. A 1:1:1 monoterpene mixture+ethanol lure attracted more beetles than the 1:1:1 lure, but it was not statistically higher. Monoterpenes were dispensed from low density polyethylene bottles and their release rates monitored in laboratory and field tests. Under laboratory conditions (+)-3-carene was released much more rapidly than (+)-α-pinene or (–)-β-pinene when dispensed separately, or in a 1:1:1 mixture. (+)-3-Carene in the 1:1:1 mixture increased the release of both pinenes over their rates when dispensed separately. (–)-β-Pinene+ethanol is currently the strongest kairomone lure for D. valens attraction in US northwest pine forests, and has value for beetle detection, monitoring, research, and management."
https://openalex.org/W3046346734,"Mitogenic signals that regulate cell division often proceed through multienzyme assemblies within defined intracellular compartments. The anchoring protein Gravin restricts the action of mitotic kinases and cell-cycle effectors to defined mitotic structures. In this report we discover that genetic deletion of Gravin disrupts proper accumulation and asymmetric distribution of γ-tubulin during mitosis. We utilize a new precision pharmacology tool, Local Kinase Inhibition, to inhibit the Gravin binding partner polo-like kinase 1 at spindle poles. Using a combination of gene-editing approaches, quantitative imaging, and biochemical assays, we provide evidence that disruption of local polo-like kinase 1 signaling underlies the γ-tubulin distribution defects observed with Gravin loss. Our study uncovers a new role for Gravin in coordinating γ-tubulin recruitment during mitosis and illuminates the mechanism by which signaling enzymes regulate this process at a distinct subcellular location."
https://openalex.org/W3046404709,"Background Topical cocaine is favoured by many surgeons for sinonasal surgery due to its superior vasoconstrictive and anesthetic properties. However, historical reports suggesting cocaine is associated with an increased risk of cardiac events have led many surgeons to turn to alternative topical medications. The objective of this study was to determine whether cocaine use during sinonasal surgery is associated with an increased risk of perioperative cardiac events and death. Methods We conducted a population-based analysis of patients undergoing sinonasal surgery from 2009–2016 using linked administrative health care data sets in Ontario, Canada. We compared patients treated at institutions that primarily use topical cocaine (exposed group) to those treated at institutions that do not use cocaine (unexposed group). Our primary outcome was a composite of major cardiac events or all-cause mortality within 48 hours of surgery. Due to low event rates, the outcome was compared using a Fisher’s exact test. Results Of 10,549 patients who were included in the study, 27.4% were treated at an institution that uses topical cocaine. The rate of the composite of perioperative major cardiac event or all-cause mortality within 48 hours of surgery in the exposed and unexposed groups was, ≤0.2% and 0 (p-value>0.05), respectively. Conclusions In this large real-world cohort of patients undergoing sinonasal surgery, there does not appear to be any significant increased risk of morbidity or mortality associated with cocaine use. These findings have important implications for surgeons performing this procedure."
https://openalex.org/W3046230883,"This study assesses the degree of internationalization of Chinese firms along the Belt and Road initiative countries. Most of the extant studies of the Belt and Road initiative have been qualitative, and where there have been quantitative studies, they have usually been at the aggregate level, and only a handful have used firm-level data to study initiative. Using a composite measure of the degree of internationalization, DOIBRI, that composed of variables capturing the performance, structural and attitudinal dimensions of internationalization, comparative analysis of State-owned enterprises and privately owned enterprises turned up counter-intuitive results. Firstly, given that state ownership could be positively associated with the degree of internationalization of firms and because of the significance of the Belt and Road initiative, we expected the State-owned enterprises to dominate the DOIBRIrankings. We assessed the firms, and contrary to expectations, privately owned firms had a higher average degree of internationalization. Furthermore, we expected both state-owned enterprises and privately-owned enterprises to have similar levels of psychic dispersion. However, state-owned enterprises were more psychically dispersed. Suggesting that along the belt and road countries, the advantages of state ownership of Chinese multinationals may be attenuated."
https://openalex.org/W3046426480,"Using pooled DNA genotyping to estimate the proportional contributions from multiple families in a pooled sample is of particular interest for selective breeding in aquaculture. We compared different pooled libraries with separate 2b-RAD sequencing of Litopenaeus vannamei individuals to assess the effect of different population structures (different numbers of individuals and families) on pooled DNA sequencing, the accuracy of parent sequencing of the DNA pools and the effect of SNP numbers on pooled DNA sequencing. We demonstrated that small pooled DNA genotyping of up to 53 individuals by 2b-RAD sequencing could provide a highly accurate assessment of population allele frequencies. The accuracy increased as the number of individuals and families increased. The allele frequencies of the parents from each pool were highly correlated with those of the pools or the corresponding individuals in the pool. We chose 500-28,000 SNPs to test the effect of SNP number on the accuracy of pooled sequencing, and no linear relationship was found between them. When the SNP number was fixed, increasing the number of individuals in the mixed pool resulted in higher accuracy of each pooled genotyping. Our data confirmed that pooled DNA genotyping by 2b-RAD sequencing could achieve higher accuracy than that of individual-based genotyping. The results will provide important information for shrimp breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W3046459057,"Background Gastrostomy tubes (G-tubes) are typically used when people cannot eat food by mouth. The connector section that allows G-tubes to connect to other devices, such as feeding sets or syringes, has been modified on some of the devices to reduce misconnections in hospital settings. The narrow internal diameter of the new connector, standardized under ISO 80369–3, has caused some users to express concern about a reduced flow rate. Previous studies performed on commercial devices determined that it was not conclusive how much the ISO 80369–3 connector contributed towards the reduced flow rate, because when manufacturers designed these new connector-based devices, they often changed other geometric variables (such as distal tube diameter, or length) at the same time. Thus, it became difficult isolating the effect of the connector from other geometric variables. Method The key objective of this study was to investigate how different design variables impacted the flow rate through the G-tubes. 3D-printed devices were used to assess the geometric parameters in a systematic manner. Commercial diets and Newtonian analog fluids with matched viscosities were used for testing. Results The flow path length of the “transition section” encompassing the standardized ISO 80369–3 connector in the new devices was found to cause reduced flow. Additionally, results showed that a shortened (≤ 10 mm) transition section, along with a 10% increase in the distal inner diameter of large bore devices (e.g., 24 Fr), can restore flow rates to levels consistent with the previous devices prior to the connector standardization. Conclusions The strategy for restoring flow rates to previous levels may help alleviate concerns raised by multiple stakeholders such as health care professionals, patients, caregivers and device manufacturers. In addition, the approach proposed here can be used as a tool for designing future G-tube devices."
https://openalex.org/W3046544074,"The Great-billed Seed-finch (Sporophila maximiliani) is an endangered South American bird that has suffered from trafficking and the destruction of its natural habitat. In contrast, there are over 180,000 Great-billed Seed-finches legally raised in captivity in Brazil. The interest as a pet for Great-billed Seed-finches is due to their exceptional ability to sing. In the present research, the unknown genetic structure of the Great-billed Seed-finch captive population was investigated by quantitative analysis of 6,226 pedigree records. Additionally, 7,671 phenotypic records were available to estimate genetic parameters such as heritability and evolvability of a song-related trait of these birds for competitions. The captive Great-billed Seed-Finch population faces many of the problems commonly encountered in domestic animal populations such as a high level of inbreeding (average of 8.26%, 70.47% of birds were inbred), pedigree bottlenecks, unbalanced contribution of breeding animals and structuring (equivalent number of subpopulations of 2.91). Despite this, most genetic diversity remains preserved within aviaries. The high generation interval (5.74 years) found for this population should help to prevent a rapid increase in inbreeding and genetic drift. These results should serve as strong motivation and support for urgent actions to manage the genetic diversity of captive Great-billed Seed-Finches. From the viewpoint of genetic improvement for singing time in tournaments (STT), this trait presents sufficient variability to allow response to artificial selection given the heritability of 18.7% and evolvability of 2,447%. In contrast, inbreeding and high generation interval appear to be the most considerable barriers that may limit the genetic gain for STT. Widespread adoption of techniques such as optimal genetic contribution selection and implementation of routine genetic diversity monitoring via pedigree analysis and molecular tools can be crucial both in terms of breeding and conservation of genetic diversity of captive Great-billed Seed-Finches."
