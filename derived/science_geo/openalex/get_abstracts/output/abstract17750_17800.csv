https://openalex.org/W1994522080,"In order to understand the structural bases of ion conduction, ion selectivity, and gating in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, mutagenesis and covalent modification were combined to identify the amino acid residues that line the channel. The side chains of alternate residues—Ser248, Leu250, Ser252, and Thr254—in M2, a membrane-spanning segment of the α subunit, are exposed in the closed channel. Thus α248-254 probably forms a β strand, and the gate is closer to the cytoplasmic end of the channel than any of these residues. On channel opening, Leu251 is also exposed. These results lead to a revised view of the closed and open channel structures."

The wee1+ kinase negatively regulates mitosis by phosphorylating p34cdc2 on tyrosine 15, thereby inactivating the p34cdc2-cyclin B complex. The human homolog of the wee1+ gene (WEE1Hu) was overproduced in bacteria and assayed in an in vitro system. Unlike its fission yeast homolog, the product of the WEE1Hu gene encoded a tyrosine-specific protein kinase. The human WEE1 kinase phosphorylated the p34cdc2-cyclin B complex on tyrosine 15 but not on threonine 14 in vitro and inactivated the p34cdc2-cyclin B kinase. This inhibition was reversed by the human Cdc25C protein, which catalyzed the dephosphorylation of p34cdc2. These results indicate that the product of the WEE1Hu gene directly regulates the p34cdc2-cyclin B complex in human cells and that a kinase other than that encoded by WEE1Hu phosphorylates p34cdc2 on threonine 14."

https://openalex.org/W2012132694,"We have used homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells to generate mice carrying a mutation in the gene encoding P0, an immunoglobulin-related recognition molecule and the major protein of peripheral nervous system myelin. These mice are deficient in normal motor coordination and exhibit tremors and occasional convulsions. Axons in their peripheral nerves are severely hypomyelinated and a subset of myelin-like figures and axons degenerate. The mutation leads to an abnormal regulation of some, but not all, molecules involved in myelination. These results demonstrate that P0 is essential for the normal spiraling, compaction, and maintenance of the peripheral myelin sheath and the continued integrity of associated axons. They further suggest that this protein conveys a signal that regulates Schwann cell gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W1966272997,"The unc-5 gene is required for guiding pioneering axons and migrating cells along the body wall in C. elegans. In mutants, dorsal migrations are disrupted, but ventral and longitudinal movements are largely unaffected. The gene was tagged for molecular cloning by transposon insertions. Based on genomic and cDNA sequencing, the gene encodes UNC-5, a transmembrane protein of 919 aa. The predicted extracellular N-terminus comprises two immunoglobulin and two thrombospondin type 1 domains. Except for an SH3-like motif, the large intracellular C-terminus is novel. Mosaic analysis shows that unc-5 acts in migrating cells and pioneering neurons. We propose that UNC-5 is a transmembrane receptor expressed on the surface of motile cells and growth cones to guide dorsal movements."
https://openalex.org/W2051100798,"Hepatitis B viruses (hepadnaviruses) replicate their DNA genomes by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate. Efforts to examine the biochemical mechanism for viral DNA synthesis have been hampered by the failure to solubilize the reverse transcriptase from virions and to express the polymerase in heterologous systems in an enzymatically active form. Here, we demonstrate that the polymerase of a hepadnavirus synthesized in an in vitro translation reaction exhibits reverse transcriptase activity. Furthermore, our results show that the polymerase acts as a primer for DNA synthesis and remains covalently linked to nascent DNA, a feature that is not known to exist in any other RNA-directed DNA polymerases. Priming of DNA synthesis requires viral RNA but occurs independently of other viral components. The ability to express the hepadnavirus reverse transcriptase in an enzymatically active form will allow detailed biochemical and functional analyses of this complex enzyme, and may facilitate the identification of inhibitors required for antiviral therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1531820450,"Serum contains a factor that co-purifies with albumin and causes neurite retraction in PC12 cells, inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells in vitro, and activates the phosphatidylinositol/Ca2+ second messenger system in Xenopus oocytes and other cells. The activity of serum albumin depends on several lysophospholipids bound to albumin. Thin layer chromatographic analysis of the lipids extracted by methanol from serum albumin revealed over a dozen components, several of which evoked oscillatory currents in oocytes. In contrast to serum albumin, most of these lipids were absent in plasma, which lacks the biological activity. The most abundant naturally occurring active component was identified as stearoyl-lysophosphatidic acid. Synthetically prepared lysophosphatidates reproduced the biological activities of the natural serum factor. Adding synthetic lysophosphatidates to inactive fatty acid-free albumin restored activity to the albumin, making the active factor nondialyzable against aqueous solvents and protecting against digestion by various lipases. Since the biologically active lysophosphatidates were produced during blood clotting, in the presence of platelets, and lysophosphatidates have been shown previously to activate platelets, we propose that lysophosphatidates may play an important role in linking platelet activation to receptor-mediated tissue regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1569741533,"Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding proteins (IGFBPs) either inhibit or enhance IGF-stimulated cellular effects. While inhibition occurs by sequestration of IGF from cell-surface receptors, the exact mechanism of IGF-enhancement remains undefined. Human osteoblast-like bone cells in culture secrete several IGF-binding proteins, one of which we have previously identified as IGFBP-5. In this study we purified a 23-kDa IGFBP-5 from cultures of human osteoblast-like cells using ligand affinity chromatography and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography and tested its bioactivity in serum-free cultures of normal mouse osteoblast-like cells. Binding studies with radioiodinated IGF showed similar and relatively low affinities for IGF-I and IGF-II consistent with a carboxyl truncated IGF-binding protein. Mitogenic assays demonstrated that the binding protein, when coincubated with IGF-I or -II, enhanced mitogenesis. This enhancement was unique from other binding proteins in not requiring a preincubation period or serum co-factors. Furthermore, the osteoblast-derived IGFBP-5 stimulated mitogenesis in the absence of exogenous or endogenous IGF. Using radioiodinated IGFBP-5 we found that the binding protein could associate with the osteoblast surface, an effect which did not require IGF nor an interaction with IGF receptors. We suggest that osteoblast-derived IGFBP-5 may stimulate osteoblast mitogenesis in at least two ways, by association with IGF and by a second pathway that is independent of IGF receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W1966094651,"To investigate the role of the gp140trk receptor tyrosine kinase in nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced differentiation, we have overexpressed gp140trk in the NGF-responsive PC12 cell line. Here we demonstrate that overexpression of gp140trk results in marked changes in NGF-induced differentiation. Whereas PC12 cells elaborated neurites after 2 days of continuous exposure to NGF, PC12 cells overexpressing gp140trk by 20-fold(trk-PC12) began this process within hours. Compared with wild-type PC12 cells, trk-PC12 exhibited an increase in both high and low affinity NGF-binding sites. Furthermore, trk-PC12 cells displayed an enhanced level of NGF-dependent gp140trk autophosphorylation, and this activity was sustained for many hours following ligand binding. The tyrosine phosphorylation or activity of several cellular proteins, such as PLC-gamma 1, PI-3 kinase, and Erk1 and the expression of the mRNA for the late response gene transin were also sustained as a consequence of gp140trk overexpression. The data indicate that overexpression of gp140trk in PC12 cells markedly accelerates NGF-induced differentiation pathways, possibly through the elevation of gp140trk tyrosine kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1524336750,"IRS-1 is a major insulin receptor substrate which may play an important role in insulin signal transmission. The mRNA for IRS-1 in rat cells and tissues is about 9.5 kilobases (kb). Rat liver IRS-1 was stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (CHO/IRS-1). Although its calculated molecular mass is 131 kDa, IRS-1 from quiescent cells migrated between 165 and 170 kDa during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. IRS-1 was phosphorylated strongly on serine residues and weakly on threonine residues before insulin stimulation. Insulin immediately stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, and after 10-30 min with insulin its apparent molecular mass increased to 175-180 kDa. Expression of the human insulin receptor and rat IRS-1 together in CHO/IR/IRS-1 cells increased the basal serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and strongly increased tyrosine phosphorylation during insulin stimulation. Purified insulin receptors directly phosphorylated baculovirus-produced IRS-1 exclusively on tyrosine residues. By immunofluorescence, IRS-1 was absent from the nucleus, but otherwise distributed uniformly before and after insulin stimulation. Some IRS-1 associated with the insulin receptor during insulin stimulation. In addition, a phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase associated with IRS-1 during insulin stimulation, and this association was more sensitive to insulin in CHO cells overexpressing the insulin receptor (CHO/IR cells), more responsive to insulin to CHO/IRS-1 cells, and both sensitive and responsive in CHO/IR/IRS-1 cells. Similarly, insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis was more sensitive to insulin in CHO/IR cells, and more responsive in CHO/IRS-1 cells; however, insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis was sensitive but poorly responsive to insulin in CHO/IR/IRS-1 cells. Together, these results suggest that IRS-1 is a direct physiologic substrate of the insulin receptor and may play an important role in insulin signal transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1653031648,"In the skin, wounding initiates a complex array of physiological processes mediated by growth factors and inflammatory mediators which stimulate tissue repair and protect against infection. We report that primary cultures of human keratinocytes and a mouse keratinocyte cell line respond to the inflammatory stimuli gamma-interferon and lipopolysaccharide or tumor necrosis factor-alpha by producing nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide, two reactive mediators that are important in nonspecific host defense. Nitric oxide is produced by the l-arginine- and NADPH-dependent enzyme, nitric oxide synthase. In murine keratinocytes, optimal enzymatic activity was found to be dependent on Ca2+ and calmodulin as well as on glutathione. Inflammatory mediators were also found to inhibit the growth of keratinocytes, an effect that could be reversed by a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), which promotes wound healing by stimulating cellular proliferation, was found to be a potent antagonist of reactive nitrogen and reactive oxygen intermediate production by keratinocytes. EGF also reversed the growth inhibitory actions of the inflammatory mediators. These data suggest that nitric oxide produced by keratinocytes is important in the control of cellular proliferation during wound healing. Our findings that EGF effectively regulates the production of free radicals by keratinocytes may represent an important pathway by which this growth factor not only stimulates epidermal cell proliferation but also facilitates the resolution of inflammation following wounding."
https://openalex.org/W1542778840,"Growth factors stimulate the enzyme phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase in cells in culture. Insulin rapidly stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of its endogenous substrate, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), and in vitro IRS-1 associates with PI 3-kinase, thus activating the enzyme. We have examined whether insulin is capable of stimulating the PI 3-kinase pathway in two physiological target tissues for the actions of insulin in vivo, liver and skeletal muscle. After intraportal injection of insulin into anesthetized rats, there was a 2-fold stimulation of total hepatic PI 3-kinase activity in liver and muscle extracts and a 10- to 20-fold increase in PI 3-kinase activity immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1 antibodies. Stimulation of PI 3-kinase was accompanied by an association between this enzyme and IRS-1 as detected by immunoprecipitation of liver and muscle extracts with anti-IRS-1 antibodies and Western blotting with antibodies to the 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase. Immunoprecipitation with anti-p85 antibodies and phosphotyrosine immunoblotting revealed no tyrosine phosphorylation of PI 3-kinase, but demonstrated co-precipitation of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1, as well as another phosphotyrosine protein of approximately 135-140 kDa. Thus, IRS-1 phosphorylation plays a significant role in the activation of PI 3-kinase in vivo by insulin."
https://openalex.org/W2016415553,"Brief glutamate applications to membrane patches, excised from neurons in the rat visual cortex, were used to assess the role of desensitization in determining the AMPA/kainate receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) time course. A brief (1 ms) application of glutamate (1–10 mM) produced a response that mimicked the time course of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs). Direct evidence is presented that the rate of onset of desensitization is much slower than the decay rate of the response to a brief application of glutamate, implying that the decay of mEPSCs reflects channel closure into a state readily available for reactivation. Rapid application of glutamate combined with nonstationary variance analysis provided an estimate of the single-channel conductance and open probability, allowing an approximation of the number of available channels at a single synaptic site."
https://openalex.org/W2090407149,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) selectively evokes an inward (excitatory) current in cultured lobster olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and directly activates two types of channels in cell-free patches of plasma membrane from the ORNs. The IP3-activated channels have kinetic properties of odor-activated channels in the ORNs and pharmacological properties of intracellular IP3-activated channels in other systems. An antibody directed against an intracellular, cerebellar IP3 receptor recognizes a protein with a molecular weight similar to the mammalian receptor in the ORNs. The antibody selectively increases odor-evoked inward currents and IP3-activated unitary currents in the ORNs. The data provide further evidence for IP3 as an olfactory second messenger and implicate at least one and possibly two novel plasma membrane I P, receptors in olfactory transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2086037471,"Migration of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils on vitronectin is dependent on repeated transient increases in the concentration of intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i). A specific peptide inhibitor of the Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin was introduced into the cytoplasm of neutrophils. The peptide inhibited neutrophil migration on vitronectin by interfering with the release of the cells from sites of attachment. A similar reduction in motility on vitronectin occurred when cells were treated with the immunosuppressant FK506, which also inhibits calcineurin when bound to its binding protein, FKBP. These results indicate that a rise in [Ca2+]i reduces integrin-mediated adhesion to vitronectin by a mechanism that requires calcineurin activity."

https://openalex.org/W1548346922,"The effects of human red cell glycophorin A (GPA) on the expression of the human erythrocyte anion transporter (band 3, AE1) has been examined in Xenopus oocytes. The coexpression of GPA with band 3 increased stilbene disulfonate-sensitive chloride transport into the oocytes. The effect of GPA was particularly noticeable at low band 3 concentrations and less marked at high band 3 cRNA concentrations. The enhancement of chloride transport was specific to GPA and was not observed when either glycophorin B or glycophorin C was coexpressed with band 3. Immunoprecipitations of whole oocyte homogenates showed the amount of band 3 synthesized was not affected by GPA at subsaturating cRNA concentrations. More band 3 was detected at the oocyte surface by immunoprecipitation when GPA was also expressed. Chymotrypsin treatment of intact oocytes was also used to assess surface band 3 and greater cleavage of band 3 by chymotrypsin was observed when GPA was present. Band 3 synthesis and assembly into canine pancreatic microsomes in the reticulocyte cell-free translation system was not altered by cotranslation of GPA. We suggest that GPA facilitates the translocation of band 3 to the plasma membrane at some point during band 3 biosynthesis in Xenopus oocytes. However, GPA is not essential for the expression of band 3 in red cells, since GPA-deficient individuals have apparently normal levels of band 3. Other GPA-independent mechanisms must also allow translocation of band 3 to the surface membrane in erythroid cells and oocytes. GPA may affect the rate of accumulation of band 3 at the cell surface, rather than the final level in the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2014009451,"In olfactory receptor neurons, odorants stimulate production of cAMP, which directly activates cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels. Olfactory adaptation is thought to result from a rise in intracellular Ca2+. To determine whether inhibition of CNG channels plays a role in adaptation, we have investigated the action of Ca2+ on these channels in inside-out “macro” patches from the dendrite and cilia of catfish olfactory neurons. Internal Ca2+, with a of 3 μM, profoundly inhibits CNG channels by shifting the dose-response relationship to higher CAMP levels without altering the maximal response. The inhibition does not appear to result from a direct interaction of Ca 2+ with the CNG channel. Thus, the inhibition washes out after excision of the inside-out patch, and Ca 2+ does not inhibit the cloned catfish CNG channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Hence we propose that a regulatory Ca2+-binding protein, distinct from the CNG channel, controls the gain of signal transduction and contributes to olfactory adaptation by decreasing the sensitivity of the CNG channel to CAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1655072337,"The mechanism of growth hormone (GH) action was studied in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with GH receptor cDNA. Cytosolic extracts from GH- or phorbol ester (12-O-tetradecanoyl 4 beta-phorbol 13-acetate)-treated cells, transfected with full-length GH receptor cDNA, had an enhanced ability to phosphorylate myelin basic protein. Myelin basic protein, a substrate for mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, was maximally phosphorylated using extracts from cells treated with 50 nM bovine GH for 10 min. In addition, GH treatment resulted in an increased cell proliferation by 30-60%. GH and 12-O-tetradecanoyl 4 beta-phorbol 13-acetate cause tyrosine phosphorylation of two proteins with M(r) of 40,000 and 42,000 that are also recognized by MAP kinase antibodies. These proteins were identified as MAP kinases by analyzing phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates on Western blots using MAP kinase antibodies. In addition, GH induces mitogenicity, as well as MAP kinase activation, in CHO cells expressing a receptor in which 184 amino acids had been deleted in the carboxyl-terminal part of the intracellular domain. No GH effects were seen in untransfected cells, in CHO cells expressing a truncated GH receptor containing only 5 of 349 amino acids in the intracellular domain, or in cells expressing the soluble GH-binding protein. In conclusion, our data show that GH treatment of CHO cells, reconstituted with GH receptors, initiates a phosphorylation cascade which includes MAP kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1565072410,"Nitric oxide (NO) has been previously shown to inhibit crude preparations of ribonucleotide reductase, a key enzyme in DNA synthesis, and to destroy the essential tyrosyl free radical in pure recombinant R2 subunit of the enzyme. In R2-overexpressing TA3 cells, a decrease in the tyrosyl radical was observed by whole-cell EPR spectroscopy, as soon as 4 h after NO synthase induction by immunological stimuli. Complete loss of the tyrosyl EPR signal occurred after 7 h in cells cultured at a high density. Disappearance of the tyrosyl radical was prevented by N omega-nitro-L-arginine, a specific inhibitor of NO synthesis, and by oxyhemoglobin, which reacts rapidly with NO. It was reproduced by S-nitrosoglutathione, a NO-releasing molecule. Stable end products of NO synthase metabolism did not affect the radical. Immunoblot analysis of the R2 subunit indicated that expression of the protein was not influenced by NO synthase activity. These results establish that NO, or a labile product of NO synthase, induces the disappearance of the R2-centered tyrosyl radical. Since the radical is necessary for ribonucleotide reductase activity, its destruction by NO would contribute markedly to the antiproliferative action exerted by macrophage-type NO synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1498564737,"Evidence from the literature suggests that the nervous and the immune systems closely interact via neuromediators, which affect the immune system, and cytokines, which control nerve cell growth and activity. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide that has been identified in numerous tissues including immune organs and inhibits the proliferation of spleen cells. We investigated whether CGRP altered the function of T lymphocytes. We present evidence that CGRP induces a dose-dependent cAMP accumulation in interleukin 2-producing TH1 cells and inhibits their production of interleukin 2. These effects are prevented by CGRP8-37, a CGRP antagonist that is missing the first 7 amino acids. This CGRP-mediated inhibition of interleukin 2 production is accompanied by a decrease in interleukin 2 mRNA accumulation. CGRP also inhibits the accumulation of mRNA coding for tumor necrosis factor-alpha and -beta and interferon-gamma. Thus, we have identified one mechanism by which CGRP inhibits the proliferation of spleen cells."
https://openalex.org/W1983093761,"The in vitro folding pathway of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) has been described previously in terms of the disulfide-bonded intermediates that accumulate during folding of the protein. Folding is slow, occurring in hours at pH 7.3, 25 degrees C. In addition, approximately half of the BPTI molecules become trapped as a dead-end, native-like intermediate. In vivo, BPTI is synthesized as a precursor protein that includes a 13 residue amino-terminal pro region. This pro region contains a cysteine residue. We find that, in vitro, both the rate of formation and the yield of properly folded BPTI are increased substantially in a recombinant model of pro-BPTI. The cysteine residue is necessary for this effect. Moreover, a single cysteine residue, tethered to the carboxy-terminal end of BPTI with a flexible linker of repeating Ser-Gly-Gly residues, is sufficient to assist in disulfide formation. Thus, the pro region appears to facilitate folding by providing a tethered, solvent-accessible, intramolecular thiol-disulfide reagent."
https://openalex.org/W2062535587,"Kinesin is believed to generate force for the movement of organelles in anterograde axonal transport. The identification of genes that encode kinesin-like proteins suggests that other motors may provide anterograde force instead of or in addition to kinesin. To gain insight into the specific functions of kinesin, the effects of mutations in the kinesin heavy chain gene (khc) on the physiology and ultrastructure of Drosophila larval neurons were studied. Mutations in khc impair both action potential propagation in axons and neurotransmitter release at nerve terminals but have no apparent effect on the concentration of synaptic vesicles in nerve terminal cytoplasm. Thus kinesin is required in vivo for normal neuronal function and may be active in the transport of ion channels and components of the synaptic release machinery to their appropriate cellular locations. Kinesin appears not to be required for the anterograde transport of synaptic vesicles or their components."
https://openalex.org/W1497364567,"The immunoregulant FK-506 potently inhibits particular calcium-associated signal transduction events that occur early during T-lymphocyte activation and during IgE receptor-mediated exocytosis in mast cells. FK-506 binds to a growing family of receptors termed FK-506-binding proteins (FKBPs), the most abundant being a 12-kDa cytosolic receptor, FKBP12. To date, there is no formal evidence proving that FKBP12 is the sole receptor mediating the immunosuppressive effects or toxic side effects of FK-506. Using gel filtration chromatography as an assay for novel FK-506-binding proteins, we identified FK-506 binding activities in extracts prepared from calf brain and from JURKAT cells. Both of these new activities comigrated with apparent molecular masses of 110 kDa. However, further characterization of both binding activities revealed that the two are not identical. The 110-kDa activity observed in brain extracts appears to be the FKBP12.FK-506.calcineurin (CaN) complex previously reported (Liu, J., Farmer, J., Lane, W., Friedman, J., Weissman, I., and Schreiber, S. (1991) Cell 66, 807-815) while the 110 kDa activity observed in JURKAT cells is a novel FK-506-binding protein. Our characterization of the FKBP12.FK-506.CaN complex reveals a dependence upon calmodulin (CaM) for formation of the complex and demonstrates that the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity of FKBP12 is not required for binding of FKBP12.FK-506 to CaN or for inhibition of CaN phosphatase activity. The novel FK-506-binding protein in JURKAT cells has been purified to homogeneity, migrates with an apparent mass of 51 kDa on denaturing gels, and has been termed FKBP51. Like FKBP12, FKBP51 has PPIase activity, but, unlike FKBP12.FK-506, FKBP51.FK-506 does not complex with or inhibit the phosphatase activity of, CaN. These results indicate that complex formation with CaN may not be a general property of the FKBPs. Peptide sequencing reveals that FKBP51 may be similar, if not identical, to hsp56, a component of non-transformed steroid receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1566622078,"A region in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor between amino acids 4014 and 4765 was expressed as a trpE fusion protein. Overlay studies revealed that this region bound Ca2+ and ruthenium red, an indicator of Ca(2+)-binding sites. Ca2+ binding was mapped to subregion 13b between amino acids 4246 and 4377, encompassing a predicted high affinity Ca(2+)-binding site, and to subregion 13c between amino acids 4364 and 4529, encompassing two predicted high affinity Ca(2+)-binding sites. Ca2+ binding was then mapped to three shorter sequences, 22(13b1), 36(13c1), and 35(13c2), amino acids long, each encompassing one of the three predicted Ca(2+)-binding sites. Site-directed polyclonal antibodies were raised against these three short sequences and purified on antigen affinity columns. The antibody against sequence 13c2, lying between residues 4478 and 4512, specifically recognized both denatured and native forms of the ryanodine receptor, suggesting that at least part of the 35 amino acid sequence containing the Ca(2+)-binding site is surface-exposed. The affinity purified antibody increased the Ca2+ sensitivity of ryanodine receptor channels incorporated into planar lipid bilayers, resulting in increased open probability and opening time without altering channel conductance. The antibody-activated channel was still modulated by Ca2+, Mg2+, ATP, ryanodine, and ruthenium red. These observations suggest that sequence 13c2 may be involved in Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release."

https://openalex.org/W1545503393,"Vitronectin (VN, complement S-protein) is a multifunctional protein which participates in cell adhesion, coagulation, fibrinolysis, and protection against complement lysis. VN is incorporated into several complexes, such as the terminal complement complex and thrombin-antithrombin III, and is bound to plasminogen activator inhibitor 1. The present study showed that purified VN spontaneously forms polymers of approximately 1000 kDa with a Stokes radius of 10 nm. The polymers are to a varying extent stabilized by disulfide bonds, but are quite stable even after reduction and alkylation, indicating the importance of noncovalent bonds. Plasma VN circulates mainly as a 65/75-kDa monomer containing a cryptic heparin-binding site which is exposed upon a conformational change induced by different stimuli, such as coagulation, heating, adsorption to surfaces, or exposure to acids, urea, or other denaturating agents. In the present study, VN was demonstrated to expose its heparin-binding site and its conformationally dependent 8E6 epitope when incorporated into the terminal complement complex. We suggest that exposure of the heparin-binding site and a putative hydrophobic binding site of VN are linked events dependent upon the same conformational change. In vivo, complex formation probably induces the heparin-binding site. Such a link might also explain why purified heparin-binding VN spontaneously forms polymers. The heparin-binding site may be involved in the elimination of multimolecular complexes containing VN."
https://openalex.org/W1517753892,"After adding insulin to cells overexpressing the insulin receptor, the activity of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase in the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates was rapidly and greatly increased. This enzyme may therefore be a substrate for the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and may be one of the mediators of insulin signal transduction. However, it is unclear whether or not activated tyrosine kinase of the insulin receptor directly phosphorylates PI 3-kinase at tyrosine residue(s) and whether insulin stimulates the specific activity of PI 3-kinase. We reported previously that the 85-kDa subunit of purified PI 3-kinase was phosphorylated at tyrosine residue(s) by the insulin receptor in vitro. To examine the tyrosine phosphorylation of PI 3-kinase and change of its activity by insulin treatment in vivo, we used a specific antibody to the 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase. The activity of PI 3-kinase in immunoprecipitates with the antibody against the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase was increased about 3-fold by insulin treatment of cells overexpressing insulin receptors. Insulin treatment also stimulated the tyrosine, serine, and threonine phosphorylation of the alpha-type 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase in vivo. Phosphatase treatment of the immunoprecipitates abolished the increase in PI 3-kinase activity. The phosphorylation(s) of the kinase itself, tyrosine phosphorylation(s) of associated protein(s), or the complex formation of the phosphorylated PI 3-kinase with associated proteins may increase the activity of PI 3-kinase."
https://openalex.org/W190811485,"Recently, embryonic chicken brain extract was shown to contain a glucuronyltransferase, which transfers glucuronic acid from UDP-glucuronic acid to glycolipid acceptors (neolactotetraosyl ceramide). The enzyme was also suggested to transfer glucuronic acid to glycoprotein acceptors (asialoorosomucoid) (Das, K. K., Basu, M., Basu, S., Chou, D. K. H., and Jungalwala, F. B. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 5238-5243). In this study, the glucuronyltransferase activity in rat brain extract was separated into two groups by UDP-glucuronic acid-Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography. The enzyme recovered predominantly in the effluent fraction (GlcAT-L) catalyzed the transfer of glucuronic acid to glycolipid acceptors but not to glycoprotein acceptors, whereas the enzyme recovered in the eluate fraction (GlcAT-P) transferred glucuronic acid most predominantly to glycoprotein acceptors and very little to glycolipid acceptors. GlcAT-P was able to transfer glucuronic acid to oligosaccharide chains on asialoorosomucoid. The enzyme recognized a terminal lactosamine structure, Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc, on glycoproteins. It was localized in the nervous system and was hardly detectable in other tissues, including the thymus, spleen, lung, kidney, and liver. Although GlcAT-L and GlcAT-P shared some properties in common such as tissue distributions and developmental changes, they exhibited marked differences in their phospholipid dependence and in their pH profiles, apart from their respective acceptor preference to glycolipids and glycoproteins. The acceptor specificity and tissue distribution suggest that a novel glucuronyltransferase, GlcAT-P, is involved in the biosynthesis of the sulfoglucuronylgalactose structure in the HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope that is expressed on glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1538274231,"Heat shock protein 56 (hsp56) has been shown to be involved in two cellular pathways, as an immunophilin for FK506 and as a component of steroid receptor complexes. To help define its role in these cellular pathways, we have developed UPJ56, a polyclonal antibody raised against hsp56 purified from Jurkat cells. In Western blot experiments, hsp56 was highly expressed in rat thymus, liver, and spleen, with low levels in lung and muscle. In immunofluorescence experiments using untreated LLC-PK1 cells, fibrillar staining was seen in the cytoplasm, suggesting a cytoskeletal localization of hsp56. The nuclei were brightly stained, except for the nucleoli. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that the staining was present in all planes of the nucleus. These results suggest that hsp56 is expressed in tissues enriched in steroid receptors and is highly expressed in tissues involved in T cell function. Furthermore, the localization of hsp56 with the cytoskeleton and throughout the nucleus is consistent with its association with steroid receptor complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1502632447,"The T-lymphocyte glycoprotein receptor, CD2, mediates cell-cell adhesion by binding to the surface molecule CD58 (LFA-3) on many cell types including antigen presenting cells. Two domains comprise the CD2 extracellular segment, with all adhesion functions localized to the amino-terminal domain that contains a single N-glycosylation site at Asn65. We have defined an important role for the N-linked glycans attached to Asn65 of this domain in mediating CD2-CD58 interactions and also characterize its N-glycotype structure. Analysis of deglycosylated soluble recombinant CD2 as well as a mutant transmembrane CD2 molecule containing a single Asn65-Gln65 substitution demonstrates that neither deglycosylated CD2 nor the mutant CD2 transmembrane receptor binds CD58 or monoclonal antibodies directed at native CD2 adhesion domain epitopes. Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry demonstrates that high mannose oligosaccharides ((Man)nGlcNAc2, n = 5-9) are the only N-glycotypes occupying Asn65 when soluble CD2 is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Based on a model of human CD2 secondary structure, we propose that N-glycosylation is required for stabilizing domain 1 in the human receptor. Thus, N-glycosylation is essential for human CD2 adhesion functions."
https://openalex.org/W1602700702,"alpha 1-Microglobulin (A1M) and bikunin are plasma proteins which are present both as free molecules and as complexes with either IgA heavy chains for A1M or the H1, H2, and H3 heavy chains of the inter-alpha-inhibitor family for bikunin. Mature A1M and bikunin originate from the cleavage of an A1M/bikunin precursor (ABP) synthesized from a single gene with liver-specific expression. Five kilobases of the 5'-flanking region of the human ABP gene were sequenced. Deletion mutants of this region subcloned upstream of a CAT reporter gene were transfected into HepG2 hepatoma cells. A segment covering the -2.7- to -2.8-kb area is required for full activity of the ABP gene. This segment contains a cluster of six elements (boxes 1-6, 5' to 3') which are potential binding sites for the liver-enriched trans-acting factors HNF-1, HNF-4, HNF-3, HNF-1, HNF-3, and HNF-4, respectively. This cluster enhances the activity of heterologous minimal promoters in a position- and distance-independent fashion in HepG2 cells. This enhancer activity is restricted to liver cells as the cluster is unable to activate promoters in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or HeLa cells. By band-shift experiments we have shown that the liver-enriched transcription factors HNF-1, or HNF-3, do bind to boxes 1 and 4, or 3, respectively. The combination of a weak promoter and a strong distant and liver-specific enhancer distinguishes the ABP gene from most other plasma protein genes expressed in hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1539983205,"ELAM1 (endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1, also known as E-selectin) is a highly tissue-specific adhesion molecule that is transiently and exclusively expressed on cytokine-induced endothelial cells. We have identified two proximal ELAM1 promoter elements and their DNA-binding factors that are, in addition to NF-kappa B, essential for ELAM1 transcription. Mutation of either element in promoter constructs carrying the first 383 nucleotides of the ELAM1 promoter markedly diminshed the expression of a fused chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. Although multimers of either element failed to display enhancer activity on its own, fusion of the most upstream of these to the NF-kappa B element had a strong stimulatory effect. This site, ACATCAT, is recognized by a factor we have called NF-ELAM1. The site corresponds to NF-ELAM1's preferential binding sequence (A/T)CA(G/T)CA(G/T) as determined in a target definition assay. This element is identical to the T-cell delta A enhancer found in the T-cell receptor-alpha, -beta, and CD3 delta genes. Our results suggest that the delta A/NF-ELAM1 element can function as a modulator of NF-kappa B in endothelial cells both as well as a T-cell enhancer."
https://openalex.org/W1550288583,"The gamma subunit of the high affinity IgE receptor, Fc epsilon RI, is a member of a family of proteins which form disulfide-linked dimers. This family also includes the zeta- and eta-chains of the T cell receptor. Engagement of Fc epsilon RI activates src-related protein tyrosine kinases in basophils and mast cells. However, the role of individual subunits of Fc epsilon RI in this activation is still not known. In an effort to determine the function of Fc epsilon RI-gamma, we used chimeric proteins containing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the alpha chain of the human interleukin 2 receptor (Tac) and the cytoplasmic domains of either T cell receptor-zeta or Fc epsilon RI-gamma. We show that while cross-linking of the Tac chimeras in the rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2H3 resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of a subset of proteins and a portion of the degranulation normally observed after Fc epsilon RI-mediated stimulation, no detectable activation of p56lyn or pp60c-src was observed. In contrast, an apparent transient deactivation of these two kinases was observed after Tac chimera cross-linking. These observations suggest that Fc epsilon RI-gamma is responsible for some, but not all, of the signaling that occurs after engagement of its receptor, and that other receptor subunits may also play important roles in this signaling process."
https://openalex.org/W1560835855,"The Ca(2+)-calmodulin (CaM)-dependent activation of myosin light chain kinase is inhibited by ruthenium red competitively with respect to Ca2+, with a Ki value of 8.6 microM. The binding of Ca2+ to CaM is inhibited by micromolar concentrations of ruthenium red. In the absence of Ca2+, CaM has two binding sites for ruthenium red with the dissociation constants of 0.36 and 8.7 microM, respectively. Ca2+ antagonizes the binding of ruthenium red to the low-affinity site on CaM. Binding of ruthenium red to the high-affinity site is not affected by Ca2+. The low- and high-affinity sites for ruthenium red are shown to be located in the NH2-terminal half and the COOH-terminal half of CaM, respectively. Lower concentrations of ruthenium red are needed for enzyme inactivation than for the dissociation of enzyme-CaM-Sepharose complex, suggesting these events have different Ca2+ requirements. Moreover, ruthenium red inhibits Ca(2+)-induced contraction of depolarized vascular smooth muscle in a competitive manner with respect to Ca2+. These results suggest that ruthenium red may be a new type of CaM antagonist that inhibits the binding of Ca2+ to CaM and thereby inhibits Ca(2+)-CaM-dependent enzymes and smooth muscle contraction competitively with respect to Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1826203825,"Abstract Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is attached to proteins in order to increase their half-life in the circulation and reduce their immunogenicity in vivo. For many applications involving targeting molecules, it is important to know how PEG modification of the molecule affects its interaction with a receptor and the subsequent internalization, intracellular transport, and lysosomal degradation. As a model system, we used asialofetuin, which binds to the galactose receptor of hepatocytes, because removal of sialic acid exposes galactose residues. We modified asialofetuin by attaching various amounts of PEG of molecular weight 1900 or 5000. The preparations were labeled with 125I so that endocytosis and degradation could be followed in suspended hepatocytes. Depending on the number of PEG molecules attached, receptor-mediated uptake was affected to varying degrees. If two-thirds of the exposed amino groups of the asialofetuin molecule were modified, the rate of uptake decreased to less than one-fourth of controls; degradation of endocytosed molecules was 12% of controls. The reduction in endocytic uptake was due to a reduced rate of formation of the receptor-ligand complex. Subcellular frationation in density gradients showed that PEG-modified asialofetuin is transported intracellularly and degraded in the same manner as the native protein, but the rate of proteolysis is reduced. This observation explains the paradoxical result of experiments with injection of modified asialofetuin into rats in vivo: even though the clearance of one preparation of PEG-asialofetuin was much slower than that of the native protein, accumulation of radioactivity in the liver from the modified protein was twice as high. The hepatocytes accounted for 85% of the hepatic accumulation of either PEG-modified or native asialofetuin in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1549855841,"The skeletal alpha-actin gene encodes a major component of the embryonic cardiac sarcomere that is strongly and selectively re-induced during beta-adrenoceptor-mediated hypertrophy in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. We present evidence that beta-adrenergic induction of this gene is mediated, not by cAMP, but by a calcium-dependent pathway involving ryanodine-sensitive calcium stores. Nifedipine-induced blockade of the plasma membrane L-type calcium entry channel prevented induction of skeletal alpha-actin mRNA by isoproterenol. Activation of calcium entry by the dihydropyridine agonist Bay K8644 independently induced skeletal alpha-actin mRNA, as did cholera toxin-mediated activation of Gs. Induction of skeletal alpha-actin mRNA by compounds that directly elevate cAMP was weak relative to their effects on other cAMP-dependent phenomena and required calcium entry. In addition, selective inhibition of protein kinase A with KT5720 did not block beta-adrenergic induction of skeletal alpha-actin. Calcium ionophore A23187 did not induce skeletal actin, but prevented its induction by isoproterenol. Ryanodine had bimodal effects: 10(-10) M ryanodine induced skeletal alpha-actin mRNA, whereas 10(-6) M ryanodine prevented skeletal actin induction by beta-adrenergic stimuli. We postulate that beta-adrenergic stimulation of skeletal alpha-actin mRNA requires G-protein-coupled calcium channel activation and compartmentalized calcium release in a manner independent of the cAMP/protein kinase A signal pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1629480809,"The bumetanide-sensitive component of pHi recovery from an NH4Cl-induced acute alkaline load was used as a measure of Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl- cotransport activity in rat parotid acini. Acinar treatment with NaF/AlCl3 (15 mM NaF plus 10 microM AlCl3) induced a 5-fold stimulation in the initial rate of bumetanide-sensitive pHi recovery. This effect was dependent on NaF concentration (K1/2 approximately 7 mM) and was blunted in the presence of the Al3+ chelator desferal mesylate suggesting that it might be due to the aluminofluoride ion, AlF-4. NaF/AlCl3 treatment did not increase acinar intracellular cAMP levels but did result in an increase in intracellular calcium concentration (from 87 +/- 5 to 181 +/- 2 nM) and in acinar cell shrinkage (12 +/- 1%). But the stimulation of the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl- cotransporter by NaF/AlCl3 persisted in acini which had been depleted of their intracellular Ca2+ stores. In these acini no effect of NaF/AlCl3 on intracellular calcium or cell volume was observed, indicating that stimulation of the cotransporter was not secondary to either of these phenomena. The effect of NaF/AlCl3 on the cotransporter was blocked by the protein kinase inhibitor K252a indicating the involvement of a protein phosphorylation event. This result is consistent with either NaF/AlCl3-dependent protein kinase activation or phosphatase inhibition. The stimulation of the cotransporter by NaF/AlCl3 was mimicked by the protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A; however, this effect was not blocked by K252a suggesting that a different protein kinase from that associated with NaF/AlCl3 may be involved. The data indicate that the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl- cotransporter in this tissue is under tight regulatory control, in all likelihood via multiple protein kinase/phosphatase systems. The physiological roles of these regulatory events in modulating acinar fluid secretion driven by the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl- cotransporter remain to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W1559790932,"A synthetic oligonucleotide was used to isolate mouse brain cDNA clones coding for a brain isoform of the alpha 1 subunit of the voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel. Twenty-six independent cDNA clones were isolated and sequenced. All the cDNA clones reported here showed high homology to the rat brain class C cDNA sequence (Snutch, T. P., Tomlinson, W. J., Leonard, J. P., and Gilbert, M. M. (1991) Neuron 7, 45-57). Comparison of the individual mouse brain class C (mbC) cDNA sequences indicated the presence of four regions within the alpha 1 subunit coding sequence where alternative splicing can take place in mouse brain and raise the possibility that combinatorial arrangement of these splice variants could give rise to a heterogenous class of mbC transcripts. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that mbC mRNA sequences could be detected in highest abundance in mouse heart, at lower levels in mouse brain and spinal cord, and not at all in liver or skeletal muscle. An expression vector for one isoform of the mbC alpha 1 subunit cDNA was constructed using the human cytomegalovirus promoter to direct expression, and this expression vector was used in a novel transfection assay of primary cultures of bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. Transfection of the mbC alpha 1 subunit expression vector increased the secretion of human growth hormone derived from a cotransfected human growth hormone expression vector after stimulation with elevated K+ or the dihydropyridine agonist, Bay K8644. These experiments suggest that this isoform of the mbC alpha 1 subunit is functional in the transfected chromaffin cells and that the number of Ca2+ channels is a limiting component in the secretion from chromaffin cells in culture."
https://openalex.org/W1507044748,"Abstract In order to facilitate studies of the assembly and transport of the site-specific RNase mitochondrial RNA processing (MRP) ribonucleoprotein, we have characterized it from Xenopus laevis cells. X. laevis RNase MRP displayed a similar spectrum of cleavage activity to that produced by previously isolated mammalian nuclear enzymes. A 277-nucleotide RNA component of the ribonucleoprotein was identified; the gene for the RNA was isolated, sequenced, and found to be 66 and 63% similar to mouse and human RNase MRP RNAs, respectively. Despite the evolutionary distance from its mammalian counterparts, X. laevis RNase MRP RNA contains five regions of homology to the mammalian RNase MRP RNA. Four of these regions correspond to those previously identified as conserved between RNase MRP and RNase P RNAs; the fifth encompasses nucleotides recently discovered to be sufficient for autoantigen binding. The expression and assembly of Xenopus RNase MRP RNA were examined in frog oocytes and developing embryos. RNase MRP RNA was expressed throughout oogenesis; it started to accumulate at stage I and reached a maximum in stage IV. During embryogenesis RNase MRP RNA expression began to elevate at approximately stage 22 and continued to rise through the swimming tadpole stage. When injected into the nucleus of mature oocytes, the X. laevis RNase MRP RNA gene was expressed accurately, and transcripts were packaged into immunoprecipitable particles."
https://openalex.org/W1506919831,"Abstract The inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor is an essential regulator of intracellular calcium in many cells including chemoattractant- and cytokine-stimulated neutrophils and differentiated promyelocytic leukemic (HL-60) cells. We examined the expression and function of the InsP3 receptor and the transcriptional regulation of the InsP3 receptor gene in HL-60 cells and in HL-60 cells treated for 1-5 days with 1 microM retinoic acid. Radioligand binding studies using membranes from control and retinoic acid-treated HL-60 cells showed that the Bmax of InsP3 receptor increased progressively from 0.24 to 0.69 pmol/mg protein during 5 days retinoic acid treatment with no change in KD (19 nM). During this period, maximal InsP3-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization increased 2-3-fold. InsP3 receptor mRNA was present at low levels in HL-60 cells but was increased significantly after treatment with retinoic acid, reaching maximal levels of approximately 4-fold greater than untreated cells after 4 days treatment with retinoic acid. Nuclear run-on assays indicated that the elevated steady state level of InsP3 receptor mRNA in retinoic acid-treated HL-60 cells was primarily the result of enhanced transcription of the InsP3 receptor gene. Furthermore, the transcriptional enhancing effect of retinoic acid was seen in the presence of cycloheximide, suggesting that the InsP3 receptor gene is directly regulated by retinoic acid. The studies also demonstrate that the InsP3 receptor mRNA is rapidly degraded in HL-60 cells by a mechanism that also requires protein synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1509847151,"To evaluate the functional role of the N-linked oligosaccharides of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, affinity-purified murine IAs class II molecules were deglycosylated in the presence of asparagine amidase enzyme. The deglycosylated IAs molecules were characterized by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis under reduced and native conditions and the complete enzymatic removal of all three N-linked sugar components from the alpha/beta heterodimer was confirmed by lectin-link Western blot analysis. Like the native IAs molecules, the deglycosylated IAs molecules were fully capable of binding an antigenic peptide from myelin basic protein MBP(89-101). The kinetics of dissociation of preformed complexes of IAs.MBP(89-101) and deglycosylated IAs.MBP(89-101) were compared at 4 and at 37 degrees C. Both complexes were equally stable at 4 degrees C; however, at 37 degrees C the deglycosylated IAs.MBP(89-101) complexes showed an increased rate of dissociation as compared with the native IAs.MBP(89-101) complexes. When tested for their ability to recognize the T cell receptor on T cells, both complexes bound to cloned HS-1 T cells that recognize and respond to IAs.MBP(89-101). Finally, the complexes of deglycosylated IAs.MBP(89-101) were tested for the induction of in vitro nonresponsiveness and compared with native IAs.MBP(89-101) complexes. Both complexes were capable of inducing 95-100% nonresponsiveness in a proliferation assay. These results suggest that the N-linked oligosaccharide of MHC class II molecules may not be essential for either antigenic peptide binding or T cell recognition. In addition results obtained here provide evidence that the carbohydrate moities of MHC class II molecules may not be involved in induction of T cell clonal anergy."
https://openalex.org/W1570263801,"The glycoprotein hormones lutropin (LH) and follitropin (FSH) are both synthesized by gonadotrophs in the anterior pituitary but are stored in separate secretory granules prior to secretion. Despite having highly homologous beta-subunits and alpha-subunits with the identical amino acid sequence, the Asn-linked oligosaccharides on LH terminate with SO4-GalNAc while those on FSH terminate with sialic acid-Gal. In addition to LH and FSH, gonadotrophs secrete uncombined (free) alpha-subunit which bears the same sulfated oligosaccharides as LH. We have examined the synthesis and secretion of LH and free alpha-subunit in primary cultures of bovine pituitary cells in order to determine if the sulfated oligosaccharides have any impact on sorting. Our results show that newly synthesized free alpha-subunit is secreted exclusively via the constitutive pathway with a t1/2 of 1.8 h and is never found in dense-core secretory granules. In contrast, LH dimer is secreted by both the constitutive and the regulated pathways. Constitutive secretion and arrival in a dense secretory granule both occur with t1/2 values of 1-1.5 h for newly synthesized LH. Sulfation occurs immediately prior to arrival of LH in the secretory granule and is followed by a period of 1-1.5 h before the LH-containing granules become sensitive to release by gonadotropin releasing hormone. As a result the t1/2 for LH secretion in the presence of gonadotropin releasing hormone is 3.5 h. Sulfation of the free alpha-subunit oligosaccharides is not, therefore, sufficient to direct the alpha-subunit to secretory granules, and the information required for directing LH to granules must reside either in the beta-subunit or the alpha beta-complex."
https://openalex.org/W1550295974,"We previously isolated and sequenced the 5'-flanking region of the mouse CD14 (mCD14) gene (Matsuura, K., Setoguchi, M., Nasu, N., Higuchi, Y., Yoshida, S., Akizuki, S., and Yamamoto, S. (1989) Nucleic Acids Res. 17, 2132). To define the regulatory elements that control expression of the mCD14 gene, we analyzed the structure of the 5' end of the gene, including a region further upstream of that determined previously. Sequentially 5'-deleted, chimeric, and point mutated clones were tested for the ability to stimulate chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. An 8-base pair sequence, TGATTCAC, at position -255, which resembled the consensus sequence of the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element (TRE), enhanced the expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene in macrophage (aHINS-B3) and non-macrophage (glioblastoma G203 and myeloma NS1) cells. The enhancing ability of the TRE-like sequence (TLS), however, was markedly reduced in G203 cells but not in aHINS-B3 cells when the TLS was followed by the sequence immediately downstream. The TLS and sequence immediately downstream were capable of binding nuclear proteins which were unique to aHINS-B3 cells and macrophages, suggesting that these unique protein regulate the specific expression of the mCD14 gene. Binding of AP-1 to the TLS was also found in aHINS-B3 and G203 cells. Although it is uncertain whether AP-1 is involved in expression of the mCD14 gene, the effect of AP-1 in non-macrophage cells was inhibited by a nuclear protein which binds to the sequence immediately downstream of the TLS."
https://openalex.org/W1511260897,"The extracellular matrix of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells was shown by indirect immunofluorescence to consist of a network of fibronectin. The matrix did not contain laminin. The cells synthesized messenger RNA for fibronectin, laminin B2, and s-laminin but not for entactin or the B1 and A chains of laminin. Laminin B2 but not laminin B1 was detectable in the culture medium and in cell lysates. A full-length cDNA clone for the B1 chain of laminin was constructed in the plasmid p-444, which contains the neomycin-resistance marker and human beta-actin promoter. PC12 cells were transfected with this recombinant plasmid, and stable neomycin-resistant clones were isolated and characterized. Clones that synthesized laminin B1 messenger RNA were found to deposit a laminin-containing matrix. In many of these clones the deposition of the fibronectin matrix was greatly diminished. The laminin matrix was predominantly localized in the intercellular spaces forming a honeycomb pattern. The morphology of the laminin-synthesizing transfected cells was markedly different from the parental cells. The cells grew in tight clusters that were resistant to dissociating agents. It is concluded that the B1 chain of laminin contains information that is required for the formation of a stable laminin-containing extracellular matrix network either by interaction with cell surface receptors or other extracellular matrix components. Furthermore, expression of the laminin B1 gene may be a central regulatory point in determining extracellular matrix composition during embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1539995209,"When the catalytically active, tyrosyl-phosphorylated form of insulin receptor was isolated from human placenta and treated with ADP, only partial dephosphorylation was observed. This observation suggests the existence of two distinct classes of phosphotyrosyl residues of the phosphorylated insulin receptor: one in which the phosphoryl groups undergo reversible transfer to ADP and one in which they do not. There were 8.8 +/- 2.2 phosphorylation sites per tetrameric insulin receptor, of which 2.4 +/- 0.5 were irreversible (mean +/- S.D., n = 6). The reversible sites were determined to be equivalent and noninteracting and to have an equilibrium constant for the transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP to a site of reversible phosphorylation of 8.7. Surprisingly, both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at the reversible sites were relatively insensitive to the presence of insulin. Since only minimal autophosphorylation of insulin receptor was detected in the absence of insulin, the results suggest that the incorporation of phosphate into the two to three irreversible phosphorylation sites is insulin dependent. Phosphorylation of the irreversible phosphorylation sites then renders the insulin receptor relatively insensitive to the continued presence of insulin and facilitates rapid reversible phosphorylation of a second group of tyrosyl residues. The dependence of the degree of phosphorylation of insulin receptor on the ATP:ADP ratio may provide a mechanism for modulating the cellular response to insulin."
