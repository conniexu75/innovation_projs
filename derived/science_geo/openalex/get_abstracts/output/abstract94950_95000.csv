https://openalex.org/W2103431676,"We have shown in the accompanying paper that a developmental transition occurs at the midblastula stage (cleavage 12) in Xenopus embryos, and that this midblastula transition (MBT) is apparently initiated when the ratio of nucleus to cytoplasm reaches a critical value. One manifestation of this transition is the onset of transcription. We show here that a plasmid containing a cloned gene coding for a yeast leucine tRNA comes under developmental control when injected into cleaving eggs. In pre-MBT eggs this plasmid is transiently transcribed and then becomes inactive; however, it becomes transcriptionally active again at the MBT. This pre-MBT suppression of transcription can be reversed by addition of competing DNA. The amount of DNA needed to induce premature transcription is equal to the amount of nuclear DNA present after 12 cleavages (24 ng), suggesting that the MBT is triggered by the DNA through titration of suppressor components present in the egg."

https://openalex.org/W1982728009,"We have anatomically analyzed retinotopic organization using the 14C-labeled 2-deoxy-D-glucose method. The method has several advantages over conventional electrophysiological mapping techniques. In the striate cortex, the anatomical substrate for retinotopic organization is surprisingly well ordered, and there seems to be a systematic relationship between ocular dominance strips and cortical magnification. The 2-deoxyglucose maps in this area appear to be largely uninfluenced by known differences in long-term metabolic activity. This method should prove useful in analyzing retinotopic organization in various visual areas of the brain and in different species."

At sea, dogfish and blue sharks were observed to execute apparent feeding responses to dipole electric fields designed to mimic prey. In training experiments, stingrays showed the ability to orient relative to uniform electric fields similar to those produced by ocean currents. Voltage gradients of only 5 nanovolts per centimeter would elicit either behavior."

https://openalex.org/W1984865875,"Training improves the ability of human observers to discriminate between two similar directions of motion. This gradual improvement is specific to the direction on which an observer is trained, and it endures for several months. Improvement does not affect motion perception generally, nor does it depend on recognition of details of the movement."
https://openalex.org/W2055536854,"Extracellular field potential and intracellular recordings from neurons in rat hippocampus show that, even with synaptic transmission blocked, antidromic electrical stimuli can trigger afterdischarges of up to 9 seconds duration; during these discharges action potentials of a single neuron were synchronized with extracellularly recorded population spikes. Apparently mechanisms other than recurrent chemical synapses can synchronize and recruit epileptiform events. Measurements of transmembrane potential indicate that transient extracellular electrical fields (ephaptic interactions) contribute to the observed synchrony; electrotonic coupling and changes in the concentration of extracellular ions may also contribute."
https://openalex.org/W1977972142,"Four RNA transcripts encoded by cauliflower mosaic virus DNA have been detected in the polyadenylated RNA from virus-infected turnip leaves. Two of these transcripts, the major 35S and the 8S species, have the same 5' termini, at nucleotide 7435. A viral DNA fragment encompassing this region directs transcription initiation at this point in vitro. The 5' terminus of the 19S transcript is at nucleotide 5764, and a corresponding viral DNA fragment also directs transcription initiation in vitro. The major 35S RNA is a complete transcript of the circular viral genome, and is 3'-coterminal with 19S RNA at nucleotide 7615. The 8S RNA has its 3' extremity at delta 1, the single-stranded interruption in the transcribed strand of virion DNA. A minor 35S RNA has also been detected that has its 5' and 3' termini at delta 1."

https://openalex.org/W2017164238,"The timing of two event-related potential components was differentially affected by two experimental variables. The earlier component (NA) was affected by degradation of the stimuli and the later component (N2) by the nature of a classification task. The results support the hypothesis that NA and N2 reflect sequential stages of information processing, namely, pattern recognition and stimulus classification."
https://openalex.org/W2012178305,"Cassava (Manihot esculenta) is the fourth most important source of food energy in the tropics. More than two-thirds of the total production of this crop is used as food for humans, with lesser amounts being used for animal feed and industrial purposes. The ingestion of high levels of cassava has been associated with chronic cyanide toxicity in parts of Africa, but this appears to be related to inadequate processing of the root and poor overall nutrition. Although cassava is not a complete food it is important as a cheap source of calories. The crop has a high yield potential under good conditions, and compared to other crops it excels under suboptimal conditions, thus offering the possibility of using marginal land to increase total agricultural production. Breeding programs that bring together germ plasm from different regions coupled with improved agronomic practices can markedly increase yields. The future demand for fresh cassava may depend on improved storage methods. The markets for cassava as a substitute for cereal flours in bakery products and as an energy source in animal feed rations are likely to expand. The use of cassava as a source of ethanol for fuel depends on finding an efficient source of energy for distillation or an improved method of separating ethanol from water."

Since these neurons inhibit the function of pituitary prolactin-secreting cells, their destruction may lead to development of prolactinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2025555550,"Heat shock of cell suspension cultures of tomato (Lycopersicon peruvianum) results in a rapid and reversible decline of the phosphorylation level of a single basic ribosomal protein of the small subunit (tentatively identified as ribosomal protein S6). Simultaneously, phosphate labeling of several acidic ribosomal proteins of the large subunit is enhanced. Data on the temperature-dependent distribution of S6 subspecies and on the kinetics and reversibility of S6 phosphorylation are given. The decreased phosphorylation of S6 at temperatures higher than 35 degrees C coincides with the onset of heat shock protein synthesis and precedes a decline of the mitotic index. Recovery from heat shock is characterized by S6 rephosphorylation and, subsequently, leads to an abnormally high mitotic index."
https://openalex.org/W2083665434,"The fluorescent probe merocyanine 540 does not stain the plasma membrane of normal human or murine erythrocytes, nor of genetically abnormal human spherocytic erythrocytes. It does, however, stain erythrocyte membranes in several systems in which the underlying spectrin network is altered or missing. Because of the greater affinity of merocyanine 540 for fluid—phase lipid bilayers, these results suggest that the external leaflet of erythrocyte membranes becomes more disordered upon alteration or loss of the internal spectrin network. Analysis of the transbilayer arrangement of membrane phospholipids by digestion with phospholipase A2 suggests that lipid compositional asymmetry of the erythrocyte membrane is responsible for a phase-state asymmetry between the two lipid leaflets, and that spectrin is required to maintain this asymmetry and the gel-like state of the external leaflet."

https://openalex.org/W2068820507,"Intraperitoneal injections of antibodies to pancreatic glucagon at the onset of the first meal after 12 hours of food deprivation increased meal size 63 percent and meal duration 74 percent in rats. The antibodies also reduced the increase in hepatic vein blood glucose that occurred during meals in control rats, but did not affect the prandial increase in portal vein blood glucose. These results suggest that, under these conditions, pancreatic glucagon is necessary for the normal termination of meals."

https://openalex.org/W2054518372,"We have measured methylation of the albumin gene in clones of rat hepatoma cells that vary quantitatively in their rates of synthesis of albumin and in variant and hybrid cells that produce no albumin. Although the albumin gene is undermethylated for its entire length in rat liver, only the 5′ end is ever undermethylated in hepatoma cells. Moreover, undermethylation of the 5′ end of the gene appears to be necessary for stable expression of the albumin gene in hepatoma cells. Since undermethylation of this region is found in some variant cells that fail to produce albumin, it is not a sufficient condition for albumin gene expression. Despite the excellent correlation between undermethylation of the 5′ end of the albumin gene and its stable expression, the results argue against the possibility that the methylated state of such genes during development determines whether they will or will not be expressed."
https://openalex.org/W2083058571,"Repetitive elicitation of startle-like responses by electrical stimulation of the cochlear nucleus led to sensitization followed by habituation. In contrast, repetitive elicitation of startle-like responses by electrical stimulation of the reticular formation led only to sensitization. Since these different locations represent different points along the acoustic startle circuit, the data suggest that sensitization may be related to the motor side of reflex arcs, whereas habituation may be related to the sensory side."
https://openalex.org/W2017595171,"Methylation of deoxycytidine incorporated by DNA excision-repair was studied in human diploid fibroblasts following damage with ultraviolet radiation, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, or N-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene. In confluent, nondividing cells, methylation in repair patches induced by all three agents is slow and incomplete. Whereas after DNA replication in logarithmic-phase cultures a steady state level of 3.4% 5-methylcytosine is reached in less than 2 hr after cells are labeled with 6- 3H-deoxycytidine, following ultraviolet-stimulated repair synthesis in confluent cells it takes about 3 days to reach a level of approximately 2.0% 5-methylcytosine in the repair patch. In cells from cultures in logarithmic-phase growth, 5-methylcytosine formation in ultraviolet-induced repair patches occurs faster and to a greater extent, reaching a level of approximately 2.7% in 10-20 hr. Preexisting hypomethylated repair patches in confluent cells are methylated further when the cells are stimulated to divide; however, the repair patch may still not be fully methylated before cell division occurs. Thus DNA damage and repair may lead to heritable loss of methylation at some sites."
https://openalex.org/W1989372892,"Odors of ten compounds were characterized by approximately 150 subjects who used a list of 146 descriptors. Duplicate profiles correlated highly (P less than .001) and consistently higher than profiles of different odors. Profiles also agreed with those obtained previously. Thus, profiles based on combined responses of many subjects are stable constructs."

https://openalex.org/W2008325923,"Transcription of a cloned Xenopus laevis ribosomal DNA (rDNA) fragment, microinjected into Xenopus oocytes, is initiated at the in vivo 40S pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) site (±2 bp) by RNA polymerase I. An X. laevis RNA polymerase I promoter has been mapped by studying the transcription of in vitro rDNA mutants in the oocyte system. The active promoter lies within the DNA segment beginning 145 bp upstream, and most probably ending 16 bp downstream, from the 40S pre-rRNA initiation site (−145 bp to +16 bp). Furthermore, active promoter elements lie more than 35 bp upstream from the initiation site (−35 bp). The X. laevis RNA polymerase I promoter therefore lies mainly upstream from the 40S pre-rRNA initiation site. Independent deletion of three adjacent rDNA segments lying between −61 and +16 bp reduces promoter activity by a factor of more than 16. The central of these “null” deletions removes an oligo(T)6 motif at −27 bp that is in an analogous position to the Goldberg-Hogness (TATA) box of RNA polymerase II promoters."

https://openalex.org/W2066575807,"We have analyzed the detailed structure and cytoplasmic distribution of cytoplasmic microtubule-associated proteins. The procedure used to identify these proteins, based on preparation of detergent-extracted cytoskeletons, permits separation of fractions containing assembled and unassembled microtubule proteins. We show that two of these proteins, 69 and 80 kd, are closely related to one another and that each protein is present as a set of structurally related polypeptides with differing isoelectric points. In both neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma cells, several of the isoelectric variants are greatly enriched in the fraction containing assembled microtubule components. Their differential distribution is correlated with phosphorylation at novel sites on the protein. These results support the possibility that covalent modification of a cytoskeletal component may specify its functional state."

https://openalex.org/W2099143258,"Hen ovomucoid is characterized by a high degree of microheterogeneity of its carbohydrate moieties, as was recently demonstrated by hydrazinolysis in combination with high performance liquid chromatography (Paz Parente, J., Strecker, G., Leroy, Y., Montreuil, J., and Fournet, B. (1982) J. Chromatogr., in press). This approach resulted in 17 oligosaccharide-alditol fractions; the major one could be purified to homogeneity. Primary structural analysis of this fraction was carried out by methylation analysis, partial acid hydrolysis, and 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy. Combination of these techniques enabled the unambiguous determination of a novel type of asparagine-bound carbohydrate chain: (formula, see text)."
https://openalex.org/W2015092633,"Increment-threshold spectral sensitivity functions were determined during the dominance and suppression phases of binocular rivalry. The shapes of the functions obtained during the dominance phase exhibited three maxima at approximately 440, 530, and 610 nanometers and resembled functions obtained for nonrivalrous control conditions. However, the functions measured during suppression had a single broad peak near 555 nanometers and were adequately described by functions measured with flicker methods during nonrivalrous conditions. The results indicate that binocular rivalry differentially attenuates opponent-color information relative to achromatic information."
https://openalex.org/W2092466745,"A long-standing controversy concerns whether lateralized cerebral specialization for speech and language is present at the time of language origins (developmental invariance) or whether it gradually develops from initial bilaterality (developmental progression). Thus controversy is complicated by conflicting reports of the incidence of childhood aphasia. The discrepancies are largely due to one early study. When methods for estimating speech organization distributions are applied to later studies, the developmental invariance position is supported."
https://openalex.org/W1531815877,"We have examined the effects of steroid hormones in the chromatin sensitivity of the ovalbumin gene to micrococcal nuclease and have attempted to define the importance of the nucleosome core, higher order chromatin folding, and transcription in the maintenance of the nuclease-sensitive conformation of the ovalbumin chromatin. Solution hybridization studies demonstrated that the sensitivity of the ovalbumin gene in oviduct nuclei to micrococcal nuclease paralleled the hormone-dependent transcription of the ovalbumin gene in the immature chick. Blot hybridization analysis also revealed a hormone-dependent change in this chromatin region since ovalbumin DNA fragments from nuclease-treated hen and estrogen-stimulated chick oviduct nuclei exhibited nucleosomal repeat patterns that were less discrete than those observed for the ovalbumin specific fragments from liver and hormone-withdrawn oviducts. This transcription-related conformation was not the result of enhanced sensitivity of the ovalbumin-containing nucleosomal cores since the bulk of the nucleosomes associated with the ovalbumin chromatin were not preferentially cleaved internally by micrococcal nuclease. Rather, an analysis of the fragmentation of the ovalbumin chromatin as a function of digestion extent suggested a mechanism in which the heightened sensitivity resulted from the collective expansion of the nuclease cutting sites in the linker regions of the ovalbumin chromatin because the gene was in an unfolded conformation. The transcription-specific conformation was not merely a consequence of RNA synthesis per se since the selective sensitivity of the gene was unaffected by treatment of oviduct nuclei with alpha-amanitin, actinomycin D, or RNase. In addition, the presence of the transcriptional complex on the ovalbumin chromatin was presumably not required for selective nuclease recognition since preferential cleavage was observed under conditions expected to deplete oviduct nuclei of template-bound RNA polymerase and nascent RNA chains. These results are consistent with a model in which the expressed ovalbumin gene is in an unfolded polynucleosomal structure whose formation is related to transcriptional activity but not dependent on the transcriptional process."

Both the finger movement and the spatial pattern of the surface determine this discharge in each cell. The spatial features of the surface are represented unambiguously only in the responses of populations of these neurons, and not in the responses of the constitutent cells."
https://openalex.org/W1982134582,The effect of ethanol on hippocampal axonal sprouting was studied with a histochemical technique for identifying acetylcholinesterase. Unilateral lesion of the entorhinal cortex in adult rats produced an increase in the density of acetylcholinesterase staining in the outer molecular layer and a concomitant increase in the width of the pale-staining commissural-associational zone of the dentate gyrus. Other rats were given ethanol (11.3 +/- 0.45 grams per kilogram) for 2 weeks before and 9 days after receiving the lesion. Ethanol abolished the expansion of the commissural-associated zone. The effect of ethanol on sprouting axons suggests that it may inhibit recovery of function after brain injury.

https://openalex.org/W1510268307,"A simple method is described for computer analysis of a discrete number of spots on autoradiograms from two-dimensional gels. The method involves digitizing the density data on an autoradiograph with a rotating drum densitometer and displaying the data on a graphics computer terminal. The software allows the operator to select the boundaries of the spots to be analyzed from the terminal, then integrates the the density of the spots and tabulates the data. Graphics options allow the operator to display a computer-generated image of the area of the film being analyzed. Accurate integration of weak or overlapping spots is accomplished by a nonlinear least squares fit of the density data to normal Gaussian curves in the x and y dimensions followed by analytical integration of the equations. Since the software is written in Fortran IV and the equipment required to run the programs is available in most computing centers, this technique should allow laboratories of modest resources to quantitate information from two-dimensional gels."
https://openalex.org/W1480210097,"Factor X in plasma is a gamma-carboxylated two-chain glycoprotein which, in activated form, plays a pivotal role in blood coagulation. We have utilized purified rat Factor X antibody, coupled to Sepharose, to isolate and characterize Factor X in rat liver, plasma, and hepatoma cells. Rat factor X is synthesized as a single chain precursor (Mr = 63,000). It is this form which undergoes vitamin K-dependent carboxylation in rat liver microsomes. Only after secretion is Factor X converted into its two-chain mature form. Single chain X synthesis and secretion in hepatoma cells is enhanced by vitamin K. The amount of single chain X secreted by these cells is one-half that of prothrombin. The NH2-terminal gamma-carboxylated fragments of prothrombin which induce prothrombin synthesis (Graves, C. B., Munns, T. W., Carlisle, T. L., Grant, G. A., and Strauss, A. W. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 4772-4776) also induce single chain X synthesis by hepatoma cells. We propose that synthesis of all vitamin K-dependent proteins may be regulated by this common control mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2004747965,"Photoreceptors of locust compound eyes add new receptor membrane at dusk and shed membrane at dawn. When part of an eye is masked before dusk, premature assembly of new membrane is initiated in the masked ommatidia but not in the adjacent unmasked ommatidia. Similarly, masking some ommatidia just before dawn prevents normal shedding only in the masked ommatidia. Therefore, the shedding and assembly phases of photoreceptor membrane turnover can be initiated by a change in the state of illumination of individual ommatidia."

The enzyme has an apparent Mr = 140,000. It migrates as a single band with Mr = 68,000 on electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, indicating two Mr = 68,000 subunits. Both guanine (Km = 6.0 X 10(-8) M) and queuine (KI = 9.5 X 10(-8) M) are substrates but 7-(aminomethyl)-7-deazaguanine is not. The enzyme requires a monovalent or a divalent cation; Na+ and Mg2+ are more effective activators than other cations. The optimum pH is 7.6. Six tRNA isoacceptors found in wheat germ are substrates for the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2058218156,"Microelectrode recordings were used in conjunction with antidromic activation to monitor impulse conduction along individual mammalian cerebral axons for periods of up to 165 days. Approximately half of the axons studied showed a stable conduction velocity and stable aftereffects of impulse activity. The remaining axons showed slow and progressive increases or decreases in conduction velocity overtime. In these latter axons, changes in the magnitude of the aftereffects of impulse conduction were far less pronounced than were changes in axonal conduction velocity."

https://openalex.org/W1550629884,"A high capacity F-actin affinity matrix is constructed by binding fluorescyl-actin to rabbit anti-fluorescein IgG that is covalently bound to Sepharose 4B. When stabilized with phalloidin, the actin remains associated with the Sepharose beads during repeated washes, activates the ATPase activity of myosin subfragment 1, and specifically binds 125I-heavy meromyosin and 125I-tropomyosin. The associations between the F-actin affinity matrix and the iodinated F-actin binding proteins are monitored both by affinity chromatography and by a rapid, low speed sedimentation assay. Anti-fluorescein IgG-Sepharose should be generally useful as a matrix for the immobilization of proteins containing accessible, covalently bound fluorescein groups."

https://openalex.org/W1539431389,"The effect of choline on phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis in the isolated hamster heart was investigated. Hamster hearts were perfused with [2-14C]ethanolamine in the presence of 0-0.5 mM choline. Incorporation of label into phosphatidylethanolamine was decreased 28% at 0.2-0.5 mM choline. Analysis of the ethanolamine-containing metabolites of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway revealed that choline (0.2-0.5 mM) in the perfusate had no effect on the labeling of ethanolamine. However, a 28-30% reduction in the labeling of phosphoethanolamine and CDP-ethanolamine was observed. Concurrently, there was a 2-fold increase in the intracellular choline level. Although the formation of CDP-ethanolamine is regarded as the rate-limiting step for phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis, choline was found to inhibit ethanolamine kinase, but did not have any effect on phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase. Hence, choline may provide an additional mechanism for the regulation of phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1595380565,"A new procedure is described for the reassociation of histone H1 to rat liver polynucleosomes selectively depleted of H1 and nonhistone proteins. The fidelity of reconstitution was scrutinized by nuclease digestion and sedimentation studies monitoring the regeneration of structural features which disappear following removal of H1. The results demonstrate that the 166-base pair barrier of digestion with micrococcal nuclease was restored in polynucleosomes reconstituted at the same ratio of H1 per octamer as that found in native nuclei, while association of twice that amount of H1 produced a barrier of digestion at about 178-180 base pairs. Polynucleosomes associated with polylysine exhibited a similar barrier as H1-depleted polynucleosomes. Digestion of H1-reconstituted polynucleosomes with DNase I produced preferentially dinucleosomal DNA fragments in the same manner as that of untreated polynucleosomes. The rate of digestion of H1-reconstituted polynucleosomes by micrococcal nuclease and DNase I was also comparable to that of untreated polynucleosomes. Sedimentation of H1-reconstituted polynucleosomes in a quasi-physiological ionic milieu revealed the regeneration of disassembly-refractory particles, a structural feature of untreated polynucleosomes. We conclude that the nucleosomal and supra-nucleosomal structure of polynucleosomes was reconstituted with fidelity."

https://openalex.org/W1487126097,"alpha-Iminoglutarate has long been postulated as an obligatory intermediate in the glutamate dehydrogenase catalyzed reaction, but direct proof of its participation is lacking. We report here the glutamate dehydrogenase catalyzed reduction of delta 1-pyrroline-2-carboxylic acid (a cyclic-alpha-imino acid) to proline (an alpha-amino acid). The catalysis occurs at the normal catalytic site of the enzyme. The imine and the enzyme-NADPH complex are the active oxidant and reductant, respectively. The latter is about 500 times more reactive than NADPH itself. These findings provide direct evidence that the glutamate dehydrogenase catalyzed reaction does indeed proceed by way of an enzyme-bound form of an alpha-iminocarboxylic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2024190901,Female athymic nude mice and their phenotypically normal littermates were exposed transplacentally to ethylnitrosourea. Skin tumors (papillomas and sebaceous adenomas) developed on the nude mice with an almost tenfold greater incidence than on their haired littermates. Skin tumors were also induced on nude mice but not haired controls by direct intraperitoneal treatment with ethylnitrosourea. These results indicate that nude mice have higher than normal susceptibility to carcinogenesis under some circumstances.
