https://openalex.org/W2613613983,"Most small molecules are unable to rapidly traverse the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and accumulate inside these cells, making the discovery of much-needed drugs against these pathogens challenging. Current understanding of the physicochemical properties that dictate small-molecule accumulation in Gram-negative bacteria is largely based on retrospective analyses of antibacterial agents, which suggest that polarity and molecular weight are key factors. Here we assess the ability of over 180 diverse compounds to accumulate in Escherichia coli. Computational analysis of the results reveals major differences from the retrospective studies, namely that the small molecules that are most likely to accumulate contain an amine, are amphiphilic and rigid, and have low globularity. These guidelines were then applied to convert deoxynybomycin, a natural product that is active only against Gram-positive organisms, into an antibiotic with activity against a diverse panel of multi-drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. We anticipate that these findings will aid in the discovery and development of antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2613179652,"Technology utilizing human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) has enormous potential to provide improved cellular models of human disease. However, variable genetic and phenotypic characterization of many existing iPS cell lines limits their potential use for research and therapy. Here we describe the systematic generation, genotyping and phenotyping of 711 iPS cell lines derived from 301 healthy individuals by the Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Initiative. Our study outlines the major sources of genetic and phenotypic variation in iPS cells and establishes their suitability as models of complex human traits and cancer. Through genome-wide profiling we find that 5-46% of the variation in different iPS cell phenotypes, including differentiation capacity and cellular morphology, arises from differences between individuals. Additionally, we assess the phenotypic consequences of genomic copy-number alterations that are repeatedly observed in iPS cells. In addition, we present a comprehensive map of common regulatory variants affecting the transcriptome of human pluripotent cells."

However, its primary molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood in plants and animals. Here we report unique Ca2+ signalling triggered by nitrate with live imaging of an ultrasensitive biosensor in Arabidopsis leaves and roots. A nitrate-sensitized and targeted functional genomic screen identifies subgroup III Ca2+-sensor protein kinases (CPKs) as master regulators that orchestrate primary nitrate responses. A chemical switch with the engineered mutant CPK10(M141G) circumvents embryo lethality and enables conditional analyses of cpk10 cpk30 cpk32 triple mutants to define comprehensive nitrate-associated regulatory and developmental programs. Nitrate-coupled CPK signalling phosphorylates conserved NIN-LIKE PROTEIN (NLP) transcription factors to specify the reprogramming of gene sets for downstream transcription factors, transporters, nitrogen assimilation, carbon/nitrogen metabolism, redox, signalling, hormones and proliferation. Conditional cpk10 cpk30 cpk32 and nlp7 mutants similarly impair nitrate-stimulated system-wide shoot growth and root establishment. The nutrient-coupled Ca2+ signalling network integrates transcriptome and cellular metabolism with shoot-root coordination and developmental plasticity in shaping organ biomass and architecture."
https://openalex.org/W2613102394,"The selective coupling of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to specific G proteins is critical to trigger the appropriate physiological response. However, the determinants of selective binding have remained elusive. Here we reveal the existence of a selectivity barcode (that is, patterns of amino acids) on each of the 16 human G proteins that is recognized by distinct regions on the approximately 800 human receptors. Although universally conserved positions in the barcode allow the receptors to bind and activate G proteins in a similar manner, different receptors recognize the unique positions of the G-protein barcode through distinct residues, like multiple keys (receptors) opening the same lock (G protein) using non-identical cuts. Considering the evolutionary history of GPCRs allows the identification of these selectivity-determining residues. These findings lay the foundation for understanding the molecular basis of coupling selectivity within individual receptors and G proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2612504410,"The heterogeneity of cellular states in cancer has been linked to drug resistance, cancer progression and the presence of cancer cells with properties of normal tissue stem cells. Secreted Wnt signals maintain stem cells in various epithelial tissues, including in lung development and regeneration. Here we show that mouse and human lung adenocarcinomas display hierarchical features with two distinct subpopulations, one with high Wnt signalling activity and another forming a niche that provides the Wnt ligand. The Wnt responder cells showed increased tumour propagation ability, suggesting that these cells have features of normal tissue stem cells. Genetic perturbation of Wnt production or signalling suppressed tumour progression. Small-molecule inhibitors targeting essential posttranslational modification of Wnt reduced tumour growth and markedly decreased the proliferative potential of lung cancer cells, leading to improved survival of tumour-bearing mice. These results indicate that strategies for disrupting pathways that maintain stem-like and niche cell phenotypes can translate into effective anti-cancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2612222797,"Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are a cause of stroke and seizure for which no effective medical therapies yet exist. CCMs arise from the loss of an adaptor complex that negatively regulates MEKK3-KLF2/4 signalling in brain endothelial cells, but upstream activators of this disease pathway have yet to be identified. Here we identify endothelial Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the gut microbiome as critical stimulants of CCM formation. Activation of TLR4 by Gram-negative bacteria or lipopolysaccharide accelerates CCM formation, and genetic or pharmacologic blockade of TLR4 signalling prevents CCM formation in mice. Polymorphisms that increase expression of the TLR4 gene or the gene encoding its co-receptor CD14 are associated with higher CCM lesion burden in humans. Germ-free mice are protected from CCM formation, and a single course of antibiotics permanently alters CCM susceptibility in mice. These studies identify unexpected roles for the microbiome and innate immune signalling in the pathogenesis of a cerebrovascular disease, as well as strategies for its treatment."

Brain abnormalities in white matter, cortical and deep grey matter and cerebellum and brain growth were scored on T1- and T2-weighted TEA-MRI using the Kidokoro scoring system. Neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed at two years corrected age using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, third edition. The association between TEA-MRI and perinatal factors as well as neurodevelopmental outcome was evaluated using multivariable regression analysis.The distribution of brain abnormalities and brain metrics in the Utrecht cohort differed from the original St. Louis cohort (p < .05). Mechanical ventilation >7 days (β [95% confidence interval, CI]: 1.3 [.5; 2.0]) and parenteral nutrition >21 days (2.2 [1.2; 3.2]) were independently associated with higher global brain abnormality scores (p < .001). Global brain abnormality scores were inversely associated with cognitive (β in composite scores [95% CI]: -.7 [-1.2; -.2], p = .004), fine motor (β in scaled scores [95% CI]: -.1 [-.3; -.0], p = .007) and gross motor outcome (β in scaled scores [95% CI]: -.2 [-.3; -.1], p < .001) at two years corrected age, although the explained variances were low (R2 ≤.219).Patterns of brain injury differed between cohorts. Prolonged mechanical ventilation and parenteral nutrition were identified as independent perinatal risk factors. The prognostic value of the TEA-MRI score was rather limited in this well-performing cohort."

Relatively low levels of N-glycans are found on transmembrane mucins, and their structure and function remain poorly characterized. We previously reported that carbohydrate-dependent interactions of transmembrane mucins with galectin-3 contribute to maintenance of the epithelial barrier at the ocular surface. Now, using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, we report that transmembrane mucin N-glycans in differentiated human corneal epithelial cells contain primarily complex-type structures with N-acetyllactosamine, a preferred galectin ligand. In N-glycosylation inhibition experiments, we find that treatment with tunicamycin and siRNA-mediated knockdown of the Golgi N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I gene (MGAT1) induce partial loss of both total and cell-surface levels of the largest mucin, MUC16, and a concomitant reduction in glycocalyx barrier function. Moreover, we identified a distinct role for N-glycans in promoting MUC16's binding affinity toward galectin-3 and in causing retention of the lectin on the epithelial cell surface. Taken together, these studies define a role for N-linked oligosaccharides in supporting the stability and function of transmembrane mucins on mucosal surfaces.

Energy-rich diets in rodents are commonly studied models of compensatory increases in both insulin secretion and β cell mass. However, the mechanisms of these adaptive responses are incompletely understood, and it is also unclear why these responses eventually fail. We measured the temporal trends of glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion, β cell morphometry, and islet gene expression in C57BL/6NTac mice fed a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) or control diet for up to 16 weeks. A 2-fold increased hyperinsulinemia was maintained for the first 4 weeks of HFD feeding and then further increased through 16 weeks. β cell mass increased progressively starting at 4 weeks, principally through nonproliferative growth. Insulin sensitivity was not significantly perturbed until 11 weeks of HFD feeding. Over the first 8 weeks, we observed two distinct waves of increased expression of β cell functional and prodifferentiation genes. This was followed by activation of the unfolded protein response at 8 weeks and overt β cell endoplasmic reticulum stress at 12–16 weeks. In summary, β cell adaptation to an HFD in C57BL/6NTac mice entails early insulin hypersecretion and a robust growth phase along with hyperexpression of related genes that begin well before the onset of observed insulin resistance. However, continued HFD exposure results in cessation of gene hyperexpression, β cell functional failure, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. These data point to a complex but not sustainable integration of β cell-adaptive responses to nutrient overabundance, obesity development, and insulin resistance.

https://openalex.org/W2612572443,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by progressive pulmonary scarring, decline in lung function, and often results in death within 3–5 five years after diagnosis. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of IPF; however, the mechanism through which FGF signaling contributes to pulmonary fibrosis remains unclear. We hypothesized that FGF receptor (FGFR) signaling in fibroblasts is required for the fibrotic response to bleomycin. To test this, mice with mesenchyme-specific tamoxifen-inducible inactivation of FGF receptors 1, 2, and 3 (Col1α2-CreER; TCKO mice) were lineage labeled and administered intratracheal bleomycin. Lungs were collected for histologic analysis, whole lung RNA and protein, and dissociated for flow cytometry and FACS. Bleomycin-treated Col1α2-CreER; TCKO mice have decreased pulmonary fibrosis, collagen production, and fewer α-smooth muscle actin-positive (αSMA+) myofibroblasts compared with controls. Freshly isolated Col1α2-CreER; TCKO mesenchymal cells from bleomycin-treated mice have decreased collagen expression compared with wild type mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, lineage labeled FGFR-deficient fibroblasts have decreased enrichment in fibrotic areas and decreased proliferation. These data identify a cell autonomous requirement for mesenchymal FGFR signaling in the development of pulmonary fibrosis, and for the enrichment of the Col1α2-CreER-positive (Col1α2+) mesenchymal lineage in fibrotic tissue following bleomycin exposure. We conclude that mesenchymal FGF signaling is required for the development of pulmonary fibrosis, and that therapeutic strategies aimed directly at mesenchymal FGF signaling could be beneficial in the treatment of IPF.

Simultaneous deletion of multiple FGF receptors was performed due to overlapping receptor specificity of many FGFs, including FGF1, FGF2, and FGF9 (22.Ornitz D.M. Itoh N.

In this report we demonstrate that the Col1α2+ lineage is enriched in fibrotic tissue following bleomycin treatment, and that cell-autonomous FGFR signaling is required for this lineage enrichment. Deletion of FGFRs in lung mesenchyme decreases collagen expression and the development of pulmonary fibrosis in response to bleomycin. Our data suggests that inhibition of FGFR signaling pathways in fibroblasts slows the enrichment of lung mesenchyme into injured areas, providing a mechanistic rationale for the use of FGF inhibitors to slow the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. Mesenchymal cells were genetically tagged with a membrane-localized green fluorescent protein (GFP) by mating Col1α2-CreER mice with ROSA26mTmG Cre reporter mice (23.Muzumdar M.D. Tasic B.

Tamoxifen treatment of Col1α2-CreER; ROSA26mTmG/+ mice from postnatal day 21 (P21) to P35 labels peribronchiolar smooth muscle and fibroblasts, perivascular smooth muscle, and interstitial fibroblasts (Fig. 1, A and B). Co-immunofluorescence for GFP and PDGFRα reveals that interstitial fibroblasts targeted by Col1α2-CreER are PDGFRα+ (Fig. 1C). Col1α2+ (GFP+) mesenchymal cells also express periostin and α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) (Fig. 1, D and E), but not s100a4 (not shown) and epithelial-specific proteins such as pro-surfactant protein C (pro-SPC) (Fig. 1F). In response to bleomycin, lung mesenchymal cells targeted by Col1α2-CreER were enriched in areas of fibrosis as early as 14 days post-bleomycin treatment (Fig. 1, G and H). Col1α2+ cells in areas of fibrosis express αSMA (Fig. 1I), although not all αSMA+ cells in fibrotic areas were GFP+. Col1α2+ cells make up 3.97 ± 0.54% (n = 8) of all single cells from Col1α2-CreER; ROSA26mTmG/+ mice treated with tamoxifen (Fig. 2, A–D), and 32% of CD45, CD31, EpCAM (Lin-negative) cells (Fig. 2G). Very few Col1α2+ cells are found in the Lin-positive population (Fig. 2F). GFP+ cells were collected from tamoxifen-treated mouse lungs by cell sorting, and expression of mesenchymal-specific genes was measured using quantitative RT-PCR and normalized to GAPDH and whole lung expression. Col1α2+ mesenchymal cells were highly enriched for Col1α1, Col1α2, Acta2, Periostin, and PDGFRα (Fig. 2H). Fgfr1 is expressed in mesenchymal cells and fibroblasts (22.Ornitz D.M. Itoh N.

In IPF, expression of FGFRs 1–3 is increased in myofibroblasts (11.MacKenzie B. Korfei M. Henneke I. Sibinska Z. Tian X. Hezel S. Dilai S. Wasnick R. Schneider B. Wilhelm J. El Agha E. Klepetko W. Seeger W. Schermuly R. Günther A. Bellusci S. Increased FGF1-FGFRc expression in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.Respir. Res. 2015; 16: 83Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To determine the potential for redundant function of Fgfr2, Fgfr3, and Fgfr4 in mesenchymal cells and fibroblasts, we measured Fgfr expression in freshly isolated (non-cultured) Col1α2+ mesenchymal cells. Analysis of Fgfr expression showed that Fgfr1 is the predominant FGF receptor expressed in Col1α2+ cells. Fgfr2, Fgfr3, and Fgfr4 were expressed at ∼16-, 2.15-, and 2.82-fold lower levels than Fgfr1, respectively (Fig. 2I). When Col1α2+ mesenchymal cells were cultured on collagen-coated dishes, Fgfr1 remained the most abundant FGFR, however, expression of Fgfr2 and Fgfr3 was significantly diminished by passage number 2, and there was little measurable Fgfr4 expression (Fig. 2J). These data indicate that to completely inhibit FGF signaling in lung mesenchyme in vivo, deletion of multiple FGFRs is necessary, as they are capable of compensatory signaling if only Fgfr1 is deleted. Given significant expression of multiple FGF receptors in lung mesenchyme in vivo, we generated mesenchyme-specific knock-out of Fgfrs 1, 2, and 3 using the Col1α2-CreER allele. Col1α2-CreER mice were crossed with Fgfr1f/f; Fgfr2f/f; Fgfr3f/f triple flox mice (Fgfr1/2/3 TFF). Successful generation of Col1α2-CreER; Fgfr1/2/3 TFF mice was confirmed by PCR (Fig. 3A). Treatment of Col1α2-CreER; Fgfr1/2/3 TFF mice with tamoxifen from P21 to P35 generated triple conditional knock-out mice (Col1α2-CreER; TCKO) with significant reduction in Fgfr-1, -2, and -3 expression in freshly sorted Col1α2+ mesenchymal cells (Fig. 3B). Expression of Fgfr4 was unchanged in Col1α2-CreER; TCKO mice (Fig. 3B). Baseline expression, as expressed by ΔCt, of mesenchymal-specific genes such as Col1α1, Col1α2, Col3α1, Fibronectin, Pdgfra, α-smooth muscle actin (Acta2), Periostin (Postn), Lysyl oxidase (Lox), s100a4, and connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf) were also unchanged in freshly sorted Col1α2-CreER; TCKO mesenchyme compared with controls (Fig. 3C). The predominant mesenchymal genes expressed in freshly sorted Col1α2+ cells were Col1α1 and Col3α1 (Fig. 3C). To determine whether lung mesenchyme from Col1α2-CreER; TCKO mice have deficient FGF signaling, sorted GFP+ cells (Col1α2+ lineage) from tamoxifen-treated Col1α2-CreER; TCKO; ROSA26mTmG/+ and Col1α2-CreER; ROSA26mTmG/+ mice were cultured and administered recombinant FGF2 (2 nm) for 48 h. Col1α2-CreER; TCKO mesenchymal cells have decreased expression of FGF-dependent genes Etv4 and Spry2 at baseline and in response to FGF2 (Fig. 4, A and B). Additionally, Etv4 expression was significantly decreased in whole lung RNA and in RNA from freshly sorted GFP+ cells from bleomycin-treated Col1α2-CreER; TCKO; ROSA26mTmG/+ mice compared with controls (Fig. 4, C and D). Western blot analysis from whole-lung protein lysates demonstrated decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in bleomycin-treated Col1α2-CreER; TCKO mice compared with controls (Fig. 5, A and B). Additionally, co-immunofluorescence for phosphorylated ERK1/2 and GFP demonstrated decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 overall and in GFP+ cells (Fig. 5, C–J) in bleomycin-treated Col1α2-CreER; TCKO; ROSA26mTmG/+ mice compared with Col1α2-CreER; ROSA26mTmG/+ controls, indicating decreased FGFR-dependent activation of p42/44 MAPK pathways. These data show that mesenchymal cells from Col1α2-CreER; TCKO mice have deficient FGF-induced signaling and gene expression.Figure 5Decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in Col1a2-CreER; TCKO mice. Col1α2-CreER; TCKO and control Fgfr1/2/3 TFF mice were administered a single dose of intratracheal bleomycin (1.2 units/kg) or PBS. Total protein was isolated from whole lungs 21 days post-bleomycin, and analyzed by Western blotting for phosphorylated ERK1/2, total ERK1/2, and tubulin (A). Densitometric analysis was performed on n = 3–4 replicates, and pERK1/2:total ERK1/2 ratios were normalized to tubulin and expressed as fold-change from PBS-treated Fgfr1/2/3 TFF control mice (B). * indicates p < 0.05.

Col1α2-CreER; TCKO mice had attenuated weight loss post-bleomycin (Fig. 6A) and improved survival (Fig. 6B). Histologic analysis revealed significantly decreased bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in Col1α2-CreER; TCKO mice compared with triple flox/flox (TFF) controls 21 days after bleomycin on H&E-stained sections (Fig. 6D), by Ashcroft scoring (Fig. 6C), and on Masson trichrome-stained sections (Fig. 6F). Quantitative hydroxyproline measurements revealed decreased collagen deposition in Col1α2-CreER; TCKO mice 21 days post-bleomycin (Fig. 6E). There was no difference in histologic fibrosis or hydroxyproline content between Cre-negative TFF controls and mice containing only Col1α2-CreER (Cre controls) in response to bleomycin (not shown). To test whether mesenchyme-specific deletion of FGFRs is required for bleomycin-induced expansion of myofibroblasts, lungs from Col1α2-CreER; TCKO and Col1α2-CreER control mice treated with intratracheal bleomycin were enzymatically dissociated 14 days after bleomycin, fixed, permeabilized, stained with A647-conjugated antibodies against αSMA, and analyzed via flow cytometry. Compared with controls, Col1α2-CreER; TCKO mice had fewer bleomycin-induced αSMA+ cells (Fig. 6G), indicating decreased numbers of myofibroblasts in mice lacking mesenchymal Fgfrs-1, -2, and -3. To determine whether bleomycin-induced expression of collagen and other pro-fibrotic genes were altered in Col1α2-CreER; TCKO mice, whole lung mRNA was collected 21 days after bleomycin treatment. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed decreased expression of collagen genes Col1α1 and Col3α1 in Col1α2-CreER; TCKO mice compared with TFF controls (Fig. 7, A and B). No significant difference in Col1α2 was measured between bleomycin-treated control and TCKO mice, although control mice, but not TCKO mice, demonstrated a significant increase in Col1α2 expression in response to bleomycin compared with PBS treatment (Fig. 7C). Col1α2-CreER; TCKO mice had decreased bleomycin-induced expression of several pro-fibrotic genes compared with controls, including Ctgf, Lox, and Serpine-1a (Pai1) (Fig. 7, D–F). There was no significant difference in expression of Postn, IL-6, vimentin, or fibronectin in bleomycin-treated Col1α2-CreER; TCKO mice compared with Fgfr1/2/3 TFF controls (Fig. 7, G and H, and data not shown). We then tested whether there was cell-autonomous FGFR-dependent gene expression in lung mesenchyme following bleomycin treatment. Col1α2-CreER; TCKO; ROSA26mTmG/+ and Col1α2-CreER; ROSA26mTmG/+ mice were administered intratracheal bleomycin, and lungs were dissociated for cell sorting 21 days post-bleomycin. GFP+ cells were sorted directly into RNA lysis buffer, and analyzed by qRT-PCR. Freshly sorted GFP+ cells from bleomycin-treated Col1α2-CreER; TCKO; ROSA26mTmG/+ mice have decreased Col1a1 expression compared with Col1α2-CreER; ROSA26mTmG/+ controls (Fig. 8A), but unchanged Col3α1, Col1α2, and Ctgf expression (Fig. 8, B–D). GFP+ TCKO cells had decreased Col3α1 expression following PBS treatment (Fig. 8B), and no significant change in Lox and Pai1 expression (Fig. 8, E and F). GFP+ cells from control mice, but not TCKO mice, demonstrated a significant increase in Lox and Pai1 expression in response to bleomycin compared with PBS treatment (Fig. 8, E and F). Additionally, GFP+ cells from Col1α2-CreER; TCKO; ROSA26mTmG/+ mice had significantly decreased bleomycin-induced Postn expression (Fig. 8G), and an attenuated reduction in Pdgfra in response to bleomycin (Fig. 8H). Freshly sorted GFP+ cells from Col1α2-CreER; TCKO; ROSA26mTmG/+ and Col1α2-CreER; ROSA26mTmG/+ mice were also cultured, serum-starved, and treated with 2 ng/ml of TGF-β1 for 48 h. GFP+ TCKO mesenchymal cells show reduced Col1α1 expression compared with controls in response to TGF-β1 (Fig. 9A), but unchanged phosphorylation of Smad2 (Fig. 9, B and C). We observed fewer GFP+ cells in bleomycin-treated Col1α2-CreER; TCKO; ROSA26mTmG/+ lungs, as seen in Fig. 5, G–J, and hypothesized that the mechanism by which Col1α2-CreER; TCKO mice have decreased fibrosis and myofibroblasts after bleomycin injury is through impaired lineage expansion of Col1α2+ mesenchyme into areas of fibrosis. To test this, Col1α2-CreER; TCKO; ROSA26mTmG/+ and Col1α2-CreER; ROSA26mTmG/+ control mice were provided a 4-week washout period post-tamoxifen, and administered intratracheal PBS or bleomycin. The Col1α2+ lineage was initially evaluated using GFP immunofluorescence and co-localization with αSMA 21 days post-bleomycin (Fig. 10, A–H). In bleomycin-treated Col1α2-CreER; TCKO; ROSA26mTmG/+ mice, there were fewer GFP+ cells in fibrotic areas, and fewer αSMA+ cells throughout the lungs compared with controls (Fig. 10, A–E, also see Figs. 5, C–J, and 6G). To better determine αSMA+ expression in GFP+ TCKO mesenchymal cells, dissociated lungs from bleomycin-treated Col1α2-CreER; TCKO; ROSA26mTmG/+ and Col1α2-CreER; ROSA26mTmG/+ mice were stained with A647-conjugated anti-αSMA antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry. PBS-treated TCKO mice had unaltered abundance of αSMA+ cells in both GFP+ and GFP− populations (Fig. 10, I and J). Following bleomycin treatment, there were fewer αSMA+, GFP− cells in TCKO mice but unchanged αSMA+, GFP+ cells in TCKO lungs compared with controls (Fig. 10, I and J), suggesting an indirect effect of FGFR signaling on αSMA expression following bleomycin. To quantify the abundance of GFP-labeled mesenchymal cells in Col1α2-CreER; TCKO; ROSA26mTmG/+ mouse lungs compared with controls, GFP immunohistochemistry in areas with similar amounts of fibrosis were compared. The Col1α2+ lineage had decreased enrichment in areas of fibrosis following bleomycin in TCKO mice (Fig. 11, A–C). Additionally, the overall abundance of GFP+ cells, as a percentage of total lung single cells detected using flow cytometry, was decreased in TCKO mice compared with controls (Fig. 11D). The overall abundance of GFP+ cells did not significantly increase following bleomycin compared with PBS controls (not shown), consistent with prior reports (24.Tsukui T. Ueha S. Abe J. Hashimoto S. Shichino S. Shimaoka T. Shand F.H. Arakawa Y. Oshima K. Hattori M. Inagaki Y. Tomura M. Matsushima K. Qualitative rather than quantitative changes are hallmarks of fibroblasts in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.Am. J. Pathol. 2013; 183: 758-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We then assessed proliferation in response to bleomycin in TCKO mice by EdU labeling prior to lung collection, enzymatic dissociation, and cell sorting. Col1α2-CreER; TCKO mice have decreased numbers of EdU+ cells within the overall single cell population and in the Lin-neg mesenchymal population (Fig. 11, E and F), demonstrating decreased proliferation in mesenchyme after bleomycin-induced injury. We then measured growth in cultures of Lin-neg, GFP+ cells isolated from Col1α2-CreER; TCKO; ROSA26mTmG/+ and control Col1α2-CreER; ROSA26mTmG/+ mice 21 days after bleomycin. Compared with controls, Col1α2-CreER; TCKO; ROSA26mTmG/+ mesenchymal cells demonstrate decreased growth over a 9-day period (Fig. 11G). This demonstrates that FGFR signaling is required for proliferation and expansion of a pre-existing mesenchymal population that contributes to bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. In this report, we demonstrate that FGFRs-1, -2, and -3 in Col1α2+ lung mesenchyme and fibroblasts are required for bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and collagen production. Furthermore, we showed that FGFR signaling is required for bleomycin-induced collagen expression in freshly isolated fibroblasts. Additionally, intact FGFR signaling in lung mesenchyme is required for lineage-specific expansion of fibrotic tissue in response to bleomycin. FGF signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, as non-"
https://openalex.org/W2614020683,"Primary cilia play central roles in signaling during metazoan development. Several key regulators of ciliogenesis and ciliary signaling are mutated in humans, resulting in a number of ciliopathies, including Joubert syndrome (JS). ARL13B is a ciliary GTPase with at least three missense mutations identified in JS patients. ARL13B is a member of the ADP ribosylation factor family of regulatory GTPases, but is atypical in having a non-homologous, C-terminal domain of ∼20 kDa and at least one key residue difference in the consensus GTP-binding motifs. For these reasons, and to establish a solid biochemical basis on which to begin to model its actions in cells and animals, we developed preparations of purified, recombinant, murine Arl13b protein. We report results from assays for solution-based nucleotide binding, intrinsic and GTPase-activating protein-stimulated GTPase, and ARL3 guanine nucleotide exchange factor activities. Biochemical analyses of three human missense mutations found in JS and of two consensus GTPase motifs reinforce the atypical properties of this regulatory GTPase. We also discovered that murine Arl13b is a substrate for casein kinase 2, a contaminant in our preparation from human embryonic kidney cells. This activity, and the ability of casein kinase 2 to use GTP as a phosphate donor, may be a source of differences between our data and previously published results. These results provide a solid framework for further research into ARL13B on which to develop models for the actions of this clinically important cell regulator."
https://openalex.org/W2612033471,"Asexual spores (conidia) are reproductive structures that play a crucial role in fungal distribution and survival. As fungal conidia are, in most cases, etiological agents of plant diseases and fungal lung disease, their stress resistance and interaction with their hosts have drawn increasing attention. In the present study, we investigated whether environmental temperature during conidiation affects the stress tolerance of the conidia of the human pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. Conidia from a 25°C culture showed a lower tolerance to heat (60°C) and oxidative (H2O2) stresses and a marked resistance to ultraviolet radiation exposure, compared with those produced at 37 and 45°C. The accumulation of trehalose was lower in the conidia from the 25°C culture. Furthermore, the conidia from the 25°C culture showed darker pigmentation and increased transcripts of dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin biosynthesis-related genes (i.e., pksP, arp1, and arp2). An RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that the transcription level of the trypacidin (tpc) gene cluster, which contains 13 genes, was sharply and coordinately activated in the conidia from the 25°C culture. Accordingly, trypacidin was abundant in the conidia from the 25°C culture, whereas there was little trypacidin in the conidia from the 37°C culture. Taken together, these data show that the environmental temperature during conidiation affects conidial properties such as stress tolerance, pigmentation, and mycotoxin accumulation. To enhance our knowledge, we further explored the temperature-dependent production of DHN-melanin and trypacidin in clinical A. fumigatus isolates. Some of the isolates showed temperature-independent production of DHN-melanin and/or trypacidin, indicating that the conidia-associated secondary metabolisms differed among the isolates."

Dysregulation of the alternative splicing of tau exon 10 results in alterations of the ratio of two tau isoforms, 3R-tau and 4R-tau, which have been seen in several tauopathies. Transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) is involved in the regulation of RNA processing, including splicing. Cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43 has been observed in the brains of individuals with chronic traumatic encephalopathy or Alzheimer's disease, diseases in which neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau are hallmarks. Here, we investigated the role of TDP-43 in tau exon 10 splicing. We found that TDP-43 promoted tau exon 10 inclusion, which increased production of the 4R-tau isoform. Moreover, TDP-43 could bind to intron 9 of tau pre-mRNA. Deletion of the TDP-43 N or C terminus promoted its cytoplasmic aggregation and abolished or diminished TDP-43-promoted tau exon 10 inclusion. Several TDP-43 mutations associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin inclusions promoted tau exon 10 inclusion more effectively than wild-type TDP-43 but did not affect TDP-43 cytoplasmic aggregation in cultured cells. The ratio of 3R-tau/4R-tau was decreased in transgenic mouse brains expressing human TDP-43 and increased in the brains expressing the disease-causing mutation TDP-43M337V, in which cytoplasmic TDP-43 was increased. These findings suggest that TDP-43 promotes tau exon 10 inclusion and 4R-tau expression and that disease-related changes of TDP-43, truncations and mutations, affect its function in tau exon 10 splicing, possibly because of TDP-43 mislocalization to the cytoplasm.

https://openalex.org/W2612230422,"This study examines the influence of competition on the financial stability of the commercial banks of Association of Southeast Asian Nation (ASEAN) over the 1990 to 2014 period. Panzar-Rosse H-statistic, Lerner index and Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) are used as measures of competition, while Z-score, non-performing loan (NPL) ratio and equity ratio are used as measures of financial stability. Two-step system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimates demonstrate that competition measured by H-statistic is positively related to Z-score and equity ratio, and negatively related to non-performing loan ratio. Conversely, market power measured by Lerner index is negatively related to Z-score and equity ratio and positively related to NPL ratio. These results strongly support the competition-stability view for ASEAN banks. We also capture the non-linear relationship between competition and financial stability by incorporating a quadratic term of competition in our models. The results show that the coefficient of the quadratic term of H-statistic is negative for the Z-score model given a positive coefficient of the linear term in the same model. These results support the non-linear relationship between competition and financial stability of the banking sector. The study contains significant policy implications for improving the financial stability of the commercial banks."
https://openalex.org/W2613818575,"Upon infection, the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii co-opts critical functions of its host cell to avoid immune clearance and gain access to nutritional resources. One route by which Toxoplasma co-opts its host cell is through hijacking host organelles, many of which have roles in immunomodulation. Here we demonstrate that Toxoplasma infection results in increased biogenesis of host lipid droplets through rewiring of multiple components of host neutral lipid metabolism. These metabolic changes cause increased responsiveness of host cells to free fatty acid, leading to a radical increase in the esterification of free fatty acids into triacylglycerol. We identified c-Jun kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) as components of two distinct host signaling pathways that modulate the parasite-induced lipid droplet accumulation. We also found that, unlike many host processes dysregulated during Toxoplasma infection, the induction of lipid droplet generation is conserved not only during infection with genetically diverse Toxoplasma strains but also with Neospora caninum, which is closely related to Toxoplasma but has a restricted host range and uses different effector proteins to alter host signaling. Finally, by showing that a Toxoplasma strain deficient in exporting a specific class of effectors is unable to induce lipid droplet accumulation, we demonstrate that the parasite plays an active role in this process. These results indicate that, despite their different host ranges, Toxoplasma and Neospora use a conserved mechanism to co-opt these host organelles, which suggests that lipid droplets play a critical role at the coccidian host-pathogen interface.

LDs have also been implicated as major players in host-pathogen interaction. Indeed, LDs represent energy-rich prizes for intracellular pathogens. For instance, Chlamydia takes up host lipids by trafficking LDs to the bacterial inclusion (6Cocchiaro J.L. Kumar Y. Fischer E.R. Hackstadt T. Valdivia R.H.

Toxoplasma effector MAF1 mediates recruitment of host mitochondria and impacts the host response.PLoS Biol. 2014; 12: e1001845Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In some parasite strains, a polymorphic parasite effector serves to capture host mitochondria against the PV (18Pernas L. Adomako-Ankomah Y. Shastri A.J. Ewald S.E. Treeck M. Boyle J.P.

Toxoplasma effector MAF1 mediates recruitment of host mitochondria and impacts the host response.PLoS Biol. 2014; 12: e1001845Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), resulting in apparent changes in immune signaling. It is therefore likely that additional effectors directly modulate the functions of other host organelles. Recent work indicates that LDs accumulate in Toxoplasma-infected murine cells (19Mota L.A. Roberto Neto J. Monteiro V.G. Lobato C.S. Oliveira M.A. Cunha Md. D'Ávila H. Seabra S.H. Bozza P.T. DaMatta R.A.

Vectors. 2014; 7: 47Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), although neither the signaling nor the metabolic changes to the host cell associated with this organellar modulation are understood. Here we demonstrate that Toxoplasma infection radically alters its host cell metabolism, changing how the cells respond to and process fatty acids. These changes result in buildup of neutral lipids in LDs, some of which appear to be captured by the PV. We identify multiple biochemical activities involved in neutral lipid metabolism that are altered by infection and show that these processes are similarly affected by Neospora infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this metabolic dysregulation requires secretion of parasite effectors, revealing host LDs as a previously unknown platform for coccidian parasite interaction with their hosts. Previous work has indicated that Toxoplasma infection induces an increase in murine host LDs (19Mota L.A. Roberto Neto J. Monteiro V.G. Lobato C.S. Oliveira M.A. Cunha Md. D'Ávila H. Seabra S.H.

Vectors. 2014; 7: 47Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To confirm that this phenomenon is relevant to hosts other than mice, we infected primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) with the type I RH strain of parasites expressing cytosolic TdTomato. After 24 h, we stained neutral lipids with BODIPY 493/503. Although few LDs were visible without the addition of free fatty acid (FFA) (data not shown), after incubation with oleic acid (OA), parasite-infected cells had significant neutral lipid buildup compared with uninfected cells (Fig. 1). Infection with increasing multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.) led to a more robust increase in host LDs (Fig. 1A), consistent with a dose response to a parasite-derived factor. To investigate the timing of the up-regulation, HFFs were incubated with OA for a total of 24 h and infected with Toxoplasma for 2–24 h prior to fixation and then stained and imaged (Fig. 1B) as above. Cellular neutral lipid levels were estimated by quantifying BODIPY intensity in all images using an automated CellProfiler pipeline (21Kamentsky L. Jones T.R. Fraser A. Bray M.-A. Logan D.J. Madden K.L. Ljosa V. Rueden C. Eliceiri K.W. Carpenter A.E. Improved structure, function and compatibility for CellProfiler: modular high-throughput image analysis software.Bioinformatics. 2011; 27: 1179-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). We observed significant increases in BODIPY signal as early as 2 h post infection (hpi) and more substantial differences as infection progressed. As all cells were treated with OA for the same amount of time, these data indicate that, as an infected cell matures, it increases its ability to take up, esterify, and store esterified fatty acids in LDs. We also observed a diffuse BODIPY signal associated with the parasites in OA-treated cells (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). We quantified this parasite-associated signal at 24 hpi and found that it was significantly higher than the BODIPY signal colocalized with host nuclei, which we used as an estimate of nonspecific background (Fig. 1D). This parasite-associated signal suggests that the parasites themselves store neutral lipids when exposed to high levels of FFA. To demonstrate that the observed accumulation of LDs is not an artifact of excess FFA, we tested whether LD biogenesis was altered in infected cells that had not been treated with OA. As LDs range in diameter from several microns down to ∼100 nm and often cluster within a cell, they can be difficult to resolve by light microscopy. We therefore used transmission EM to examine cells that were not treated with OA and either infected for 24 h or left uninfected. Consistent with our fluorescence microscopy data of OA-treated cells (Fig. 1), we observed an increase in overall host LD-infected cells compared with uninfected cells (Fig. 2, A–C). Overall, we observed an approximate 2-fold increase in the cellular surface area covered by LDs in infected cells over that in uninfected cells (Fig. 2D). This was partially due to a greater number of droplets in infected cells (Fig. 2E), although infected cells also contained significantly higher numbers of larger LDs (Fig. 2F). Neutral lipid synthesis machinery localizes to the ER, and current models indicate that LDs bud from sites on the ER membrane (22Barbosa A.D. Savage D.B. Siniossoglou S. Lipid droplet-organelle interactions: emerging roles in lipid metabolism.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2015; 35: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). As the Toxoplasma PV is thought to make intimate contacts with a number of host organelles, including the ER (17Sinai A.P. Webster P. Joiner K.A. Association of host cell endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria with the Toxoplasma gondii parasitophorous vacuole membrane: a high affinity interaction.J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2117-2128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that such contacts might be involved in the observed induction of neutral lipid accumulation in infected cells. If that were the case, we would expect to find concentrated groups of LDs near the PV. Although our EM images do show clusters of LDs in infected cells, we observed no correlation with distance to the PV; clusters of LDs in infected cell often localize quite distant from a PV (Fig. 2A). Strikingly, we also observed round objects of low electron density within the PV, consistent with the EM characteristics of LDs (Fig. 2C, arrowheads), suggesting that neutral lipids are being imported into the PV. LDs are composed of a variety of neutral lipids, including cholesterol esters, diacylglycerols, and triacylglycerols (TAG). To identify the neutral lipids accumulating in infected cells, at 24 hpi we extracted lipids from infected cells and compared the neutral lipid levels with those extracted from uninfected cells. As addition of FFA would be expected to drive the increase of TAG over other neutral lipids, we did not treat cells with OA. To control for lipids found in parasites, parasites were mechanically released from identically treated infected cells and purified from cell debris by filtration. These free parasites were mixed with uninfected host cells in organic solvent to extract neutral lipids. All “uninfected” samples therefore contained a mix of parasite and host-derived lipids and thus provided a true baseline against which to specifically measure changes in host neutral lipid levels because of infection. We resolved extracted neutral lipids by TLC. Quantifying individual lipid levels by densitometric comparison with lipid standards revealed that parasite infection increased TAG levels by 3-fold but that other neutral lipids, including cholesterol esters, remained largely unaltered (Fig. 3A). Taken together with our EM images, these data demonstrate that Toxoplasma infection of human cells triggers a specific up-regulation in TAG accumulation and the biogenesis of new lipid droplets. LDs are maintained in a dynamic equilibrium by continuous synthesis and hydrolysis (lipolysis) of neutral lipids (1Hashemi H.F. Goodman J.M. The life cycle of lipid droplets.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2015; 33: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The accumulation of LDs we observe in infected cells could therefore be due either to an increased rate of synthesis, due to a reduction in the rate of lipolysis, or both. We thus sought to quantify the contributions of TAG synthesis and lipolysis to Toxoplasma-induced LD accumulation. To measure the rate of lipolysis, Toxoplasma-infected and uninfected HFFs were treated with 60 μm OA to induce high levels of LD accumulation. After 16 h, OA was washed out, and 6 μm triacsin C, an inhibitor of neutral lipid synthesis, was added to the medium. By measuring the amount of cellular TAG over time, we observed no significant difference between the lipolysis rates in infected and uninfected cells (Fig. 3C), suggesting that Toxoplasma is inducing changes in biogenesis and growth, but not turnover, of host LDs. We next sought to measure the rate of LD accumulation in infected and uninfected cells. After overnight infection, HFFs were incubated with OA for 0–6 h, and cellular TAG was quantified over time as above. Consistent with our observation that infected HFFs begin accumulating host LDs shortly after infection (Fig. 1), we observed a substantially increased rate of LD accumulation in Toxoplasma-infected cells compared with uninfected controls (Fig. 3D). The increased response of infected cells to FFA stimulation could have its roots in a variety of regulatory mechanisms, from transcriptional to post-translational. We used qPCR to quantify the transcript levels of host enzymes involved in LD maintenance (Fig. 3B) at 24 hpi but without stimulation with OA (Fig. 3E). Although we observed no change in lipolysis rate because of infection, we did observe that the transcript levels for adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), which encodes the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in TAG lipolysis, were reduced by 1.9 ± 0.1-fold in infected cells. Changes in transcript levels were not limited to proteins involved in lipolysis. Most notably, we observed a 1.9 ± 0.3-fold increase in the transcript for the enzyme diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase (DGAT2), which converts DAG and FFA into TAG (23Yen C.-L. Stone S.J. Koliwad S. Harris C. Farese Jr., R.V. DGAT enzymes and triacylglycerol biosynthesis.J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 2283-2301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar), as well as a 5.9 ± 0.8-fold increase in the fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5), which is required for efficient transport of FFA between organellar membranes. Consistent with the increase in its transcript, FABP5 protein levels were substantially increased in infected cells (Fig. 3F). Increased levels of FABP5 protein would be expected to bind FFA, potentially increasing the amount of FFA available in a cell. We quantified FFA levels from our lipid extractions (e.g. Fig. 3A) by densitometry and found that infected cells had 2.2 ± 0.4-fold more FFA than uninfected cells (Fig. 3G). We also tested whether infection increased FFA import into a cell using radiolabeled OA but saw no significant difference between uptake in infected versus uninfected cells (Fig. 3H). These data are consistent with the known role of FABP5 in intracellular FFA transport rather than in import. Taken together, these data suggest that the parasite-driven increase in host LD accumulation is caused, in part, by changes in transcripts that encode for proteins involved in both the intracellular transport and synthesis of lipids. Given the multiple layers of regulation of cellular metabolism, it is unlikely that transcriptional changes are entirely responsible for the observed changes in LD accumulation upon infection. We went on to quantify the DGAT activity in uninfected and Toxoplasma-infected cells according to the method described under “Experimental procedures.” We observed no significant difference in DGAT-specific activities between uninfected and infected cells that had not been treated with OA (Fig. 4A). Strikingly, when treated for 6 h with 360 μm OA, Toxoplasma-infected cells, but not uninfected cells, showed a 2.7 ± 0.4-fold increase in DGAT activity. There was no apparent change in DGAT2 protein levels in our membrane fractions after OA stimulation (Fig. 4B), suggesting that DGAT activity is being posttranslationally regulated differently in infected versus uninfected cells. We next sought to determine which host signaling pathways modulate the changes to neutral lipid metabolism triggered by parasite infection. Given the diversity of possible signaling networks manipulated by Toxoplasma to up-regulate LDs, we adopted a pharmacological strategy to identify potential players. We chose the inhibitor of mTOR signaling Torin-1 as a likely first candidate. mTOR is a central regulator of cellular metabolism; its inhibition reduces global protein translation (24Ma X.M. Blenis J. Molecular mechanisms of mTOR-mediated translational control.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar) and would thus be expected to act against parasite up-regulation of host metabolic proteins. In addition, mTOR inhibition increases autophagic breakdown of LDs, or lipophagy (3Liu K. Czaja M.J. Regulation of lipid stores and metabolism by lipophagy.Cell Death Differ. 2013; 20: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), which could partially counter the accumulation we found associated with Toxoplasma infection. As expected, Torin-1 treatment during infection largely blocked Toxoplasma-induced accumulation of cellular TAG and, thus, the associated built-up LDs (Fig. 5, A and B), indicating that we could indeed pharmacologically inhibit this up-regulation. To identify other host signaling pathways that may be involved, confluent HFFs were infected and treated for 24 h with inhibitors of signaling through HIF1α, c-Myc, EGF receptor (EGFR), or the MAPKs ERK1/2, p38, or JNK. We incubated cells with OA for the last 6 h of infection, stained for neutral lipids with BODIPY 493/503, and imaged. The majority of drugs we tested showed no significant ability to block parasite-induced LD accumulation (Fig. 5 and data not shown), including the HIF1α inhibitor PX-478. We were thus surprised to find that the ALK4/5 inhibitor SB505124, which was shown previously to inhibit Toxoplasma-induced HIF1α activation (25Wiley M. Sweeney K.R. Chan D.A. Brown K.M. McMurtrey C. Howard E.W. Giaccia A.J. Blader I.J. Toxoplasma gondii activates hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) by stabilizing the HIF-1α subunit via type I activin-like receptor kinase receptor signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 26852-26860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), was able to partially inhibit LD accumulation in infected cells. More recently, SB505124 was also found to block Toxoplasma replication by inhibiting a parasite kinase (26Brown K.M. Suvorova E. Farrell A. McLain A. Dittmar A. Wiley G.B. Marth G. Gaffney P.M. Gubbels M.J. White M. Blader I.J. Forward genetic screening identifies a small molecule that blocks Toxoplasma gondii growth by inhibiting both host- and parasite-encoded kinases.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10: e1004180Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Given that neither direct inhibition of host HIF1α nor HIF1α knockout (data not shown) had any effect on LD accumulation, we reasoned that parasite growth is required for the observed phenotypes. This suggests that SB505124-mediated killing of parasites was causing the reduction in LD buildup, perhaps by inhibiting the release of an effector required for the observed phenotypes. To our surprise, we noted that one other drug, the widely used JNK inhibitor SP600125, also appeared to block parasite replication (Fig. 5A). We observed, however, that SP600125 treatment much more robustly inhibited LD accumulation than SB505124 (Fig. 5), suggesting that its activity against host JNK may also be relevant. To test this, we used a recently developed JNK inhibitor (JNK-in-8, Ref. 27Zhang T. Inesta-Vaquera F. Niepel M. Zhang J. Ficarro S.B. Machleidt T. Xie T. Marto J.A. Kim N. Sim T. Laughlin J.D. Park H. LoGrasso P.V. Patricelli M. Nomanbhoy T.K. et al.Discovery of potent and selective covalent inhibitors of JNK.Chem. Biol. 2012; 19: 140-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) with greatly improved specificity and an unrelated chemical scaffold to SP600125. Consistent with a requirement for host JNK activity in parasite-induced LD biogenesis, treating infected cells with JNK-in-8 substantially reduced TAG accumulation in infected cells (Fig. 5, A and B) but did not block parasite replication. As JNK-in-8 is an irreversible inhibitor, we were able to eliminate any confounding direct effect it may have on the parasites by pretreating HFFs with drug for 2 h and washing out at the time of infection. Even though such inhibition would only persist until new JNK protein had been synthesized, we found that JNK-in-8 pretreatment blocked ∼30% of the TAG accumulation induced by Toxoplasma infection (Fig. 5B). We therefore conclude that efficient Toxoplasma induction of host LDs appears to require both JNK and mTOR signaling to be uninhibited. Somewhat surprisingly, although both Torin-1 and JNK-in-8 treatment significantly attenuated LD buildup in infected cells, their effects on host metabolic transcript levels were mild. Torin-1 partially blocked Toxoplasma-induced changes to FABP5 transcript levels, whereas JNK-in-8 showed no significant effect. Neither drug significantly reduced the effect of infection on DGAT2 transcript levels (Fig. 5, C and D). That the attenuation of LD accumulation by Torin-1 and JNK-in-8 treatment was far stronger than the inhibition of Toxoplasma-induced transcriptional changes suggests that the observed effect on TAG synthesis of these drugs is largely posttranscriptional. Distinct evolutionary pressure on individual Toxoplasma strains has led to a number of polymorphic effectors that cause strain-specific differences in host cell function (13Hunter C.A. Sibley L.D.

Thus, multiple cellular events that are regulated by an array of signaling molecules and pathways are tightly coordinated to support spermatogenesis. Here, we report findings of a local regulatory axis between the basement membrane (BM), the blood-testis barrier (BTB), and the apical ectoplasmic specialization (apical ES; a testis-specific, actin-rich adherens junction at the Sertoli cell-spermatid interface) to coordinate cellular events across the seminiferous epithelium during the epithelial cycle. In short, a biologically active fragment, noncollagenous 1 (NC1) domain that is derived from collagen chains in the BM, was found to modulate cell junction dynamics at the BTB and apical ES. NC1 domain from the collagen α3(IV) chain was cloned into a mammalian expression vector, pCI-neo, with and without a collagen signal peptide. We also prepared a specific Ab against the purified recombinant NC1 domain peptide. These reagents were used to examine whether overexpression of NC1 domain with high transfection efficacy would perturb spermatogenesis, in particular, spermatid adhesion (i.e., inducing apical ES degeneration) and BTB function (i.e., basal ES and tight junction disruption, making the barrier leaky), in the testis in vivo We report our findings that NC1 domain derived from collagen α3(IV) chain-a major structural component of the BM-was capable of inducing BTB remodeling, making the BTB leaky in studies in vivo Furthermore, NC1 domain peptide was transported across the epithelium via a microtubule-dependent mechanism and is capable of inducing apical ES degeneration, which leads to germ cell exfoliation from the seminiferous epithelium. Of more importance, we show that NC1 domain peptide exerted its regulatory effect by disorganizing actin microfilaments and microtubules in Sertoli cells so that they failed to support cell adhesion and transport of germ cells and organelles (e.g., residual bodies, phagosomes) across the seminiferous epithelium. This local regulatory axis between the BM, BTB, and the apical ES thus coordinates cellular events that take place across the seminiferous epithelium during the epithelial cycle of spermatogenesis.-Chen, H., Mruk, D.

https://openalex.org/W2612674619,"As a consequence of adaptation to the cave environment, the blind Mexican cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus, has evolved several cranial aberrations including changes to bone sizes, shapes and presence of numerous lateral asymmetries. Prior studies of cranial asymmetry in cavefish focused strictly on adult specimens. Thus, the extent to which these asymmetries emerge in adulthood, or earlier in the life history of cavefish, was unknown. We performed a geometric morphometric analysis of shape variation in the chondrocranium and osteocranium across life history in two distinct cavefish populations and surface-dwelling fish. The cartilaginous skull in juveniles was bilaterally symmetric and chondrocranial shape was conserved in all three populations. In contrast, bony skull shapes segregated into significantly distinct groups in adults. Cavefish demonstrated significant asymmetry for the bones surrounding the collapsed eye orbit, and the opercle bone posterior to the eye orbit. Interestingly, we discovered that cavefish also exhibit directional ""bends"" in skull shape, almost always biased to the left. In sum, this work reveals that asymmetric craniofacial aberrations emerge later in the cavefish life history.

Earlier, we reported the direct 3-month results of an online modified mindfulness-based stress reduction training in patients with heart disease, and now we evaluate the effect at 12-month follow-up. 324 patients (mean age 43.2 years, 53.7% male) were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to additional 3-month online mindfulness training or to usual care alone. The primary outcome was exercise capacity measured with the 6 minute walk test (6MWT). Secondary outcomes were blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, NT-proBNP, cortisol levels (scalp hair sample), mental and physical functioning (SF-36), anxiety and depression (HADS), perceived stress (PSS), and social support (PSSS12). Differences between groups on the repeated outcome measures were analyzed with linear mixed models. At 12-months follow-up, participants showed a trend significant improvement exercise capacity (6MWT: 17.9 meters, p = 0.055) compared to UC. Cohen’s D showed significant but small improvement on exercise capacity (d = 0.22; 95%CI 0.05 to 0.39), systolic blood pressure (d = 0.19; 95%CI 0.03 to 0.36), mental functioning (d = 0.22; 95%CI 0.05 to 0.38) and depressive symptomatology (d = 0.18; 95%CI 0.02 to 0.35). All other outcome measures did not change statistically significantly. In the as-treated analysis, systolic blood pressure decreased significantly with 5.5 mmHg (p = 0.045; d = 0.23 (95%CI 0.05–0.41)). Online mindfulness training shows favorable albeit small long-term effects on exercise capacity, systolic blood pressure, mental functioning, and depressive symptomatology in patients with heart disease and might therefore be a beneficial addition to current clinical care.

https://openalex.org/W2612508573,"Cystatin C (CysC) is a versatile and ubiquitously-expressed member of the cysteine protease inhibitor family that is present at notably high concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid. Under mildly denaturing conditions, CysC forms inactive domain-swapped dimers. A destabilizing mutation, L68Q, increases the rate of domain-swapping and causes a fatal amyloid disease, hereditary cystatin C amyloid angiopathy. Wild-type (wt) CysC will also aggregate into amyloid fibrils under some conditions. Propagated domain-swapping has been proposed as the mechanism by which CysC fibrils grow. We present evidence that a CysC mutant, V57N, stabilized against domain-swapping, readily forms fibrils, contradicting the propagated domain-swapping hypothesis. Furthermore, in physiological buffer, wt CysC can form oligomers without undergoing domain-swapping. These non-swapped oligomers are identical in secondary structure to CysC monomers and completely retain protease inhibitory activity. However, unlike monomers or dimers, the oligomers bind fluorescent dyes that indicate they have characteristics of pre-amyloid aggregates. Although these oligomers appear to be a pre-amyloid assembly, they are slower than CysC monomers to form fibrils. Fibrillation of CysC therefore likely initiates from the monomer and does not require domain-swapping. The non-swapped oligomers likely represent a dead-end offshoot of the amyloid pathway and must dissociate to monomers prior to rearranging to amyloid fibrils. These prefibrillar CysC oligomers were potent inhibitors of aggregation of the Alzheimer's-related peptide, β-amyloid. This result illustrates an example where heterotypic interactions between pre-amyloid oligomers prevent the homotypic interactions that would lead to mature amyloid fibrils."
https://openalex.org/W2613408238,"Dioxin and related chemicals alter the expression of a number of genes by activating the aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AHR) to produce a variety of disorders including hepatotoxicity. However, it remains largely unknown how these changes in gene expression are linked to toxicity. To address this issue, we initially examined the effect of 2,3,7,8-tetrachrolodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a most toxic dioxin, on the hepatic and serum metabolome in male pubertal rats and found that TCDD causes many changes in the level of fatty acids, bile acids, amino acids, and their metabolites. Among these findings was the discovery that TCDD increases the content of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), an inducer of inflammation due to the activation of leukocytes, in the liver of rats and mice. Further analyses suggested that an increase in LTB4 comes from a dual mechanism consisting of an induction of arachidonate lipoxygenase-5, a rate-limiting enzyme in LTB4 synthesis, and the down-regulation of LTC4 synthase, an enzyme that converts LTA4 to LTC4. The above changes required AHR activation, because the same was not observed in AHR knock-out rats. In agreement with LTB4 accumulation, TCDD caused the marked infiltration of neutrophils into the liver. However, deleting LTB4 receptors (BLT1) blocked this effect. A TCDD-produced increase in the mRNA expression of inflammatory markers, including tumor-necrosis factor and hepatic damage, was also suppressed in BLT1-null mice. The above observations focusing on metabolomic changes provide novel evidence that TCDD accumulates LTB4 in the liver by an AHR-dependent induction of LTB4 biosynthesis to cause hepatotoxicity through neutrophil activation.

For example, treating laboratory animals with dioxins causes many forms of toxicity such as wasting syndrome, hepatotoxicity, and immunosuppression. These disorders caused by dioxins are of serious concern because of their persistence in humans as well as wildlife owing to their high lipophilicity and resistance to metabolic biotransformation (1.Gasiewicz T.A.

Upon activation by binding to dioxins, AHR migrates to the nucleus and then associates with its cognitive sequence, the xenobiotic responsive element (XRE), present in the 5′-upstream region of the target genes to change their expression (12.Fujisawa-Sehara A. Sogawa K. Yamane M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y.

More than 200 genes are governed by AHR and probably are synergistically associated with toxicity (12.Fujisawa-Sehara A. Sogawa K. Yamane M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y.

Alternative approaches using metabolomics, a comprehensive analysis of cellular components, have been carried out to address the above issue. For instance, dioxins change the levels of a number of cellular components in the liver and serum of mice and rats (13.Lin S. Yang Z. Liu H. Cai Z.

One of these reports provides novel evidence that TCDD reduces the circulating level of azelaic acid by attenuating the expression of carboxylesterase 3 to cause steatohepatitis (15.Matsubara T.

Similarly, our previous metabolomics investigations have suggested that maternal treatment with TCDD disturbs the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the fetal hypothalamus, resulting in the sexual immaturity of the pups as they develop (16.Koga T. Ishida T. Takeda T. Ishii Y. Uchi H. Tsukimori K. Yamamoto M. Himeno M. Furue M. Yamada H. Restoration of dioxin-induced damage to fetal steroidogenesis and gonadotropin formation by maternal co-treatment with α-lipoic acid.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e40322Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In relation to these findings, AHR is suggested to play a role in energy balance through a change in the levels of nutrition-related factors (17.Lindén J. Lensu S. Tuomisto J. Pohjanvirta R. Dioxins, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and the central regulation of energy balance.Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2010; 31: 452-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Considering all these findings, it is expected that subsequent studies based on metabolomic changes will lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of dioxin toxicity. However, such an approach has not yet provided sufficient information. With this in mind, the present study initially examined the effect of TCDD on the hepatic and serum metabolome in male pubertal rats, further expanding the investigation by focusing on an eicosanoid, which has been suggested by metabolomics to be a target candidate for toxicity. More specifically, using metabolomics and an ultra-performance liquid-chromatography (UPLC)-TOF-MS system, we found that TCDD increases the hepatic content of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), an arachidonic acid metabolite produced by the lipoxygenase pathway. LTB4, a representative chemoattractant of neutrophils, activates this type of cell upon binding to its own receptors (BLT1) to evoke an inflammatory response via the release of chemokines and cytokines such as TNF (18.Crooks S.W. Stockley R.A. Leukotriene B4.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 19.Serezani C.H. Lewis C. Jancar S. Peters-Golden M. Leukotriene B4 amplifies NF-κB activation in mouse macrophages by reducing SOCS1 inhibition of MyD88 expression.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). There are several pieces of evidence that the higher status of LTB4, even if its induction is less than 2-fold, is linked directly to tissue damage and a variety of diseases caused by inflammation (20.Kim N.D. Chou R.C. Seung E. Tager A.M. Luster A.D. A unique requirement for the leukotriene B4 receptor BLT1 for neutrophil recruitment in inflammatory arthritis.J. Exp.

In this context, previous reports have suggested that dioxins promote hepatic injury including inflammation and tumors due to activation of not only AHR but also the TNF/IL-1 signaling in hepatocytes (23.Pande K. Moran S.M. Bradfield C.A. Aspects of dioxin toxicity are mediated by interleukin 1-like cytokines.Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24.Kennedy G.D.

Sci. 2014; 140: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Taken together, it would be reasonable to consider that TCDD-produced accumulation of LTB4 activates the signaling of inflammatory cytokines through neutrophil infiltrations, resulting in the aggravation and/or emergence of hepatotoxicity. In the present study, we investigated this hypothesis and the mechanism underlying an increase in LTB4. Male pubertal rats were treated once with TCDD at a dose of 60 μg/kg per os, which is sufficient to induce acute toxicity, and the hepatic extracts were subjected to metabolomic analysis using UPLC-TOF-MS. Highly toxic dioxins suppress food consumption in animals (25.Harris M.W. Moore J.A. Vos J.G. Gupta B.N. General biological effects of TCDD in laboratory animals.Environ. Health Perspect. 1973; 5: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and therefore, to distinguish between the effects of TCDD itself and food restriction, this study involved two control groups: one group was given a diet the amount of which was the same as that consumed by the TCDD-treated group (“pair-fed control”), and another was allowed free access to sufficient food (“control”). The principal component analyses of the metabolomic data obtained from UPLC-TOF-MS in negative- and positive-ion modes (Fig. 1, A and B, respectively) revealed that the clusters of plots in the three groups were distinctly separate from each other. This observation suggests that the profile of the hepatic metabolome varies markedly following TCDD treatment and food restriction. The cluster of TCDD was further away from the control group than from the pair-fed group. Further analysis using an orthogonal-partial-least-squares to latent structures discriminant analysis indicated that TCDD and food restriction significantly increased or reduced the number of mass ions fragmented from hepatic components (Fig. 1, C–F, S-plots). Referring the information for the mass and retention times of these ions to the database suggested that many cellular ingredients were altered, including fatty acids and bile acids. In the pair-fed group, the number of cellular components exhibiting a marked change was less than half that seen in the TCDD-treated group. One fact that seems worthy of special mention is that the present metabolomics showed that TCDD increases the hepatic level of LTB4, a lipid mediator playing a pivotal role in acute inflammation, whereas the degree of this change was modest in the pair-fed group (supplemental Table 1). In sharp contrast, TCDD treatment attenuated the hepatic content of LTC4 derived from LTA4, a common precursor for LTB4 (supplemental Table 1). Part of the change in hepatic components, including leukotrienes, was also observed in the serum (supplemental Fig. 1 and supplemental Table 2). The determination of LTB4 confirmed that TCDD caused about a 1.6-fold increase in this component in the liver (Fig. 1, G and H). It should be noted that there is a discrepancy in the magnification of the LTB4 increase by TCDD between the determination and metabolomics data demonstrating an elevation of more than 20-fold. As seen in Fig. 1G, UPLC-TOF-MS analysis in a selected ion-monitoring mode focusing on the molecular weight of LTB4 (m/z 335.2228) showed the presence of another isomer the retention time of which was a little earlier than LTB4. From its mass and consistent chromatographic behavior with the authentic specimen, this isomer was identified as 17,18-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (17,18-DETA). This isomer appears to be produced by several cytochrome P450s (CYPs) including TCDD-inducible CYP1A1 and -1A2 followed by epoxide-hydrolase-mediated hydrolysis (26.Schwarz D. Kisselev P. Ericksen S.S. Szklarz G.D. Chernogolov A. Honeck H. Schunck W.H. Roots I. Arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acid metabolism by human CYP1A1: highly stereoselective formation of 17(R),18(S)-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid.Biochem.

Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1814: 210-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although 17,18-DETA was increased more than 4-fold by TCDD, metabolomics analysis could not distinguish it from an increase in LTB4. This is one of the reasons for the large gap between the precise determination and metabolomic data described above. The toxicological significance of an increase in 17,18-DETA by TCDD will be discussed below. These results suggest that a marked change in the metabolome occurs in the liver through mechanisms distinct from a reduction in food intake and that accumulation of LTB4 contributes to TCDD-produced acute toxicity. To clarify the mechanism whereby TCDD causes an accumulation of LTB4 in the liver, we examined the hepatic expression of mRNAs coding for LTB4-synthesizing and -metabolizing enzymes. TCDD increased the mRNA level of arachidonate lipoxygenase-5 (ALOX5), which mediates the conversion of arachidonic acid to LTA4, a precursor of LTB4 (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, LTC4 synthase, which catalyzes conversion of LTA4 to another metabolite, LTC4, was reduced following TCDD treatment (Fig. 2A). Although pair-feeding did not influence ALOX5 mRNA, this treatment markedly reduced LTC4 synthase mRNA in the same manner as TCDD treatment (Fig. 2A). The mRNAs coding for cytosolic phospholipase A2, LTA4 hydrolase, and CYP4F1 were all insensitive to both TCDD and pair-feeding treatments (Fig. 2A). A TCDD-produced change in the expression of ALOX5 and LTC4 synthase mRNAs occurred in a dose-dependent manner, and the dose required was comparable with that for the induction of CYP1A1, one of the genes most sensitive toward TCDD (Fig. 2B). The dose of TCDD needed for these changes was markedly lower than that for the increased expression of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), which is also a possible target for hepatic damage caused by TCDD (28.Puga A. Hoffer A. Zhou S. Bohm J.M. Leikauf G.D. Shertzer H.G. Sustained increase in intracellular free calcium and activation of cyclooxygenase-2 expression in mouse hepatoma cells treated with dioxin.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). A dose-dependent change in the expression of ALOX5 and LTC4 synthase was also confirmed in terms of their protein levels (Fig. 2, C and D). In addition, the TCDD-induced expression of ALOX5 mRNA was observed also in the spleen, thymus, and kidney as well as the liver but not in the lung (supplemental Fig. 2). Taken together, these results suggest that TCDD causes an accumulation of LTB4 in the liver via a combined mechanism of ALOX5 induction and LTC4 synthase down-regulation. To discover whether AHR contributes to the alteration in the level of LT-synthesizing enzymes and LTB4 content, we generated rats lacking AHR (AHR-KO rats) by deleting a part of the sequence in the second exon of the AHR gene (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, the rats we produced did not express any AHR. The body weight loss, hepatomegaly, and thymic atrophy caused by exposing WT rats to TCDD disappeared by knocking out the AHR gene (Fig. 3, C and D). In addition, neither an increase in the expression of ALOX5 and CYP1A1 nor a decrease in LTC4 synthase expression was observed in AHR-KO rats (Fig. 3E). In accordance with this finding, the hepatic level of LTB4 in AHR-KO rats remained unchanged even after TCDD treatment (Fig. 3F). An increase in the ALOX5 mRNA and LTB4 content in the liver was also observed in mice (supplemental Fig. 3). The above changes occurred after fewer doses in C57BL/6J mice, a strain that has Ahr with a high affinity for ligands, than in DBA/2J mice that express low-affinity Ahr (supplemental Fig. 3A). These results demonstrate that TCDD facilitates LTB4 synthesis in an AHR-dependent fashion, and also in mice, TCDD causes an accumulation of LTB4 in the liver through the induction of its biosynthesis governed by AHR. To identify the cells which respond to stimulation by TCDD to release LTB4, we analyzed the localization of ALOX5 in the liver. In agreement with the role of LTB4 in neutrophil activation, TCDD dramatically increased the fluorescent foci caused by ly-6g, a neutrophil marker, as well as ALOX5 in the liver (Fig. 4, A and B). However, the ALOX5-positive foci increased by TCDD were localized in a different area from that where the ly-6g signal was observed (Fig. 4A and supplemental Table 3). In addition, neither the expression of CD68, a macrophage marker, nor the percentage of its co-localization with ALOX5 was affected by TCDD treatment (Fig. 4, C and D, and supplemental Table 3). Treating primary hepatocytes prepared from control male pubertal rats with TCDD induced mRNAs coding for ALOX5 as well as CYP1A1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4E). These results suggest that TCDD acts directly on hepatocytes, rather than neutrophils and macrophages, to induce the expression of ALOX5, resulting in the infiltration of neutrophils into the liver due to the increased release of a drawing factor, LTB4. If neutrophil infiltration caused by LTB4 contributes significantly to TCDD-induced hepatotoxicity, blocking the infiltration should reverse or alleviate the disorder. To examine this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment using mice lacking BLT1, which is expressed on the surface of neutrophils (29.Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. A G-protein-coupled receptor for leukotriene B4 that mediates chemotaxis.Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). As expected, although BLT1-KO mice (30.Terawaki K. Yokomizo T. Nagase T. Toda A. Taniguchi M. Hashizume K. Yagi T. Shimizu T. Absence of leukotriene B4 receptor 1 confers resistance to airway hyperresponsiveness and Th2-type immune responses.J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 4217-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) did not express any BLT1 (Fig. 5A), induction of CYP1A1 and ALOX5 by TCDD was observed both in WT and BLT1-KO mice (Fig. 5, A and B). In accordance with neutrophil infiltration into the liver, TCDD concomitantly increased the hepatic level of BLT1 mRNA in T-mice (Fig. 5A). The same was not observed in BLT1-KO mice (Fig. 5A). Even deleting the BLT1 gene failed to restore body-weight loss, hepatomegaly, and thymic atrophy caused by TCDD (supplemental Fig. 4). However, the TCDD-induced neutrophil infiltration in the liver of WT mice was completely abolished by knocking out the BLT1 gene (Fig. 5, B and C). The localization of macrophages in the liver remained unchanged even following BLT1-KO and TCDD treatments (supplemental Fig. 5). In agreement with these observations, although TCDD induced the hepatic expression of the inflammatory markers TNF and PTGS2, these changes were also reduced in BLT1-KO mice (Fig. 5D). In addition, TCDD-produced induction of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum markers of hepatotoxicity, was suppressed by knocking out BLT1 (Fig. 5E). In support of this, co-treatment with zileuton, an ALOX5 inhibitor, of TCDD-exposed rats also restored an induction of both PTGS2 mRNA and ALT activity without affecting the expression of CYP1A1 mRNA (supplemental Fig. 6). These results demonstrate that neutrophil infiltration due to an increase in LTB4 is one of the causal factors for TCDD-produced hepatotoxicity. Although the synthesis and degradation of eicosanoids, which are governed by AHR and other nuclear receptors, probably provoke a number of beneficial and malignant responses, it is still largely unknown how the downstream mechanisms and their interplay are linked to the outcome (31.Nebert D.W. Karp C.L. Endogenous functions of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR): intersection of cytochrome P450 1 (CYP1)-metabolized eicosanoids and AHR biology.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 36061-36065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The present study provides novel evidence that TCDD increases the hepatic content of LTB4 through the simultaneous mechanisms of ALOX5 induction and LTC4 synthase down-regulation in an AHR-dependent manner (Fig. 6). In agreement with the evidence that LTB4 activates neutrophils to facilitate an inflammatory response, including the release of cytokines (18.Crooks S.W. Stockley R.A. Leukotriene B4.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), TCDD causes infiltration of neutrophils into the liver and induces the hepatic expression of TNF and PTGS2; the deletion of the BLT1 gene blocked these effects. In addition, an increase by TCDD in ALT and AST was suppressed by knocking out BLT1. These pieces of evidence support our latest insight into the mechanism whereby TCDD elicits hepatotoxicity through an increase in LTB4 followed by increased infiltration of neutrophils (Fig. 6). As confirmed in the present study, TCDD is reported to induce the hepatic expression of PTGS2 (28.Puga A. Hoffer A. Zhou S. Bohm J.M. Leikauf G.D. Shertzer H.G. Sustained increase in intracellular free calcium and activation of cyclooxygenase-2 expression in mouse hepatoma cells treated with dioxin.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition to this change, phospholipase A2 is activated as a consequence of TCDD-promoted increase in intracellular Ca2+ (28.Puga A. Hoffer A. Zhou S. Bohm J.M. Leikauf G.D. Shertzer H.G. Sustained increase in intracellular free calcium and activation of cyclooxygenase-2 expression in mouse hepatoma cells treated with dioxin.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). Therefore, it should be noted that prostaglandins and/or thromboxanes produced via the phospholipase A2-PTGS2 pathway may play a substantial role in the cellular toxicity of TCDD (32.Wu K.K. Control of cyclooxygenase-2 transcriptional activation by pro-inflammatory mediators.Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2005; 72: 89-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We confirmed that the TCDD dose needed to induce PTGS2 mRNA is more than 20 μg/kg. However, a significant change in the expression of ALOX5 and LTC4 synthase mRNAs was caused by TCDD starting at a dose of 5 μg/kg. Thus, the accumulation of LTB4 appears to occur after distinctly lower doses of TCDD compared with PTGS2 induction. Furthermore, knocking out the BLT1 gene drastically suppressed the hepatic induction of PTGS2 produced by TCDD. Based on these observations, it seems likely that TCDD initially draws neutrophils into the hepatocytes by facilitating the ALOX5/LTB4 pathway, and the increased inflammation in the tissues then act"

In this study, we investigated the craniofacial abnormalities in a mouse model for Keutel syndrome, a rare genetic disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the matrix Gla protein (MGP) gene. Keutel syndrome patients show diffuse ectopic calcification of cartilaginous tissues and impaired midface development. Our comparative cephalometric analyses of micro-computed tomography images revealed a severe midface hypoplasia in Mgp−/− mice. In vivo reporter studies demonstrated that the Mgp promoter is highly active at the cranial sutures, cranial base synchondroses, and nasal septum. Interestingly, the cranial sutures of the mutant mice showed normal anatomical features. Although we observed a mild increase in mineralization of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis, it did not reduce the relative length of the cranial base in comparison with total skull length. Contrary to this, we found the nasal septum to be abnormally mineralized and shortened in Mgp−/− mice. Transgenic restoration of Mgp expression in chondrocytes fully corrected the craniofacial anomalies caused by MGP deficiency, suggesting a local role for MGP in the developing nasal septum. Although there was no up-regulation of markers for hypertrophic chondrocytes, a TUNEL assay showed a marked increase in apoptotic chondrocytes in the calcified nasal septum. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed unusual mineral deposits in the septal extracellular matrix of the mutant mice. Of note, the systemic reduction of the inorganic phosphate level was sufficient to prevent abnormal mineralization of the nasal septum in Mgp−/−;Hyp compound mutants. Our work provides evidence that modulation of local and systemic factors regulating extracellular matrix mineralization can be possible therapeutic strategies to prevent ectopic cartilage calcification and some forms of congenital craniofacial anomalies in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2612871184,"Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) is a rare variant of HCC that most frequently affects young adults. Because of its rarity and an absence of preclinical models, our understanding of FL-HCC is limited. Our objective was to analyze chromosomal alterations and dysregulated gene expression in tumor specimens collected at a single center during two decades of experience with FL-HCC. We analyzed 38 specimens from 26 patients by array comparative genomic hybridiziation (aCGH) and 35 specimens from 15 patients by transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq). All tumor specimens exhibited genomic instability, with a higher frequency of genomic amplifications or deletions in metastatic tumors. The regions encoding 71 microRNAs (miRs) were deleted in at least 25% of tumor specimens. Five of these recurrently deleted miRs targeted the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) gene product, and a correlating 100-fold upregulation of IGF2BP1 mRNA was seen in tumor specimens. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated intrapatient tumor similarity, independent of recurrence site or time. The p53 tumor suppressor pathway was downregulated as demonstrated by both aCGH and RNA-seq analysis. Notch, EGFR, NRAS, and RB1 pathways were also significantly dysregulated in tumors compared with normal liver tissue. The findings illuminate the genomic and transcriptomic landscape of this rare disease and provide insight into dysregulated oncogenic pathways and potential therapeutic targets in FL-HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2613815235,"Small heat-shock proteins (sHSPs) are a conserved group of molecular chaperones with important roles in cellular proteostasis. Although sHSPs are characterized by their small monomeric weight, they typically assemble into large polydisperse oligomers that vary in both size and shape but are principally composed of dimeric building blocks. These assemblies can include different sHSP orthologues, creating additional complexity that may affect chaperone activity. However, the structural and functional properties of such hetero-oligomers are poorly understood. We became interested in hetero-oligomer formation between human heat-shock protein family B (small) member 1 (HSPB1) and HSPB6, which are both highly expressed in skeletal muscle. When mixed in vitro, these two sHSPs form a polydisperse oligomer array composed solely of heterodimers, suggesting preferential association that is determined at the monomer level. Previously, we have shown that the sHSP N-terminal domains (NTDs), which have a high degree of intrinsic disorder, are essential for the biased formation. Here we employed iterative deletion mapping to elucidate how the NTD of HSPB6 influences its preferential association with HSPB1 and show that this region has multiple roles in this process. First, the highly conserved motif RLFDQXFG is necessary for subunit exchange among oligomers. Second, a site ∼20 residues downstream of this motif determines the size of the resultant hetero-oligomers. Third, a region unique to HSPB6 dictates the preferential formation of heterodimers. In conclusion, the disordered NTD of HSPB6 helps regulate the size and stability of hetero-oligomeric complexes, indicating that terminal sHSP regions define the assembly properties of these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2613920688,"Generalist species commonly have a fundamental role in ecosystems as they can integrate spatially distinct habitats and food-web compartments, as well as control the composition, abundance and behavior of organisms at different trophic levels. Generalist populations typically consist of specialized individuals, but the potential for and hence degree of individual niche variation can be largely determined by habitat complexity. We compared individual niche variation within three generalist fishes between two comparable lakes in the Czech Republic differing in macrophyte cover, i.e. macrophyte-rich Milada and macrophyte-poor Most. We tested the hypothesis that large individual niche variation among generalist fishes is facilitated by the presence of macrophytes, which provides niches and predation shelter for fish and their prey items. Based on results from stable nitrogen (δ15N) and carbon (δ13C) isotopic mixing models, perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) and rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus (L.)) showed larger individual variation (i.e., variance) in trophic position in Milada as compared to Most, whereas no significant between-lake differences were observed for roach (Rutilus rutilus (L.)). Contrary to our hypothesis, all the three species showed significantly lower individual variation in the relative reliance on littoral food resources in Milada than in Most. Rudd relied significantly more whereas perch and roach relied less on littoral food resources in Milada than in Most, likely due to prevalent herbivory by rudd and prevalent zooplanktivory by perch and roach in the macrophyte-rich Milada as compared to macrophyte-poor Most. Our study demonstrates how the succession of macrophyte vegetation, via its effects on the physical and biological complexity of the littoral zone and on the availability of small prey fish and zooplankton, can strongly influence individual niche variation among generalist fishes with different ontogenetic trajectories, and hence the overall food-web structures in lake ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2612495784,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are able to self-renew and to differentiate into all blood cells. HSCs reside in a low-perfusion niche and depend on local signals to survive and to maintain the capacity for self-renewal. HSCs removed from the niche are unable to survive without addition of hematopoietic cytokines and rapidly lose their ability to self-renew. We reported previously that inhibition of both GSK-3 and mTORC1 is essential to maintain long-term HSCs ex vivo. Although Wnt/β-catenin signaling downstream of GSK-3 is required for this response, the downstream effectors of mTORC1 remain undefined. We now report that HSCs express a pro-autophagic gene signature and accumulate LC3 puncta only when both mTORC1 and GSK-3 are inhibited, identifying autophagy as a signature for a signaling network that maintains HSCs ex vivo. In addition, these conditions sustain HSC repopulating function despite an increased rate of global translation. Together, these findings provide new insight into the relative contributions of various mTORC1 outputs toward the maintenance of HSC function and build upon the growing body of literature implicating autophagy and tightly controlled protein synthesis as important modulators of diverse stem cell populations."
https://openalex.org/W2613610208,"Here, we compared miRNA expression profiles in embryonic cell cultures of the conifer Picea balfouriana following application of the synthetic cytokinin 6-benzylaminopurine (6-BAP). We used next-generation sequencing to analyze three libraries of small RNAs from the treated embryogenic cell cultures and generated 24,000,000 raw reads from each of the libraries. Over 70 differentially regulated micro RNA (miRNA) families (≥2 fold change in expression) were identified between pairs of treatments. A quantitative analysis showed that miR3633 and miR1026 were upregulated in tissues with the highest embryogenic ability. These two miRNAs were predicted to target genes encoding receptor-like protein kinase and GAMYB transcription factors, respectively. In one library, miR1160, miR5638, miR1315, and miR5225 were downregulated. These four miRNAs were predicted to target genes encoding APETALA2, calmodulin-binding protein, and calcium-dependent protein kinase transcription factors. The expression patterns of the miRNAs and their targets were negatively correlated. Approximately 181 potentially novel P. balfouriana miRNAs were predicted from the three libraries, and seven were validated during the quantitative analysis. This study is the first report of differential miRNA regulation in tissues treated with 6-BAP during somatic embryogenesis. The differentially expressed miRNAs will be of value for investigating the mechanisms of embryogenic processes that are responsive to 6-BAP in P. balfouriana."

The association between the risk of incident SS and a history of mycobacterial infection, including TB and NTM, was quantified by calculating odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using conditional logistic regression analysis after adjustment for Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and bronchiectasis.The mean age was 55±14 years, and the proportion of female gender was 87.8% in both newly diagnosed SS cases andnon-SS controls. An association was observed between NTM infection (OR, 11.24; 95% CI, 2.37-53.24) and incident SS, but not between TB infection and incident SS (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.97-1.71) after adjustment for CCI and bronchiectasis. The association between NTM and SS risk was remarkably strong among those aged between 45 and 65 years (OR, 39.24; 95% CI, 3.97-387.75) and those without bronchiectasis (OR, 39.98; 95% CI, 3.83-376.92).The study reveals a significant association of newly diagnosed SS with a history NTM infection, especially among individuals aged 40-65 years or those without bronchiectasis."

In this study, we investigate optical enhancement and absorption of gold nanobars with different thicknesses for transverse and longitudinal polarizations using finite element method simulations. This study also reports on the discrepancy in the resonance wavelengths and optical enhancement of the sharp-corner and round-corner nanobars of constant length 100 nm and width 60 nm. The result shows that resonance amplitude and wavelength have strong dependences on the thickness of the nanostructure as well as the sharpness of the corners, which is significant since actual fabricated structure often have rounded corners. Primary resonance mode blue-shifts and broadens as the thickess increases due to decoupling of charge dipoles at the surface for both polarizations. The broadening effect is characterized by measuring the full width at half maximum of the spectra. We also present the surface charge distribution showing dipole mode oscillations at resonance frequency and multimode resonance indicating different oscillation directions of the surface charge based on the polarization direction of the field. Results of this work give insight for precisely tuning nanobar structures for sensing and other enhanced optical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2613847425,"Bile acids and epithelial-derived human β-defensins (HβDs) are known to be important factors in the regulation of colonic mucosal barrier function and inflammation. We hypothesized that bile acids regulate colonic HβD expression and aimed to test this by investigating the effects of deoxycholic acid (DCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid on the expression and release of HβD1 and HβD2 from colonic epithelial cells and mucosal tissues. DCA (10–150 μM) stimulated the release of both HβD1 and HβD2 from epithelial cell monolayers and human colonic mucosal tissue in vitro. In contrast, ursodeoxycholic acid (50–200 μM) inhibited both basal and DCA-induced defensin release. Effects of DCA were mimicked by the Takeda GPCR 5 agonist, INT-777 (50 μM), but not by the farnesoid X receptor agonist, GW4064 (10 μM). INT-777 also stimulated colonic HβD1 and HβD2 release from wild-type, but not Takeda GPCR 5−/−, mice. DCA stimulated phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB, an effect that was attenuated by ursodeoxycholic acid, whereas an NF-κB inhibitor, BMS-345541 (25 μM), inhibited DCA-induced HβD2, but not HβD1, release.

https://openalex.org/W2613039057,"SERCA1, the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase of skeletal muscle, is essential for muscle relaxation and maintenance of low resting Ca2+ levels in the myoplasm. We recently reported that small ankyrin 1 (sAnk1) interacts with the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase in skeletal muscle (SERCA1) to inhibit its activity. We also showed that this interaction is mediated at least in part through sAnk1's transmembrane domain in a manner similar to that of sarcolipin (SLN). Earlier studies have shown that SLN and phospholamban, the other well studied small SERCA-regulatory proteins, oligomerize either alone or together. As sAnk1 is coexpressed with SLN in muscle, we sought to determine whether these two proteins interact with one another when coexpressed exogenously in COS7 cells. Coimmunoprecipitation (coIP) and anisotropy-based FRET (AFRET) assays confirmed this interaction. Our results indicated that sAnk1 and SLN can associate in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane and after exogenous expression in COS7 cells in vitro but that their association did not require endogenous SERCA2. Significantly, SLN promoted the interaction between sAnk1 and SERCA1 when the three proteins were coexpressed, and both coIP and AFRET experiments suggested the formation of a complex consisting of all three proteins. Ca2+-ATPase assays showed that sAnk1 ablated SLN's inhibition of SERCA1 activity.

These interactions are hypothesized to maintain a link between the SR membrane and the underlying proteins of the contractile apparatus. Later studies revealed that elimination of sAnk1 by homologous recombination reduced SR function (21Giacomello E. Quarta M. Paolini C. Squecco R. Fusco P. Toniolo L. Blaauw B. Formoso L. Rossi D.

Cell Sci. 2011; 124: 3619-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Reducing sAnk1 expression with siRNA also led to decreased levels of SERCA1 and SLN proteins and inhibition of Ca2+ clearance from the myoplasm (17Ackermann M.A. Ziman A.P. Strong J. Zhang Y. Hartford A.K. Ward C.W. Randall W.R. Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Bloch R.J. Integrity of the network sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle requires small ankyrin 1.J. Cell Sci. 2011; 124: 3619-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These results were among the first to suggest sAnk1 could interact with SERCA1 and SLN. We recently reported that sAnk1 interacts directly with SERCA1 in a manner similar to, but distinct from, SLN. Similarities between sAnk1 and SLN include their TM a.a. sequences and their shared ability to homodimerize (1Desmond P.F. Muriel J. Markwardt M.L. Rizzo M.A. Bloch R.J.

Also, like SLN, sAnk1 binding to SERCA1 leads to a reduction in SERCA1's apparent Ca2+ affinity, mediated by the sAnk1 TM domain. Intriguingly, the studies of sAnk1 knockdown by Ackermann et al. (17Ackermann M.A. Ziman A.P. Strong J. Zhang Y. Hartford A.K. Ward C.W. Randall W.R. Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Bloch R.J.

Cell Sci. 2011; 124: 3619-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) showed that the residual sAnk1 showed reduced colocalization with SERCA1, whereas its colocalization with SLN was unaffected. Based on this observation, and the ability of SLN and PLN to form homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers, we asked whether sAnk1 could interact with SLN alone or in a three-way complex with SERCA1. As both sAnk1 and SLN are coexpressed together in skeletal muscle, we hypothesized that the two proteins together may affect SERCA1 activity differently than either protein alone (13Zhou D.

Here, we investigate whether sAnk1 and SLN interact, and how their coexpression with SERCA1 alters these interactions and the ability to regulate SERCA1 activity. coIP was used to study the ability of sAnk1 to interact with SLN in SR vesicles prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle tissue. When antibodies against sAnk1 were used to generate the immunoprecipitate, immunoblot analysis revealed coIP of SLN (Fig. 1A). This suggests that sAnk1 and SLN are present in a complex within the SR membrane. We next assessed the ability of sAnk1 and SLN to interact in an exogenous expression system. Extracts from COS7 cells transfected to express the sAnk1-mCherry and FLAG-SLN fusion proteins gave similar results. Immunoblots of the IP generated using anti-FLAG showed that sAnk1-mCherry was coeluted with SLN (Fig. 1B), consistent with their interaction in SR vesicles. It is important to note that two bands (∼5 and ∼10 kDa) are observed when immunoblotting for FLAG-SLN. This is likely due to SLN's ability to form stable homodimers that persist even following boiling in solutions containing SDS preparatory to SDS-PAGE (26Hellstern S. Pegoraro S. Karim C.B. Lustig A. Thomas D.D. Moroder L. Engel J. Sarcolipin, the shorter homologue of phospholamban, forms oligomeric structures in detergent micelles and in liposomes.J. Biol.

SERCA pump isoforms: their role in calcium transport and disease.Muscle Nerve. 2007; 35: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), including COS7 cells. To learn if sAnk1 and SLN interact directly, and not only in complex with SERCA, we used coIP of the FLAG and mCherry constructs of SLN and sAnk1 to determine whether the endogenous SERCA2b expressed in COS7 cells associated with the sAnk1·SLN complex. As shown in Fig. 1C, SERCA2b fails to coIP with antibodies to either fusion protein. Thus, sAnk1 and SLN associate directly and not via SERCA2b. Notably, the SLN in the coIPs was primarily dimeric in Fig. 1C but approximately equally distributed between monomers and dimers in Fig. 1B and almost exclusively monomeric in Fig. 1A. The factors that alter the stability of SLN dimers are still poorly understood, but such variability has been reported before (23Autry J.M. Rubin J.E. Pietrini S.D. Winters D.L. Robia S.L. Thomas D.D. Oligomeric interactions of sarcolipin and the Ca-ATPase.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 31697-31706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Colocalization of sAnk1-CFP and YFP-SLN in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of transfected COS7 cells was demonstrated using confocal microscopy (Fig. 2A). Analysis with Pearson's correlation coefficient showed a similar level of colocalization between sAnk1 and SLN, as we found with SERCA1 and sAnk1 or SLN in our previous study (Fig. 2A; 0.74 ± 0.057) (1Desmond P.F. Muriel J. Markwardt M.L. Rizzo M.A. Bloch R.J. Identification of small ankyrin 1 as a novel sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 1 (SERCA1) regulatory protein in skeletal muscle.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 27854-27867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). ER localization was confirmed via cotransfection with the ER marker RFP-KDEL, which yielded similar values for Pearson's correlation coefficient (Fig. 2B). We previously used AFRET assays to demonstrate the association between sAnk1 and SERCA1 (1Desmond P.F. Muriel J. Markwardt M.L. Rizzo M.A. Bloch R.J. Identification of small ankyrin 1 as a novel sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 1 (SERCA1) regulatory protein in skeletal muscle.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 27854-27867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We employed the same methodology here to determine whether Ank1 and SLN reside approximately within 10 nm or less of one another in the ER of COS7 cells. This technique takes advantage of the intrinsically high anisotropy of fluorescent proteins (in contrast to small fluorescent molecules). A donor fluorophore excited with polarized light will have polarized emissions and high anisotropy values. Nearby acceptor molecules may accept photons outside the original plane of polarization via energy transfer, leading to a reduction in the measured anisotropy. This method also reduces the likelihood of false positives caused by overlapping spectra and eliminates the need for other methods of FRET confirmation such as donor dequenching after acceptor photobleaching. For more detail on this method and its advantages, refer to Refs. 27Markwardt M.L. Kremers G.J. Kraft C.A. Ray K. Cranfill P.J. Wilson K.A. Day R.N. Wachter R.M. Davidson M.W.

Fig. 3 shows the results of the AFRET experiments. Cells were illuminated with CFP-selective wavelengths, and the fluorescence polarization was measured in both the donor (CFP) and FRET (YFP) channels to look exclusively at heterotransfer FRET between the two fluorescent proteins. YFP anisotropies under direct excitation were also monitored for potential YFP-YFP homotransfer, and anisotropies less than or equal to FRET anisotropies were excluded to minimize the influence of potential homotransfer on the anisotropy measurement in the FRET channel (see under “Experimental procedures”). We found that energy transfer occurred in cells coexpressing sAnk1-CFP and YFP-SLN (Δrmean = 0.03 ± 0.006). This value was statistically significant when tested against a theoretical mean of zero (p = 0.0001). The AFRET value measured for sAnk1-CFP and YFP-SLN was in a range similar to that observed between CFP-SERCA1 and YFP-SLN (Δrmean = 0.068 ± 0.007) and CFP-SERCA1 and sAnk1-YFP (Δrmean = 0.021 ± 0.005). In contrast, dysferlin, a protein of the transverse tubules in skeletal muscle but that accumulates in the ER of COS7 cells, failed to show energy transfer with sAnk1 when it served as the acceptor fluorophore, as reported (1Desmond P.F. Muriel J. Markwardt M.L. Rizzo M.A. Bloch R.J. Identification of small ankyrin 1 as a novel sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 1 (SERCA1) regulatory protein in skeletal muscle.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 27854-27867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Calculated anisotropy values are shown in supplemental Fig. 1. The observed FRET between sAnk1 and SLN indicates that these two proteins reside within molecular distances of one another in the ER of COS7 cells, consistent with their direct interaction. The results presented above raised the question of how sAnk1 and SLN may alter the other's ability to interact with SERCA1. To address this, we first performed coIP experiments with antibodies to SERCA1 in extracts of COS7 cells transfected to express SERCA1 and sAnk1-FLAG or FLAG-SLN, or all three proteins. Intriguingly, the addition of FLAG-SLN led to a dramatic increase in the coIP of sAnk1 with SERCA1 compared with cotransfection of SERCA1 and sAnk1 (Fig. 4A). This increase was statistically significant (2.6-fold; p = 0.0047; Figure 3, Figure 4B). Increasing the expression of FLAG-SLN further by introducing greater amounts of FLAG-SLN plasmid during the transfection step promoted increased coIP of sAnk1-FLAG with SERCA1 (Fig. 4, C and E). The increase in sAnk1 present in the coIP varied linearly with the amount of FLAG-SLN cDNA used for transfection and was statistically significant, as determined via linear regression analysis (slope m = 0.67; p = 0.0018). Notably, as seen with coIP of sAnk1 and SLN from extracts of COS7 cells (Fig. 1), SERCA1 also associates preferentially with SLN that appears dimeric after SDS-PAGE, irrespective of the relative amount of associated sAnk1 and despite the fact that most of the SLN in the input lanes appears monomeric. We next performed the reciprocal experiment, in which we used increasing amounts of sAnk1-FLAG plasmid, while keeping plasmids encoding SERCA1 and FLAG-SLN constant. Unexpectedly, we saw no effect on increasing the amounts of plasmid encoding sAnk1-FLAG on coIP of FLAG-SLN with SERCA1 (Fig. 4D). This was confirmed by linear regression analysis, for which the slope was not significantly different from zero (m = 0.04, both bands; p = 0.46, upper band and 0.45, lower band; Fig. 4F). We previously showed that sAnk1 interacts with SERCA1 through both TM and cytoplasmic interactions by using a TM mutant of sAnk1 in which all the residues were changed to leucines and by using a bacterially expressed protein containing the cytoplasmic portion of sAnk1 (sAnk1(29–155)). Here we used the same cytoplasmic region of sAnk1 to determine whether SLN had any effect on the cytoplasmic interaction between sAnk1 and SERCA1. Similarly to its effect on the interaction between SERCA1 and full-length sAnk1, the presence of FLAG-SLN enhanced the interaction between sAnk1(29–155) and SERCA1 by 2.7-fold (Fig. 5). We also used AFRET to determine whether FLAG-SLN enhanced the interaction between sAnk1 and SERCA1. Compared with the AFRET signal from COS7 cells transfected with cDNAs encoding CFP-SERCA1 and sAnk1-YFP, the signal from cells cotransfected to express these two proteins and FLAG-SLN had an increased Δrmean (0.021 ± 0.005 versus 0.036 ± 0.003; p = 0.04; Fig. 3). Thus, all our results indicate that SLN promotes the interaction between sAnk1 and SERCA1. To examine the possibility of a trimeric complex of SLN, sAnk1, and SERCA1, we used a bimolecular fluorescence complementation strategy (30Kerppola T.K. Biomolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis as a probe of protein interactions in living cells.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 37: 465-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). N- and C-terminal portions of mVen were fused to SLN and sAnk1, respectively, and expressed in COS7 cells. The two split mVen constructs associated to generate a complex that was fluorescent, consistent with the formation of a complete Venus molecule (Fig. 6, 4th row). This was specific, as a small portion of dysferlin, FLAG-tagged and linked to mVen-N, did not generate Venus fluorescence when cotransfected with sAnk1-mVen-C (Fig. 6, 3rd row). Untransfected cells and cells transfected with only one plasmid were used as controls and also showed no Venus fluorescence (Fig. 6, 2nd and 3rd rows and data not shown) This confirms the specific association of sAnk1 with SLN in COS7 cells. Unexpectedly, fluorescence from SLN-mVen-N·sAnk1-mVen-C complexes was highly depolarized (Fig. 7A), indicating a high degree of FRET between SLN·sAnk1 complexes from multimerization. Fluorescence anisotropies of untagged mVenus fragments were consistent with other monomeric fluorescent proteins (31Rizzo M.A. Springer G. Segawa K. Zipfel W.R. Piston D.W.

A, COS7 cells were cotransfected with either SLN-mVen-N and sAnk1-mVen-C or control plasmids containing only the two half-fragments of mVenus (mVen-N and mVen-C). Transfections were performed using a [C]final of 1 μg/ml. Cells were imaged using fluorescence polarization microscopy, and anisotropy values were tabulated at the pixel level. Histograms were normalized to the total number of pixels (mVen-N + mVen-C, 13,322 pixels, ∼40 cells; SLN-mVen-N + sAnk1-mVen-C, 22,790 pixels, ∼150 cells; p < 0.0001 by t test; curves shown are fits to a single component Gaussian (r2 = 0.9990 for each curve)). B, cotransfection with CFP-SERCA1 changed the distribution of anisotropy values observed for SLN-mVen-N·sAnk1-mVen-C FRET (SLN-mVen-N + sAnk1-mVen-C, 36,623 pixels, ∼270 cells; SLN-mVen-N + sAnk1-mVen-C + CFP-SERCA1, 11,898 pixels, ∼100 cells, p < 0.0001 by t test; curves shown are fits to a single Gaussian component (r2 = 0.9997 and 0.9993 for −/+ CFP-SERCA1, respectively)).

Scale bars, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we tested whether coexpression of CFP-SERCA1 affected the interaction of the SLN·sAnk1 multimeric complex (Fig. 7B). Expression of CFP-SERCA1 shifted the distribution of anisotropy values observed for SLN-mVen-N·sAnk1-mVen-C complexes collected under YFP illumination to examine homotransfer FRET. Notably, the anisotropy values under this condition are depolarized compared with mVen-N and mVen-C complexes alone, indicating the presence of FRET, albeit significantly reduced compared with conditions lacking CFP-SERCA1. This result indicates that the SLN-mVen-N·sAnk1-mVen-C complexes remain intact, but their relative molecular orientation becomes shifted after association with CFP-SERCA1. This is consistent with the formation of a three-way complex containing sAnk1, SLN, and SERCA1. Notably, the anisotropy did not increase to monomeric levels observed in the untagged mVen-N, mVen-C control, suggesting that the complexes are still intact and within molecular distances.

As a single, low-cost laboratory test to diagnose ID before anemia develops is lacking, the study objective was to improve ID screening by identifying risk factors among non-anemic, iron-deficient reproductive age women.Cross-sectional data were from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2010. Hemoglobin identified non-anemic women. ID was defined using the body iron formula, requiring ferritin and transferrin receptor values. Logistic regression assessed the association of sociodemographic, behavioral, and reproductive risk factors in an anemia-based conceptual framework with non-anemic reproductive age women (12-49 years) with ID, as well as subsets of younger (12-21 years) and older (22-49 years) women, recognizing that risks may differ by age.Among 6216 women, 494 had ID (prevalence was 8.0%, 95% CI 7.3%, 8.6%). Among non-anemic younger women, 250 (8.7%, 95% CI 7.7%, 9.8%) had ID, compared to 244 (7.3%, 95% CI 6.4%, 8.2%) older women. Among younger women, menstruation for over 3 years was the only variable significantly associated with non-anemic ID (risk ratio 3.18, 95% CI 2.03, 4.96). No other significant risk factors were identified.Menstrual years was the only risk factor significantly associated with ID among non-anemic younger women. The negative results suggest ID risk factors among non-anemic women may need to be considered separately from those associated with ID anemia."

https://openalex.org/W2612866636,"The acidic (leucine-rich) nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family member B (ANP32B), a highly conserved member of the acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 (ANP32) family, is critical for the development of normal tissue. However, its role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial. In this study, we elucidated the role of ANP32B in HCC cell lines and tissues. ANP32B expression in HCC cell lines was modulated using siRNA and ANP32B expression plasmids and lentiviruses. The levels of apoptosis-related proteins were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. The expression of ANP32B in tissues from patients with HCC was investigated using real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. ANP32B knockdown by siRNA altered the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in HCC cell lines and reduced the expression of cleaved forms of caspase 3 and caspase 9, but not that of caspase 8, in HCC cells cultured with the pro-apoptotic agent staurosporine. Phosphorylated Bad was upregulated, whereas Bak was downregulated. Moreover, ABT-737, which binds to and inhibits anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family, rendered HCC cells resistant to apoptosis induced by ANP32B silencing. Conversely, ANP32B overexpression decreased Bad phosphorylation and upregulated Bak, but did not induce apoptosis because Bax expression was downregulated. In tissues from patients with HCC, a low tumor/non-tumor ratio of ANP32B mRNA expression was related to advanced UICC stage (p = 0.032). TUNEL-positive cells were observed in parallel with ANP32B expression in HCC tissues. ANP32B modulates Bad phosphorylation as well as Bak and Bax expression, resulting in regulation of apoptosis in HCC. These findings indicate the potential value of ANP32B as a therapeutic target for HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2613100744,"Neighboring plants can decrease or increase each other’s likelihood of damage from herbivores through associational resistance or susceptibility, respectively. Associational effects (AE) can transpire through changes in herbivore or plant traits that affect herbivore movement, densities, and feeding behaviors to ultimately affect plant damage. While much work has focused on understanding the mechanisms that underlie associational effects, we know little about how these mechanisms are influenced by neighborhood composition, i.e., plant density or relative frequency which is necessary to make predictions about when AE should occur in nature. Using a series of field and greenhouse experiments, I examined how plant density and relative frequency affected plant damage to Solanum carolinense and four mechanisms that underlie AE; (i) accumulation of insect herbivores and arthropod predators, (ii) microclimate conditions, (iii) plant resistance, and (iv) specialist herbivore preference. I found a positive relationship between S. carolinense damage and the relative frequency of a non-focal neighbor (Solidago altissima) and all four AE mechanisms were influenced by one or multiple neighborhood components. Frequency-dependence in S. carolinense damage is most likely due to greater generalist herbivore load on S. carolinense (through spillover from S. altissima) with microclimate variables, herbivore preference, predation pressures, and plant resistance having relatively weaker effects. Associational effects may have long-term consequences for these two plant species during plant succession and understanding context-dependent herbivory has insect pest management implication for other plant species in agriculture and forestry."
https://openalex.org/W2613896132,"Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as acetylation and methylation are known to affect chromatin higher order structures. Primary targets of these modifications include basic residues present at N-terminus tail region of core histones. Four histone acetyltransferase (HAT) genes have been identified in trypanosomatids. HAT1, HAT3 and HAT4 of Leishmania donovani have been partially characterized. However, there is no report about HAT2 of Leishmania donovani. Lysine residues present on the N-terminal tail of Leishmania donovani histone H4 are conserved in other trypanosomatids and humans. PTMs of lysines modulate various functions at chromatin level. The four histone acetyltransferases encoded in Leishmania genome were over-expressed to analyse their functional activity. All four HATs were found actively acetylating core histones H3/H4. Similar to L. donovani HAT3 and HAT4, HAT2 was found to be a member of MYST family protein and have SAS2 type domain. Over-expression of HAT2 significantly increases acetylation of H4K4. To analyse the effect of HAT2 over-expression on chromatin accessibility, micrococcal nuclease digestion assay was performed. MNase digestion resulted in a higher proportion of the mononucleosomes and dinucleosomes in HAT2 over-expressing cells as compared to WT L. donovani cells. Acetylation of lysine-4 neutralizes the amino terminal region of histone H4. This weakens its interaction with neighbouring nucleosomes and the linker DNA. HAT2 over-expression in L. donovani resulted in highly accessible chromatin suggesting chromatin decondensation. HAT2 may have an important role to play in global regulation of transcription in L. donovani. Better understanding of these epigenetic determinants of parasite would help in designing novel therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2612475021,"Plant functional traits are increasingly used to generalize across species, however few examples exist of predictions from trait-based models being evaluated in new species or new places. Can we use functional traits to predict growth of unknown species in different areas? We used three independently collected datasets, each containing data on heights of individuals from non-resprouting species over a chronosquence of time-since-fire sites from three ecosystems in south-eastern Australia. We examined the influence of specific leaf area, woody density, seed size and leaf nitrogen content on three aspects of plant growth; maximum relative growth rate, age at maximum growth and asymptotic height. We tested our capacity to perform out-of-sample prediction of growth trajectories between ecosystems using species functional traits. We found strong trait-growth relationships in one of the datasets; whereby species with low SLA achieved the greatest asymptotic heights, species with high leaf-nitrogen content achieved relatively fast growth rates, and species with low seed mass reached their time of maximum growth early. However these same growth-trait relationships did not hold across the two other datasets, making accurate prediction from one dataset to another unachievable. We believe there is evidence to suggest that growth trajectories themselves may be fundamentally different between ecosystems and that trait-height-growth relationships may change over environmental gradients."

Gene losses and gains of 15762 CNA genes were mapped to 795 chromosomal cytoband loci including 280 KEGG pathways. CNAs were classified according to their contribution to Fuhrman tumour gradings G1 and G3. Gene gains and losses turned out to be highly structured processes in ccRCC genomes enabling the subclassification and stratification of ccRCC tumours in a genome-wide manner. CNAs of ccRCC seem to start with common tumour related gene losses flanked by CNAs specifying Fuhrman grade G1 losses and CNA gains favouring grade G3 tumours. The appearance of recurrent CNA signatures implies the presence of causal mechanisms most likely implicated in the pathogenesis and disease-outcome of ccRCC tumours distinguishing lower from higher malignant tumours. The diagnostic quality of initial 201 genes (108 genes supporting G1 and 93 genes G3 phenotypes) has been successfully validated on published Swiss data (GSE19949) leading to a restricted CNA gene set of 171 CNA genes of which 85 genes favour Fuhrman grade G1 and 86 genes Fuhrman grade G3. Regarding these gene sets overall survival decreased with the number of G3 related gene losses plus G3 related gene gains. CNA gene sets presented define an entry to a gene-directed and pathway-related functional understanding of ongoing copy number alterations within and between individual ccRCC tumours leading to CNA genes of prognostic and predictive value.
https://openalex.org/W2613881341,"Interventions incorporating constructs from behavioral economics and psychology have the potential to enhance HIV 'treatment as prevention' (TasP) strategies. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated an intervention to improve antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence based on the concepts of social norms and priming.We used tools from marketing research and patient-centered design to develop a combination intervention that included visual feedback about clinic-level retention in care, a self-relevant prime, and useful take-home items with the priming image. The intervention was implemented at two HIV primary clinics in Shinyanga, Tanzania in 2-week intervals for six months. We conducted a quasi-experimental pilot study with a random sample of exposed and unexposed adult patients living with HIV infection (PLHIV) to compare retention and the proportion of patients with medication possession ratio (MPR) ≥95% after six months. Intervention acceptability was determined with a convenience sample of 405 PLHIV at baseline (n = 189) and endline (n = 216).Medical records were reviewed for 438 PLHIV (320 intervention, 118 standard of care). In adjusted analyses, PLHIV exposed to the intervention were significantly more likely to be in care after 6 months (87% vs. 79%, adjusted odds ratio (ORa) = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.08, 2.78, p<0.05) and were more likely to achieve MPR≥95% (70% vs. 59%, OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 0.96, 2.37, p = 0.07). The intervention was associated with increases in staff support of treatment goals (100% vs. 95%, p = 0.01) and life goals (66% vs. 50%, p<0.01), the perceived likelihood of other patients' adherence (54% vs. 32%, p<0.01), support from other patients (71% vs. 60%, p = 0.03), and being very satisfied with care (53% vs. 35%, p<0.01).This novel intervention has the potential to improve the clinic experience, short-term retention in care, and ART adherence. Future studies are needed to expand the generalizability of the approach and evaluate effectiveness on clinical outcomes.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02938533."
https://openalex.org/W2612870018,"Dynamic changes in the actin network are crucial for the cortical migration of spindles and establishment of polarity, to ensure asymmetric division during meiotic maturation. In this study, filamin A (FLNA) was found to be an essential actin regulator that controlled spindle migration and asymmetric division during oocyte meiosis. FLNA was localized in the cytoplasm and enriched at the cortex and near the chromosomes. Knockdown of FLNA impaired meiotic asymmetric division and spindle migration with a decrease in the amount of cytoplasmic actin mesh and cortical actin levels. Moreover, FLNA knockdown reduced the phosphorylation of cofilin and Rho kinase (ROCK) near the spindle. Similar phenotypes, such as decreased filament actin levels, impaired spindle migration and polar body extrusion, were observed when active cofilin (S3A) was overexpressed or ROCK was inhibited. Notably, we found that FLNA and ROCK interacted directly in mouse oocytes. Taken together, our results show that FLNA plays crucial roles in asymmetric division during meiotic maturation by regulating ROCK-cofilin–mediated actin reorganization.—Wang, H., Guo J., Lin, Z., Namgoong, S., Oh, J.

https://openalex.org/W2612969528,"The main purpose was to validate the use of outdoor-indoor volumetric impaction sampler with Hirst-type spore traps (HTSTs) to continuously monitor fungal load in order to prevent invasive fungal infections during major structural work in hospital settings. For 4 weeks, outdoor fungal loads were quantified continuously by 3 HTSTs. Indoor air was sampled by both HTST and viable impaction sampler. Results were expressed as particles/m3 (HTST) or colony-forming units (CFU)/m3 (biocollector). Paired comparisons by day were made with Wilcoxon's paired signed-rank test or paired Student's t-test as appropriate. Paired airborne spore levels were correlated 2 by 2, after log-transformation with Pearson's cross-correlation. Concordance was calculated with kappa coefficient (κ). Median total fungal loads (TFLs) sampled by the 3 outdoor HTSTs were 3,025.0, 3,287.5 and 3,625.0 particles/m3 (P = 0.6, 0.6 and 0.3).-Concordance between Aspergillaceae fungal loads (AFLs, including Aspergillus spp. + Penicillium spp.) was low (κ = 0.2). A low positive correlation was found between TFLs sampled with outdoor HTST and indoor HTST with applying a 4-hour time lag, r = 0.30, 95% CI (0.23-0.43), P<0.001. In indoor air, Aspergillus spp. were detected by the viable impaction sampler on 63.1% of the samples, whereas AFLs were found by HTST-I on only 3.6% of the samples. Concordance between Aspergillus spp. loads and AFLs sampled with the 2 methods was very low (κ = 0.1). This study showed a 4-hour time lag between increase of outdoor and indoor TFLs, possibly due to insulation and aeraulic flow of the building. Outdoor HTSTs may permit to quickly identify (after 48 hours) time periods with high outdoor fungal loads. An identified drawback is that a too low sample area read did not seem to enable detection of Aspergillaceae spores efficiently. Indoor HTSTs may not be recommended at this time, and outdoor HTSTs need further study. Air sampling by viable impaction sampler remains the reference tool for quantifying fungal contamination of indoor air in hospitals."
https://openalex.org/W2613247415,"Escherichia coli has been the most widely used host to produce large amounts of heterologous proteins. However, given an input plasmid DNA, E. coli may produce soluble protein, produce only inclusion bodies, or yield little or no protein at all. Many efforts have been made to surmount these problems, but most of them have involved time-consuming and labor-intensive trial-and-error. We hypothesized that different metabolomic fingerprints might be associated with different protein production outcomes. If so, then it might be possible to change the expression pattern by manipulating the metabolite environment. As a first step in testing this hypothesis, we probed a subset of the intracellular metabolites by partially labeling it with 13C-glucose. We tested 71 genes and identified 17 metabolites by employing the two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The statistical analysis showed that there existed the metabolite compositions favoring protein production. We hope that this work would help devise a systematic and predictive approach to the recombinant protein production."
https://openalex.org/W2613408776,"The main goal of the therapy with purified human plasma alpha1-antitrypsin (A1AT) is to increase A1AT levels and to prevent lungs from elastolytic activity in patients with PiZZ (Glu342Lys) A1AT deficiency-related emphysema. Potential hepatic gains of this therapy are unknown. Herein, we investigated the effect of A1AT therapy on SERPINA1 (gene encoding A1AT) expression. The expression of SERPINA1 was determined in A1AT or A1AT plus Oncostatin M (OSM) treated primary human hepatocytes isolated from liver tissues from A1AT deficient patients and control liver tissues. In addition, SERPINA1 mRNA was assessed in lung tissues from PiZZ emphysema patients with and without A1AT therapy, and in adherent human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from healthy PiMM donors. In a dose-dependent manner purified A1AT lowered SERPINA1 expression in hepatocytes. This latter effect was more prominent in hepatocytes stimulated with OSM. Although it did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.0539)-analysis of lung tissues showed lower SERPINA1 expression in PiZZ emphysema patients receiving augmentation therapy relative to those without therapy. Finally, exogenously added purified A1AT (1mg/ml) reduced SERPINA1 expression in naïve as well as in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human adherent PBMCs. Exogenous A1AT protein reduces its own endogenous expression. Hence, augmentation with native M-A1AT protein and a parallel reduction in expression of dysfunctional mutant Z-A1AT may be beneficial for PiZZ liver, and this motivates further studies."
https://openalex.org/W4244075550,"Reversible phosphorylation of neuronal proteins plays an important role in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. Myosin phosphatase holoenzyme (MP) consists of a protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) catalytic subunit (PP1c) and a regulatory subunit, termed myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT1). The primary function of MP is to regulate the phosphorylation level of contractile proteins; however, recent studies have shown that MP is localized to neurons, and is also involved in the mediation of neuronal processes. Our goal was to investigate the effect of RhoA-activated kinase (ROK) and MP on the phosphorylation of one potential neuronal substrate, the synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25). SNAP-25 is a member of the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) complex, along with synaptobrevin and syntaxin, and the primary role of SNAP25 is to mediate vesicle fusion. We showed that MYPT1 interacts with SNAP-25, as revealed by immunoprecipitation and surface plasmon resonance based binding studies. Mass spectrometry analysis and in vitro phosphorylation/dephosphorylation assays demonstrated that ROK phosphorylates, while MP dephosphorylates, SNAP-25 at Thr138. Silencing MYPT1 in B50 neuroblastoma cells increased phosphorylation of SNAP-25 at Thr138. Inhibition of PP1 with tautomycetin increased, whereas inhibition of ROK by H1152, decreased the phosphorylation of SNAP-25 at Thr138 in B50 cells, in cortical synaptosomes, and in brain slices. In response to the transduction of the MP inhibitor, kinase-enhanced PP1 inhibitor (KEPI), into synaptosomes, an increase in phosphorylation of SNAP-25 and a decrease in the extent of neurotransmitter release were detected. The interaction between SNAP-25 and syntaxin increased with decreasing phosphorylation of SNAP-25 at Thr138, upon inhibition of ROK. Our data suggest that ROK/MP play a crucial role in vesicle trafficking, fusion, and neurotransmitter release by oppositely regulating the phosphorylation of SNAP-25 at Thr138."
https://openalex.org/W2612536174,"Phototransduction is initiated when the absorption of light converts the 11-cis-retinal chromophore to its all-trans configuration in both rod and cone vertebrate photoreceptors. To sustain vision, 11-cis-retinal is continuously regenerated from its all-trans conformation through a series of enzymatic steps comprising the visual or retinoid cycle. Abnormalities in this cycle can compromise vision because of the diminished supply of 11-cis-retinal and the accumulation of toxic, constitutively active opsin. As shown previously for rod cells, attenuation of constitutively active opsin can be achieved with the unbleachable analogue, 11-cis-6-membered ring (11-cis-6mr)-retinal, which has therapeutic effects against certain degenerative retinal diseases. However, to discern the molecular mechanisms responsible for this action, pigment regeneration with this locked retinal analogue requires delineation also in cone cells. Here, we compared the regenerative properties of rod and green cone opsins with 11-cis-6mr-retinal and demonstrated that this retinal analogue could regenerate rod pigment but not green cone pigment. Based on structural modeling suggesting that Pro-205 in green cone opsin could prevent entry and binding of 11-cis-6mr-retinal, we initially mutated this residue to Ile, the corresponding residue in rhodopsin. However, this substitution did not enable green cone opsin to regenerate with 11-cis-6mr-retinal. Interestingly, deletion of 16 N-terminal amino acids in green cone opsin partially restored the binding of 11-cis-6mr-retinal. These results and our structural modeling indicate that a more complex binding pathway determines the regeneration of mammalian green cone opsin with chromophore analogues such as 11-cis-6mr-retinal."
https://openalex.org/W2612411634,"Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is the principal bioactive ingredient in green tea and has been reported to have many health benefits. EGCG influences multiple signal transduction pathways related to human diseases, including redox, inflammation, cell cycle, and cell adhesion pathways. However, the molecular mechanisms of these varying effects are unclear, limiting further development and utilization of EGCG as a pharmaceutical compound. Here, we examined the effect of EGCG on two representative transmembrane signaling receptors, integrinαIIbβ3 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We report that EGCG inhibits talin-induced integrin αIIbβ3 activation, but it activates αIIbβ3 in the absence of talin both in a purified system and in cells. This apparent paradox was explained by the fact that the activation state of αIIbβ3 is tightly regulated by the topology of β3 transmembrane domain (TMD); increases or decreases in TMD embedding can activate integrins. Talin increases the embedding of integrin β3 TMD, resulting in integrin activation, whereas we observed here that EGCG decreases the embedding, thus opposing talin-induced integrin activation. In the absence of talin, EGCG decreases the TMD embedding, which can also disrupt the integrin α-β TMD interaction, leading to integrin activation. EGCG exhibited similar paradoxical behavior in EGFR signaling. EGCG alters the topology of EGFR TMD and activates the receptor in the absence of EGF, but inhibits EGF-induced EGFR activation. Thus, this widely ingested polyphenol exhibits pleiotropic effects on transmembrane signaling by modifying the topology of TMDs."
https://openalex.org/W2613201662,"This paper proposes a reliable facility location design model under imperfect information with site-dependent disruptions; i.e., each facility is subject to a unique disruption probability that varies across the space. In the imperfect information contexts, customers adopt a realistic “trial-and-error” strategy to visit facilities; i.e., they visit a number of pre-assigned facilities sequentially until they arrive at the first operational facility or give up looking for the service. This proposed model aims to balance initial facility investment and expected long-term operational cost by finding the optimal facility locations. A nonlinear integer programming model is proposed to describe this problem. We apply a linearization technique to reduce the difficulty of solving the proposed model. A number of problem instances are studied to illustrate the performance of the proposed model. The results indicate that our proposed model can reveal a number of interesting insights into the facility location design with site-dependent disruptions, including the benefit of backup facilities and system robustness against variation of the loss-of-service penalty."

Here we report that the small molecule YH250, which specifically antagonizes p300/catenin interaction, stimulates hematopoiesis in lethally or sublethally irradiated mice. A single administration of YH250 24 hours post irradiation can significantly stimulate HSC proliferation, improve survival and accelerate peripheral blood count recovery. Our studies suggest that promotion of the expansion of the remaining HSC population via stimulation of symmetric non-differentiative proliferation is at least part of the mechanism of action."
https://openalex.org/W2613276476,"This study aims to investigate the effect of changes in buoyancy when a swimmer respires in a horizontal posture. We attempted to evaluate the levelness of swimmers' streamline posture by simultaneously measuring the lung capacity and buoyancy under water. The buoyancy was measured based on the changes in the vertical loads of the upper and lower limbs on the subjects' streamline posture under water. The horizontal x-axis as lung ventilation and the vertical y-axis as buoyancy forms a linear equation y = ax + b. The relation between hand (upper-limb) buoyancy and lung ventilation is defined as y = a1x + b1 and that between foot (lower-limb) buoyancy and lung ventilation as y = a2x + b2. Horizontal levelness was calculated as a ratio by dividing a2 by a1 using the inclination (a) values from these formulas for an underwater streamline posture. We defined this ratio as the breathing-balance (BB) ratio. Although the performance levels in the present study did not show any difference in the absolute quantity of air that humans can inhale in a streamline posture, the BB ratio was higher in a statistically significant manner in junior swimmers competing at international levels compared with the other groups of subjects (P < 0.001). This statistical difference in horizontal levelness, despite the absence of a noticeable difference in the absolute quantity of inhaled air, may be attributable to the way in which each person inhales and exhales air. Top-level junior swimmers that exhibited a high BB ratio might have inhaled in a way that would counteract the sinking of the lower limbs, for example, through abdominal respiration. When exhaling, on the other hand, they might have let out air gradually to mitigate the acceleration force involved in submerging the lower limbs."
