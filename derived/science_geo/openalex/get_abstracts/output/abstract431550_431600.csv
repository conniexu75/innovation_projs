Diesel exhaust is relatively cold, compared to gasoline engine exhaust, and conversion of NO to NO 2 has required the use of platinum catalysts. W. Wang et al. (p. 832 ) now report that a more earth-abundant catalyst, based on Mn-mullite (Sm, Gd)Mn 2 O 5 metal oxides was able to oxidize NO in simulated diesel exhaust at temperatures as low as 75°C. Spectroscopic studies and quantum chemical modeling suggested that Mn-nitrates formed on Mn-Mn dimer sites were the key intermediates responsible for NO 2 formation."

https://openalex.org/W1765283661,"All TOGether Now αβ-Tubulin is the polymerizing subunit of microtubules, which are dynamic polymers that have essential roles in cell division and intracellular organization. TOG domains are αβ-tubulin binding modules that occur in the evolutionarily conserved Stu2p/XMAP215 family of proteins and promote microtubule elongation. Ayaz et al. (p. 857 ) used crystallographic and biochemical experiments to reveal that the TOG1 domain interacts with guanosine triphosphate–bound αβ-tubulin in a conformation-selective manner, binding preferentially to a “curved,” microtubule-incompatible conformation. The binding mode apparently excludes analogous binding of a second TOG domain to the same heterodimer and may help to ensure polarized growth of microtubules."
https://openalex.org/W1995776974,"Tropical deforestation and forest fragmentation are among the most important biodiversity conservation issues worldwide, yet local extinctions of millions of animal and plant populations stranded in unprotected forest remnants remain poorly explained. Here, we report unprecedented rates of local extinctions of medium to large-bodied mammals in one of the world's most important tropical biodiversity hotspots. We scrutinized 8,846 person-years of local knowledge to derive patch occupancy data for 18 mammal species within 196 forest patches across a 252,669-km2 study region of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We uncovered a staggering rate of local extinctions in the mammal fauna, with only 767 from a possible 3,528 populations still persisting. On average, forest patches retained 3.9 out of 18 potential species occupancies, and geographic ranges had contracted to 0–14.4% of their former distributions, including five large-bodied species that had been extirpated at a regional scale. Forest fragments were highly accessible to hunters and exposed to edge effects and fires, thereby severely diminishing the predictive power of species-area relationships, with the power model explaining only ∼9% of the variation in species richness per patch. Hence, conventional species-area curves provided over-optimistic estimates of species persistence in that most forest fragments had lost species at a much faster rate than predicted by habitat loss alone."

https://openalex.org/W2116291006,"Background No targeted immunotherapies reverse type 1 diabetes in humans. However, in a rodent model of type 1 diabetes, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) reverses disease by restoring insulin secretion. Specifically, it stimulates innate immunity by inducing the host to produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which, in turn, kills disease-causing autoimmune cells and restores pancreatic beta-cell function through regeneration. Methodology/Principal Findings Translating these findings to humans, we administered BCG, a generic vaccine, in a proof-of-principle, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adults with long-term type 1 diabetes (mean: 15.3 years) at one clinical center in North America. Six subjects were randomly assigned to BCG or placebo and compared to self, healthy paired controls (n = 6) or reference subjects with (n = 57) or without (n = 16) type 1 diabetes, depending upon the outcome measure. We monitored weekly blood samples for 20 weeks for insulin-autoreactive T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and other autoantibodies, and C-peptide, a marker of insulin secretion. BCG-treated patients and one placebo-treated patient who, after enrollment, unexpectedly developed acute Epstein-Barr virus infection, a known TNF inducer, exclusively showed increases in dead insulin-autoreactive T cells and induction of Tregs. C-peptide levels (pmol/L) significantly rose transiently in two BCG-treated subjects (means: 3.49 pmol/L [95% CI 2.95–3.8], 2.57 [95% CI 1.65–3.49]) and the EBV-infected subject (3.16 [95% CI 2.54–3.69]) vs.1.65 [95% CI 1.55–3.2] in reference diabetic subjects. BCG-treated subjects each had more than 50% of their C-peptide values above the 95th percentile of the reference subjects. The EBV-infected subject had 18% of C-peptide values above this level. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that BCG treatment or EBV infection transiently modified the autoimmunity that underlies type 1 diabetes by stimulating the host innate immune response. This suggests that BCG or other stimulators of host innate immunity may have value in the treatment of long-term diabetes. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00607230"
https://openalex.org/W1998577671,"In pancreatic β-cells, uptake of Ca(2+) into mitochondria facilitates metabolism-secretion coupling by activation of various matrix enzymes, thus facilitating ATP generation by oxidative phosphorylation and, in turn, augmenting insulin release. We employed an siRNA-based approach to evaluate the individual contribution of four proteins that were recently described to be engaged in mitochondrial Ca(2+) sequestration in clonal INS-1 832/13 pancreatic β-cells: the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake 1 (MICU1), mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter (MCU), uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), and leucine zipper EF-hand-containing transmembrane protein 1 (LETM1). Using a FRET-based genetically encoded Ca(2+) sensor targeted to mitochondria, we show that a transient knockdown of MICU1 or MCU diminished mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake upon both intracellular Ca(2+) release and Ca(2+) entry via L-type channels. In contrast, knockdown of UCP2 and LETM1 exclusively reduced mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake in response to either intracellular Ca(2+) release or Ca(2+) entry, respectively. Therefore, we further investigated the role of MICU1 and MCU in metabolism-secretion coupling. Diminution of MICU1 or MCU reduced mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake in response to d-glucose, whereas d-glucose-triggered cytosolic Ca(2+) oscillations remained unaffected. Moreover, d-glucose-evoked increases in cytosolic ATP and d-glucose-stimulated insulin secretion were diminished in MICU1- or MCU-silenced cells. Our data highlight the crucial role of MICU1 and MCU in mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake in pancreatic β-cells and their involvement in the positive feedback required for sustained insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2144605182,"Background Social learning research in apes has focused on social learning in the technical (problem solving) domain - an approach that confounds action and physical information. Successful subjects in such studies may have been able to perform target actions not as a result of imitation learning but because they had learnt some technical aspect, for example, copying the movements of an apparatus (i.e., different forms of emulation learning). Methods Here we present data on action copying by non-enculturated and untrained chimpanzees when physical information is removed from demonstrations. To date, only one such study (on gesture copying in a begging context) has been conducted – with negative results. Here we have improved this methodology and have also added non-begging test situations (a possible confound of the earlier study). Both familiar and novel actions were used as targets. Prior to testing, a trained conspecific demonstrator was rewarded for performing target actions in view of observers. All but one of the tested chimpanzees already failed to copy familiar actions. When retested with a novel target action, also the previously successful subject failed to copy – and he did so across several contexts. Conclusion Chimpanzees do not seem to copy novel actions, and only some ever copy familiar ones. Due to our having tested only non-enculturated and untrained chimpanzees, the performance of our test subjects speak more than most other studies of the general (dis-)ability of chimpanzees to copy actions, and especially novel actions."
https://openalex.org/W2065199505,"This study examined the dissociable neural effects of ānāpānasati (focused-attention meditation, FAM) and mettā (loving-kindness meditation, LKM) on BOLD signals during cognitive (continuous performance test, CPT) and affective (emotion-processing task, EPT, in which participants viewed affective pictures) processing. Twenty-two male Chinese expert meditators (11 FAM experts, 11 LKM experts) and 22 male Chinese novice meditators (11 FAM novices, 11 LKM novices) had their brain activity monitored by a 3T MRI scanner while performing the cognitive and affective tasks in both meditation and baseline states. We examined the interaction between state (meditation vs. baseline) and expertise (expert vs. novice) separately during LKM and FAM, using a conjunction approach to reveal common regions sensitive to the expert meditative state. Additionally, exclusive masking techniques revealed distinct interactions between state and group during LKM and FAM. Specifically, we demonstrated that the practice of FAM was associated with expertise-related behavioral improvements and neural activation differences in attention task performance. However, the effect of state LKM meditation did not carry over to attention task performance. On the other hand, both FAM and LKM practice appeared to affect the neural responses to affective pictures. For viewing sad faces, the regions activated for FAM practitioners were consistent with attention-related processing; whereas responses of LKM experts to sad pictures were more in line with differentiating emotional contagion from compassion/emotional regulation processes. Our findings provide the first report of distinct neural activity associated with forms of meditation during sustained attention and emotion processing."

Data on the distribution and on risk factors in Germany are sketchy.Blood samples of a nationwide population-based cross-sectional study from 2003-2006 in children and adolescents aged 1 to 17 years in Germany (KiGGS) were analysed (n = 12,614) to assess the seroprevalence of anti-Borrelia antibodies. Data from standardized interviews were used to assess potential risk factors. First, sera were screened for anti-Borrelia antibodies by ELISA. The overall prevalence was 4.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.3-5.4%). Positive and borderline ELISA test results were confirmed by a line blot revealing a combined prevalence of 4.0% (95% CI 3.6-4.5%). Seroprevalence of ELISA was significantly higher in males (odds ratio (OR) = 1.37; CI 1.15-1.63) and in the southern part of Germany (OR = 1.41; CI 1.09-1.83), but significantly lower in children and adolescents with migration background (OR = 0.33; CI 0.24-0.44). Study participants from households with cats had a higher chance of seropositivity (OR = 6.7; CI 5.6-8.0). In a multivariable model the odds of seropositivity increases by 11% for every year of age for boys and 6% for girls.This survey is the first nationwide, representative seroprevalence survey of LB in children and young adolescents. The study shows that infections with Borrelia burgdorferi are endemic in all parts of Germany despite regional differences. Even at a young age children are exposed to tick bites including seropositivity. Encouraging a thorough check for ticks and promptly removal of ticks are the key public health strategies to reduce the risk of LB and other tick-borne diseases in children and adolescents. Further epidemiological studies are warranted to better understand the burden of disease related to LB."
https://openalex.org/W1969950216,"Fast actin depolymerization is necessary for cells to rapidly reorganize actin filament networks. Utilizing a Listeria fluorescent actin comet tail assay to monitor actin disassembly rates, we observed that although a mixture of actin disassembly factors (cofilin, coronin, and actin-interacting protein 1 is sufficient to disassemble actin comet tails in the presence of physiological G-actin concentrations this mixture was insufficient to disassemble actin comet tails in the presence of physiological F-actin concentrations. Using biochemical complementation, we purified cyclase-associated protein (CAP) from thymus extracts as a factor that protects against the inhibition of excess F-actin. CAP has been shown to participate in actin dynamics but has been thought to act by liberating cofilin from ADP·G-actin monomers to restore cofilin activity. However, we found that CAP augments cofilin-mediated disassembly by accelerating the rate of cofilin-mediated severing. We also demonstrated that CAP acts directly on F-actin and severs actin filaments at acidic, but not neutral, pH. At the neutral pH characteristic of cytosol in most mammalian cells, we demonstrated that neither CAP nor cofilin are capable of severing actin filaments. However, the combination of CAP and cofilin rapidly severed actin at all pH values across the physiological range. Therefore, our results reveal a new function for CAP in accelerating cofilin-mediated actin filament severing and provide a mechanism through which cells can maintain high actin turnover rates without having to alkalinize cytosol, which would affect many biochemical reactions beyond actin depolymerization.

Although coronin and AIP1 are sufficient to relieve the inhibition of cofilin-mediated actin depolymerization in the presence of physiological concentrations of G-actin, the potential problems associated with physiological concentrations of F-actin have not yet been addressed. Listeria monocytogenes utilizes cellular machinery to move through cytoplasm by assembling a branched actin network or “comet tail” behind it (17Tilney L.G. Portnoy D.A.

Thus, Listeria comet tails offer a physiological actin substrate for the in vitro study of cellular mechanisms of actin filament disassembly. Importantly, comet tail assembly can be experimentally separated from disassembly, and we have taken advantage of this in the past to identify several factors necessary for actin comet tail disassembly under the physiological challenge of high actin monomer concentrations. We have now extended the Listeria system to identify additional factors necessary for actin disassembly when the reaction is challenged by high concentrations of actin polymer. All reagents unless otherwise noted were from Sigma-Aldrich. Rhodamine and Alexa Fluor dyes were from Invitrogen. Rabbit skeletal muscle actin, bovine coronin-1A, and AIP1 were purified as described previously (13Brieher W.M. Kueh H.Y. Ballif B.A. Mitchison T.J.

Recombinant human cofilin-1 was purified from 1 liter of Escherichia coli. Cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris at pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm PMSF, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 1 h and then passed through a 10-ml Q HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Cofilin flows through this column. The Q flow-through was dialyzed into 10 mm MES, pH 6.0, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol and applied to a 5-ml S HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in the same buffer. Cofilin was eluted from the column with a 100-ml gradient to 400 mm NaCl in the same buffer. Cofilin eluted from the column at 210 mm NaCl and was typically the only protein remaining at this stage of purification. Cofilin-positive fractions from S were pooled, concentrated using a centrifugal ultrafiltration device and applied to a Superdex 200 16/60 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in Assay Buffer (100 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, pH 7.8). Cofilin eluted at 20 kDa. Filamin was purified from chicken gizzard as described previously (19Brieher W.M. Coughlin M. Mitchison T.J.

Human cyclase-associated protein (CAP) was recombinantly expressed in Rosetta E. coli (EMD) and purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). CAP expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 7 h at room temperature, and CAP was further purified on a Mono Q column (GE Healthcare) at pH 7.8, eluting at ∼220 mm NaCl. Standard buffers consisted of 5 mm Tris, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, pH 8.0 (G Buffer) and Assay Buffer. When used to store proteins, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol or DTT was added. Adjustments to Assay Buffer are noted, and any version of Assay Buffer was converted to Photo Buffer by the addition of 0.2 mm 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-teramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox), 0.4 mg/ml glucose oxidase, and 2.25 mg/ml glucose. Photo Buffers were used within 2 h of initial preparation. Cofilin was labeled with maleimide-activated tetramethylrhodamine by incubation with a 2:1 molar excess of dye for 45 min at room temperature in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride. Labeling was stopped by addition of 2 mm DTT, and unreacted dye was removed by centrifugation for 1 h at 200,000 × g (k factor, 33.8) at 4 °C followed by dialysis against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 Assay Buffer to remove excess dye. Actin was fluorescently labeled as described previously (20Kueh H.Y. Brieher W.M. Mitchison T.J. Dynamic stabilization of actin filaments.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Briefly, actin was labeled on lysine residues by treating F-actin with N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated fluorophores at approximately stoichiometric ratios for 1 h at room temperature before stopping the reaction with 50 mm Tris buffer and extensively dialyzing against G Buffer with 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Human CAP1 cDNA was obtained from Origene and subcloned into the BamHI and SalI sites in the bacterial expression vector pET30a+ (EMD) for expression in Rosetta cells (EMD) with an N-terminal His6 tag. 100 g of frozen bovine calf thymus was thawed by placing it in 200 ml of Buffer A (5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol) at room temperature for 30 min. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. The tissue was cut into small pieces and transferred to 200 ml of fresh Buffer A pre-equilibrated to 4 °C and homogenized in a Waring-type blender. The homogenate was centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000 × g, and insoluble material was discarded. Polyethyleneimine was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 0.05% and stirred for 30 min at 4 °C. The slurry was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellet was discarded. The supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000g (k factor, 133) for 90 min. The supernatant was mixed with 100 ml of DE52 (Whatman), stirred for 60 min, and allowed to settle. The liquid was decanted off the beads, and the beads were resuspended in 100 ml of Buffer A. The slurry was poured into a column, and the flow-through was combined with the decanted solution to generate the DE52 flow-through fraction. The disassembly factors flowed through the column under these conditions. 1 m Pipes, pH 6.8 was added to the DE52 flow-through fraction to a final concentration of 40 mm. The extract was then applied to a 70-ml S HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 0.1 mm DTT (Buffer B). The column was washed with 100 ml of 10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, and this wash was combined with the S flow-through. The pH 6.8 S flow-through fraction was dialyzed overnight against 20 liters of 10 mm MES, pH 6.0, 25 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm DTT (Buffer C) and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g before being applied to a 70-ml S HP column equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was eluted with a 700-ml gradient to 500 mm NaCl in Buffer C. Activity eluted near 180 mm NaCl. Active fractions were dialyzed into Buffer B and applied to a 20 ml hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in Buffer B. The column was eluted with a 300 ml gradient to 300 mm sodium phosphate. Activity eluted near 130 mm sodium phosphate. Active fractions were combined, concentrated in a centrifugal concentrating device, and applied to a 16/60 Superdex S200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in Buffer A with 150 mm NaCl. Active fractions eluted at apparent molecular masses between 500 and 800 kDa. Active fractions from the gel filtration were applied to a 5-ml heparin column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in Buffer A with 150 mm NaCl and eluted with a 100-ml gradient to 500 mm NaCl in Buffer A. Activity eluted near 300 mm NaCl. At this point, only two bands remained on the gel, and both were excised for identification by mass spectrometry. In each experiment, either actin or CAP was held constant, and the other was varied; both were run together using SDS-PAGE (10%). Actin was polymerized in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 Assay Buffer to which an appropriate amount of CAP and/or Assay Buffer was added. Either actin was held constant at 10 μm and CAP was varied, or CAP was held constant at 3 μm, and actin was varied. In either case, actin was allowed to polymerize for 1 h before the addition of CAP after which 20 min was allowed for binding and to re-establish steady state. Of the final 40-μl volume, 20 μl was taken immediately (uncentrifuged), whereas the remaining 20 μl was centrifuged in a Beckman TLA 100 rotor at 350,000 × g (k factor, 8.1) for 20 min at 4 °C, providing a supernatant fraction and after addition of an equal volume of Assay Buffer and resuspension a pellet fraction. Equal volumes of each sample were then separated using SDS-PAGE. Densitometry of Coomassie-stained bands was accomplished using NIH ImageJ software and used to derive a dissociation constant by the method of Wachsstock et al. (21Wachsstock D.H. Schwartz W.H. Pollard T.D. Affinity of α-actinin for actin determines the structure and mechanical properties of actin filament gels.Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Listeria actin comet tails were assembled in the presence of HEK 293 cell extract in homemade perfusion chambers as described previously (13Brieher W.M. Kueh H.Y. Ballif B.A. Mitchison T.J. Rapid actin monomer-insensitive depolymerization of Listeria actin comet tails by cofilin, coronin, and Aip1.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). After rinsing, the chamber was filled with actin disassembly factors under the indicated conditions, and a fluorescence time lapse sequence was acquired to obtain the fluorescence intensity decay and to derive an apparent actin koff as described previously (13Brieher W.M. Kueh H.Y. Ballif B.A. Mitchison T.J. Rapid actin monomer-insensitive depolymerization of Listeria actin comet tails by cofilin, coronin, and Aip1.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Excess F-actin, if supplied in a given experiment, was unlabeled and prepolymerized in Assay Buffer at least 45 min before use. Actin disassembly factors were added to a mixture containing F-actin at the indicated final concentrations, and this mixture was applied to chambers 2 min thereafter. Visualization was achieved with a Zeiss 20× air objective (numerical aperture, 0.8) on a Zeiss Imager M1 stand and recorded with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER charge-coupled device camera driven with Zeiss Axiovision 4.7 software. Utilizing L. monocytogenes actin comet tails as a fluorescent actin substrate, we preincubated the comet tails with either CAP or coronin for 5 min before rinsing twice with 1.5 chamber volumes of Assay Buffer and perfusing in fluorescently labeled cofilin. After rinsing and incubation with zero length cross-linker 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (100 nm; 30 s), chambers were rinsed twice before being perfused with Photo Buffer and visualized as described above except with a Zeiss 40× air objective (numerical aperture, 0.75), taking five images of each chamber (center and one from each quadrant). Images were recorded in both the cofilin and actin channels and corrected separately for background, and finally cofilin intensity was normalized to actin intensity to control for variance between individual chambers, fields, and comet tails. Actin filaments were assembled in perfusion chambers as described previously (21Wachsstock D.H. Schwartz W.H. Pollard T.D. Affinity of α-actinin for actin determines the structure and mechanical properties of actin filament gels.Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Briefly, actin-bundling protein filamin was adsorbed onto the glass surface before blocking the glass with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 Assay Buffer containing 10 mg/ml bovine casein, 0.2% Tween 20, and 0.05% Pluronic F-127. A 4 μm solution of Alexa Fluor 647-G-actin (20% labeled) in either 50 mm Imidazole Assay Buffer at the indicated pH or 50 mm MES Assay Buffer at pH 6 was allowed to polymerize in the chamber before rinsing with Photo Buffer. Actin disassembly factors were then perfused into the chamber in Photo Buffer, and actin filament disassembly was observed using a Zeiss 63× oil objective (numerical aperture, 1.4) and the microscopy equipment and software described above. To image actin polymerization off of new filament ends generated through severing reactions, disassembly was allowed to occur as described for 90 s before rinsing the chambers with buffer and reperfusing with G-actin labeled with a different fluorophore. Photo Buffer was then perfused into the chamber for imaging. Filaments that had been severed during the disassembly step were compared with the dual color image to identify whether new F-actin polymerization happened after a severing event; not all filaments were severed, and not all filaments nucleated growth in the times allotted. To test whether CAP-mediated or CAP/cofilin-mediated severing reactions depend upon phosphate release from F-actin, 20 mm phosphate was added to Assay Buffer from stock phosphate buffers and then adjusted to the final pH value indicated (6 or 7.4). Original movies were acquired and converted to “.tif” stacks using Zeiss Axiovision 4.7 software. In the case of L. monocytogenes actin comet tails, data analysis was accomplished through measuring background-corrected intensity decay over time and either displaying this normalized decay directly or using a single exponential model to plot an apparent actin koff from normalized data as described previously (13Brieher W.M. Kueh H.Y. Ballif B.A. Mitchison T.J. Rapid actin monomer-insensitive depolymerization of Listeria actin comet tails by cofilin, coronin, and Aip1.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To determine the severing rate from imaging of single filaments, we measured the total length of the actin polymer in a field using a custom routine in Matlab (R2011b; The Mathworks, Inc.). Severing rates are thus reported as the number of events per second over the time course of the experiment normalized to the starting total length of actin in micrometers. To determine whether severed actin filaments produced barbed ends capable of seeding actin polymerization, a solution of 10 μm unlabeled F-actin was mixed with an equal volume of Assay Buffer containing 6 μm CAP and 4 μm cofilin at pH 7.4 or 6 μm CAP at pH 6. After incubating at room temperature for 5 min, this solution was diluted 1:20 into a solution of 2 μm G-actin labeled with pyrene (25% label) and Assay Buffer at pH 7.4 with or without 300 nm cytochalasin D. Pyrene fluorescence was monitored in a Spectromax M2 plate reader. We have previously demonstrated that cofilin, coronin, and AIP1 are each necessary and together are sufficient to disassemble the actin comet tails assembled by L. monocytogenes in our perfusion chamber setup despite the presence of a physiological excess of G-actin (13Brieher W.M. Kueh H.Y. Ballif B.A. Mitchison T.J. Rapid actin monomer-insensitive depolymerization of Listeria actin comet tails by cofilin, coronin, and Aip1.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, it is also true that high concentrations of F-actin exist in vivo (14Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Molecular mechanisms controlling actin filament dynamics in nonmuscle cells.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). To address the question of whether cofilin, coronin, and AIP1 would retain efficacy in the face of a physiological excess of F-actin, we assessed whether this ternary mixture could still disassemble fluorescent actin comet tails in the presence of unlabeled prepolymerized F-actin. After assembling fluorescent comet tails in a perfusion chamber, we perfused a limiting amount of cofilin (2 μm) with saturating amounts (13Brieher W.M. Kueh H.Y. Ballif B.A. Mitchison T.J. Rapid actin monomer-insensitive depolymerization of Listeria actin comet tails by cofilin, coronin, and Aip1.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) of coronin (2 μm) and AIP1 (0.2 μm) into the chamber along with varying concentrations of prepolymerized F-actin. Although sufficient to disassemble actin comet tails in the presence of G-actin, the activity of the cofilin, coronin, and AIP1 mixture was inhibited by the presence of F-actin (Fig. 1A) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). A high speed supernatant from bovine thymus extract rescued this inhibition, implying that an additional actin disassembly factor was present in the extract (Fig. 1B). This activity can be chromatographically separated from each of the three known factors in the extract, first from coronin and AIP1 by flowing through DE52 beads and then from cofilin by flowing through an S column at physiological pH, thus indicating that this activity is a fourth actin disassembly factor that restores actin disassembly activity under conditions of physiological F-actin (Table 1).TABLE 1Purification of cyclase-associated proteinColumnTotal proteinProtein concentrationTotal activitySpecific activitymgmg/mlunitsunits/mgDE521,3201120,00018pH 6.8 S9156.19,0009.7pH 6.0 S1113.16,00054HAP/S2003.81.92,000526Heparin1.21.2667556 Open table in a new tab To identify the factor responsible for ameliorating the observed F-actin mediated inhibition of actin substrate disassembly, we continued to test the activity of our ternary actin disassembly mixture (cofilin, AIP1, and coronin) in the presence of both excess F-actin and chromatographic fractions from thymus extract. The activity behaved as a single factor through multiple chromatographic steps (Table 1) resulting in the purification of two bands of 57 and 43 kDa (Fig. 2A). The 43-kDa band was identified by mass spectrometry as actin, and the 57-kDa band was identified as CAP. We expressed the human CAP isoform with the widest tissue distribution (CAP1; hereafter “CAP”) (22Swiston J. Hubberstey A. Yu G. Young D. Differential expression of CAP and CAP2 in adult rat tissues.Gene. 1995; 165: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recombinant human CAP scored as the factor responsible for imparting resistance to excess F-actin, allowing cofilin, coronin, and AIP1 to efficiently depolymerize Listeria actin comet tails despite the presence of inhibiting levels of F-actin (Fig. 2B). Under the challenges of excess F-actin concentrations, recombinant CAP proved necessary to depolymerize fluorescent actin comet tails, and all four factors (cofilin, coronin, AIP1, and CAP) were together sufficient for actin disassembly (Fig. 2C). CAP has already been implicated in actin turnover dynamics and is known to accelerate the release of cofilin from its high affinity interaction with ADP·G-actin for another round of disassembly (23Ressad F.

A genome-wide screening of transcriptome dysregulation between cancer and normal tissue would provide insight into the molecular basis of CRC initiation and progression. Compared with microarray technology, which is commonly used to identify transcriptional changes, the recently developed RNA-seq technique has the ability to detect other abnormal regulations in the cancer transcriptome, such as alternative splicing, novel transcripts or gene fusion. In this study, we performed high-throughput transcriptome sequencing at ∼50× coverage on CRC, adjacent non-tumor and distant normal tissue. The results revealed cancer-specific, differentially expressed genes and differential alternative splicing, suggesting that the extracellular matrix and metabolic pathways are activated and the genes related to cell homeostasis are suppressed in CRC. In addition, one tumor-restricted gene fusion, PRTEN-NOTCH2, was also detected and experimentally confirmed. This study reveals some common features in tumor invasion and provides a comprehensive survey of the CRC transcriptome, which provides better insight into the complexity of regulatory changes during tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1966709195,"4-Thiouridine (s(4)U) is a conserved modified nucleotide at position 8 of bacterial and archaeal tRNAs and plays a role in protecting cells from near-UV killing. Escherichia coli employs the following two enzymes for its synthesis: the cysteine desulfurase IscS, which forms a Cys persulfide enzyme adduct from free Cys; and ThiI, which adenylates U8 and transfers sulfur from IscS to form s(4)U. The C-terminal rhodanese-like domain (RLD) of ThiI is responsible for the sulfurtransferase activity. The mechanism of s(4)U biosynthesis in archaea is not known as many archaea lack cysteine desulfurase and an RLD of the putative ThiI. Using the methanogenic archaeon Methanococcus maripaludis, we show that deletion of ThiI (MMP1354) abolished the biosynthesis of s(4)U but not of thiamine. MMP1354 complements an Escherichia coli ΔthiI mutant for s(4)U formation, indicating that MMP1354 is sufficient for sulfur incorporation into s(4)U. In the absence of an RLD, MMP1354 uses Cys(265) and Cys(268) located in the PP-loop pyrophosphatase domain to generate persulfide and disulfide intermediates for sulfur transfer. In vitro assays suggest that S(2-) is a physiologically relevant sulfur donor for s(4)U formation catalyzed by MMP1354 (K(m) for Na(2)S is ∼1 mm). Thus, methanogenic archaea developed a strategy for sulfur incorporation into s(4)U that differs from bacteria; this may be an adaptation to life in sulfide-rich environments."

However, Aurora-A is not required for KIBRA to associate with Lats2. We also found that Lats2 inhibits the Aurora-mediated phosphorylation of KIBRA on Ser539, probably via regulating protein phosphatase 1. Consistent with playing a role in mitosis, siRNA-mediated knockdown of KIBRA causes mitotic abnormalities, including defects of spindle and centrosome formation and chromosome misalignment.

https://openalex.org/W1977961267,"Self-facilitation through ecosystem engineering (i.e., organism modification of the abiotic environment) and consumer-resource interactions are both major determinants of spatial patchiness in ecosystems. However, interactive effects of these two mechanisms on spatial complexity have not been extensively studied. We investigated the mechanisms underlying a spatial mosaic of low-tide exposed hummocks and waterlogged hollows on an intertidal mudflat in the Wadden Sea dominated by the seagrass Zostera noltii. A combination of field measurements, an experiment and a spatially explicit model indicated that the mosaic resulted from localized sediment accretion by seagrass followed by selective waterfowl grazing. Hollows were bare in winter, but were rapidly colonized by seagrass during the growth season. Colonized hollows were heavily grazed by brent geese and widgeon in autumn, converting these patches to a bare state again and disrupting sediment accretion by seagrass. In contrast, hummocks were covered by seagrass throughout the year and were rarely grazed, most likely because the waterfowl were not able to employ their preferred but water requiring feeding strategy (‘dabbling’) here. Our study exemplifies that interactions between ecosystem engineering by a foundation species (seagrass) and consumption (waterfowl grazing) can increase spatial complexity at the landscape level."
https://openalex.org/W1990853209,"Case studies of land use change have suggested that deforestation across Southern Mexico is accelerating. However, forest transition theory predicts that trajectories of change can be modified by economic factors, leading to spatial and temporal heterogeneity in rates of change that may take the form of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). This study aimed to assess the evidence regarding potential forest transition in Southern Mexico by classifying regional forest cover change using Landsat imagery from 1990 through to 2006. Patterns of forest cover change were found to be complex and non-linear. When rates of forest loss were averaged over 342 municipalities using mixed-effects modelling the results showed a significant (p<0.001) overall reduction of the mean rate of forest loss from 0.85% per year in the 1990-2000 period to 0.67% in the 2000-2006 period. The overall regional annual rate of deforestation has fallen from 0.33% to 0.28% from the 1990s to 2000s. A high proportion of the spatial variability in forest cover change cannot be explained statistically. However analysis using spline based general additive models detected underlying relationships between forest cover and income or population density of a form consistent with the EKC. The incipient forest transition has not, as yet, resulted in widespread reforestation. Forest recovery remains below 0.20% per year. Reforestation is mostly the result of passive processes associated with reductions in the intensity of land use. Deforestation continues to occur at high rates in some focal areas. A transition could be accelerated if there were a broader recognition among policy makers that the regional rate of forest loss has now begun to fall. The changing trajectory provides an opportunity to actively restore forest cover through stimulating afforestation and stimulating more sustainable land use practices. The results have clear implications for policy aimed at carbon sequestration through reducing deforestation and enhancing forest growth."
https://openalex.org/W2113208308,"In this study we have constructed a mathematical model of a recently proposed functional model known to be responsible for inducing waking, NREMS and REMS. Simulation studies using this model reproduced sleep-wake patterns as reported in normal animals. The model helps to explain neural mechanism(s) that underlie the transitions between wake, NREMS and REMS as well as how both the homeostatic sleep-drive and the circadian rhythm shape the duration of each of these episodes. In particular, this mathematical model demonstrates and confirms that an underlying mechanism for REMS generation is pre-synaptic inhibition from substantia nigra onto the REM-off terminals that project on REM-on neurons, as has been recently proposed. The importance of orexinergic neurons in stabilizing the wake-sleep cycle is demonstrated by showing how even small changes in inputs to or from those neurons can have a large impact on the ensuing dynamics. The results from this model allow us to make predictions of the neural mechanisms of regulation and patho-physiology of REMS."
https://openalex.org/W2092830404,"Vigorous debates as to the evolutionary origins of culture remain unresolved due to an absence of methods for identifying learning mechanisms in natural populations. While laboratory experiments on captive animals have revealed evidence for a number of mechanisms, these may not necessarily reflect the processes typically operating in nature. We developed a novel method that allows social and asocial learning mechanisms to be determined in animal groups from the patterns of interaction with, and solving of, a task. We deployed it to analyse learning in groups of wild meerkats (Suricata suricatta) presented with a novel foraging apparatus. We identify nine separate learning processes underlying the meerkats' foraging behaviour, in each case precisely quantifying their strength and duration, including local enhancement, emulation, and a hitherto unrecognized form of social learning, which we term 'observational perseverance'. Our analysis suggests a key factor underlying the stability of behavioural traditions is a high ratio of specific to generalized social learning effects. The approach has widespread potential as an ecologically valid tool to investigate learning mechanisms in natural groups of animals, including humans."
https://openalex.org/W2033975929,"Protein S-palmitoylation is a posttranslational modification in which a palmitoyl group is added to a protein via a thioester linkage on cysteine. Palmitoylation is a reversible modification involved in protein membrane targeting, receptor trafficking and signaling, vesicular biogenesis and trafficking, protein aggregation, and protein degradation. An example of the dynamic nature of this modification is the palmitoylation-depalmitoylation cycle that regulates the subcellular trafficking of Ras family GTPases. The Ras protein acyltransferase (PAT) consists of a complex of Erf2-Erf4 and DHHC9-GCP16 in yeast and mammalian cells, respectively. Both subunits are required for PAT activity, but the function of the Erf4 and Gcp16 subunits has not been established. This study elucidates the function of Erf4 and shows that one role of Erf4 is to regulate Erf2 stability through an ubiquitin-mediated pathway. In addition, Erf4 is required for the stable formation of the palmitoyl-Erf2 intermediate, the first step of palmitoyl transfer to protein substrates. In the absence of Erf4, the rate of hydrolysis of the active site palmitoyl thioester intermediate is increased, resulting in reduced palmitoyl transfer to a Ras2 substrate. This is the first demonstration of regulation of a DHHC PAT enzyme by an associated protein."

In vivo, microtubules are protected from ice-cold induced depolymerization by the widely expressed MAP6/STOP family of proteins. However, the mechanism by which MAP6 stabilizes microtubules at 4 °C has not been identified. Moreover, the microtubule cold sensitivity and therefore the needs for microtubule stabilization in the wide range of temperatures between 4 and 37 °C are unknown. This is of importance as body temperatures of animals can drop during hibernation or torpor covering a large range of temperatures. Here, we show that in the absence of MAP6, microtubules in cells below 20 °C rapidly depolymerize in a temperature-dependent manner whereas they are stabilized in the presence of MAP6. We further show that in cells, MAP6-F binding to and stabilization of microtubules is temperature- dependent and very dynamic, suggesting a direct effect of the temperature on the formation of microtubule/MAP6 complex. We also demonstrate using purified proteins that MAP6-F binds directly to microtubules through its Mc domain.

Physiol. 1997; 118: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The amino acid substitutions affect residues located at sites implicated in tubulin lateral contact and are thought to increase interactions between protofilaments (12Detrich 3rd, H.W. Parker S.K.

Among endotherms that contain cold-sensitive microtubules, some may undergo a significant drop in their body temperature during natural events. Indeed, during hibernation or torpor, body temperature can decrease by several degrees down to temperatures close to 0 °C depending on the species (13Geiser F.

During such events, the maintenance of a minimal network of microtubules is thought to be required for basal cellular functions. It has been shown that the main proteins able to protect microtubules against cold-induced depolymerization are the microtubule-associated proteins MAP6 3The abbreviations used are: MAPmicrotubule-associated proteinMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastsPIPESpiperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)EMelectron microscopy.

Depending on mouse strains, MAP6 isoforms contain a Mc domain composed of a 4 or 5 times tandemly repeated 46-residue motif. This Mc domain, when overexpressed in HeLa cells (that do not express any MAP6 variants), is able to stabilize microtubules against exposure to 4 °C (22Bosc C. Frank R. Denarier E. Ronjat M.

In these cells, at 37 °C, microtubules are dynamic, non stable (as revealed by nocodazole sensitivity) (23Lieuvin A. Labbé J.C. Dorée M. Job D. Intrinsic microtubule stability in interphase cells.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) whereas they are stable at 4 °C. Concomitantly, MAP6-F relocalizes from the cytosol at 37 °C to the microtubule network upon chilling at 4 °C (16Denarier E. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Bosc C. Pirollet F. Chapel A. Margolis R.L. Job D. Nonneuronal isoforms of STOP protein are responsible for microtubule cold stability in mammalian fibroblasts.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 6055-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These data suggest that microtubule stabilization by MAP6-F is dependent on the binding of MAP6-F to the microtubules. However, the cold sensitivity of cellular microtubules to temperatures between 37 and 4 °C and the effect of these temperatures on MAP6 binding to microtubules were unclear. Moreover, the exact mechanisms involved in the regulation of MAP6 interaction with microtubules under cold exposure have yet to be identified. Here, we show that in the absence of MAP6, cellular microtubules depolymerize in a temperature-dependent manner as soon as the temperature decreases below 20 °C. In fibroblasts, which contain MAP6-F, microtubule cold resistance is directly correlated with a rapid and temperature-dependent interaction of MAP6-F with the microtubules. Using purified in vitro systems, we provide evidence that MAP6-F stabilizes microtubules via a direct interaction through its Mc domain. Furthermore, we found structural changes in the MAP6 Mc domain upon temperature modifications, indicating that MAP6 behaves as a “temperature-sensor” adapting its conformation to allow microtubule binding and preservation upon temperature drop. Mouse fibroblastic NIH/3T3 cells were grown at 37 °C in DMEM 4.5 g/liter glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories Inc.), 50 units/ml of penicillin and 50 μg of streptomycin (Invitrogen).

For immunofluorescence analysis of cellular microtubule content, cells were plated 24 to 48 h before analysis on glass coverslips placed in B60 cell culture dishes. For analysis of time- and temperature-dependent effects on cellular microtubule content, coverslips were placed in culture medium complemented with 10 mm HEPES pH 7.4 in P24 culture dishes whose temperature was pre-equilibrated in water baths. For short incubation times of 1 min or less, incubations were done in PBS instead of culture medium. At the end of the indicated time, cells were washed with PBS at the incubation temperature and then permeabilized to wash out the soluble cell content through two 30 s incubations in OPT buffer (100 mm PIPES/KOH pH 6.75, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100) at the incubation temperature. Cells were then fixed in −20 °C methanol and processed for immunodetection. For immunofluorescence analysis of MAP6-dependent microtubule cold stability, NIH/3T3 cells on coverslips were treated as described above except that cells were permeabilized and washed (2 × 30 s) in PEMT buffer (OPT buffer without glycerol) at the incubation temperature and then dipped in 4 °C PEMT buffer for 10 min before methanol fixation. Methanol-fixed cells were incubated for 30 min in PBST (PBS buffer plus 0.3% Tween 20) plus 5% (v/v) of normal goat serum (NGS). Mouse monoclonal anti-tubulin α3a1 antibody (24Erck C. Peris L.

Coverslips were washed five times with PBST and then incubated for 45 min with Alexa488-coupled anti-mouse secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Coverslips were washed five times with PBST, once with PBS, incubated for 15 min with PBS containing 100 ng/ml of Hoechst 33258, briefly rinsed with PBS, ethanol dried, and mounted on glass slides using DAKO mounting medium. Images were acquired using Axioskop 50 (Carl Zeiss Micro Imaging) microscope and Metamorph (Universal Imaging Corp.) software. For microtubule quantification, at least 12 pictures of 30 to 50 cells were taken for each condition. The surface covered by microtubules was quantified using ImageJ software (25Schneider C.A. Rasband W.S. Eliceiri K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (34949) Google Scholar) and reported to the number of cells in each corresponding picture. Statistical analysis and graphs were made using Excel software (Microsoft). MEF cells grown on coverslips were placed in culture medium complemented with 10 mm HEPES pH 7.4 and either kept at 37 °C or incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were permeabilized in OPT buffer and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, 0.5% glutaraldehyde, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, followed by a treatment with 1 mg/ml NaBH4 in PBS for 10 min. Tubulin was detected using α3A1 antibody (1/1,000) and MAP6-F with polyclonal 23C antibody (1/1,000). Images were recorded with an Axioskop 20 microscope (Carl Zeiss) (Leica) coupled with Coolnaps ES camera (Roper Scientific) driven by Metaview Software (Universal Imaging). pmCherry-C2 vector was obtained by replacing the EGFP sequence of pEGFP-C2 vector (Clontech) by the mCherry sequence from pmCherry-C1 (Clontech) using AgeI/BsrG1 cloning sites. mCherry-MAP6-F expression vector was then constructed by inserting MAP6-F cDNA from p16C-APa (16Denarier E. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Bosc C. Pirollet F. Chapel A. Margolis R.L. Job D. Nonneuronal isoforms of STOP protein are responsible for microtubule cold stability in mammalian fibroblasts.Proc. Natl. Acad.

HeLa cells transfected with pmCherry-MAP6-F using Amaxa technology (Lonza) were grown on coverslip for 24 h and then placed in a perfusion chamber at 37 °C. Cell culture medium was progressively cooled from 37 °C to 15 °C during the course of the experiment (15 min). Images were recorded every minute on a DMI6000 microscope (Leica) with an EMCCD Quantem camera (Roper Scientific) driven by MetaMorph Software (Universal Imaging). For analysis of the temperature-dependent solubility of MAP6-F in NIH/3T3 cells, cells were grown in B35 cell culture dishes. The cell culture medium was renewed with the same medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES pH 7.4, equilibrated at the temperature of the assay and the culture dishes were placed in a temperature-controlled water bath. For incubation times of 1 min or less, PBS was used instead of cell culture medium. Dishes were incubated in water bath at the temperature and for the time indicated. Dishes were rinsed with 1 ml of PBS at incubation temperature and permeabilized with 400 μl of OPT at the incubation temperature. After 1 min, OPT medium was recovered and added to 100 μl of 5× Laemmli buffer (soluble extract). Insoluble cell material was recovered in 500 μl of 1× Laemmli buffer. Extracts were run on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TTBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.3% Tween 20). Membranes were probed in the same buffer with affinity-purified rabbit anti-MAP6 antibody 23C (dilution 1/5,000) or monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody α3a1 (1/10,000). HRP-coupled secondary antibodies were incubated in TTBS and probed using Pierce ECL Substrate (ThermoScientific) and light sensitive film (Fischer Scientific). Cells grown on B30 cultures dishes were washed with PBS and lysed by addition of 400 μl of Laemmli buffer. Extracts were normalized for the quantity of tubulin by semi-quantitative Western blot using α3A1 antibody. MAP6 proteins expression was then analyzed by Western blot as described above using a mixture of both anti-MAP6 23N and 23C polyclonal antibodies at 1/5,000 dilution each. MAP6-F was cloned into pFAST-BAC HTb as previously reported (22Bosc C. Frank R. Denarier E. Ronjat M. Schweitzer A. Wehland J. Job D.

The Mc domain coding sequences were cloned into NcoI/XhoI cloning sites of pFAST-BAC HTb in frame with the His6 tag. Recombinant baculoviruses were obtained and amplified in Sf9 insect cells (Invitrogen). Protein expressions were carried out in High Five insect cells grown in suspension in Express Five culture medium (Invitrogen). For His-tagged MAP6-F purification, 500 ml of infected High Five cell culture were spun down at 4 °C for 5 min at 125 × g. Pellets were frozen and thawed in 50 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm PIPES-KOH pH 6.6, 150 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA 0.1 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml AEBSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml E64. Cells were lyzed by passing three times through a 23-gauge needle and cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C and 30,000 × g. Supernatant was diluted with one volume of Q-Sepharose-adjusting buffer (100 mm HEPES pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.9% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT plus protease inhibitors and centrifuged at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto a 25 ml Q-Sepharose column equilibrated in Q buffer (100 mm HEPES-KOH pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT). Flow through and 25 ml wash with Q buffer were collected, mixed with 1 volume of Ni-Sepharose adjustment buffer (60 mm imidazole pH 8.0, 900 mm KCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20% sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors) and incubated at 4 °C for 90 min with 1 ml of Ni-Sepharose beads previously equilibrated in Ni column buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH pH 8.0, 500 mm KCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% sucrose, 50 mm Imidazole, 0.1 mm DTT). Beads were spun down at 100 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed twice with Ni-column buffer, and packed in a disposable plastic column. The column was further washed with Ni-column buffer, equilibrated in equilibration buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH pH 8.0, 250 mm KCl, 0.1 mm DTT, 50 mm imidazole), and the protein was eluted with equilibration buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Purified His-tagged MAP6-F was extensively dialyzed against PEM buffer, aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Protein purity was analyzed on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE. Quantification was made with ImageJ and Excel softwares from scanned gel using bovine serum albumin as standard. For His-Mc domain purification, a 50 ml culture of infected High Five cells was spun down and frozen as indicated above. Cells were lysed in 10 ml of buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors), and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was heated at 90 °C for 15 min, cooled on ice, and centrifuged again. The supernatant was adjusted to 2.5 mm of imidazole and loaded on a 1 ml cobalt column (Pierce) connected to Duo Flow apparatus (Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated in buffer A (20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm imidazole). Column was washed with 20 ml of Buffer A and the proteins were eluted using a 2.5 to 200 mm imidazole gradient. Fractions with the Mc domain were pooled, concentrated with Ultracel-10K (Millipore), loaded on a S200 gel-filtration column equilibrated in 2× BRB buffer (160 mm PIPES pH 6.75, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2). Elution fractions were analyzed, diluted with one volume of water, reconcentrated with Ultracel-10K, aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. For circular dichroism experiments, the buffer containing the Mc domain was changed to 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.75) through repeated concentrations and dilution steps with Ultracel-10K. Microtubules were polymerized from 50 μm brain bovine PC-tubulin prepared as published (26Paturle-Lafanechère L. Eddé B. Denoulet P. Van Dorsselaer A. Mazarguil H. Le Caer J.P. Wehland J. Job D. Characterization of a major brain tubulin variant which cannot be tyrosinated.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10523-10528Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Tubulin was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in PEM buffer (100 mm PIPES pH 6.75, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with 1 mm of GTP. Mixture was further incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence of Taxol (100 μm) and then diluted to 2 μm final concentration of tubulin. Five μl of microtubule solution were incubated with 5 μl of various concentrations of the Mc domain in PEM buffer plus 0.05% Tween 20 and 1 mm DTT. After 10 min at the indicated temperature, microtubules were sedimented through centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min at the incubation temperature. Pellets were recovered in 80 μl of Laemmli buffer. Fifteen μl of each fraction were loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE gels. After migration, 2 gel bands were cut from each gel. The first at 45/60 kDa was Coomassie Blue stained to verify the even quantity of tubulin present in the assay. The second, at 30–45 kDa was transferred onto a single nitrocellulose membrane at 100 V for 1 h in transfer buffer containing 20% ethanol and 0.05% SDS. The Mc domain detection was carried out as described for Western blot detection of MAP6-F except that pico-ECL kit (Pierce) was used, and the signal was recorded with Chemidoc apparatus (Bio-Rad). Signal intensities were quantified with ImageJ software, and the corresponding amount of protein present in the extract was determined by comparison with the ECL signal obtained with a ladder of given quantity of the protein using Excel software. Microtubules were polymerized from 60 μm of bovin brain tubulin in PEM buffer plus 1 μm GTP at 37 °C for 30 min. Three μl of microtubule solution were mixed with 3 μl of PEM solution containing either 100 μm taxol or increasing concentration of purified MAP6-F or Mc domain and incubated on ice for 10 min. Five μl of the mix were loaded on 100 μl of a 30% sucrose cushion in PEM buffer, centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellets were recovered in Laemmli buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Microtubules were grown from 80 μm of bovine brain tubulin in PEM-GTP buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. Microtubules were then diluted at 37 °C to 55 μm either with PEM buffer alone or supplemented with the Mc domain (5.5 μm final concentration). After 10 min at 37 °C, the mixes were incubated on ice for either 1 min in the control condition (rapid depolymerization) or for 20 min when microtubules were stabilized by the Mc domain. Five μl of chilled mixes were loaded onto holey carbon-coated grids, briefly blotted and plunged into liquid ethane using the vitrification robot Vitrobot MARK IV (FEI Co.). Specimens were observed with a Phillips CM200 using a Gatan G26 cryoholder. Images were recorded on Kodak SO163 films under low dose conditions at defocus in the range of 2 to 3 μm and at a magnification of ×27,500. Micrographs were digitized with an Epson scanner at 1600 dpi. Forty μl of PEM buffer containing 1 μg of MAP6-F were either kept on ice or incubated for 30 min at 90 °C. Heated solutions were cooled down on ice and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were recovered and mixed with 10 μl of 5× Laemmli buffer, while pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli buffer. As control for the total amount of MAP6-F, 40 μl of non-centrifuged protein solution were treated as described for the supernatants. Protein solutions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 12% gel and Coomassie Blue staining. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded with a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter interfaced with a Peltier temperature control unit. The Mc domain concentration was 9 μm in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 6.75. The path length of the cuvette was 1 mm. Thermal folding was followed by monitoring the CD signal at 220 nm and 208 nm while changing the temperature from 5 to 80 °C by 1 °C steps. The structural changes observed while varying the temperature was emphasized by subtracting the CD spectrum at 5 °C from the CD spectra obtained at given temperatures. Previous experiments have shown that in HeLa cells that do not express MAP6 proteins, microtubules depolymerize when incubated on ice for a prolonged time (23Lieuvin A. Labbé J.C. Dorée M. Job D. Intrinsic microtubule stability in interphase cells.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, no data were available on the effect of moderate chilling conditions on microtubules. To assess the effect of intermediate drops in temperature on cellular microtubules, we incubated HeLa cells grown on coverslips at temperatures varying from 37 to 4 °C before rapid permeabilization and fixation (23Lieuvin A. Labbé J.C. Dorée M. Job D. Intrinsic microtubule stability in interphase cells.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The remaining microtubules were observed and quantified (Fig. 1, A and B). The quantity of microtubules was constant for temperatures above 25 °C. This quantity then progressively decreased with lower temperatures to reach a very low level at 4 °C. Similar results were obtained with mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from MAP6-null mice (MEF−/−) (Fig. 1, A and C) albeit with stronger chilling effect on microtubules. In MEF−/−, significant microtubule loss appeared below 25–20 °C with a rapid drop between 20 and 15 °C with only about 20% of microtubule left and a complete microtubule depolymerization below 10 °C (Fig. 1C)"
https://openalex.org/W2064600878,"Fifty years ago, FitzHugh introduced a phase portrait that became famous for a twofold reason: it captured in a physiological way the qualitative behavior of Hodgkin-Huxley model and it revealed the power of simple dynamical models to unfold complex firing patterns. To date, in spite of the enormous progresses in qualitative and quantitative neural modeling, this phase portrait has remained a core picture of neuronal excitability. Yet, a major difference between the neurophysiology of 1961 and of 2011 is the recognition of the prominent role of calcium channels in firing mechanisms. We show that including this extra current in Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics leads to a revision of FitzHugh-Nagumo phase portrait that affects in a fundamental way the reduced modeling of neural excitability. The revisited model considerably enlarges the modeling power of the original one. In particular, it captures essential electrophysiological signatures that otherwise require non-physiological alteration or considerable complexification of the classical model. As a basic illustration, the new model is shown to highlight a core dynamical mechanism by which calcium channels control the two distinct firing modes of thalamocortical neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2057156972,"Theory predicts the evolution of alternative male social tactics when intense competition coupled with the superior competitive ability of some individuals limits access to reproductive opportunities by others. How selection has shaped alternative social tactics may be especially interesting in long-lived species where size among sexually mature males varies markedly. We conducted experimental studies on long-lived eastern Australian water dragons living where competition was intense to test the hypotheses that mature males adopt alternative social tactics that are plastic, and that large size and body condition determine resource-holding potential. Approximately one-half of mature males (N = 14) defended territories using high rates of patrol and advertisement display, whereas 16 smaller mature males having lower body condition indices utilized non-territorial social tactics. Although territorial males were larger in absolute size and head dimensions, their heads were not allometrically larger. Territorial males advertised very frequently using displays involving stereotypical movements of the head and dewlap. More aggressive displays were given infrequently during baseline social conditions, but increased during periods of social instability. Female home ranges overlapped those of several territorial and non-territorial males, but females interacted more frequently with territorial males. The extreme plasticity of social tactics in this species that are dependent on body size was confirmed by two instances when relatively large non-territorial males spontaneously evicted territory owners, and by marked shifts in tactics by non-territorial males in response to temporary experimental removals of territory owners, followed (usually) by their expulsion when original owners were reinstated. The high level of social plasticity in this population where same-sex competitors are densely concentrated in preferred habitat suggests that chronic high energetic costs of defense may select for males to cycle between territorial and non-territorial social tactics depending upon their changing energetic status and their current capacity for competition with rivals."
https://openalex.org/W1990587141,"The advances in proteomics technologies offer an unprecedented opportunity and valuable resources to understand how living organisms execute necessary functions at systems levels. However, little work has been done up to date to utilize the highly accurate spatio-temporal dynamic proteome data generated by phosphoprotemics for mathematical modeling of complex cell signaling pathways. This work proposed a novel computational framework to develop mathematical models based on proteomic datasets. Using the MAP kinase pathway as the test system, we developed a mathematical model including the cytosolic and nuclear subsystems; and applied the genetic algorithm to infer unknown model parameters. Robustness property of the mathematical model was used as a criterion to select the appropriate rate constants from the estimated candidates. Quantitative information regarding the absolute protein concentrations was used to refine the mathematical model. We have demonstrated that the incorporation of more experimental data could significantly enhance both the simulation accuracy and robustness property of the proposed model. In addition, we used the MAP kinase pathway inhibited by phosphatases with different concentrations to predict the signal output influenced by different cellular conditions. Our predictions are in good agreement with the experimental observations when the MAP kinase pathway was inhibited by phosphatase PP2A and MKP3. The successful application of the proposed modeling framework to the MAP kinase pathway suggests that our method is very promising for developing accurate mathematical models and yielding insights into the regulatory mechanisms of complex cell signaling pathways."

NaPi-2b is regulated by changes in dietary Pi but the mechanisms underlying this regulation are largely undetermined. Sequence analyses show NaPi-2b has a PDZ binding motif at its C terminus. Immunofluorescence imaging shows NaPi-2b and two PDZ domain containing proteins, NHERF1 and PDZK1, are expressed in the apical microvillar domain of rat small intestine enterocytes. Co-immunoprecipitation studies in rat enterocytes show that NHERF1 associates with NaPi-2b but not PDZK1. In HEK co-expression studies, GFP-NaPi-2b co-precipitates with FLAG-NHERF1. This interaction is markedly diminished when the C-terminal four amino acids are truncated from NaPi-2b. FLIM-FRET analyses using tagged proteins in CACO-2BBE cells show a distinct phasor shift between NaPi-2b and NHERF1 but not between NaPi-2b and the PDZK1 pair. This shift demonstrates that NaPi-2b and NHERF1 reside within 10 nm of each other. NHERF1−/− mice, but not PDZK1−/− mice, had a diminished adaptation of NaPi-2b expression in response to a low Pi diet. Together these studies demonstrate that NHERF1 associates with NaPi-2b in enterocytes and regulates NaPi-2b adaptation.

Phosphate (Pi) is a key component of biological systems involved in a variety of physiologic processes including energy metabolism, cell signaling, nucleotide and phospholipids biosynthesis, and bone mineralization (1Berndt T. Kumar R. Novel mechanisms in the regulation of phosphorus homeostasis.Physiology. 2009; 24: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Serum Pi levels are maintained within a narrow range and deviation from these levels has significant pathological consequences. Hypophosphatemia leads to rickets and brittle bones in a number of inherited syndromes (2Alizadeh Naderi A.S. Reilly R.F. Hereditary disorders of renal phosphate wasting.Nat. Rev.

Pi homeostasis reflects the balance between intestinal absorption, renal reabsorption, deposition in bone, and cellular uptake. The type II family of sodium-dependent phosphate co-transporters (NaPi) plays key roles in both the kidney and the small intestine. In the renal proximal tubule, NaPi-2a (SLC34a1) and NaPi-2c (SLC34a3) are expressed in the apical membrane of the proximal tubule where they perform the bulk of the renal Pi reabsorption. Both renal transporters are regulated in response to chronic and acute changes in dietary Pi content, metabolic conditions, and hormones, including parathyroid hormone and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) (7Kempson S.A. Lötscher M. Kaissling B. Biber J. Murer H. Levi M. Parathyroid hormone action on phosphate transporter mRNA and protein in rat renal proximal tubules.Am. J.

Similar to the renal adaptation of NaPi-2a and NaPi-2c, NaPi-2b activity is regulated in response to both acute and chronic changes in dietary Pi intake (11Marks J. Srai S.K. Biber J. Murer H.

Mice chronically fed a low Pi diet have an increased apical expression of NaPi-2b transporter in enterocytes and an up-regulation of Pi uptake (13Hattenhauer O. Traebert M. Murer H. Biber J.

Significant advances in delineating the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the regulation of the renal transporters, especially NaPi-2a, have been made over the last decade. The primary mechanism of regulating NaPi-2a and NaPi-2c activity is via modulation of the abundance of NaPi protein in the apical membrane of proximal tubule cells (14Forster I.C. Hernando N.

The interactions of NaPi-2a and NaPi-2c with PDZ (PSD-95, Dlg, ZO-1) domain-containing proteins play pivotal roles in directing the retention versus recovery of these transporters at the apical membrane. PDZ is one of the most extended protein-protein interaction domains found in mammalian proteins involved in an increasing number of cellular functions including the regulation of epithelial transporters (16Nourry C. Grant S.G. Borg J.P. PDZ domain proteins. Plug and play!.Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: RE7Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 17Sugiura T. Shimizu T. Kijima A. Minakata S. Kato Y. PDZ adaptors. Their regulation of epithelial transporters and involvement in human diseases.J. Pharm. Sci. 2011; 100: 3620-3635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). PDZ domains are modules consisting of 80–100 amino acid residues that generate an hydrophobic pocket that is able to fit specific sequences (PDZ-binding motifs), usually located at the C-terminal tail of many proteins (18Lee H.J. Zheng J.J. PDZ domains and their binding partners. Structure, specificity, and modification.Cell Commun. Signal. 2010; 8: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). NaPi-2a binds and is regulated by several PDZ proteins, including NHERF1 (also known as EBP50), NHERF-2 (also known as E3KARP), PDZK1 (also known as NHERF-3, CAP70, NaPi-Cap1), PDZK2 (also known as NHERF-4, NaPi-Cap2), and Shank2 (19Gisler S.M.

However, NaPi-2c interactions have only been demonstrated with PDZK1 and, to a lesser extent, with NHERF1 (22Villa-Bellosta R. Barac-Nieto M. Breusegem S.Y. Barry N.P. Levi M. Sorribas V.

Highlighting the functional significance of these interactions, NHERF1−/− mice have a marked redistribution of NaPi-2a from the apical microvilli into the cell interior and distinct increased urinary Pi excretion that results from the loss of NaPi-2a activity in the renal proximal tubule cells (24Shenolikar S. Voltz J.W. Minkoff C.M. Wade J.B. Weinman E.J. Targeted disruption of the mouse NHERF-1 gene promotes internalization of proximal tubule sodium-phosphate cotransporter type IIa and renal phosphate wasting.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11470-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). PDKZ1−/− mice showed milder effects on the regulation of NaPi-2a only under high Pi diet adaptation with lower levels of protein, paralleled with increased urinary fractional Pi excretion (25Capuano P.

However, the up-regulation of NaPi-2c apical protein in response to a low Pi diet was blunted in the PDZK1−/− mice, suggesting an important role of PDZK1 on the stabilization of NaPi-2c (23Giral H. Lanzano L. Caldas Y. Blaine J. Verlander J.W. Lei T. Gratton E. Levi M. Role of PDZK1 protein in apical membrane expression of renal sodium-coupled phosphate transporters.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 15032-15042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast to regulation of renal Pi transport, the regulatory mechanisms controlling the intestinal absorption of Pi have not been studied in detail and are still largely unknown. Interestingly, intestinal NaPi-2b transporter contains a PDZ-binding motif consensus sequence at its C terminus, but at the present time no reports have described its interactions with PDZ proteins. Given the established role of NHERF1 and PDZK1 in binding and moderating the activity of other NaPi type II family members, the present study seeks to determine whether NHERF1 and PDZK1 bind and modulate the activity of NaPi-2b in small intestinal enterocytes. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma except when noted. The polyclonal rabbit anti-NaPi-2b antibody was custom generated by Davids Biotechnologie (Regensburg, Germany) as described before (12Giral H. Caldas Y. Sutherland E. Wilson P. Breusegem S. Barry N. Blaine J. Jiang T. Wang X.X. Levi M. Regulation of rat intestinal sodium-dependent phosphate transporters by dietary phosphate.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2009; 297: F1466-F1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). NHERF1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and PDZK1 mouse monoclonal (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and goat polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibody were commercially available. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (8–10-week-old, 200–250 g body weigh; Harlan, Madison, WI) were used for the isolation of rat enterocytes and immunofluorescence localization studies. Pi dietary adaptation was performed in PDZK1−/− mice (26Lan D. Silver D.L. Fenofibrate induces a novel degradation pathway for scavenger receptor B-I independent of PDZK1.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23390-23396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), NHERF1−/− mice (24Shenolikar S. Voltz J.W. Minkoff C.M. Wade J.B. Weinman E.J. Targeted disruption of the mouse NHERF-1 gene promotes internalization of proximal tubule sodium-phosphate cotransporter type IIa and renal phosphate wasting.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11470-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), and age- and sex-matched wild type control mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). The animals were maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and normal drinking water was supplied ad libitum. The mice were acclimated on regular chow diet and then fed ad libitum a high Pi (1.5% Pi, diet TD.08499) or a low Pi (0.1% Pi, diet TD.85010) diet (Harlan Teklad) for 7 days. The diets were otherwise matched for their calcium (0.6%), magnesium, sodium, protein, fat, and vitamin D content. A total of 24 mice for each experimental group were studied. The animal study protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Colorado-Denver. Enterocytes were isolated from the duodenum of rats. Briefly, rats were euthanized (70 mg/kg of pentobarbital). The small intestine was excised and flushed with PBS. The initial 10 cm of small intestine was separated and cut along its length to expose the lumen. This segment was placed in 10 ml of Enterocyte Isolation Buffer (Dulbecco PBS, 15 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm N-acetylcysteine), rotated vigorously at 37 °C for 15 min, vortexed for 15 s, the suspension poured through cheesecloth, the resultant suspension was placed on ice and the process was repeated. The isolated enterocytes were then washed twice in PBS. Isolated rat enterocytes were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with HALT protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL), and solubilized at 25 °C for 40 min. A total cell lysate sample was removed and the insoluble material was pelleted at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was pre-cleared with Ultralink Immobilized Protein A/G Plus beads (Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C. 10 μg of either NaPi-2b rabbit polyclonal antibody, NHERF1 mouse monoclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), or goat polyclonal PDZK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was bound with 150-μl Ultralink Protein A/G beads for 1 h at room temperature. Beads bound with antibody were rinsed with RIPA buffer and incubated with pre-cleared supernatant overnight at 4 °C. Pre-clear and immunoprecipitation beads were washed 3 times with RIPA buffer and eluted with 5× PAGE solution (5% SDS, 25% sucrose, 50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8). Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed via Western blot analysis. HEK-293 cells were co-transfected with FLAG-NHERF1 and either full-length or truncated GFP-NaPi-2b. In truncated GFP-NaPi-2b (GFP-NaPi-2b-4aa), the last four amino acids were deleted using site-directed mutagenesis as directed by the manufacturer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The primers used to create the mutant were: forward, AGGCCCTGTCCAACTAGGGGCACCTAGG; reverse, CCTAGGTGCCCCTAGTTGGACAGGGCCT. HEK-293 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine at 37 °C with 5% CO2. At ∼80% confluence, cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 as directed by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). After 48 h of co-expression, cells were harvested in FLAG lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4; HALT protease inhibitors (Thermo Scientific)). Insoluble material was pelleted at 12,000 × g for 10 min. After washing in FLAG lysis buffer, FLAG-tagged agarose beads (Sigma) were added to the resulting supernatant and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were rinsed 3 times with FLAG lysis buffer and eluted with 5× PAGE solution (5% SDS, 25% sucrose, 50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8). Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed via Western blot analysis. Ileum brush-border membrane vesicles were isolated by a double Mg2+ precipitation technique as described before (12Giral H. Caldas Y. Sutherland E. Wilson P. Breusegem S. Barry N. Blaine J. Jiang T. Wang X.X. Levi M. Regulation of rat intestinal sodium-dependent phosphate transporters by dietary phosphate.Am. J. Physiol.

Ileal mucosal scrapes (corresponding to the distal 15 cm of the small intestine) from two mice were combined in 15 ml of isolation buffer consisting of 50 mm mannitol, 2 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.1, and Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics). Ileal mucosa samples were homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. Brush-border membrane vesicles were prepared by a double serial Mg2+ precipitation procedure. First, MgCl2 was added to the homogenates (13 mm final concentration), incubated on ice for 20 min, and centrifuged at 3,000 × g. The supernatant was centrifuged at 38,000 × g at 4 °C for 40 min. The second Mg2+ precipitation step was performed by resuspending the membrane pellet in 7.5 ml of solution B (300 mm mannitol, 0.1 mm MgSO4, 20 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.1, and Complete protease inhibitor) with a 20-gauge needle. The samples were centrifuged at 6,000 × g and the supernatant was transferred to a clean tube. Final centrifugation at 38,000 × g at 4 °C for 40 min resulted in a pellet containing an ileal brush-border membrane vesicle that was resuspended in final buffer (300 mm mannitol, 16 mm HEPES/Tris, pH 7.5, and Complete protease inhibitor) by passing through a 25-gauge needle. Ileal brush-border membrane vesicle samples or proteins from rat immunoprecipitation were separated in 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST; 80 mm Na2HPO4, 25 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5) before incubation with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibodies used included: rabbit polyclonal against NaPi-2b (Davids Biotechnologie, Germany), rabbit polyclonal antibody against NHERF1 (EBP50) (Abcam), polyclonal against PDZK1, rabbit polyclonal antibody against Galectin-4 (Invitrogen), rabbit polyclonal antibody against SGLT1 (Alpha Diagnostics, San Antonio, TX), and mouse monoclonal against β-actin (Sigma). The membranes were incubated with HRP-linked secondary antibodies for 1 h followed for several washes with PBST. The membranes were incubated with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific). Images were acquired and analyzed by densitometry using a Biospectrum 500 imaging system (UVP). The CACO2BBE clone was kindly provided by Mark Mooseker (28Peterson M.D. Mooseker M.S. Characterization of the enterocyte-like brush border cytoskeleton of the C2BBe clones of the human intestinal cell line, Caco-2.J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 581-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CACO2BBE cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine at 37 °C and 5% CO2 incubator. Transfections were achieved with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and cells at 90% confluence, following the manufacturer's instructions. CACO2BBE cells expressing the fluorescent fusion proteins were grown on collagen-coated eight-well Lab-Tek chambered coverglass (Nunc). Measurements were performed 24–48 h after transfection. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) measurement of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope (Jena, Germany) equipped with a FLIMBox, a digital frequency-domain setup capable of multiharmonic analysis (29Colyer R.A. Lee C. Gratton E. A novel fluorescence lifetime imaging system that optimizes photon efficiency.Microsc. Res. Tech. 2008; 71: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The setup and imaging procedure has been extensively detailed before (23Giral H. Lanzano L. Caldas Y. Blaine J. Verlander J.W. Lei T. Gratton E. Levi M. Role of PDZK1 protein in apical membrane expression of renal sodium-coupled phosphate transporters.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 15032-15042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, images of the cell apical membrane were obtained in the 256 × 256 format with a pixel dwell time of 25.6 μs/pixel and averaging over 20 frames. SimFCS software was used for the acquisition and analysis of FLIM images following the phasor analysis (23Giral H. Lanzano L. Caldas Y. Blaine J. Verlander J.W. Lei T. Gratton E. Levi M. Role of PDZK1 protein in apical membrane expression of renal sodium-coupled phosphate transporters.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 15032-15042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, we used our digital frequency-domain setup to measure the modulation and phase at each of the pixels of an image. The modulation and phase are used to determine, respectively, the radial and angular coordinate of the phasor in a polar plot (31Redford G.I. Clegg R.M. Polar plot representation for frequency-domain analysis of fluorescence lifetimes.J. Fluoresc. 2005; 15: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The phasor associated to each cell imaged with FLIM was determined as the average phasor of the pixels corresponding to the cell apical membrane. In each experiment we determined the phasors of the unquenched donor (Dunq) as the average phasor of cells transfected only with Cerulean (Cu)-NaPi-2b, the phasor of the donor-acceptor pair (D+A) as the average of cells transfected with Cu-NaPi-2b and EYFP-NHERF1 or EYFP-PDZK1, and phasor of the autofluorescence by imaging nontransfected cells. To quantify FRET results we analyzed the shift of the phasor of the donor in the presence of the acceptor with respect to the donor only. The trajectory of variable FRET efficiency is drawn in the plot starting from the donor only position (E = 0) to the autofluorescence phasor position (E = 1) (supplemental Fig. S1). Any phasor along this trajectory corresponds to a pure species of donor quenched (Dq) with FRET efficiency E. If the donors are not all paired with an acceptor, then a pixel may contain a mixture of quenched and unquenched donors with relative fractions fq and funq, respectively. In this case the phasor corresponding to donor plus acceptor (D+A) is a normalized linear combination of the phasors of Dq and Dunq and lies along the line connecting the two phasors. The fraction of interacting donors, fq, in a given mixture can be calculated from the distance of the phasor D+A from Dunq divided by the length of the entire segment (supplemental Fig. S1). In our experiments, the phasors of donor-acceptor cells (D+A) were described by a linear combination of quenched and unquenched donor species. The quenched donor (Dq) position has been extrapolated at the intersection between a linear fit of the data and the efficiency trajectory as described previously (23Giral H. Lanzano L. Caldas Y. Blaine J. Verlander J.W. Lei T. Gratton E. Levi M. Role of PDZK1 protein in apical membrane expression of renal sodium-coupled phosphate transporters.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 15032-15042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The position of Dq yields the value of efficiency E associated with the FRET interaction and represents the maximum FRET detectable if all the donors were ideally paired with an acceptor. To calculate the fraction of quenched donors, fq, associated to each phasor we considered the projection of the phasor on the linear fit and then divided its distance from Dunq by the length of the segment connecting Dq and Dunq. The modulation tracking images were obtained using a customized microscope at the Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics. The principle of the technique and methodology details has been already described in detail (32Lanzano L. Digman M.A. Fwu P. Giral H. Levi M. Gratton E. Nanometer-scale imaging by the modulation tracking method.J. Biophotonics. 2011; 4: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A Chameleon Ultra II laser (Coherent, CA) tuned at 930 nm was used for 2-photon excitation of enhanced green fluorescent protein or enhanced yellow fluorescent protein. A schematic of the modulation tracking imaging method is shown in supplemental Fig. S2. First a raster scan of the apical membrane is performed (supplemental Fig. S2A). Then we choose one isolated microvillus and point the scanner on its coordinates. We then start the tracking routine by scanning the laser spot in a circular orbit around the microvillus at any given section while scaning along its length to obtain a three-dimensional image of the surface in one or two channels (supplemental Fig. S2B). By modulation tracking, we obtain three-dimensional reconstructions of the microvilli surface (Fig. 4). The three-dimensional reconstruction is painted in color scale according to the fluorescence intensity recorded in one channel. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E.; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.005; and ***, p < 0.001. Data were analyzed for statistical significance by unpaired Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance. Many of the PDZ domain containing proteins that have documented within the apical membrane of epithelial cells are type I domains. This includes NHERF1 and PDZK1. Type I PDZ domains bind to the C-terminal tails of proteins with consensus sequences of -X-T/S-X-Φ (Φ = hydrophobic amino acid). Sequence analysis showed that NaPi-2b presents a well conserved PDZ-binding site at its C terminus end. The C-terminal sequence of NaPi-2b in both mice (accession NP_035532.2) and rats (accession NP_445832.1) is T-T-V-F. The C-terminal sequence of NaPi-2b in human (accession AAI46667.1) is C-T-A-L. Although there is divergence in the absolute sequence, the C-terminal sequence of NaPi-2b across species has retained its canonical PDZ binding motif. Consequently, the present studies were performed to test the hypothesis that PDZ domain containing proteins bind and regulate NaPi-2b. NHERF1 and PDZK1 have an established history of regulating key transport proteins within the apical membrane of a variety of epithelial cell types, including enterocytes (17Sugiura T. Shimizu T.

Currently, there are major gaps in our understanding of the molecular interactions between S. homoeocarpa and creeping bentgrass. In this study, 454 sequencing technology was used in the de novo assembly of S. homoeocarpa and creeping bentgrass transcriptomes. Transcript sequence data obtained using Illumina's first generation sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) were mapped to the transcriptome assemblies to estimate transcript representation in different SBS libraries. SBS libraries included a S. homoeocarpa culture control, a creeping bentgrass uninoculated control, and a library for creeping bentgrass inoculated with S. homoeocarpa and incubated for 96 h. A Fisher's exact test was performed to determine transcripts that were significantly different during creeping bentgrass infection with S. homoeocarpa. Fungal transcripts of interest included glycosyl hydrolases, proteases, and ABC transporters. Of particular interest were the large number of glycosyl hydrolase transcripts that target a wide range of plant cell wall compounds, corroborating the suggested wide host range and saprophytic abilities of S. homoeocarpa. Several of the multidrug resistance ABC transporters may be important for resistance to both fungicides and plant defense compounds. Creeping bentgrass transcripts of interest included germins, ubiquitin transcripts involved in proteasome degradation, and cinnamoyl reductase, which is involved in lignin production. This analysis provides an extensive overview of the S. homoeocarpa-turfgrass pathosystem and provides a starting point for the characterization of potential virulence factors and host defense responses. In particular, determination of important host defense responses may assist in the development of highly resistant creeping bentgrass varieties."
https://openalex.org/W2071133381,"The terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain, cytochrome c oxidase, consists of a hydrophobic reaction center formed by three mitochondrially encoded subunits with which 9-10 nuclear encoded subunits are associated. The three core subunits are synthesized on mitochondrial ribosomes and inserted into the inner membrane in a co-translational reaction facilitated by the Oxa1 insertase. Oxa1 consists of an N-terminal insertase domain and a C-terminal ribosome-binding region. Mutants lacking the C-terminal region show specific defects in co-translational insertion, suggesting that the close contact of the ribosome with the insertase promotes co-translational insertion of nascent chains. In this study, we inserted flexible linkers of 100 or 200 amino acid residues between the insertase domain and ribosome-binding region of Oxa1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the absence of the ribosome receptor Mba1, these linkers caused a length-dependent decrease in mitochondrial respiratory activity caused by diminished levels of cytochrome c oxidase. Interestingly, considerable amounts of mitochondrial translation products were still integrated into the inner membrane in these linker mutants. However, they showed severe defects in later stages of the biogenesis process, presumably during assembly into functional complexes. Our observations suggest that the close proximity of Oxa1 to ribosomes is not only used to improve membrane insertion but is also critical for the productive assembly of the subunits of the cytochrome c oxidase. This points to a role for Oxa1 in the spatial coordination of the ribosome with assembly factors that are critical for enzyme biogenesis."

In the present study, we aimed to clarify whether HCII participates in the regulation of angiogenesis. Male heterozygous HCII-deficient (HCII+/−) mice and male littermate wild-type (HCII+/+) mice at the age of 12–16 weeks were subjected to unilateral hindlimb ligation surgery. Laser speckle blood flow analysis showed that blood flow recovery in response to hindlimb ischemia was delayed in HCII+/− mice compared with that in HCII+/+ mice. Capillary number, arteriole number, and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and liver kinase B1 (LKB1) phosphorylation in ischemic muscles were decreased in HCII+/− mice. Human purified HCII (h-HCII) administration almost restored blood flow recovery, capillary density, and arteriole number as well as phosphorylation levels of eNOS, AMPK, and LKB1 in ischemic muscles of HCII+/− mice. Although treatment with h-HCII increased phosphorylation levels of eNOS, AMPK, and LKB1 in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), the h-HCII-induced eNOS phosphorylation was abolished by compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, and by AMPK siRNA. In a similar fashion, tube formation, proliferation, and migration of HAECs were also promoted by h-HCII treatment and were abrogated by pretreatment with compound C. HCII potentiates the activation of vascular endothelial cells and the promotion of angiogenesis in response to hindlimb ischemia via an AMPK-eNOS signaling pathway.

Previous research demonstrates the willingness of individuals to harm others, but little is understood about how far people are willing to go in being spiteful (relative to how far they could have gone) or their consistency in spitefulness across repeated trials. Our experiment is the first to provide individuals with repeated opportunities to spitefully harm anonymous others when the decision entails zero cost to the spiter and cannot be observed as such by the object of spite. This method reveals that the majority of individuals exhibit consistent (non-)spitefulness over time and that the distribution of spitefulness is bipolar: when choosing whether to be spiteful, most individuals either avoid spite altogether or impose the maximum possible harm on their unwitting victims."
https://openalex.org/W1981455890,"Ecologists often use multiple observer transect surveys to census animal populations. In addition to animal counts, these surveys produce sequences of detections and non-detections for each observer. When combined with additional data (i.e. covariates such as distance from the transect line), these sequences provide the additional information to estimate absolute abundance when detectability on the transect line is less than one. Although existing analysis approaches for such data have proven extremely useful, they have some limitations. For instance, it is difficult to extrapolate from observed areas to unobserved areas unless a rigorous sampling design is adhered to; it is also difficult to share information across spatial and temporal domains or to accommodate habitat-abundance relationships. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical modeling framework for multiple observer line transects that removes these limitations. In particular, abundance intensities can be modeled as a function of habitat covariates, making it easier to extrapolate to unsampled areas. Our approach relies on a complete data representation of the state space, where unobserved animals and their covariates are modeled using a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Observer detections are modeled via a bivariate normal distribution on the probit scale, with dependence induced by a distance-dependent correlation parameter. We illustrate performance of our approach with simulated data and on a known population of golf tees. In both cases, we show that our hierarchical modeling approach yields accurate inference about abundance and related parameters. In addition, we obtain accurate inference about population-level covariates (e.g. group size). We recommend that ecologists consider using hierarchical models when analyzing multiple-observer transect data, especially when it is difficult to rigorously follow pre-specified sampling designs. We provide a new R package, hierarchicalDS, to facilitate the building and fitting of these models."

Here we present a new structure-based methodology that applies robust computational tools to model peptide-HLA (p-HLA) binding interactions. The method leverages the structural conservation observed in p-HLA complexes to significantly reduce the search space and calculate the system’s binding free energy. This approach is benchmarked against existing p-HLA complexes and the prediction performance is measured against a library of experimentally validated peptides. The effect on binding activity across a large set of high-affinity peptides is used to investigate amino acid mismatches reported as high-risk factors in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
https://openalex.org/W2074733931,"Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX-1) is a transcription factor that regulates insulin expression and islet maintenance in the adult pancreas. Our recent studies demonstrate that PDX-1 is an oncogene for pancreatic cancer and is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that PDX-1 is a therapeutic target for both hormonal symptoms and tumor volume in mouse models of pancreatic cancer, insulinoma and islet neoplasia. Immunohistochemistry of human pancreatic and islet neoplasia specimens revealed marked PDX-1 overexpression, suggesting PDX-1 as a ""drugable"" target within these diseases. To do so, a novel RNA interference effector platform, bifunctional shRNA(PDX-1), was developed and studied in mouse and human cell lines as well as in mouse models of pancreatic cancer, insulinoma and islet neoplasia. Systemic delivery of bi-shRNA(humanPDX-1) lipoplexes resulted in marked reduction of tumor volume and improved survival in a human pancreatic cancer xenograft mouse model. bi-shRNA(mousePDX-1) lipoplexes prevented death from hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia in an insulinoma mouse model. shRNA(mousePDX-1) lipoplexes reversed hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia in an immune-competent mouse model of islet neoplasia. PDX-1 was overexpressed in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and nesidioblastosis. These data demonstrate that PDX-1 RNAi therapy controls hormonal symptoms and tumor volume in mouse models of pancreatic cancer, insulinoma and islet neoplasia, therefore, PDX-1 is a potential therapeutic target for these pancreatic diseases."

A number of Gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus subtilis produce a class of bacteriocins called “lantibiotics” (1Schnell N. Entian K.D. Schneider U. Götz F. Zähner H. Kellner R. Jung G.

Lantibiotics are small peptide antibiotics containing characteristic lanthionine and methyllanthionine bridges (Fig. 1A). The biosynthesis of lantibiotics starts with ribosomally synthesized prepeptides. The lanthionine and methyllanthionine bridges are introduced post-translationally by dehydration of serine and threonine residues followed by cyclization reactions with cysteine residues mediated by a membrane-bound multimeric protein complex, which consists of a dehydratase, LanB, and a cyclase, LanC (4Chatterjee C.

As shown for nisin, pore formation occurs when the lipid II-bound C terminus of the lantibiotic inserts into the membrane and the lipid II-nisin complex oligomerizes forming a pore consisting of eight lantibiotic and four lipid II molecules (21Breukink E. van Heusden H.E.

Although the relevant players have been identified, no structure of any of the proteins involved in lantibiotic immunity has been solved. Subtilin producing B. subtilis and nisin producing Lactococcus lactis strains, for example, possess four immunity genes as an integral part of the subtilin and nisin biosynthetic gene clusters (25Kuipers O.P.

Microbiol. 1994; 60: 814-825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of B. subtilis, these four genes encode SpaI as well as the three subunits of the ABC transporter SpaFEG (28Stein T. Heinzmann S. Düsterhus S. Borchert S. Entian K.D. Expression and functional analysis of the subtilin immunity genes spaIFEG in the subtilin-sensitive host Bacillus subtilis MO1099.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 822-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The N-terminal leader sequence of the lipoprotein SpaI marks this protein for extracellular export. After transport across the cytoplasmic membrane SpaI is anchored in the membrane via a diacylglyceryl moiety covalently attached to a cysteine residue of its own lipobox motif (Fig. 1B) (29Halami P.M. Stein T. Chandrashekar A. Entian K.D. Maturation and processing of SpaI, the lipoprotein involved in subtilin immunity in Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633.Microbiol. Res. 2010; 165: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the expression of SpaI alone is sufficient to confer subtilin immunity to B. subtilis. The expression of SpaFEG leads to a higher level of immunity than expression of SpaI alone. However, the strongest subtilin immunity is observed upon simultaneous expression of all four genes (28Stein T. Heinzmann S. Düsterhus S. Borchert S. Entian K.D. Expression and functional analysis of the subtilin immunity genes spaIFEG in the subtilin-sensitive host Bacillus subtilis MO1099.J.

Another well described example of proteins involved in lantibiotic immunity are the L. lactis proteins NisI, the equivalent to SpaI, and the ABC transporter NisFEG, which confer resistance to the lantibiotic nisin (27Engelke G.

Quantitative in vitro peptide release suggested that SpaFEG as well as NisFEG actively expel subtilin and nisin, respectively, into the surrounding medium. Thus, less subtilin or nisin was found in the membrane fraction when the transporter SpaFEG or NisFEG was expressed compared with the expression of the LanI protein alone (28Stein T. Heinzmann S. Düsterhus S. Borchert S. Entian K.D. Expression and functional analysis of the subtilin immunity genes spaIFEG in the subtilin-sensitive host Bacillus subtilis MO1099.J.

However, a direct interaction with the lantibiotic appears likely. An interaction between lipid-free NisI and nisin with an affinity in the micromolar range has been demonstrated (33Takala T.M. Koponen O. Qiao M. Saris P.E. Lipid-free NisI. Interaction with nisin and contribution to nisin immunity via secretion.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2004; 237: 171-177Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, hexahistidine-mediated cross-linking of His6-tagged SpaI with subtilin indicated a direct interaction between SpaI and subtilin but not between SpaI and nisin in agreement with a high specificity of the involved LanI proteins (28Stein T.

This is interesting, because subtilin and nisin not only share a very similar overall structure but also a sequence homology of more than 60% (34Entian K.D. de Vos W.M.

Lantibiotics. Peptides of diverse structure and function.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 61: 477-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). However, the observed absence of SpaI and NisI mediated cross-immunity is in line with the very weak sequence homology (23Draper L.A. Ross R.P. Hill C. Cotter P.D. Lantibiotic immunity.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2008; 9: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) of these two LanI proteins and their very different molecular sizes. Currently, four mechanisms for SpaI-mediated immunity can be discussed: (a) binding and sequestering of subtilin and thereby protecting the membrane from subtilin insertion, (b) preventing subtilin oligomerization prior to pore formation, (c) preventing the formation of the subtilin-lipid II complex prior to pore formation, or (d) acting as substrate-binding protein for the ABC transporter SpaFEG. SpaI as well as other LanI proteins do not show any sequence homology to proteins of known function or structure. Thus, an understanding of the immunity mechanism for the nisin group lantibiotics in general and the specificity and mode of action of the immunity protein SpaI in particular will benefit from structural insights at the molecular level. To this end, we present here the solution NMR structure of the first LanI protein, SpaI, which represents a novel three-dimensional fold. In vivo studies and NMR titration experiments with liposomes reveal determinants for the membrane interaction of SpaI and indicate a functional importance for this interaction. Our results are the first step on the way to understand subtilin immunity of B. subtilis on a structural level at atomic resolution. The coding sequences for all SpaI NMR constructs (SpaI3–143, SpaI18–143, SpaI28–143) were inserted into a modified pQE9 vector containing an N-terminal His6 tag followed by a TEV cleavage site. After TEV cleavage the expressed proteins contained two artificial residues at the N terminus, Gly and Ser for SpaI18–143 and SpaI28–143 and Gly and Arg for SpaI3–143 (the numbering scheme is referring to the wild type SpaI sequence, starting at the lipidated cysteine (Fig. 1B and supplemental Table S1). Expression and purification of all isotopically labeled SpaI constructs for NMR experiments was essentially done as described previously (36Christ N.A. Duchardt-Ferner E. Düsterhus S. Kötter P.

In brief, expression of isotopically labeled SpaI was carried out using standard methods overnight at 37 °C after induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The His-tagged SpaI was first purified over a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare). After overnight TEV cleavage the His tag and protease were removed via an anion exchange column and SpaI was further purified via gel filtration. Selectively labeled [15N]lysine (250 mg/liter), [13C]threonine (230 mg/liter) SpaI3–143 was produced as described before (36Christ N.A. Duchardt-Ferner E. Düsterhus S. Kötter P. Entian K.D.

https://openalex.org/W1973151557,"Methylation at C-5 (5-mdC) of CpG base pairs, the most abundant epigenetic modification of DNA, is catalyzed by 3 essential DNA methyltransferases (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b). Aberrations in DNA methylation and Dnmts are linked to different diseases including cancer. However, their role in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) has not been elucidated.Dnmt1 wild type (Dnmt1(+/+)) and hypomorphic (Dnmt1(N/+)) male mice that express reduced level of Dnmt1 were fed Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet containing ethanol for 6 weeks. Control mice were pair-fed calorie-matched alcohol-free liquid diet, and Dnmtase activity, 5-mdC content, gene expression profile and liver histopathology were evaluated. Ethanol feeding caused pronounced decrease in hepatic Dnmtase activity in Dnmt1(+/+) mice due to decrease in Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b protein levels and upregulation of miR-148 and miR-152 that target both Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b. Microarray and qPCR analysis showed that the genes involved in lipid, xenobiotic and glutathione metabolism, mitochondrial function and cell proliferation were dysregulated in the wild type mice fed alcohol. Surprisingly, Dnmt1(N/+) mice were less susceptible to alcoholic steatosis compared to Dnmt1(+/+) mice. Expression of several key genes involved in alcohol (Aldh3b1), lipid (Ppara, Lepr, Vldlr, Agpat9) and xenobiotic (Cyp39a1) metabolism, and oxidative stress (Mt-1, Fmo3) were significantly (P<0.05) altered in Dnmt1(N/+) mice relative to the wild type mice fed alcohol diet. However, CpG islands encompassing the promoter regions of Agpat9, Lepr, Mt1 and Ppara were methylation-free in both genotypes irrespective of the diet, suggesting that promoter methylation does not regulate their expression. Similarly, 5-mdC content of the liver genome, as measured by LC-MS/MS analysis, was not affected by alcohol diet in the wild type or hypomorphic mice.Although feeding alcohol diet reduced Dnmtase activity, the loss of one copy of Dnmt1 protected mice from alcoholic hepatosteatosis by dysregulating genes involved in lipid metabolism and oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2073826778,"Background Although it is known that RNA interference (RNAi) targeting viral genes protects experimental animals, such as mice, from the challenge of Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), it has not been previously investigated whether shRNAs targeting FMDV in transgenic dairy cattle or primary transgenic bovine epithelium cells will confer resistance against FMDV challenge. Principal Finding Here we constructed three recombinant lentiviral vectors containing shRNA against VP2 (RNAi-VP2), VP3 (RNAi-VP3), or VP4 (RNAi-VP4) of FMDV, and found that all of them strongly suppressed the transient expression of a FLAG-tagged viral gene fusion protein in 293T cells. In BHK-21 cells, RNAi-VP4 was found to be more potent in inhibition of viral replication than the others with over 98% inhibition of viral replication. Therefore, recombinant lentiviral vector RNAi-VP4 was transfected into bovine fetal fibroblast cells to generate transgenic nuclear donor cells. With subsequent somatic cell cloning, we generated forty transgenic blastocysts, and then transferred them to 20 synchronized recipient cows. Three transgenic bovine fetuses were obtained after pregnant period of 4 months, and integration into chromosome in cloned fetuses was confirmed by Southern hybridization. The primary tongue epithelium cells of transgenic fetuses were isolated and inoculated with 100 TCID50 of FMDV, and it was observed that shRNA significantly suppressed viral RNA synthesis and inhibited over 91% of viral replication after inoculation of FMDV for 48 h. Conclusion RNAi-VP4 targeting viral VP4 gene appears to prevent primary epithelium cells of transgenic bovine fetus from FMDV infection, and it could be a candidate shRNA used for cultivation of transgenic cattle against FMDV."
https://openalex.org/W2018172131,"Grade IV astrocytoma or glioblastoma has a poor clinical outcome that can be linked to hypoxia, invasiveness and active vascular remodeling. It has recently been suggested that hypoxia-inducible factors, Hifs, increase glioma growth and aggressiveness [1], [2], [3]. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Egl 9 homolog 3 (Egln3), a prolyl-hydroxylase that promotes Hif degradation, suppresses tumor progression of human and rodent glioma models. Through intracranial tumorigenesis and in vitro assays, we demonstrate for the first time that Egln3 was sufficient to decrease the kinetics of tumor progression and increase survival. We also find that Klf5, a transcription factor important to vascular remodeling, was regulated by hypoxia in glioma. An analysis of the tumor vasculature revealed that elevated Egln3 normalized glioma capillary architecture, consistent with a role for Egln3 in eliciting decreases in the production of Hif-regulated, angiogenic factors. We also find that the hydroxylase-deficient mutant, Egln3H196A partially maintained tumor suppressive activity. These results highlight a bifurcation of Egln3 signaling and suggest that Egln3 has a non-hydroxylase-dependent function in glioma. We conclude that Egln3 is a critical determinant of glioma formation and tumor vascular functionality."
https://openalex.org/W2046388248,"Background Marine lineage diversification is shaped by the interaction of biotic and abiotic factors but our understanding of their relative roles is underdeveloped. The megadiverse bivalve superfamily Galeommatoidea represents a promising study system to address this issue. It is composed of small-bodied clams that are either free-living or have commensal associations with invertebrate hosts. To test if the evolution of this lifestyle dichotomy is correlated with specific ecologies, we have performed a statistical analysis on the lifestyle and habitat preference of 121 species based on 90 source documents. Methodology/Principal Findings Galeommatoidea has significant diversity in the two primary benthic habitats: hard- and soft-bottoms. Hard-bottom dwellers are overwhelmingly free-living, typically hidden within crevices of rocks/coral heads/encrusting epifauna. In contrast, species in soft-bottom habitats are almost exclusively infaunal commensals. These infaunal biotic associations may involve direct attachment to a host, or clustering around its tube/burrow, but all commensals locate within the oxygenated sediment envelope produced by the host’s bioturbation. Conclusions/Significance The formation of commensal associations by galeommatoidean clams is robustly correlated with an abiotic environmental setting: living in sediments (). Sediment-dwelling bivalves are exposed to intense predation pressure that drops markedly with depth of burial. Commensal galeommatoideans routinely attain depth refuges many times their body lengths, independent of siphonal investment, by virtue of their host’s burrowing and bioturbation. In effect, they use their much larger hosts as giant auto-irrigating siphon substitutes. The evolution of biotic associations with infaunal bioturbating hosts may have been a prerequisite for the diversification of Galeommatoidea in sediments and has likely been a key factor in the success of this exceptionally diverse bivalve superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W1974575322,"Oral administration of sodium tungstate has shown hyperglycemia-reducing activity in several animal models of diabetes. We present new insights into the mechanism of action of tungstate.We studied protein expression and phosphorylation in the liver of STZ rats, a type I diabetes model, treated with sodium tungstate in the drinking water (2 mg/ml) and in primary cultured-hepatocytes, through Western blot and Real Time PCR analysis.Tungstate treatment reduces the expression of gluconeogenic enzymes (PEPCK, G6Pase, and FBPase) and also regulates transcription factors accountable for the control of hepatic metabolism (c-jun, c-fos and PGC1α). Moreover, ERK, p90rsk and GSK3, upstream kinases regulating the expression of c-jun and c-fos, are phosphorylated in response to tungstate. Interestingly, PKB/Akt phosphorylation is not altered by the treatment. Several of these observations were reproduced in isolated rat hepatocytes cultured in the absence of insulin, thereby indicating that those effects of tungstate are insulin-independent.Here we show that treatment with tungstate restores the phosphorylation state of various signaling proteins and changes the expression pattern of metabolic enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1999966753,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system is the major pathway for selective protein degradation in eukaryotes. Despite extensive study of this system, the mechanisms by which proteasome function and cell growth are coordinated remain unclear. Here, we identify Spg5 as a novel component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Spg5 binds the regulatory particle of the proteasome and the base subassembly in particular, but it is excluded from mature proteasomes. The SPG5 gene is strongly induced in the stationary phase of budding yeast, and spg5Δ mutants show a progressive loss of viability under these conditions. Accordingly, during logarithmic growth, Spg5 appears largely dispensable for proteasome function, but during stationary phase the proteasomes of spg5Δ mutants show both structural and functional defects. This loss of proteasome function is reflected in the accumulation of oxidized proteins preferentially in stationary phase in spg5Δ mutants. Thus, Spg5 is a positive regulator of the proteasome that is critical for survival of cells that have ceased to proliferate due to nutrient limitation."
https://openalex.org/W2044333090,"Glandular secreting trichomes (GSTs) are called biofactories because they are active in synthesizing, storing and secreting various types of plant secondary metabolites. As the most effective drug against malaria, artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone is derived from GSTs of Artemisia annua. However, low artemisinin content (0.001%~1.54% of dry weight) has hindered its wide application. We investigate the GST-expressed proteins in Artemisia annua using a comparative proteomics approach, aiming for a better understanding of the trichome proteome and arteminisin metabolism. 2D-electrophoresis was employed to compare the protein profiles of GSTs and leaves. More than 700 spots were resolved for GSTs, of which ∼93 non-redundant proteins were confidently identified by searching NCBI and Artemisia EST databases. Over 70% of these proteins were highly expressed in GTSs. Functional classification of these GSTs enriched proteins revealed that many of them participate in major plant metabolic processes such as electron transport, transcription and translation."
https://openalex.org/W2020384487,"Visual short-term memory (VSTM) is limited in the quantity and quality of items that can be retained over time. Importantly, these two mnemonic parameters interact: increasing the number of items in VSTM reduces the quality with which they are represented. Here, we ask whether this trade-off is under top-down control. Specifically, we test whether participants can strategically optimise the trade-off between quality and quantity for VSTM according to task demands. We manipulated strategic trade-off by varying expectations about the number of to-be-remembered items (Experiments 1-2) or the precision required for the memory-based judgement (Experiment 3). In a final experiment, we manipulated both variables in a complementary way to maximise the motivation to strategically control the balance between number and the quality of items encoded into VSTM. In different blocks, performance would benefit most either by encoding a large number of items with low precision or by encoding a small number of items with high precision (Experiment 4). In all experiments, we compared VSTM performance on trials matched for mnemonic demand, but within contexts emphasising the quality or quantity of VSTM representations. Across all four experiments, we found no evidence to suggest that participants use this contextual information to bias the balance between the number and precision of items in VSTM. Rather, our data suggest that the trade-off may be determined primarily by stimulus-driven factors at encoding."
https://openalex.org/W2042212741,"Background Normal reading requires eye guidance and activation of lexical representations so that words in text can be identified accurately. However, little is known about how the visual content of text supports eye guidance and lexical activation, and thereby enables normal reading to take place. Methods and Findings To investigate this issue, we investigated eye movement performance when reading sentences displayed as normal and when the spatial frequency content of text was filtered to contain just one of 5 types of visual content: very coarse, coarse, medium, fine, and very fine. The effect of each type of visual content specifically on lexical activation was assessed using a target word of either high or low lexical frequency embedded in each sentence Results No type of visual content produced normal eye movement performance but eye movement performance was closest to normal for medium and fine visual content. However, effects of lexical frequency emerged early in the eye movement record for coarse, medium, fine, and very fine visual content, and were observed in total reading times for target words for all types of visual content. Conclusion These findings suggest that while the orchestration of multiple scales of visual content is required for normal eye-guidance during reading, a broad range of visual content can activate processes of word identification independently. Implications for understanding the role of visual content in reading are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2084413834,"While a single approaching object is known to attract spatial attention, it is unknown how attention is directed when the background looms towards the observer as s/he moves forward in a quasi-stationary environment. In Experiment 1, we used a cued speeded discrimination task to quantify where and how spatial attention is directed towards the target superimposed onto a cloud of moving dots. We found that when the motion was expansive, attention was attracted towards the singular point of the optic flow (the focus of expansion, FOE) in a sustained fashion. The effects were less pronounced when the motion was contractive. The more ecologically valid the motion features became (e.g., temporal expansion of each dot, spatial depth structure implied by distribution of the size of the dots), the stronger the attentional effects. Further, the attentional effects were sustained over 1000 ms. Experiment 2 quantified these attentional effects using a change detection paradigm by zooming into or out of photographs of natural scenes. Spatial attention was attracted in a sustained manner such that change detection was facilitated or delayed depending on the location of the FOE only when the motion was expansive. Our results suggest that focal attention is strongly attracted towards singular points that signal the direction of forward ego-motion."
https://openalex.org/W2038860421,"We have previously reported a world-first phase I clinical trial to treat HCV patients using monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DC) loaded with HCV-specific lipopeptides. While the brief treatment proved to be safe, it failed to reduce the viral load and induced only transient cell-mediated immune responses, measured by IFNγ ELIspot. Here we reanalysed the PBMC samples from this trial to further elucidate the immunological events associated with the Mo-DC therapy. We found that HCV-specific single- and multi-cytokine secreting T cells were induced by the Mo-DC immunotherapy in some patients, although at irregular intervals and not consistently directed to the same HCV antigen. Despite the vaccination, the responses were generally poor in quality and comprised of primarily single-cytokine secreting cells. The frequency of FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) fluctuated following DC infusion and eventually dropped to below baseline by week 12, an interesting trend suggesting that the vaccination may have resulted in a more subtle outcome than was initially apparent. Our data suggested that Mo-DC therapy induced complex immune responses in vivo that may or may not lead to clinical benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2063067037,"As scientists we like to think that modern societies and their members base their views, opinions and behaviour on scientific facts. This is not necessarily the case, even though we are all (over-) exposed to information flow through various channels of media, i.e. newspapers, television, radio, internet, and web. It is thought that this is mainly due to the conflicting information on the mass media and to the individual attitude (formed by cultural, educational and environmental factors), that is, one external factor and another personal factor. In this paper we will investigate the dynamical development of opinion in a small population of agents by means of a computational model of opinion formation in a co-evolving network of socially linked agents. The personal and external factors are taken into account by assigning an individual attitude parameter to each agent, and by subjecting all to an external but homogeneous field to simulate the effect of the media. We then adjust the field strength in the model by using actual data on scientific perception surveys carried out in two different populations, which allow us to compare two different societies. We interpret the model findings with the aid of simple mean field calculations. Our results suggest that scientifically sound concepts are more difficult to acquire than concepts not validated by science, since opposing individuals organize themselves in close communities that prevent opinion consensus."
https://openalex.org/W2072563587,"Mature oocytes can be parthenogenetically activated by a variety of methods and the resulting embryos are valuable for studies of the respective roles of paternal and maternal genomes in early mammalian development. In the present study, we report the first successful development of parthenogenetic canine embryos to the post-implantation stage. Nine out of ten embryo transfer recipients became pregnant and successful in utero development of canine parthenotes was confirmed. For further evaluation of these parthenotes, their fetal development was compared with artificially inseminated controls and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were compared using ACP RT-PCR, histological analysis and immunohistochemistry. We found formation of the limb-bud and no obvious differences in histological appearance of the canine parthenote recovered before degeneration occurred; however canine parthenotes were developmentally delayed with different cell cycle regulating-, mitochondria-related and apoptosis-related gene expression patterns compared with controls. In conclusion, our protocols were suitable for activating canine oocytes artificially and supported early fetal development. We demonstrated that the developmental abnormalities in canine parthenotes may result from defective regulation of apoptosis and aberrant gene expression patterns, and provided evidence that canine parthenotes can be a useful tool for screening and for comparative studies of imprinted genes."
https://openalex.org/W2091865347,"This paper proposes a set of web-based indicators for quantifying and ranking the relevance of terms related to key-issues in Ecology and Sustainability Science. Search engines that operate in different contexts (e.g. global, social, scientific) are considered as web information carriers (WICs) and are able to analyse; (i) relevance on different levels: global web, individual/personal sphere, on-line news, and culture/science; (ii) time trends of relevance; (iii) relevance of keywords for environmental governance. For the purposes of this study, several indicators and specific indices (relational indices and dynamic indices) were applied to a test-set of 24 keywords. Outputs consistently show that traditional study topics in environmental sciences such as water and air have remained the most quantitatively relevant keywords, while interest in systemic issues (i.e. ecosystem and landscape) has grown over the last 20 years. Nowadays, the relevance of new concepts such as resilience and ecosystem services is increasing, but the actual ability of these concepts to influence environmental governance needs to be further studied and understood. The proposed approach, which is based on intuitive and easily replicable procedures, can support the decision-making processes related to environmental governance."
https://openalex.org/W2108347290,"Phospholipase Cβ2 (PLC β2) is activated by G proteins and generates calcium signals in cells. PLCβ2 is absent in normal breast tissue, but is highly expressed in breast tumors where its expression is correlated with the progression and migration of the tumor. This pattern of expression parallels the expression of the breast cancer specific gene protein 1 which is also known as γ-synuclein. The cellular function of γ-synuclein and the role it plays in proliferation are unknown. Here, we determined whether γ-synuclein can interact with PLCβ2 and affect its activity. Using co-immunprecitation and co-immunofluorescence, we find that in both benign and aggressive breast cancer cell lines γ-synuclein and PLCβ2 are associated. In solution, purified γ-synuclein binds to PLCβ2 with high affinity as measured by fluorescence methods. Protease digestion and mass spectrometry studies show that γ-synuclein binds to a site on the C-terminus of PLCβ2 that overlaps with the Gαq binding site. Additionally, γ-synuclein competes for Gαq association, but not for activators that bind to the N-terminus (i.e. Rac1 and Gβγ). Binding of γ-synuclein reduces the catalytic activity of PLCβ2 by mechanism that involves inhibition of product release without affecting membrane interactions. Since activated Gαq binds more strongly to PLCβ2 than γ-synuclein, addition of Gαq(GTPγS) to the γ-synuclein –PLCβ2 complex allows for relief of enzyme inhibition along with concomitant activation. We also find that Gβγ can reverse γ-synuclein inhibition without dissociating the γ-synuclein- PLCβ2- complex. These studies point to a role of γ-synuclein in promoting a more robust G protein activation of PLCβ2."
https://openalex.org/W2094093327,"The exoloops of glycoprotein hormone receptors (GpHRs) transduce the signal generated by the ligand-ectodomain interactions to the transmembrane helices either through direct hormonal contact and/or by modulating the interdomain interactions between the hinge region (HinR) and the transmembrane domain (TMD). The ligand-induced conformational alterations in the HinRs and the interhelical loops of luteinizing hormone receptor/follicle stimulating hormone receptor/thyroid stimulating hormone receptor were mapped using exoloop-specific antibodies generated against a mini-TMD protein designed to mimic the native exoloop conformations that were created by joining the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor exoloops constrained through helical tethers and library-derived linkers. The antibody against the mini-TMD specifically recognized all three GpHRs and inhibited the basal and hormone-stimulated cAMP production without affecting hormone binding. Interestingly, binding of the antibody to all three receptors was abolished by prior incubation of the receptors with the respective hormones, suggesting that the exoloops are buried in the hormone-receptor complexes. The antibody also suppressed the high basal activities of gain-of-function mutations in the HinRs, exoloops, and TMDs such as those involved in precocious puberty and thyroid toxic adenomas. Using the antibody and point/deletion/chimeric receptor mutants, we demonstrate that changes in the HinR-exoloop interactions play an important role in receptor activation. Computational analysis suggests that the mini-TMD antibodies act by conformationally locking the transmembrane helices by means of restraining the exoloops and the juxta-membrane regions.

The specific binding of the respective ligands, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and LH/human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), to these receptors takes place at the large extracellular domains (ECD)-containing tandem repeats of nine or more leucine-rich repeats (LRR) flanked by the cysteine box (Cb) motifs (2Fan Q.R. Hendrickson W.A. Structure of human follicle-stimulating hormone in complex with its receptor.Nature. 2005; 433: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), and the signals thus generated are transmitted to the distally situated transmembrane domains (TMD), a process still not well understood. transmembrane helix human chorionic gonadotropin follicle stimulating hormone FSH receptor thyroid stimulating hormone TSH receptor luteinizing hormone LH receptor glycoprotein hormone receptor extracellular domain leucine-rich repeat extracellular loop intracellular Loops constitutively activating mutation cysteine box-2/3 normal rabbit IgG (pre-immune) molecular dynamics root mean square deviation nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid amino acid transmembrane domain hinge region relative mean fluorescence intensity relative accessibility relative surface expression. Various models have been proposed to explain the mechanism of signal transmission between these two distinct regions. A model for receptor activation, mainly derived directly from the crystal structure of FSH-FSHR ECD, suggests receptor activation occurs through direct interactions of the loops 1 and 3 of the common α-subunit of the hormones with the TMD and the extracellular loops (ECL) after the determinant loops of the β subunits of hormones make initial contacts with the LRRs (2Fan Q.R. Hendrickson W.A. Structure of human follicle-stimulating hormone in complex with its receptor.Nature. 2005; 433: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). This model of receptor activation has been challenged by Moyle et al. (3Moyle W.R. Campbell R.K. Rao S.N. Ayad N.G. Bernard M.P. Han Y. Wang Y. Model of human chorionic gonadotropin and lutropin receptor interaction that explains signal transduction of the glycoprotein hormones.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20020-20031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), who envisaged additional contacts between the ECD and ECLs to be critical for receptor activation. These multipoint interactions are thought to occur between the N-terminal ECD and the ECLs through the β-loop region of the LRR. On the contrary, it has also been reported that the C-terminal region of the ECD makes extensive contacts with the ECLs 1 and 2 and lies parallel to the concave surface of the LRR domain (4Moyle W.R. Xing Y. Lin W. Cao D. Myers R.V. Kerrigan J.E. Bernard M.P. Model of glycoprotein hormone receptor ligand binding and signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44442-44459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Difficulty in ascertaining the correct model stems from the unavailability of the structural information on the C-terminal region of the ECD called the hinge region (HinR). Initially thought to be a structural scaffold, HinR was assumed to act as a flexible hinge facilitating contacts between the hormone and the TMD (5Moyle W.R. Lin W. Myers R.V. Cao D. Kerrigan J.E. Bernard M.P. Models of glycoprotein hormone receptor interaction.Endocrine. 2005; 26: 189-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the recent mutation-based evidence (6Mueller S. Jaeschke H. Günther R. Paschke R. The hinge region: an important receptor component for GPHR function.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2010; 21: 111-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and our earlier studies on the agonistic antibodies against the FSHR HinR (7Agrawal G. Dighe R.R. Critical involvement of the hinge region of the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor in the activation of the receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 2636-2647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) suggest that the HinR may be involved in hormone-dependent as well as independent activation of the receptor. Moreover, the presence of activating mutations at the conserved motifs in the cysteine box-2/3 (Cb-2/3) of HinR and the combined effect of such mutations with those present in the exoloops have helped in development of an alternate model of receptor activation where the HinR acts as a “tethered inverse agonist” constraining the receptor in an inactive state which is reversed by hormone binding resulting in its activation (8Neumann S. Claus M. Paschke R. Interactions between the extracellular domain and the extracellular loops as well as the 6th transmembrane domain are necessary for TSH receptor activation.Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2005; 152: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A major difficulty in deriving a holistic view of the receptor activation process is the inability to demonstrate direct interactions between the hormone and the ECLs and/or HinR. Moreover, the models do not take into account unique attributes of each member of GpHR family such as the relatively higher basal cAMP production of TSHR compared with LHR or FSHR and the variations in interactions between each receptor component. Although the cooperativity between ECLs during receptor activation is well documented (9Kleinau G. Jaeschke H. Mueller S. Raaka B.M. Neumann S. Paschke R. Krause G. Evidence for cooperative signal triggering at the extracellular loops of the TSH receptor.FASEB J. 2008; 22: 2798-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), role of individual loops or change in their spatio-geometric arrangement during receptor activation is not clearly understood. Mutational studies provide only transitional information on these highly dynamic interactions. Antibodies are the ideal tools to monitor such activation-related conformational changes during ligand-receptor interaction. For example, the ability of ECL-specific antibodies of rhodopsin (10Hicks D. Barnstable C.J. Different rhodopsin monoclonal antibodies reveal different binding patterns on developing and adult rat retina.J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1987; 35: 1317-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and CCR5 receptors (11Blanpain C. Vanderwinden J.M. Cihak J. Wittamer V. Le Poul E. Issafras H. Stangassinger M. Vassart G. Marullo S. Schlndorff D. Multiple active states and oligomerization of CCR5 revealed by functional properties of monoclonal antibodies.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 723-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) to distinguish between the conformations of the loops in inactive and active states of the receptors highlights their suitability to study the ECLs of GpHRs. Unfortunately, there have not been many reports on antibodies against the exoloops of GpHRs that recognize the native conformations of the loops as they exist in the wild type receptor. Inherent difficulties in obtaining soluble TMDs for raising antibodies and loss of conformational information in the ECL peptide-specific antibodies are the primary causes of such lacunae. We have, therefore, used a novel approach of designing a recombinant mini-TMD protein where TSHR ECLs are computationally joined to intracellular loops (ICLs) through the library-derived linkers and helical tethers, thus preserving the natural spatio-geometric arrangement of the ECLs in the native TMD of the receptor. This approach circumvents the difficulties in generation of a soluble TMD while maintaining the relative arrangements of the ECLs with respect to each other. Binding and functional studies with antibodies against such a protein provide novel insights into the role of ECLs in GpHR activation. A bipartite strategy was employed to model TMDs, the first step being to model the individual helices and loops and then create a composite model by joining ECLs/ICLs with the modeled TMH. The scheme of the strategy used is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. A multitemplate approach was employed to model (using Modeler 9.07 (12Eswar N. Webb B. Marti-Renom M.A. Madhusudhan M. Eramian D. Shen M.Y. Pieper U. Sali A. Comparative protein structure modeling using MODELLER.Curr. Protoc. Protein Sci. 2007; (Chapter 2, Unit 2.9)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) the individual helices of TSHR TMD to incorporate structural features of G protein-coupled receptors that are distributed over different crystal structures and may not be represented by a single template (13Worth C.L. Kleinau G. Krause G. Comparative sequence and structural analyses of G-protein-coupled receptor crystal structures and implications for molecular models.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e7011Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The human β2-adrenergic receptor (PDB ID 2RH1) served as the optimum template for TMHs 2, 3, and 6 as it conforms to the absence of the glycine bend or disulfide bridge in the helix 2 the absence of a second disulfide bridge between TMH6 and ECL3 and an insertion in TMH3. The turkey β1 adrenergic receptor (PDB ID 2VT4) was the template of choice for TMH1 due to the absence of glycine-glycine or proline motifs, whereas the squid rhodopsin (PDB ID 2Z73) was used for modeling TMH4 and TMH7. Bovine rhodopsin (PDB ID 1U19), similar to TSHR, does not contain an intra ECL2 disulfide bridge with TMH5 and hence was used as a template for modeling the same. A regular helix extension was carried out for TMH2 and TMH5 in the absence of the characteristic structural bulges caused by consecutive threonines in TMH2 or proline in TMH5 of squid rhodopsin. Rotational and translational symmetry operations on the modeled TMH were carried out to simulate a membrane-bound G protein-coupled receptor by implicitly adding a 30 Å membrane and setting shift angles to 15° from −6° to +9° and rotation to −50°. The structural alignments of the modeled TMHs and their respective templates are shown in Fig. 1A. The ECLs and the ICLs were modeled by first searching the database of Loops In Membrane Proteins (LIMP) (14Hildebrand P.W. Goede A. Bauer R.A. Gruening B. Ismer J. Michalsky E. Preissner R. SuperLooper. A prediction server for the modeling of loops in globular and membrane proteins.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: W571-W574Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) for loops with sequences and gap tolerance similar to the beginning and ends of each TMH. These candidate loops were joined to the modeled TMH by a loop-closing algorithm implemented in cyclic coordinate descent (CCD) module of Rosetta 3.1 (15Canutescu A.A. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Cyclic coordinate descent. A robotics algorithm for protein loop closure.Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), and the loop conformations were optimized by systematic conformational sampling of the loop backbone followed by energy minimization (16Spassov V.Z. Flook P.K. Yan L. LOOPER. A molecular mechanics-based algorithm for protein loop prediction.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2008; 21: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Several TSHR-specific loop constraints were implemented during loop optimization. First, the β-sheet-like hairpin structure of ECL2 was maintained between the transmembrane helices based on the rhodopsin structure and those proposed in the case of the CCR5 chemokine receptor (17Lee B. Sharron M. Blanpain C. Doranz B.J. Vakili J. Setoh P. Berg E. Liu G. Guy H.R. Durell S.R. Parmentier M. Chang C.N. Price K. Tsang M. Doms R.W.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9617-9626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Second, the ICL3 conformations were adopted from the NMR structure of the rhodopsin cytosolic loop peptide complex (18Yeagle P.L. Alderfer J.L. Albert A.D. Three-dimensional structure of the cytoplasmic face of the G protein receptor rhodopsin.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9649-9654Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and last, the placement of ECLs 1 and 3 at TMH periphery was carried out according to the previously reported mutational data (9Kleinau G. Jaeschke H. Mueller S. Raaka B.M. Neumann S. Paschke R. Krause G. Evidence for cooperative signal triggering at the extracellular loops of the TSH receptor.FASEB J. 2008; 22: 2798-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on the composite model of TSHR TMH and ECLs/ICLs after being typed with implicit membrane solvation under the CHARMm27 force field (INSIGHTII 2000 (20Brooks B.R. Brooks 3rd, C.L. Mackerell Jr., A.D. Nilsson L. Petrella R.J. Roux B. Won Y. Archontis G. Bartels C. Boresch S. Caflisch A. Caves L. Cui Q. Dinner A.R. Feig M. Fischer S. Gao J. Hodoscek M. Im W.

The biomolecular simulation program.J. Comput. Chem. 2009; 30: 1545-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (5775) Google Scholar)). The solvent in each minimized system was equilibrated for 10 ps while gradually heating the model from 0 to 300 K in 25 ps followed by a second equilibrium phase of 25 ps under a constant pressure and finally subjected to a 1-ns isothermal, constant volume MD simulations. Additional restrain parameters such as a disulfide bridge patch between residues Cys-494 and Cys-569 were applied during MD simulations, and the distance restraints were imposed for maintenance of the α-helical regions in TMD. A similar procedure was also adopted for modeling the transmembrane domains of LHR. The mini-TMD protein was synthetically created by joining the ECLs to the ICLs by tethering them with the juxtamembrane elements adjacent to the membrane interface as shown in Fig. 1B. The ECL1 (Ser-479–Thr-490) was connected to ECL2 (Gly-559–Pro-577) using the ICL2 (Thr-524–Ile-533) as the linker. Ala-471–His-478, part of the TMH2, was used to tether the N terminus of the ECL1, whereas the first three residues of TMH 3 (Pro-492–Cys-494) were joined to the last two residues of TMH3 (Trp-520–Tyr-521) to connect the ECL1 to the ICL2. The ICL2 was in turn connected to the ECL2 by helix elements formed by the first five residues (Arg-534–Ala-538) and the last six residues (Ala-553–Val-558) of the TMH4. The ECL2 was similarly connected to the ECL3 (Asn-650–Ser-657) using the ICL3 (Val-608–Asp-617) as a linker where the helix segments in the TMH5 (Ala–579–Val-584) acted as the N-terminal tether, whereas Ala-647–Asn-650 in the TMH6 acted as the C-terminal tether. The helix element in the TMH 7 (Ser-659–Val-664) was used to stabilize the C-terminal end of the mini-TMD. The optimum length of the above-mentioned helical tethers used for joining ECLs to ICLs was determined by growing the helical chain by successive addition of N-terminal and C-terminal residues of the helical segment and concomitant prediction of the secondary structure conformation using iterative Tasser simulations (21Roy A. Kucukural A. Zhang Y. I-TASSER. A unified platform for automated protein structure and function prediction.Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 725-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4670) Google Scholar). The assembled sequence was modeled on the energy-minimized TSHR TMD structure to identify the regions of distorted geometry and potential steric clashes. Dihedral violations were observed at Ile-26 corresponding to the residue Ile-523 belonging to the C-terminal tether of ECL2. Helix discontinuity was also observed for Ala-522 and Thr-524 in the same region. An in silico mutagenic scan was undertaken for these two residues that would enable regular helix extension in this region, and based on these scans, both residues were replaced by threonine and alanine, respectively. The main chain bond angle violations were also observed for Leu-578 where an extended coil was noticed in place of the expected β-turn. This might arise due to the presence of proline (Pro-577) in the PLA motif, and a search of the precomputed secondary structure assignments for different crystal structures (22Heinig M. Frishman D. STRIDE. A web server for secondary structure assignment from known atomic coordinates of proteins.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W500-W502Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar) revealed that substituting Leu-578 with glycine may restore the correct secondary structure. The corrected mini-TMD protein sequence was reverse-translated to obtain the encoding DNA sequence which was codon-optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. The resultant sequence was synthetically assembled by a modified two-step multiplex PCR (23Rydzanicz R. Zhao X.S. Johnson P.E. Assembly PCR oligo maker. A tool for designing oligodeoxynucleotides for constructing long DNA molecules for RNA production.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W521-W525Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) where the multiple overlapping primers yielded an amplified mixture of annealing combinations. This mixture was subsequently used as the template for assembling the entire full-length gene by the primers specific for the 5′ and 3′ ends corresponding to the N-terminal and the C-terminal regions of the designed protein, respectively. The mini-TMD encoding sequence was cloned into pPROexHtA vector and expressed in E. coli as a His-tagged protein and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography under native conditions. Circular Dichroism (CD) spectra of the mini TMD were recorded between 195 and 250 nm using the Jasco J810 polarimeter at the protein concentration of 10 μm at 25 ºC in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with the scan setting set to 1 nm wavelength pitch, 10 nm/min scanning speed in continuous mode, and 3 accumulations per measurement. The protein was reduced with 1 mm DTT and 20 μm 2-mercaptoethanol for 3 h, the CD spectra were recorded again, and the background was subtracted from observed ellipticities and converted into mean molar ellipticity per residue. The relative secondary structures were calculated using SELCON3, CDSSTR, and CONTINLL included in the CDpro spectra analysis package using a reference set of 43 proteins. A weighted average of the outputs of the three programs was considered reliable for estimating the secondary structure content of the protein. Stable cell lines expressing WT TSHR, LHR, and FSHR were created in HEK293 background and characterized as described previously (7Agrawal G. Dighe R.R.

LRR- and ECD-deleted mutants and the activating mutations of TSHR and LHR used in the this study were created as described earlier for FSHR (7Agrawal G. Dighe R.R.

Chem. 2009; 284: 2636-2647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, modified pcDNA3.1-MycHis vectors (Invitrogen) were created containing the signal peptides of TSHR/LHR/FSHR (pCDNA3.1-SP) and the DNA fragments encoding the receptors without their LRRs (TSHR HinTMD, aa 261–764; LHR HinTMD, aa 265–699; FSHR HinTMD, aa 260–695) and without their entire ECDs (TSHR TMD, aa 414–764; LHR TMD, aa 355–699; FSHR TMD, aa 367–695) of GpHRs were cloned downstream of the respective cognate signal peptides to ensure proper translocation to the cell surface. The hinge region activating mutations S281I, gain-of-function mutation in TSHR ECL 1/2/3-I486T, -I568F, and -V656F, and the inactivating mutation D410N were introduced into TSHR wild type background using a two-step PCR-based mutagenesis (26Wang W. Malcolm B.A. Two-stage polymerase chain reaction protocol allowing introduction of multiple mutations, deletions, and insertions using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis.Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 182: 37-43PubMed Google Scholar). The LHR hinge region mutation S277Q corresponding to the TSHR S281I mutant and the activating mutations in the LHR TMD at TMH6 (D578Y) were similarly created. The TSHR/LHR chimeric receptor (TSH-LHR-6) and the LHR TMH3 activating mutant, L457R, were kind gifts of Profs. Basil Rapoport (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA) and Deborah Segaloff (University of Iowa, USA), respectively. Antibodies against the mini-TMD protein were generated as described earlier (27Dighe R.R. Moudgal N.R. Use of α- and β-subunit specific antibodies in studying interaction of hCG with Leydig cell receptors.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 225: 490-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein (500 μg) emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant was administered to adult rabbit subcutaneously at multiple sites. The treatment was repeated 21 days later followed by another injection in Freund's incomplete adjuvant after another 21 days. The subsequent saline boosters (200 μg) were administered at intervals of 30 days, and the animals were bled after 10 days. IgGs were purified from the antisera using protein G chromatography. The antibodies, referred to hereafter as the mini-TMD antibodies, were characterized for specific binding to its cognate antigen fragment in ELISA and to all three GpHRs using immunoblotting and flow cytometry. HEK293 cells seeded into 6-well (∼106 cells/well/2 ml), 24-well (∼3 × 105 cells/well/500 μl), or 48-well (∼105 cells/well/250 μl) plates were transiently transfected with WT or mutated GpHR constructs (3.2 μg of the plasmid DNA/ml of the plating medium) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent as per the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen), and the transgene expression studies were carried out 48 h later. In each experiment parallel plates were transfected simultaneously to determine the ligand binding to the intact cells and membrane preparations, flow cytometric analysis, and cAMP production as described elsewhere (24Majumdar R. Dighe R.R. The hinge region of human thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor operates as a tunable switch between hormone binding and receptor activation.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e40291Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Binding characteristics of the WT and mutant receptors were investigated as described earlier (7Agrawal G. Dighe R.R. Critical involvement of the hinge region of the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor in the activation of the receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 2636-2647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, the membrane preparations obtained from the cell lines expressing TSHR/LHR/FSHR (∼50 μg/ml) were incubated with respective radioiodinated hormones (∼ 0.14 nm 125I-labeled hormone, specific activity of the tracer ∼ 0.26 μCi/fmol) at 37 °C for 1 h in a reaction volume of 200 μl. At the end of the incubation, PEG8000 was added (final concentration 2.5%) at 4 °C, and the hormone-receptor complex was separated by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 20 min and the supernatant discarded. The pellet was counted for radioactivity in the PerkinElmer Life Sciences γ-counter. The nonspecific binding was determined by adding excess unlabeled hormone (0.5 μg/tube). Each binding experiment was carried out in duplicate and repeated at least two times. Whenever the effect of antibodies on hormone-receptor interactions was investigated, the receptor preparations were preincubated first with different concentrations of the antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C followed by the addition of the labeled hormone and continued incubation for one more hour. The bound hormone-receptor complex was determined as described above. Similarly, to determine the effect of antibodies on hormone response, 105 cells/well (stable cell line or transiently transfected) were plated in a 48-well plate and 24 h later incubated with fresh medium containing 1 mm phosphodiesterase"

We retrospectively evaluated the use of recent, short, historical time-series for recognizing the onset of community outbreaks of respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Methods The data used referred to the proportion of diagnoses for upper or lower RTIs to total diagnoses for house-call visits, performed by a private network of medical specialists (SOS Doctors) in the metropolitan area of Athens, Greece, between January 01, 2000 and October 12, 2008. The reference standard classification of the observations was obtained by generating epidemic thresholds after analyzing the full 9-year period. We evaluated two different alert generating methods [simple regression and cumulative sum (CUSUM), respectively], under a range of input parameters, using data for the previous running 4–6 week period. These methods were applied if the previous weeks contained non-aberrant observations. Results We found that the CUSUM model with a specific set of parameters performed marginally better than simple regression for both groups. The best results (sensitivity, specificity) for simple regression and CUSUM models for upper RTIs were (1.00, 0.82) and (0.94, 0.93) respectively. Corresponding results for lower RTIs were (1.00, 0.80) and (0.93, 0.91) respectively. Conclusions Short-term data for house-call visits can be used rather reliably to identify respiratory tract outbreaks in the community using simple regression and CUSUM methods. Such surveillance models could be particularly useful when a large historical database is either unavailable or inaccurate and, thus, traditional methods are not optimal."
