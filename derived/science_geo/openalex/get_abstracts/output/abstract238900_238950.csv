https://openalex.org/W2030194693,"Downregulation of E-cadherin is a crucial event for epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in embryonic development and cancer progression. Using the EpFosER mammary tumour model we show that during EMT, upregulation of the transcriptional regulator deltaEF1 coincided with transcriptional repression of E-cadherin. Ectopic expression of deltaEF1 in epithelial cells was sufficient to downregulate E-cadherin and to induce EMT. Analysis of E-cadherin promoter activity and chromatin immunoprecipitation identified deltaEF1 as direct transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin. In human cancer cells, transcript levels of deltaEF1 correlated directly with the extent of E-cadherin repression and loss of the epithelial phenotype. The protein was enriched in nuclei of human cancer cells and physically associated with the E-cadherin promoter. RNA interference-mediated downregulation of deltaEF1 in cancer cells was sufficient to derepress E-cadherin expression and restore cell to cell adhesion, suggesting that deltaEF1 is a key player in late stage carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2074081620,"NF-κB transcription factors are retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive form until they are activated and rapidly imported into the nucleus. We identified importin α3 and importin α4 as the main importin α isoforms mediating TNF-α-stimulated NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer translocation into the nucleus. Importin α3 and α4 are close relatives in the human importin α family. We show that importin α3 isoform also mediates nuclear import of NF-κB p50 homodimer in nonstimulated cells. Importin α3 is shown to directly bind to previously characterized nuclear localization signals (NLSs) of NF-κB p50 and p65 proteins. Importin α molecules are known to have armadillo repeats that constitute the N-terminal and C-terminal NLS binding sites. We demonstrate by site-directed mutagenesis that NF-κB p50 binds to the N-terminal and p65 to the C-terminal NLS binding site of importin α3. In vitro competition experiments and analysis of cellular NF-κB suggest that NF-κB binds to importin α only when it is free of IκBα. The present study demonstrates that the nuclear import of NF-κB is a highly regulated process mediated by a subset of importin α molecules.

Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 3-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic NF-κB can be rapidly activated by various physiological and nonphysiological stimuli such as cytokines, growth factors, bacterial or viral infection and UV irradiation. Activation of NF-κB is followed by its rapid translocation into the nucleus where it activates the transcription of numerous genes including those encoding for cytokines and cell adhesion molecules. Some genes can be transcriptionally up-regulated within minutes after NF-κB activation (2Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4585) Google Scholar, 4Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5552) Google Scholar). NF-κB transcription factors are dimers belonging to the Rel family (5Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). All five mammalian NF-κB subunits, p65 (RelA), RelB, c-Rel, p50 (and its precursor p105), and p52 (and its precursor p100) contain an N-terminal Rel homology domain responsible for their dimerization, nuclear localization, and DNA binding (6Siebenlist U.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). NF-κB subunits can form various dimers, but the classical, best characterized form is composed of p50 and p65 (1Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D.

Biol. 1995; 15: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). p65, RelB, and c-Rel contain a C-terminal transcription activation domain, and they can therefore form transcription-activating dimers with each other and with p50 or p52. p50 and p52 proteins lack the transcription activation domain, and the homodimers they form are mostly suppressors of gene expression (9Zhong H. May M.J. Jimi E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). NF-κB dimer is held in an inactive state in the cytoplasm by an inhibitor protein (IκB) that masks the NLSs of the subunits (10Beg A.A. Ruben S.M. Scheinman R.I. Haskill S. Rosen C.A.

Other IκB molecules found in higher vertebrates include IκBβ, IκBϵ, and Bcl3. All IκB molecules contain ankyrin repeats, which mediate specific interactions with the Rel-homology domains of NF-κB molecules. The C-terminal regions of p100 and p105 proteins also contain ankyrin repeats and they can function as an IκB (2Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev.

As a consequence, the NLSs of p50 and p65 proteins are unmasked, and the dimers are translocated into the nucleus where they activate NF-κB responsive genes. p50/p65 heterodimers and p50 homodimers are considered the most abundant NF-κB types in most cells. p50 homodimer formation has been suggested to take place cotranslationally. During this process p50/p105 intermediates are formed, where the C-terminal ankyrin repeat containing domain of p105 functions as an IκB (IκBγ). Additional post-translational steps regulate p50 homodimer formation (14Rice N.R. MacKichan M.L. Israel A. Cell. 1992; 71: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 29Karin M.

Under nonstimulated conditions 10–20% of p105 proteins are processed to form p50 homodimers (32Ciechanover A. Gonen H. Bercovich B. Cohen S. Fajerman I. Israel A. Mercurio F. Kahana C. Schwartz A.L. Iwai K. Orian A. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The affinity between p50 and p65 proteins is stronger than between two p50 proteins, but the actual mechanism of p50/p65 heterodimer formation in the cytoplasm is poorly understood (18Chen F.E. Huang D.B. Chen Y.Q. Ghosh G. Nature. 1998; 391: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 31Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4712-4722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Eukaryotic cells are compartmentalized by the nuclear envelope into the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The nuclear envelope contains nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), which mediate the molecular traffic between the two compartments. The nucleocytoplasmic traffic of large molecules (>25 nm in diameter) is regulated by specific nuclear import and export systems. Proteins that contain classical NLSs are imported into the nucleus by importin α/β heterodimers. Importin α binds to NLS containing proteins, and importin β is responsible for the docking of the importin-cargo complex to the cytoplasmic side of the NPC followed by translocation of the complex through the NPC (33Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar, 34Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). A classical monopartite NLS consists of a stretch of basic amino acids, arginines and lysines (35Morin N. Delsert C. Klessig D.F.

Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). Classical NLSs are found in p50 and p65 (37Gilmore T.D. Temin H.M. J.

Recent studies have shown that some signaling molecules are transported into the nucleus by NLS- and importin-independent processes by associating directly with proteins of the NPC (39Xu L. Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Six importin α family members have been identified in humans; importin α1 (Rch1, hSRP1α), importin α3 (Qip1), importin α4 (hSRP1γ), importin α5 (hSRP1, NPI1), importin α6, and importin α7 (40Cuomo C.A.

Importin α molecules contain a large central domain that consists of 10 tandemly repeated armadillo (arm) motifs, which mediate the interactions with the NLS-containing cargo protein. Each importin α molecule has two potential NLS binding sites that directly interact with the NLS of the cargo. The arm repeats 2–4 comprise the N-terminal NLS binding site and the arm repeats 7–9 the C-terminal NLS binding site (46Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J.

We now report that TNF-α-induced nuclear import of NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimers is mediated by importin α3 and importin α4. Importin α3 is also involved in uninduced import of p50 homodimers. Importin α molecules bind to the previously identified NLSs of p50 and p65 proteins. Moreover, by site-directed mutagenesis we show that p50 is bound by the N-terminal and p65 by the C-terminal NLS binding site of importin α3.

For immunoprecipitation anti-p50 (sc-1191; 5 μg/reaction; goat polyclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-p65 (sc-372x; 5 μg/reaction; goat polyclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) immunoglobulins were used. For confocal laser microscopy rabbit anti-p50 (H-119x; 1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-c-Myc (sc-789; 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or mouse anti-FLAG M5 (1:400; Sigma) and anti-Penta-His (1:50; Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) antibodies were used. Secondary antibodies used were FITC-labeled sheep anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 fragment (1:100; Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and Rhodamine Red-X-labeled goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (1:100; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Cells, Media, and Other Reagents—Human A549 lung carcinoma cell line (ATCC, CCL 185) was maintained in continuous culture in minimum Eagle's medium-α (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.6 μg/ml penicillin, 60 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (Integro, Zaandam, the Netherlands). Human hepatocellular carcinoma HuH7 (49Nakabayashi H. Taketa K. Miyano K. Yamane T. Sato J. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 3858-3863PubMed Google Scholar) cells were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium-α with supplements as above. In transfection experiments the cells were cultured in the growth medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum. Human tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was purchased from R&D systems (Abingdon, UK). For cell stimulation 5 ng/ml of TNF-α was used. Leptomycin B (LMB) (10 μg/ml) was kindly provided by Dr. Minoru Yoshida from The University of Tokyo, Japan. Monolayers and suspension cultures of Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells that were used for baculovirus expression were maintained in TNM-FH medium as described previously (50Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1986; 1555: 1-57Google Scholar). For in vitro translation 35S-labeled PRO.MIX (>100 Ci/mmol) was used, and it was obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Buchinghamshire, UK). Plasmids and DNA Manipulations—Escherichia coli-produced GST-importins α1, α3, α5, α7, and β as well as the mutants in the arm repeats 3 and 8 of importin α3 have been described previously (48Melén K. Fagerlund R. Franke J. Köhler M. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28193-28200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To create arm repeat 7 mutations to GST-importin α3 we used Quick-Change™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The primer used was 5′-GAG AAA ATT AAT AAA GAA GCA GTG GCC TTC CTC TCC GCC ATC ACT GCA GGA AAT CAG CAG CAG. Human p50 and p65 cDNAs in plasmids RcCMV and pCMV were kindly provided by Dr. Jorma Palvimo (University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland) and Dr. John Hiscott (McGill University, Montreal, Canada), respectively. To create NLS mutations to p50 and p65 the primers were 5′-CAA AGA TAA AGA AGA AGT GCA GAG GGC AGC TCA GAA GCT CAT GCC CAA TTT TTC G (p50 NLS: K362A, R363A) and 5′-GAT CGT CAC CGG ATT GAG GAG GCA GCT GCA AGG ACA TAT GAG ACC TTC AAG AGC (p65 NLS: K301A, R302A, K303A). To create FLAG-tagged p50 and c-Myc-His-tagged p65 transient transfection constructs for indirect immunofluorescence and confocal laser microscopy, wild type and mutated cDNAs were modified by PCR to create N- and C-terminal BamHI and BglII sites, respectively, for further cloning into the BamHI site of FLAG-pcDNA3.1(+) (51Melén K.

All DNA manipulations were performed according to standard protocols. To create a GST fusion vector for the baculovirus expression system, GST-encoding cDNA was first modified by PCR using the pGEX-2T fusion vector (Amersham Biosciences) as a template. To modify an N-terminal GST with a new BamHI cloning site the primers were 5′-A GAA AAC (AGA TCT) ACC ATG TCC CCT ATA CTA GGT TAT TG (5′-oligonucleotide) and 5′-G TGG TGC (AGA TCT) TTA GGA TCC ACG CGG AAC CAG ATC CGA TTT TG (3′-oligonucleotide, BglII sites in parentheses, ATG and STOP codons underlined, and the newly created BamHI cloning site in bold face). The PCR product was first digested with BglII and then subcloned into the BamHI cloning site of the pAcYM1 baculovirus expression vector (50Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn.

Production of GST Fusion Proteins in E. coli and Sf9 Cells, and Preparation of Cell Lysate from A549 Cells—Human importins α1, α3, α5, α7, and β as well as mutants in the arm repeats 3, 3+8, and 7+8of importin α3 were expressed in E. coli BL21 cells as GST fusion proteins at +21 °C for 4 h under 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. Bacteria were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA and 1% Triton X-100 (lysis (L) buffer) with 5 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) and protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland) for 30 min at room temperature, briefly sonicated, and clarified by Eppendorf centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 5 min). For protein production of GST-tagged human importin α1, α3, α4, α7, p50, and p65 in Sf9 cells, the cells were first infected with importin, p50 or p65-expressing baculoviruses for 42 h and then collected, and whole cell extracts were prepared by disrupting the cells in l-buffer on ice for 10 min. The cells were disrupted by passing them through a syringe. Cell extracts were clarified by Eppendorf centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 10 min). For preparation of cell lysate, A549 cells were stimulated with TNF-α (5 ng/ml) or left nonstimulated. The cells were washed, harvested, and lysed in l-buffer containing 1 mm NaVO4 and protease inhibitors on ice for 10 min. The cells were disrupted by passing them through a syringe. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at +4 °C for 10 min. Importin Binding Assay, Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blotting—For GST pull-down experiments, GST fusion proteins were first allowed to bind to 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) at +4 °C for 60 min in L-buffer followed by washing twice with the buffer. 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose-immobilized GST fusion proteins was mixed with 200 μl of cell lysate and rotated at +4 °C for 2 h followed by washing three times with L-buffer. Sepharose beads were dissolved in 30 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and the proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE (52Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (polyvinylidine difluoride; Millipore, Bedford, MA) followed by staining with primary and secondary antibodies and visualization of the proteins with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturer. To detect the binding of in vitro translated proteins in GST pull-down experiments, 25 to 50 μlof in vitro translated p50, p65, or IκBα proteins (TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate systems, Promega) were allowed to bind to 25 μl of Sepharose-immobilized GST-importin on ice for 60 min followed by washing three times with l-buffer. GST importin-bound 35S-labeled proteins were dissolved in 30 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. The gels were fixed and treated with Amplify reagent (Amersham Biosciences) as specified by the manufacturer and autoradiographed. For immunoprecipitation experiments, 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was incubated with 5 μg of goat immunoglobulins against NF-κB p50 or NF-κB p65 proteins in L-buffer for 1 h, followed by washing three times with the buffer. Protein A-Sepharose beds were then mixed with 1 ml of A549 cell lysate (stimulated with TNF-α (5 ng/ml) for 30 min or left nonstimulated), rotated at +4 °C for 6 h, followed by washing twice with l-buffer and once with washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA). Proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and Western blots were stained with rabbit immunoglobulins against p50, p65, importin α3, and IκBα. Oligonucleotide Precipitation—A549 cells were stimulated with 5 ng/ml of TNF-α for 0, 15, 30, or 60 min. The cells were collected, and samples were treated as described by Rosen et al. (53Rosen R.L. Winestock K.D. Chen G. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Finbloom D.S. Blood. 1996; 88: 1206-1214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upper strands of CCL5 (RANTES) (5′-gga tcc CTC CCC TTA GGG GAT GCC CCT CAA CT) and CXCL10 (IP-10) (5′-gga tcc GCA GAG GGA AAT TCC GTA ACT TGG) promoter NF-κB elements were synthesized with BamHI overhangs as spacers, and they were 5′-biotinylated (DNA Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Lower strands were nonbiotinylated. Oligonucleotides were annealed in 0.5 m NaCl and incubated with streptavidin-agarose beads (Neutravidin; Pierce) at +4 °C for 2 h in a ratio to yield maximum saturation of the beads with the biotinylated oligonucleotide. The samples were incubated with the agarose beads saturated with the oligonucleotide at +4 °C for 2 h in binding buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 133 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaVO4, and protease inhibitors. After washing oligonucleotide-bound proteins were dissolved in 75 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes and visualized with antibodies against p50 and p65 proteins. Indirect Immunofluorescence and Confocal Laser Microscopy—For indirect immunofluorescence and confocal laser microscopy transiently transfected HuH7 cells were grown on glass coverslips. Cells were left untreated or pretreated with LMB (2 ng/ml) (54Kudo N. Khochbin S. Nishi K. Kitano K. Yanagida M. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29742-29751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) for 20 min followed by stimulation with TNF-α (100 ng/ml) in the presence of LMB (2 ng/ml) for 30 min. The cells were fixed with methanol at –20 °C for 10 min and processed for immunofluorescence as previously described (55Melén K. Keskinen P. Ronni T. Sareneva T. Lounatmaa K. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23478-23486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The cells positive for FLAG, c-Myc, and His tags or expressing native p50 protein, as indicated in the figures, were visualized and photographed on a Leica TCS NT confocal microscope. NF-κB Binds to Importin α3 and Importin α4—Upon activation NF-κB is translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. The nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of NF-κB has been thought to be mediated via importin α/β- and exportin 1-dependent pathways. However, the molecular mechanisms of the nuclear import of NF-κB have remained unknown. To investigate the possible interactions of NF-κB with different importin isoforms, we stimulated human A549 lung carcinoma cells with TNF-α. Different expression systems were used for importin α3, since all isoforms could not be expressed in E. coli or by baculovirus expression. Cell extracts were prepared, and the cellular proteins were allowed to bind to Sepharose-immobilized bacterially expressed GST-importins α1, α3, α5, α7, or β (Fig. 1A) or baculovirus-expressed GST-importins α1, α3, α4, or α7 (Fig. 1B).

https://openalex.org/W2164470499,"KLF4/GKLF normally functions in differentiating epithelial cells, but also acts as a transforming oncogene in vitro. To examine the role of this zinc finger protein in skin, we expressed the wild-type human allele from inducible and constitutive promoters. When induced in basal keratinocytes, KLF4 rapidly abolished the distinctive properties of basal and parabasal epithelial cells. KLF4 caused a transitory apoptotic response and the skin progressed through phases of hyperplasia and dysplasia. By 6 weeks, lesions exhibited nuclear KLF4 and other morphologic and molecular similarities to squamous cell carcinoma in situ. p53 determined the patch size sufficient to establish lesions, as induction in a mosaic pattern produced skin lesions only when p53 was deficient. Compared with p53 wild-type animals, p53 hemizygous animals had early onset of lesions and a pronounced fibrovascular response that included outgrowth of subcutaneous sarcoma. A KLF4-estrogen receptor fusion protein showed tamoxifen-dependent nuclear localization and conditional transformation in vitro. The results suggest that KLF4 can function in the nucleus to induce squamous epithelial dysplasia, and indicate roles for p53 and epithelial–mesenchymal signaling in these early neoplastic lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2039633981,"This study aimed to (a) determine if DNA methylation is a mechanism of WWOX (WW domain containing oxidoreductase) and FHIT (fragile histidine triad) inactivation in lung, breast and bladder cancers; (b) examine distinct methylation patterns in neoplastic and adjacent tissues and (c) seek correlation of methylation patterns with disease status. Protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry, and methylation status by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and sequencing, in lung squamous cell carcinomas and adjacent tissues, invasive breast carcinomas, adjacent tissues and normal mammary tissues and bladder transitional cell carcinomas. Wwox and Fhit expression was reduced in cancers in association with hypermethylation. Differential patterns of WWOX and FHIT methylation were observed in neoplastic vs adjacent non-neoplastic tissues, suggesting that targeted MSP amplification could be useful in following treatment or prevention protocols. WWOX promoter MSP differentiates DNA of lung cancer from DNA of adjacent lung tissue. WWOX and FHIT promoter methylation is detected in tissue adjacent to breast cancer and WWOX exon 1 MSP distinguishes breast cancer DNA from DNA of adjacent and normal tissue. Differential methylation in cancerous vs adjacent tissues suggests that WWOX and FHIT hypermethylation analyses could enrich a panel of DNA methylation markers."
https://openalex.org/W1981320044,"GPR56 (also known as TM7XN1) is a newly discovered orphan G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) of the secretin family that has a role in the development of neural progenitor cells and has been linked to developmental malformations of the human brain. GPR56 diverges from other secretin-like family members in that it has an extremely large N-terminal extracellular region (381 amino acids) and contains a novel feature among this new subclass, consisting of four cysteine residues that define a GPCR proteolytic site (GPS motif) located just before the first transmembrane spanning domain. The rest of the amino-terminal domain contains a large number of possible N- and O-linked glycosylation sites similar to mucin-like proteins. These features suggest a role in cell-cell, or cell-matrix interactions. Here, we demonstrate upregulation of GPR56 in glioblastoma multiforme tumors using functional genomics. Immunohistochemistry studies confirmed the expression of GPR56 protein in a majority of glioblastoma/astrocytoma tumor samples with undetectable levels of expression in normal adult brain tissue. Immunofluorescence analysis of human glioma cells using anti-GPR56 antibodies demonstrate that GPR56 is expressed on the leading edge of membrane filopodia and colocalizes with alpha-actinin. Purified recombinant GPR56 extracellular domain protein inhibits glioma cell adhesion and causes abnormal cytoskeletal morphology and cell rounding. These results indicate that the extracellular domain may compete for unidentified ligand(s), and block the normal function of GPR56 in cell attachment. In reporter assays, overexpression of GPR56 activates the NF-kappaB, PAI-1 and TCF transcriptional response elements. These pathways have been implicated in cytoskeletal signaling, adhesion and tumor biology. The above results indicate that GPR56 serves as an adhesion GPCR and is involved in adhesion signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2105602420,"Orchestration of the rapid formation and reorganization of new tissue observed in wound healing involves not only cells and polypeptides but also the extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment. The ability of heparan sulfate (HS) to interact with major components of the ECM suggests a key role for HS in maintaining the structural integrity of the ECM. Heparanase, an endoglycosidase-degrading HS in the ECM and cell surface, is involved in the enzymatic machinery that enables cellular invasion and release of HS-bound polypeptides residing in the ECM. Bioavailabilty and activation of multitude mediators capable of promoting cell migration, proliferation, and neovascularization are of particular importance in the complex setting of wound healing. We provide evidence that heparanase is normally expressed in skin and in the wound granulation tissue. Heparanase stimulated keratinocyte cell migration and wound closure in vitro. Topical application of recombinant heparanase significantly accelerated wound healing in a flap/punch model and markedly improved flap survival. These heparanase effects were associated with enhanced wound epithelialization and blood vessel maturation. Similarly, a marked elevation in wound angiogenesis, evaluated by MRI analysis and histological analyses, was observed in heparanase-overexpressing transgenic mice. This effect was blocked by a novel, newly developed, heparanase-inhibiting glycol-split fragment of heparin. These results clearly indicate that elevation of heparanase levels in healing wounds markedly accelerates tissue repair and skin survival that are mediated primarily by an enhanced angiogenic response.-Zcharia, E., Zilka, R., Yaar, A., Yacoby-Zeevi, O., Zetser, A., Metzger, S., Sarid, R., Naggi, A., Casu, B., Ilan, N., Vlodavsky, I., Abramovitch, R.

https://openalex.org/W2038295718,"Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), an oncoprotein encoded by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), is an integral membrane protein, which acts like a constitutively active receptor. LMP1 is critical for some facet of EBV's induction and maintenance of proliferation of infected B cells. It, in part, mimics signaling by the CD40 receptor and has been implicated in regulating proliferation, survival, or both properties of EBV-infected cells. We established a conditional LMP1 allele in the context of the intact EBV genome to define the immediate-early cellular target genes regulated by LMP1 in order to assess its contributions to infected human B cells. The functional analysis of this conditional system indicated that LMP1 specifically induces mitogenic B-cell activation through c-myc and Jun/AP1 family members and confirms its direct role in upregulating expression of multiple genes with opposing activities involved in cell survival. LMP1's signals were found to be essential for the G1/S transition in human B cells; cells lacking LMP1's signals are cell cycle arrested and survive quiescently. LMP1's activities are therefore not required to maintain survival in nonproliferating cells. LMP1 does induce both pro- and antiapoptotic genes whose balance seems to permit survival during LMP1's induction and maintenance of proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2047932097,"Unlike lower eukaryotes, mammalian genomes have a second gene, ATP2C2, encoding a putative member of the family of secretory pathway Ca2+,Mn2+-ATPases, SPCA2. Human SPCA2 shares 64% amino acid identity with the protein defective in Hailey Hailey disease, hSPCA1. We show that human SPCA2 (hSPCA2) has a more limited tissue distribution than hSPCA1, with prominent protein expression in brain and testis. In primary neuronal cells, endogenous SPCA2 has a highly punctate distribution that overlaps with vesicles derived from the trans-Golgi network and is thus different from the compact perinuclear distribution of hSPCA1 seen in keratinocytes and nonpolarized cells. Heterologous expression in a yeast strain lacking endogenous Ca2+ pumps reveals further functional differences from hSPCA1. Although the Mn2+-specific phenotype of hSPCA2 is similar to that of hSPCA1, Ca2+ ions are transported with much poorer affinity, resulting in only weak complementation of Ca2+-specific yeast phenotypes. These observations suggest that SPCA2 may have a more specialized role in mammalian cells, possibly in cellular detoxification of Mn2+ ions, similar to that in yeast. We point to the close links between manganese neurotoxicity and Parkinsonism that would predict an important physiological role for SPCA2 in the brain.

The founding member of this family, Pmr1 (for plasma membrane ATPase-related) was first described in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (3Rudolph H.K. Antebi A. Fink G.R. Buckley C.M. Dorman T.E.

Shull G.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7600-7608Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Pmr1 was shown to be biochemically distinct from the well known Ca2+-ATPases that reside in the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum (SERCA) and plasma membrane (PMCA) of higher eukaryotes (6Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Of particular interest, Pmr1 has an unusual selectivity toward Mn2+ ions and plays a prominent role in cellular detoxification of this trace element as well as in Mn2+ delivery to the Golgi lumen, where it is an essential cofactor for endogly-cosidases (7Lapinskas P.J.

Also noteworthy is the strikingly high affinity of Pmr1 for Ca2+ and Mn2+ ions, indicated by Km values of less than 0.1 μm for ion transport and ion-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity (9Mandal D.

Single orthologues of PMR1 are found in the genomes of nematodes and Drosophila, whereas there are two paralogous genes in mammals, including humans. Heterologous expression studies of C. elegans PMR1 and human SPCA1 in COS1 cells and in yeast have confirmed Mn2+ transport ability and a similar high affinity for Ca2+ in the range of 0.25 μm, suggesting that these are shared features of the SPCA family (12Van Baelen K.

Haploinsufficiency of hSPCA1, caused by mutations in one allele of the ATP2C1 gene, leads to Hailey Hailey disease, a debilitating blistering disorder of the skin characterized by disruption of desmosomal contacts in keratinocytes (15Hu Z.

Horst R.L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C1595-C1602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, potentially, into bone and teeth. Based on the known properties of these transporters, the SPCA family is likely to be important for uptake, detoxification, and homeostasis of calcium and manganese in the intestine, liver, and brain, respectively. However, molecular aspects of mammalian SPCA function remain to be determined, and experimental evidence for their physiological role is scarce. The widespread expression pattern of SPCA1 and the absence of homozygous mutations in the ATP2C1 gene are both consistent with an essential housekeeping role for this isoform (15Hu Z. Bonifas J.M. Beech J. Bench G. Shigihara T. Ogawa H. Ikeda S. Mauro T. Epstein Jr., E.H. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In contrast, a cDNA clone from human brain, KIAA0703, corresponding to a second SPCA isoform, was reported to have a more limited tissue distribution (18Ishikawa K. Nagase T. Suyama M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Initial attempts to evaluate the function of this clone failed 2Y. Wei, D. Mandal, and R. Rao, unpublished results. and appeared to be due to an incorrect N-terminal sequence, presumably the result of a cloning artifact. We now report that the corrected clone encodes a functional SPCA pump that clearly differs from hSPCA1 in its ability to complement the phenotypes of a pmr1 null strain of yeast. Biochemical characterization of hSPCA2 in yeast and subcellular localization in primary hippocampal cells reveal novel properties that may contribute to a distinct physiological role. Plasmids, Yeast Strains, and Growth Medium—Plasmids pKT17yE, expressing the His9-tagged long N-terminal splice variant of hSPCA1, and YEpHisPMR1, expressing His9-tagged S. cerevisiae PMR1 have been described before (11Wei Y. Marchi V. Wang R. Rao R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14534-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Ton V.K. Rao R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2004; 23: 1192-1194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (23) Google Scholar). cDNA clone KIAA0703 (gift of the Kazusa Research Institute, Japan) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction to include an N-terminal MluI site immediately prior to codon 1 (ATG) and a NotI site following the termination codon and subsequently cloned into the equivalent sites of plasmid pSM1052 (gift from Susan Michaelis, The Johns Hopkins University). This placed the open reading frame behind a His9 epitope tag and under control of the constitutive PGK1 promoter, as described earlier for S. cerevisiae PMR1 (11Wei Y. Marchi V. Wang R. Rao R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14534-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The resulting clone, YEpPGK-KIAA0703, was unable to complement the phenotypes of a pmr1Δ strain and was judged to be nonfunctional. Examination of the N-terminal sequence revealed it to be similar to intronic sequences in the genome and highly hydrophobic, such that an additional membrane span would be introduced at the start of the protein, inverting the topology of the remaining membrane spans. Therefore, the N-terminal sequence of KIAA0703 was replaced with the corresponding sequence from cDNA clone DKFZp68I0955 as follows. A 641-bp PCR product corresponding to the N terminus of cDNA clone DKFZp68I0955 from RZPD (Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum fuer Genomforschung GmbH in Berlin, Germany) was amplified using the antisense primer (GAGGTCCGTGACCTCAGTGAGTCG) and an MluI-containing sense primer (GCGCACGCGTGTCGAGGGACGaGTCTCCGAGTTCCTGAAG; MluI site underlined; a silent mutation shown in lowercase was introduced to abolish the only internal MluI site within the hSPCA2 gene). The PCR fragment was digested with MluI and BamHI, and the resulting fragment (604 base pairs) was inserted into the same restriction sites to correct the N-terminal sequence in plasmid YEpPGK-KIAA0703 described above. It is worth noting that clone DKFZp68I0955 also carries an apparent cloning artifact in the form of an in-frame insert of 29 amino acids within the highly conserved transmembrane domain M6, not represented in the human genome sequence, and is therefore also likely to be nonfunctional. The open reading frame we have constructed from these two incorrect clones is identical to that of the recently deposited RZPD cDNA, DKFZp686H22230, except for a polymorphism at amino acid position 466 (Leu replaces Met). Yeast strain K616 (pmr1Δpmc1Δcnb1Δ; referred as pmr1 in the figures) has been shown to be devoid of endogenous Ca2+-ATPase activity (6Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and was used as host for heterologous expression of hSPCA1 and hSPCA2. Yeast cultures were grown in SC medium with supplements as appropriate.

Cultures were incubated at 30 °C for 72 h, and cell density was measured as A600 in a FLUOStar Optima plate reader (BMG Labtechnologies). Antibody Generation and Purification—Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against a 14-amino acid peptide of hSPCA2 (30EEALIDEQSELKAI43C). hSPCA2 peptide (1 mg/ml) was immobilized on SulfoLink Coupling Gel (Pierce) through the C-terminal cysteine according to the manufacturer's instructions. Peptide-specific antibodies were purified from antiserum as described (20Dumont R.A. Lins U. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Kachar B. Gillespie P.G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5066-5078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), concentrated by Centricon filtration (YM30; Millipore Corp.), and stored in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.02% NaN3 at 4 °C. Immunofluorescence—Postnatal rat hippocampal neurons were a generous gift of Radhika Reddy, Richard Cho, and Paul Worley of The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Cultures were grown on collagen-coated glass coverslips at low densities, as described (Div 6; Ref. 21Liao D. Zhang X. O'Brien R. Ehlers M.D. Huganir R.L. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed, and then permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Following additional washes in phosphate-buffered saline and blocking with bovine serum albumin (10% for 60 min), the coverslips were incubated with affinity-purified anti-hSPCA2 antibody (1:100 dilution), anti-TGN38 antibody (1:300; BD Transduction Laboratories), or anti-adaptin γ antibody (1: 500; BD Transduction Laboratories) for 1 h. Where specified, antibody was preincubated with hSPCA2 peptide (50 μg) prior to use. Secondary antibodies used were anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (1:400; Molecular Probes) and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 (1:400; Molecular Probes). Cells were imaged on a PerkinElmer UltraView spinning disk confocal microscope. 45Ca Transport—ATP-dependent 45Ca transport was essentially as described (6Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Concanamycin (500 nm; Sigma) and carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone (20 μm; Sigma) were included to inhibit H+/Ca2+ exchange. 45CaCl2 was added to 0.4 μCi/ml in transport assays of sucrose gradient fractions and to 28 μCi/ml in the pooled Golgi fraction. EGTA concentrations were varied to give free Ca2+ concentrations that were calculated according to Wei et al. (11Wei Y. Marchi V. Wang R. Rao R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14534-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Buffers were depleted of contaminating Ca2+ by using Chelex-treated water. The transport assay was terminated by rapid filtration onto 0.45-μm HAWP membranes (Millipore Corp.), and radioactivity associated with vesicles was determined by scintillation counting. Membrane Preparation, SDS-PAGE, and Biochemical Techniques— Yeast lysates were fractionated on 18–54% (w/w) sucrose density gradients as described (6Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Protein determination by a modified Lowry assay, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting was as described (6Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Anti-His antibody (1:5000; BD Biosciences) and anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000; Amersham Biosciences) were used for detection of His-tagged hSPCA2 in sucrose fractions. Sequence Characteristics of hSPCA2—The ATP2C2 gene encoding hSPCA2, a second paralogue of the secretory pathway family of Ca2+ pumps, resides on human chromosome 16. The cDNA for hSPCA2 was pieced together by replacing the incorrect N-terminal sequence from cDNA KIAA0703 with amino acid residues 1–70 from the RZPD clone DKFZp68I0955 to generate a 946-residue polypeptide with 64% sequence identity with hSPCA1 (Fig. 1). Sequences corresponding to the 10 predicted transmembrane domains and cytosolic phosphorylation and ATPase domains are strongly conserved, with significant stretches of differences residing mainly at the N and C termini. Of note, acidic residues identified as ion binding ligands within membrane spans M4, M5, and M6 in Pmr1, as well as an invariant Gln residue in M6 that is critical for Mn2+ selectivity, are completely conserved (9Mandal D. Woolf T. Rao R. J. Biol. Cell. 2000; 273: 23933-23938Google Scholar, 22Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt P.A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A Ca2+-binding EF-hand-like motif characterized within the N terminus of yeast Pmr1 is recognizable by conservative replacements in hSPCA1 but is considerably divergent in hSPCA2 (Fig. 1) (11Wei Y. Marchi V. Wang R. Rao R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14534-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The short C terminus of hSPCA2 has a dileucine motif that may be involved in adaptor-mediated sorting and a potential type III PDZ binding motif, PEDV, at the C terminus that may be important for localization and trafficking (23Heilker R. Manning-Krieg U. Zuber J.F. Spiess M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 24Wang P. Wang X. Pei D. J. Biol.

Tissue Distribution and Subcellular Localization of hSPCA2—Polyclonal antibodies were raised against a unique 14-residue N-terminal sequence of hSPCA2, 30EEALIDEQSELKAI43. Affinity-purified serum recognized a 105-kDa polypeptide corresponding to hSPCA2, expressed in yeast (Fig. 2, A and B). The absence of cross-reactivity against hSPCA1 was confirmed using membranes isolated from yeast strains overexpressing the long N terminus splice variant of ATP2C1 (14Fairclough R.J. Dode L. Vanoevelen J. Andersen J.P. Missiaen L. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. Hovnanian A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24721-24730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 19Ton V.K. Rao R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2004; 23: 1192-1194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (23) Google Scholar). When applied to a human tissue blot, the antibodies showed prominent staining of appropriately sized bands in the brain and testis that were absent from the peptide-blocked antibody control (Fig. 2, C and D). Longer exposure times revealed weaker bands of the same size in other tissues, notably lung, kidney, and spleen (not shown). Expression profiling of KIAA0703 by RT-PCR, reported by Ishikawa et al. (18Ishikawa K. Nagase T. Suyama M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), showed a similar pattern of mRNA in brain, testis, lung, kidney, pancreas, and ovary. Our observations do not preclude the existence of additional splice variants that are not detected by this N-terminal antibody. Overall, the distribution of hSPCA2 appears to be considerably more restricted than that of hSPCA1 (15Hu Z. Bonifas J.M. Beech J. Bench G. Shigihara T. Ogawa H. Ikeda S. Mauro T. Epstein Jr., E.H. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The relatively high levels of expression in the brain prompted us to examine the subcellular localization of endogenous SPCA2 in primary neuronal cell cultures from rats. Anti-hSPCA2 antibodies are expected to cross-react with the rat orthologue, since 10 of 14 residues in the epitope are identical between the two species. Rat hippocampal neurons stained with affinity-purified antibody against the N-terminal peptide of hSPCA2 showed a highly punctate distribution throughout the cell body and dendrites (Fig. 3, a, d, and g). An increased density of perinuclear staining of SPCA2 suggested a close association of these vesicles with the TGN. Although there was moderate overlap with TGN38 in the perinuclear stacks of the trans-Golgi network, we observed extensive overlap in the vesicular structures within the cell body and dendrites (Fig. 3, d–f). This suggested that SPCA2 localized to vesicles derived from the TGN. Indeed, we observed better colocalization between SPCA2 and adaptin-γ, a component of the AP-1 adaptor that mediates vesicle transport from the TGN to late endosomes and secretory granules (Fig. 3, g–i). Thus, in addition to the more compact Golgi/TGN staining of SPCA1 seen in keratinocytes and nonpolarized cells (13Ton V.K. Mandal D. Vahadji C. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6422-6427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 25Missiaen L. Vanoevelen J. Van Acker K. Raeymaekers L. Parys J.B. Callewaert G. Wuytack F. De Smedt H.

Commun. 2003; 306: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), our studies reveal that SPCA pumps may localize predominantly in TGN-derived vesicles. Functional Complementation in Yeast—Heterologous expression of hSPCA2 in yeast can provide valuable functional insights by complementation studies of pmr1Δ cellular phenotypes. The pmr1Δ null strain exhibits a number of growth defects deriving from the loss of high affinity Mn2+ and Ca2+ transport into the secretory pathway that may be complemented by expression of orthologous genes from other organisms. For example, growth sensitivity of pmr1Δ strains to high levels of extracellular Mn2+ is due to cellular accumulation of Mn2+ and can be relieved by sequestration of the toxic cation into the Golgi, from where it can exit the cell through the secretory pathway (7Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X. Fink G.R. Culotta V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Mandal D. Rulli S.J. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35292-35298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We had shown earlier that complementation of Mn2+ hypersensitivity of pmr1Δ is a diagnostic feature of the SPCA pumps that could not be phenocopied by Ca2+-ATPases of the SERCA or PMCA family (13Ton V.K. Mandal D. Vahadji C. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6422-6427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We show that hSPCA2, like hSPCA1, confers high levels of Mn2+ tolerance to PMR1-deficient yeast, consistent with an ability to transport and sequester this ion (Fig. 4A). In order to assess in vivo Ca2+ transport activity of hSPCA2, we monitored growth sensitivity to BAPTA. Hypersensitivity of pmr1Δ strains to divalent cation chelators BAPTA and EGTA appears to be due to an inability to scavenge Ca2+ ions for delivery into the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi compartments, where they are important for protein sorting and quality control (8Dürr G. Strayle J. Plemper R. Elbs S. Klee S.K. Catty P. Wolf D.H. Rudolph H.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Tolerance to EGTA or BAPTA can be conferred by heterologous expression of a variety of high affinity Ca2+-transporting ATPases, including SERCA and PMCA pumps from plants, protozoans, and mammals (8Dürr G. Strayle J. Plemper R. Elbs S. Klee S.K. Catty P. Wolf D.H. Rudolph H.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 13Ton V.K. Mandal D. Vahadji C. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6422-6427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 29Liang F. Sze H. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 30Talla E. de Mendonca R.L. Degand I. Goffeau A. Ghislain M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27831-27840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To our surprise, hSPCA2 only weakly complemented the BAPTA-sensitive phenotype of the pmr1Δ strain (Fig. 4B), suggesting that Ca2+ transport function was altered in some way from that of hSPCA1 and Pmr1 pumps. To corroborate this unexpected result, we also assessed tunicamycin sensitivity, which has also been shown to correlate with a depletion of calcium ions in the endoplasmic reticulum/secretory pathway (8Dürr G. Strayle J. Plemper R. Elbs S. Klee S.K. Catty P. Wolf D.H. Rudolph H.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Yeast strains lacking Pmr1 are hypersensitive to tunicamycin due to defects in handling unfolded proteins. Again, in contrast to hSPCA1, heterologous expression of hSPCA2 only weakly complemented growth sensitivity of the host strain to tunicamycin (Fig. 4C), suggesting a specific deficit in calcium but not manganese sequestration. Based on these data, we reasoned that hSPCA2-transformed yeast would also be defective in cytosolic calcium homeostasis. We have recently shown that the fungicidal effect of the antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone is due to disruption of calcium homeostasis and that hypersensitivity to amiodarone in pmr1Δ strains correlates with loss of Ca2+ rather than Mn2+ transport activity (31Gupta S.S. Ton V.K. Beaudry V. Rulli S. Cunningham K. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28831-28839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We show here that protection against amiodarone toxicity by hSPCA2 is significantly less than that by hSPCA1 (Fig. 4D), consistent with a reduced ability to clear cytoplasmic Ca2+. Taken together, this set of complementation studies suggest that although the Mn2+ transport ability of hSPCA2 is similar to that of hSPCA1, Ca2+ transport may differ. Golgi Localization and 45Ca Transport—To evaluate Ca2+ transport activity of hSPCA2 in vitro, yeast lysates were separated on sucrose density gradients, and ATP-dependent 45Ca pumping activity was determined in individual fractions. Golgi vesicles distribute in the upper third of the density gradient as seen by the peak of 45Ca pumping activity associated with Pmr1 expression (6Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). Introduction of hSPCA2 into the host strain lacking endogenous calcium pumps restored Ca2+ transport activity in the Golgi-associated fractions, indicating a subcellular distribution similar to that of Pmr1 and hSPCA1 in yeast (Fig. 5A). Expression of hSPCA2 polypeptide was detected on Western blots of individual fractions using both anti-His and anti-hSPCA2 antibody and correlated well with 45Ca transport activity (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, maximal transport activity of hSPCA2 in isolated fractions was at similar levels to hSPCA1. Our results thus far, showing similar Ca2+ transport activity and subcellular localization of both hSPCA1 and hSPCA2 expressed in yeast, do not explain the large disparity in Ca2+-related growth phenotypes shown in Fig. 4, B–D. We therefore undertook a more detailed characterization of the ion transport activity of hSPCA2. Subcellular fractions showing peak transport activity (22–34% sucrose) were pooled and collected by centrifugation, and the calcium dependence of 45Ca transport was determined. We show that the average K for Ca2+ transport by hSPCA2 is 1.35 μm, significantly different from the Km values for hSPCA1 (0.25 μm) and yeast Pmr1 (0.07 μm) measured in the same expression system (Fig. 6A) (11Wei Y. Marchi V. Wang R. Rao R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14534-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13Ton V.K. Mandal D. Vahadji C. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6422-6427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus, hSPCA2 appears to have poorer affinity for Ca2+ relative to hSPCA1 and yeast Pmr1. The addition of increasing concentrations of Mn2+ ions resulted in a corresponding decrease of hSPCA2 Ca2+ transport activity, approaching 100% inhibition at the highest concentrations of Mn2+ tested. Inhibition of hSPCA1 by Mn2+ ions was very similar (13Ton V.K. Mandal D. Vahadji C. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6422-6427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), consistent with both isoforms having similar efficacy in conferring Mn2+ tolerance to pmr1Δ yeast. Although this assay does not directly measure Mn2+ transport, prior studies have demonstrated that Mn2+ stimulates phosphoenzyme formation and can be transported by the SPCA pumps (9Mandal D. Woolf T. Rao R. J. Biol. Cell. 2000; 273: 23933-23938Google Scholar, 12Van Baelen K. Vanoevelen J. Missiaen L. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10683-10691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results suggest that hSPCA2 has retained Mn2+ pumping ability but has lost high affinity Ca2+ transport relative to other members of the SPCA family. In contrast to the many decades of well documented studies that elucidate important functions of SERCA and PMCA pumps in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis, the specific functions and raison d'etre of members of the SPCA class are still poorly defined. The absence of homozygous ATP2C1 mutations in humans and the autosomal dominant mode of inheritance of Hailey Hailey disease both point to an apparent essential role for the SPCA in mammalian physiology. They may contribute to maintaining the submicromolar resting levels of cytosolic Ca2+ prerequisite for ubiquitous signaling events, either in a supporting role or more prominently in some cell types such as keratinocytes where Hailey Hailey disease is manifested (32Callewaert G. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. Vanoevelen J. Van Baelen K. Simoni A. Rizzuto R. Missiaen L. Cell Calcium. 2003; 34: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Luminal delivery of ions to Golgi and post-Golgi compartments for protein processing, glycosylation, and secretion is more likely to be a specific function of the SPCA, particularly in vesicles where overlap with the SERCA would be minimal. The high Mn2+ selectivity of the SPCA is not only unique among other classes of Ca2+-ATPases but serves as a defining characteristic common to all members that have been investigated thus far, including the newly identified hSPCA2 isoform reported in this study. We show that like hSPCA1, hSPCA2 confers robust tolerance to Mn2+ toxicity in yeast and is therefore a candidate for Mn2+ uptake or detoxification in tissues in which it is expressed. The relatively high level of hSPCA2 in brain is particularly intriguing, given the observed correlations between manganese neurotoxicity and Parkinson's disease (33Olanow C.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1012: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Manganese is an abundant element that is widely used in industrial applications, including the manufacture of steel and batteries and as an anti-knock additive of gasoline. There is considerable evidence that excessive exposure to Mn2+, particularly when inhaled or in patients with liver disease, causes neuronal loss and gliosis that is most prominent in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra (33Olanow C.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1012: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 34Pal P.K. Samii A. Calne D.B. Neurotoxicology. 1999; 20: 227-238PubMed Google Scholar, 35Burkhard P.R. Delavelle J. Du Pasquier R. Spahr L. Arch. Neurol. 2003; 60: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Our studies showing SPCA2 expression in neuronal cells are consistent with a role in Mn2+ sequestration and detoxification, similar to that in yeast. In support of this function, a recent study documenting protein expression changes in rat brains following manganese exposure showed a prominent up-regulation of an SPCA member (36Zhang S. Fu J. Zhou Z. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2005; 202: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Given the ubiquitous occurrence of hSPCA1, the more limited distribution of hSPCA2 would suggest a specialized role. Indeed, the relatively poor affinity for Ca2+ indicates that this isoform may participate primarily in Mn2+ transport in a cellular context, although we cannot rule out factors such as accessory proteins, phosphorylation, or other forms of regulation that may be absent in a heterologous system but serve to modulate ion affinity. The difference in Ca2+ transport affinity between hSPCA2 and other members of the SPCA family is surprising, given the high level of sequence identity in membrane-spanning regions that are known to bind and transport ions. Sequences corresponding to M4, M5, and M6 in both human isoforms are virtually identical, with few conservative replacements, and all critical residues identified in yeast mutagenesis screens or in Hailey Hailey disease are conserved (2). Therefore, it would appear that regions outside these core membrane helices modulate ion binding and transport. It is possible that the divergent N-terminal sequences of the SPCA pumps serve to modulate ion affinity. An EF-hand motif located within the N-terminal sequence of yeast Pmr1 has been shown to bind Ca2+, and mutations that abolish Ca2+ binding to a fusion of the N terminus with glutathione S-transferase also reduced affinity for Ca2+ transport in the full-length pump (11Wei Y. Marchi V. Wang R. Rao R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14534-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We note a correlation between the degree of conservation of the EF-hand motif and the apparent affinity for Ca2+ transport. Thus, the sequence DXDXNXGX5E in Pmr1 resembles canonical EF hands better than that of hSPCA1, QXDXQXGX4E, whereas the equivalent sequence in hSPCA2 has several nonconservative replacements lacking Ca2+-binding carbonyl groups (underlined), CXDXHXGX4S. There is precedence for N-terminal sequences modulating ion transport in the related P1 subtype of P type ion pumps, which include the copper-ATPases defective in Menkes and Wilson disease. In these pumps, 1–6 discrete metal binding motifs within the long N terminus are thought to regulate ion transport (37Huster D. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32212-32218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although similar modulation by N-terminal sequences has not been reported for pumps of the P2 subtype, which include Ca2+-ATPases, it remains an intriguing possibility. We demonstrate, for the first time, a predominantly vesicular distribution for a member of the SPCA subgroup, distinct from the compact perinuclear Golgi/TGN stacks observed for SPCA1 in keratinocytes and nonpolarized cultured cells. It is likely that the distribution of the SPCA between TGN stacks and TGN-derived vesicles is cell type-dependent and may reflect the balance between export and retrieval of the pumps. It will be of particular interest to determine whether this distribution is Ca2+- or Mn2+-dependent and whether C-terminal motifs associated with PDZ domain binding (PEDV) and retrieval from the plasma membrane (LL) contribute to trafficking. Again, there is precedence for ion-dependent Golgi to vesicular trafficking in the Menkes and Wilson copper ATPases, where similar motifs have been identified (38Greenough M. Pase L. Voskoboinik I. Petris M.J. O'Brien A.W. Camakaris J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1463-C1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In summary, we identify a distinct mammalian member of the family of secretory pathway pumps with novel properties that include a more limited tissue distribution, localization to TGN-derived vesicles in neuronal cells, a poorer affinity for calcium ions, and distinct phenotypic effects in yeast. Taken together, these findings indicate that hSPCA2 may have a more specialized cellular role, possibly including delivery and detoxification of Mn2+ in the TGN and endosomal compartments.

https://openalex.org/W2005583629,"Although progesterone (P4) has been implicated to offer protection against ovarian cancer (OCa), little is known of its mechanism of action. The goal of this study was to identify P4-regulated genes that have anti-OCa action. Three immortalized nontumorigenic human ovarian surface epithelial (HOSE) cell lines and three OCa (OVCA) cell lines were subjected to 5 days of P4 treatment. Transcriptional profiling with a cDNA microarray containing ≈2400 known genes was used to identify genes (1) whose expression was consistently downregulated in OVCA cell lines compared to HOSE cell lines, and (2) whose expression was restored in OCa cell lines by P4 treatment. From the candidates selected, activating transcription factor-3 (ATF-3), caveolin-1, deleted in liver cancer-1 (DLC-1), and nonmetastatic clone 23 (NM23-H2) were chosen for post hoc functional studies based on their previously reported action as tumor suppressors or apoptosis inducers. Semiquantitative RT–PCR analyses confirmed loss of or reduced transcription of these genes in OVCA cells when compared to HOSE cells and their upregulation following P4 treatment. Hormonal specificity was demonstrated by blockade experiments with a progestin antagonist RU 38486. Ectopic expression of caveolin-1, DLC-1, and NM23-H2 caused growth inhibition in OVCA cell cultures, but not in HOSE cell cultures, while forced expression of ATF-3 suppressed growth in both. Overexpression of AFT-3 also enhanced caspase-3 activity in both HOSE and OVCA cells, whereas ectopic expression of caveolin-1 and DLC-1 only activated this enzyme in OCa cells. In contrast, NM23-H2 overexpression was ineffective in activating caspase-3. Overexpression of any of the four genes in OCa cells reduced soft-agar colony formation and cell invasiveness. Taken together, we have identified four new P4-regulated, antitumor genes for OCa. However, their modes of action differ significantly; ATF-3 primarily functions as an apoptosis inducer, NM23-H2 as a suppressor of cell motility, and caveolin-1 and DLC-1 exhibiting features of classical tumor suppressors. To the best of our knowledge, except for NM23-H2, this is the first report linking P4 to the regulation of these tumor suppressor/proapoptotic genes, which could serve as future therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2080187842,"The cGMP-binding cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE5) contains a catalytic domain that hydrolyzes cGMP and a regulatory (R) domain that contains two GAFs (a and b; GAF is derived from the proteins mammalian cGMP-binding PDEs, Anabaena adenylyl cyclases, and Escherichia coli (FhlA)).

Results reveal that: 1) high affinity homo-dimerization occurs between GAF a modules (KD < 30 nm) and between GAF b modules (KD = 1-20 pm), and the sequence between the GAFs (Thr322-Asp403) contributes to dimer stability; 2) 176 amino acids (Val156-Gln331) in GAF a are adequate for cGMP binding; 3) GAF a has higher affinity for cGMP (KD < 40 nm) than does the isolated R domain (KD = 110 nm) or holoenzyme (KD = 200 nm), suggesting that the sequence containing GAF b and its flanking amino acids autoinhibits GAF a cGMP-binding affinity in intact R domain; 4) a mutant (Met1-Glu321) containing only GAF a has high affinity, biphasic cGMP-binding kinetics consistent with structural heterogeneity of GAF a, suggesting that the presence of GAF b is not required for biphasic cGMP-dissociation kinetics observed in holoenzyme or isolated R domain; 5) significant cGMP binding by GAF b was not detected; and 6) the sequence containing GAF b and its flanking amino acids is critical for cGMP stimulation of Ser102 phosphorylation by cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases. Results yield new insights into PDE5 functions, further define boundaries that provide for allosteric cGMP binding, and identify regions that contribute to dimerization.

All known mammalian PDEs are Class I PDEs that have been divided into 11 families based on biochemical properties, DNA sequence analyses, and pharmacological characteristics. All are chimeric proteins comprising a catalytic domain (C domain) and a regulatory domain (R domain). R domains of mammalian PDEs 2, 5, 6, 10, and 11 contain either one or two predicted homologous GAF modules of ∼120 aa (12Francis S.H. Turko I.V. Corbin J.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

GAFs are one of the largest families of protein modules and are closely related to PAS domains (found in period clock protein, aryl hydrocarbon receptor and single-minded protein). However, little is known about GAF functions or the physical features that provide for their stability and functions. GAFs are commonly described as ligand-binding domains, but such a function has been demonstrated for only a few (16Kanacher T. Schultz A. Linder J.U. Schultz J.E.

Each monomer within PDE5 R domain contains a site for phosphorylation whose solvent exposure is modulated by allosteric cGMP binding, two potential sites for allosteric cGMP binding (GAFs a and b), and a dimerization interface.

The phosphorylation increases the cGMP-binding affinity of the allosteric sites in the R domain, converts a kinetically heterogeneous population of binding sites to a single kinetic species, and concomitantly increases catalytic activity.

Therefore, regulation of the autoinhibition/activation of PDE5 catalytic function by allosteric cGMP binding and/or phosphorylation involves interactions among multiple subdomains within the R domain.Much evidence supports the interpretation that the effects of allosteric cGMP binding and/or phosphorylation to stimulate PDE5 catalytic activity is critically involved in negative feedback regulation of cellular cGMP levels; the same mechanisms also participate in a feed-forward feedback process to increase potency of PDE5 inhibitors (43Corbin J.D.

However, mechanisms by which cGMP binding and phosphorylation of the R domain affect enzyme activity and the roles of individual GAFs in PDE5 are not fully understood.To date, the physical boundaries that provide for cGMP binding have only been examined for GAF b in PDE2 (52Wu A.Y.

In this report, the structural and functional features that provide for and modulate PDE5 R domain functions have been extensively defined and characterized by studying biochemical and biophysical properties of a collection of truncated mutants of recombinant His-tagged hPDE5A1; these include the holoenzyme, the full-length and an N-terminally truncated PDE5A1 R domain containing both GAFs a and b and the phosphorylation site, and mutants containing either the isolated GAF a or b alone or with their respective flanking regions. These purified proteins have been characterized for cGMP-binding properties, quaternary structures, and cGMP modulation of phosphorylation of Ser102. The results from each of these approaches establish functional features and mechanisms of regulation of PDE5 holoenzyme, expand knowledge of PDE structure-function relationships, and advance understanding of GAF domains.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of hPDE5A1 Holoenzyme and Isolated GAF Mutants—Human cDNA coding for full-length PDE5A1 (courtesy of Dr. K. Omori, Tanabe-Seiyaku Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Saitama, Japan) was used as a template to generate the His-tagged holoenzyme as well as a collection of ten His-tagged hPDE5A1 truncation mutants (mutant 1-10, depicted in Fig. 1A). All constructs were created by introduction of start and stop codons at the appropriate loci. The resulting PCR fragment for each construct was cloned into pCR 2.1-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing, then excised by digestion with EcoRI and NotI and inserted into pAcHLT-A vector (BD Pharmingen) digested with the same enzymes. pAcHLT-A vector contains a His6 sequence preceding the coding region, generating N-terminally His-tagged proteins. The boundaries for the GAF a and GAF b were selected based on homology with other GAF-containing PDEs (PDE2 and PDE6), because the precise boundaries of these functional modules were not known. Mutants included: the full-length R domain (mutant 1: Met1-Glu539), an N-terminally truncated R domain containing both GAFs a and b and the phosphorylation site (mutant 2: Val46-Glu539), a collection of constructs that contain the isolated GAF a and varying lengths of its respective flanking regions (mutant 3: Met1-Asp403; mutant 4: Met1-Glu321; mutant 5: Val46-Asp403; mutant 6: Val156-Gln331; and mutant 7: Val156-Asp403), an isolated GAF b construct containing the flanking regions on either side (mutant 8: Thr322-Glu539), and two constructs containing the GAF b conjoined with the C domain with (mutant 10: Thr322-Asn875) or without (mutant 9: Glu420-Asn875) the intervening sequence between GAFs a and b. Due to a low level of phosphate incorporation into Thr50 (-Arg-Lys-Ala-Thr50-), which is located near the His tag PDE5A1 junction in mutants 2 and 5, Thr50 was mutated to alanine in these mutants using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and primer sets 5′-GAAAAGCCGCCAGAGAAATGGTCAATG-3′ and 5′-CATTGACCATTTCTGGCGGCTTTTC-3′.The following pairs of oligonucleotides containing EcoRI (underlined) and NotI (italics) sites and a stop codon (boldface type) were used to generate the hPDE5A1 constructs: Met1f: 5′-GATATTGAATTCATGGAGCGGGCCGGCCCCAGCT-3′ and Glu539r: 5′-GATGATAGCGGCCGCCTACTCTCTTGTTTCTTCCTCTGCT-3′, for mutant 1; Val46f: 5′-GACATCGAATTCGTTAGAAAAGCCGCCAGAGAAATGGT-3′ and Gl-u539r, for mutant 2; Met1f and Asp403r: 5′-GTAGATAGCGGCCGCC-TAATCATGTTCCCTTGTTAATGTATC-3′, for mutant 3; Met1f and Gl-u321r: 5′-GTAGATAGCGGCCGCCTACTCATAGAGCTGAGCATTATG, for mutant 4; Val46f and Asp403r for mutant 5; Val156f: 5′-GACATCGAATTCGTGAAGGATATTTCTAGTCA-3′ and Gln331r: 5′-GTAGATAGCGGCCGCCTACTGATTTCTCTTGTTCTC-3′ for mutant 6; Val156f and Asp403r for mutant 7; Thr322f, 5′-GACATCGAATTCACTTCACTGCTGGAGAACAAGAGA-3′ and Glu539r for mutant 8; Glu-420f: 5′-GACATCGAATTCGAACCACTTAATATCCCAG-3′ and Stop875r: 5′-GTGGACAGCGGCCGCTCAGTTCCGCTTGGCCTGG-3′, for mutant 9; Thr322f and Stop875r for mutant 10, and Met1f and Stop875r for hPDE5A1 holoenzyme. An external PKA phosphorylation site (Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Val-Val), which was introduced by the baculovirus expression vector (pAcHLT-A), was removed by mutation of the Ser residue of this site to alanine in hPDE5 holoenzyme, mutant 1 (GAF a/b) and mutant 4 (GAF a) using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and primer sets 5′-GAAGGAGAAGGGCCGCTGTTGCGGCGGGAATT-3′ and 5′-AATTCCCGCCGCAACAGCGGCCCTTCTCCTTC-3′.Expression of Wild Type and Mutant hPDE5A1 GAF Constructs—Sf9 cells (BD Pharmingen) were cotransfected with BaculoGold linear baculovirus DNA (BD Pharmingen) and one of the hPDE5A1 constructs in the pAcHLT-A baculovirus expression vector by the calcium phosphate method according to the protocol from BD Pharmingen. At 5 days post-infection, the cotransfection supernatant was collected, amplified three times in Sf9 cells, and then used directly as virus stock for expression without additional purification of recombinant viruses. Sf9 cells grown at 27 °C in complete Grace's insect medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma) in T-175 flasks (Corning) were typically infected with 10-100 μl of viral stock/flask. The optimum volume of viral stock used per T-175 flask was experimentally determined for each construct. The Sf9 cell pellet was harvested at 72-96 h post-infection.Purification of hPDE5A1 Holoenzyme and GAF Constructs—The Sf9 cell pellet for each T-175 flask (∼2 × 107 cells) was resuspended in 3 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl), containing protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at the amount per volume recommended by the manufacturer. Cell suspension was homogenized in 10- to 20-ml aliquots on ice by 2 × 6-s bursts in an Ultra Turrex microhomogenizer (Tekmar) with a 20-s recovery between bursts and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm in a Beckman JA-20 rotor for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid magnetic agarose (Qiagen) column (1 × 2 cm) equilibrated with lysis buffer. The supernatant volume varied depending on the number of T-175 flasks infected. The column was washed with 100 ml of lysis buffer followed by sequential washes with lysis buffer containing a stepwise gradient of imidazole from 0.8 to 20 mm. Lysis buffer containing 100 mm imidazole was then allowed to soak into the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. The column was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C before ten 1-ml elutions were collected. Elutions containing proteins were pooled and dialyzed versus 2000 volumes of ice-cold 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, and 25 mm β-mercaptoethanol (KPEM). All purification steps were done at 4 °C, and proteins were flash-frozen in KPEM plus 150 mm NaCl and 10% sucrose and stored at -70 °C. Prior to use in cGMP binding and phosphorylation assays, proteins were dialyzed versus 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl.Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot of hPDE5A1 Constructs—The purity and integrity of proteins were assessed using SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot or Coomassie Blue staining. Proteins were boiled for 4 min in the presence of 10% SDS, 2 m β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue and subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and then visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or Western blot. For Western blot, gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Primary antibody was a rabbit polyclonal anti-PDE5, and secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit horse-radish peroxidase (BioSource International). The blot was developed using ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). For native gel electrophoresis (no SDS), two protocols were used. For studies of PDE5 holoenzyme, isolated GAF a and isolated GAF b constructs, protein samples were combined with sample buffer and loaded into wells of pre-cast 7.5% Tris-HCl acrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). Electrophoresis was performed in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine running buffer, pH 8.3, and electrophoresis proceeded for 40 min at constant voltage (250 V) at room temperature according to the manufacturer's instructions. For studies of GAF b, the native gel was prepared as described previously (45Francis S.H. Chu D.M. Thomas M.K. Beasley A. Grimes K. Busch J.L. Turko I.V. Haik T.L. Corbin J.D. Methods. 1998; 14: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of 1 mm cGMP in the gel and running buffer, and electrophoresis was conducted at constant voltage (50 V) at 4 °C for 24 h. In all instances, bovine serum albumin standard for native gels (Sigma) was run alongside to serve as markers. In experiments utilizing [32P]ATP for phosphorylation of PDE5 constructs, the dye front was run into the lower buffer to remove [32P]ATP prior to staining and autoradiography. Proteins were visualized with Coomassie Blue or silver stain.Determination of Stokes Radius—Purified proteins (∼5-70 μg) were combined with two internal standards, catalase (2 mg) and cytochrome c (2 mg), in a volume of 280 μl and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column (0.9 × 35 cm) equilibrated in KPEM and 150 mm NaCl at 4 °C. The column was eluted with the same buffer, and fractions (0.5 ml) were collected. To determine the elution position of the protein, 15 μl of each fraction was applied to a 12% gel for SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (mutant 8) or Western blotting of fractions with a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed toward PDE5 (mutants 1-5) or mouse monoclonal antibody directed toward His tag (mutants 7 and 8) (Amersham Biosciences). The second antibody was goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse horseradish-peroxidase (BioSource International). Membranes were incubated with ECL reagents and then exposed to x-ray film for 2-10 s, conditions under which each exposure to the film does not reach saturation. Resultant films were scanned and quantified using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging, Media, PA). The quantified protein bands were plotted using the intensity of the band in the peak fraction as 100% and quantifying the amount of the protein in surrounding fractions as a percentage of that in the peak tube. Elution positions for those proteins containing the C domain (mutants 9 and 10) were determined using the PDE assay. Catalase and cytochrome c were located by absorbance at 280 nm. The column was standardized with protein standards of known Stokes radii: cytochrome c (16.6 Å), PKA C subunit (27 Å), ovalbumin (29 Å), bovine serum albumin (35 Å), PKGI-α (50 Å), and catalase (52 Å). The thyroglobulin elution volume was taken as the void volume. Elution positions of the protein standards were used to generate a standard curve of (-log Kav)1/2 versus Stokes radius as in Equation 1.Kav=elution volume−void volumeinclusion volume−void volume(Eq. 1) The Stokes radius of each protein (Table I) was determined from the standard curve based on elution volumes.Table IPhysical characteristics of PDE5A1 R domain mutantshPDE5A1 mutants (residues)Predicted MrStokes radiusSedimentation coefficientCalculated MrAssigned quaternary structurekDaÅSkDaMutant 1: GAF a/b (Met1-Glu539)63.555.1 ± 2.2 (n = 3)5.5 ± 0.1 (n = 3)125DimerMutant 2: GAF a/b (Val46-Glu539)58.352.0 ± 1.0 (n = 3)6.1 ± 0.2 (n = 3)131DimerMutant 3: GAF a (Met1-Asp403)aThe concentration of the protein in these determinations was ∼30 nm.48.559.8 ± 2.7 (n = 2)4.3 ± 0.1 (n = 3)106DimerMutant 4: GAF a (Met1-Glu321)aThe concentration of the protein in these determinations was ∼30 nm.39.648.3 ± 1"
https://openalex.org/W2137819560,"PTEN/MMAC1/TEP1: (hereafter PTEN) is a tumor suppressor gene (located at 10q23) that is frequently mutated or deleted in sporadic human tumors. PTEN encodes a multifunctional phosphatase, which negatively regulates cell growth, migration and survival via the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/AKT signalling pathway. Accordingly, Pten+/- mice develop various types of tumors including teratocarcinomas and teratomas. We have investigated PTEN expression in 60 bioptic specimens of germ cell tumors (32 seminomas, 22 embryonal carcinomas and six teratomas) and 22 intratubular germ cell neoplasias (ITGCN) adjacent to the tumors for PTEN protein and mRNA expression. In total, 10 testicular biopsies were used as controls. In the testis, PTEN was abundantly expressed in germ cells whereas it was virtually absent from 56% of seminomas as well as from 86% of embryonal carcinomas and virtually all teratomas. On the contrary, ITGCN intensely expressed PTEN, indicating that loss of PTEN expression is not an early event in testicular tumor development. The loss of PTEN expression occurs mainly at the RNA level as determined by in situ hybridization of cellular mRNA (17/22) but also it may involve some kind of post-transcriptional mechanisms in the remaining 25% of cases. Analysis of microsatellites D10S551, D10S541 and D10S1765 in GCTs (n=22) showed LOH at the PTEN locus at 10q23 in at least 36% of GCTs (three embryonal carcinoma, three seminoma, two teratoma); one seminoma and one embryonal (9%) carcinoma presented an inactivating mutation in the PTEN gene (2/22). Finally, we demonstrated that the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/AKT pathway, which is regulated by the PTEN phosphatase, is crucial in regulating the proliferation of the NT2/D1 embryonal carcinoma cells, and that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(kip1) is a key downstream target of this pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2133297652,"OGG-1 DNA glycosylase (OGG-1) is an enzyme involved in DNA repair. It excises 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine, which is formed by oxidative damage of guanine. We have investigated the role of OGG-1 in inflammation using three models of inflammation: endotoxic shock, diabetes, and contact hypersensitivity. We found that OGG-1(-/-) mice are resistant to endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS)-induced organ dysfunction, neutrophil infiltration and oxidative stress, when compared with the response seen in wild-type controls (OGG(+/+)). Furthermore, the deletion of the OGG-1 gene was associated with decreased serum cytokine and chemokine levels and prolonged survival after LPS treatment. Type I diabetes was induced by multiple low-dose streptozotocin treatment. OGG-1(-/-) mice were found to have significantly lower blood glucose levels and incidence of diabetes as compared with OGG-1(+/+) mice. Biochemical analysis of the pancreas showed that OGG-1(-/-) mice had greater insulin content, indicative of a greater beta-cell mass coupled with lower levels of the chemokine MIP-1alpha and Th1 cytokines IL-12 and TNF-alpha. Levels of protective Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-10 were significantly higher in the pancreata of OGG-1(-/-) mice as compared with the levels measured in wild-type mice. In the contact hypersensitivity induced by oxazolone, the OGG-1(-/-) mice showed reduced neutrophil accumulation, chemokine, and Th1 and Th2 cytokine levels in the ear tissue. The current studies unveil a role for OGG-1 in the regulation of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2144023048,"Most cancer therapeutics fails to eradicate cancer because cancer cells rapidly develop resistance to its proapoptotic effects. The underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here we show that three representative apoptotic stimuli, that is, serum starvation, a mitochondrial toxin, and a DNA-damaging agent (etoposide), rapidly induce several distinct classes of prosurvival molecules, in particular, Bcl-2/Bcl-XL and superoxide dismutase (SOD; including both MnSOD and Cu/ZnSOD). At the population level, the induction of these prosurvival molecules occurs prior to or concomitant with the induction of proapoptotic molecules such as Bim and Bak. Blocking the induction using siRNAs of the prosurvival or proapoptotic molecules facilitates or inhibits apoptosis, respectively. One master transcription factor, FOXO3a, is involved in the transcriptional activation of some of these prosurvival (e.g., MnSOD) and proapoptotic (e.g., Bim) molecules. Interestingly, in all three apoptotic systems, FOXO3a itself is also upregulated at the transcriptional level. Mechanistic studies indicate that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are rapidly induced upon apoptotic stimulation and that ROS inhibitors/scavengers block the induction of FOXO3a, MnSOD, and Bim. Finally, we show that apoptotic stimuli also upregulate prosurvival molecules in normal diploid human fibroblasts and at subapoptotic concentrations. Taken together, these results suggest that various apoptotic inducers may rapidly mobilize prosurvival mechanisms through ROS-activated master transcription factors such as FOXO3a. The results imply that effective anticancer therapeutics may need to combine both apoptosis-inducing and survival-suppressing strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2055424385,"During fibrosis the hepatic stellate cell (HSC) undergoes a complex activation process characterized by increased proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition. The 70-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K) is activated by mitogens, growth factors, and hormones in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent manner. p70S6K regulates protein synthesis, proliferation, and cell cycle control. Because these processes are involved in HSC activation, we investigated the role of p70S6K in HSC proliferation, cell cycle control, and type I collagen expression. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulated p70S6K phosphorylation, which was blocked by LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Rapamycin blocked phosphorylation of p70S6K but had no affect on PDGF-induced Akt phosphorylation, positioning p70S6K downstream of Akt. Transforming growth factor-β, which inhibits HSC proliferation, did not affect PDGF-induced p70S6K phosphorylation. Rapamycin treatment did not affect α1(I) collagen mRNA but reduced type I collagen protein secretion. Expression of smooth muscle α-actin was not affected by rapamycin treatment, indicating that HSC activation was not altered. Rapamycin inhibited serum-induced DNA synthesis ∼2-fold. Moreover, rapamycin decreased expression of cyclins D1, D3, and E but not cyclin D2, Rb-Ser780, and Rb-Ser795.

Together, p70S6K plays a crucial role in HSC proliferation, collagen expression, and cell cycle control, thus representing a potential therapeutic target for liver fibrosis. Hepatic fibrosis is a pathologic response of the liver to acute and chronic insults such as ethanol, viral infection, cholestasis, and metabolic diseases (1.Friedman S.L. Schiff E. Sorrell M. Maddrey W. Diseases of the Liver. 8th Ed. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1998: 371-386Google Scholar). Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) 1The abbreviations used are: HSC, hepatic stellate cell; α-SMA, smooth muscle α-actin; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; FACS, fluorescent-activated cell sorting; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; p70S6K, p70 S6 kinase; Rb, retinoblastoma. play a crucial role in liver fibrosis, as they are responsible for excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, of which type I collagen predominates (2.Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2247-2250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar). After a fibrogenic stimulus, HSCs transform from a quiescent vitamin A storing cell to an activated myofibroblast-like cell (2.Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2247-2250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar). Morphological changes associated with HSC activation include a loss of vitamin A stores and appearance of the cytoskeletal protein smooth muscle α-actin (α-SMA) (3.Mak K.M. Leo M.A. Lieber C.S. Gastroenterology. 1984; 87: 188-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 4.Ramadori G. Veit T. Schwogler S. Dienes H.P. Knittel T. Rieder H. Meyer zum Buschenfelde K.H. Virchows Arch. B Cell Pathol. Incl. Mol. Pathol. 1990; 59: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Two major events occur after HSC activation that substantially contribute to their active role in liver fibrosis. First, they are the primary cell type responsible for increased synthesis and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins in the liver (5.Takahara T. Kojima T. Miyabayashi C. Inoue K. Sasaki H. Muragaki Y. Ooshima A. Lab. Investig. 1988; 59: 509-521PubMed Google Scholar). Second, activated HSCs proliferate thereby effectively increasing the population of fibrogenic cells and amplifying the fibrotic response (6.Geerts A. Lazou J.M. De Bleser P. Wisse E. Hepatology. 1991; 13: 1193-1202PubMed Google Scholar). The most potent mitogenic factor for HSCs is platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (7.Pinzani M. Gesualdo L. Sabbah G.M. Abboud H.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1989; 84: 1786-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Multiple signaling pathways are implicated in HSC proliferation. Activation of Ras due to PDGF is followed by sequential activation of Raf, MEK, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (8.Pinzani M. Marra F. Semin. Liver Dis. 2001; 21: 397-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Blocking extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity after PDGF stimulation inhibits HSC proliferation (9.Marra F. Arrighi M.C. Fazi M. Caligiuri A. Pinzani M. Romanelli R.G. Efsen E. Laffi G. Gentilini P. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 951-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Stress-activated kinases also regulate HSC proliferation. Inhibition of JNK in quiescent or culture-activated HSCs prevented increases in the cell population; however, inhibition of p38 increased HSC proliferation (10.Schnabl B. Bradham C.A. Bennett B.L. Manning A.M. Stefanovic B. Brenner D. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 953-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway is also activated after PDGF treatment of HSCs (11.Marra F. Pinzani M. DeFranco R. Laffi G. Gentilini P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12.Marra F. Gentilini A. Pinzani M. Choudhury G.G. Parola M. Herbst H. Dianzani M.U. Laffi G. Abboud H.E. Gentilini P. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 1297-1306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). After PDGF stimulation PI3K, a heterodimeric protein composed of an 85-kDa regulatory and 110-kDa catalytic subunit associates with the PDGF receptor and becomes activated by phosphorylation. PI3K activation results in the generation of phosphorylated inositol lipids, essential second messengers for intracellular signaling (13.Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 747-752PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated inositol lipid bind to Akt, a downstream target in the PI3K pathway, and induce its translocation to the plasma membrane (14.Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar). There Akt becomes activated by phosphorylation at residues Thr308 and Ser473 by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (14.Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar, 15.Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). A role of PI3K in HSC proliferation has been confirmed since inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 or wortmannin blocks HSC proliferation (12.Marra F. Gentilini A. Pinzani M. Choudhury G.G. Parola M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 8083-8090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We have shown that serum or PDGF activates Akt in HSCs by phosphorylating Ser473. Inhibition of PI3K blocks this activity. In addition, inhibiting both PI3K and Akt blocks HSC proliferation and type I collagen synthesis (17.Reif S. Lang A. Lindquist J.N. Gäbele E. Scanga A. Brenner D.A. Rippe R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8083-8090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Another downstream target in the PI3K pathway, via Akt, is p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K), a ribosomal 70-kDa protein that is activated by mitogens, growth factors, and several hormones (18.Berven L.A. Crouch M.F. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2000; 78: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is a key regulator of mRNA translation and protein synthesis and is required for cell cycle progression, cell differentiation, and cell growth. Activation of p70S6K occurs through a complex series of phosphorylation events on several serine or threonine residues (19.Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these sites is inhibited by wortmannin, LY294002, rapamycin, and by amino acid deprivation (20.Pullen N. Thomas G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 21.Jefferies H.B. Fumagalli S. Dennis P.B. Reinhard C. Pearson R.B. Thomas G.

Rapamycin, a lipophilic bacterial macrolide with immunosuppressive properties, inhibits proliferation of yeast and several mammalian cell types including B and T lymphocytes (8.Pinzani M. Marra F. Semin. Liver Dis. 2001; 21: 397-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 23.Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). In HSCs, rapamycin effectively blocked insulin-like growth factor-induced DNA synthesis (24.Skrtic S. Wallenius K. Gressner A.M. Jansson J.O. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5729-5735Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, rapamycin blocked extracellular matrix deposition in CCl4-induced liver fibrosis (25.Zhu J. Wu J. Frizell E. Liu S.L. Bashey R. Rubin R. Norton P. Zern M.A. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 1198-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Yet, the molecular mechanism has not been clarified. Here we report that rapamycin treatment of HSCs inhibits phosphorylation of p70S6K, leading to an inhibition of type I collagen synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell cycle progression. HSC Isolation and Culture—HSCs were purified from male Sprague-Dawley retired breeder rats (>400 g) as previously described (26.Rippe R.A. Almounajed G. Brenner D.A. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 241-251PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated HSCs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), standard antibiotics, and 2 mm l-glutamine in a 95% air, 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. Growth medium was exchanged every other day. HSCs were activated by culturing on plastic for 10–14 days. The purity of culture-activated HSCs was assessed by immunostaining cells using mouse anti-human smooth muscle α-actin (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). All animal procedures were performed under the guidelines set by the University of North Carolina Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and are in accordance with those set by the National Institutes of Health. Experimental Protocol—After an activation period of 10–14 days in culture, HSCs were cultured for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without FBS supplementation to synchronize the cells. After synchronization, cells were treated with 25 μm LY294002 (Calbiochem), 10 nm rapamycin (Sigma), or the vehicle Me2SO (Sigma). After 1 h, HSCs were treated with 10% FBS or 20 ng/ml PDGF-B/B (Roche Applied Science). In some of the experiments HSCs were stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNFα (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or 5 ng/ml TGFβ (R&D Systems). Western Blot Analysis—Cultured HSCs were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were lysed using protein sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol). Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Protein samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and 20 μg was applied to a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels were used for collagen analysis). After electrophoresis the proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell). Membranes were stained with 0.5% Ponceau S to assure equal protein loading. Membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% powdered nonfat dry milk in TBS-T (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 144 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Afterward, membranes were incubated with primary and secondary antibodies, each diluted in TBS-T unless specified otherwise according to Table I. After incubation with the secondary antibodies, the membranes were briefly washed twice and then 3 times for 10 min each with TBS-T. Immunodetected proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescent ECL assay kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol.Table IHRP, horseradish peroxidase.Primary antibodyDilutionaAll antibodies were diluted in 5% nonfat dry milk TBS-Tween solution unless otherwise stated./IncubationSecondary antibodyDilutionaAll antibodies were diluted in 5% nonfat dry milk TBS-Tween solution unless otherwise stated./IncubationPolyclonal rabbit anti-human phospho-p70s6 kinase (Thr421/Ser424) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY)1:1500/1 hHRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA)1:2500/30 minPolyclonal rabbit anti-p70s6 kinase (Upstate Biotechnology)1:1000/1 hHRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz)1:1000/30 minPolyclonal rabbit anti-mouse phospho-AKT (Ser473) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA)1:1000 in 5% bovine serum albumin /12 hHRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz)1:2000 in 5% bovine serum albumin/60 minPolyclonal rabbit anti-IκBα (Santa Cruz)1:1000/1 hHRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz)1:1000/1 hMonoclonal rabbit anti-rat collagen Type I (Biodesign, Saco, ME)1:1000/1 hHRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz)1:2000/1 hMouse anti-human smooth muscle α-actin (Dako)1:1000/1 hHRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz)1:1000/30 minMouse monoclonal IgG antibody against anti-human cyclin D1 (Santa Cruz)1:1000/1 hHRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz)1:1000/1 hRabbit polyclonal anti-human cyclin D2 (Santa Cruz)1:400/10 hHRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz)1:400/1 hRabbit polyclonal anti-human cyclin D3 (Santa Cruz)1:300/1 hHRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz)1:1000/1 hPolyclonal rabbit anti-human cyclin E (Upstate Biotechnology)1:1000/6 hHRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz)1:1000/1 hRabbit polyclonal anti-human phospho-Rb Ser780 (Cell Signaling)1:1000/2 hHRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz)1:1000/1 hRabbit polyclonal anti-human phospho-Rb Ser 795 (Cell Signaling)1:1000/2 hHRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA)1:1000/1 ha All antibodies were diluted in 5% nonfat dry milk TBS-Tween solution unless otherwise stated.

Culture-activated HSCs (7–10 days in culture) were seeded at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates in growth medium containing 10% FBS. After 24 h the medium was changed to 0.2% FBS, and the cells were incubated for another 24 h to reduce cell proliferation. One hour before the proliferative trigger cells were treated with 10 nm rapamycin (Sigma). Afterward, the cells were incubated in medium containing either 0.2 or 10% FBS for 48 h with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine present during the last 24 h. At the end of the incubation 10% trichloroacetic acid was added, and the cells were maintained on ice for 15 min. Cells were washed twice with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and solubilized in 0.2 n NaOH, and radioactivity was measured using a scintillation counter. Experiments were performed in quadruplicate. RNase Protection Assay—RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (27.Rivera C.A. Bradford B.U. Hunt K.J. Adachi Y. Schrum L.W. Koop D.R. Burchardt E.-R. Rippe R. Thurman R.G. Am.

Protected fragments were analyzed using standard 6% sequencing gels. After electrophoresis, bands were visualized by autoradiography, and signals were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescent-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) Analysis—Rat HSCs were cultured for 10 days then serum-starved for an additional 48 h. Cells were subsequently treated with 25 μm LY294002, 10 nm rapamycin, or Me2SO as a vehicle control for 1 h. Afterward, 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB was added, and the cells were incubated for 24 h. For the 48-h time point, the medium was changed after 24 h, and fresh LY294002, rapamycin, and PDGF-BB were added. Cells were harvested by scraping, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, then incubated in 2 mm EDTA in phosphatebuffered saline for 20 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and treated with 100 μg/ml RNase for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. Cell cycle state was assessed by flow cytometry using a FACScan instrument (BD Biosciences). Type I Collagen Protein Expression—Proteins from culture media were precipitated with the addition of ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 40% at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, and the pellet was suspended in 0.5 m acetic acid. Aliquots of the protein sample were digested with 130 units of pepsin (Sigma), neutralized with 1.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, and digested with 8 units of collagenase (Sigma) at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were applied on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, and Western blot analysis was performed for type I collagen as described above. Statistical Analysis—Student's t test was used for determination of statistical significance as appropriate. Statistical values of p ≤ 0.05 were considered to be significant before analysis. Data are presented as the means ± S.E. LY294002 Treatment Inhibits PDGF-induced p70S6K Phosphorylation—To determine whether p70S6K is involved in the PI3K pathway in HSCs, activated HSCs were serum-starved for 48 h and then stimulated for 10, 20, 30, and 60 min with 20 ng/ml PDGF in the presence or absence of 25 μm LY294002, a specific PI3K inhibitor. Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of LY294002 on phosphorylation of p70S6K. As shown in Fig. 1, phosphorylated p70S6K is weakly detectable before stimulation with PDGF. However, stimulation of HSCs with 20 ng/ml PDGF (Fig. 1) induced phosphorylation of p70S6K at Thr421/Ser424 after 10, 20, 30, and 60 min of treatment, whereas LY294002 completely blocked phosphorylation of p70S6K at all time points. These data demonstrate that PDGF (and serum, data not shown) stimulate phosphorylation of p70S6K and that PDGF-induced activation of p70S6K is inhibited by LY treatment. In addition, our data show that p70S6K is located downstream of PI3K in PDGF-induced cell signaling in HSCs. Rapamycin Blocks PDGF-induced Phosphorylation of p70S6K but Not Phosphorylation of Akt—Rapamycin has been shown to inhibit activation of p70S6K in several cell types (19.Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 21.Jefferies H.B. Fumagalli S. Dennis P.B. Reinhard C. Pearson R.B. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3693-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Akt, a downstream target in the PI3K pathway, is activated by PI3K, resulting in phosphorylation of residues Thr308 and Ser473 within the activation loop of Akt (14.Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar, 15.Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar, 28.Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). In HSCs we have previously shown that serum and PDGF both activate Akt by phosphorylation of Ser473, which is inhibited by treatment with LY294002 (17.Reif S. Lang A. Lindquist J.N. Gäbele E. Scanga A. Brenner D.A. Rippe R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8083-8090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of rapamycin on Akt and p70S6K phosphorylation in HSCs, culture-activated HSCs were serum-starved for 48 h followed by treatment with 10 nm rapamycin for 1 h. Cells were subsequently stimulated with 20 ng/ml PDGF. Western blot analysis demonstrated that 20 ng/ml PDGF resulted in the phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) throughout the 1-h time period (Fig. 2A). Expression of phosphorylated Akt was highest within 10 min after PDGF treatment and decreased slightly over the experimental period. No difference was found in the expression of phospho-Akt after rapamycin treatment compared with Me2SO control-treated cells. Phosphorylated p70S6K at Thr421/Ser424 was not detected before PDGF treatment (Fig. 2B); however, after 10 min of PDGF treatment an induction of p70S6K phosphorylation was observed that persisted up to 60 min after stimulation. At all time points, rapamycin completely blocked p70S6K phosphorylation. These data show that PDGF stimulates phosphorylation of p70S6K in HSCs and that p70S6K is positioned downstream of Akt in PDGF-induced signaling in the HSC. TGFβ Does Not Change Phosphorylation of p70S6K—TGFβ is one of the most important pro-fibrogenic cytokines for the HSC (2.Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2247-2250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that TGFβ inhibits HSC proliferation (29.Bachem M.G. Riess U. Gressner A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 708-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 30.Saile B. Matthes N. Knittel T. Ramadori G. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism is unknown. Because we have previously shown that the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-PI3K-Akt-signaling pathway transduces proliferative signaling in the HSC, we wanted to determine whether TGFβ inhibits FAK-PI3K-Akt signaling, leading to an inhibition of p70S6K activation. We previously showed that TGFβ fails to inhibit PDGF-induced Akt phosphorylation (17.Reif S. Lang A. Lindquist J.N. Gäbele E. Scanga A. Brenner D.A. Rippe R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8083-8090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). HSCs were treated with 5 ng/ml TGFβ alone 1 h before a 20 ng/ml PDGF stimulation simultaneously with a 20 ng/ml PDGF stimulation or 10 min after a 20 ng/ml PDGF stimulation, and the cells were harvested and assessed for p70S6K phosphorylation. TGFβ alone did not induce p70S6K phosphorylation (Fig. 3, second lane from left); however, as demonstrated above, PDGF stimulation induced p70S6K phosphorylation (Fig. 3, third lane). The addition of TGFβ 1 h before (Fig. 3, fourth lane), at the same time (Fig. 3, fifth lane), or 10 min after stimulation with PDGF (Fig. 3, sixth lane) did not alter p70S6K phosphorylation. These data indicate that TGFβ does not inhibit HSC proliferation via the p70S6K signaling pathway in HSCs. TNFα Does Not Induce Phosphorylation of p70S6K in HSCs— TNFα has been reported to activate PI3K signaling in several cell types (31.Hanna A.N. Chan E.Y. Xu J. Stone J.C. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12722-12729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to evaluate the effect of TNFα on p70S6K activation in activated HSCs. HSCs were serum-starved in 0% serum for 48 h then treated with 10 ng/ml TNFα for 10, 20, 30, and 60 min or 20 ng/ml PDGF for 10, 20, and 30 min, which served as a control for p70S6K phosphorylation. As expected, PDGF lead to phosphorylation of p70S6K at all time points (Fig. 4, first through third lanes). In contrast, phosphorylated p70S6K was not detected after TNFα stimulation (Fig. 4, fifth through eighth lanes). Degradation of IκBα served as a control for TNFα activity. IκBα protein was detected at 0 and 10 min after TNFα stimulation; however, after 20 and 30 min following TNFα treatment, degradation of IκBα was noted. IκBα expression was again detected after 60 min of TNFα treatment. This transient degradation of IκBα is a typical response to TNFα treatment previously shown in HSCs (32.Hellerbrand C. Jobin C. Licato L.L. Sartor R.B. Brenner D.A. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 1998; 275: 269-278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these results demonstrate that TNFα does not stimulate p70S6K activity in activated HSCs. Inhibiting p70S6K Kinase Does Not Attenuate α1(I) Collagen mRNA Expression but Does Decrease Type I Collagen Protein Expression—Because HSCs are the major source of collagen during hepatic fibrogenesis, we investigated the influence of p70S6K on α1(I) collagen mRNA and type I collagen protein levels. We have previously shown that inhibition of PI3K decreases α1(I) collagen mRNA and type I collagen protein secretion from culture-activated HSCs (17.Reif S. Lang A. Lindquist J.N. Gäbele E. Scanga A. Brenner D.A. Rippe R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8083-8090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). HSCs were cultured on plastic, and after 10 days in culture the cells were treated with Me2SO or 10 nm rapamycin for up to 72 h, with fresh media and treatments replaced every 24 h. Inhibiting p70S6K activity with rapamycin did not significantly attenuate α1(I) collagen mRNA expression (Fig. 5). To assess the effects of blocking PI3K or p70S6K activity on type I collagen production, Western blot analysis was performed for type I collagen from cultured media. Treatment of the cells with 25 μm LY294002 significantly reduced type I collagen protein levels within 48 and 72 h compared with control Me2SO-treated cells (Fig. 6A). Treatment of the cells with 10 nm rapamycin also inhibited extracellular type I collagen protein expression although not to the extent that was observed in the LY294002-treated cells (Fig. 6A). HSC cellular extracts were also examined for intracellular type I collagen protein levels after treatment with Me2SO, 25 μm LY294002, or 10 nm rapamycin. LY294002 treatment significantly reduced type I collagen intracellular protein levels both at days 3 and 7 compared with control values (Fig. 6B). Moreover, rapamycin similarly blunted collagen I protein expression (Fig. 6C). To determine whether p70S6K is required for activation of HSCs in culture, HSCs were cultured and treated with 10 nm rapamycin or Me2SO as a control. Western blot analysis showed that there is no significant difference in the level of α-SMA expression between HSCs treated with Me2SO or rapamycin at day 3 or 7, indicating p70S6K is not required for activation of HSCs (Fig. 6D). Inhibition of p70S6K Decreases the Relative Proliferation Rate in HSCs—We have previously shown that inhibition of PI3K or Akt attenuates HSC proliferation (17.Reif S. Lang A. Lindquist J.N. Gäbele E. Scanga A. Brenner D.A. Rippe R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8083-8090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). To investigate whether inhibition of p70S6K pathway would prevent HSC proliferation, [3H]thymidine incorporation was assessed to measure DNA synthesis, a classical indicator of cell proliferation, 10–14 days after isolation. After a 24-h period of serum starvation, DNA synthesis of HSCs was stimulated using 10% FBS. We have shown a similar induction of cell proliferation when either serum or 20 mg/ml PDGF is used as a proliferative stimulus (data not shown). Before adding the proliferative stimulus, cells were treated with 10 nm rapamycin for 1 h. After stimulation with 10% serum, the relative proliferation rate was increased 2.5-fold compared with cells treated with 0.2% serum (Fig. 7). In contrast, HSCs stimulated with 10% serum and pretreated with 10 nm rapamycin showed a significant reduction in the proliferative rate compared with HSCs"

https://openalex.org/W2026741321,"The specificity of sperm-egg recognition in mammals is mediated primarily by the zona pellucida surrounding ovulated eggs. Mouse sperm are quite promiscuous and bind to human eggs, but human spermatozoa will not bind to mouse eggs. The mouse zona pellucida contains three glycoproteins, ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3, which are conserved in rat and human. The recent observation that human zonae pellucidae contain a fourth protein raises the possibility that the presence of four zona proteins will support human sperm binding. Using mass spectrometry, four proteins that are similar in size and share 62–70% amino acid identity with human ZP1, ZP2, ZP3, and ZP4/ZPB were detected in rat zonae pellucidae. However, although mouse and rat spermatozoa bind to eggs from each rodent, human sperm bind to neither, and the presence of human follicular fluid did not alter the specificity of sperm binding. In addition, mutant mouse eggs lacking hybrid/complex N-glycans or deficient in Core 2 O-glycans were no more able to support human sperm binding than normal mouse eggs. These data suggest that the presence of four zona proteins are not sufficient to support human sperm binding to rodent eggs and that additional determinants must be responsible for taxon-specific fertilization among mammals. The specificity of sperm-egg recognition in mammals is mediated primarily by the zona pellucida surrounding ovulated eggs.

These data suggest that the presence of four zona proteins are not sufficient to support human sperm binding to rodent eggs and that additional determinants must be responsible for taxon-specific fertilization among mammals. After passage through the lower female reproductive tract, mammalian spermatozoa fertilize ovulated eggs in the ampulla of the oviduct. A key event in successful fertilization is sperm binding to the surface of the extracellular zona pellucida that surrounds the egg. Following zona penetration and fusion with the egg plasma membrane, peripherally located cortical granules within the egg exocytose their contents, which modify the zona matrix such that sperm no longer bind. These events are carefully orchestrated to ensure that a single sperm fertilizes a single egg (1.Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neil J. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, New York1994: 189-317Google Scholar). Despite decades of investigation, the molecular basis of mammalian sperm-egg recognition remains controversial. Human sperm are particularly fastidious and bind to old world primate eggs but not to eggs of other species. In contrast, mouse sperm are quite promiscuous, binding with near universality to eggs from other mammalian orders (2.Bedford J.M. Anat. Rec. 1977; 188: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The mouse zona pellucida is composed of three major glycoproteins, ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3, one of which, ZP2, is proteolytically cleaved following fertilization (3.Wassarman P.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 415-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Mouse lines have been established that lack each of the zona proteins as well as lines in which human ZP2 and/or human ZP3 replace endogenous mouse proteins (4.Hoodbhoy T. Dean J. Reproduction. 2004; 127: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Mice without ZP1 form a zona pellucida matrix to which mouse sperm bind and Zp1 null females are fertile, albeit with decreased fecundity (5.Rankin T. Talbot P. Lee E. Dean J. Development. 1999; 126: 3847-3855PubMed Google Scholar). Mice in which endogenous proteins are replaced with human ZP2, human ZP3, or both are also fertile but do not support human sperm binding (6.Rankin T.L. Tong Z.-B. Castle P.E. Lee E. Gore-Langton R. Nelson L.M. Dean J. Development. 1998; 125: 2415-2424PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Rankin T.L. Coleman J.S. Epifano O. Hoodbhoy T. Turner S.G. Castle P.E. Lee E. Gore-Langton R. Dean J. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, mouse ZP1 is not required for sperm-egg recognition, and human ZP2 and ZP3 are not sufficient to support human sperm binding. These results suggest that “humanized” zona matrices either lack a factor or contain a factor that prevents the binding of human sperm. Several possibilities can be entertained: 1) human sperm binding requires post-translational modification(s) of ZP2 and ZP3 by glycosylation pathways peculiar to human oocytes (8.Dell A. Chalabi S. Easton R.L. Haslam S.M. Sutton-Smith M. Patankar M.S. Lattanzio F. Panico M. Morris H.R. Clark G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15631-15636Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); 2) conversely, post-translational glycosylation(s) of ZP2 and ZP3 (either mouse or human) by mouse oocytes actively prevents human sperm binding; 3) additional components not provided in the mouse zona matrix are required to support human sperm binding (9.Lefièvre L. Conner S.J. Salpekar A. Olufowobi O. Ashton P. Pavlovic B. Lenton W. Afnan M. Brewis I.A. Monk M. Hughes D.C. Barratt C.L.R. Hum. Reprod. 2004; 19: 1580-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar); or 4) supramolecular architecture involving more than one determinant plays a critical role (10.Dean J. Bioessays. 2004; 26: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). During intracellular processing in growing oocytes, both N- and O-glycans are added to the zona pellucida proteins prior to their secretion. N-Glycans are preassembled as a dolichol-linked high mannose oligosaccharide and cotranslationally attached to canonical sites (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr; where Xaa is any amino acid except proline). Subsequent modifications by glycosyltransferases and glycosidases result in hybrid and complex N-glycans. This progression beyond the initial multiantennary high mannose structures requires N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GlcNAcT I) 1The abbreviations used are: GlcNAcT, β1–6 N-acetylhexosaminehexose; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; CID, collision-induced dissociation; MgatI, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I; C2, Core 2. encoded by MgatI (11.Kumar R. Yang J. Larsen R.D. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9948-9952Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Of the 16 potential N-glycosylation sites on mouse ZP1 (four), ZP2 (six), and ZP3 (six), only one (ZP3-Asn227) remains free of glycan (12.Boja E.S. Hoodbhoy T. Fales H.M. Dean J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34189-34202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and the remainder are high mannose or biantennary complex N-glycans (13.Easton R.L. Patankar M.S. Lattanzio F.A. Leaven T.H. Morris H.R. Clark G.F. Dell A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7731-7742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Mucin O-glycans are formed by the sequential addition of sugars on either serine or threonine residues after the initial folding of the protein during intracellular processing. Presumably peptide sequences or three-dimensional structures of the folded protein dictate those residues that will be modified, but the governing rules remain obscure. Mucin O-glycans initiate with the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine to serine or threonine followed by subsequent elongation by a distinct glycosyltransferase. Core 2 O-glycans are generated by the action of a Core 2 (C2) β1–6 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GlcNAcT), of which there are three isoforms (I–III) (14.Bierhuizen M.F. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Albeit widely proposed, recent biochemical and genetic studies have not substantiated a role for a specific sugar or class of glycans as the sole mediators of sperm binding. In extant glycan recognition models, the inability of sperm to bind to the early embryo has been attributed to the release from cortical granules of glycosidases that remove terminal glycans following fertilization. However, the persistence of sperm binding to the zona pellucida despite cortical granule exocytosis in genetically altered mice in which ZP2 is not cleaved is not consistent with either N- or O-glycans acting as primary “sperm receptors” and then being clipped off (7.Rankin T.L.

Of note, cleavage of ZP2 could alter the architecture of the zona matrix and mask the accessibility of specific glycans after fertilization rather than releasing them. However, mice with mutations of specific glycan attachment sites (19.Liu C. Litscher S. Wassarman P.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) or lacking an oocyte glycosyltransferases required for specific sugars proposed as recognition determinants (20.Thall A.D. Maly P.

Thus, the unequivocal identification of a particular glycan as the mediator of sperm-egg recognition has not been achieved to date. Initially, three glycoproteins were detected in the human zona pellucida (27.Shabanowitz R.B. O'Rand M.G. J. Reprod.

More recent reports raised the possibility of an additional protein in the human zona pellucida (32.Hughes D.C. Barratt C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1447: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the existence of which has been confirmed experimentally (9.Lefièvre L. Conner S.J. Salpekar A. Olufowobi O. Ashton P.

As noted, mouse zonae pellucidae contain three glycoproteins, ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3, and their primary structures also were deduced from cDNA (33.Ringuette M.J. Chamberlin M.E. Baur A.W. Sobieski D.A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 34189-34202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Mouse and rat evolutionarily diverged only 12–24 million years ago (36.Mullins L.J. Mullins J.J. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 221Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the primary protein structures of rat ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3 are 88–92% identical to their murine homologues (37.Akatsuka K.

However, the existence of an additional zona transcript deduced from cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_172330) raised the possibility of a fourth protein in the rat zona pellucida. Here we determine the protein composition of native rat zonae pellucidae by microscale mass spectrometry and identify ZP4 as a component. We also investigate the ability of human sperm to bind to normal and mutant rodent eggs as models for gain- and loss-of-function assays. Reagents—Molecular biology grade stock salt solutions for mass spectrometric analyses were purchased from Quality Biological Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD) (MgCl2 and CaCl2); Digene (Beltsville, MD) (NaCl); and Fisher (triethanolamine). Bovine pancreatic DNase I, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture tablets, and the endoproteinases Asp-N and Glu-C were from Roche Applied Science, whereas sequencing grade modified porcine trypsin was from Promega (Madison, WI). Urea, dithiothreitol, iodoacetamide, ammonium bicarbonate, Hoechst, bovine testicular hyaluronidase, and turkey egg white trypsin inhibitor were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, and Percoll was from Amersham Biosciences. The Glyko deglycosylation kit was purchased from Prozyme Inc. (San Leandro, CA). All of the HPLC grade solvents were of the highest grade commercially available from J. T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ). EM grade paraformaldehyde was obtained from Electron Microscopy Sciences (Fort Washington, PA). Egg and embryo collection media (M2 and M16) were from Cell and Molecular Technologies Inc. (Phillipsburg, NJ). Isolation of Rat Zonae Pellucidae—Rat zonae pellucidae were isolated from ovarian homogenates on Percoll gradients as described (38.Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Dev. Biol. 1980; 76: 185-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. All glassware and plasticware were siliconized (Sigmacote; Sigma-Aldrich). Rat ovaries (4 weeks old; Sprague-Dawley) were purchased from Harlan Bioproducts for Science, Inc. (Indianapolis, IN), and extraneous tissue was mechanically removed. “Complete” TEA buffer (25 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2) was supplemented immediately before use with turkey egg white trypsin inhibitor (2 mg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.05 mm), 1 protease inhibitor mixture tablet/10 ml buffer, DNase I (11 mg/ml), and hyaluronidase (11 mg/ml). “Incomplete” TEA lacked DNase I, hyaluronidase, and protease inhibitors. The ovaries were homogenized (Dounce; 30 strokes) at a concentration of 1 ovary/ml of Complete TEA buffer in 3-ml batches. Nonidet P-40 (300 μl, 10% solution) and sodium deoxycholate (300 μl, 10% solution) in Incomplete TEA were added consecutively (30 strokes each), and the mixture was transferred to a 50-ml conical tube after passing through a 100-μm nylon mesh (BD Falcon, Bedford, MA). The homogenizer was rinsed with a volume of 100% Percoll equal to that of the ovarian homogenate, and the “rinsate” was then passed through the nylon mesh and added to the ovarian homogenate. Quick-Seal centrifuge tubes (16 × 76 mm; Beckman, Palo Alto, CA) were filled with the homogenate, 50% Percoll mix, and the volume was brought up to the capacity of the tube (∼14 ml) with 50% Percoll in Incomplete TEA. 50 μl of blue density marker beads (specific gravity, 1.018 gm/ml) (Amersham Biosciences) were added to a balance tube consisting of 50% Percoll in Incomplete TEA to identify the position of the zona band, and the tubes were heat-sealed and subjected to ultracentrifugation (50 Ti rotor at 25,000 rpm, 4 °C, 45 min). The isolated zonae in a distinct white band were removed with an 18-gauge, 1.5-inch needle attached to a 3-ml syringe and washed by rehomogenizing and rebanding (50% Percoll-Incomplete TEA, twice). Finally, the zonae were washed in Incomplete TEA (three times for 15 min) and HPLC grade water (three times for 15 min) by centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 4 °C). Isolated zonae were reconstituted in 50 μl of water and examined microscopically to estimate the number of zonae/μl prior to lyophilization and storage at –80 °C. Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Protein Digests—Each zona pellucida sample processed for mass spectrometric analysis was obtained from 1–5 rat ovaries. Zonae were denatured (8 m urea), reduced (5 mm dithiothreitol) and alkylated (0.5 m iodoacetamide), had buffer exchanged to remove excess reagents (50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.8), and de-N-glycosylated (peptide N-glycosidase) with or without de-exo-O-(sialidase A, β(1–4)-galactosidase and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase) or de-exo- and endo-O-glycosylated as described previously (12.Boja E.S. Hoodbhoy T. Fales H.M. Dean J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34189-34202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Trypsin, Asp-N, trypsin + Asp-N, and Glu-C digests of rat zonae pellucidae were analyzed on a Micromass QTOF Ultima Global (Micromass, Manchester, UK) in electrospray mode (12.Boja E.S. Hoodbhoy T. Fales H.M. Dean J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34189-34202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4–5 μl of each digest was loaded onto a Vydec C18 MS column (100 × 0.15 mm; Grace Vydec, Hesperia, CA), and chromatographic separation was performed at 1 μl/min using the following gradient: 0–5% B over 5 min; 5–40% B over 80 min; 40–95% B over 10 min; and 95% B held over 5 min (solvent A, 0.1% formic acid in water; solvent B, 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). The top three most abundant ions in the preceding MS scan (m/z 300–1990 with a threshold of >10 counts/s) were subjected to CID. Data processing was accomplished by MassLynx 4.0 and submitted to Mascot search (biospec.nih.gov). Further in-depth analysis of the MS data was performed manually. Sperm Binding Assays—Mouse eggs were obtained from normal (FVB) and genetic mutant (huZP3 rescue (6.Rankin T.L. Tong Z.-B. Castle P.E. Lee E. Gore-Langton R. Nelson L.M. Dean J.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 881-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Rat eggs were obtained from Fisher females, and sperm binding assays were carried out as previously described (6.Rankin T.L. Tong Z.-B. Castle P.E. Lee E. Gore-Langton R. Nelson L.M. Dean J. Development. 1998; 125: 2415-2424PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, superovulated eggs were obtained by injecting 4-week-old rodents with 5 (mice) or 20 (rats) international units of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin followed 46–48 h (mice) or 48–50 h (rat) later by the same amount of human chorionic gonadotropin. Unfertilized eggs were collected 15–16 h later in M2 medium supplemented with one protease inhibitor tablet/10 ml (M2+inhibitors), and the cumulus cells were removed by treatment with hyaluronidase (250 μg/ml) for 2–5 min in the same medium. Mouse and rat two-cell embryos were collected in M2 medium 40 h after human chorionic gonadotropin administration and mating (1:1) of superovulated females with males of proven fertility. Eggs (20–30/experimental group) and two-cell embryos (2–3/group) were washed once with M2+inhibitors and three times with M2 alone and transferred to a 20-μl insemination droplet of M16 pre-equilibrated under mineral oil in a 5% CO2, 37 °C incubator. Human sperm collected for research purposes only were obtained from Fairfax Cryobank (Fairfax, VA). To select for motile sperm, 1.0 ml of pre-equilibrated M16 was layered over 500 μl of human semen and sperm allowed to “swim up” (1 h, 5% CO2, 37 °C incubator). Sperm from the top 500 μl were selected for capacitation. Mouse or rat caudal sperm (6.Rankin T.L. Tong Z.-B. Castle P.E. Lee E. Gore-Langton R. Nelson L.M. Dean J. Development. 1998; 125: 2415-2424PubMed Google Scholar) or the aforementioned ejaculated human sperm were capacitated in pre-equilibrated M16 (1 h, 5% CO2/37 °C incubator) and added to the insemination droplet containing the mouse or rat eggs at a concentration of 1 × 106/ml. After 30 min of exposure to sperm, the eggs were washed with a wide bore glass pipette through a series of 5 × 50-μl droplets of M16 until no more than 2–5 sperm bound to control two-cell mouse or rat embryos as an arbitrary end point. The samples were then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and stained with Hoechst, and the sperm heads were quantified from 1-μm optical sections obtained on a 510 LSM confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Sperm binding experiments were also carried out with eggs preincubated in superfluous human follicular fluid obtained from Suburban Hospital (Bethesda, MD). These experiments were carried out using normal mouse and rat eggs, as well as mouse eggs with humanized zonae in which cognate mouse zona proteins were replaced with human ZP3 alone or both human ZP2 and ZP3 (6.Rankin T.L. Tong Z.-B. Castle P.E. Lee E. Gore-Langton R. Nelson L.M. Dean J. Development. 1998; 125: 2415-2424PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Rankin T.L. Coleman J.S. Epifano O. Hoodbhoy T. Turner S.G. Castle P.E. Lee E. Gore-Langton R. Dean J. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The eggs were incubated with 0, 50, or 100% follicular fluid for 15 min and then inseminated in M16 containing 0 or 50% follicular fluid. Sperm binding experiments were performed with human and control mouse sperm, and the eggs were washed, fixed, and stained as described above. All of the experiments were conducted in compliance with the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institutes of Health under a Division of Intramural Research, NIDDK-approved animal study protocol. Human sperm and follicular fluid were used under an National Institutes of Health Institutional Review Board-approved protocol. Conservation of ZP4 Genes—Comparing the recently reported rat genome (39.Gibbs R.A. et al.Nature. 2004; 428: 493-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar) with those of human (40.International Human Genome Sequencing ConsortiumNature. 2004; 431: 931-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3567) Google Scholar) and mouse (41.Waterston R.H. et al.Nature. 2002; 420: 520-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (5442) Google Scholar), the genetic loci of four genes potentially encoding zona pellucida proteins were identified (Fig. 1A). The genes are scattered among somatic chromosomes, but each gene is syntenic among the three species with similar exon maps for ZP1 (12 exons), ZP2 (18–19 exons), and ZP3 (8 exons). Transcripts encoding three rat, human, and mouse zona proteins have previously been characterized, and a fourth human zona transcript has been reported recently (9.Lefièvre L. Conner S.J. Salpekar A. Olufowobi O. Ashton P. Pavlovic B. Lenton W. Afnan M. Brewis I.A. Monk M. Hughes D.C. Barratt C.L.R. Hum. Reprod. 2004; 19: 1580-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Rat Zp4, human ZP4/ZPB and mouse Zp4 genes, each containing 12 exons, were detected on syntenic chromosomes 17q12.1, 1q43, and 13A1, respectively (Fig. 1A). The nucleic acid sequence within the conserved exons of rat Zp4 (Fig. 1B) is 74% identical to human and encodes a hypothetical protein of 540 amino acids. Within its 12 exons, mouse Zp4 has a potential transcript that is 88% identical to the rat gene and expressed sequence tags (e.g. Riken, BY366037) corresponding to short aberrantly spliced portions of genomic sequences present in 8-cell mouse embryos. A similar “wash through” of abundant oocyte transcripts into the early embryo has been previously observed for other mouse zona transcripts (e.g. NCBI, AU043141). However, each potential open reading frame of the hypothetical mouse ZP4 transcript contains multiple stop codons (9.Lefièvre L. Conner S.J. Salpekar A. Olufowobi O. Ashton P. Pavlovic B. Lenton W. Afnan M. Brewis I.A. Monk M. Hughes D.C. Barratt C.L.R. Hum. Reprod. 2004; 19: 1580-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and after re-examination of earlier mass spectra (12.Boja E.S. Hoodbhoy T. Fales H.M. Dean J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34189-34202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), no tryptic peptides encoding ZP4 were detected in mouse zonae pellucidae. To determine whether three or four zona proteins are present in rat, zonae pellucidae were isolated from 200 rat ovaries, deglycosylated, digested with endoproteinases, and partially characterized by microscale liquid chromatography to separate peptides for mass spectrometry analysis. As expected, native rat ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3 proteins were readily detected with 52, 82, and 91% coverage, respectively, of their secreted polypeptide backbones (complete analysis to be published elsewhere). In addition, rat ZP4 was detected with 70% coverage of its polypeptide chain (Table I). Thus, it was concluded that although individual zona proteins are well conserved with a high percentage of amino acid identity, the mouse zona pellucida contains three proteins (ZP1–3), and rat and human contain four zona proteins.Table ILC-MS and MS/MS analysis of rat ZP4 Open table in a new tab Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Rat ZP4—The N terminus of rat ZP4 is predicted at Gln29 (42.Von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar), and the mass of an Asp-N cleaved peptide appearing as the monoisotopic +2 and +3 charged ions at m/z 1184.10 and 789.72 (Fig. 2A) represents the N-terminal carbamidomethylated peptide 29QHVTELPGVLHCGLQSFQFAV49 without cyclization of Gln29. Similarly, the C terminus of ZP4 was determined after a Glu-C digest by a tetracarbamidomethylated peptide (440KQVLGGQVYLHC*SASVC*QPAG(M·Ox)PSC*TVIC*PAS RR473, where C* indicates carbamidomethylated Cys) at m/z 1264.293+ and 948.474+ (Fig. 2B). This result indicates that the C terminus ends at Arg473 preceding a dibasic motif as has been observed in mouse ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3 (12.Boja E.S. Hoodbhoy T. Fales H.M. Dean J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34189-34202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and recombinant human ZP3 (43.Zhao M. Boja E. Hoodbhoy T. Nawrocki J. Kaufman J.B. Kresge N.

The resultant core 445-amino acid ZP4 polypeptide chain (Gln29–Arg473) has a predicted molecular mass of 48,878 daltons. Rat ZP4 contains four potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr; where Xaa is not proline), and each is glycosylated in native rat zonae pellucidae. Peptide N-glycosidase F endoglycosidase releases protein-bound N-linked glycans and, by converting the involved asparagine residue to an aspartic acid, provides a signature increase in mass (0.98 Da).

Although in vitro studies have demonstrated a higher transforming activity of the long RET isoform (RET51), only the short isoform (RET9) can rescue the effects of a RET null mutation in the enteric nervous system and kidney development. The molecular basis underlying the distinct functions of the two RET isoforms is not understood. Here we demonstrated that activated RET51 associated more strongly with the ubiquitin ligase Cbl than did RET9, leading to increased ubiquitylation and faster turnover of RET51. The association of Cbl with RET was indirect and was mediated through Grb2. A constitutive complex of Grb2 and Cbl could be recruited to both receptor isoforms via docking of Shc to phosphorylated Tyr-1062 in RET. A mutant Shc protein unable to recruit the Grb2·Cbl complex decreased the turnover and prolonged the half-life of RET9, thus ascribing a previously unknown negative role to the Shc adaptor molecule. In addition, phosphorylation of Tyr-1096, which is present in RET51 but absent in RET9, endowed the longer isoform with a second route to recruit the Grb2·Cbl complex. These findings establish a mechanism for the differential down-regulation of RET9 and RET51 signaling that could explain the apparently paradoxical activities of these two RET isoforms. More generally, these results illustrate how alternative splicing can regulate the half-life and function of a growth factor receptor.

More generally, these results illustrate how alternative splicing can regulate the half-life and function of a growth factor receptor. The RET proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that plays a crucial role in the development of the neural crest and the excretory system (1.Manie S. Santoro M. Fusco A. Billaud M. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 580-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 2.Airaksinen M.S. Saarma M. Nat. Rev.

The RET protein is activated by engaging members of a family of structurally related ligands consisting of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), 1The abbreviations used are: GDNF, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor; GFRα, GDNF family receptor alpha; MEN2, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; TKB, tyrosine kinase binding; RF, ring finger; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; CHX, cycloheximide; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; SH2, Src homology 2; SH3, Src homology 3. neurturin, artemin, and persephin, in the presence of specific auxiliary receptors called GFRα1–4 (GDNF family receptor alphas). Targeted deletion of the RET gene leads to severely impaired development or complete loss of kidneys (44.Schuchardt A. D'Agati V. Larsson B.L. Costantini F. Pachnis V. Nature. 1994; 367: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar, 45.Schuchardt A. D'Agati V. Pachnis V. Costantini F. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 1919-1929PubMed Google Scholar). RET is expressed in the ureteric bud and mediates the growth and branching morphogenesis of this structure. The role of RET in neural crest development is highlighted in the establishment of the enteric nervous system. Neural crest progenitors that migrate to the foregut give rise to enteric neurons and glial cells. In the absence of RET, the rostrocaudal migration of enteric neural progenitors fails, leading to a lack of innervation of the intestinal tract posterior to the stomach (3.Natarajan D. Marcos-Gutierrez C. Pachnis V. de Graaff E. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 5151-5160PubMed Google Scholar). Survival and proliferative effects of RET signaling on progenitor cells of the enteric nervous system have also been proposed (4.Barlow A. de Graaff E. Pachnis V. Neuron. 2003; 40: 905-916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Characteristic aganglionosis of the colon in Hirschsprung disease has also been linked to inactivating mutations of RET (5.Parisi M.A. Kapur R.P. Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 2000; 12: 610-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The alternative splicing of the 3′ exons of the RET gene can give rise to three distinct protein products (6.Tahira T. Ishizaka Y. Itoh F. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 97-102PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Myers S.M. Eng C. Ponder B.A. Mulligan L.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2039-2045PubMed Google Scholar). The isoforms RET9, RET43, and RET51 have different sizes because of distinct amino acid sequences in the extreme C-terminal end but are otherwise identical in upstream sequences until residue Tyr-1062. The mRNAs for RET9 and RET51 are often co-expressed and are more predominant than the RET43 transcript. The C-terminal sequences of RET9 and RET51 proteins are also highly conserved across species, whereas RET43 is not (8.Carter M.T. Yome J.L. Marcil M.N. Martin C.A. Vanhorne J.B. Mulligan L.M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2001; 95: 169-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Matera I. De Miguel-Rodriguez M. Fernandez-Santos J.M. Santamaria G. Puliti A. Ravazzolo R. Romeo G. Galera-Davidson H. Ceccherini I. DNA Seq. 2000; 11: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Functional differences between the two predominant isoforms are just beginning to be understood, and the underlying signaling mechanisms are yet to be elucidated. The clearest functional distinction between RET9 and RET51 has so far been provided by a seminal study using mice engineered to express either one of these two major isoforms (10.de Graaff E. Srinivas S. Kilkenny C. D'Agati V. Mankoo B.S. Costantini F. Pachnis V. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2433-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Embryonic and postnatal development were normal and indistinguishable in mice monomorphic for RET9. On the other hand, mice expressing only RET51 displayed several deficits in the enteric nervous system and kidneys similar to, albeit milder than, those observed in RET null mice. Moreover, a transgene for RET9 but not RET51 was able to fully rescue the effects of a null mutation in the RET gene. It was concluded in that study that RET51 represents a hypomorphic allele of this receptor. Activating mutations in RET have been implicated in a number of neoplastic syndromes involving tissues arising from the neural crest (1.Manie S. Santoro M. Fusco A. Billaud M. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 580-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 11.Takahashi M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). These mutations fall into four categories with varying severities. Papillary thyroid carcinoma and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma affect only the thyroid gland. Multiple endocrine neoplasia types 2A and 2B (MEN2A and MEN2B) are more progressive diseases characterized with additional adrenal tumors. Oncoproteins of the RET isoforms have been reported to have different transforming activities. A constitutively active RET43 is only weakly transforming in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (12.Ishiguro Y. Iwashita T. Murakami H. Asai N. Iida K.I. Goto H. Kayakawa T. Takahashi M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3992-3998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RET51 oncoproteins on the other hand are either equally or more transforming than RET9 depending on the exact mutation and the cell context. Familial medullary thyroid carcinoma and MEN2B mutations particularly are more transforming in RET51 and can induce more neurite outgrowth in pheochromocytoma PC12 cells than the corresponding active mutants of RET9 (13.Rossel M.

This raises an apparent paradox: how can RET51 be hypomorphic during embryogenesis and yet have a higher oncogenic potential than RET9? In this study, we have described negative regulatory mechanisms by which RET isoforms differed from each other. We demonstrated the association of the ubiquitin ligase Cbl on activated complexes of RET9 and RET51. The stronger interaction of Cbl with RET51 resulted in a higher level of ubiquitylation and consequent down-regulation than with RET9. We propose that signaling mediated by RET51 is not necessarily weaker than RET9 but is perhaps attenuated more effectively.

DNA Constructs and Mutagenesis—Expression constructs for MEN2A variants of human RET9 and RET51 cDNA in pJ7μ vector were from M. Billaud (Université Claude Bernard). An HA-tagged human Cbl expression construct was obtained from Y. Yarden (Weizmann Institute). GST-Grb2 and GST-Shc constructs were from J. Bliska (State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY) and R. Bradshaw (UCLA), respectively. The HA-tagged ubiquitin expression construct was from D. Bohmann (University of Rochester). GST fusion constructs for Cbl were made by subcloning Pfu-amplified fragments in pGEX6P1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). Site-directed mutagenesis of various constructs was done using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). Cell Culture—COS cells were grown in 10% serum in DMEM plus 1 mm glutamine. MN1 cells were grown in 7.5% serum in DMEM buffered with 10 mm HEPES. Transfection was done using polyethylenimine (PEI, 25 kDa, Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, 10–15 μg of DNA/10-cm tissue culture plate was diluted in 750 μl of DMEM at room temperature. Subsequently, 50 μg of polyethylenimine was added and mixed by vortexing, and the mixture was immediately dropped onto cells. Twelve to 16 h prior to lysis, cells were deprived of serum by incubation in DMEM buffered with 10 mm HEPES supplemented with glutamine and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Ligand-dependent RET activation was induced by the addition of recombinant GDNF (R&D Systems) at 50 ng/ml. Analysis of Protein Turnover—MN1 cells were serum-starved overnight prior to stimulation. To characterize the decay of RET isoforms, cells were treated in serum-free medium with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) with or without GDNF for varying time periods. RET9 and RET51 levels were then assessed by immunoprecipitation with isoform-specific antibodies and Western blotting. Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—GST fusions of Cbl and Grb2 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 strain. Logarithmic phase cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °Cand the cell pellets lysed by sonication. Fusion proteins were affinity captured on glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences), eluted with reduced glutathione, and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Immunoprecipitation, Pull-down Assays, and Protein Immunoblots— Cultured cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1% (v/v) IGEPAL CA-630, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 10% (v/v) glycerol) and supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Bioscience). Immunoprecipitations were done overnight on pre-cleared lysates using the appropriate antibodies and protein G-Sepharose beads. GST pull-down assays were done using the appropriate GST fusion protein bait immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Immune and affinity pull-down complexes were eluted for protein gel analysis by boiling in reducing Laemmli buffer. polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were used for immobilization of gel-fractionated proteins, and Western blot detection was performed by enhanced chemifluorescence method using a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). RET51 Has a Faster Turnover and Is More Ubiquitylated than RET9 —We hypothesized that the disparate biological activities of the receptor isoforms RET9 and RET51 might correlate with different patterns of receptor down-regulation following ligand activation. This possibility was investigated in the motor neuron cell line MN1, which expresses endogenously RET9 and RET51 isoforms as well as the ligand-binding receptors GFRα1 and GFRα2 (16.Trupp M. Scott R. Whittemore S.R. Ibáñez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20885-20894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). MN1 cells were treated with GDNF for different periods of time in the presence or absence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Using isoform-specific antibodies, we selectively immunoprecipitated RET9 and RET51 and then assessed the decline of receptor protein levels in the absence of ongoing protein synthesis by Western blotting. We found that the levels of RET51 were down-regulated faster in response to ligand stimulation than those of RET9 (Fig. 1A). In three independent experiments, the half-lives of RET51 and RET9 were ∼1 and 3 h, respectively (Fig. 1B), indicating a 3-fold higher turnover for the longer RET isoform. The relative turnover of the two isoforms was comparable in the absence of GDNF (Fig. 1B). Because the targeting of proteins for recycling and degradation is initiated by the covalent conjugation of ubiquitin (17.Pickart C.M. Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar, 18.Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar), we wondered whether the faster turnover of RET51 relative to RET9 could be explained by an increased level of ubiquitylation. We examined ubiquitylation patterns of RET9 and RET51 by immunoblotting using antibodies against ubiquitin. Steady state ubiquitylation levels of the receptor isoforms were assessed in transfected MEN2A receptor variants (carrying the substitution C634R) that are constitutively active. This analysis showed that MEN2A-RET51 was more ubiquitylated than MEN2A-RET9 in transfected COS cells (Fig. 2A). We also assessed the time course of ligand-dependent ubiquitylation of the two RET isoforms in MN1 cells treated with the proteasomal inhibitor PSI. Ligand treatment stimulated ubiquitylation of both RET isoforms (Fig. 2B). However, ubiquitylation of RET51 was found to occur more rapidly and to higher levels than that of RET9 (Fig. 2B). The differential down-regulation of the two RET isoforms was at first surprising, because we expected that formation of heteromeric receptor complexes between RET9 and RET51 would result in a common fate for the two receptor variants after ligand stimulation. We therefore investigated whether RET9 and RET51 were actually associated in the same complex upon ligand binding. Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed in MN1 cells in the presence or absence of GDNF using isoform-specific antibodies. Contrary to our expectations, the two RET isoforms were not found to co-immunoprecipitate with each other (Fig. 3). In agreement with these data, neither has heterodimerization of RET9 and RET51 been observed in GDNF-stimulated sympathetic neurons (19.Tsui-Pierchala B.A. Ahrens R.C. Crowder R.J. Milbrandt J. Johnson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34618-34625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although these analyses cannot at present exclude the possibility that heteromeric complexes of RET isoforms may have been lost under the conditions used for co-immunoprecipitation, these results suggest that RET9 and RET51 may be physically segregated in the cell and form distinct signaling complexes, so that the fate of one isoform is independent of the other. Ubiquitylation of RET Is Mediated by Cbl—The 120-kDa ubiquitin protein ligase Cbl has been shown to play a crucial role in the ubiquitylation and down-regulation of a growing number of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and Src family kinases (20.Lupher Jr., M.L. Rao N. Eck M.J. Band H. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 375-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 21.Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). We were therefore interested in determining whether Cbl associated with RET. We co-transfected MEN2A variants of RET9 and RET51, or a kinase-defective mutant of RET51 (K758M), with a HA-tagged Cbl construct in COS cells. Both MEN2A-RET9 and MEN2A-RET51 but not the kinase-dead receptor mutant were found in immunoprecipitation complexes of Cbl (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, constitutively active RET51 associated more strongly with Cbl compared with RET9 (Fig. 4A), consistent with the patterns of receptor ubiquitylation of the two isoforms. The association between RET and Cbl was also observed in MN1 cells after GDNF stimulation and was accompanied by a concomitant increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that the association of Cbl with RET depends upon receptor activation and phosphorylation. We then tested whether Cbl could influence the ubiquitylation of RET. When overexpressed together with MEN2A-RET51 in COS cells, Cbl did not enhance the ubiquitylation of the receptor (Fig. 5A), possibly because of saturating amounts of Cbl in these cells. However, a RING finger mutant of Cbl (C381A) that lacks ubiquitin ligase activity and has dominant negative effects (22.Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22151-22154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) suppressed the ubiquitylation of MEN2A-RET51 (Fig. 5A). Moreover, the RING finger mutant of Cbl stabilized the levels of MEN2A-RET51 in transfected COS cells treated with CHX, making the turnover of the two isoforms indistinguishable in these cells (Fig. 5B). Together, these results demonstrate that Cbl mediates RET ubiquitylation. The preferential association of Cbl with RET51 could account for the stronger ubiquitylation and faster turnover of this receptor isoform. RET Interacts with Cbl Indirectly—Because the recruitment of Cbl was dependent on the activation of RET, we set out to identify the RET autophosphorylation sites necessary for the interaction. Different phosphorylation site mutants of RET were compared for their ability to associate with Cbl by co-immunoprecipitation. Replacement of either Tyr-1062 or Tyr-1096 but not Tyr-1015 with Phe in RET51 reduced its association with Cbl, whereas the Y1062F/Y1096F double mutant failed to interact with Cbl (Fig. 6A). In the case of RET9, which lacks Tyr-1096, replacement of Tyr-1062 with Phe was sufficient to reduce its interaction with Cbl to background levels (Fig. 6A). Although Tyr-952 in RET is found within a sequence that conforms to the consensus binding motif of the tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain of Cbl (21.Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), mutation of this residue into Phe had no effect on the interaction of RET with Cbl (data not shown). Together, these results identified a common residue present in both RET isoforms, namely Tyr-1062 and Tyr-1096 (which is only present in RET51), as important determinants for the interaction of RET with Cbl. The presence of two alternative sites in RET51, compared with only one in RET9, was in line with the ability of the longer isoform to interact more strongly with Cbl. Intriguingly, neither Tyr-1062 nor Tyr-1096 are found within known consensus sequences for Cbl binding, which suggests that the interaction between RET and Cbl was indirect. In agreement with this, recombinant full-length Cbl, produced as a fusion protein to GST, was unable to detect RET in Far Western overlay assays (data not shown). To identify the regions of Cbl that are necessary for complex formation with RET, fusions between GST and different segments of Cbl were constructed and used in GST pull-down assays (Fig. 6B). The results of these experiments indicated that MEN2A-RET51 but not the kinase-dead receptor mutant K758M associated with the C-terminal region of Cbl (Fig. 6B, Cbl-C), spanning residues 350–906, which contains the RF domain that is important for its ubiquitin ligase activity and a proline-rich domain (Fig. 6C). The N-terminal region of Cbl (Fig. 6B, Cbl-N), containing the TKB domain, did not interact with MEN2A-RET51 (Fig. 6C), which is consistent with the lack of consensus binding sites for this domain around Tyr-1062 and Tyr-1096 in RET. Similar results were observed for MEN2A-RET9 (data not shown). In contrast, ligand-stimulated EGFR interacted with both the N- and C-terminal domains of Cbl (Fig. 6D) in agreement with previous results (22.Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22151-22154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 23.Levkowitz G. Oved S. Klapper L.N. Harari D. Lavi S. Sela M. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35532-35539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Together, these data indicated that intermediate molecules docking at phosphorylated Tyr-1062 and Tyr-1096 in RET mediate recruitment of Cbl to this receptor independently of the TKB domain of Cbl. Grb2 and Shc Link Cbl to RET—The scaffold protein Shc and the adaptor Grb2 are known to bind to phosphorylated Tyr-1062 and Tyr-1096 of RET, respectively, via phosphotyrosine binding and SH2 domains (24.Alberti L. Borrello M.G. Ghizzoni S. Torriti F. Rizzetti M.G. Pierotti M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1079-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 25.Arighi E. Alberti L. Torriti F. Ghizzoni S. Rizzetti M.G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39159-39166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We therefore considered the possibility that Shc and Grb2 may mediate the interaction of Cbl with RET. In a pull-down assay using a GST fusion of Grb2, a complex between Cbl and Grb2 was observed to associate with MEN2A-RET51 produced in transfected COS cells (Fig. 7A, third lane). As expected, the inactive RET mutant K758M was not recovered in these conditions (Fig. 7A, second lane). Cbl was found associated with Grb2 even in cells that did not express RET (Fig. 7A), which was in agreement with previous observations indicating that Cbl and Grb2 are constitutively associated within cells (28.Donovan J.A. Ota Y. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26369-26374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 29.Meisner H. Conway B.R. Hartley D. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3571-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the domains in Grb2, required for its ability to bridge Cbl and RET, indicated that both SH3 domains were necessary for its interaction with Cbl. Mutation of the conserved Trp residues W36G and W193G within the N- and C-terminal SH3 domains of Grb2, respectively, affected its ability to associate with Cbl in pull-down assays but did not affect its interaction with RET (Fig. 7A). The fact that only a partial reduction was observed in the single mutants indicated that both SH3 domains of Grb2 are involved in its interaction with Cbl. In co-immunoprecipitation assays in transfected COS cells, overexpression of wild type Grb2 but not the double mutant enhanced the interaction between RET51 and Cbl (Fig. 7B). Together, these findings indicate that Grb2 can bridge RET and Cbl via interaction of its two SH3 domains with the proline-rich C-terminal tail of Cbl and its SH2 domain with phosphorylated residues in RET, such as Tyr-1096, or in other adaptor proteins that are known to bind the receptor, such as Shc (see below). To assess the role of Shc, we transfected a GST fusion construct of the p52 isoform of Shc together with Cbl and either RET9 or RET51 and subsequently precipitated GST-Shc with glutathione beads. Both RET isoforms could be co-precipitated with Cbl and Shc in these experiments (Fig. 7C). However, a GST-Shc construct carrying mutations in the three tyrosine residues that are known docking sites for Grb2 (30.Cattaneo E. Pelicci P.G. Thomas D. Bradshaw R.A. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 476-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 31.Thomas D. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22293-22299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) interfered with the recruitment of Cbl to either of the RET isoforms while still being able to interact with RET (Fig. 7C). Interestingly, the effect of the 3F-Shc mutant on the interaction between RET and Cbl was more pronounced in the case of RET9 than RET51 (Fig. 7C), in agreement with the existence of a secondary site for Cbl recruitment in the long isoform of the RET receptor. Together, these findings suggest that phosphorylated Shc recruits Cbl to RET through Grb2, a mechanism of Cbl recruitment that appears to be common to both RET9 and RET51 because of their shared ability to bind Shc via phosphorylated Tyr-1062. On the other hand, the enhanced association of RET51 with Cbl could be accounted for by the additional, direct recruitment of Grb2 to phosphorylated Tyr-1096, which is only present in the long isoform. A Role for Shc as a Negative Regulator of RET Stability— One prediction of this model is the participation of Shc in the ubiquitylation of RET, a rather novel concept given the universally accepted role of Shc as a positive regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. In support of this notion, we found that overexpression of wild type Shc, but not its triple mutant, enhanced ubiquitylation of MEN2A-RET51 in transfected COS cells (Fig. 8A). Moreover, the 3F-Shc mutant. but not wild type Shc. was able to increase the half-life and thereby decrease the turnover of RET9 endogenously expressed in MN1 cells (Fig. 8B), indicating a novel function of Shc in the down-regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases. The ubiquitylation, or covalent conjugation of ubiquitin to proteins, is an important posttranslational modification utilized in various cellular processes. Polyubiquitylation is an essential step in the targeting of proteins for proteasomal degradation (18.Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar, 32.Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Monoubiquitylation on the other hand provides recognition signals that assist in regulating endocytic trafficking, membrane transport, and transcriptional regulation (33.Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). Ubiquitylation is a multistep event involving the sequential action of three different enzymes categorized as E1, E2, and E3 (18.Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar, 32.Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). The first two steps involve the conjugation of ubiquitin to an E1 enzyme and the transfer of the ubiquitin moiety to an E2 enzyme. The final step catalyzed by an E3 enzyme is the transfer of the ubiquitin from the E2 enzyme to the final protein substrate. The E3 enzymes, in addition to their protein ligase activity, are primarily responsible for the selection and recruitment of target protein substrates. Cbl belongs to a family of E3 ligases that require a RING finger domain for their catalytic activity (20.Lupher Jr., M.L. Rao N. Eck M.J. Band H. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 375-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 21.Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 476-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The role of Cbl proteins in the ubiquitylation and subsequent down-regulation of EGFR was the first demonstration of their role as ubiquitin ligases (34.Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Subsequently, other protein tyrosine kinases such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor, the receptor for colony stimulating factor-1, ErbB2, and Fyn are also reported to be ubiquitylated by Cbl (23.Levkowitz G.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1079-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that RET activation was accompanied by ubiquitylation in agreement with a previous report using an oncogenic form of this receptor (38.Carniti C. Perego C. Mondellini P. Pierotti M.A. Bongarzone I. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2234-2243PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the pattern of ubiquitylation was different between RET9 and RET51 isoforms, the latter being more ubiquitylated and consequently more efficiently down-regulated. RET ubiquitylation occurred as a consequence of the recruitment of Cbl. Consistent with the preferential ubiquitylation of the long isoform, Cbl interacted more strongly with RET51 than with RET9. The association of Cbl with RET9 was dependent on phosphorylation of Tyr-1062. However, Cbl could be additionally recruited through the phosphorylation of Tyr-1096 in RET51. Neither of the phosphorylation sites matched the canonical binding motif for the TKB domain of Cbl, and thus they do not mediate direct recruitment of this protein. Unlike EGFR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor that recruit Cbl through direct interaction between the TKB domain of Cbl and phosphorylated residues on the active receptors (34.Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 36.Miyake S. Mullane-Robinson K.P. Lill N.L. Douillard P. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16619-16628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), RET recruited Cbl by an alternative route that involved the adaptor molecules Shc and Grb2 (Fig. 8C). Our experiments demonstrated that upon interaction with RET9 and RET51 at phosphorylated Tyr-1062, Shc became phosphorylated and served as a platform that engaged Grb2 and Cbl. The interaction between Grb2 and Cbl appeared to be constitutive and involved the two SH3 domains of Grb2 and the proline-rich tail of Cbl. This was in agreement with our observation that deletion of the TKB domain of Cbl did not affect its association with either of the RET isoforms. The interaction of the SH2 domain of Grb2 with phosphorylated Tyr-1096 of RET51 provided an additional means to recruit Cbl for this isoform. Grb2 has also been shown to play a similar role in the recruitment of Cbl to the EGFR (39.Waterman H. Katz M. Rubin C. Shtiegman K. Lavi S. Elson A. Jovin T. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Our results implicate Shc in a previously undescribed role as a negative regulator of a receptor tyrosine kinase. Recently, the scaffold protein FRS2 has been reported to mediate the recruitment of Cbl via Grb2 to the fibroblast growth factor receptor (40.Wong A. Lamothe B. Lee A. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Li A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6684-6689Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Because FRS2 can also dock at Tyr-1062 of RET (41.Kurokawa K. Iwashita T. Murakami H. Hayashi H. Kawai K. Takahashi M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1929-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 42.Melillo R.M. Santoro M. Ong S.H. Billaud M. Fusco A. Hadari Y.R. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4177-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), it is likely that it shares functions with Shc in the down-regulation of this receptor. Perhaps the underlying mechanism in the hyphomorphism of RET51 during embryogenesis lies in its more efficient down-regulation as a consequence of a tighter coupling to the ubiquitylation machinery. However, this interpretation does not preclude other not mutually exclusive possibilities, including differences in downstream signaling pathways activated by the two receptor isoforms. Our inability to identify heterodimers of RET9 and RET51 suggests that the signal transduction events mediated by each isoform are compartmentalized and independent of each other. Why several isoforms of RET are generated by alternative splicing can only be speculated about at this point. Expression of RET9 and RET43 precedes expression of RET51 during normal kidney development in humans (43.Ivanchuk S.M. Myers S.M. Mulligan L.M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 991-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting that RET51 may have functions more related to differentiation rather than induction of the ureteric bud. A more thorough analysis of isoform expression would be necessary to assert this hypothesis. The unexpectedly low number of genes found in the mammalian genome, compared with that of insects or nematodes, has been rationalized by a relatively higher incidence of alternative splicing in mammalian species that would presumably result in increased molecular diversity. Our analysis, revealing distinct mechanisms in the negative regulation of two alternatively spliced products of the ret gene, is in agreement with this notion and offers an explanation for some of the differences in the biological activities of these receptor isoforms.

The objective of this study was to identify the cis-regulatory DNA region involved in this process. By cotransfection analyses of shotgun DNA fragments of a bacterial artificial chromosome sequence containing the entire human IGF-I gene and a large 5′-flanking region, a ∼700-bp DNA region ∼75 kb 5′ to the IGF-I gene was found to have the ability to enhance gene expression from both heterologous and homologous promoters in the presence of constitutively active STAT5a or STAT5b. This 700-bp DNA region contains two closely located consensus STAT5-binding sites, and its sequence appears to be evolutionarily conserved. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays verified the ability of the two putative STAT5-binding sites to bind to STAT5a and STAT5b. Cotransfection analyses confirmed that both STAT5-binding sites were necessary for the 700-bp DNA region to mediate STAT5a or STAT5b activation of gene transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that the chromosomal region containing these two STAT5-binding sites was bound by constitutively active STAT5b protein in HepG2 cells and that the binding was accompanied by increased expression of IGF-I mRNA. In reconstituted GH-responsive cells, this 700-bp DNA region was able to mediate GH-induced STAT5a or STAT5b activation of gene expression. These results together suggest that this STAT5-binding site-containing distal 5′-flanking region of IGF-I gene may be an enhancer mediating GH-induced STAT5 activation of IGF-I gene transcription.

Cotransfection analyses confirmed that both STAT5-binding sites were necessary for the 700-bp DNA region to mediate STAT5a or STAT5b activation of gene transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that the chromosomal region containing these two STAT5-binding sites was bound by constitutively active STAT5b protein in HepG2 cells and that the binding was accompanied by increased expression of IGF-I mRNA. In reconstituted GH-responsive cells, this 700-bp DNA region was able to mediate GH-induced STAT5a or STAT5b activation of gene expression. These results together suggest that this STAT5-binding site-containing distal 5′-flanking region of IGF-I gene may be an enhancer mediating GH-induced STAT5 activation of IGF-I gene transcription. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) 1The abbreviations used are: IGF-I, insulin-like growth factor-I; BAC, bacteria artificial chromosome; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; GH, growth hormone; GHRE, growth hormone-responsive element; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; TK, thymidine kinase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. is an important endocrine and paracrine regulator of cell proliferation and metabolism (1Daughaday W.H. Rotwein P. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 68-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). Most of the circulating IGF-I is produced from the liver (2Sjogren K. Liu J.L. Blad K. Skrtic S. Vidal O. Wallenius V. LeRoith D. Tornell J. Isaksson O.G. Jansson J.O. Ohlsson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7088-7092Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), and IGF-I production in this tissue is primarily controlled by pituitary growth hormone (GH) at the transcriptional level (3Mathews L.S. Norstedt G. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9343-9347Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 4Bichell D.P. Kikuchi K. Rotwein P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1899-1908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GH regulation of IGF-I gene expression has been known for decades, but the underlying mechanism is not completely understood. Because the effect of GH on IGF-I gene expression is rapid (4Bichell D.P. Kikuchi K. Rotwein P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1899-1908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gronowski A.M. Rotwein P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4741-4748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and independent of protein synthesis (6Gronowski A.M. Le Stunff C. Rotwein P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), GH-induced IGF-I gene expression is believed to result from GH-induced direct interaction of transcription factors with regulatory DNA regions in the IGF-I gene. A lot of work has been attempted to map such regulatory DNA regions (7Thomas M.J. Kikuchi K. Bichell D.P. Rotwein P. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1584-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 8Le Stunff C. Thomas M.J. Rotwein P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2230-2237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Thomas M.J.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but a convincing GH-responsive regulatory region has not been identified. The slow progress in identifying the cis-regulatory DNA regions mediating GH induction of IGF-I gene transcription is perhaps due to the lack of convenient GH-responsive cell lines and the complexity of IGF-I gene structure. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b (STAT5b) is a well established component of the GH signaling pathway (13Carter-Su C. Rui L. Herrington J. Pediatr. Nephrol. 2000; 14: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The STAT5b-null mice had 50% less liver IGF-I mRNA and 30% lower serum IGF-I concentration than the wild-type mice (14Davey H.W. Xie T. McLachlan M.J. Wilkins R.J. Waxman D.J. Grattan D.R. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3836-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G. Wilkins R.J. Park S.H. Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. Davey H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

McLachlan M.J. Wilkins R.J. Waxman D.J. Grattan D.R. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3836-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a dominant-negative STAT5b mutant completely prevented GH-induced IGF-I gene expression in the liver, whereas that of a constitutively active STAT5b mutant led to robust, GH-independent IGF-I gene expression in the hypophysectomized rats (16Woelfle J. Billiard J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22696-22702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). A homozygous STAT5b gene mis-sense mutation was recently discovered to cause a series of characteristics of growth hormone insensitivity, including reduced serum IGF-I concentration in a human patient (17Kofoed E.M. Hwa V. Little B. Woods K.A. Buckway C.K. Tsubaki J. Pratt K.L. Bezrodnik L. Jasper H. Tepper A. Heinrich J.J. Rosenfeld R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). These findings together indicate that STAT5b is a key transcription factor mediating GH regulation of IGF-I gene transcription. In addition to STAT5b, STAT5a, a protein that is 96% identical in sequence to STAT5b (18Liu X. Robinson G.W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Hennighausen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8831-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) and recognizes the same DNA sequence as STAT5b (19Ehret G.B. Reichenbach P. Schindler U. Horvath C.M. Fritz S. Nabholz M. Bucher P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6675-6688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), may be another transcription factor mediating GH stimulation of IGF-I gene transcription. Supporting this role of STAT5a is the observations that STAT5a and STAT5b double knock-out mice had lower serum IGF-I levels and showed severer growth retardation than STAT5b knock-out mice (20Teglund S. McKay C. Schuetz E. van Deursen J.M. Stravopodis D. Wang D. Brown M. Bodner S. Grosveld G. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Because GH stimulation of IGF-I gene expression may be directly mediated by STAT5, the cis-regulatory DNA regions involved might be the regions that contain STAT5-binding sites. A region within the rat IGF-I intron 2 has recently been identified to contain two STAT5-binding sites and to mediate GH-stimulated IGF-I gene expression in the liver of rats (21Woelfle J. Chia D.J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51261-51266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, we have found that the corresponding human or bovine IGF-I intron 2 region bears limited sequence homology to the rat IGF-I intron 2 region and contains only one putative STAT5-binding site. We therefore hypothesized that GH-induced STAT5 activation of IGF-I gene expression in humans might be mediated by DNA regions other than or in addition to the IGF-I intron 2 region. By cotransfection analysis of a large chromosomal region containing the human IGF-I gene with constitutively active STAT5 proteins, we have identified an evolutionarily conserved distal 5′-flanking region of IGF-I gene that contains two consensus STAT5-binding sites and can mediate GH-induced STAT5 activation of gene expression. Shotgun Library Construction—A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone (RP11–210L7) containing the entire human IGF-I gene and the ∼84-kb 5′-flanking region was purchased from BAC-PAC Resources (Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, CA). The BAC plasmid DNA was purified using a Plasmid Maxiprep kit (Qiagen) and sheared by sonication. The sonicated DNA was size-fractionated by gel electrophoresis, and fragments between 2 and 4 kb were selected and purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Ends of DNA fragments were blunted with T4 and Klenow DNA polymerases. The resultant DNA fragments were ligated into SmaI-digested and dephosphorylated pGL2-Promoter vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and transformed into Escherichia coli strain DH10B cells by electroporation. Approximately 300 clones were randomly picked to verify the inclusion of inserts in the plasmids. Plasmid Construction—A 940-bp promoter 1 of human IGF-I gene, from which class 1 IGF-I mRNA is transcribed, was amplified by PCR (Table I) and subsequently cloned into pGL2-Basic vector (Promega) to generate plasmid IGFP1-pGL2B. A 2871-bp human IGF-I intron 2 region was amplified by PCR (Table I) and cloned into pGL2-Promoter vector to generate plasmid IGFIntron2-pGL2P. The 700-bp distal 5′-flanking region of IGF-I gene, identified as a STAT5-binding enhancer in this study, was amplified by PCR (Table I) and inserted upstream of the SV40 promoter in pGL2-Promoter vector, the human IGF-I promoter in IGFP1-pGL2B, and a minimal thymidine kinase (TK) promoter in pGL2-TK vector to generate plasmids 700bp-pGL2P, 700bp-IGFP1-pGL2B, and 700bp-pGL2-TK, respectively. The pGL2-TK vector was prepared by inserting the TK promoter from pSPI-LUC plasmid (provided by Dr. Tim Wood from Karolinska Institute, Novum, Huddinge, Sweden) (22Wood T.J. Sliva D. Lobie P.E. Goullieux F. Mui A.L. Groner B. Norstedt G. Haldosen L.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 130: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) into pGL2-Basic vector. Six copies of a growth hormone response element (GHRE), each containing two adjacent STAT5-binding sites (22Wood T.J. Sliva D. Lobie P.E. Goullieux F. Mui A.L. Groner B. Norstedt G. Haldosen L.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 130: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), were removed from pSPI-LUC and inserted upstream in pGL2-Promoter vector to generate pGL2P-GHRE. The inserts in all new plasmids were verified by sequencing.Table ISequences of oligonucleotides used in this studyNameSequenceCorresponding regions in GenBank™Application700bp-F5′-GGCTCTGCCCGGGAAGTGGGTTTGG-3′7324-7336, AC010202PCR of 700-bp distal 5′-flanking region of hIGF-I, mIGF-I and bIGF-I genes700bp-R5′-TCTAAGGTACCAATTGTGTGAAGCCT-3′7979-7993, AC010202700bpm1-F5′-AGGAAAATGCGGCCGCACTGTTCCCAAAGTG-3′7419-7433, AC010202Mutation of STAT5 site 1 in 700-bp distal 5′-flanking region of hIGF-I700bpm1-R5′-GGAACAGTGCGGCCGCATTTTCCTGACTAAT-3′7396-7410, AC010202700bpm2-F5′-TCGCCTTTGCGGCCGCAGTAAGAGCAAAACCTCAA-3′7647-7665, AC010202Mutation of STAT5 site 2 in 700-bp distal 5′-flanking region of hIGF-I700bpm2-R5′-CTCTTACTGCGGCCGCAAAGGCGATAATTGTGT-3′7622-7638, AC010202hIGF-I-P1F5′-AAGGGTACCTCTTTGTCTCTGACATTCA-3′82410-82428, AC010202PCR of hIGF-I proximal promoter 1hIGF-I-P1R5′-ACTCTCGAGATTGGGTTGGAAGACTGCTG-3′84210-84229, AC010202hIGF-I-I2F5′-ACCGAATTCTGCTGTAAAAGATCTG-3′86051-86066, AC010202PCR of hIGF-I intron 2hIGF-I-I2R5′-ACACGAACTGGAGAGCATCC-3′88894-88913, AC010202hIGF-I-700F5′-GATTGGTTGTGTGGCATGAG-3′7336-7355, AC010202PCR of STAT5 binding sites-containing distal 5′-flanking region of hIGF-I in ChIPhIGF-I-700R5′-TGGCATGTTTTGAGGTTTTG-3′7655-7674, AC010202hIGF-I-E4F5′-ACAAGCCCACGGGGTATGGC-3′144890-144909, AC010202PCR of hIGF-I exon 4 in ChIPhIGF-I-E4R5′-CTTCTGAGCCTTGGGCATGTCG-3′145050-145071, AC010202bGHR-F5′-GCCATAAAGCCTGGAGGAAC-3′1-20, AY748827PCR of bGHR cDNAbGHR-R5′-TCTCTCTAGACCTGTGCCATTCAATGGGTAG-3′2016-2026, AY748827STAT5 sitel-F5′-AAATTCTAAGAAACT-3′7407-7421, AC010202EMSASTAT5 site2-F5′-TTTTTCTTAGAAGTA-3′7636-7650, AC010202EMSA Open table in a new tab Either or both putative STAT5-binding sites in the 700-bp distal 5′-flanking region of IGF-I gene in plasmid 700bp-pGL2P were replaced with one or two NotI sites to generate STAT5-binding site-mutated constructs 700bpm1-pGL2P (in which the first STAT5-binding site was mutated), 700bpm2-pGL2P (in which the second STAT5-binding site was mutated), and 700bpm3-pGL2P (in which both STAT5-binding sites were mutated). The mutations were made by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (Table I). The mutated inserts from these pGL2P-based constructs were inserted into pGL2TK vector at the SmaI and KpnI sites to generate the pGL2TK-based mutation constructs 700bpm1-pGL2TK, 700bpm2-pGL2TK, and 700bpm3-pGL2TK, respectively. All of the mutations were confirmed by sequencing. A standard reverse transcription-PCR was used to clone the complete coding region of the bovine GHR mRNA. Briefly, liver poly(A) mRNA from a Holstein cow was reverse transcribed into cDNA in the presence of an oligo(dT) primer. The cDNA was then amplified by PCR with primers (Table I) based on the bovine GHR mRNA sequence (23Hauser S.D. McGrath M.F. Collier R.J. Krivi G.G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1990; 72: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The PCR products were cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen), generating bovine GHR expression plasmid pcDNA3-bGHR. The GHR cDNA sequence was confirmed by sequencing. The ability of the pcDNA3-bGHR plasmid to express GHR protein was verified by in vitro transcription and translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. The expression plasmids encoding wild-type mouse STAT5a, constitutively active STAT5a mutant STAT5a-N642H, and wild-type mouse STAT5b were provided by Dr. Kouichi Ariyoshi (The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan) (24Ariyoshi K.

The plasmid encoding constitutively active STAT5b mutant STAT5bCA was provided by Dr. Peter Rotwein (Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR) (16Woelfle J. Billiard J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22696-22702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Cotransfection Analysis—MAC-T cells, a bovine mammary epithelial cell line (25Huynh H.T. Robitaille G. Turner J.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 197: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with l-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. CHO cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in minimum essential medium containing sodium pyruvate, l-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum. All of the reagents used in cell culture were from Sigma. In the transfection analyses to identify STAT5-responsive IGF-I DNA regions, 0.5 μg of reporter gene construct and 40 ng of STAT5 expression plasmid were cotransfected with 1 ng of pRL-CMV (transfection efficiency control plasmid from Promega) into 50% confluent MAC-T cells in 24-well plates using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were lysed, and the luciferase activities were measured using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). In the transfection analyses that were used to determine GH response, cells in each well were transfected with 0.5 μg of the respective reporter gene construct, 200 ng of bovine GHR expression plasmid, 200 ng of wild-type STAT5a or STAT5b expression plasmid, and 1 ng of pRL-CMV. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium, and the cells were grown for a further 16 h. Following that, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium containing 500 ng/ml recombinant bovine GH (provided by the National Hormone and Peptide Program), and the cells were grown for another 8 h before luciferase assay. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Double-stranded oligonucleotides (Table I) corresponding to the two putative STAT5-binding sites in the distal 5′-flanking region of human IGF-I gene were end-labeled with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Nuclear proteins were prepared from CHO cells transfected with STAT5a-N642H or STAT5bCA expression plasmid, according to a standard protocol (26Weinmann A.S. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Ten μg of nuclear proteins were incubated with 2 μg of anti-STAT5a (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), anti-STAT5b antibody (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA), or 2 μg of the corresponding preimmune serum in reaction buffer containing 20% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 1 h at 4 °C. The binding reactions were subsequently added with 1 × 105 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe, and the incubations were continued for 1 h at 4 °C. The reactions were resolved on native 6% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried, exposed to phosphor screens, and scanned on a Molecular Imager FX System (Bio-Rad). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—This assay was performed as described (26Weinmann A.S. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Approximately 1 × 106 human hepatoma-derived HepG2 cells (ATCC) were transiently transfected with 20 μg of STAT5bCA expression plasmid. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min at 25 °C, followed by termination of the reaction with 125 mm glycine. The nuclei were subsequently isolated and sonicated with 10 pulses of 10 s each at power setting 35% using the sonic dismembrator model 300 (Fisher). The following steps were performed using a ChIP kit, following the manufacturer's directions (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) with minor modifications. Briefly, ∼33% of the sonicated chromatin was saved as “input,” and the rest was cleared twice to reduce nonspecific immunoprecipitation with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry. One half of the precleared chromatin was incubated with 3 μg of anti-STAT5b antibody (Abcam Inc.), and the other half was incubated with 3 μg of preimmune rabbit serum at 4 °C overnight. The immunocomplexes were collected with protein A-agarose and washed stringently to remove nonspecific antibody binding. The DNA-protein complexes were eluted, and the cross-linking was reversed by incubation at 65 °C for 6 h. The DNA from input-, antibody-, or preimmune serum-treated chromatin samples was isolated and purified by standard proteinase K digestion, phenol-chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. The purified DNA from each sample was resuspended in 50 μl of water. From the purified DNA, the relative levels of the STAT5-binding site-containing distal 5′-flanking region of IGF-I gene or that of IGF-I exon 4 were quantified by PCR with specific primers (Table I) under 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 30 s or 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s, respectively. Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA from HepG2 cells 48 h after transfection with or without the constitutively active STAT5bCA expression plasmid was isolated using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). The RNA quality was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. One μg of RNA was reverse transcribed using ImProm-II™ reverse transcriptase (Promega) and random hexamers at 42 °C for 2 h, and the levels of IGF-I mRNA and GAPDH mRNA were subsequently quantified with real time PCR using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays identification numbers Hs00153126_m1 and Hs99999905_m1, respectively, and TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix on an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The real time PCR conditions were 50 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The real time PCR data were analyzed using the 2–ΔΔCT method, according to the manufacturer's directions. Statistical Analysis—The luciferase activity data from cotransfection and real time PCR analyses were analyzed by one-factor analysis of variance, followed by t test to compare two means or the Tukey test to compare multiple means. All of the statistical analyses were performed using the respective programs of SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All of the data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Differences at p < 0.05 were considered significant. Identification of STAT5-binding Enhancers in a 170-kb Human Chromosomal Region Containing IGF-I Gene—Most of the previous studies attempted to identify GH-responsive DNA regions focused on the IGF-I promoter or IGF-I intronic regions proximal to the transcription start site (7Thomas M.J.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To identify potentially distal GH-responsive DNA regions, we mapped a 170-kb BAC sequence containing the entire human IGF-I gene and the ∼84-kb 5′-flanking region for STAT5-binding enhancers. A shotgun library of this 170-kb BAC insert was constructed in the enhancer-less pGL2-promoter vector pGL2P. From this library, 115 plasmids, which contained inserts 2–4 kb and were estimated to give a 2-fold coverage of the 170-kb BAC sequence, were each cotransfected with a plasmid expressing the constitutively active STAT5 mutant STAT5a-N642H (24Ariyoshi K. Nosaka T. Yamada K. Onishi M. Oka Y. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24407-24413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) or the corresponding empty plasmid into MAC-T cells. As shown in Fig. 1, the activity of the positive control construct pGL2P-GHRE that contains 12 copies of STAT5-binding site from the Spi 2.1 gene (22Wood T.J. Sliva D. Lobie P.E. Goullieux F. Mui A.L. Groner B. Norstedt G. Haldosen L.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 130: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was increased 6.5-fold on average by STAT5a-N642H, validating the effectiveness of the assay in identifying STAT5-responsive enhancers. The increases (or decreases) in reporter gene expression from most of the IGF-I DNA-containing pGL2P plasmids were within two times of standard deviation (0.267) of that from the vector plasmid (Fig. 1), and these changes were considered not significant. The increases in reporter gene expression from five plasmids, plasmids 11, 43, 73, 74, and 94, were greater than two times the standard deviation of that from pGL2P (Fig. 1), and the DNA inserts in these five plasmids were believed to have the ability to mediate STAT5 activation of gene expression and were selected to be sequenced. By aligning the sequences of these inserts with the sequence (GenBank™ accession number AC010202) of the 170-kb BAC insert, the inserts in plasmids 11, 43, 73, and 94 were found to belong to the 5′-flanking region of IGF-I gene and the insert in plasmid 74 corresponded to IGF-I exon 3 and its downstream region. The inserts in plasmids 73 and 94 were further found to overlap over a 1.2-kb DNA fragment that is located ∼75 kb 5′ from IGF-I exon 1, corresponding to the region between nucleotide 6804 and nucleotide 8046 in GenBank™ accession number AC010202 (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2A distal 5′-flanking region of IGF-I gene is evolutionarily conserved and contains two consensus STAT5-binding sites. A, the ∼700-bp DNA region shared by the STAT5-responsive constructs 73 and 94 in Fig. 1 is located ∼75 kb 5′ from IGF-I exon 1 in the human genome. The 700-bp DNA region is shown as a black box. The exons and introns of IGF-I gene are shown as open boxes and lines, respectively (not drawn to scale). The 5′ and 3′ border nucleotides of each exon and the 700-bp DNA region are numbered according to GenBank™ accession number AC010202 (version 6). B, the 700-bp human DNA sequence has a homologous region in the bovine, mouse, and rat genome and contains two consensus STAT5-binding sites.

The human sequence corresponds to the region 7310–8018 in AC010202; the bovine sequence was obtained by PCR of a bovine BAC clone (RP42–161J14) containing IGF-I gene; the mouse sequence corresponds to the region 95116–94449 in AC125082 (version 3); and the rat sequence corresponds to the region 898857–899387 in NW_044015 (version 1).

We analyzed this overlapped 1.2-kb DNA sequence for putative STAT5-binding sites using the MATCH program (27Kel A.E. Gossling E. Reuter I. Cheremushkin E. Kel-Margoulis O.V. Wingender E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3576-3579Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Two potential STAT5-binding sites were identified, being 100% identical to the consensus STAT5-binding sequence TTCC/tT/cagG/aGAA (19Ehret G.B. Reichenbach P. Schindler U. Horvath C.M. Fritz S.

Containing two closely located consensus STAT5-binding sites suggests that the inserts in plasmids 73 and 94 may mediate STAT5 activation of reporter gene expression through direct interactions with STAT5 at these sites. We also searched the inserts in plasmids 11, 43, and 74 for potential STAT5-binding sites. Plasmids 11 and 74 each contained one consensus STAT5-binding site (sequence not shown), suggesting that these plasmids may also mediate STAT5 transactivation via direct binding of STAT5. Plasmid 43 did not contain a consensus STAT5-binding site; the DNA insert in this plasmid may contain an unconventional STAT5-binding site, or it may mediate transactivation through a second transcription factor that is activated by STAT5. A computer search of the 170-kb BAC sequence revealed 29 putative STAT5-binding sites (TTCC/tT/cagG/aGAA) in addit"
https://openalex.org/W2093882164,"Cell death is generally believed to occur either by accidental, lytic necrosis or by programmed cell death, that is, apoptosis. The initiation and execution of cell death, however, is far more complex and includes pathways like caspase-independent apoptosis or actively triggered necrosis. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of cell death induced by arsenic trioxide (arsenite, As2O3), a clinically efficient agent in anticancer therapy. As2O3-induced cell death coincides with cytochrome c release, facilitates mitochondrial permeability transition and is sensitive to inhibition by Bcl-xL, indicating that cell demise is regulated through the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Nevertheless, only little caspase-3 activation was observed and As2O3-induced cell death was only weakly obstructed by the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. Moreover, disruption of caspase-9 or -2 failed to decrease the amount of As2O3-mediated cell death. Interestingly, As2O3-induced cell death had a predominantly necrosis-like phenotype as assessed by Annexin-V/propidium iodide staining and LDH release. Finally, blocking glutathione synthetase by buthionine sulfoximine enhanced the As2O3-mediated necrosis-like cell death without increasing caspase-3 cleavage. As2O3 does, however, not directly inhibit caspases, but appears to interfere with caspase activation. Altogether, our data clearly delineate a mode of As2O3-triggered cell death that differs considerably from that induced by conventional anticancer drugs. These findings may explain the capability of As2O3 to efficiently kill even chemoresistant tumor cells with disturbed apoptosis signaling and caspase activation, a frequent finding in malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W2066409164,"High levels of the Wilms' Tumor 1 (WT1) protein and mRNA had been associated with aggressive phenotypes of breast tumors. Here we report that the HER2/neu oncogene increases WT1 expression. Approximately threefold higher levels of WT1 protein were observed in MCF-7 breast cancer cells transfected with the HER2/neu oncogene than in parental MCF-7 cells. Conversely, inhibition of HER2/neu with the anti-HER2/neu trastuzumab (Herceptintrade mark) antibody decreased WT1 protein levels in HER2/neu-overexpressing BT-474 and SKBr3 cells. We also found that HER2/neu engages Akt to regulate WT1 levels since inhibition of Akt reduced WT1 levels. Decreased expression of WT1 protein led to cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase and increased apoptosis in HER2/neu-overexpressing cells, which is correlated with decreased cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 levels. Our data indicate that HER2/neu engages Akt to increase WT1 expression, and that WT1 protein plays a vital role in regulating cell cycle progression and apoptosis in HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2040288095,"RECQ4 is a member of the RecQ helicase family, which has been implicated in the regulation of DNA replication, recombination and repair. p53 modulates the functions of RecQ helicases including BLM and WRN. In this study, we demonstrate that p53 can regulate the transcription of RECQ4. Using nontransformed, immortalized normal human fibroblasts, we show that p53-dependent downregulation of RECQ4 expression occurred in G1-arrested cells, both in the absence or presence of exogenous DNA damage. Wild-type p53 (but not the tumor-derived mutant forms) repressed RECQ4 promoter activity. The camptothecin or etoposide-dependent p53-mediated repression was attenuated by trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Repression of the RECQ4 promoter was accompanied with an increased accumulation of HDAC1, and the loss of SP1 and p53 binding to the promoter. The simultaneous formation of a camptothecin-dependent p53-SP1 complex indicated its occurrence outside of the RECQ4 promoter. These data suggest that p53-mediated repression of RECQ4 transcription during DNA damage results from the modulation of the promoter occupancy of transcription activators and repressors."
https://openalex.org/W2078672321,"Sequence-specific DNA binding is a major activity of the tumor suppressor p53 and a prerequisite for the transactivating potential of the protein. p53 interaction with target DNA is tightly regulated by various mechanisms, including binding of different components of the transcription machinery, post-translational modifications, and interactions with other factors that modulate p53 transactivation in a cell context- and promoter-specific manner. The bi-functional redox factor 1 (Ref-1/APE1) has been identified as one of the factors, which can stimulate p53 DNA binding by redox-dependent as well as redox-independent mechanisms. Whereas stimulation of p53 DNA binding by the redox activities of Ref-1 is understood quite well, little is known about mechanisms that underlie the redox-independent effects of Ref-1. We report in this study a previously unknown activity of Ref-1 as a factor promoting tetramerization of p53. We demonstrate that Ref-1 promotes association of dimers into tetramers, and de-stacking of higher oligomeric forms into the tetrameric form in vitro, thereby enhancing p53 binding to target DNA."

To elucidate whether these mutations cause aberrant signal transduction in AML, we used gene expression profiling in a series of 110 newly diagnosed AML patients with normal karyotype. The different algorithms used for data analysis revealed highly concordant sets of genes, indicating that the identified gene signatures are specific for each analysed subgroup. Whereas samples with FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD could be separated with up to 100% accuracy, this did not apply for NRAS-PM and wild-type samples, suggesting that only FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD are associated with an apparent signature in AML. The set of discriminating genes included several known genes, which are involved in cell cycle control (CDC14A, WEE1), gene transcription (HOXB5, FOXA1), and signal transduction (SMG1). In conclusion, we showed that unique gene expression patterns can be correlated with FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD. This might lead to the identification of further pathogenetic relevant candidate genes particularly in AML with normal karyotype."

https://openalex.org/W2075194761,"CHFR, a novel checkpoint gene inactivated in human cancer, delays chromosome condensation in cells treated with microtubule poisons. To understand the molecular mechanism for this delay, we characterized cells with inactivated CHFR and stably transfected derivatives expressing the wild-type gene. After exposure to microtubule poisons, the CHFR-expressing cells arrested transiently in early prophase with a characteristic ruffled morphology of the nuclear envelope and no signs of chromosome condensation. Several markers suggested that Cyclin A/Cdc2 had been activated, whereas Aurora-A and -B and Cyclin B1/Cdc2 were inactive. Further, Cyclin B1 was excluded from the nucleus. Ectopic expression of Cyclin B1 with a mutant nuclear export sequence induced chromosome condensation, and thus overcame the CHFR checkpoint. We conclude that the mechanism by which CHFR delays chromosome condensation involves inhibition of accumulation of Cyclin B1 in the nucleus."

Homologous recombination plays important roles in DNA metabolisms, including several DNA repair processes and the generation of genetic diversity in living cells. The Holliday junction (HJ) 1The abbreviations used are: HJ, Holliday junction; DTT, dithiothreitol; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); RPA, replication protein A.1The abbreviations used are: HJ, Holliday junction; DTT, dithiothreitol; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); RPA, replication protein A. is an important intermediate during the homologous recombination process (1.Holliday R. Genet. Res. 1964; 5: 282-304Crossref Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of the early stage of homologous recombination has been extensively investigated, and the proteins involved in this process are conserved in the three biological domains: Bacteria, Eukarya, and Archaea (2.Kowalczykowski S.C.

On the other hand, the protein factors involved in the late stage of the process have been identified only in Bacteria, in which the RuvABC-Holliday junction complex processes the recombinational intermediates (4.Shinagawa H.

A recent report showed that RAD51C, a RAD51 paralog in human cells, is involved in HJ processing (10.Liu Y. Masson J.-Y. Shah R. O'Regan P. West S.C. Science. 2004; 303: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar).Archaea, the third domain of life (11.Woese C.R. Fox G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5088-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar), is distinct from both Bacteria and Eukarya. Archaea share many similarities with Eukarya in their genetic information processing pathways, including DNA replication, transcription, and translation (12.Olsen G.J. Woese C.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 991-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), although cellular structure is prokaryotic. Therefore, the archaeal processes provide a useful model systems to understand the much more complex mechanisms of their eukaryotic equivalents. Proteins involved in homologous recombination are also conserved between Archaea and Eukarya. We characterized the Pyrococcus furiosus RadA and RadB proteins (13.Hayashi I. Morikawa K. Ishino Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4695-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14.Komori K. Miyata T. DiRuggiero J. Holley-Shanks R. Hayashi I. Cann I.K.O. Mayanagi K. Shinagawa H. Ishino Y. J.

These archaeal recombinases have sequences more similar to that of eukaryotic Rad51 than bacterial RecA (16.Uemori T. Sato Y. Kato I. Ishino Y. Genes Cells. 1995; 2: 499-512Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 17.DiRuggiero J. Robb F. Le Gal Y. Halvorson H. New Developments in Marine Bio/Technology. Plenum Press, New York1998: 193-196Google Scholar). In addition, we showed that the P. furiosus RPA, which is composed of three subunits, RPA41, RPA14, and RPA32, like the eukaryotic RPA (p70-p14-p32), but different from bacterial SSB (homotetramer), clearly stimulated a RadA-mediated strand exchange reaction (18.Komori K. Ishino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25654-25660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The homologs of the eukaryotic Rad50 and Mre11 proteins, which may work in the very early steps of homologous recombination, after double-stranded break repair, are also conserved in Archaea (19.Hopfner K.P.

Tainer J.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 473-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Regarding the late stage, in which the HJ intermediates are processed, we identified an archaeal HJ resolvase and named it Hjc (21.Komori K. Sakae S. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Ishino Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8873-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Contrary to our expectations, Hjc is an archaea-specific protein, and neither its sequence nor its three-dimensional structure is similar to other known HJ resolvases (22.Komori K. Sakae S.

Ishino Y. Morikawa K. Structure. 2001; 9: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Therefore, the HJ resolvase is quite interesting, from an evolutional point of view (24.Lilley D.M. White M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9351-9353Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).In our series of experiments, we fractionated P. furiosus cell extracts by several chromatography steps and assayed for the ATP-dependent resolution of synthetic Holliday junctions to identify the activity for HJ branch migration in archaea. The target activity was identified in the column fractions, and the optimal reaction conditions for the activity were determined, using the partially purified fraction. Then we succeeded in cloning the corresponding gene by screening a heat-stable protein library of P. furiosus. The gene, hjm (Holliday junction migration), encodes Hjm, which is composed of 720 amino acids. The Hjm protein is conserved in Archaea, and there are some eukaryotic proteins sharing sequence similarity to Hjm. The physiological functions of Hjm in archaeal cells and the evolution of the Hjm protein are very interesting themes to consider.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSynthetic DNA Substrates—Oligonucleotides with the following sequences were synthesized: sequence 1, 5′-GTGACCGTCTCCGGGAGCTGCATGTGTCAGAGGTTTTCACCGTCATCACCGAAACGCGCGAGACGAAAGG-3′; sequence 2, 5′-CCTTTCGTCTCGCGCGTTTCGGTGATGACGGTGAAAACCTCTGACACATGGCCAGCCCCGACACCCGCCA-3′; sequence 3, 5′-TGGCGGGTGTCGGGGCTGGCCATGTGTCAGAGGTTTTCACCGTCATCACCCGCCGGGCAAGAGCAACTCG-3′; sequence 4, 5′-CGAGTTGCTCTTGCCCGGCGGGTGATGACGGTGAAAACCTCTGACACATGCAGCTCCCGGAGACGGTCAC-3′; sequence 5, 5′-CGAGCGACAGGAACCTCGAGAAGCTTCAATCGGCTCAGACCGAGCAGAATTCTATGTGTTTACCAAGCGCTG-3′; sequence 6, 5′-CAGCGCTTGGTAAACACATAGAATTCTGCTCGGTCTCTCGGCAGATTCTAGAAATCGACGCTAGCAAGTGAC-3′; sequence 7, 5′-GTCACTTGCTAGCGTCGATTTCTAGAATCTGCCGAGACTGGCTGTGGGATCCGAGCTGTCTAGAGACATCGA-3′; and sequence 8, 5′-TCGATGTCTCTAGACAGCTCGGATCCCACAGCCAGTGAGCCGATTGAAGCTTCTCGAGGTTCCTGTCGCTCG. These oligonucleotides were labeled at the 5′ termini with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. DNA substrates with specific structures were prepared by annealing the appropriate oligonucleotides in TAM buffer, containing 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, and 0.5 mm magnesium acetate. Four-way junctions with a 30-base pair (HSL) and a 2-base pair homologous region at the junction center (JY), were composed of oligonucleotides 1–4 and oligonucleotides 5–8, respectively. The Y-structured DNAs were composed of oligonucleotides 1 and 2 (Y1) and oligonucleotides 1 and 4 (Y2), respectively. The four-way junction with no homologous region at the junction center (4J) and the looped out and duplex DNAs were prepared as described previously (25.Komori K. Sakae S. Fujikane R. Morikawa K.

Syst. 2002; 77: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Partial Purification of the Branch Migration Activity from P. furiosus Cells—P. furiosus cells (DSM 3838 strain) were cultivated as described earlier (27.Uemori T. Ishino Y. Toh H. Asada K. Kato I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and 52 g of cells were obtained. The cells were disrupted by sonication in 500 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA and 10% glycerol) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, the cell-free extract was treated with polyethylenimine (final concentration, 0.15%) and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the precipitate was resuspended in 300 ml of buffer A containing 1 m ammonium sulfate, and the proteins were precipitated with ammonium sulfate (80% saturation). The precipitated proteins were resuspended in 60 ml of buffer A containing 2 m NaCl, and the eluted proteins were dialyzed against buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl. After dialysis, the supernatant was diluted with 2.5 volumes of buffer A, and the dialysate was applied to a heparin column (HiTrap heparin; Amersham Biosciences), which was developed with a 0.2–1.5 m NaCl gradient in buffer A. The active fractions, which eluted at 0.46–0.70 m NaCl, were dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) containing 0.1 m NaCl. The dialysate was applied to a HiTrap SP column (Amersham Biosciences), which was developed with a 0.10–0.60 m NaCl gradient in buffer B. The activity eluted at 0.18–0.38 m NaCl and was dialyzed against buffer A. The dialysate was applied to a HiTrap Q column, which was developed with a 0–1 m NaCl gradient. The activity eluted at 0.30–0.55 m NaCl and was dialyzed against buffer C (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01 mm CaCl2, and 10% glycerol). The dialysate was applied to a hydroxylapatite column (CHT-II; Bio-Rad), which was developed with a 0.01–1 m potassium phosphate gradient. The activity eluted at 0.10–0.30 m potassium phosphate and was dialyzed against buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm EDTA). The dialysate was applied to a phosphocellulose column (Whatman P-11), which was developed with 0–1.5 m NaCl. The activity eluted at 0.25–0.43 m NaCl and was dialyzed against buffer D. The dialysate was applied to a MonoS 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences), which was developed with 0–0.6 m NaCl. The activity eluted at 0.40–0.45 m NaCl. The active fractions were stored at 4 °C. The protein concentrations of the active fractions were quantified by using a protein assay kit (Advanced protein assay kit; Cytoskelton Inc.).Branch Migration Assay—Aliquots (2 μl) of each column fraction or purified Hjm protein were incubated with 5 nm of 32P-labeled synthetic HJ (HSL) in an 18-μl reaction mixture, containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm DTT at 55 °C for 30–60 min. The reactions were stopped by phenol, and the products were analyzed by PAGE using TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA) followed by autoradiography. For the quantitative analysis, the reaction products from each experiment were quantified from the autoradiograms using a laser-excited image analyzer (FLA5000; Fuji Film).Cloning of the Gene Responsible for the Branch Migration Activity— The cosmid-based genomic library and the heat-resistant fractions (heat-stable protein library) from each E. coli clone were prepared as described previously (21.Komori K. Sakae S. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Ishino Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8873-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The branch migration assay using a synthetic Holliday junction, HSL, was performed with the heat-stable protein library from 496 independent clones. Cosmid DNA was prepared from the clone encoding the branch migration activity and was digested by BamHI. The fragments were inserted into the pUC118 vector, and their nucleotide sequences were partially determined. The gene encoding the branch migration activity was identified by searching the prospective region of the P. furiosus genome with the determined sequence for an open reading frame encoding a nucleotide binding motif (P-loop). This gene was amplified by PCR, using the oligonucleotides 5′-CGAGCCATGGGGGTTGATGAGCTGAGAGTT-3′ and 5′-CGGGTCGACTCAAGATTTGAGAAAGTAATC-3′ as primers, from the P. furiosus genome. The amplified gene was cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega). The cloned gene was digested by NcoI-SalI and was inserted into the corresponding sites of pET21d (Novagen). The constructed plasmid was designated as pHJM100.Overexpression and Purification of the Hjm Protein—To obtain the recombinant Hjm protein, E. coli BL21 codonPlus™ (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) carrying pHJM100 was grown in 1 liter of LB medium, containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, at 37 °C. The cells were cultured to an A600 of 0.35, and then the expression of the hjm gene was induced by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm and continuing the culture for 5 h at 37 °C. After cultivation, the cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication in buffer A containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol. The soluble fraction, obtained by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 15 min), was heated at 80 °C for 20 min. The heat-resistant fraction was treated with 0.15% polyethylenimine. The soluble proteins were precipitated by 80% saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation. The precipitate was resuspended in buffer B containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 1.25 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol and was subjected to chromatography on a HiTrap Butyl (Amersham Biosciences). The proteins were eluted at 0 m ammonium sulfate, and the eluted proteins were dialyzed against buffer C containing 10 mm potassium phosphate, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01 mm CaCl2, and 10% glycerol. The dialysate was loaded onto a CHT-II column, and the proteins were eluted at 0.25–0.35 m potassium phosphate. The eluted proteins were dialyzed against buffer D containing 10% glycerol), and the dialysate was subjected to chromatography on a MonoQ 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences). The proteins were eluted at 0.32–0.37 m NaCl. The eluted protein was pooled and stored at 4 °C.Western Blot Analysis—P. furiosus cells (1 g) were disrupted by sonication in 15 ml of buffer B containing proteinase inhibitor (Complete™), and the extract was obtained by centrifugation. The P. furiosus cell extract (800 ng) and the purified Hjm proteins (1 ng) were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and reacted with anti-Hjm antiserum. The bands were detected by using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the supplier's recommendations.Gel Filtration and Glycerol Gradient Centrifugation—Gel filtration chromatography was performed with the SMART system (Amersham Biosciences). The MonoS fraction (fraction number 16) or purified recombinant Hjm protein was applied to a Superdex 200 3.2/30 column (Amersham Biosciences), pre-equilibrated with buffer E (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.3 m NaCl). The eluted fractions were subjected to a branch migration assay, as described above. The molecular mass of the protein with the branch migration activity was estimated from the elution profiles of standard marker proteins, including thyroglobulin (670,000), γ-globulin (158,000), ovalbumin (44,000), and myoglobin (17,000). Glycerol gradient centrifugation was performed as described earlier (28.Ishino Y. Iwasaki H. Fukui H. Mineno J. Kato I. Shinagawa H. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The purified Hjm protein (100 μg) was sedimented through a 10-ml continuous 10–35% (v/v) glycerol gradient by 40,000 rpm at 4 °C for 24 h in a Beckman SW41 rotor. The standard marker proteins as described above were sedimented under identical conditions.Branch Migration of Recombination Intermediates—The recombination intermediates were produced by in vitro strand exchange reaction using plasmid DNAs, as described previously (21.Komori K. Sakae S. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Ishino Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8873-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29.Muller B.C. Jones C. Kemper B. West S. Cell. 1990; 60: 329-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The single-stranded circular pUC118 DNA and the KasI-PstI-digested double-stranded pUC118 were mixed to produce a gapped DNA, and the gapped DNA (6 μm as nucleotide concentration) was preincubated with the E. coli RecA protein (2.7 μm) in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm ATP, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 5 min for the strand exchange reaction. To produce the α-structured DNA, recombination intermediates, 3′-32P-labeled linear DNA (PstI-digested) was added to 3 μm. After 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction mixture was deproteinized by phenol extraction. Purified Hjm protein was added to 100 nm to the solution containing α-structured DNA in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm DTT and was incubated at 55 °C for 0–60 min. The reaction products were deproteinized by incubation with proteinase K followed by phenol extraction and were separated by 12% agarose gel electrophoresis in TAE buffer. Detection of the products was performed by autoradiography.Computer Analysis of the Amino Acid Sequences—Search for the homologous sequences in the databases with BLAST was carried out at a website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/BLAST/). The gene corresponding to hjm has been registered as the gene number of PF0677 in the P. furiosus genome data base. The hjm homologs in the other archaeal genomes correspond to the gene numbers, PAB0592 (Pyrococues abyssi), AF2245m (Archaeoglobus fulgidus), HaloRad24b (Halobacterium salinarium), MTH810 (Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus), PAE0894 (Pyrobaculum aerophilum), SSO02462 (Sulfolobus solfataricus), STO 0590 (Sulfolobus tokodaii), and APE0191 (Aeropyrum pernix) in each genome data base. The sequences of human DNA polymerase θ, Hel308, and Drosophila melanogaster Mus308 were derived from the genes with accession numbers AAK39635, NP_598375, and AAB67306, respectively.RESULTSIdentification and Partial Purification of the Branch Migration Activity—We tried to identify the branch migration activity corresponding to that from the bacterial RuvB protein in P. furiosus cells. The total cell extracts of P. furiosus were fractionated by anion exchange (HiTrap SP) or cation exchange (HiTrap Q) chromatography, and the target activity was assayed using a 32P-labeled synthetic HJ. However, the branch migration activity to produce splayed arm DNAs was not detected in any fraction. Then polyethylenimine precipitation was done to concentrate the nucleic acid-binding proteins before the ammonium sulfate precipitation and the column chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These procedures were effective, and the branch migration activity eluted at 0.46–0.6 m NaCl during the elution of the heparin-Sepharose column with a linear NaCl gradient (Fig. 1A). As shown in the figure, the HJ resolvase activity by Hjc was separated from the branch migration activity in this chromatography step. The active fractions were further purified by sequential chromatography. Using the active fractions (fractions 15 and 16) from the cation exchange chromatography, as shown in Fig. 1B, the substrate specificity was examined. Several kinds of DNA substrates, including four-way junction, half-cruciform, looped-out, and normal duplex DNAs, were prepared by the combination of synthetic oligonucleotides as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Among these substrates, the four-way junction was preferentially dissolved (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1C, the fraction sample dissociated oligonucleotide annealed to M13 mp18 single-stranded DNA, in addition to the two HJs, HSL with large homologous core, and JY with small homologous core. This new helicase activity may have wider substrate preference when compared with that of RuvB helicase.Cloning and Expression of the Gene Encoding the Branch Migration Helicase—Based on the reaction conditions determined from the above section, we screened for the branch migration activity from the heat-stable P. furiosus protein libraries, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Among the 496 independent heat extracts of E. coli transformants, we found a clone producing a protein that dissolved the four-way junction DNA. Then the cosmid DNA was recovered from the E. coli clone, and the region containing the gene encoding the target activity was subcloned into the plasmid vector. A certain open reading frame with an ATP-binding motif (P-loop) was found after sequencing the cloned DNA. The gene for the open reading frame was cloned into the expression vector, pET21d for overexpression in E. coli. The recombinant E. coli cells carrying the resultant plasmid, pHJM100, were cultivated, and the encoded protein was successfully overproduced by isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction. The protein was purified to homogeneity by the three sequential chromatography steps as shown in Fig. 2A. The highly purified protein was used for the following characterization. Based on its activity to dissolve four-way junction DNA, we named the protein Hjm (Holliday junction migration). Using the highly purified Hjm protein, a polyclonal antibody was prepared. Western blotting analysis showed that a protein the same size as the recombinant Hjm protein, which also specifically reacted with the antibody, was present in the total extract from P. furiosus cells (Fig. 2B). The active fractions obtained during the purification procedure, as described above, also had a protein that reacted with the antibody (Fig. 2C). To investigate the oligomeric state of Hjm in solution, gel filtration chromatography was done (Fig. 2D). The elution profile showed that the estimated molecular weight of Hjm is 73,500, which is slightly smaller than that calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence (82, 631). This inconsistency may be explained by some interaction of Hjm with Sephadex resin, because chromatographic profile showed that the elution peak of Hjm was not symmetric but had some tailing. Glycerol gradient separation experiment showed that Hjm was sedimented to the position corresponding to the molecular weight of 75,800 (Fig. 2E). These results suggest that Hjm exists as a monomeric protein in solution. Further analyses including analytical ultracentrifugation will provide more detailed information.Fig. 2Production and purification of Hjm protein in E. coli cells.A, purified Hjm protein (F, 0.4 μg) was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue. B, P. furiosus cell extract (800 ng) and purified recombinant Hjm protein (1 ng) were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and detected by anti-Hjm sera using a chemiluminescence system. C, identification of Hjm in the cation chromatography fractions corresponding to the branch migration activity. Western blot analysis was done using the MonoS column fractions, as shown in Fig. 1B. D, gel filtration analysis. Gel filtration chromatography was performed by a SMART system equipped with a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30. Aliquots of the fractions were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE analysis followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The peak positions of the marker proteins, immunoglobulin G (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), and myoglobin (17 kDa), eluted from the column are shown by arrows at the top. E, glycerol gradient centrifugation analysis. Hjm protein was sedimented for 24 h at 4 °C through 10–35% glycerol gradient. The standard curve was obtained by marker proteins on a parallel gradient.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Biochemical Characterization of Hjm—Using purified Hjm protein, its HJ unwinding activity was characterized in more detail. Hjm dissociated the synthetic HJ, HSL, in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro as shown in Fig. 3A. Thermus thermophilus RuvB and RuvA-RuvB complex were used for the same assay to compare the efficiencies of the unwinding reaction. The Hjm dissociated the synthetic HJ, HSL DNA, to two splayed arms at lower concentrations (3–10 nm). In the higher concentrations (>10 nm), Hjm dissociated HSL DNA very efficiently, and in these cases, approximately half of the splayed arms DNA was dissociated to single-stranded DNAs (Fig. 3). In the same unwinding assay, T. thermophilus RuvAB, with 200 nm as RuvB monomer concentration, dissociated 34% of HLS to two splayed arms in 30 min. With the same concentration of the proteins, Hjm showed more efficient dissociation of HSL DNA (Fig. 3B). This dissolving activity was ATP-dependent (Fig. 4A). However, some reaction products were observed in the reactions with ADP and ATPγS. Further investigations should be done to confirm that these nucleotides actually work for the reaction. The reaction was most efficient with an ATP concentration of at ∼5–10 mm (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, the HJ were dissociated to single-stranded DNA with increasing concentrations of ATP. A divalent cation was also essential for the junction dissolving reaction, and Mg2+ worked most efficiently among five kinds of metal cations (Fig. 4B). In the case of MgCl2, the reaction progressed well with less than 10 mm MgCl2 (Fig. 4C). This junction dissolving activity was quite sensitive to the salt concentration, because the reaction was inhibited with increasing concentrations of NaCl (Fig. 4D). In addition to these properties, Hjm is very heat-stable. No activity was lost even after an incubation of the protein at 98 °C for 90 min (data not shown). The optimal temperature of the junction dissolving reaction was difficult to determine, because the synthetic four-way junction substrates were disrupted at higher temperatures. However, the dissolving reaction was observed at least at 80 °C (data not shown).Fig. 3Branch migration activity of the purified Hjm protein. Recombinant Hjm protein with the indicated concentrations was incubated with 5 nm of 32P-labeled HSL, 35 bp arms with a 30-bp homologous core, and the reactions were carried out at 55 °C for 30 min. T. thermophilus RuvB and the RuvA-RuvB complex, with the indicated concentrations of each monomer protein, was used for control reactions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Requirements for Hjm branch migration activity.A"

We previously reported that urokinase potentiates cell migration in human airway smooth muscle cells only where there is some primary migratory stimulus such as PDGF or recent exposure to growth medium. In this study, we examined the signaling of urokinase through its receptor, which lacks an intracellular domain and is presumed to act through associations with other membrane proteins. Whereas PDGF (30 min) and PDGF with urokinase increased the amount of the tyrosine dephosphorylase SHP2 in the membrane fraction, urokinase alone (30 min) decreased membrane SHP2. Analysis of the time course of urokinase stimulation showed that SHP2 was brought into association with the urokinase receptor uPAR between 2.5 and 20 min of urokinase, and later dissociated from it. Focal adhesion kinase was steadily lost from association with uPAR during urokinase stimulation, but its phosphorylation state increased and it became cleaved to smaller molecules. Association of uPAR with caveolin also decreased during urokinase stimulation. In contrast, the tyrosine kinase Src increased in the membrane fraction in response to urokinase stimulation. Disruption of raft structures by cyclodextrin treatment led to potentiation of PDGF chemotaxis, similar to urokinase action. Blocking of dephosphorylase activity with vanadate reduced basal cell migration and blocked the action of urokinase on PDGF chemotaxis. These observations support a role for urokinase in altering the phosphorylation state of focal adhesions, leading to breakdown of their structure and facilitation of cell motility.-Carlin, S. M., Resink, T. J., Tamm, M., Roth, M. Urokinase signal transduction and its role in cell migration."

Since there is no naturally occurring prostate cancer in the mouse, preclinical studies stipulate for the establishment of a genetically manipulated mouse CaP model with features close to the human situation. In view of the limitations of transgenic technique-derived CaP models, herein we report the first application of knockin technology to establish a new mouse adenocarcinoma prostate model (PSP-KIMAP) by targeting of SV40 Tag to a prostate tissue-specific gene, PSP94 (prostate secretory protein of 94 amino acids). In order to demonstrate its novelty, we compared KIMAP to a PSP94 gene-directed transgenic mouse adenocarcinoma of the prostate (PSP-TGMAP) model. The CaP development of the PSP-KIMAP mice started almost immediately after puberty at 10 weeks of age from mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN) with microinvasion to well-differentiated CaP, and demonstrated a close-to-human kinetics of prolonged tumor growth and a predominance of well and moderately differentiated tumors. The invasive nature of KIMAP model was demonstrated by multitissue metastases (lymph node, lung and liver etc) and also by immunohistochemical study of multiple invasive prostate tumor markers. PSP-KIMAP model is responsive to androgen deprivation (castration). The knockin technology in our KIMAP model demonstrates highly predictive CaP development procedures and many advantageous features, which the traditional transgenic technique-derived CaP models could not reach for both basic and clinical studies. These features include the high stability of both phenotype and genotype, highly synchronous prostate cancer development, high and precise prostate tissue targeting and with no founder line variation. The differences between the two CaP models were attributed to the introduction of a single endogenous knockin mutation, resulting in a CaP model self-regulated and controlled by a prostate gene promoter/enhancer of PSP94."
https://openalex.org/W2057411426,"Tyrosinase is a type I membrane protein regulating the pigmentation process in humans. Mutations of the human tyrosinase gene cause the tyrosinase negative type I oculocutaneous albinism (OCAI). Some OCAI mutations were shown to delete the transmembrane domain or to affect its hydrophobic properties, resulting in soluble tyrosinase mutants that are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To understand the specific mechanisms involved in the ER retention of soluble tyrosinase, we have constructed a tyrosinase mutant truncated at its C-terminal end and investigated its maturation process. The mutant is retained in the ER, and it is degraded through the proteasomal pathway. We determined that the mannose trimming is required for an efficient degradation process. Moreover, this soluble ER-associated degradation substrate is stopped at the ER quality control checkpoint with no requirements for an ER-Golgi recycling pathway. Co-immmunoprecipitation experiments showed that soluble tyrosinase interacts with calreticulin and BiP/GRP78 (and not calnexin) during its ER transit. Expression of soluble tyrosinase in calreticulin-deficient cells resulted in the export of soluble tyrosinase of the ER, indicating the calreticulin role in ER retention.

These lectin chaperones engage the chains into the de-glucosylation/re-glucosylation cycle catalyzed by glucosidase II and glucosyltransferase, with the latter recognizing only incompletely, folded chains. Although the correctly folded polypeptides leave the cycle and the ER, the incompletely folded ones are re-glucosylated and retrieved by calnexin/calreticulin (12.Zapun A. Petrescu S.M. Rudd P.M.

Both lectins bind to membrane and soluble glycoproteins, but calreticulin was proposed to bind preferentially to soluble substrates. In general, the role of calreticulin has been largely overlooked, because until recently, it was assumed that the two lectins can substitute for each other in the ER quality control (14.Molinari M.

This cycle is also believed to be effective in the case of some albino tyrosinases (8.Halaban R. Svedine S. Cheng E. Smicun Y. Aron R. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although many of them are clustered in the lumenal domain, a number of mutations were found to affect, directly or indirectly, the transmembrane domain of tyrosinase. Thus, a base insertion within the TM domain resulting in a dramatic reduction of its hydrophobicity leads to an albino tyrosinase (3.Chintamaneni C.D. Halaban R. Kobayashi Y. Witkop Jr., C.J. Kwon B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5272-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).

It has been proposed that these mutations would interfere with the insertion of tyrosinase into the membrane, hence impairing the whole pigmentation process. Breimer et al. (17.Breimer L.H.

Because the patients also showed a mutation at codon 422, the temperature sensitive phenotype was associated with the point mutation previously reported to result in a similar phenotype (20.Giebel L.B. Strunk K.M. Spritz R.A. Genomics. 1991; 9: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Berson et al. (21.Berson J.F. Frank D.W. Calvo P.A. Bieler B.M. Marks M.S. J. Biol.

All of the above OCAI frameshift mutations introducing termination codons, which either delete or decrease the hydrophobicity of the single TM domain, are associated with a complete absence of tyrosinase activity (3.Chintamaneni C.D.

Although these studies indicate the ER retention of different forms of truncated tyrosinases as the cause of albinism, the molecular basis for this ER retention has not been addressed as yet. Herein, the ER maturation pathway of a human soluble tyrosinase construct was investigated. We found that, unlike wild type, the truncated tyrosinase did not associate significantly with calnexin, being retained in the ER by calreticulin and BiP/GRP78. This tyrosinase mutant is an ERAD substrate that does not require ER-Golgi transport and retrieval for degradation. Our findings qualify calreticulin as a major component in the ER retention of albino C-terminally truncated tyrosinases.

The construct pTriEX1.1-E2HCV was a kind gift from Dr. Olivier Argaut (Oxford University, Oxford, UK), and the pTriEX1.1-TYRΔ7 was a gift from Viorica Lastun (Institute of Biochemistry, Bucharest, Romania). Rabbit anti-calreticulin (calregulin C-17) antiserum was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit anti-BiP (anti-Grp78) antiserum was from Stressgen (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). [35S]Methionine/cysteine (Tran35S-label, specific radioactivity 1100 Ci/mmol) was from MP Biomedicals (Asse-Relegem, Belgium). CHAPS was from Pierce. Lactacystin, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (LLN) and kifunensin were from Calbiochem. Nocodazole, bafilomycin, and all other chemicals were from Sigma. Human Tyrosinase Constructs—Full-length cDNA coding for human tyrosinase in the cloning vector pcTyr was a kind gift from Dr. V. J. Hearing (NCI, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD). The full-length human tyrosinase was amplified by PCR from pcTyr using the primers: TYRF1, 5′-GCTATACCATGGCCCTCCTGGCTGTTTTG-3′ and TYRR1, 5′–GGCGCGCCTCGAGTAAATGGCTCTGATA-3′. The resulting PCR product was digested with NcoI and XhoI and was cloned in-frame with the eight histidines of pTriEX-1.1 (Novagen EMD Biosciences) into the corresponding sites of pTriEX-1 to generate pTriEX-1.1-TYR. Tyrosinase lumenal domain cDNA was generated by PCR using pcTyr as a template and the following primers: TYRF1 (shown above) and STYRR1, 5′-GTATTCTCGAGCCGACTCGCTTGTTC-3′. The resulting PCR product was cloned in pTriEX-1.1 in the same way as WT tyrosinase to generate pTriEX-1.1-STYR truncated at the 474 codon. Each sequence was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing at the DNA sequencing unit of the Department of Biochemistry, Oxford University, Oxford, UK. Transfection of Cells and Metabolic Labeling—Constructs were transiently transfected in B16F1, HEK293T, CHO, MEF crt–/–, and wild type MEF cells. Semiconfluent cells grown for 1 day in 6-well dishes were used to transiently express tyrosinase cDNAs (1 μg of DNA/well) using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). To ensure similar transfection efficiency for all samples, transfection with pTriEX-1.1-TYR and pTriEX-1.1-STYR was performed at the same time using aliquots of the same cells. Cells were analyzed 24 h after transfection. For metabolic labeling, transfected cells (107 cells/ml) were starved in the cysteine/methionine-free medium for 1 h, pulse labeled with 100–150 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine for 20 min, and chased for the times specified (Figs. 1, 3, 4, 5). In some experiments, lactacystin, LLN, nocodazole (20 μm, stock solutions dissolved in Me2SO), kifunensin (20 nm, stock solution in Me2SO), NB-DNJ (5 mm, stock solution in PBS), and bafilomycin (100 nm, stock solution in Me2SO) were added to the medium during starvation and maintained during the pulse and chase period. Immediately after chase, the cells were harvested in cold PBS. The cells were then lysed with CHAPS lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 2% CHAPS, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.5% protease inhibitor mixture containing leupeptin, aprotinin, sodium EDTA, bestatin, AEBSF, and E-64) for 1 h on ice. When the samples were to be used for immunoprecipitation of BiP/GRP78, the cells were lysed in the presence of 20 units/ml apyrase (to enzymatically deplete ATP).Fig. 3Soluble tyrosinase is an ERAD substrate. A, cells transfected with pTriEx-1.1-STYR were pulse-chased for 0 and 3 h in the absence (Control) and presence of lactacystin (Lac), N-acetyl-leucylleucyl-norleucinal (LLN), kifunensin (Kif), bafilomycin (Baf) and nocodazole (Noc), lysed, and immunoprecipitated with anti-tyrosinase antibody.

TYRΔ7 was detected with anti-tyrosinase antibody and E2 with A-11 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE—[35S]-labeled cell lysates were centrifuged and supernatants were incubated with T 311 antibodies (1:50) overnight at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose and further incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. The slurry was washed three times with 0.5% CHAPS in HEPES buffer. Tyrosinase was eluted by boiling the slurry for 5 min in SDS sample buffer with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. Chaperone co-immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (24.Branza-Nichita N. Negroiu G. Petrescu A.J. Garman E.F. Platt F.M. Wormald M.R. Dwek R.A. Petrescu S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8169-8175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-calnexin, anti-calreticulin, or anti-BiP/GRP78 antibodies, and the washed slurry was eluted with 1% SDS, diluted ten times with lysis buffer, and re-precipitated with T311 antibodies. The bound proteins were eluted in reducing conditions and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gels were visualized by autoradiography. Relevant bands were quantified by scanning densitometry. EndoH Digestions—Immunoprecipitated [35S]-labeled samples were eluted from protein A-Sepharose slurry in EndoH denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS 1% 2-mercaptoethanol) by incubation for 5 min at 100 °C. The samples were cooled and mixed with 1/10 EndoH reaction buffer (0.5 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5). 500 units of EndoH (1 μl) was added to one-half of the amount of each sample, whereas the other half contained EndoH buffers alone. The digested samples, together with non-digested controls, were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. In Western blotting experiments, cell lysates containing 20 μg of protein were denatured in the EndoH denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol) for 5 min at 100 °C, cooled, and mixed with 1 μl of EndoH or reaction buffer. Immunoblotting—Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and lysed in CHAPS lysis buffer. The proteins from transfected lysed cells were electrophoretically separated in 10% acrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon membrane (Amersham International, Amersham, UK). Blots were incubated with a 1:200 dilution of anti-tyrosinase antibody (T311) in 1% milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by sheep anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactivity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescent Western blotting (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunofluorescence—B16F1 cells were plated on coverslips and transfected with pTriEx-1.1-TYR and pTriEx-1.1-STYR using the method specified above. After 24 h, the cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed and permeabilized with methanol at –20 °C for 5 min. Some cells were incubated with 20 μm nocodazole for 3 h before fixation. In that case, the control untreated cells were incubated for the same period with the appropriate dilution of Me2SO. After washing eight times in PBS, the cells were incubated with the primary antibodies T311 (1:250), anti-CNX (1:300), and anti-ERGIC-53 (1:100) diluted in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Following three washes with PBS, they were further incubated with the appropriate Alexa 488 or 594 conjugated secondary antibodies (1:400) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the cells, washed three times with PBS, were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and viewed with a Nikon Eclipse E 600 fluorescent microscope. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 software. Soluble Tyrosinase Is Retained in the ER of Melanocytic and Non-melanocytic Cells—Constitutively synthesized only by melanocytes and melanoma cells, wild type tyrosinase is localized in specialized organelles named melanosomes. With melanin being synthesized exclusively in melanosomes, sequestration of tyrosinase in any pre-melanosomal compartment leads to an albino phenotype. To study the intracellular localization of a soluble albino tyrosinase, we have constructed a mutant truncated at the 474 codon and expressed it in the mouse melanoma cell line B16F1. Both wild type and truncated tyrosinase were transiently transfected and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1A). It can be seen that wild type tyrosinase displays mainly a distinct punctate cytoplasmic pattern visible also along the dendrites, consistent with an intracellular vesicular distribution specific to a melanosome. Some of the protein displays a perinuclear staining co-localizing with the ER resident protein calnexin. In contrast, soluble tyrosinase is massively co-localized with calnexin, suggesting an ER localization. This has been previously shown for a soluble tyrosinase truncated at the 444 codon and expressed in HeLa cells (21.Berson J.F. Frank D.W. Calvo P.A. Bieler B.M. Marks M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12281-12289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Although the two tyrosinases were truncated at different codon positions, they displayed similar ER localizations, indicating that truncations occurring ahead of the TM domain result in ER retention. Next, to confirm the immunofluorescence localization, transiently transfected B16F1 cells were characterized by Western blotting (Fig. 1B). Cell lysates were divided in two, and half of each sample was digested with EndoH and run next to a non-digested control in reducing SDS-PAGE. Digestion with EndoH, which removed high mannose and hybrid N-glycans, resulted in a soluble tyrosinase form running as a single band at ∼50–54 kDa, the expected size of the truncated tyrosinase estimated at 54 kDa (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the wild type tyrosinase was expressed as two glycoforms, one EndoH-resistant and one EndoH-sensitive running at ∼58–60 kDa, corresponding to the polypeptide (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the ectopical expression of human wild type tyrosinase in B16F1 cells results in a protein able to exit the ER in a proportion of 38% (Fig. 1C) and to be transported through the secretory pathway. In the same system, truncation of the TM domain dramatically decreases the proportion of the ER-exported form, confirming the ER localization observed by immunofluorescence. To address the possibility that this behavior is specific only to melanocytes, we expressed soluble tyrosinase in two non-melanocytic cell lines, CHO and HEK293. As seen in Fig. 1B, we found a similar EndoH pattern as that found in melanocytes. We were not able to detect soluble tyrosinase in the medium of the tested cells referred to above (data not shown). Our results show that the soluble tyrosinase mutant remains in the ER of melanocytic and non-melanocytic cells, consistent with a similar localization of a soluble tyrosinase expressed in HeLa cells (21.Berson J.F. Frank D.W. Calvo P.A. Bieler B.M. Marks M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12281-12289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To compare the time course maturation of wild type and soluble tyrosinases, we performed a pulse-chase experiment in B16F1-transfected cells. The cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 20 min followed by chase for time periods up to 2 h. Immunoprecipitation of the labeled cell lysates with T311 anti-tyrosinase antibodies was followed by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1C). The mock immunoprecipitation in non-transfected B16F1 cells show the absence of nonspecific bands (Fig. 1C). After a 30-min lag period, a gradual reduction in the amount of the labeled immunoprecipitated soluble and wild type protein was observed during the chase. In cells transfected with ST, digestion with EndoH reduced the pool to a band running at the polypeptide mass (Fig. 1C). As shown by EndoH digestion experiments, WT is synthesized as a high mannose precursor that acquires complex-type glycans in the Golgi in ∼30 min of chase and is degraded rapidly during 2 h of chase (Fig. 1C). As reported previously (8.Halaban R. Svedine S. Cheng E. Smicun Y. Aron R. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5889-5894Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), a significant population (62%) of the labeled WT remains EndoH-sensitive, indicating a reduced level of productive folding of this protein (Fig. 1D). Although membrane tyrosinase has a half-life of 1.8 h, soluble tyrosinase degrades with a half-life of 1.5 h. Because the half-life of the ER-retained WT (WT-sensitive, >2 h) is at least twice as high as the one of the secreted population (WT-resistant, 1 h), we analyzed the two populations separately. As seen in Fig. 1D, the WT-sensitive population degrades slower than the soluble tyrosinase population. Although it has been proposed that soluble tyrosinase behaves like the WT-sensitive form of the membrane tyrosinase (21.Berson J.F. Frank D.W. Calvo P.A. Bieler B.M. Marks M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12281-12289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), our degradation kinetics studies indicate an accelerated degradation of the soluble tyrosinase mutant versus the ER-retained form of membrane tyrosinase. This prompted us to investigate further the degradation pathways of soluble tyrosinase. Soluble Tyrosinase Is an ERAD Substrate—Proteins that are not able to fold correctly are stopped by the ER quality control checkpoint in the ER and targeted to degradation. These ERAD substrates are retrotranslocated in the cytoplasm and degraded in proteasomes. Sometimes the misfolded proteins require transport to the early Golgi and retrieval to the ER prior to degradation (25.Ahner A. Brodsky J.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 474-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To determine whether soluble tyrosinase is an ERAD substrate, we first asked the question as to whether its ER retention was a true ER retention or was the result of exit and retrieva"

We performed yeast two-hybrid screening to identify new binding partners of the activated gp130 and the associated Janus kinases. LMO4, a LIM domain-containing protein that belongs to a family of oncogenes, was identified in this assay. Further studies show that LMO4 associates with gp130 and Janus kinase1 in several mammalian cell types. It also interacts with protein-tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3). The binding domains involved in these interactions were mapped, and the interactions were shown to be in a direct manner by in vitro binding assays. It is likely that LMO4 exists in the gp130 complex. The cellular localization of LMO4 was detected primarily in the nucleus with a substantial amount also detected in the cytoplasm in several cell types. The effect of LMO4 in IL-6 signaling was subsequently examined. Overexpression of LMO4 enhanced the transcriptional activity and target gene expression of Stat 3 (signal transducers and activators of transcription 3). Consistent with this, silencing LMO4 expression in stable cell lines expressing the small interfering RNA of LMO4 decreased Stat3 activity. Furthermore, the half-life of gp130 was shortened, and the production of acute phase proteins induced by IL-6 was reduced. Together, our data reveal a positive regulatory role of LMO4 in IL-6 signaling, possibly by acting as a scaffold for stabilization of the gp130 complex. These studies may open up a link between the oncogenic effect of LMO proteins and their regulatory role in cytokine signaling in general.

Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 249-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 2.Hibi M. Nakajima K. Hirano T. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). IL-6 regulates the production of acute phase proteins in hepatocytes and stimulates differentiation of B and T cells and proliferation of keratinocytes, mesangial, and myeloma/plasmacytoma cells. The IL-6 cytokine family transduces their signals via a common receptor subunit, glycoprotein 130 (gp130). In the case of IL-6, binding of the ligand to the non-signaling α-receptor subunit recruits the β-receptor subunits, gp130, which form homodimers. The receptor dimerization leads to phosphorylation and activation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinases of the JAK family that are pre-associated with gp130. JAKs in turn phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic portion of gp130, which serve as docking sites for signaling molecules containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. Six tyrosine residues are phosphorylated in gp130 upon ligand stimulation, leading to the activation of two major pathways (for viewed, see Ref. 3.Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2503) Google Scholar). The four phosphotyrosine residues at the C-terminal region of gp130 serve as recruitment sites for Stat3 (4.Ihle J.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation of its second membrane-proximal tyrosine residue leads to recruitment of SHP2 (3.Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2503) Google Scholar). SHP2 serves as an adaptor protein mediating the activation of the Ras-Rafmitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. As a protein-tyrosine phosphatase, SHP2 also plays a negative regulatory role in IL-6 signaling (5.Schaper F. Gendo C. Eck M. Schmitz J. Grimm C. Anhuf D. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 6.Kim H. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5326-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The same site also mediates binding of the IL-6-induced feedback inhibitor SOCS3, which attenuates IL-6 signaling by inhibiting JAKs as well as by triggering protein degradation (7.Fischer P.

The LIM domain, characterized by a double zinc finger structure, was originally identified in the homeodomain transcription factors Lin-11, Isl-1, and Mec-3, which have established roles in the central nervous system, and was subsequently found in a variety of proteins with diverse functions. The LIM-containing proteins consist of two or more LIM domains, which either occur by themselves or in association with other functional domains such as protein kinase (Lim kinases) or homeobox (LHX proteins) domains (9.Dawid I.B. Breen J.J. Toyama R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 156-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 10.Sanchez-Garcia I. Rabbitts T.H. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 315-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The LIM domain does not directly bind to DNA; instead, they function by mediating multiple protein-protein interactions (11.Bach I. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 12.Jurata L.W. Gill G.N. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 75-113PubMed Google Scholar). The LIM-only (LMO) is a subfamily of LIM-containing proteins consisting of four members, designated LMO1-LMO4. This subfamily is almost entirely composed of tandem LIM domains. LMO1 and LMO2 were initially identified as T cell oncogenes by virtue of their translocation in acute T cell leukemia (13.Rabbitts T.H. Nature. 1994; 372: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). LMO4 is the most recently described family member that was isolated by its interaction with the ubiquitous adaptor protein Ldb (LIM-domain binding protein 1), also known as NLI1 and CLIM2, and in an expression screen with autologous serum from a breast cancer patient (14.Kenny D.A.

In addition to Ldb1, several interacting proteins, including deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor-1 (Deaf-1), CtBP-interacting protein, breast cancer autoantigen1 (BRCA1), Grainyhead-like epithelial transactivator (GET-1), and the basic helix-loop-helix protein HEN-1, have been described for LMO4 (15.Sugihara T.M.

Most of them are nuclear proteins, underlining its function as a transcriptional co-activator or repressor. However, whether LMO proteins interact with non-nuclear proteins or have other functions has not been reported. Because gp130 is a common receptor subunit shared by all IL-6 type cytokines and is the center for formation of the receptor complex, we sought to identify other proteins that interact with gp130 and play regulatory roles in IL-6 signaling. We found that LMO4 interacts with gp130 and JAKs, which further promotes IL-6-stimulated activation of Stat3 and its target gene expression, probably via stabilizing the gp130 complex. LMO4 also interacts with SHP2 and SOCS3. Based on our results, we propose a novel positive regulatory role of LMO4 in IL-6 signaling. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The intracellular domain of murine gp130 comprising 275 amino acids was amplified with primers containing a 5′ XhoI and a 3′ XmaI restriction enzyme sites. The C-terminal 284 amino acids of the murine Jak2 JH1 domain were amplified with primers containing a 5′ XmaI and a 3′ KpnI site. The resulting fragments were digested with XmaI, ligated, and used as a template to PCR-amplify the fusion protein, which was also inserted into the pXJ40-FLAG-tagged vector for mammalian expression. This construct was further used as a template for PCR amplifications with primers containing a 5′ EcoRI and a 3′ SalI site to be cloned into the pGBKT7 vector containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain as bait. This plasmid was transformed into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109, and a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using a embryonic mouse MATCHMAKER cDNA library from E11 (Clontech) as described previously (21.Lufei C. Ma J. Huang G. Zhang T. Novotny-Diermayr V. Ong C.T. Cao X. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Construction of Plasmids—The LMO4 expression plasmid was obtained by PCR amplification from a mouse embryonic cDNA library. It was inserted into the pXJ40-hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged vector or the pXJ40-Myc-tagged vector (22.Ma J. Zhang T. Novotny-Diermayr V. Tan A.L. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29252-29260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Human SOCS3 was PCR-amplified from IL-6-induced HepG2 cell cDNA and inserted into the pXJ40-FLAG-tagged vector. GST fusion constructs of murine LMO4 or human SOCS3 were generated by PCR using the wild type plasmid as a template and were introduced into the pXJ40-GST vector via a 5′ BamHI and a 3′ XhoI site. The human Jak1 and SHP2 constructs were obtained from I. Kerr and B. C. Low, respectively, and used as a template in PCR to amplify the different deletion constructs using a 5′ XhoI and a 3′ KpnI (for Jak1) or a 5′ BamHI and a 3′ XhoI primer (for SHP2) to re-insert the amplicons into the pXJ40-Myc-tagged vector. All PCR products were subsequently sequenced. siRNA constructs targeting LMO4 were designed using Ambion siRNA target finder, and oligos were introduced into the pSilencer 2.1-U6 neo (Ambion). The target sequence for t14 was 5′-aatggcagtttattttgtgaa-3′ and for t17 was 5′-aattcacttcagagcaatcca-3′. All constructs were verified by subsequent sequencing. Cell Culture and Cell Transfections—The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 and the African green monkey fibroblasts COS-1 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described previously (22.Ma J. Zhang T. Novotny-Diermayr V. Tan A.L. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29252-29260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Jurkat T-cells, 293T cells, and T47D human mammary epithelial cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ng/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. The medium for T47D cells contained additional 10 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.3) and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected in serum free medium using either FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) for most experiments or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for reporter gene assays and COS-1 transfections, following the manufacturer's instructions. All cells were maintained in growth medium with 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 36 h before stimulation. When required, cells were stimulated using 40 ng/ml human IL-6 (Peprotech). Stably transfected HepG2 cells with siRNA constructs were selected and maintained in growth medium containing 900 and 700 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against HA epitope, Myc tag, SHP2, SOCS3, Jak1, Jak2, gp130, Stat3, the goat polyclonal antibodies against SOCS3 and LMO4, the normal rabbit IgG, monoclonal antibodies against SHP2, HA and Myc epitope were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against LMO4 was obtained from Chemicon, and the chicken polyclonal antibody to LMO4 was purchased from Abcam. The monoclonal antibodies against Jak1, GST, and Stat3 were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. The pY705-specific antibody for Stat3 was obtained from Cell Signaling, and the phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnologies. The horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody against the S™ tag was acquired from Novagen. Antibodies against actin and the FLAG tag (M2) and the secondary antibodies against rabbit and mouse antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Sigma. The horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies against goat IgG and chicken IgY were obtained from DakoCytomation and Abcam, respectively. The anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies coupled to alkaline phosphatase were acquired from Cell Signaling. Immunoprecipitation (IP), GST Pull Down, and Immunoblotting—IP of the total cell lysate was performed as described previously (21.Lufei C. Ma J. Huang G. Zhang T. Novotny-Diermayr V. Ong C.T. Cao X. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Signals were normally detected with ECL (Amersham Biosciences) or CDP-Star (New England Biolabs) for alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibodies. For weak signals, the Lumilight detection system from Roche Diagnostics was used. GST pull down was performed as described (23.Novotny-Diermayr V. Zhang T. Gu L. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49134-49142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Blots were stripped using the Restore™ buffer from Pierce, according to the manufacturer's instructions, before being reprobed. In Vitro Binding Assays—For each reaction, 0.5 μg of Myc- or GST-tagged plasmid DNA were used to produce proteins in vitro with the TNT T7Quick-coupled transcription and translation kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The recombinant bacterial protein, gp130-ID, was produced and purified as described earlier (23.Novotny-Diermayr V. Zhang T. Gu L. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49134-49142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The proteins were mixed with a TNT reaction from 0.5 μg of HA-tagged LMO4 plasmid DNA in a total volume of 500 μl of RIPA buffer (or PBS for gp130-ID) with protease inhibitors (1 tablet of Complete Mini EDTA-free from Roche Diagnostics per 10 ml of RIPA buffer/PBS) and 10 μg of polyclonal serum against the HA tag. After rotation at 4 °C, 50 μl of a 50% protein A-agarose slurry were added and incubated for 1 h before washing. The precipitates were eluted in 2× Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to Western blotting. Northern Blot Analysis—HepG2 cells were either untreated or treated with 20 ng/ml human IL-6 for 8 h. Total RNA was prepared using TRIZOL® (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 30 μg of total RNA were separated on a denaturing gel and transferred to a Hybond™-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences). To generate the radiolabeled probes, cDNA from HepG2 cells induced for 2 h was used. The following primers were used to amplify fragments of about 300–400 bp in length: for haptoglobin (5′-ctcaaacagaaggtgtctgttaatgag-3′ and 5′-cttggtacttagacatgccagcacaga-3′) and for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (5′-ggtgaaggtcggagtcaacggatttg-3′ and 5′-ggctgttgtcatacttctcatggttc-3′). Probes were generated using the Rediprime™ II random prime labeling system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions using [32P]dCTP. Prehybridization (for 2 h) and hybridization (overnight) were carried out at 68 °C using ExpressHyb™ hybridization solution (Clontech) with the addition of 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA (Sigma). Blots were washed in 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) containing 0.05% SDS for ∼1 h at room temperature and exposed to film. Immunofluorescence—HepG2 or T47D cells were grown on coverslips. HepG2 cells were fixed with a freshly prepared 3.7% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS containing 0.18% Triton X-100. T47D cells were fixed with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution containing 0.1% TritonX-100 for 25 min and were subsequently incubated with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Blocking and incubation with HA antibody, the rabbit anti-LMO4 antiserum, or the chicken anti-LMO4 followed by incubation with Cy3-coupled secondary antibodies (1:200) against rabbit IgG (Chemicon) or chicken IgY (Abcam) were carried out in PBS supplemented with 5% normal goat serum, 2% fetal bovine serum, and 2% bovine serum albumin. After washing, cells were incubated with 1:2000 diluted TOPRO3 (Molecular Probes) for 10 min before mounting in an anti-fade medium (Gel/Mount™, Biomeda) and examination with a confocal microscope (MRC 1024 or Radiance 2000, Bio-Rad). The figures were processed with Adobe Photoshop software. Reporter Gene Assays—The firefly luciferase reporter gene constructs pGL3-m67 high affinity sis-inducible element (24.Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) and the pGL3-α2M-215luc were kind gifts from Dr. J. Bromberg and Dr. P. C. Heinrich, respectively. The luciferase assays were carried out as described previously (21.Lufei C. Ma J. Huang G. Zhang T. Novotny-Diermayr V. Ong C.T. Cao X. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To check the expression of LMO4 the total cell lysates (TCL) of two replicas were lysed in RIPA buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Identification of LMO4 as an Interacting Protein of gp130 and Jaks—To identify new proteins that may modulate gp130-mediated IL-6 signaling, we generated a fusion gene containing the intracytoplasmic domain of gp130 and the catalytic domain JH1 (the Janus homology domain 1) of Jak2 and used it as bait in yeast two-hybrid screening. The fusion protein (gp130-JH1) was strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated when expressed in yeast since the JH1 domain alone has been shown to have high enzymatic activity (25.Saharinen P. Vihinen M. Silvennoinen O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This fusion protein was expected to mimic the activated gp130-Jak complex. Two positive clones were identified to encode the full-length murine LMO4. We first confirmed the specificity of this interaction in yeast (data not shown) and next analyzed the interaction in mammalian cells. For this purpose, HA-tagged LMO4 and the FLAG-tagged fusion protein gp130-JH1 or gp130 and JH1 alone were transiently expressed in mammalian 293T epithelial cells. The protein-protein interaction was analyzed by immunoprecipitation/Western blot (IP/Blot) assay. We found that LMO4 co-immunoprecipitated with gp130-JH1 fusion protein as well as gp130 or JH1 alone but not with the vector control (Fig. 1A), indicating LMO4 may interact with both gp130 and Jak2. We further examined whether LMO4 interacted with the full-length Jak2 as well as Jak1, because although gp130 binds to Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2, Jak1 activity is predominant in IL-6 signaling (26.Guschin D. Rogers N. Briscoe J. Witthuhn B. Watling D. Horn F. Pellegrini S. Yasukawa K. Heinrich P. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 27.Rodig S.J. Meraz M.A. White J.M. Lampe P.A. Riley J.K. Arthur C.D. King K.L. Sheehan K.C. Yin L. Pennica D. Johnson Jr., E.M. Schreiber R.D. Cell. 1998; 93: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Our results showed that both Jak1 and Jak2 could co-precipitate with Myc-tagged LMO4 in COS-1 cells (and 293T cells, data not shown). Reciprocally, we also detected LMO4 co-immunoprecipitated with Jak1 and Jak2 (Fig. 1B). We further investigated whether the observed interactions occurred under physiological conditions. Two sets of experiments were conducted. First, we used the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 that expresses gp130 and Jak1 in relatively high levels to overexpress HA-tagged LMO4 to observe its interaction with the endogenous gp130 and Jak1 under either unstimulated conditions or stimulated with IL-6. As seen in Fig. 2A, association between HA-LMO4 and both Jak1 and gp130 was detected in the unstimulated cells and further enhanced in the IL-6-stimulated cells. LMO4 has been shown to be highly expressed in brain, thymus, and also in several breast cancer cell lines (28.Wittlin S. Sum E.Y. Jonas N.K. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Genomics. 2003; 82: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Next, to further show that this interaction also occurs with the endogenous proteins, we chose the Jurkat T cell line and the breast cancer cell line T47D. We detected strong co-immunoprecipitation between the endogenous LMO4 with Jak1 and gp130 in both cell lines under normal growth conditions (Fig. 2B). LMO4 did not co-precipitate with the control rabbit IgG, indicating the interaction was specific. We then examined whether the interaction between the endogenous proteins was regulated by IL-6. We observed that although the association between the endogenous LMO4 and Jak1 was enhanced by IL-6, association of LMO4 with gp130 was not further increased by IL-6 in the T47D cells (Fig. 2C). We also examined whether LMO4 interacted with Stat3 in these two cell types. We did not observe such interaction in Jurkat cells under normal growth conditions nor in the T47D cells either unstimulated or stimulated by IL-6 (Fig. 2, B and C). This result supported the specificity of LMO4 interaction with gp130 and Jak1. Together, these data suggest that the endogenous LMO4 constitutively associates with gp130 and Jak1. Although we could not detect significant enhancement of such interaction at the endogenous level by IL-6 stimulation, we did observe that the interactions of gp130 and Jak1 with the exogenous LMO4 were increased. LMO4 Also Binds to SHP2 and SOCS3—Proteins containing Lim domains are generally regarded as mediators of protein-protein interactions by acting as scaffolds or molecular adapters linking proteins of various types together (9.Dawid I.B. Breen J.J. Toyama R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 156-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 11.Bach I. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). We investigated if other proteins known to associate with Jak1/gp130 also bound to LMO4. SHP2 is known to bind to pY759 of the human gp130 receptor subunit after IL-6 induction. Indeed, we could detect a strong binding between the transfected HA-LMO4 and the endogenous SHP2 in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, an association of endogenous LMO4 with SHP2 was also detectable in both HepG2 and T47D cells, although this interaction was not enhanced by IL-6 treatment. The lack of co-immunoprecipitation of LMO4 with control IgG indicated the specificity of the interaction (Fig. 3B). The same residue (Tyr(P)-759) of gp130 also provides a docking site for the IL-6-induced feedback inhibitor, SOCS3. When overexpressing both HA-LMO4 and FLAG-tagged SOCS3 in COS-1 cells, we could also see the interaction of these two proteins (Fig. 3C). It has been known that the expression of the endogenous SOCS3 is IL-6-inducible in various cell types. We detected the endogenous SOCS3 in the HepG2 cells treated with IL-6 for 60 min, as expected (Fig. 3D, top panel). Furthermore, this induced SOCS3 could interact with the endogenous LMO4 but not the control IgG (middle panel). Together, these results show that LMO4 interacts with SHP2 and SOCS3 as well. LMO4 Exists as a Component of the gp130 Complex in IL-6 Signaling—It has been shown that Jak1 constitutively associates with the gp130 receptor, and SHP2 and SOCS3 associate with gp130 when induced by IL-6. The results described above raise a possibility that LMO4 may not interact with gp130, Jak1, SHP2, and SOCS3 individually but is present in the gp130 complex. To test this hypothesis, we transiently expressed HA-LMO4 into HepG2 cells and left the cells either non-treated or treated with IL-6 for 30 min. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated in parallel with gp130 antibody or the control rabbit IgG, and the precipitates were resolved by different percentages of SDS-PAGE and blotted with different antibodies. We found that without induction, all the binding partners, including Jak1, SHP2, and SOCS3 as well as LMO4, could associate with gp130 (Fig. 4). Stimulation by IL-6 for 30 min strongly increased the binding of gp130 to SHP2, LMO4, and less strongly to SOCS3. On the other hand, as expected, the interaction of gp130 and Jak1 in the same experiment did not show obvious change upon IL-6 treatment. These data indicate that LMO4 associates with the gp130 complex, and IL-6 may enhance its association. Both LIM Domains of LMO4 Are Able to Bind to Its Interacting Proteins—LMO4 comprises two sequential LIM domains, each being defined by two zinc-coordinating cysteine-rich structures with similar length and high homology (Fig. 5A). We were interested in seeing which LIM domain mediated the binding of four interacting partners that we have characterized. We generated three GST fusion proteins containing the first LIM domain (Lim1S, aa 21–60), the second LIM domain (Lim2S, aa 86–125), and the second LIM plus the C terminus of LMO4 (Lim2L, aa 79–165). COS-1 cells were co-transfected with these GST constructs and the FLAG-SOCS3, FLAG-gp130 (containing only the intracellular domain, see Fig. 6A), Myc-SHP2, or Myc-Jak1. IP/Blot or GST pull-down experiments were performed to identify which LIM domain interacted. We found that both Lim1S and Lim2S could co-immunoprecipitate with SOCS3 and gp130, although the Lim2S binding was slightly weaker than Lim1S (Fig. 5B, left panels). We also examined the interactions between these GST fusion proteins and the endogenous SOCS3 and the full-length gp130, and the results indicated equal bindings of these two proteins to the Lim1S and Lim2S (Fig. 5C). Therefore, the difference in the binding affinity between Lim1S and Lim2S could be trivial. Consistent with this, both Lim1S and Lim2S showed equal binding"

We used single prophylactic administrations of a synthetic aspirin-triggered lipoxin A(4) signal mimetic, ATLa, to probe dynamics of early host-donor interactions in a mouse model for the inflammation-associated multifactorial disease of allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) -induced graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD). We first demonstrated that both host and donor are responsive to the ATLa signals. The simple and restricted regimen of a single prophylactic administration of ATLa [100 ng/mL to donor cells or 1 microg (approximately 50 microg/kg) i.v. to host] was sufficient to delay death. Clinical indicators of weight, skin lesions, diarrhea and eye inflammation were monitored. Histological analyses on day 45 post-BMT showed that the degree of cellular trafficking, particularly neutrophil infiltrate, and protection of end-organ target pathology are different, depending on whether the host or donor was treated with ATLa. Taken together, these results chart some ATLa protective effects on GvHD cellular dynamics over time and identify a previously unrecognized effect of host neutrophils in the early phase post-BMT as important determinants in the dynamics of GvHD onset and progression.-Devchand, P. R., Schmidt, B. A., Primo, V. C., Zhang, Q.-y., Arnaout, M. A., Serhan, C. N., Nikolic, B.

https://openalex.org/W2023563376,"Structural chromosomal aberrations are common in epithelial tumors. Here, we compared the location of centromeric breaks associated with whole arm translocations in seven adenocarcinoma cell lines and nine squamous cell carcinoma cell lines using SKY, microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Whole arm translocations were more frequent in squamous cell carcinomas (112 in nine cell lines and nine in one short-term culture) than in adenocarcinomas (13 in seven cases) and most often resulted in copy number alterations. Array CGH analysis demonstrated that in all squamous cell carcinomas and in most adenocarcinomas, the breakpoints of unbalanced whole arm translocations occurred between the two clones on the array flanking the centromeres. However, FISH with centromeric probes revealed that in squamous cell carcinomas, the marker chromosomes with whole arm translocations contained centromeres comprised of material from both participating chromosomes, while in adenocarcinomas centromeric material from only one of the chromosomes was present. These observations suggest that different mechanisms of centromeric instability underlie the formation of chromosomal aberrations in adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2013799380,"Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) constitutes a regulatory subunit of HIF-1, a major transcriptional activator of genes that coordinate physiological and pathological responses towards hypoxia. In order to identify novel interaction partners of HIF-1α we have applied T7 phage display system and identified a domain inherent in the retinoblastoma protein (pRB). The interaction between pRB and HIF-1α was confirmed by in vitro experiments and in transfected cells. Thereby, an HIF-1α domain spanning amino acids 530–694 was mapped to be required for pRB binding. Overexpression of pRB provoked transcriptional activation of HIF-1α under normoxia. Furthermore, the domain of pRB identified to bind HIF-1α in vitro is sufficient to cause HIF-1α transcriptional activation with the further notion that phosphorylation deficient pRB shows stronger HIF-1α transactivation. Using ChIP analysis, we show that HIF-1α responsive elements (HREs) are precipitated using α-pRB antibodies. Additionally, a functional interaction between pRB and HIF-1α is confirmed by showing that HIF-1α reverses the transcription repressor function of pRB."

The protease, designated bacillolysin MA (BL-MA), belongs to a family of neutral metalloproteinases based on the nucleotide sequence of its gene. At an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:540, BL-MA cleaved human plasminogen mainly at Ser441-Val442 to form BL-angiostatin and miniplasminogen with a Km of 3.0 ± 0.8 μm and a kcat of 0.70 ± 0.09 s−1. The resulting BL-angiostatins inhibited the proliferation, migration, and tube formation of vascular endothelial cells at concentrations of 1–10 μg/ml. Although BL-MA failed to activate plasminogen, it increased urokinase-catalyzed activation of plasminogen caused by production of miniplasminogen, which is highly susceptible to activation. In addition, BL-MA was active in converting prourokinase, prothrombin, coagulation factor X, and protein C to their active forms. BL-MA enhanced both the clotting of human plasma and clot dissolution in the presence of prourokinase. Thus, BL-MA affects blood coagulation and fibrinolysis systems and can be used to produce angiostatin-like plasminogen fragments and active serine proteases of human plasma.

During these studies, we identified a bacterial protease that enhances u-PA-catalyzed activation of plasminogen. The protease cleaves plasminogen to form angiostatin-like fragments and miniplasminogen. This paper describes purification and characterization of the protease, designated bacillolysin MA (BL-MA). Materials—The following chemicals and proteins were from commercial sources. Val-Leu-Lys-pNA (H-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide) was from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). FA-Gly-Leu-amide (3-(2-furylacryloyl)-Gly-Leu amide) and S2336 (pyroglutamyl-Pro-Arg-pNA) were from Sigma. Spectrozyme fXa (methoxycarbonyl-d-cyclohexylglycyl-Gly-Arg-pNA), Spectrozyme UK (carbobenzoxy-l-γ-glutamyl-(α-t-butoxy)-Gly-Arg-pNA), and Spectrozyme TH (H-d-hexahydrotyrosol-Ala-Arg-pNA) were from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). Other synthetic peptide substrates used were from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). Human high molecular mass two-chain u-PA was from JRC Pharmaceuticals (Kobe, Japan). Human factor X, human factor IX, human prothrombin, and human protein C were from Hematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT). Purified human pro-u-PA (with 0.23% intrinsic amidolytic activity toward Spectrozyme UK) was kindly provided by Mitsubishi Pharma, Osaka, Japan. Human plasminogen was affinity purified from human plasma (27.Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Science. 1970; 170: 1095-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). Angiostatin K1–3 was purified by lysine-Sepharose affinity chromatography from porcine elastase-digested plasminogen as described by O'Reilly et al. (18.O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Chen C. Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). Assay for BL-MA Activity—For determination of amidolytic activity toward FA-Gly-Leu-amide, 300 nm BL-MA was incubated in TBS/T (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.01% (w/v) Tween 80, pH 7.4) containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 30 μm FA-Gly-Leu-amide at 25 °C. The decrease in absorbance at 345 nm (cleavage at Gly-Leu) was monitored continuously for 3 min using a Hitachi model 320 spectrophotometer. Where indicated (see Fig. 2), varying temperatures and buffers (pH) were used. For determination of amidolytic activity toward other synthetic substrates, 300 nm BL-MA was incubated in TBS/T containing 1 mm CaCl2 and appropriate substrate as indicated (20–100 μm). After incubation at 37 °C, the release of pNA or aminomethylcoumarin from the substrate was determined periodically by measuring absorbance at 405 nm using a Bio-Rad model 550 microplate reader or fluorescence at 450 nm using a Corona MTP-32 microplate reader with an excitation wavelength of 365 nm. For determination of proteolytic activity, BL-MA (0.1 nm to 37 μm or concentrations shown in each experiment) was incubated with appropriate substrate protein solution (200 μg/ml or concentrations given in each experiment) in TBS/T containing 1 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C for 60 min (or time shown in each experiment). After incubation, reaction mixture was resolved on reduced SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. In kinetic experiments, bands were quantified by densitometric scanning. Production and Purification of BL-MA—Bacillus megaterium A9542 was isolated from a soil sample collected at Kokubunji, Tokyo, and deposited in International Patent Organism Depository at National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan (accession code FRM P-18268). The bacterium was grown aerobically for 6 days at 28 °C in medium consisting of 1% glucose, 3% corn starch, 1% soybean meal, 0.5% peptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.2% CaCO3, and 0.1% antifoam CB442, pH 7.0. After filtration, the 1,300-ml culture was diluted with 4,940 ml of water and 325 ml of isopropyl alcohol. The mixture was applied to a 200-ml CM-cellulose column equilibrated with MES and isopropyl alcohol (20 mm MES-NaOH and 5% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol, pH 6.5) at a flow rate of 15 ml/min. After washing the column with 800 ml of MES and isopropyl alcohol, BL-MA was eluted with 400 ml of MES and isopropyl alcohol containing 200 mm NaCl. Identification of BL-MA Gene-–Based on partial amino acid sequence of BL-MA and its similarity to NprM protein (28.Kühn S. Fortnagel P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), a 323-bp DNA fragment was amplified by PCR using chromosomal DNA from B. megaterium A9542 as a template and two oligonucleotide primers F2 (5′-CTATTGGCTCAGGTAAA-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 927–943 of the B. megaterium ATCC14581 nprM gene; EMBL X61380) and R2 (5′-ATTATTGTAACCGCTGC-3′, nucleotides 1249–1233 of nprM). The DNA fragment was sequenced with the primers F2 and R2. Subsequently, inverse PCR was carried out on HindIII-digested and religated chromosomal DNA from strain A9542 with primers F3′ (5′-TATTATGCAGGTGTGAC-3′, nucleotides 1159–1175 of the gene for BL-MA, blma; DDBJ accession code AB193158) and R0 (5′-TTTACCTGAGCCAATAG-3′, nucleotides 966–950 of blma). The amplified 2.1-kb DNA fragment was sequenced with the relevant primers derived from the sequence of the BL-MA gene fragment. To obtain the upstream region of the BL-MA gene, we amplified and sequenced a 1.2-kb DNA fragment by inverse PCR using XbaI-digested and religated chromosomal DNA with primers For1 (5′-GTTGATGCTATTAGCGG-3′, nucleotides 759–845 of blma) and R1 (5′-GTCAACTTGCTTCTGGC-3′, nucleotides 660–644 of blma). Automated DNA sequencing was performed on doublestrand DNA templates by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using an Applied Biosystems model 373A sequencer. The nucleotide sequence of the gene for BL-MA (blma) was deposited at DDBJ under the accession code AB193158. Assay for Activation of Serine Protease Zymogens—u-PA-catalyzed activation of plasminogen was assayed by determining Val-Leu-Lys-pNA hydrolysis. Human plasminogen (100 nm) was incubated at 37 °C with human two-chain u-PA (50–200 units/ml) and 100 μm Val-Leu-Lys-pNA at 37 °C in 50 μl of TBS/T. BL-MA-catalyzed activation of pro-u-PA was assayed by incubating 20 nm human pro-u-PA with 0.73–73 nm BL-MA and 100 μm Spectrozyme UK at 37 °C in 50 μl of TBS/T containing 1 mm CaCl2. Similarly, BL-MA-catalyzed activations of human factor X, human prothrombin, and human protein C were assayed at 37 °C in 50 μl of TBS/T containing 1 mm CaCl2 using 20 nm zymogen, 1–500 nm BL-MA, and 100 μm chromogenic substrate (Spectrozyme fXa, Spectrozyme TH, or S2336, respectively). The hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrates was monitored periodically at 405 nm. Purification of Angiostatin-like Plasminogen Fragment (BL-Angiostatin) and Miniplasminogen-like Fragment Produced by BL-MA Cleavage—BL-angiostatin and miniplasminogen-like fragment were purified by lysine-Sepharose chromatography as follows. Human plasminogen (2 μm) was incubated with 16 nm BL-MA at 37 °C for 60 min in 8 ml of TBS/T containing 1 mm CaCl2. After adding 220 μl of 0.2 m EDTA to inactivate BL-MA, the mixture was applied to a 4.6 × 50-mm lysine-Sepharose column equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. After washing with the buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, BL-angiostatin was eluted with 2 ml of 200 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid. Both the flow-through fraction (containing miniplasminogen-like fragment) and 6-aminohexanoic acid eluate were passed separately through a DEAE-Sepharose column. After being dialyzed against buffer (2 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 15 mm NaCl), the resulting materials were lyophilized and dissolved in 1/10 volume of 0.01% Tween 80 (for miniplasminogen-like fragment) or water (for BL-angiostatin). Determination of Protein Sequence—Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and a section of membrane was subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis on a model 476A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Radioiodination of Proteins—To a glass tube coated with 5 μg of IODO-GEN, 10 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 μl of Na125I (0.1 mCi), and either 29.3 μm plasminogen in 50 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, or 37 nm pro-u-PA in 50 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, were added successively. After standing on ice for 10 min, the mixture received 50 μl of 500 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.01% Triton X-100. After 15 min at room temperature, a 100-μl aliquot of the mixture was applied to a 0.9-ml Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with TBS/T to remove free Na125I. Cell Culture—Bovine capillary endothelial cells (BCECs; obtained from ATCC) were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs; obtained from Clonetics, San Diego) were grown in EGM (endothelial cell growth medium; Clonetics) containing 2% FCS. HT1080 cells and rat primary fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM and 10% FCS, and Lewis lung carcinoma cells and Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640/10% FCS. Cell Proliferation Assay—The proliferation of endothelial cell was assayed as described previously (9.Cao Y. Ji R.-W. Davidson D. Schaller J. Marti D. Söhndel S. McCance S.G. O'Reilly M.S. Llinas M.

Cells were seeded into gelatin-coated 24-well plates at 12,500 cells/500 μl of DMEM and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Medium was replaced by 250 μl of DMEM and 5% FCS containing BL-angiostatin or angiostatin K1–3. After incubation for 20 min, 250 μl of DMEM containing 2 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor was added and incubated for 3 days. Cells were dispersed in 100 μl of 0.05% trypsin and counted using a hemocytometer. In experiments using HUVECs, cells were dispersed in trypsin/EDTA solution (Clonetics) and resuspended with EGM defective in human epidermal growth factor. Cells (2,500 cells in 100 μl) were seeded into 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Medium was replaced by 100 μl of fresh medium containing BL-angiostatin or angiostatin K1–3. After incubation for 30 min, 100 μl of EGM containing 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor was added and incubated for 3 days. The ability of cells to reduce formazan-forming reagent (WST-1; Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) was determined as an index of cell number (26.Ohyama S. Harada T. Chikanishi T. Miura Y. Hasumi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The growth of nonendothelial cells was assayed by a method similar to that employed for the assay for HUVEC proliferation, using respective growth medium. Endothelial Cell Migration Assay—A modified Boyden chamber method was used (29.Claesson-Welsh L. Welsh M. Ito N. Anand-Apte B. Soker S. Zetter B. O'Reilly M. Folkman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5579-5583Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Polycarbonate membrane with 8-μm pores was coated with 15 μg of fibronectin and placed over a 24-well culture plate containing 500 μl of EGM supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor. After 30 min, HUVECs that had been starved overnight in serum- and growth factor-free EGM and 0.1% bovine serum albumin were seeded into the upper chamber (1.1 × 105 cells in 500 μl of EGM containing 20 μg/ml BL-angiostatin or angiostatin K1–3) and incubated for 5 h. Nonmigrated cells were scraped off the upper chamber using cotton swabs. Migrated cells were fixed with 70% ethanol for 30 min, stained with Giemsa for 30 min, and counted under a light microscope at a ×100 magnification. Endothelial Cell Tube Formation Assay—Approximately 4.0 × 104 cells in 200 μl of MCDB 131 medium were seeded into a 24-well culture plate containing 200 μl of collagen gel in MCDB 131 medium. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the medium was removed, and 200 μl of collagen gel was overlaid. After gel formation for 30 min, each well received 200 μl of MCDB 131 medium. Both the medium and collagen gel contained 5% FCS, 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 10 μg/ml either BL-angiostatin or angiostatin K1–3. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, cultures were examined under a light microscope at a ×40 magnification. The length of tubes in three fields was measured. Plasma Clot Formation and Clot Dissolution—Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was determined using citrated human platelet-poor plasma. Plasma (60 μl) was mixed with 30 μl of BL-MA (0–600 nm in PBS (20 mm sodium phosphate and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4)) and 60 μl of APTT reagent (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan). After incubation for 2 min at 37 °C, the mixture received 50 μl of CaCl2 (50 mm in saline) to initiate clotting reaction, which was monitored at 37 °C using a NKK Hematracer 1 (Niko Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan). The course of plasma clot formation and clot dissolution was measured by thrombelastography on a TE-700 Clot Tracer (Erma, Tokyo, Japan). Citrated human plasma (300 μl) was mixed with 20 μl of BL-MA (1–8 μm)inPBS and 20 μl of either PBS or PBS containing 200 nm pro-u-PA. Plasma clot formation was initiated by adding 60 μl of 133 mm CaCl2, and thrombelastogram was recorded at 37 °C. Purification and Primary Structure of BL-MA—B. megaterium A9542 was selected from a screen for searching modulators of plasminogen activation, employing 1,040 strains of microorganisms. The bacteria produced an activity to convert plasminogen to angiostatin-like fragments and miniplasminogen-like fragments. By tracing this activity, we tried several chromatographic purifications and found that CM-cellulose chromatography was most effective. From 1,300 ml of culture supernatant, we obtained 34.1 mg of electrophoretically homogeneous preparation of BL-MA (apparent molecular mass of 35.3 kDa in reduced SDS-PAGE) through a single-step chromatography on a CM-cellulose column (Fig. 1A). In this process, a 68.5-fold purification was achieved with a yield of 48% (Fig. 1B). The automated Edman degradation of the protein yielded VTGTNAIGSG as an N-terminal sequence (Fig. 1C). The data base search suggested that the sequence was highly similar to an internal amino acid sequence deduced from nucleotide sequence of a protease gene, nprM, from B. megaterium ATCC 14581 (28.Kühn S. Fortnagel P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). So, we amplified the gene for BL-MA using primers corresponding to the obtained N-terminal sequence and 5′ and 3′ regions of nprM. The nucleotide sequencing of the resulting PCR-amplified DNA fragments indicated that sequence of the coding region of the gene for BL-MA had 97.1% identity compared with the coding sequence of the nprM. The deduced amino acid sequence of BL-MA revealed 10 differences in amino acid residues from that of nprM protein (Fig. 1D). The amino acids at putative signal peptide cleavage site, propeptide cleavage site, zinc binding site, and active site in BL-MA were the same as those of NprM protein. Characterization of Enzymatic Activity of BL-MA—To characterize the catalytic activity of BL-MA, we first examined various chromogenic and fluorogenic synthetic peptides for their susceptibility to hydrolysis by BL-MA. The enzyme failed to release pNA or aminomethylcoumarin from Val-Leu-Lys-pNA, pyroglutamyl-Pro-Arg-pNA, methoxycarbonyl-d-cyclohexylglycyl-Gly-Arg-pNA, carbobenzoxy-l-γ-glutamyl-(α-t-butoxy)-Gly-Arg-pNA, H-d-hexahydrotyrosol-Ala-Arg-pNA, succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-pNA, Leu-pNA, benzoyl-Tyr-pNA, benzoyl-Arg-pNA, pyroglutamyl-Phe-Leu-pNA, t-butyloxycarbonyl-Val-Leu-Lys-MCA, t-butyloxycarbonyl-Glu-Lys-Lys-MCA, t-butyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-MCA, Gly-Gly-Arg-MCA, benzyloxycarbonyl-Arg-Arg-MCA, benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-MCA, and succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-MCA. However, FA-Gly-Leu-amide was hydrolyzed efficiently by BL-MA. Among the protein substrates tested, plasminogen, casein, and gelatin were partially degraded by BL-MA at 3.7 nm (enzyme: substrate ratio at 1:1,600 by weight), whereas cleavages of bovine serum albumin, α2-plasmin inhibitor, ovalbumin, and hemoglobin were only observed at higher BL-MA concentrations (1.8–37 μm; enzyme:substrate ratio at 1:3.2 to 1:0.16 by weight). BL-MA-catalyzed plasminogen fragmentation was completely inhibited by 1 mm EDTA but not by 1 mm iodoacetic acid, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm leupeptin, 0.5 mm pepstatin A, 0.5 mm antipain, 1 mm N-α-tosyl-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 5 μm α2-plasmin inhibitor, and 100 kallikrein inhibitor units/ml aprotinin. Optimal catalytic conditions and enzyme stability were examined using FA-Gly-Leu-amide as a substrate. BL-MA had pH and temperature optima at pH 7.4 and 60 °C, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). The enzyme activity was increased by CoCl2 (by 1.8-fold at 0.3 mm) and reduced by ZnCl2 (by 80% at 1 mm), whereas CaCl2 did not affect activity at 0.08–2.4 mm (Fig. 2C). BL-MA kept its activity after treatment at 37 °C for 60 min at pH 5 to 9, whereas the enzyme completely lost its activity by treatment at pH 4 and 11.7 (Fig. 2A). When BL-MA was treated at 70 °C for 20 min, the enzyme activity was reduced by 65%, but the enzyme was stable at 25–60 °C (Fig. 2B). The above data suggest that BL-MA is a neutral metalloproteinase. These results are consistent with the observation that the nucleotide sequence of the gene for BL-MA shows significant similarity to npr, a bacterial gene family of neutral metalloproteinase. BL-MA-catalyzed Plasminogen Cleavage—BL-MA was active in cleaving 2 μm human plasminogen at a concentration as low as 3.7 nm (enzyme:substrate ratio at ∼ 1:540 by mol) after incubation at 37 °C for 60 min. Under these conditions, plasminogen gave three major fragments at 58.4 (fragment 1), 53.5 (fragment 2), and 45.9 kDa (fragment 4) in nonreduced SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A), which corresponded to bands at 65.4, 62.0, and 40.5 kDa, respectively, in reduced SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B). The BL-MA-catalyzed cleavage of plasminogen could be observed in 50% human serum milieu, although the efficiency was reduced by >100-fold (Fig. 3C). Both fragments 1 and 2 had the same N-terminal sequence, initiating with Glu1 of plasminogen (Fig. 3D). Upon treatment with peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-β-glucosaminyl)-asparagine amidase F, fragment 1 disappeared, and the intensity of the band for fragment 2 increased (Fig. 3E). These results suggested that the diff"

We have previously shown that gastroduodenal–esophageal reflux (GDER) together with N-methyl-N-benzylnitrosamine (MBN) induces Barrett's esophagus (BE) and malignant transformation of the esophageal mucosa in mice. This process is enhanced in a p27 null background. Here, we show that chronic flavopiridol administration sharply reduced the prevalence of BE in GDER/MBN-treated p27 knockout mice when compared to animals treated with diluent only (7 vs 26%, P=0.0079). Similarly, flavopiridol reduced the prevalence of BAA (11 vs 32%, P=0.0098) and overall cancer prevalence (15 vs 60%, P<0.0001). In addition, appropriate molecular targeting by flavopiridol in tumor cells was confirmed by downregulation of cyclin D1, a known target of this pan-cdk inhibitor. The results of this study represent the experimental basis for chemoprevention with cdk inhibitors in human BE and BAA."

https://openalex.org/W1966862945,"Tal1/SCL is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor critical for normal hematopoiesis. To understand the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation by Tal1/SCL, we combined an in vitro DNA binding strategy and an in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis to search for Tal1/SCL target regions in K562 erythroleukemia cells. A 0.4-kb genomic DNA clone containing two Tal1/SCL binding E-boxes and GATA- and SATB1-binding motifs (EEGS) was identified that localized to the pericentromeric region with high homology to satellite 2 DNA. Pericentric DNA is related to heterochromatin and gene inactivation. We found that Tal1/SCL could complex with the histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9)-specific methyltransferase Suv39H1. Binding of Tal1/SCL to EEGS chromatin correlated with hypermethylation of H3K9 and the association of heterochromatin protein HP1 to this region. In Rep4 reporter gene assays, EEGS affected repression in a manner dependent on the expression level of Tal1/SCL that was accompanied by increased H3K9 methylation in chromatin associated with EEGS and a linked promoter. A specific histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, relieved Tal1/SCL-mediated repression by EEGS. In addition, SATB1 bound EEGS chromatin and promoted Tal1/SCL EEGS-dependent repression. We expand the list of potential interacting partners for Tal1/SCL by demonstrating direct associations of Tal1/SCL with SATB1 and with Suv39H1.

Modification of the N termini in core histones by acetylation, phosphorylation, or methylation affects chromatin-based modulation of gene expression and contributes to the epigenetic control of gene regulation (1.Jenuwein T.

Gene inactivation is associated with the lowest level of histone acetylation, condensed chromatin regions, and methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3-MeK9), whereas gene activation is associated with a marked increase in histone acetylation. The highest levels of acetylation are observed at regulatory regions upstream of genes, as exemplified by the 5′-hypersensitive region of the chicken β-globin locus where high histone acetylation protects the downstream promoter DNA from methylation (3.Litt M.D. Simpson M.

Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3-MeK9) by site-specific histone methyltransferases, such as Suv39H1, generates a binding site for heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1).

A Tal1-SCL multifactorial complex enhances the c-kit promoter in B-cells but does not require Tal1/SCL or GATA-binding motifs (22.Lecuyer E. Herblot S. Saint-Denis M. Martin R. Begley C.G. Porcher C. Orkin S.H. Hoang T. Blood. 2002; 100: 2430-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The DNA binding domain is dispensable for Tal1/SCL rescue of hematopoietic stem cell formation (23.Porcher C. Liao E.C. Fujiwara Y. Zon L.I. Orkin S.H. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 4603-4615PubMed Google Scholar) and for erythroid differentiation of human CD34+ cells, although some differences are observed in CD34 function and glycophorin A expression (24.Ravet E.

In early erythroid cells, histone acetylation of the α-globin gene is initiated at the far upstream region and is associated with binding by a complex containing GATA-2 (prior to the induction of GATA-1), NF-E2, and Tal1/SCL (25.Anguita E. Hughes J. Heyworth C. Blobel G.A. Wood W.G. Higgs D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2841-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). One proposed role for Tal1/SCL in the β-globin locus is the enhancer activity of hypersensitivity site 2 in the locus control region (26.Elnitski L. Miller W. Hardison R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 369-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) that is required for high level transcription of the β-like globin genes (27.Bender M.A. Bulger M. Close J. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 387-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Tal1/SCL interacts with the nuclear corepressor mSin3A, a subunit of the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase complex, and the histone deacetylase HDAC1 to repress transcription (13.Huang S. Brandt S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2248-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This suggests that alteration in chromatin structure may underlie Tal1/SCL-mediated transcriptional repression. Hence, Tal1/SCL associates with ubiquitous and tissue-specific transcription factors to regulate gene expression and can function as a transcription activator or repressor depending on its interacting partners. Although the Tal1/SCL-preferred DNA-binding sequence is known, only a small number of Tal1/SCL target genes have been identified (20.Xu Z. Huang S. Chang L.S. Agulnick A.D. Brandt S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7585-7599Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 21.Lahlil R. Lecuyer E. Herblot S. Hoang T. Mol. Cell.

Therefore, delineation of the genomic regions to which Tal1/SCL is recruited should provide insight into the mechanisms of Tal1/SCL-directed gene expression during hematopoiesis. In searching for additional Tal1/SCL genomic binding sites, we isolated an in vivo Tal1/SCL target sequence from K562 erythroid cells. This sequence, EEGS, localizes to chromosome 1 and other chromosomes at the pericentromere, a region associated with formation of heterochromatin and gene silencing. We established that the EEGS element is a target of Tal1-mediated repression through a chromatin remodeling mechanism involving H3K9 methylation and HP1 binding. Our study expands the interacting partners for Tal1/SCL and suggests a novel mechanism by which Tal1/SCL can repress transcription. Cell Culture and Nuclear Extracts—Erythroleukemia K562 cells and HeLa cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin (100 μl/ml) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For RT-PCR expression analysis, the total RNA was prepared from washed cells, and first strand cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT)16 (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). PCR analysis was carried out using gene-specific primers. Nuclear extracts were prepared from K562 cells as described previously (29.Deininger P.L. Jolly D.J. Rubin C.M. Friedmann T. Schmid C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 17-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). K562 cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and incubated on ice for 5 min. Cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 2 min and washed with 1 ml of the same buffer. The cell pellet was resuspended in 2× volume of 20 mm Hepes, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated on ice for 30 min. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatant collected. Isolation of Tal1/SCL-bound DNA Fragments in Vitro—Genomic DNA target sites for Tal1/SCL were isolated by incubating genomic DNA with K562 nuclear extract followed by isolation of DNA-Tal1-SCL complexes using a Tal1/SCL-specific antibody (Geneka Biotechnology, Inc., Quebec, Canada) (30.Cuvier O. Hart C.M. Laemmli U.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7478-7486Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In brief, K562 genomic DNA was sonicated to an average size of 0.6 kb, ligated to a common linker DNA fragment (sense, 5′-GCGGTGACCCGGGAGATCTGAATTC-3′; antisense, 5′-GAATTCAGATC-3′), and incubated with K562 nuclear extract. DNA-protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-Tal1/SCL antibody and isolated using protein G-agarose in 1 ml of binding buffer and overnight rotation at 4 °C. The reaction mixture was centrifuged for 10 s, washed rapidly several times with binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2), and digested with proteinase K. DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol-precipitated. The DNA was then amplified by ligation-mediated PCR using the oligonucleotides previously described as primers. The selection procedure of binding, immunoprecipitation, and ligation-mediated PCR was repeated using 100 ng of amplified DNA, and after three cycles of selection, a library was constructed by ligation of the PCR product into the pCR 4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). DNA Binding Assays—For electromobility shift assays (EMSA), DNA probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Binding of nuclear extract to DNA probes was carried out in a 24-μl reaction volume containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1 mg/μl Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mg/μl bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction mix was incubated for 30 min at 4–10 °C. DNA-protein complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, followed by autoradiography. Slide Preparation—Metaphase chromosome spreads were prepared from the peripheral blood leukocytes of a male donor. Whole blood cells were grown for 72–96 h in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml), and phytohemagglutinin (5 μg/ml) (Murex Diagnostic Ltd., Dartford, UK). Cells were treated with ethidium bromide (5 mg/ml) for 1.5 h, and the reaction was stopped with colcemid (0.05 mg/ml) treatment for 15 min during the log phase growth followed by treatment in hypotonic KCl (0.54%) for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were then harvested and fixed in cold (-20 °C) methanol/acetic acid (3:1). Fresh slides were equilibrated in 2× SSC solution at 37 °C and dehydrated in increasing ethanol solutions of 70, 80, and 95%. Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization—Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed as described previously (31.Pack S.D. Zbar B. Pak E. Ault D.O. Humphrey J.S. Pham T. Hurley K. Weil R.J.

In brief, the DNA probe from the BAC clone (a 129-kb human genomic fragment containing the entire EEGS sequence) (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) was labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Vysis, Downers Grove, IL) by nick translation (Roche Applied Science) and ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 50× herring sperm DNA and 50× Cot-1 human DNA. The DNA pellet was resuspended in Hybrisol solution (50% deionized formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 2× SSC) to a final concentration of 25 ng/ml. Slides were denatured in 70% formamide, 2× SSC at 72 °C for 2 min, dehydrated sequentially in cold (-20 °C) ethanol solutions of 70, 85, and 100% for 2 min, and air-dried. Probes were denatured at 78 °C for 10 min and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C for preannealing. A total of 250 μg of DNA probe was applied to the slide. Overnight hybridization was done in a humidified chamber at 37 °C. Post-hybridization washes were at 45 °C in 50% formamide, 2× SSC (three times for 5 min), 1× SSC (two times for 5 min), and 0.1× SSC (two times for 5 min). Detection was performed using rhodamine-conjugated anti-digoxigenin rhodamine (40 min at 37 °C), followed by washing in 4× SSC, 0.1% Tween 20 solution at room temperature for 2 min and then followed by counterstaining with DAPI antifade (0.25 mg/ml). Digital Image Analysis—Digital acquisition of gray scale images was done using a charge-coupled device Photometrics CCD camera SenSys (Photometrics, Ltd., Tucson, AZ) interfaced to a Power PC 1800 computer and mounted on a Zeiss Axiophot-2 epifluorescence microscope. Images were acquired by using filters specific for DAPI, fluorescein, and rhodamine (TR1, TR2, and TR3 from Chroma Technologies, Brattleboro, VT, and IP Lab Image software from Scanalytics Inc., Fairfax, VA) (31.Pack S.D.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5560-5564PubMed Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was carried out as described previously (33.Liu R. Liu H. Chen X. Kirby M. Brown P.O. Zhao K. Cell. 2001; 106: 309-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Formaldehyde was added to the cell cultures at a concentration of 1% (v/v) of the culture medium. Fixation proceeded at 22 °C for 10 min and was stopped by the addition of 125 mm glycine. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in binding buffer containing 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, and 140 mm NaCl (RIPA buffer), and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The lysed cells were sonicated for 4 min at a power setting level of 4 with the Ultrasonic Processor (HEAT system, Farmingdale, NY). Cell debris was removed by brief centrifugation (4000 rpm for 1 min). 300 μl of the chromatin suspension and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-Tal1/SCL antibody, anti-SATB1 serum, or preimmune serum. The immunoprecipitates (IP fraction) were washed three times with RIPA buffer. After reversal of cross-linking at 65 °C for 8 h, DNA was purified by proteinase K digestion, phenol/chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. The PCR primers for the EEGS element are as follows: forward, 5′-TCAATAATGATCCCTTTCGAGTCC-3′; reverse, 5′-TGGAAACACCATCGAATTGAAAC-3′. After PCR analysis, the reaction products were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Construction of Reporter Gene Plasmid—Pairs of complementary oligonucleotides (104 bp) were synthesized based on the native or mutated EEGS sequence (Table IV) containing the core-binding domain. To create the luciferase reporter plasmid pEEGS, the EEGS oligonucleotides were annealed and inserted into the BglII and KpnI sites of the pGL2-promoter vector containing the SV40 promoter and the luciferase reporter gene (Promega, Madison, WI). To create the pREP4/Luc-EEGS reporter vector, the EEGS-SV40 promoter fragment was excised from pEEGS and inserted between the KpnI and Hind III sites of pREP4/Luc. For each transfection, 1.0 × 107 K562 or HeLa cells were transfected with a total of 5 μg of plasmid DNA using the Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After 48 h, cells were harvested and lysed in 300 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison WI), and luciferase activity was assayed using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). The RSV-β-galactosidase vector (Promega, Madison, WI) (0.1 μg) was cotransfected as an internal control for normalizing transfection efficiency. For cotransfection, 2.5 μg of the reporter gene construct was cotransfected with the Tal1/SCL expression vector (hTal1/SCL-pcDNA1.1), SATB1 expression vector (pECE-AT 1146) (34.Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Maass K. Bode J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12005-12010Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), or vector without insert to make up the 5 μg total of plasmid DNA. Means ± S.D. were determined from independent transfection assays (n = 3). Coimmunoprecipitation—For coimmunoprecipitation, 100 μg of cell nuclear extract was incubated with antibody to Tal1/SCL (from E. Bresnick), SUV39H1 or SATB1, or preimmune serum (as negative control) and protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) in 1 ml of binding buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) for 3 h at 5 °C. The reaction mixture was pelleted by brief centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of binding buffer, rotated at 5 °C for 5 min, and briefly centrifuged. The washing process was repeated three times. The immunoprecipitated complexes were separated on a polyacrylamide gel. Antibody to Tal1/SCL (Geneka Biotechnology, Inc., Quebec, Canada), SUV39H1, or SATB1 was used for Western blot analysis of bound proteins. Real Time Quantitative PCR Analysis—Real time quantitative analysis was carried out as described previously (35.Yu X. Shacka J.J. Eells J.B. Suarez-Quian C. Przygodzki R.M. Beleslin-Cokic B. Lin C.S.

In brief, PCR analyses were used to determine the amount of selected ChIP DNA using DNA-specific primers and fluorescent-labeled TaqMan probes (6-carboxyfluorescein as the 5′-fluorescent reporter, tetramethylrhodamine as 3′ end quencher) in an ABI 7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). DNA concentration was measured by PicoGreen double-stranded DNA quantitation reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). 2 ng of reference genomic DNA (Ref) and 2 ng of DNA from the ChIP selected immunoprecipitated fraction (IP) were used as template for PCR. Enrichment of the specific sequences in the IP fraction was determined by comparison with the reference control. At low amplification the threshold cycle number (Ct) is directly proportional to the amount of corresponding specific DNA and is in the linear range for the respective DNA pools. Each cycle represents a 2× amplification of the product. The fold difference of the enrichment in the ChIP-selected DNA IP fraction relative to genomic DNA Ref fraction is determined by IP/Ref = 2 (Ct(Ref) - Ct(IP)) (36.Litt M.D. Simpson M. Recillas-Targa F. Prioleau M.N. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2224-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Primers and probe for EEGS were synthesized (forward, 5′-CAATAATGATCCCTTTCGAG-3′; reverse, 5′-GCTAAAGGAATCAACATCG-3′; probe, 5′-CGTTTCAATTCGATGGTGTTTC-3′). Isolation of New Genomic Tal1/SCL-binding Sites—Earlier searches for Tal1/SCL-binding sequences identified Tal1/SCL-specific DNA motifs but were less successful in identifying target genes (28.Cohen-Kaminsky S. Maouche-Chretien L. Vitelli L. Vinit M.A. Blanchard I. Yamamoto M. Peschle C. Romeo P.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5151-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 37.Hsu H.L. Wadman I. Tsan J.T. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5947-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In ChIP assays, 10% of the Tal1/SCL-binding motifs from murine erythroleukemia cells appeared in tandem with a GATA site, including one that exhibited positive transcriptional activity and localized to the intron of a gene of unknown function that was homologous to the corresponding sequence for the N terminus of otegelin (28.Cohen-Kaminsky S. Maouche-Chretien L. Vitelli L. Vinit M.A. Blanchard I. Yamamoto M. Peschle C. Romeo P.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5151-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To expand on target genes of Tal1/SCL, we combined an in vitro DNA binding strategy with ChIP. This method was used previously to identify a class of chromatin boundary elements (30.Cuvier O. Hart C.M. Laemmli U.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7478-7486Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The preliminary in vitro screen offered the ability to perform several cycles of selection with the possibility of enriching the Tal1/SCL-specific target DNA sequences that were then confirmed by ChIP analysis. Total K562 genomic DNA was fragmented, ligated to a common linker DNA, and incubated with K562 nuclear extract. Complexes containing Tal1/SCL binding to DNA were selected by immunoprecipitation using Tal1/SCL-specific antibody. Purified DNA was PCR-amplified, and the selection process was repeated to increase specificity for enrichment of DNA fragments binding to Tal1/SCL. The sequences were confirmed by EMSA incorporating the preferred Tal1/SCL-binding sequence into the probe T1 (5′-ACCTGAACAGATGGTCGGCT-3′) (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–10). DNA was subjected to three cycles of selection, and DNA fragments exhibiting Tal1/SCL binding were used for library construction. Individual clones demonstrating competition for Tal1/SCL binding were sequenced and compared with previously sequenced genomic DNA using the National Center for Biotechnology Information advanced BLAST search (38.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar). Among the 75 sequenced DNA clones that varied in length from 300 to 500 bp, no known genes were identified. About 60% of the fragments share homology to the genomic DNA working draft sequences from different chromosomes. One clone, EEGS, of 388 bp had the highest homology score from the BLAST search and exhibited full-length homology with genomic DNA. EEGS was able to compete for Tal1/SCL binding at a level comparable with the preferred Tal1/SCL-binding sequence (Fig. 1A, lanes 11–14). The specific binding of EEGS to Tal1 was further confirmed by the titration of EEGS as competitor in EMSA (Fig. 1B). The EEGS Sequence Localized in Satellite DNA—EEGS contains two E-box motifs, including the preferred Tal1/SCL-binding motif CAGATG (17.Hsu H.L. Huang L. Tsan J.T. Funk W. Wright W.E. Hu J.S. Kingston R.E. Baer R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1256-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), a GATA-binding site, and an overlapping SATB1-binding sequence consisting of multiple short ATC sequences of 15–19 bp (Fig. 1C). SATB1 bound a double-stranded base unpairing region and specifically recognized a specialized DNA context (an ATC sequence context rather than simply “ATC-rich”) characterized by a cluster of sequence stretches with well mixed As and Ts but either Cs or"

We found that plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) was upregulated fourfold in aggressive fibromatosis. We investigated the ability of beta-catenin to regulate a PAI-1 reporter, and found that PAI-1 is an indirect target. To determine the role of PAI-1 in vivo, a mouse containing a targeted deletion in Pai-1 was crossed with a mouse that develops aggressive fibromatosis and gastrointestinal tumors (Apc/Apc1638N mouse). Pai-1 deficiency reduced the number of aggressive fibromatosis tumors formed, but not the number of gastrointestinal tumors. Deficiency of Pai-1 reduced tumor cell proliferation and motility rate. Although PAI-1 can alter cell motility by competing for a common binding site on vitronectin, blocking this site did not alter the motility rate. The number of cells moving through matrigel (invasion rate) did not change with Pai-1 deficiency, but because of the low motility rate the invasion index (invasion rate/motility) was increased in Pai-1-deficient cells. This suggests a proteolytic effect for PAI-1 regulating cell invasiveness. Our study found that, although PAI-1 has cellular effects that could inhibit or enhance tumor growth, on balance, it acts as a tumor enhancer in aggressive fibromatosis."
