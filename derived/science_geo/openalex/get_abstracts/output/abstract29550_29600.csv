https://openalex.org/W2126766503,"We have cloned, sequenced, and expressed full length cDNA clones encoding two abundant, luminal endoplasmic reticulum proteins (ERp), ERp59/PDI and ERp72. ERp59/PDI has been identified as the microsomal enzyme protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). An analysis of the amino acid sequence of ERp72 showed that it shared sequence identity with ERp59/PDI at three discrete regions, having three copies of the sequences that are thought to be the CGHC-containing active sites of ERp59/PDI. Thus, ERp72 appears to be a newly described member of the family of CGHC-containing proteins. ERp59/PDI has the sequence KDEL at its COOH terminus while ERp72 has the related sequence KEEL. Removal of the KDEL of ERp59/PDI or the KEEL of ERp72 by in vitro mutagenesis techniques and subsequent analysis of the mutants in transient expression assays, showed that both sequences are endoplasmic reticulum retention signals for their respective proteins. The most dramatic difference in secretion between the wild type and the mutant forms of the protein was seen in the case of ERp72."
https://openalex.org/W1977379640,"Hypervariable minisatellite DNA sequences are short tandemly repeated sequences that are present throughout the human genome and are implicated to enhance recombination. We have constructed a consensus hypervariable minisatellite sequence and analyzed its effect on homologous recombination in human cells in culture. The consensus sequence d(AGAGGTGGGCAGGTGG)6.5 is shown to stimulate homologous recombination up to 13.5-fold. The stimulation occurs at a distance and in both directions but does show a quantitative directionality. Stimulation occurs in a codominant manner, and the sequence is inherited equally in the products. Enhancement is maintained, but at a reduced level, when double-strand breaks are introduced into the substrates. Multiple unselected recombination events are promoted, and preferential stimulation of reciprocal exchange events is demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1814062958,"In hepatocytes from fasted rats, several amino acids are known to stimulate glycogen synthesis via activation of glycogen synthase. The hypothesis that an increase in cell volume resulting from amino acid uptake may be involved in the stimulation of glycogen synthesis is supported by the following observations. 1) The extent of stimulation of glycogen synthesis by both metabolizable and nonmetabolizable amino acids was directly proportional to their ability to increase cell volume, except for proline, which stimulated glycogen synthesis more than could be accounted for by the increase in cell volume. 2) Both cell swelling and stimulation of glycogen synthesis by amino acids were prevented when hepatocytes were incubated in hyperosmotic media containing sucrose or raffinose. 3) Increasing the cell volume by incubating hepatocytes in Na(+)-depleted media in the absence of amino acids also stimulated glycogen synthesis. 4) Stimulation of glycogen synthesis by Na+ depletion was prevented by restoring the normal osmolarity with sucrose, but not with choline chloride which, by itself, stimulated glycogen synthesis and increased the cell volume. It is concluded that stimulation of glycogen synthesis by amino acids is due, at least in part, to an increase in hepatocyte volume resulting from amino acid uptake, and that hepatocyte swelling per se stimulates glycogen synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1598950170,"5'-(N-Ethyl)carboxamidoadenosine (NECA), an analog of adenosine, transiently stimulated a rat tumor mast cell (RBL-2H3 cells) to cause a release of inositol phosphates and an increase in levels of Ca2+ in the cytosol. It failed, however, to stimulate a sustained uptake of 45Ca2+ or secretion. The effects of other agents that act on P1- or P2-purinergic receptors suggested that NECA and other adenosine agonists acted via a novel subtype of adenosine membrane receptor. Although the order of potency of agonists was characteristic of A2-adenosine receptors, there was no indication of the involvement of adenylate cyclase, and antagonists such as isobutylmethylxanthine, 8-phenyltheophylline, and 8-p-sulfophenyltheophylline inhibited the responses to either NECA or antigen. The fact that stimulation of inositol phospholipid hydrolysis by NECA in washed, permeabilized RBL-2H3 cells was blocked by pertussis toxin as well as by cholera toxin suggested instead that the NECA-sensitive receptor activated phospholipase C via a G-protein. In contrast to NECA, antigen stimulation resulted in a pertussis toxin-resistant, sustained hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids, increases in free intracellular Ca2+, accelerated influx of 45Ca2+, and secretion from RBL-2H3 cells. In combination with NECA, all responses to antigen were markedly enhanced, and the enhancement was selectively blocked by pertussis toxin. The ability of antigen, but not NECA, to provoke secretion may be dependent primarily on the sustained activation of a cholera toxin-sensitive Ca2+ influx pathway that serves to amplify stimulatory signals for secretion. These studies also suggested that phospholipase C could be activated through different G-proteins via different receptors within the same cell."
https://openalex.org/W1573228711,"A novel transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) mRNA of about 3.0 kilobases, which encodes a putative protein of 382 amino acids, has been identified in amphibians by cDNA cloning. This mRNA, which we designate as TGF-beta 5, is developmentally regulated and highly expressed beginning at early neurula (stage 14) and in many adult tissues in Xenopus laevis. Following the first methionine, the putative precursor protein has a hydrophobic region, approximately 22 amino acids long, which probably represents a signal sequence, similar to that found in TGF-beta s 1-3. The precursor also has potential sites for glycosylation, integrin binding (RGD), and a tetrabasic amino acid (RKKR) site for potential cleavage of the precursor peptide to a biologically active protein. The putative mature protein consists of 112 amino acids with 9 cysteines and has 76, 66, 69, and 72% identity to TGF-beta s 1-4, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1637720115,"Deuterium-labeled fatty acids have been used to elucidate the sex pheromone biosynthetic pathway in Spodoptera littoralis. Label from palmitic acid was incorporated during the scotophase into all the pheromone acetates and their corresponding fatty acyl intermediates. (Z,E)-9,11-tetradecadienyl acetate, the major component of the pheromone blend, is synthesized from palmitic acid via tetradecanoic acid, which, by the action of a specific (E)-11 desaturase and subsequently a (Z)-9 desaturase, is converted into (Z,E)-9,11-tetradecadienoate. By further reduction and acetylation, this compound leads to the dienne acetate. Deuterated precursors applied to the pheromone gland during the photophase were also incorporated into the pheromone. The percentage of labeled (Z,E)-9,11-tetradecadienyl acetate relative to natural compound was significantly higher during the light period. Label incorporation from different intermediates into the pheromone was stimulated by injection of brain-subesophageal ganglion extract during the photophase. The influence of the pheromone biosynthesis-activating neuropeptide on the biosynthetic pathway is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1584095986,"A new series of polypeptide presynaptic antagonists (omega-agatoxins) was purified from venom of the funnel web spider Agelenopsis aperta. Physiological data indicate that all of these peptides are antagonists of voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Although all three omega-agatoxins (Aga) described here (omega-Aga-IA, omega-Aga-IB, and omega-Aga-IIA) block insect neuromuscular transmission presynaptically, biochemical data permit their subclassification as Type I and Type II toxins. Type I toxins (omega-Aga-IA and -IB) are 7.5 kDa, have closely related amino acid sequences, and exhibit characteristic tryptophan-like UV absorbance spectra. Complete Edman sequencing of omega-Aga-IA reveals it to be a 66-amino acid polypeptide containing 9 cysteines and 5 tryptophan residues. omega-Aga-IIA, a Type II toxin, is 11 kDa, shows limited amino acid sequence similarity to the Type I toxins, and exhibits mixed tryptophan- and tyrosine-like absorbance. Nanomolar concentrations of omega-Aga-IIA inhibit the specific binding of 125I-labeled omega-conotoxin GVIA to chick synaptosomal membranes while omega-Aga-IA and -IB have no effect under identical conditions. The omega-agatoxins thus are defined as two subtypes of neuronal calcium channel toxins with different structural characteristics and calcium channel binding specificities."
https://openalex.org/W1554154613,"The properties and distribution of nonaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate transferase in rat liver were investigated with subcellular fractions, liver perfusion, and in vivo labeling with [3H]solanesyl-PP. In addition to some ubiquinone-9, only one labeled intermediate, i.e. nonaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate, was obtained. In the total microsomal fraction, the enzyme had a pH optimum of 7.5 and was completely inhibited by Triton X-100 and deoxycholate, but not by taurodeoxycholate and beta-octyl glucoside. Liver, kidney, and spleen demonstrated the highest activities of nonaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate transferase. Upon subcellular fractionation, high specific activities were found in smooth II microsomes and Golgi III vesicles. The enzyme was also found in lysosomes and plasma membranes, but only at low levels in rough and smooth I microsomes and mitochondria and not at all in peroxisomes and cytosol. When the product of the transferase reaction was used as a substrate in vitro and in a perfusion system, the only product obtained was end product ubiquinone-9. Although the transferase reaction was associated with the inner, luminal surface of microsomal vesicles, the terminal reaction(s) for ubiquinone-9 synthesis are found at the outer cytoplasmic surface. The results suggest that the major site for ubiquinone synthesis is the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi system, which also participates in the distribution of ubiquinone-9 to other cellular membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2101723197,"Two major protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes, accounting for approximately 95% of the total activity in human neutrophils, were separated by hydroxyapatite chromatography and were identified as beta-PKC (60% of the total) and alpha-PKC (35% of the total). No gamma-PKC was detected. A minor Ca2+/phospholipid requiring kinase that eluted from hydroxyapatite after alpha-PKC did not react significantly with any of the specific antisera employed for identification. Modification of beta-PKC or the minor PKC isozyme by calpain yielded Ca2+/phospholipid-independent forms (PKM) that retained only 50% of the original activities. In contrast, PKM formed from alpha-PKC retained full catalytic activity. For each native isozyme the rate of conversion by calpain was accelerated in the presence of Ca2+ and the lipid effectors, and the PKM form generated in each case was resistant to further digestion by calpain. All three PKC isozymes were also modified by a neutral serine proteinase isolated from human neutrophils, with this proteinase the major effect being loss of kinase activity, via a transient production of a Ca2+/phospholipid-independent form. This neutral serine proteinase appears to be localized at sites of interaction of cytoskeletal proteins with the cell membrane. Following stimulation of intact neutrophils with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate complete loss of native cytosolic kinase activity was observed, with recovery of approximately 30% of the original activity as a cytosolic Ca+/phospholipid independent form, presumably PKM. Loss of native PKC activity was greatest for the beta-isozyme. In cells stimulated by fMet-Leu-Phe approximately 60% of the original PKC activity was recovered as native cytosolic PKC and 30% as cytosolic PKM. Inhibitors of calpain reduced the extent of down-regulation of PKC, increased the proportion of PKC that remained associated with the plasma membrane and significantly reduced the proteolytically generated fully active PKM. Taken together, the in vitro and in vivo results suggest that calpain is involved primarily in the conversion of the PKC isozymes to the irreversibly activated PKM forms, and that the neutral serine proteinase may be the enzyme responsible for down-regulation, possibly via PKM as an intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1643136010,"Patients with autosomal recessive abetalipoproteinemia (ABL) lack in their plasma all lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein (apo)B-100 or B-48. Previous studies have suggested that this is due to the complete absence of apoB. We have investigated whether such patients (n = 10) are able to secrete the lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a] glycoprotein (apo(a] which, in normal plasma, exists as a complex with low density lipoproteins containing apoB-100 (Lp(a) lipoprotein). All 10 patients had reduced but detectable apo(a) levels in plasma (mean, 0.49 mg/dl; range, 0.2-2.03 mg/dl) but no Lp(a) lipoprotein. However, we also detected small amounts (0.2-2.8 mg/dl) of apoB in all patients with ABL. The apoB in the ABL patients had the size of apoB-100 and occurred as a lipid-poor complex with the Lp(a) glycoprotein in a fraction of density 1.22 g/ml. This material may represent partially assembled Lp(a) lipoprotein. There was also uncomplexed apo(a) and apoB-100 in the ABL plasma. The distribution and relative concentration of both proteins in the density fraction greater than 1.06 g/ml varied among patients. The data suggest that in ABL, the assembly of apoB-containing lipoproteins is defective and that apoB-100 may be secreted without its full lipid complement when complexed with apo(a)."
https://openalex.org/W1595518633,"Inhibition of deoxyribonuclease I activity was used to assay the actin monomers and the pointed ends of actin filaments in lysates of Dictyostelium discoideum. The KD for the binding reaction was 0.2-0.3 nM. Total cellular actin was 93 microM in monomers (approximately 0.1 fmol/cell) of which roughly half was initially polymeric. Essentially all of the filamentous actin (F-actin) was readily pelleted in the microcentrifuge and was therefore presumed to be in the cytoskeleton. Free F-actin barbed ends, measured as pelletable [3H]cytochalasin B, numbered 1.8 x 10(5)/cell; nuclei for the polymerization of rabbit muscle globular (monomeric) actin numbered 2.0 x 10(5)/cell; and pointed ends, determined by their inhibition of deoxyribonuclease I, numbered 3.6 x 10(5)/cell. These values suggest that half the barbed ends might be occluded. On average, the filaments contained approximately 76 subunits and were therefore about 0.2 micron long. The distribution of their lengths was estimated from the time course of depolymerization following vast dilution. Three populations were defined. In one experiment, the smallest population contained 71% of the F-actin mass and 96% of the pointed ends; these filaments averaged 80 subunits or 0.22 microns in length. An intermediate population contained 14% of the F-actin mass and 3% of the filaments; these were roughly 460 subunits (1.3 microns) long. The largest population contained 15% of the F-actin mass in about 0.3% of the filaments; these were 13 microns in length, about the diameter of the cell. The numerous short filaments might populate a cortical mesh, while the long filaments might constitute endoplasmic bundles."
https://openalex.org/W1592367786,"The Asn-linked oligosaccharides from bovine lutropin (bLH(Pit] are predominantly dibranched complex-type structures with the terminal sequence SO4-4GalNAc beta 1,4GlcNAc beta 1,2Man alpha. Recombinant bLH expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (bLH(CHO] bears di- (60%) and tribranched (30%) complex-type oligosaccharides; however, these terminate in the sequence Sia alpha 2,3Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc beta 1,2Man alpha. In contrast to the limited spectrum of oligosaccharide structures present on recombinant bLH(CHO), the endogenous glycoproteins synthesized by CHO cells bear a heterogeneous array of Asn-linked oligosaccharides with 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 sialic acid moieties. The sialic acid moieties on the Asn-linked oligosaccharides of both endogenous glycoproteins and recombinant bLH(CHO) are exclusively alpha 2,3-linked, suggesting that the alpha 2,6-sialyl-transferase is not active in CHO cells. The bioactivities of bLH(Pit) and bLH(CHO) were compared using MA-10 cells following sequential digestion with neuraminidase and beta-galactosidase. Neither the ED50 (dose producing 50% of the maximum response) for progesterone production (7.2 ng/ml) nor the Pmax (maximum level of progesterone produced) (470 ng/ml) was altered for bLH(Pit) by these treatments, consistent with the absence of either sialic acid or Gal on bLH(Pit). The ED50 for progesterone production by recombinant bLH(CHO) (16.4 ng/ml) was significantly greater than for bLH(Pit) but was reduced to 5.3 ng/ml following removal of terminal sialic acid. Removal of the subterminal Gal was without further effect. The Pmax for bLH(CHO) (180 ng/ml) was not altered by these treatments. The reduction in bLH(CHO) bioactivity caused by the presence of terminal sialic acid suggests that the presence of terminal sulfate on bLH(Pit) oligosaccharides may also reduce its bioactivity and may play a modulatory role in regulating hormone bioactivity."
https://openalex.org/W1532314368,"We have utilized multinuclear NMR spectroscopy to examine the relationship between cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]in), free Mg2+ ([Mg2+]in) and intracellular Na+ ([Na+]in) levels of the intact thoracic aorta and primary hypertension using the Wistar-Kyoto and Sprague-Dawley rats as controls and the spontaneously hypertensive rat as a model for genetic hypertension. Cytosolic free [Ca2+] was measured using 19F NMR of the intracellular Ca2+ indicator 5,5'-difluoro-1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, free [Mg2+] using the 31P resonances of intracellular ATP, and intracellular [Na+] by 23Na NMR in combination with the extracellular shift reagent dysprosium tripolyphosphate. We have found that both the [Na+]in and [Ca2+]in levels were significantly increased in the hypertensive animals relative to normotensive controls (p less than 0.01). Mean systolic blood pressures (using tail cuff method) of control and hypertensive rats were 123 +/- 8 mm Hg (mean +/- 2 S.E., n = 7) and 159 +/- 6 mm Hg (mean +/- 2 S.E., n = 7), respectively. [Na+]in and [Ca2+]in were 21.9 +/- 6.4 mM (mean +/- 2 S.E., n = 7) and 277 +/- 28 nM (mean +/- 2 S.E., n = 5) for the spontaneously hypertensive rats versus 10.1 +/- 1.8 mM (mean +/- 2 S.E., n = 7) and 151 +/- 26 nM (mean +/- 2 S.E., n = 5) for control rats, respectively. A slight difference observed between intracellular free Mg2+ levels in hypertensives (180 +/- 38 microM, mean +/- 2 S.E., n = 4) and controls (246 +/- 76 microM, mean +/- 2 S.E., n = 4) was not statistically significant (p greater than 0.1). These data indicate alterations in the cell membrane ion transport function of the aortic smooth muscle in primary hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W1550680550,"Human neutrophils pretreated with 17-hydroxywortmannin responded to the chemotactic agonist formyl-Met-Leu-Phe with a transient doubling in filamentous actin content which was characterized by prominent oscillations. These oscillations closely matched transient oscillations in suspension turbidity measured in parallel. The experimental data could be simulated using A----B----C stochastic series kinetic models with an oscillating intermediate species (B), allowing quantitative comparison of the frequencies of the oscillations (0.092 +/- 0.006 and 0.094 +/- 0.004 Hz) and the overall reaction rate constants for actin mobilization and turbidity changes (0.11 +/- 0.02 and 0.14 +/- 0.03 s-1, respectively). The total cell volume remained constant, indicating that stimulus-induced extension of lamellipods reduces the body volume by an amount proportional to the mass displaced outward. Light scattering theory predicts that a decrease in body size decreases the turbidity and that fluctuations in body size due to lamellipod extension and retraction cycles like those exhibited by crawling neutrophils result in turbidity oscillations (lamellipods scatter very little by comparison to the cell body, and both aggregation and degranulation were absent). The experiments thus suggest that the cyclic variations in F-actin content are correlated with periodic fluctuations in lamellipod size. The available evidence appears to be consistent with the hypothesis that actin polymerization provides the main driving force for lamellipod extension and that depolymerization causes lamellipod retraction."
https://openalex.org/W1592864469,"Three fish species with different strategies for anoxic survival (goldfish, tilapia, and common carp) were exposed to environmental anoxia (4, 3, and 1 h, respectively). The concentrations of high energy phosphate compounds and inorganic phosphate, besides the intracellular pH in the epaxial muscle were measured during anoxia and recovery by in vivo 31P NMR spectroscopy. The concentration of free ADP was calculated from the equilibrium constant of creatine kinase. During anoxia the patterns of phosphocreatine utilization and tissue acidification are remarkedly similar. Free ADP rises rapidly during the initial period of oxygen deficiency and reaches a plateau in goldfish and tilapia, while it keeps rising in the common carp. At elevated levels of free ADP, the creatine kinase reaction and anaerobic glycolysis are functionally coupled by H+ as a common intermediate. The coupling between both processes disappears upon reoxygenation, when mitochondrial respiration induces a rapid drop of [free ADP]. The removal of ADP shifts the creatine kinase equilibrium toward phosphocreatine synthesis despite the low pH."
https://openalex.org/W1547374361,"Structural features at extra thymidine bulge sites in DNA duplexes have been elucidated from a two-dimensional NMR analysis of through-bond and through-space connectivities in the otherwise self-complementary d(C-C-G-T-G-A-A-T-T-C-C-G-G) (GTG 13-mer) and d(C-C-G-G-A-A-T-T-C-T-C-G-G) (CTC 13-mer) duplexes in aqueous solution. These studies establish that the extra thymidine flanked by guanosines in the GTG 13-mer duplex is in a conformational equilibrium between looped out and stacked states. The looped-out state is favored at low temperature (0 degrees C), whereas the equilibrium shifts in favor of the stacked state at elevated temperatures (35 degrees C) prior to the onset of the duplex-strand transition. By contrast, the extra thymidine flanked by cytidines in the CTC 13-mer duplex is looped out independent of temperature in the duplex state. Our results demonstrate that temperature and flanking sequence modulate the equilibrium between looped-out and stacked conformations of single base thymidine bulges in DNA oligomer duplexes."
https://openalex.org/W1485799257,"In our previous report, we described the structural organizations of glycophorin A and B genes (Kudo, S., and Fukuda, M. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 4619-4623). During the course of isolation of these genomic clones, we also obtained genomic clones encoding a novel glycophorin. This novel glycophorin, termed glycophorin E (GPE), has a similar genomic structure to that of the GPB gene, and its nucleotide sequence is almost identical to that of the GPB gene. These sequences include a region downstream of an Alu repeat sequence, which has been suggested to be a site for homologous recombination in the GPB gene during or after gene duplication. However, the predicted GPE amino acid sequence specifies blood group M, in contrast to GPB which carries blood group N. Polymerase chain reaction was employed to analyze the transcript of this gene, and its cDNA sequence revealed that the novel glycophorin gene encodes 78 amino acids, including a 19-residue leader peptide. Comparison of genomic and complementary DNAs demonstrates that this gene consists of four exons, and point mutations at sites corresponding to the 5'-splicing sites of intron 3 and intron 4 of the GPA gene lead to the joining of the exon 2 to potential exon 5. Interestingly, an insertion of 24 nucleotides coding for eight amino acid residues in-frame was found in exon 5. The predicted amino acid sequence within this exon indicates that it has a hydrophobic character, suggesting the possible expression of GPE as a membrane protein. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that this novel glycophorin gene is expressed in an erythroid-specific manner and coordinately down-regulated together with GPA and GPB genes by a tumor-promoting phorbol ester. During evolution, this gene might have derived from an ancestral gene common to the GPB gene by gene duplication and subsequent nucleotide substitutions, and constitutes a member of a gene family with GPA and GPB genes."
https://openalex.org/W1567256313,"The Cosmos 1887 biosatellite carried 10 male rats and 2 rhesus monkeys on its 12.5-day mission. Upon re-entry the Vostok vehicle overshot the designated landing site, which resulted in fasting of the animals for 42 h, exposure to cage temperatures of 12-15 degrees C, and 2 days delay in death of the rats. No overt untoward effects of the delayed recovery were apparent. Tissues from the rats were harvested by Soviet scientists, appropriately preserved, and provided to U.S. investigators. Flight rats grew more slowly and had larger adrenal glands than earth gravity controls. Analysis of plasma revealed increased concentrations of hepatic alkaline phosphatase, glucose, urea nitrogen, and creatinine in flight rats. In contrast, electrolytes, total protein, albumin, corticosterone, prolactin, and immunoreactive growth hormone levels were unchanged. However, testosterone concentration was marginally decreased after flight and thyroid hormone levels were suggestive of reduced thyroid function. Due to the possible effects of reentry and the delay in recovery of the animals, it is not clear what relationship postflight levels of plasma constituents bear to their concentrations in flight."
https://openalex.org/W1574021748,"Three isozymes of catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (pyrocatechase) from Pseudomonas arvilla C-1 were separated using DEAE-Toyopearl chromatography. The specific activities of each isozyme were similar to one another. The molecular weights of isozymes 1, 2, and 3 were estimated to be approximately 67,000, 64,000, and 59,000, respectively, from gel filtration. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isozymes 1 and 3 gave a single protein band, corresponding to Mr = 32,000 and 30,000, respectively, and isozyme 2 gave two bands corresponding to Mr = 32,000 and 30,000. These results indicated that isozymes 1 and 3 were homodimers, while isozyme 2 was a heterodimer. The NH2-terminal sequences up to 20 residues of these three isozymes confirmed that isozymes 1, 2, and 3 consisted of beta beta, alpha beta, and alpha alpha, respectively, based on our previous data (Nakai, C., Kagamiyama, H., Saeki, Y., and Nozaki, M. (1979) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 195, 12-22). Properties of these isozymes such as absorption spectrum, iron content, substrate specificity, and kinetic constants were similar to one another. Subunit exchange between the different isozymes and dissociation of the isozymes into subunits was not observed under nondenaturing conditions. Available evidence indicates that these isozymes exist naturally in the bacterium and were not due to artifacts caused by purification."

The proteins resemble the camphor 5-exohydroxylase components in chemical and physical properties; however, they show neither immunological cross-reactivity nor catalytic activity in heterogenous recombination.

https://openalex.org/W1555954903,"Rates of NO uptake by five denitrifying bacteria were estimated by NO-electrode and gas chromatography methods under conditions of rather low cell densities and [NOaq]. The rates so measured, VmaxNO, represent lower limits for the true value of that parameter, but nevertheless exceed Vmax for nitrite uptake, VmaxNi, by a factor of two typically. Previous estimates under suboptimal conditions had placed VmaxNO at 0.3-0.5 of VmaxNi (St. John, R. T., and Hollocher, T. C. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 212-218; Garber, E. A. E., and Hollocher, T.C. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 5459-5465). The steady-state [NOaq] during denitrification of nitrite by nitrate-grown cells was less than or equal to 1 microM. The above observations, taken with a recent direct estimate for the KmNO for NO uptake of 0.4 microM (Zafiriou, O. C., Hanley, Q. S., and Snyder, G. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 5694-5699), would allow NO to be a free intermediate between nitrite and N2O with steady-state concentrations of less than or equal to 0.4 microM. As the result of special conditions during cell growth or differential inhibition by azide, it was possible to establish systems that accumulated NO during denitrification of nitrite. In all such cases, VmaxNO less than VmaxNi, and the time required to reach the maximum [NOaq] corresponded closely to the time needed to exhaust the nitrite. A semiquantitative isotope experiment with Paracoccus denitrificans demonstrated the trapping of 15NO from 15NO2- in a pool of NOaq. A quantitative isotope method using low densities of the same bacterium showed that 15N from 15NO2- and 14N from NOg combine randomly to form N2O during the simultaneous denitrification of 15NO2- and NO. The result requires that the pathways from nitrite and NO share a common mononitrogen intermediate. Results to the contrary obtained at high cell densities (first two references cited above) are now believed to have been due to technical artifacts. The present results are consistent with the view that NO is under kinetic control as a free intermediate in denitrification and serve to remove previously imagined constraints on this view."
https://openalex.org/W1482428260,"Comparative and phylogenetic analyses of homologous sequences from closely related species reveal genetic events which have happened in the past and thus provide considerable insight into molecular genetic processes. One such process which has been especially important in the evolution of multigene families is gene conversion. The fetal gamma 1 and gamma 2-globin genes of catarrhine primates (humans, apes, and Old World monkeys) underwent numerous gene conversion events after they arose from a gene duplication event 25-35 million years ago. By including the gamma 1- and gamma 2-globin gene sequences from the common gibbon, Hylobates lar, the present work expands the gamma-globin data set to represent all major groups of hominoid primates. A computer-assisted algorithm is introduced which reveals converted DNA segments and provides results very similar to those obtained by site-by-site evolutionary reconstruction. Both methods provide strong evidence for at least 14 different converted stretches in catarrhine primates as well as five conversions in ancestral lineages. Features of gene conversions generalized from this molecular history are 1) conversions are restricted to regions maintaining high degrees of sequence similarity, 2) one gene may dominate in converting another gene, 3) sequences involved in conversions may accumulate changes more rapidly than expected, and 4) certain elements, such as polypurine/polypyrimidine [Y)n) and (TG)n elements, appear to be hotspots for initiating or terminating conversion events."

Humeri of age-matched basal control, synchronous control, and vivarium control rats were contrasted with the flight bones to examine the influence of growth and space environment on bone development. Lack of humerus longitudinal growth occurred during the 12.5 days in spaceflight. In addition, the normal mid-diaphysial periosteal appositional growth was affected; compared with their controls, the spaceflight humeri had less cortical cross-sectional area, smaller periosteal circumferences, smaller anterior-posterior periosteal diameters, and smaller second moments of area with respect to the bending and nonbending axes. The flexural rigidity of the flight humeri was comparable to that of the younger basal control rats and significantly less than that of the synchronous and vivarium controls; the elastic moduli of all four groups, nonetheless, were not significantly different. Generally, the matrix biochemistry of the mid-diaphysial cross sections showed no differences among groups. Thus, the spaceflight differences in humeral mechanical strength and flexural rigidity were probably a result of the differences in humeral geometry rather than material properties.—Vailas, A.

Mutations at Pro48 were found to cause only slight changes in the kon (human: 3.1 +/- 0.3 x 10(8) M-1 s-1; bovine: 1.03 +/- 0.3 x 10(8) M-1 s-1) and koff (human: 0.4 +/- 0.2 x 10(-3) s-1; bovine: 2.9 +/- 0.4 x 10(-3) s-1) rate constants for the formation of the thrombin-hirudin complex. The amino-terminal fragment Ala48-hirudin1-47 containing the three disulfide bridges and the carboxyl-terminal fragment Ala48-hirudin48-65 were derived from the Ala48 mutant by proteolysis with endoproteinase Lys-C. These fragments inhibit bovine alpha-thrombin clotting activity with IC50 values of 0.6 and 4.9 microM, respectively (2.4 nM for r-hirudin). By mapping the interaction of Ala48-hirudin-derived fragments with bovine alpha-thrombin by limited proteolysis with trypsin and pancreatic elastase distinct binding sites for each fragment were determined. The carboxyl-terminal fragment was found to bind to the proposed anion-binding exosite in the region B62-74, whereas the amino-terminal fragment binds to a region around the elastase cleavage site at residues 150-151 of the alpha-thrombin B-chain."
https://openalex.org/W1593159135,"We combined biochemical measurements with novel techniques for image analysis in the rat femur to characterize the location and nature of the defect in mineralization known to occur in growing animals after spaceflight. Concentrations of mineral and osteocalcin were low in the distal half of the diaphysis and concentrations of collagen were low with evidence of increased synthesis in the proximal half of the diaphysis of the flight bones. X-ray microtomography provided semiquantitative data in computer-generated sections of whole wet bone that indicated a longitudinal gradient of decreasing mineralization toward the distal diaphysis, similar to the chemistry results. Analysis of embedded sections by backscattered electrons in a scanning electron microscope revealed distinct patterns of mineral distribution in the proximal, central, and distal regions of the diaphysis and also showed a net reduction in mineral levels toward the distal shaft. Increases in mineral density to higher fractions in controls were less in the flight bones at all three levels, with the most distal cross-sectional area most affected. The combined results from these novel techniques identified the areas of femoral diaphysis most vulnerable to the mineralization defect associated with spaceflight and/or the stress of landing.—Mechanic, G.

https://openalex.org/W1553281691,"The thermal and the urea-induced unfolding profiles of the coiled-coil alpha-helix of native and refolded tropomyosin from chicken gizzard were studied by circular dichroism. Refolding of tropomyosin at low temperature from alpha + beta subunits, dissociated by guanidinium chloride, urea, or high temperature, predominantly produced alpha alpha + beta beta homodimers in agreement with earlier studies of refolding from guanidinium chloride (Graceffa, P. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 1282-1287). The presence of two unfolding transitions in low salt solutions with about equal helix loss verified the composition with the first unfolding transition of the homodimer mixture originating from alpha alpha. In contrast, refolding by equilibrating at temperatures close to physiological, however, produced the native alpha beta heterodimer, which unfolded in a single transition. The refolding kinetics of dissociated alpha + beta subunits indicated that beta beta homodimers form first, leading to alpha alpha homodimers both of which are relatively stable against chain exchange below approximately 25 degrees C. Equilibrating the homodimer mixture at 37-40 degrees C for long times, however, produced the native alpha beta molecule via chain exchange. The equilibria involved indicate that the free energy of formation from subunits of alpha beta is much less than that of (alpha alpha + beta beta)/2. In vivo folding of alpha beta from the two separate alpha and beta gene products is, therefore, thermodynamically favored over the formation of homodimers and biological factors need not be considered to explain the native preferred alpha beta composition."

Among the parameters measured, the major differences were elevations in the glycogen content and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase activities for the rats flown on Cosmos 1887 and decreases in the amount of microsomal cytochrome P-450 and the activities of aniline hydroxylase and ethylmorphine N-demethylase, cytochrome P-450-dependent enzymes. These results support the earlier finding of differences in these parameters and suggest that altered hepatic function could be important during spaceflight and/or the postflight recovery period."
https://openalex.org/W1608575135,"Interactions of types I, II, and III protein kinase C (PKC) with phospholipids were investigated by following the changes in protein kinase activity and phorbol ester binding. The acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidic acid, phosphatidyl-glycerol, and cardiolipin, which are activators of PKC in the assay of protein phosphorylation, could differentially inactivate PKC I, II, and III during preincubation in the absence of divalent cation. The phospholipid-induced inactivation of PKC was concentration and time dependent and only affected the kinase activity without influencing phorbol ester binding. PKC I was the most susceptible to the phospholipid-induced inactivation, and PKC III was the least. The IC50 values of PS for PKC I, II, and III were 5, 45, and greater than 120 microM, respectively. Addition of divalent cation such as Ca2+ or Mg2+ suppressed the phospholipid-induced inactivation of PKC. In the absence of divalent cation, PKC I, II, and III all formed complexes with PS vesicles, although to a slightly different degree, as analyzed by molecule sieve chromatography. [3H]Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding for PKC I, II, and III was recovered after chromatography; however, the kinase activities of all these enzymes were greatly reduced. In the presence of Ca2+, all three PKCs formed complexes with PS vesicles, and both the kinase and phorbol ester-binding activities of PKC II and III were recovered following chromatography. Under the same conditions, the phorbol ester-binding activity of PKC I was also recovered, but the kinase activity was not. The phospholipid-induced inactivation of PKC apparently results from a direct interaction of phospholipid with the catalytic domain of PKC; this interaction can be suppressed by divalent cations. In the presence of divalent cations, PS interacted preferentially with the regulatory domain of PKC and resulted in the activation of the kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1505377984,"A major energy source in brain is glucose, which is committed to metabolism by hexokinase (Type I isozyme), an enzyme usually considered to be bound to the outer membrane. In this study, the subcellular location of hexokinase in brain has been rigorously investigated. Mitochondrial fractions containing hexokinase (greater than 500 milliunits/mg protein) were prepared by two different procedures, and then subjected to density gradient centrifugation before and after loading with barium phosphate, a technique designed to increase the density of the mitochondria. The gradient distribution patterns of both unloaded and loaded preparations show that brain hexokinase does not distribute exclusively with marker enzymes. This is particularly evident in the loaded preparations where there is a clear distinction between the peak activities of hexokinase and markers. The same observation was made when the of either untreated or barium phosphate-loaded mitochondria was subjected to titration with digitonin. In fact, at concentrations of digitonin, which almost completely solubilize marker enzymes for both the inner and outer membranes, a significant of the total hexokinase remains particulate bound. Electron microscopy confirmed that particulate material is still present under these conditions. Significantly, hexokinase is released from particulate material only at high concentrations of digitonin which solubilize the associated microsomal marker NADPH-cytochrome c reductase. Glucose 6-phosphate, which is known to release hexokinase from the brain mitochondrial fraction also releases hexokinase from this unidentified particulate component. These results on brain, a normal glucose utilizing tissue, differ from those obtained previously on highly glycolytic tumor cells where identical subfractionation procedures revealed a strictly outer membrane location for particulate hexokinase (Parry, D. M., and Pedersen, P. L. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10904-10912). It is concluded that in brain, hexokinase has a greater propensity to localize at nonmitochondrial receptor sites than to those known to be associated with the outer membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1554349383,"The early fate specification of primary mesenchyme cells in sea urchin embryos makes them an attractive system for studying alterations in gene expression and protein synthesis during cell lineage determination and differentiation. To analyze the developmental regulation of gene expression in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, we have isolated and sequenced genomic and cDNA clones encoding msp 130, a mesenchyme-specific cell surface glycoprotein. We have located the transcription initiation site of the msp130 gene and sequenced several kilobases of the promoter region. The region of the gene that encodes the protein is divided into numerous small (less than 500 base pairs) exons. The msp130 protein possesses two novel glycine-rich domains and a signal peptide, but apparently lacks a transmembrane domain. The carboxyl-terminal sequence suggests that msp130 may be phosphatidylinositol-linked to the cell membrane, and experiments with phospholipases support this conclusion. The implications of the msp130 sequence for its possible functions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1526866619,"Bovine adrenal chromaffin cells were exposed to phorbol esters to determine the effects of reduced levels of protein kinase C on secretion of hormones. Treatment with active phorbol esters such as 4 beta-phorbol 12, 13-didecanoate (PDD) reduced levels of protein kinase C activity with a maximal 80-90% reduction in activity after 16-24 h treatment (greater than or equal to 500 nM PDD). Treatment with PDD also inhibited catecholamine secretion from chromaffin cells evoked by nicotine, barium, and scorpion venom (50-70%, t1/2 approximately 6 h) and by veratridine (80%, t1/2 less than 15 min). Secretion induced by these agents in phorbol ester-treated cells returned to that of untreated cells by 3-4 days despite no recovery of protein kinase C activity. Potassium-evoked secretion was not inhibited by phorbol ester treatment. Catecholamine secretion from digitonin-permeabilized cells was more sensitive to calcium between 1 and 24 h, but not greater than or equal to 48 h, after addition of phorbol ester. The results suggest that phorbol esters inhibit secretion by activation of protein kinase C resulting in inhibition of ion channels or receptors but not of the secretory machinery itself; hence, protein kinase C may usually machinery itself; hence, protein kinase C may usually attenuate secretory responses in the adrenal chromaffin cell."
https://openalex.org/W1587121765,"Human C3b/C4b receptor or complement receptor type one (CR1) is one of a family of receptor and regulatory glycoproteins that are encoded at a single genetic region (1q32) and are composed largely of a tandemly repeated motif (short consensus repeat or SCR) of approximately 60 amino acids. In addition, CR1 features an internal homology of seven SCRs in length, known as a long homologous repeat, that is reiterated four times, in the major polymorphic size variant, from SCR-1 to SCR-28, and may be reiterated three, five, and six times in other polymorphic forms. In the course of studying CR1, we detected sequences closely related to CR1 on several overlapping genomic clones. We have characterized a 40-kilobase CR1-like genomic region containing 10 potential exons that are 95% homologous to the amino-terminal coding portion of CR1. This region appears to be a partial duplication of CR1 and may encode a related gene. A comparison of CR1 and CR1-like sequences suggests that unequal crossing-over and concerted evolution have occurred within the most precisely reiterated subregion of CR1. Similar mechanisms have been important in the evolution of tandemly repeated genes and could provide the means for generation of the CR1 polymorphic size variants."
https://openalex.org/W1634021026,"Angiotensin II (ang II) induces c-fos gene expression in part via a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). However, little is known about the mechanisms by which protein kinase C regulates nuclear functions. We examined the ability of ang II to phosphorylate nuclear lamina proteins in VSMC and the possibility that protein kinase C is involved in these putative phosphorylation events. Ang II stimulated the phosphorylation of Triton X-100- and high salt-insoluble nuclear envelope proteins with molecular weights of 70,000, 67,000, and 60,000. These proteins were identified as lamins A, B, and C, respectively, based on their mobilities on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and interaction with antibodies to lamins as detected by immunoblot analyses. After a 2-min delay, phosphorylation levels of lamins increased, peaked at 20-30 min, and were sustained for at least 60 min after ang II stimulation. The threshold, half-maximal, and maximal concentrations of ang II which induced phosphorylation of lamins were 0.1, 0.5-1, and 100 nM, respectively. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also induced these reactions, whereas ionomycin did not. Down-regulation of protein kinase C by prolonged treatment with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate attenuated ang II-induced phosphorylation of lamins. In vitro phosphorylation of nuclear envelope proteins by protein kinase C revealed that lamins served as substrates for this enzyme. These results indicate that ang II induces phosphorylation of lamins in cultured VSMC and suggest that protein kinase C is either directly or indirectly involved in these reactions. The results raise the possibility that phosphorylation of nuclear proteins is one of the important steps by which the protein kinase C signaling pathway regulates agonist-induced nuclear events."
https://openalex.org/W1540403838,"A novel protein which represents the most abundant calmodulin-binding protein in bovine heart cytosolic fraction was purified to apparent homogeneity. The purification procedure involved DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (to remove calmodulin), calmodulin-Sepharose 4B affinity, and Sepharose 6B column chromatographies. This purified calmodulin-binding protein is a highly asymmetric protein with a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 5.0 S and a Stokes radius of about 83.0 A. The molecular weight of the calmodulin-binding protein was determined to be 175,000 from the sedimentation constant and Stokes radius of the protein. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the protein showed a single protein band with an apparent molecular weight of 140,000. The result suggests that the protein is monomeric. Although this molecular weight is similar to that of caldesmon, a known ubiquitous calmodulin-binding protein, the protein did not react with caldesmon-specific antibodies, nor did it display a proteolytic fragmentation pattern similar to that of the former. In addition, caldesmon was found almost exclusively in the particulate fraction in low ionic strength cardiac muscle extract, whereas this protein is purified the soluble fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1593751301,"Using a series of gene-specific oligonucleotide probes, we have explored the developmental pattern of expression of six members of the rat kallikrein gene family (PS, S1, S2, S3, K1, and P1) in the submandibular gland (SMG) and kidney of both sexes, the prostate and testis of the male, and the anterior pituitary gland (AP) of the female rat. PS (true kallikrein) mRNA was detected in early neonatal life in the SMG and kidney of both sexes. K1, a second kallikrein gene family member expressed in the adult kidney, had a developmental pattern similar to PS in the kidney. In contrast, tonin (S2), S3, K1, and P1, all of which are expressed in the adult SMG, did not reach detectable SMG mRNA levels until puberty in either the male or female rat. Both S3 and P1, which are expressed in the adult prostate, and the novel P1-like mRNA previously detected in the adult rat testis, first appeared in early puberty. In the female AP, PS mRNA levels were not detected until early puberty and thus exhibited a developmental profile different from that of prolactin. The demonstration that S1, S2, S3, P1, and K1 are not expressed in the SMG or prostate until puberty is consistent with the expression of these genes in these tissues being androgen-regulated; the first appearance of PS mRNA in the female AP in early puberty similarly reflects the estrogen dependence of PS gene expression in this tissue. The presence of PS mRNA levels in the SMG and kidney prior to sexual maturation reflects the androgen independence of PS gene expression and suggests that PS (true kallikrein) may play a constitutive and/or developmental role in SMG or renal physiology."

While many normal myofibrils were observed, others exhibited ultrastructural alterations, i.e., damaged and irregular-shaped mitochondria and generalized myofibrillar edema. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the volume density data revealed a statistically significant increase in glycogen and a significant decrease in mitochondria compared to the synchronous and vivarium controls. Point counting indicated an increase in lipid and myeloid bodies and a decrease in microtubules, but these changes were not statistically significant. In addition, the flight animals exhibited some patchy loss of protofibrils (actin and myosin filaments) and some abnormal supercontracted myofibrils that were not seen in the controls. This study was undertaken to gain insight into the mechanistic aspects of cardiac changes in both animals and human beings as a consequence of space travel (1).

Values of 49 s-1 and 7.5 microM were determined (at 37 degrees C, pH 7.4, gamma/2 0.17) for kcat and Km, respectively. Studies of the effect of fibrin I on alpha-thrombin-catalyzed hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate N-p-Tos-Gly-L-Pro-L-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (tos-GPR-amc) and the effect of fibrin I on the reaction of alpha-thrombin with antithrombin III (AT) were presented which indicate that the active site of alpha-thrombin is accessible while it is bound to its substrate fibrin I. Fibrin I inhibited alpha-thrombin-catalyzed hydrolysis of tos-GPR-amc in a manner inconsistent with the pure competitive inhibition expected for an alternative substrate, whereas fibrinogen, an alpha-thrombin substrate, behaved as a pure competitive inhibitor of the alpha-thrombin-catalyzed hydrolysis of tos-GPR-amc. The effect of fibrin I on alpha-thrombin-catalyzed hydrolysis of tos-GPR-amc was shown to be consistent with alpha-thrombin binding to fibrin I in alternative orientations. In one orientation both the active site and a site distinct from the active site (an exosite) of alpha-thrombin are occupied by fibrin I. In the other orientation only the exosite of alpha-thrombin is occupied and the active site is freely accessible to other substrates. The values of both kcat (21 s-1) and Km (less than 0.23 microM) determined for fibrin I-bound alpha-thrombin acting on tos-GPR-amc were decreased relative to the values of kcat (180 s-1) and Km (7.3 microM) observed for the action of uncomplexed alpha-thrombin on tos-GPR-amc. This observation suggests that the active site of alpha-thrombin is altered in fibrin I-bound alpha-thrombin. Studies of the effect of fibrin I on the reaction of AT with alpha-thrombin (at 37 degrees C, pH 7.4, gamma/2 0.17) indicated that when alpha-thrombin is bound to fibrin I in an orientation where the active site of alpha-thrombin is accessible, AT reacts with alpha-thrombin with a rate constant (greater than 4.2 x 10(4) M-1 s-1) that is greater than the rate constant (1.5 x 10(4) M-1 s-1) for reaction of AT with the free enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1582152210,"Previous studies have shown that the changes seen in the bones of growing rats exposed to microgravity are due in part to changes that occur in the growth plate during spaceflight. In this study, growth plates of rats flown aboard Cosmos 1887 (12.5-day flight plus 53.5-h recovery at 1 g) were analyzed using light and electron microscopy and computerized planimetry. The proliferative zone of flight animals was found to be significantly (P ≤ 0.01) larger than that of controls, while the reserve and hypertrophic/calcification zones were significantly reduced. Flight animals also had more cells per column in the proliferative zone than did controls and less in the hypertrophic/calcification region. The total number of cells, however, was significantly greater in flight animals. No difference was found in perimeter or in shape factor, but area was significantly less in flight animals. Electron microscopy showed that collagen fibrils in flight animals were wider than in controls. Since the time required for a cell to cycle through the growth plate is 2-3 days at 1 g, the results reported here represent both the effects of exposure to microgravity and the initial stages of recovery from that exposure.—Duke, P.

Nuclear morphometry was used as a marker for precursor cell differentiation in 3 μm sections cut in the midsagittal plane from the maxillary first molar. According to nuclear volume, cells were classified as pre-osteoblasts (C + D cells, ≥120 μm3) and less differentiated progenitor cells (A+A' cells, 40-79 μm3). Compared with synchronous controls (simulated flight conditions), the 55 h postflight recovery period at 1 g resulted in a 40% decrease in the A+A' cell population, a 42% increase in the C+D cells, and a 39% increase in the number of PDL fibroblastlike cells near the bone surface. These results are consistent with a postflight osteogenic response in PDL. This recovery response occurred despite physiological stress in the flight animals that resulted in a highly significant (P ≤ 0.001) increase in adrenal weight. The data suggest that after spaceflight there is a strong and rapid recovery mechanism for osteoblast differentiation that is not suppressed by physiological stress.— Garetto, L. P.; Gonsalves, M.

The predicted amino acid sequence of the chicken uPA primary translation product (434 residues) suggests a domain architecture comparable to the mammalian uPA proteins with the form: (i) signal peptide, (ii) growth factor domain (GF), (iii) kringle domain (K), and (iv) serine protease domain (C). The overall sequence identity between the chicken and human proteins is 43.1%, with 56.3, 48.5, and 45.6% identity in the GF, K, and C domains, respectively. The chicken uPA gene is similar to the mammalian uPA genes in both size (8158 base pairs between transcription initiation and polyadenylation sites) and organization (11 exons). However, the sequence of the chicken uPA gene is similar to the mammalian uPA genes only within the protein-coding portions of exons. The transcription initiation site is flanked by a remarkably G/C-rich region (77% between nucleotides -1 and -300) which contains a TATA element and several potential transcription factor Spl-binding sites. The promoter region also contains several repeat elements, including two 11-nucleotide repeats that encompass six potential transcription factor AP-2-binding sites.

To elucidate molecular mechanisms regulating metabolic coordination between the mitochondria and the cytosol, we analyzed the 5'-flanking regulatory regions of the complete set of mouse isoenzyme genes playing a pivotal role in the shuttle. Deletion analysis and an in vivo transfection assay, using NIH3T3 cells, revealed that all the promoter regions are located within the 300-base pair regions upstream from the initiation codon. Subsequently, DNase I footprinting analyses using NIH3T3 cell nuclear extracts led to identification of several protein binding sites within these promoter regions. A synthetic oligomer containing the consensus binding site sequence for CTF/NFI, a transcription factor for RNA polymerase II, competed for the binding of proteins to the promoter regions of cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase and mitochondrial and cytosolic malate dehydrogenase genes, but not for that of the mitochondrial aspartate amino-transferase gene.

https://openalex.org/W1592272229,"A strategy was designed to isolate mutants of glycyl-tRNA synthetase that are altered at the amino acid binding site, including a class with altered amino acid specificity. For this purpose, the plasmid pBR322 was mutated so that the codon (AGC) of the active site Ser-68 in the beta-lactamase gene was changed to the glycine codon GGC to inactivate the encoded enzyme. Suppressors that increase the amount of beta-lactamase activity of the Gly-68 allele of beta-lactamase were isolated and some mapped to the gene encoding glycyl-tRNA synthetase (glyS). While in vitro misaminoacylation of tRNA(Gly) with serine was not detected for any of the mutants, glycyl-tRNA synthetase activity was altered. One severely affected glyS mutant (N302) was studied in more detail. For this mutant, a single Pro-61----Leu substitution in the alpha chain confers an elevation of the Km values for glycine (25-fold) and for ATP (45-fold) in the aminoacylation reaction, but only a minor perturbation of the Km for tRNA. There also was a severely reduced adenylate synthesis activity (greater than 100-fold). In addition, a nonlinear dependence between aminoacylation activity and enzyme concentration was observed which implies that the alpha chain Pro-61----Leu mutation has disrupted the functionally essential subunit interactions of the holoenzyme. The results of the preceding paper have shown that the alpha chain and parts of the beta chain are required for aminoacylation and adenylate synthesis activity. The results of this study suggest that the alpha chain specifically contributes to amino acid and to ATP binding in a way that is affected by proper subunit interactions."

Bovine peptide sequences had five differences with the sequence derived from the bovine cDNA, and four of the changes could be accounted for by a single base change in the DNA. N-terminal sequence analysis of the bovine enzyme indicated that it contained two N termini, one of which is 3 amino acids longer than the other and begins with the sequence Ser-Ala-Pro. The amino acid sequences deduced from the bovine and human cDNAs are 19 and 25 amino acids longer, respectively, and these additional amino acids represent leader peptide sequences. Two bovine peptide sequences contained glycosylation sites and gave positive tests for carbohydrate residues, and two others contained the consensus sequence for a glycosylation site but were negative in the carbohydrate test. The bovine enzyme contains 6 Trp, as compared with 7 in the bovine cDNA and 8 in the human cDNA. The protein and bovine cDNA contain 24 Tyr each, as compared with 26 in the human cDNA. These numbers indicate that the true epsilon 1% 280 = 8.95, and, therefore, that it is 28% lower than the previously determined value.

(1985) Nature 317, 782-786). The changes generated include Thr-44 to Ala (T44A), Arg-54 to Leu (R54L), Arg-54 to Lys (R54K), Arg-84 to Leu (R84L), and Arg-84 to Lys (R84K). The mutant proteins were purified and characterized in detail for their binding properties. Both tryptophan and operator DNA affinities for all five mutants were decreased. The R84L, R54K, and R54L mutants exhibited increases in Kd for operator DNA relative to wild-type repressor ranging from approximately 10(3) to approximately 10(4), while R84K and T44A exhibited increases of 10- to 100-fold. This diminution in DNA binding activity derives at least in part from diminished affinity for tryptophan, although decreased affinity for nonspecific DNA was also observed for these mutant proteins. Tryptophan binding was not detectable by equilibrium dialysis for most of the mutant proteins, but this activity was measurable for several of the altered proteins by monitoring the fluorescence decrease associated with the displacement of 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate from the tryptophan-binding site (Chou, W.-Y., and Matthews, K. S. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 18314-18319). These measurements revealed that tryptophan bound to R84K, T44A, and R84L repressors with Kd values 1.5- to 13-fold higher than that for wild-type repressor. It was not possible to detect tryptophan binding to R54K and R54L even using the fluorescence assay. Circular dichroism spectra demonstrated that the mutants and the wild-type repressor possess similar secondary structural features. The results of this selected substitution in the tryptophan-binding site are readily interpreted based on the x-ray structural analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1561452283,"Ornithine aminotransferase (L-ornithine:2-oxo-acid aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.13)) has been purified to homogeneity from last instar larvae of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta (Sphingidae). This enzyme is a 144,000-Da tetramer constructed from 36,000-Da protomeric units. It has a high aspartate/asparagine and glutamate/glutamine content and 2 cysteine residues/subunit. All 8 cysteine residues can react with N-ethylmaleimide to inactivate the enzyme. Maintenance of the enzyme in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol maximizes enzymatic activity and improves storage conditions, presumably by protecting these sulfhydryl groups. The apparent Km values for L-ornithine and 2-oxoglutaric acid are 2.3 and 3.2 mM, respectively. The turnover number is 2.0 +/- 0.1 mumol min-1 mumol-1. L-Canaline (L-2-amino-4-(aminooxy)butyric acid) is a potent ornithine aminotransferase inhibitor. Reaction of the enzyme with L-[U-14C]canaline produces an enzyme-bound, covalently linked, radiolabeled canaline-pyridoxal phosphate oxime. The L-[U-14C]canaline-pyridoxal phosphate oxime has been isolated from canaline-treated enzyme. Dialysis of canaline-inactivated ornithine aminotransferase against free pyridoxal phosphate slowly reactivates the enzyme as the oxime is replaced by pyridoxal phosphate. Analysis of L-[U-14C]canaline binding to ornithine aminotransferase reveals the presence of 4 mol of pyridoxal phosphate/mol of enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1573496829,"6-Hydroxybenzofuran and phenylhydrazine are mechanism-based inhibitors of dopamine beta-hydroxylase (D beta H; EC 1.14.17.1). We report here the isolation and characterization of radiolabeled peptides obtained after inactivation of D beta H with [3H]6-hydroxybenzofuran and [14C]phenylhydrazine followed by digestion with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. Inactivation of D beta H with [3H]6-hydroxybenzofuran gave only one labeled peptide, whereas inactivation with [14C]phenylhydrazine gave several labeled peptides. Each inhibitor labeled a unique tyrosine in the enzyme corresponding to Tyr477 in the primary sequence of the bovine enzyme (Robertson, J. G., Desai, P. R., Kumar, A., Farrington, G. K., Fitzpatrick, P. F., and Villafranca, J. J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 1029-1035). In addition, [14C]phenylhydrazine also labeled a unique histidine (His249) as well as several other peptides. Examination of the complete peptide profile obtained by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis also revealed the presence of a modified but nonradioactive peptide. This peptide was isolated and sequenced and was identical whether the enzyme was inactivated by 6-hydroxybenzofuran or phenylhydrazine. An arginine at position 503 was missing from the sequence cycle performed by Edman degradation of the modified peptide, but arginine was present in the identical peptide isolated from native dopamine beta-hydroxylase. These data are analyzed based on an inactivation mechanism involving formation of enzyme bound radicals (Fitzpatrick, P. F., and Villafranca, J. J. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 4510-4518) interacting with active site amino acids that may have a role in substrate binding and binding of the copper ions at the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1568029710,"The nuclear fraction of rat hepatoma-derived HTC cells contained approximately 8% of the total cellular pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. HTC cells were able to metabolize [3H]pyridoxine to coenzymatically active pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate. As HTC cells did not have any demonstrable pyridoxine-5'-phosphate oxidase activity, the conversion of pyridoxine to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate must have taken place by a nonconventional route. The ratio of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate to pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate in the nonnuclear fraction of HTC cells was approximately 1:1, whereas in the nuclear fraction it was approximately 17:1, indicating that there was selective acquisition of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate by the nucleus. With the aid of a monoclonal antibody specific for the 5'-phosphopyridoxyl group, it was shown that there was one major pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-binding protein in a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)-resolved nucleoplasmic extract of HTC cells. This finding was confirmed by radioautography of an SDS-PAGE-resolved nucleoplasmic extract obtained from cells grown in a medium containing [3H]pyridoxine. Isoelectric focusing followed by SDS-PAGE also indicated the presence of one major pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-binding protein in the nucleoplasmic extract of HTC cells having a relatively high isoelectric point (approximately 7). Data were obtained indicating that the protein might exist in a higher molecular weight form, probably a dimer. Currently, these findings constitute virtually all of the available information on vitamin B6 and the cell nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1526711278,"The mitotic indices, villus heights, and crypt depths were determined in each of three jejunal regions (proximal, middle, and distal) for five animals each in the flight, vivarium, and synchronous groups. Because of the rapid turnover of intestinal mucosal cells and the delay in recovering the flight animals, it is not known whether the proliferation of jejunal mucosal cells is affected by microgravity conditions associated with spaceflight. However, since there were no consistent differences between animals in the flight group and those in the synchronous and vivarium control groups, it appears that any effects of microgravity on the turnover of jejunal mucosal cells are short-lived. Thus, this study represents an initial step in determining the effects of microgravity on the proliferation and turnover of intestinal mucosal cells.—Sawyer, H. R.; Moeller, C. L.; Phillips, R. W.; Smirnov, K. L. Effects of spaceflight on the proliferation of jejunal mucosal cells. FASEB J. 4: 92-94; 1990."
