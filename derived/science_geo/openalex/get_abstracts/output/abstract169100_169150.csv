https://openalex.org/W1938034723,"Salmonella enterica subspecies I, serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium), is a leading cause of human gastroenteritis, and is used as a mouse model of human typhoid fever. The incidence of non-typhoid salmonellosis is increasing worldwide, causing millions of infections and many deaths in the human population each year. Here we sequenced the 4,857-kilobase (kb) chromosome and 94-kb virulence plasmid of S. typhimurium strain LT2. The distribution of close homologues of S. typhimurium LT2 genes in eight related enterobacteria was determined using previously completed genomes of three related bacteria, sample sequencing of both S. enterica serovar Paratyphi A (S. paratyphi A) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and hybridization of three unsequenced genomes to a microarray of S. typhimurium LT2 genes. Lateral transfer of genes is frequent, with 11% of the S. typhimurium LT2 genes missing from S. enterica serovar Typhi (S. typhi), and 29% missing from Escherichia coli K12. The 352 gene homologues of S. typhimurium LT2 confined to subspecies I of S. enterica-containing most mammalian and bird pathogens-are useful for studies of epidemiology, host specificity and pathogenesis. Most of these homologues were previously unknown, and 50 may be exported to the periplasm or outer membrane, rendering them accessible as therapeutic or vaccine targets."
https://openalex.org/W2135146244,"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. typhi) is the aetiological agent of typhoid fever, a serious invasive bacterial disease of humans with an annual global burden of approximately 16 million cases, leading to 600,000 fatalities. Many S. enterica serovars actively invade the mucosal surface of the intestine but are normally contained in healthy individuals by the local immune defence mechanisms. However, S. typhi has evolved the ability to spread to the deeper tissues of humans, including liver, spleen and bone marrow. Here we have sequenced the 4,809,037-base pair (bp) genome of a S. typhi (CT18) that is resistant to multiple drugs, revealing the presence of hundreds of insertions and deletions compared with the Escherichia coli genome, ranging in size from single genes to large islands. Notably, the genome sequence identifies over two hundred pseudogenes, several corresponding to genes that are known to contribute to virulence in Salmonella typhimurium. This genetic degradation may contribute to the human-restricted host range for S. typhi. CT18 harbours a 218,150-bp multiple-drug-resistance incH1 plasmid (pHCM1), and a 106,516-bp cryptic plasmid (pHCM2), which shows recent common ancestry with a virulence plasmid of Yersinia pestis."

https://openalex.org/W3101464828,"When a metal undergoes a continuous quantum phase transition, non-Fermi liquid behaviour arises near the critical point. It is standard to assume that all low-energy degrees of freedom induced by quantum criticality are spatially extended, corresponding to long-wavelength fluctuations of the order parameter. However, this picture has been contradicted by recent experiments on a prototype system: heavy fermion metals at a zero-temperature magnetic transition. In particular, neutron scattering from CeCu$_{6-x}$Au$_x$ has revealed anomalous dynamics at atomic length scales, leading to much debate as to the fate of the local moments in the quantum-critical regime. Here we report our theoretical finding of a locally critical quantum phase transition in a model of heavy fermions. The dynamics at the critical point are in agreement with experiment. We also argue that local criticality is a phenomenon of general relevance to strongly correlated metals, including doped Mott insulators."

https://openalex.org/W1780908631,"Quantum mechanical experiments in ring geometries have long fascinated physicists. Open rings connected to leads, for example, allow the observation of the Aharonov-Bohm effect, one of the best examples of quantum mechanical phase coherence. The phase coherence of electrons travelling through a quantum dot embedded in one arm of an open ring has also been demonstrated. The energy spectra of closed rings have only recently been studied by optical spectroscopy. The prediction that they allow persistent current has been explored in various experiments. Here we report magnetotransport experiments on closed rings in the Coulomb blockade regime. Our experiments show that a microscopic understanding of energy levels, so far limited to few-electron quantum dots, can be extended to a many-electron system. A semiclassical interpretation of our results indicates that electron motion in the rings is governed by regular rather than chaotic motion, an unexplored regime in many-electron quantum dots. This opens a way to experiments where even more complex structures can be investigated at a quantum mechanical level."

Methionine sulfoxide reductase (MsrA) has been known for a long time, and its repairing function well characterized. Here we identify a new methionine sulfoxide reductase, which we referred to as MsrB, the gene of which is present in genomes of eubacteria, archaebacteria, and eucaryotes. ThemsrA and msrB genes exhibit no sequence similarity and, in some genomes, are fused. The Escherichia coli MsrB protein (currently predicted to be encoded by an open reading frame of unknown function named yeaA) was used for genetic, enzymatic, and mass spectrometric investigations. Our in vivo study revealed that msrB is required for cadmium resistance of E. coli, a carcinogenic compound that induces oxidative stress. Our in vitrostudies, showed that (i) MsrB and MsrA enzymes reduce free methionine sulfoxide with turn-over rates of 0.6 min−1 and 20 min−1, respectively, (ii) MsrA and MsrB act on oxidized calmodulin, each by repairing four to six of the eight methionine sulfoxide residues initially present, and (iii) simultaneous action of both MsrA and MsrB allowed full reduction of oxidized calmodulin.

Most macromolecules are targeted by AOS. There is an increasing body of evidence that links oxidative stress to reduced survival rate and various pathological situations (1Stadtman E.R. Science. 1992; 257: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (2374) Google Scholar). Therefore, a series of protecting systems helps cells to cope with the presence of AOS. A subset of these systems, including catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, acts by reducing endogenous levels of AOS. Another second subset includes enzymes to repair AOS damage; such “repairing” enzymes can rescue oxidized lipid, DNA, or proteins. Protein oxidation can lead to conformation changes and, in some cases, loss of function. Amino acids readily prone to AOS oxidation include cysteine, histidine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and methionine, this latter being the most sensitive (2Vogt W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Methionine oxidation to methionine sulfoxide (MetSO) is reversible. Reduction of MetSO is catalyzed by methionine sulfoxide reductase (MsrA), an enzyme present in all living organisms (3Brot N. Weissbach L. Werth J. Weissbach H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

MsrA has been known for a long time and has received increasing attention over the last years. Its three-dimensional structure has been described (5Lowther W.T. Brot N. Weissbach H. Matthews B.W.

MsrA has been found to reduce both free MetSO as well as MetSO residues in proteins. A series of proteins, of considerable medical interest, has been identified as substrates of MsrA. These include calmodulin (9Sun H. Gao J. Ferrington D.A. Biesiada H. Williams T. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), HIV protease (10Davis D.A.

Lovell M.A. Markesbery W.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1660-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) while MsrA deficiency had previously been linked to smoker's emphysema (11Abrams W.R.

In prokaryotes, mutation in msrA renders the cells sensitive to hydrogen peroxide treatment (13Moskovitz J. Rahman M.A. Strassman J. Yancey S.O. Kushner S.R. Brot N. Weissbach H. J.

A. 1999; 96: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Conversely, in yeast, overproduction of MsrA leads to resistance to AOS (15Moskovitz J. Flescher E. Berlett B.S. Azare J. Poston J.M. Stadman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14071-14075Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Furthermore,msrA mutations decrease the virulence of many human and plant pathogens (14El Hassouni M. Chambost J.P. Expert D. Van Gijsegem F. Barras F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In a few bacteria, MsrA is actually a domain of a polypeptide containing a second domain. We have analyzed the occurrence of this second domain and found it coded for in most sequenced genomes. InEscherichia coli, this gene is named yeaA. Here we report the characterization of YeaA, that we have rebaptised MsrB and find it to be a second methionine sulfoxide reductase that acts both on free MetSO and protein-contained MetSO residues. Unless noted otherwise, chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Thioredoxin reductase was a gift from Dr. C. Williams (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Bacteria were grown on Luria-Bertani medium or M9 minimal medium. DNA manipulations were carried out using standard techniques, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid pET21MsrA was obtained by cloning the msrA gene in the pET21a vector (Novagen). Expression from this vector results in the synthesis of a protein with a His tag on the C terminus. ThemsrA coding region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using chromosomal DNA from E. coli strain MG1655 as a template and the oligonucleotides pFMsrAColi2-(GAATTCGCTAGCGAGCTCAGGAGGTTCCATATGAGTTTATTTGATAAAAAGCATCTGG) and pMsrAHis-C (GATCACTAAGCTTGGATCCTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGTGCTTCCGGC GGCAGACAGAC) as primers. The PCR product was inserted in plasmid pET21a between the EcoRI and HindIII sites. Plasmid pBAD24MsrB was obtained by cloning the msrB coding region into pBAD24 plasmid. The msrB coding region was amplified by PCR, using chromosomal DNA from E. coli strain MG1655 as a template and oligonucleotides pFMsrB1(CTGATAGAATTCCATATGGCTAATAAACCTTCGGC) and pBMsrB3 (TACTATTCTAAGCTTGGATCCTCAACCGTTGATTTCTTCGCCG) as primers. The PCR product was inserted in pBAD24 plasmid between the EcoRI andHindIII sites. All plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The C-terminal His-tagged form of MsrA was purified. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) cells containing the plasmids pET21MsrA plasmid grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were grown until an A600 value of 0.6, then 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and growth was continued for another 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and the pellet stored at −80 °C. The thawed pellet (2 g) was resuspended in 8 ml of buffer M (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 0.3 m KCl. Resuspended cells were broken by a single pass through a chilled French pressure cell at 6 tons. The resulting crude extract was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded on a 5-ml Hi-trap column (Amersham Biosciences) charged with nickel and equilibrated with buffer M plus 0.1 m KCl. Proteins were eluted by a 13-ml gradient from 0.05 to 0.5 mimidazole, and the fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The MsrA-containing fractions were pooled, brought to 0.1 m KCl, and loaded on a 0.5 × 5cm MonoQ column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer M plus 0.1m KCl and 5 mm dithiothreitol. MsrA was eluted with a 7-ml gradient from 0.1 to 0.5 m KCl. Several fractions containing MsrA that were >98% pure as estimated by SDS-PAGE were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Typical yields were 20 mg per liter of culture. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method using the Bio-Rad Protein assay kit. MsrB protein was overproduced in DH5α cells containing the plasmid pBAD24MsrB. Cells were grown at 37 °C until anA600 value of 0.6 in 4 liters of Luria Bertani broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Expression was induced by adding 0.2% arabinose and growth was continued for another 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet (12 g) was resuspended in 48 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol). Resuspended cells were broken by a single pass through an ice-chilled French pressure cell at 5.5 tons. The crude extract was centrifuged at 30,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was precipitated with 0.1% (v/v) polyethylenimine and centrifuged at 15,000 ×g at 4 °C for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was adjusted to 50 mm KCl and applied on a 30-ml Q-Sepharose (Sigma) column (column XK 16/20 Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A plus 0.05 m KCl. A 150-ml gradient, running from 0.05 to 0.5 m KCl, was used for elution. Fractions containing MsrB were detected by immunoblot using anti-MsrB antibodies. The MsrB-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration on ultrafree biomax-5K (Millipore). Concentrated proteins were run on a gel filtration column (Superdex 75 HR 10/30 Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer M supplemented with 50 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol. MsrB protein was eluted at a molecular mass of 15,000 Da. Purity was estimated to be greater than 98% on SDS-PAGE Coomassie Blue staining. Mass spectrometry on the sample confirmed that MsrB was pure. Calibration of the gel filtration column indicated that the size of MsrB was 15,000 Da as predicted from amino acid sequence. Typical yields were 6 mg per liter of culture. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using the Bio-Rad Protein assay kit. Calmodulin VU1, a recombinant calmodulin able to activate all calmodulin targets was used (17Craig T.A. Waterson D.M. Prendergast F.G. Haiech J. Roberts D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3278-3284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). VU1 was expressed and purified by column chromatography as previously described (18Roberts D.M. Crea R. Malecha M. Alvarado-Urbina G. Chiarello R.H. Waterson D.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5090-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Purity of the protein was checked by SDS-PAGE and electrospray mass spectrometry. Prior to oxidation, calmodulin was decalcified. One to 10 mg of lyophilized CaM was dissolved in water and precipitated with 3.3% trichloroacetic acid. The pellet was suspended in a minimal volume of Tris 1m, pH9, water added to 1 ml of trichloroacetic acid precipitation was repeated three times, and, the last time, calmodulin-containing pellet was suspended in Hepes 50 mm,pH 7.5. Decalcified calmodulin (100 μm in Hepes 50 mm, pH 7.5) was treated with 50 mmH2O2 for 4 h at room temperature. H2O2 was removed by gel filtration through G25 Sephadex. Calmodulin was then concentrated by ultrafiltration on ultrafree biomax-5K (Millipore). Methionine sulfoxide reductase activity was assayed in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing the substrate CaMox or MetSO, thioredoxin (5 μm), thioredoxin reductase (87 nm), and NADPH (that was used either at 200 or 400 μm). Reducing equivalents required for MetSO reduction were given by NADPH through the thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase system (19Moskovitz J. Weissbach H. Brot N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2095-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out at 37 °C in a final volume of 400 μl. All of the components were mixed together before adding the enzyme. The amount of NADPH oxidized was determined by measuring the absorbance at 340 nm. A unit of activity was defined as 1 nmol of NADPH oxidized per min. The rate of NADPH oxidation was linear with respect to enzyme concentration. Sample preparation was performed as follows. 30 μm CaMox was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 1 μm of MsrA, MsrB, or both in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing thioredoxin (5 μm), thioredoxin reductase (87 nm) and NADPH (400 μm). The reaction was stopped by loading the sample onto a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with NH 4+ acetate (pH 6.2). The eluted protein was subsequently lyophilized. Mass spectrometry measurements were made using a Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometer (Bruker Daltronics, Billerica, MA) equipped with a shielded 9.4T super-conducting magnet (Magnex Scientific Ltd, Abingdon, Oxon, United Kingdom) a cylindrical “infinity” ion cyclotron resonance cell with a diameter of 0.06 m and an external electrospray source (Analytica of Branford, Branford, CT) (20Palmblad M.H.K. Hakansson P. Feng X. Cooper H.J. Giannakopulos A.E. Green P.S. Derrick P.J. Eur. J. Mass. Spectrom. 2000; 6: 267-275Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Carbon dioxide heated to 200 °C was used as the drying gas in the electrospray source. The background pressure in the ion cyclotron resonance cell was typically below 2 × 10−10millibars. Calmodulin samples were prepared at a concentration of 30 μm in 50:50 water:acetonitrile 1% formic acid and injected into the mass spectrometer using a syringe pump, at a rate of 60 μl h−1. Plasmid pMsrB was obtained as follows. The msrB coding region was amplified from chromosomal DNA from E. coli strain MG1655 using oligonucleotides 5′ coding pFMsrB2 containing anEcoRI site (5′-ACTGATCATGAATTCCAAGCTTTGTTAGTGAATAAAAGGTTG-3′) and 3′-complementary pBMsrB3 containing a SphI site (5′-TAGCTCAGCATGCAACTCAGATCACAATTACGC-3′). Note that pFMsrB2 and pBMsrB3 oligonucleotides are found at 300 nt upstream and 560 nt downstream of the msrB coding region. The resulting PCR product was cloned into pUC18 plasmid, previously cut withEcoRI and SphI enzymes, yielding pMsrB01. ThemsrB gene was interrupted by insertion of anaphA-3 cassette (KanR) (21Menard R. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5899-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) to generate a non-polar mutation as follows. The pMsrB01 plasmid was digested withAgeI, and the extremities blunted with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The aphA-3 cassette was obtained afterSmaI digestion of pUC18K plasmid and inserted at theAgeI linearized pMsrB01 plasmid, yielding pMsrB02 plasmid. Note that the AgeI site is located at nt 210 downstream the ATG start codon. The pMsrB02 plasmid was then linearized by usingSphI and EcoRI restriction enzymes and the resulting linear fragment was electroporated into E. coliKM354 (recJ) strain carrying the pTP223 plasmid (bet gam exo) (22Murphy K.C. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2063-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). KanR clones were selected and checked for AmpS phenotype. PCR was then used to check that recombination had taken place at the msrB locus. Last, the mutation was transferred into the E. coli MG1655 wild type strain by transduction with P1 phage, and the resulting mutant strain was called BE017. Cultures of E. coli were grown overnight in M9 medium. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in fresh M9 to an A600 of 0.01. Growth was followed by measuring the A600. During the exponential growth phase (A600 of 0.6), cultures were split into two subcultures, one of which received cadmium (final concentration 22 μm). In six of the available genome sequences, msrA-encoded protein is fused to an additional domain of ∼150 residues in size and of unknown function. This additional domain was found to occur in all available genomic sequences, including eubacteria, animals, plants, humans, and some archea, most often as a single gene product. This domain will be referred to as MsrB. The level of conservation within the MsrB family is quite high since, for instance, human and E. colisequences share around 25% identity. The fusion between MsrA and MsrB in some genomes was recently used as a basis to predict physical interactions between the two proteins (23Enright A.J. Iliopoulos I. Kyrpides N.C. Ouzounis C.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). We investigated this issue by using E. coli MsrB and MsrA proteins as models. Both proteins were purified (see “Experimental Procedures”) mixed, and run on a gel filtration column. Despite use of various running conditions, MsrA and MsrB always eluted at their respective apparent molecular weight (data not shown). Likewise, interaction between MsrA and MsrB failed to be revealed by either cross-linking or yeast two-hybrid assays (data not shown). Taken together, these data rendered a physical interaction between MsrA and MsrB highly unlikely. Another possibility to account for the fusion of MsrA and MsrB was that they are functionally related. Therefore, we tested whether MsrB had sulfoxide reductase activity. MetSO and dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) were used as substrates as well as methionine. The thioredoxin recycling assay, where reducing equivalents are provided by NADPH through the thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase system, was used (19Moskovitz J. Weissbach H. Brot N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2095-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Reductase activity was determined by following spectrophotometrically the oxidation of NADPH. NADPH oxidation was observed when MetSO (2.8 nmol NADPH oxidized/min) or Me2SO (5.7 nmol NADPH oxidized/min) were used as substrates. In contrast, no NADPH oxidation was observed with methionine as a substrate. This indicated that MsrB has a sulfoxide reductase activity. To compare the efficiencies of MsrA and MsrB in reducing free MetSO, we undertook steady-state kinetics analysis of these enzymes. Under our assay conditions, MsrB and MsrA exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig.1). Km values were 170 μm and 6.7 mm for MsrA and MsrB, respectively. The value found with MsrA is in good agreement with the previously published value of 120 μm (24Moskovitz J. Poston J.M. Berlett B.S. Nosworthy N.J. Szczepanowski R. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14167-14172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Turn over numbers were 20 min−1 and 0.6 min−1 for MsrA and MsrB, respectively. Catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of MsrA was found to be 1000-fold greater than that of MsrB reflecting the much lower ability of MsrB to reduce free MetSO. These results indicated that MsrB is much less efficient at reducing free MetSO than MsrA. To know whether MsrB could act on peptide-bound MetSO, CaMox was used as a substrate since repair of CaMox by MsrA has been well documented (9Sun H. Gao J. Ferrington D.A. Biesiada H. Williams T. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies showed that activities of MsrA and MsrB, using CaMox as a substrate, were similar (Fig.2). MsrA exhibited higher initial rate of NADPH oxidation, e.g. 2 nmol of NADPH oxidized/min, than MsrB, e.g. 1.3 nmol of NADPH oxidized/min (Fig. 2). However, the total amount of NADPH oxidized by either MsrA or MsrB was identical. This analysis showed that MsrB can also act on MetSO residues within oxidized proteins. The repair of CaMox by MsrB was further studied by mass spectrometry. Calmodulin was first decalcified and subsequently oxidized in vitro, and the resulting product analyzed by mass electrospray coupled to Fourier Transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) (Fig.3A). The major species (45%) was CaMox containing 8 MetSO (there are eight methionines in the CaM used). Additional abundant species containing 6 and 7 MetSO were also detected, amounting to 24 and 31%, respectively. No other species were detected indicating that only MetSO were generated. Incubation of CaMox with MsrA resulted in reduction of several, but not all of the MetSO residues (Fig. 3B) The most abundant population contained 3 MetSO (41%) though oxiforms containing 1 to 4 MetSO residues were present (Fig. 3B). Such a partial repair of CaMox by MsrA is consistent with previous work by others (9Sun H. Gao J. Ferrington D.A. Biesiada H. Williams T. Squier T.C.

Oxiforms containing from 1 to 4 MetSO were found, with the 3 MetSO-containing species being the most abundant (40%). It is noteworthy that the 1 MetSO-containing oxiform population accounted for 12% of the population repaired by MsrB while it was in very low abundance (4%) when MsrA was used as a reductase. Incubation of CaMox with both MsrA and MsrB yielded three populations. The first exhibited a mass that corresponded to the expected value for fully reduced CaM. This species accounted for 60% of the population. A second species, the mass of which corresponded to reduced CaM with one calcium ion bound, represented about 32% of the population. We could also observe a very low abundance species, the mass of which corresponded to that expected for a reduced calmodulin with two calcium ions bound (6%). It is likely that calcium found in these species came from trace amounts present in instruments or the preparations of MsrA, MsrB, or thioredoxin reductase. The fact that full repair of CaMox required the presence of both MsrA and MsrB suggested that the two enzymes possess complementary properties. To investigate this issue, we submitted CaMox to sequential repair by MsrA and MsrB. CaMox was incubated with MsrB in the presence of both NADPH and the couple thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase, and the reaction left to proceed until NADPH oxidation stopped (Fig.4A). Arrest of the reaction could be due to limitation of either a chemical required for the reaction or substrate. Subsequent addition in the same mixture of a new batch of CaMox allowed the reaction to resume (Fig. 4A). In contrast, addition of new enzyme did not allow the reaction to resume (Fig. 4A). Taken together, these experiments indicate that the reaction had previously ceased because of substrate limitation. In a new experiment, we left the MsrB-catalyzed reaction to proceed until it reached substrate limitation and then added MsrA. We observed that NADPH oxidation resumed (Fig. 4A). The converse experiment was also performed. CaMox was first reduced by MsrA, the reaction again left to proceed until apparent completion, i.e. substrate limitation, and MsrB was subsequently added to the mixture. Again, we observed that the consumption of NADPH resumed upon addition of the second enzyme (Fig. 4B). MsrB Contributes to Resistance of E. coli Against Cadmium—A strain of E. coli lacking a functional copy ofmsrB was constructed by reverse genetics (see “Experimental Procedures”). No defect in growth rate or colony morphology was observed when grown in LB medium. The expression of an ortholog of msrB has been reported to be induced by cadmium in Enterococcus faecalis (25Laplace J.M. Hartke A. Giard J.C. Auffray Y. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 53: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether msrB had any relationship with cadmium resistance inE. coli. While wild type E. coli MG1655 strain grew well in the presence of cadmium, MG1655 msrB strain stopped growing (Fig. 5). We should note that in some experiments, cadmium sensitivity was less dramatic. We have no explanation for this but suspect changes in trace elements concentration in the growth medium. In any case, throughout over 10 experiments carried out with simultaneously growing pair of isogenic wild type and mutant, this later always exhibited increased sensitivity to cadmium. In this study, we identified a new methionine sulfoxide reductase, the structural gene of which is conserved throughout almost all free-living organisms with the exception of a few archaebacteria. The function of this enzyme is to repair proteins that have been damaged by exposure to oxidative agents. MsrB was found to act on free MetSO and Me2SO. This argues for MsrB being specific for the −SO functional group. MsrB was also very efficient in reducing MetSO residues in peptides. To demonstrate this, we used calmodulin as a model substrate, since this later had been extensively used for probing the reductase activity of MsrA (for reviews see Refs. 4Brot N. Weissbach H. Biopolymers. 2001; 55: 288-296Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 26Squier T.C. Bigelow D.J. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: 504-526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of MsrA and MsrB activities on CaMox suggested that they reduced CaMox with similar efficiencies. Electrospray mass spectrometry coupled to FTICR was then used to characterize the products of MsrA and/or MsrB acting on CaMox. It should be remarked that the analysis of such protein mixtures is quite complex since species with similar molecular masses can overlap (there is only a 6-Da differences between a double oxidation and a one Ca2+ adduct), generating poorly resolved peaks and inaccuracies in mass assignment. The high accuracy (less than 10 ppm) and resolution of FTICR measurements allowed us to characterize oxiforms of calmodulin recovered after treatment with either reductase. A first set of experiments, in which MsrA and MsrB were added separately to CaMox, revealed a similar pattern of products. Neither one was able to fully reduce CaMox, and, in both cases, the most populated oxiform contained 3 MetSO out of 8 initially present. Repair of CaMox by MsrA was extensively studied by Squier and collaborators (9Sun H. Gao J. Ferrington D.A. Biesiada H. Williams T. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 26Squier T.C. Bigelow D.J. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: 504-526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overall our results are consistent with those reported by these authors although some differences appeared in the population size of each oxiform. These apparent discrepancies could be accounted for by differences in samples preparation or the origin of the calmodulin used. In particular, these authors used calcium-loaded CaMox while we used decalcified calmodulin. Analysis of the effect of calcium on oxidation and subsequent MsrA/B-mediated repair is under way using calorimetric methods. Full repair of CaMox is an as yet undocumented phenomenon. This was achieved when MsrA and MsrB were added simultaneously. To explain that MsrA was unable to fully repair CaMox, Squier and collaborators put forward the hypothesis that MsrA repairs MetSO residues that are located in hydrophobic regions of CaMox, i.e. those residues that are buried in the native structure. This led support to the model that MsrA acts upon unfolded forms (9Sun H. Gao J. Ferrington D.A. Biesiada H. Williams T. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). As a consequence, we might explain the full repair of CaMox by postulating that MsrB acts upon solvent-exposed MetSO. However, recent results revealed that MsrA exhibits diastereoselectivity and acts selectively onl-Met-S-SO in CaMox (27Sharov V.S. Ferrington D.A. Squier T.C. Schöneich C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 28Sharov V.S. Schöneich C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Hence, another possibility is that MsrB repairs selectively l-Met-R-SO. CaMox would then contain a mixture of both diastereoisomers that would require both types of methionine sulfoxide reductase to be fully reduced. The hypothesis of substrate specificity received additional experimental support by submitting CaMox to sequential action of MsrA and MsrB. Indeed, we observed that CaMox that had previously been reduced by MsrA remained a bona fide substrate for MsrB and vice versa. The simplest interpretation is that each Msr targets different MetSO diastereoisomers within CaMox. Recently, this hypothesis received additional support using purified l-Met-R-SO andl-Met-S-SO and MsrB-purified protein. 2H. Weissbach, personal communication. Despite being functionally related, MsrA and MsrB appear not to share a recent origin since comparison of their amino acid sequences failed to reveal any overall similarity. Moreover, 1D NMR analysis ofE. coli MsrB 3P. Gans, unpublished material. as well as CD spectra of the Mycoplasma genitalium msrBortholog (MG448) suggested that MsrB is unstructured (29Balasubramanian S. Schneider T. Gerstein M. Regan L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3075-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This contrasts with MsrA that is well structured, as recently shown by the resolution of the three-dimensional structures by x-ray crystallography (5Lowther W.T. Brot N. Weissbach H. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13307-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 6Tete-Favier F. Cobessi D. Boschi-Muller S. Azza S. Branlant G. Aubry A. Structure. 2000; 8: 1167-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Of potential interest, however, is a motif reading CGWP(S/A)F that is present in MsrB sequences. This motif is reminiscent of the signature motif CGFWG, containing the Cys catalytic residue in MsrA (7Lowther W.T. Brot N. Weissbach H. Honek J.F. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6463-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Ongoing studies aim at testing the role of the CGWP(S/A)F motif in MsrB activity. Analysis of msrA and msrB genes distribution in all sequenced genomes revealed a great diversity of genetic organizations (Fig. 6). In some genomes,msrA and msrB are located in different positions (e.g. E. coli). In some genomes, they are fused such as to encode a bifunctional MsrA-MsrB polypeptide (e.g. Helicobacter pylori). In Bacillus subtilis, the intermediate situation is to be found since msrA andmsrB genes lie adjacent one to the other, most probably in an operon structure. In Neisseria, they are fused with thedsbE ortholog that encodes a disulfide oxidoreductase. Intriguingly, in this later case, the three-domain protein possess a signal sequence, suggesting that it acts in an extracytoplasmic compartment. Another type of organization is found in Arabidopsis thaliana, in which there are multiple msrA andmsrB, with one gene predicted to encode a polypeptide containing two MsrB domains in tandem. Another remarkable case is provided by human where MsrB was called SelX, a selenocysteine-containing protein (30Lescure A. Gautheret D. Carbon P. Krol A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38147-38154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Characterization of these diverse MsrB orthologs will be of interest in revealing the biological importance of these diverse genetic arrangements. It would, for instance, be of interest to know whether increased efficiency in repair was gained by the fusion of msrA and msrB or by the tandem duplication of msrB as found in plants. Phenotypic analysis of an E. coli strain lacking a functional copy of msrB revealed its importance in cadmium resistance. Cadmium is a potent carcinogenic and damages cells in several ways, among which is catalysis of AOS production. Hypersensitivity of E. coli msrB to cadmium is consistent with the finding that expression of the E. faecalis msrBortholog (and not msrA as misquoted by the authors) is induced in the presence of cadmium (25Laplace J.M. Hartke A. Giard J.C. Auffray Y. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 53: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this context, it is important to remember that msrA mutation confers increased sensitivity to oxidative stress in both E. coli andErwinia chrysanthemi (13Moskovitz J. Rahman M.A. Strassman J. Yancey S.O. Kushner S.R. Brot N. Weissbach H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 14El Hassouni M. Chambost J.P. Expert D. Van Gijsegem F. Barras F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These phenotypic analyses together with the biochemical features of MsrA and MsrB suggest that these methionine sulfoxide reductases have an important function in protecting cells from oxidative damages. Furthermore, a crucial role for msrB in cell physiology was recently advanced by a systematic alteration of Mycobacterium open reading frame that identified the msrB ortholog as an essential gene (31Hutchison C.A. Peterson S.N. Gill S.R. Cline R.T. White O. Fraser C.M. Smith H.O. Venter J.C. Science. 1999; 286: 2165-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Although most proteins contain solvent-exposed methionine that are potential targets for oxidation, one can expect that only a subset of cell proteins will be fully inactivated by methionine oxidation. Hence, importance of the Msr repair pathway might be appreciated by identifying those proteins that contain structural and/or functionally important Met residues. Alternatively, insight might be provided by proteomic approaches aimed at describing proteins networks. A systematic search for protein/protein interactions by the yeast two-hybrid screen was recently carried out in H. pylori(32Rain J.C. Selig L. De Reuse H. Battaglia V. Reverdy C. Simon S. Lenzen G. Petel F. Wojcik J. Schachter V. Chemama Y. Labigne A. Legrain P. Nature. 2001; 409: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the H. pylori bi-functional MsrA/MsrB protein (Fig. 6) was found to interact with ClpX, a chaperone that assists folding of abnormal proteins or associates with the ClpP protease for degradation of those misfolded proteins. Hence, a possibility is that MsrA/B repairs oxidized ClpX. Alternatively, MsrA/B and ClpX might form a complex such that a given oxidized protein might either get repaired by MsrA/B or be directed to ClpP-mediated degradation. Our ongoing studies aim at identifying in vivosubstrates of MsrA and MsrB to define the repair pathway of MetSO-containing proteins. We are grateful to C.

The two most commonly measured AGEs, Nε-(carboxymethyl)lysine and pentosidine, are glycoxidation products, formed from glucose by sequential glycation and autoxidation reactions. Although several compounds have been developed as AGE inhibitors and are being tested in animal models of diabetes and in clinical trials, the mechanism of action of these inhibitors is poorly understood. In general, they are thought to function as nucleophilic traps for reactive carbonyl intermediates in the formation of AGEs; however alternative mechanisms of actions, such as chelation, have not been rigorously examined. To distinguish between the carbonyl trapping and antioxidant activity of AGE inhibitors, we have measured the chelating activity of the inhibitors by determining the concentration required for 50% inhibition of the rate of copper-catalyzed autoxidation of ascorbic acid in phosphate buffer. All AGE inhibitors studied were chelators of copper, as measured by inhibition of metal-catalyzed autoxidation of ascorbate. Apparent binding constants for copper ranged from ∼2 mm for aminoguanidine and pyridoxamine, to 10–100 μm for carnosine, phenazinediamine, OPB-9195 and tenilsetam. The AGE-breakers, phenacylthiazolium and phenacyldimethylthiazolium bromide, and their hydrolysis products, were among the most potent inhibitors of ascorbate oxidation. We conclude that, at millimolar concentrations of AGE inhibitors used in many in vitro studies, inhibition of AGE formation results primarily from the chelating or antioxidant activity of the AGE inhibitors, rather than their carbonyl trapping activity. Further, at therapeutic concentrations, the chelating activity of AGE inhibitors and AGE-breakers may contribute to their inhibition of AGE formation and protection against development of diabetic complications.

These products contribute to the age-dependent chemical modification of long lived tissue proteins (2Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W.

The two most commonly measured AGEs, Nε-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) and pentosidine, are glycoxidation products formed by sequential glycation and oxidation reactions (7Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar), and traces of transition metal ions in physiological buffers are potent catalysts of the formation of these AGEs in vitro (8Chace K.V. Carubelli R. Nordquist R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). AGE inhibitors are nucleophilic compounds designed to trap reactive carbonyl or dicarbonyl intermediates in AGE formation. However, as shown here, some of these compounds also have potent chelating activity, making it difficult to dissect the antioxidative, chelating activity from the carbonyl trapping activity of the inhibitors in in vitro studies. In the present work, we measured the chelating activity of AGE inhibitors by determining the concentration required for 50% inhibition of copper-catalyzed autoxidation of ascorbic acid in phosphate buffer. Using this assay, we show that AGE inhibitors have weak-to-potent metal chelating activity, and that, in fact, many experiments demonstrating the activity of AGE inhibitors in vitro are likely to be measuring the chelating activity rather than carbonyl trapping activity of these compounds. We also show that AGE-breakers and their hydrolysis products are potent chelators of copper and conclude that both the carbonyl trapping and chelation activity of AGE inhibitors and AGE-breakers may be involved in their therapeutic mechanism of action.

(15Soulis T. Sastra S. Thallas V. Mortensen S.B. Wilken M. Clausen J.T. Bjerrum O.J. Petersen H. Lau J. Jerums G. Boel E. Cooper M.E. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 472-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). PTB, PMTB, and DAP were homogeneous by reverse phase-HPLC analysis and by electrospray ionization liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. All water used in these experiments was distilled and then deionized (15–18 MΩ) using a mixed bed ion-exchanger with activated charcoal polisher. Chelex-100 (∼80% water content) was suspended and allowed to settle several times in water to remove soluble chelator and fine particles (16Van Reyk D.M. Brown A.J. Jessup W. Dean R.T. Free Radic. Res. 1995; 23: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To remove metal ions from phosphate buffer, chelex-100 resin (7 g/liter, wet weight) was added to 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in a 2-liter plastic container and rocked gently overnight at room temperature. The buffer was stored at room temperature in the same container, allowing the resin to settle to the bottom; aliquots were removed for experiments, as needed. All incubations (1.5-ml total volume) were conducted in chelex-treated 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in a water bath at 30 °C; reagents were pre-equilibrated at this temperature for at least 5 min. In preliminary experiments, the kinetics of oxidation of AA was determined in quartz spectrophotometer cuvettes by measuring the rate of decrease in absorbance at 265 nm, as described by Buettner (17Buettner G.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); the cuvettes were precleaned by soaking overnight in 1% nitric acid. AA (500 μm) was stable (>99% recovery) in chelex-treated 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for at least 1 h. Addition of 500 nm CuCl2 yielded a half-life of approximately 1 h. For studies with AGE inhibitors, the copper and inhibitor were preincubated in phosphate buffer for 5 min, and then the ascorbate was added from a concentrated solution (75 μl of 10 mm AA in water) to initiate the reaction. Aliquots (150 μl) were removed at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min and transferred to autoinjector vials containing 15 μl of 10 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) to quench the metal-catalyzed oxidation reaction. Samples were analyzed by RP-HPLC, using a Supelcosil LC-18 column (25 cm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) (Supelco; Bellefonte, PA) on a Shimadzu (Columbia, MD) LC-10Ai liquid chromatograph equipped with a SIL-10Ai auto-injector and an SPD-10AV UV-Vis detector. Solvents for HPLC were: A, 0.1% HFBA in water and B, 50% acetonitrile. The gradient was 100% A at 0 min, increase to 80% B from 0 to 4 min, return to 100% A from 4 to 4.1 min, then re-equilibrate in 100% A from 4.1 to 9 min. The absorbance of ascorbic acid was measured at 244 nm (Fig. 1), and the peak area was integrated to estimate the percent of AA remaining versustime. The equations for the least-squares fits to these plots (triplicate analyses) were determined with SigmaPlot 2000 (Jandel Scientific) and used to determine the concentration of each compound that inhibited the rate of AA oxidation by 50% (IC50). All assays with AGE inhibitors were performed in triplicate by HPLC, measuring residual ascorbate by absorbance at 244 nm (Fig.1). None of the compounds tested co-eluted with or otherwise interfered with the measurement of ascorbate by this RP-HPLC method. In preliminary studies, we adjusted experimental conditions to obtain a concentration of cupric ion that would catalyze the oxidation of AA (500 μm) with an approximate half-life of 1 h. As shown in Fig.2 (lower lines; without AG or PM), this was achieved by addition of 500 nmCuCl2 to 50 mm chelex-treated phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 30 °C. This half-life was comparable with the half-life of ascorbate in 0.1 m phosphate buffers prepared in our laboratory; however, buffers prepared with different batches of phosphate salts varied in their catalytic activity because of batch-to-batch variation in metal ion content. The AGE inhibitors, AG and PM, inhibited the oxidation of AA in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2). The linearity of the semilogarithmic plots illustrates that the AGE inhibitors did not alter the pseudo-first order kinetics of the autoxidation reaction. Graphical analysis of the rate of ascorbate oxidation versusinhibitor concentration indicated that percent inhibition was not a linear function of inhibitor concentration. The linear relationships between percent inhibition and the square of the inhibitor concentration, shown in Fig. 3, were consistent with formation of 2:1 or higher valency complexes between AG or PM and Cu(II) ions. These data yielded IC50 values of ∼2.5 mm for AG and ∼1 mm for PM. Amine nitrogens are common ligands for transition metal ions and pyridoxine (IC50 ∼3.6 mm) and pyridoxal (IC50 ≫ 5 mm), with a hydroxymethyl or carboxaldehyde group, in lieu of the aminomethyl group of PM, were less inhibitory than PM itself (Fig. 3). Carnosine and its the constituent amino acid histidine were potent inhibitors of AA oxidation, with IC50 values ∼4 and 12 μm, respectively (Fig.4A). The antioxidative effect of carnosine and histidine was an asymptotic function of increasing inhibitor concentration, suggesting that the chelate species may have some residual catalytic activity. Among other compounds tested, taurine and ethanol had no effect on metal-catalyzed oxidation of AA. As shown in Fig. 4B, the AGE inhibitors, DAP and tenilsetam, had IC50 values of ∼50 and 25 μm, respectively, whereas OPB-9195 (Fig. 4C) yielded a consistently non-linear response with a minimum at ∼5 μm. Both of the AGE-breakers, PTB and PMTB, were also potent inhibitors of ascorbate oxidation, with IC50 values of ∼10 and 80 μm, respectively (Fig. 5). Because the half-life of PTB and PMTB were 2 and 8 h, respectively, in phosphate buffer at 30 °C, 2S. R. Thorpe, J. E. Litchfield, S.-Z. Yang, and J. W. Baynes, manuscript in preparation. we also measured the activity of the hydrolysis products in the ascorbate oxidation system. For these experiments, the AGE-breakers were incubated for 24 h in buffer prior to addition of the ascorbate. As also shown in Fig. 5, the hydrolysis products had IC50 values of <2 μm and were among the most potent inhibitors of metal-catalyzed oxidation of ascorbate. The non-linear response obtained with native PTB (Fig. 5A) suggests that ongoing hydrolysis, ∼30% during the course of the 1-h incubation, may have contributed to the increased inhibitory activity of this compound at higher concentrations. To assess the potential role of AGE inhibitors and AGE-breakers as inhibitors of metal-catalyzed oxidation chemistry in vivo, we also measured the effects of plasma albumin on the kinetics of ascorbate oxidation. As shown in Fig. 6, among all the compounds tested, bovine serum albumin was the most potent inhibitor of ascorbate oxidation on a molar basis. The IC50 for bovine serum albumin, ∼80 nm (∼5 μg/ml), was 16% of the concentration of Cu(II) in the reaction system, suggesting at least 6 binding sites for copper. The late Simon Wolff was a pioneer in focusing attention on the metal chelating activity of drugs designed for other activities (18Woollard A.C. Wolff S.P. Bascal Z.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1990; 9: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Jiang Z.Y. Zhou Q.L. Eaton J.W. Koppenol W.H. Hunt J.V. Wolff S.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1273-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Aldose reductase inhibitors and anti-inflammatory agents with anticataract activity were shown to have substantial chelating activity, suggesting that their chelating activity might protect lens proteins from chemical damage by inhibiting metal-catalyzed autoxidation of sugars or ascorbate (20Wolff S.P. Jiang Z.Y. Hunt J.V. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 10: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar,21Thornalley P. Wolff S. Crabbe J. Stern A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 797: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In the present study we have evaluated the chelating activity of various AGE inhibitors to determine the role of metal chelation in the mechanism of action of AGE inhibitors. A typical reaction pathway for the formation of AGEs from AA (and other carbohydrates) in vitro is shown in Fig. 7. Metal-catalyzed autoxidation chemistry accelerates the browning and cross-linking of protein by carbohydrates and is essential for the formation of the glycoxidation products, CML and pentosidine. Chelators such as DTPA are potent inhibitors of formation of these AGEs from ascorbate (22Dunn J.A. Ahmed M.U. Murtiashaw M.H. Richardson J.M. Walla M.D. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10964-10970Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and glucose (23Fu M.X. Wells-Knecht K.J. Blackledge J.A. Lyons T.J. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 676-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 7, dotted arrows). In contrast, AGE inhibitors, such as AG and PM, are thought to function as carbonyl traps (3Nilsson B.O. Inflamm. Res. 1999; 48: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 4Khalifah R.G. Baynes J.W. Hudson B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), reacting with electrophilic, carbonyl intermediates formed on autoxidation of carbohydrates, thereby protecting against chemical modification of nucleophilic residues on protein (Fig. 7, solid arrow). Our experiments show, however, that AGE inhibitors are also transition metal chelators and inhibit the autoxidation of ascorbate, prior to formation of reactive carbonyl compounds. AGE inhibitors had IC50 values for copper ranging from the millimolar range for AG and PM to micromolar values for carnosine, tenilsetam, DAP, and OPB-9195. These results indicate that AGE inhibitors have two mechanisms of action in vitro: first, inhibition of formation of reactive carbonyl intermediates; and second, nucleophilic reaction with these intermediates. High concentrations of AG and other inhibitors have been employed in many studies, including our own (23Fu M.X. Wells-Knecht K.J. Blackledge J.A. Lyons T.J. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 676-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Brownlee M. Vlassara H. Kooney A. Ulrich P. Cerami A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5430-5437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), on the mechanism of action of AGE inhibitors. These high inhibitor concentrations have been justified because of the high concentrations of glucose used to accelerate AGE formation in in vitro reactions. Based on the present work, however, it is more likely that AG, at concentrations in the 5–25 mm range,i.e. 2–10-fold higher than its IC50, exerts its primary effect by inhibiting autoxidation chemistry; this inhibition is observed not only with the copper-supplemented chelex-treated phosphate buffers used in our experiments, but also with commercial phosphate buffers containing traces of mixed metal ions. Similar results were obtained for AG and PM in the presence of iron salts, although iron was about 10-fold less effective as a catalyst of ascorbate autoxidation reactions at neutral pH. Other AGE inhibitors, such as carnosine, DAP, tenilsetam, and OPB-9195, which have much stronger metal binding activity (Table I), are likely to act primarily as chelators at the millimolar concentrations commonly employed for these reagents in vitro. Chelation may, therefore, confound the identification of AGE inhibitors,e.g. in two recent studies in which a large number of heterocyclic AGE inhibitors were described (27Rahbar S. Yernini K.K. Scott S. Gonzales N. Lalezari I. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 3: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 28Rahbar S. Yernini K.K. Scott S. Gonzales N. Lalezari I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) but are more likely to inhibit AGE formation through their chelation, rather than carbonyl trapping activity. For AG and PM, however, triazines (29Thornalley P.J. Yurek-George A. Argirov O.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and amides (30Onorato J.M. Jenkins A.J. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21177-21184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) have been identified as discrete adducts to carbonyl compounds during glycoxidation and lipoxidation reactions, confirming that, in addition to their chelating activity, they also act as true scavengers of carbonyl compounds. Similar experiments will have to be performed with other AGE inhibitors to confirm their proposed mechanism of action as carbonyl traps.Table IEstimated IC50 for inhibition of copper-catalyzed oxidation of ascorbic acid by various amines and AGE inhibitorsCompoundIC50μmPyridoxamine1000Pyridoxine3600Pyridoxal>5000Aminoguanidine2500Carnosine4Histidine12Taurine>5000Diaminophenazine50Tenilsetam25OPB-919551-aOptimal inhibitory concentration.

Open table in a new tab The estimate of the IC50 for inhibition of ascorbate oxidation is a useful, but comparative measure of the chelation activity of AGE inhibitors. It is the empirical result of equilibrium constants for metal binding by the multiple species of ascorbate (31Hayakawa K. Hayashi Y. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. (Tokyo). 1977; 23: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), the AGE inhibitor and the phosphate buffer ions in solution, rather than an actual Kd for the AGE inhibitor-metal complex. In most cases, except for pyridoxamine (32Gustafson R.L. Martell A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1957; 68: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and carnosine (33Baran E.J. Biochemistry (Moscow). 2000; 65: 789-797PubMed Google Scholar), true metal binding constants have not been measured. Because of the complexity of the equilibria involved, the IC50 for an AGE inhibitor will vary with buffer, metal ion, and ascorbate concentration, and even with the specific sugar under study,e.g. glucose, which exists to a lesser extent in the enolate conformation, would bind transition metal ions more weakly than ascorbate. Variations in the species and concentrations of metal ion contaminants in buffers will also affect the apparent IC50for specific inhibitors, depending on their respective binding constants with AGE inhibitors. How can one avoid the complex and confounding effects of chelation in studies on AGE inhibitors? One solution is to conduct these studies in the presence of a strong chelator, such as DTPA, so that the contribution of the AGE inhibitor to chelation would be minimal. However, DTPA itself is a potent inhibitor (>99% at 1 mm(23Fu M.X. Wells-Knecht K.J. Blackledge J.A. Lyons T.J. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 676-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) of AGE formation from glucose and ascorbate, so that reaction times would be excessive, even at high glucose concentration. We suggest that it may be best to evaluate the efficacy of AGE inhibitors by studying the browning of proteins by pentoses. Pentoses are 10–100 times more reactive than glucose with protein, so that lower concentrations of sugar can be used. Glycation of protein by pentoses also leads to formation of AGEs, cross-links and fluorescence characteristic of the modification of protein by glucose (34Lee K.W. Simpson G. Ortwerth B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1453: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Importantly, Maillard reactions of pentoses proceed readily under nitrogen and in the presence of chelators (35Litchfield J.E. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1297-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Experiments on the browning of proteins by pentoses can be conducted in the presence of strong chelator such as DTPA, so that the chelating activity of the inhibitor would not affect the kinetics of AGE formation in pentose model systems. The significance of the chelating activity of AGE inhibitors in vivo is difficult to assess, considering the powerful inhibition of ascorbate oxidation observed with albumin (Fig. 6). Yet, albumin is subject to metal-catalyzed oxidation and formation of Maillard products from glucose in vitro, and AGEs are present on albumin in vivo (36Miyata T. Fu M.X. Kurokawa K. van Ypersele de Strihou C. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 1290-1295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It is likely that metals bound to albumin are in equilibrium with metals bound to other proteins, and protein-bound metal ions, even when bound to proteins such as albumin (37Coussons P.J. Jacoby J. McKay A. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Hunt J.V. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 1217-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) or low density lipoprotein (38Lopes-Virella M.F. Koskinen S. Mironova M. Horne D. Klein R. Chassereau C. Enockson C. Virella G. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 152: 107-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), may remain redox-active and induce site-specific cleavage of the proteins in the presence of peroxide (39Hawkins C.L. Davies M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1360: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Despite lower binding constants, compared with albumin and chelators such as DTPA, AGE inhibitors may gradually deplete excess chelatable iron in the body by promoting the excretion of metal ion complexes in urine. Even a weak chelator, such as AG or PM, which might not inhibit autoxidation reactions significantly at therapeutic concentrations (<100 μm), could promote the gradual removal of free metal ions from tissues and plasma for excretion in urine, decreasing overall metal-catalyzed oxidative damage to proteins in vivo. Monnier and Eaton and co-workers (40Weiss M.F. Saxena A.K. Monnier V.M. Perit. Dial. Int. 1999; 19: S62-S67PubMed Google Scholar, 41Qian M. Eaton J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have proposed that AGEs on proteins may serve to bind redox-active, transition metal ions, enhancing local oxidative damage to proteins. If AGE inhibitors remove weakly bound metal ions from these “glycochelates,” they may both inhibit AGE formation (by chelation and/or carbonyl trapping) and also reduce other metal-catalyzed oxidative damage to tissues resulting from the presence of AGEs. Measurements of chelatable iron and copper in controlversus AGE inhibitor-treated animals should clarify the therapeutic significance of the weak chelating activity of AGE inhibitors. Notably, although chelators are not used clinically for the treatment of diabetic complications, chelators have recently proven effective in treatment of vascular disease (42Keegan A. Cotter M.A. Cameron N.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and neuropathy (43Cameron N.E. Cotter M.A. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in the STZ-diabetic rat. AGE inhibitors vary widely in their IC50 values in the ascorbate model system, from the millimolar range for AG and PM, to the micromolar range for carnosine, DAP, tenilsetam, and OPB-9195. At plasma concentrations of <100 μm, i.e. <10% of their IC50, both AG and PM were effective in inhibiting the formation of AGEs and development of complications in animal models of diabetes (5Degenhardt T.P. Alderson N.L. Arrington D.D. Beattie R.J. Basgen J.M. Steffes M.W. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Kidney Internat. 2001; (in press)Google Scholar). Among the stronger chelators, the concentration of carnosine in tissues (up to 20 mm) (44Quinn P.R. Boldyrev A.A. Formazuyk V.E. Mol. Aspects Med. 1992; 13: 379-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) far exceeds its IC50, while the therapeutic concentration of tenilsetam, ∼10 μm (45Burrows J.L. Coppin F.G. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 529: 486-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), is comparable with its IC50 in the ascorbate system (25 μm; Fig. 4B). The therapeutic concentrations of DAP and OPB-9195 have not been reported, but are probably also in the micromolar range, suggesting that chelation would contribute to their AGE inhibitory activity in vivo. The AGE-breakers PTB and PMTB were among the most potent inhibitors of copper-catalyzed oxidation of ascorbate, and the hydrolysis products of these compounds exhibited even stronger chelating activity. Hydrolysis of PTB leads to opening of the thiazolium ring, producing a sulfhydryl compound (46Thornalley P.J. Minhas H.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Mercaptans are excellent ligands for copper and other transition metals, which might explain the strong chelating activity of the hydrolysis products of PTB and PMTB. Because PTB also protectsEscherichia coli against MGO toxicity, almost as well as AG (47Furguson G.P. VanPatten S. Bucala R. Al-Abed Y. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), it is also possible that the hydrolysis products may have carbonyl trapping activity. The chelating properties of AGE-breakers is sufficiently strong that they may also have some lathyrogenic activity, inhibiting the enzymatic cross-linking of collagen, possibly leading to decreased cross-linking and greater elasticity of newly synthesized collagen. We have shown that AGE inhibitors have significant copper chelating activity. While we have not studied other metals in detail, similar inhibitory effects were observable with phosphate buffers containing a mixture of trace metal ions. The general metal chelating activity of AGE-directed drugs containing nitrogen and thiol groups most certainly contributes to the chelating activity of putative AGE inhibitors in vitro and could be important in their mechanism of action in vivo. Screening assays for AGE inhibition should account for metal chelation by working with inhibitor concentrations below their IC50 or by using pentoses as glycating agents. Identification and characterization of products trapped by the AGE inhibitors is also critical for confirming their mechanism of action. Defining the chelating versus carbonyl trapping activity of AGE inhibitors is essential for understanding the mechanism of action of these drugs and the possible benefits of chelation therapy in diabetes, and for developing more effective, clinically useful inhibitors of diabetic complications.

Amino acid sequences from purified rat core 1 β3-Gal-T (Ju, T., Cummings, R. D., and Canfield, W. M. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 169–177) were used to identify the core 1 β3-Gal-T sequences in the human expressed sequence tag data bases. A 1794-bp human core 1 β3-Gal-T cDNA sequence was determined by sequencing the expressed sequence tag and performing 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The core 1 β3-Gal-T predicts a 363-amino acid type II transmembrane protein. Expression of both the full-length and epitope-tagged soluble forms of the putative enzyme in human 293T cells generated core 1 β3-Gal-T activity that transferred galactose from UDP-Gal to GalNAcα1-O-phenyl, and a synthetic glycopeptide with Thr-linked GalNAc and the product was shown to have the core 1 structure. Northern analysis demonstrated widespread expression of core 1 β3-Gal-T in tissues with a predominance in kidney, heart, placenta, and liver. Highly homologous cDNAs were identified and cloned from rat, mouse, Drosophila melanogaster, andCaenorhabditis elegans, suggesting that the enzyme is widely distributed in metazoans. The core 1 β3-Gal-T sequence has minimal homology with conserved sequences found in previously described β3-galactosyltransferases, suggesting this enzyme is only distantly related to the known β3-galactosyltransferase family."

The acetylation status of the histone tails is determined by two opposing enzymatic activities, histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Here we describe the isolation and characterization of HDAC10, a novel class II histone deacetylase. Molecular cloning and Northern blot analyses reveal that the HDAC10 transcript is widely expressed and subjected to alternative splicing. HDAC10 is both nuclear and cytoplasmic, a feature reminiscent of HDACs 4, 5, and 7. Distinct from other family members, HDAC10 harbors an amino-terminal catalytic domain and a carboxyl pseudo-repeat that shares significant homology with its catalytic domain. Mutational analysis reveals that transcriptional repression by HDAC10 requires its intrinsic histone deacetylase activity. Taken together, HDAC10 represents a distinct HDAC that may play a role in transcription regulation."

Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), the arabinan of AG terminates only in a well defined hexaarabinofuranosyl (Ara6) structural motif, [β-d-Araf-(1→2)-α-d-Araf-(1→)]2-(3,5)-α-d-Araf-(1→5)-α-d-Araf(1Daffé M.

In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, two such Ara6 units were found to be further assembled into a unique Ara22-mer, the largest structurally defined arabinan unit to date (5Besra G.S. Khoo K.H.

Despite these advances, the precise structural details with respect to the number and further conjugation of the Ara22-mers to the -(β-d-Galf-(1→5)-β-d-Galf-(1→6)-)nscaffold remain unclear.

Bernasconi C. Stockbauer K.E. Wieles B. Musser J.M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Two of these genes were similar to the embA and embB genes described in M. avium, and the third one was termedembC. These genes are likely to be organized as an operon in the order embC, embA, and embB. It is reasonable to expect that these genes are transcribed as a single polycistronic mRNA from a unique promoter, but this has yet to be shown. However, a previous study (11Lety M.A. Nair S. Berche P. Escuyer V. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 2629-2633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) strongly implies that at least the embB gene can be expressed from its own individual promoter, the exact location of which still remains to be characterized. The embCAB gene cluster was initially identified in an EMB-resistant strain of M. smegmatis (10Telenti A. Philipp W.J. Sreevatsan S. Bernasconi C. Stockbauer K.E. Wieles B. Musser J.M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar,11Lety M.A. Nair S. Berche P. Escuyer V. Antimicrob.

The majority of M. tuberculosis clinical isolates resistant to EMB have mutations in embB (10Telenti A. Philipp W.J. Sreevatsan S. Bernasconi C. Stockbauer K.E. Wieles B. Musser J.M. Jacobs Jr., W.R.

Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and thus, the EmbB protein has been proposed as the main target of EMB. The Emb proteins are predicted to be integral membrane proteins with 11–13 transmembrane domains and a large carboxyl-terminal globular region of external location (10Telenti A. Philipp W.J. Sreevatsan S. Bernasconi C. Stockbauer K.E. Wieles B. Musser J.M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 14Ramaswamy S.V. Amin A.G. Goksel S.

Furthermore, M. smegmatis strains overexpressing embA, embB, and embC had increased arabinosyltransferase activities implying that embA, -B, and -C could encode arabinosyltransferases (9Belanger A.E. Besra G.S. Ford M.E. Mikusová K. Belisle J.T. Brennan P.J. Inamine J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11919-11924Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). However, heterologous expression of functional Emb proteins for direct biochemical assays or mechanistic studies has not been successful to allow unequivocal attribution of enzymatic activities. As an alternative, we took the reverse genetic approach to inactivate embA, -B, and -C genes individually and report here the resulting phenotypes and structural alterations associated with the arabinan component of the cell wall AG. Interruption of embA and -B led to a marked decrease in the total arabinose content. In particular, the terminal disaccharide β-d-Araf-(1→2)-α-d-Arafunit normally found on the 3-arm of the characteristic Ara6is largely missing in both mutants. This is the first report of AG-deficient mutants of mycobacteria with specific lesion in the terminal elaboration of arabinan that could be restored by complementing with the respective functional genes. Escherichia coli strain DH5α (15Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8210) Google Scholar) was grown at 37 °C on Luria-Bertani medium supplemented either with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), hygromycin (200 μg/ml), or gentamycin (15 μg/ml).M. smegmatis mc2155 (16Snapper S.B. Melton R.E. Mustafa S. Kieser T. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar) was grown at 37 °C in Middlebrook medium, either 7H9 (liquid) or 7H10 (solid), supplemented with oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase enrichment (Difco Laboratories), glycerol (0.2%), and Tween 80 (0.05%). Appropriate antibiotics were added when necessary at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml except for hygromycin (50 μg/ml). Transformation of E. coli was carried out according to standard procedure (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.82-1.84Google Scholar). Electrotransformation of M. smegmatis mc2155 was performed as described by Snapperet al. (16Snapper S.B. Melton R.E. Mustafa S. Kieser T. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). pBluescript II KS+ was purchased from Stratagene. pOLYG and pPR23 were kindly supplied by Dr. Ó. Gaora and Dr. B. Gicquel, respectively (18Garbe T.R. Barathi J. Barnini S. Zhang Y. Abou-Zeid C. Tang D. Mukherjee R. Young D.B.

Taq DNA polymerase was purchased from Promega. Plasmid DNAs were purified on Qiagen columns according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (Qiagen, GmbH). DNA fragments carrying internal sequences from embA and embC from M. smegmatis chromosome were amplified by PCR using the following primers: for embA, positions 1128–1257 and positions 3228–3257, according to the coding sequence, and for embC, positions 44–73 and positions 2083–2112 (GenBankTMaccession number U68480). Amplified DNA fragments were cloned into pBluescript, and a cassette conferring resistance to kanamycin (aphA-3) (20Trieu-Cuot P. Gerbaud G. Lambert T. Courvalin P. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3583-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) was inserted at the MscI site forembA and the NcoI site for embC. Resulting DNA fragments were finally subcloned into pPR23 (19Pelicic V. Jackson M. Reyrat J.M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10955-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), a suicide shuttle vector carrying the counterselection markersacB to give, respectively, pMAL-A and pMAL-C (Fig.1A). For the embB gene, a 2930-bp NruI fragment carrying the embB gene lacking its 5′-end was cloned into pBluescript. A 765-bp MscI-MluI intragenic fragment was deleted and replaced with a promoterless cassette conferring resistance to kanamycin (aphA-3ΔP). The resulting fragment was then subcloned into pPR23 to give pMAL-B (Fig. 1A). PMAL-A, -B, and -C were introduced into M. smegmatis by electroporation, and transformants were selected at 30 °C on Middlebrook 7H10 medium containing 5 μg/ml gentamycin. Transformants were grown in 7H9 liquid medium without selection and then plated at 42 °C on 7H10 supplemented with kanamycin (20 μg/ml) and sucrose (10%). Kanamycin-resistant and gentamicin-sensitive clones were analyzed by both PCR amplification with appropriate primers and Southern blot to confirm the double crossover events and replacement of wild-type sequences. For negative staining, samples of exponentially grown and stationary phase cells were fixed at room temperature for 10 min with formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1% and centrifuged, and the pellet was suspended in 0.5% phosphotungstic acid, pH 7 (21Nair S. Frehel C. Nguyen L. Escuyer V. Berche P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Formvar/carbon-coated grids were covered with one drop of bacterial suspension, air dried, and directly examined under the electron microscope (Jeol JEM-100CXII). For thin sectioning, samples were processed exactly as described previously (22Frehel C. Leduc M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 69: 210-217Crossref Google Scholar). Intracellular polysaccharides were stained by the method of Thiery (23Thiery J.P. J. Microsc. 1976; 6: 987-1018Google Scholar) as subsequently modified (22Frehel C. Leduc M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 69: 210-217Crossref Google Scholar). Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by plating cells on solid Middlebrook 7H10 medium supplemented with various concentrations of the tested drug. The minimal inhibitory concentration was defined as the first concentration of drug that inhibited 100% of growth after 5 days of incubation (9Belanger A.E. Besra G.S. Ford M.E. Mikusová K. Belisle J.T. Brennan P.J. Inamine J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11919-11924Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Cells (2 g of wet weight) were delipidated with hot absolute ethanol followed by a 2:1 chloroform:methanol extraction as described previously (24Khoo K.-H. Douglas E. Azadi P. Inamine J.M. Besra G.S. Mikusová K. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28682-28690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The dried residual biomass was rehydrated with phosphate-buffered saline and disrupted mechanically with the Soniprep 150 (Sanyo Gallenkamp PLC). The pulse time was 60 s disrupting and 90 s relaxing repeated six times. The suspension after cell breakage was extracted three times with 50% ethanol, each time centrifuging at 27,000 ×g. The supernatants were concentrated and partitioned between water and phenol to remove proteins (25Chatterjee D. Roberts A.D. Lowell K. Brennan P.J. Orme I.M. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The aqueous layer containing the majority of cellular LAM, lipomannan, and phosphatidylinositol mannosides was freeze-dried, reconstituted in the same volume of water, and used for SDS-PAGE. The core cell wall mycolylarabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex was obtained by extraction of the residual pellet with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% SDS followed by extensive washing of the insoluble residue in the same buffer. The SDS was removed by sequential washing with phosphate-buffered saline, water, and finally acetone. The insoluble residue (mAGP complex) was then solubilized by alkaline treatment with 1 m sodium hydroxide (1Daffé M. Brennan P.J. McNeil M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6734-6743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 16 h at 80 °C followed by neutralization and dialysis. The freeze-dried material was applied to a 26-mm × 1-m column of Sephacryl S-300 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) with Milli-Q water at ∼20 ml/h. Fractions were pooled on the basis of neutral sugar content and dried. Pools were analyzed by converting aliquots into alditol acetates after hydrolysis. Alditol acetates and partially methylated alditol acetates for GC/MS analysis were prepared according to the procedure described previously (22Frehel C. Leduc M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 69: 210-217Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, AG samples or permethylated derivatives were hydrolyzed with 2m trifluoroacetic acid for 2 h at 121 °C, reduced with 10 mg/ml sodium borodeuteride (NaBD4), 2m NH4OH at room temperature for 2 h, and then acetylated with acetic anhydride at 100 °C for 1 h. GC was carried out on an SP 2380 (30-m × 0.25-mm internal diameter, Supelco) column at an initial temperature of 50 °C held for 1 min. The temperature was then raised to 170 °C at 30 °C/min before increasing to 260 °C at 5 °C/min. GC/MS was carried out using a ThermoQuest Trace Gas Chromatograph 2000 (ThermoQuest, Austin, TX) connected to a GCQ/Polaris MS mass detector (ThermoQuest). The partially methylated alditol acetates were dissolved in chloroform prior to injection on a DB-5 column (10-m × 0.18-mm internal diameter, J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA) at an initial temperature of 50 °C held for 1 min. The temperature was raised to 150 °C at 30 °C/min before increasing to 260 °C at 5 °C/min. Selective growth of a soil microorganism, Cellulomonas gelida, from which the endoarabinanase was purified, has been described previously (26McNeil M.R. Robuck K.G. Harter M. Brennan P.J. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To ensure a consistent result, 10 μg of each AG sample were treated with 5 μl of the enzyme preparation for 8 h at 37 °C. Aliquots from the digestion product mixtures that contained the released oligoarabinosides and oligogalactosides were analyzed directly by high pH anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC). Analytical HPAEC was performed on a Dionex LC system fitted with a Dionex Carbopac PA-1 column, and the oligoglycosides were detected with a pulse-amperometric detector (PAD-II). Samples were permethylated using the NaOH/dimethyl sulfoxide slurry method or were perdeuteroacetylated with the pyridine:d6-acetic anhydride method as described by Dell et al. (27Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Electrospray MS analyses were performed on an Autospec orthogonal acceleration-time of flight mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom) fitted with an electrospray source assembly and operated at 4 kV accelerating voltage. Samples were dissolved in methanol, and 10-μl aliquots were injected through a Rheodyne loop into the mobile phase (methanol:water:acetic acid, 50:50:1, v/v/v), delivered at a flow rate of 5 μl/min into the electrospray source by a syringe pump. One-dimensional 1H and 13C DEPT (distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer) experiments were performed on a Varian Inova AM-400 and1H 13C two-dimensional HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy) NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian Inova 500 MHz NMR spectrometer (NIH-SIG RR11981) using the supplied Varian pulse sequences. Spectra were acquired after several lyophilizations with D2O on a solution of 10 mg/0.6 ml in 100% D2O. The HSQC data were acquired with a 7-kHz window for proton in F2 and a 15-kHz window for carbon in F1. The total recycle time was 1.65 s between transients. Adiabatic decoupling was applied to carbon during proton acquisition. Pulsed field gradients were used throughout for artifact suppression but were not used for coherence selection. The data set consisted of 1K complex points in t2 by 256 complex points in t1 using States-TPPI. Forward linear prediction was used for resolution enhancement to expand t1 to 512 complex points. A cosine-squared weighting function and zero filling were applied to both t1 and t2 prior to the Fourier transform. The final resolution was 3.5 Hz/point in F2 and 15 Hz/point in F1. The three mutants embA−,embB−, and embC− were generated by homologous recombination using the thermosensitive vector pPR23 containing embA, embB, or embCintragenic fragments disrupted by the aphA-3 cassette conferring resistance to kanamycin (20Trieu-Cuot P. Gerbaud G. Lambert T. Courvalin P. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3583-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) (Fig.1A). To confirm the allelic exchange, chromosomal DNA was prepared from the mutants, and PCR amplifications were performed using primers that yield amplification products only after the double recombination event occurred. Amplification products of the expected size were obtained with the three emb− mutants (Fig. 1B); no amplification was obtained with the wild-type (WT) strain. Southern blot analysis was also performed on the chromosomal DNA from the mutants, which confirmed the results obtained with PCR. Therefore, both PCR and Southern blot experiments demonstrated that the threeemb− mutants were the result of allelic exchange involving replacement of the emb genes with the disrupted emb constructs and loss of the vector. WT, embA−,embB−, and embC−strains were examined during the exponential phase of growth for morphological changes. Thin sections of WT showed typical morphology with long rods, regular septation, and bacterial sizes of ∼5.5 μm (Fig. 2a). In contrast, theembB− mutant showed drastically altered morphology with size shortening (∼2.8 μm), swelling, and distortion (Fig. 2c). Accumulation of translucent cytoplasmic inclusions could also be observed (Fig. 2c). TheembA− mutant was also altered in its morphology with size shortening (∼2.9 μm), slight distortion, and swelling but to a lesser extent than with the embB− mutant (Fig. 2b). The embC− mutant exhibited a shorter size (∼4.9 μm) but with a nonaltered shape (Fig. 2d). In this study, it was also found that interruption of the emb genes resulted in a severe alteration in the physiological behavior of the bacterium in several respects: for instance, complete loss of acid fastness for bothembB− and embA− strains and only partial acid fastness in the case of theembC− mutant. In addition, susceptibility of these mutants to the hydrophobic antibiotics rifampicin and novobiocin was enhanced (minimal inhibitory concentrations of 125 and 60 μg/ml for the WT in comparison to minimal inhibitory concentrations of 25 and 4 μg/ml for the embA−, 1.5 and 0.25 μg/ml for the embB−, and 40 and 25 μg/ml for theembC−), indicating altered permeability of the mutant strains. These results pointed to the probability that theemb− mutants had an altered cell wall. The peculiar morphological variations observed among the emb− mutants and the evidence that the emb genes encode for key proteins in AG biosynthesis (9Belanger A.E. Besra G.S. Ford M.E. Mikusová K. Belisle J.T. Brennan P.J. Inamine J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11919-11924Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) led us to analyze the structure of the arabinan of AG from these mutants. Cell wall core (mAGP) was prepared from WT and theembA−, -B−, and -C− as described previously (24Khoo K.-H. Douglas E. Azadi P. Inamine J.M. Besra G.S. Mikusová K. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28682-28690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and the ratio of Ara to Gal in mAGP was determined by gas chromatography of the alditol acetates prepared after hydrolysis (28Daffé M. McNeil M. Brennan P.J. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 249: 383-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The glycosyl composition was calculated based on a single rhamnosyl (Rha) residue per AG chain (Table I) (2McNeil M. Daffé M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18200-18206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The AG preparation from the WT mAGP was found to contain ∼100 glycosyl residues with a relative molar ratio of Rha:Gal:Ara of 1:29:64 and an Ara:Gal ratio of 2.2:1 in accord with previous data (1Daffé M. Brennan P.J. McNeil M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6734-6743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All threeemb− mutants yielded AG with significant reduction in Ara content concomitant with an increase in the amount of Gal (Table I), although the effect was less dramatic withembC−. In accord with the extent of morphological alteration, the AG from the embB−mutant also gave the lowest Ara:Gal ratio (0.88:1) followed byembA− (1.01:1) andembC− (1.4:1). When complemented in trans with respective WT emb genes, theembA− and embB− mutants were able to synthesize AG with a glycosyl composition identical to the WT AG. This total synthesis of normal AG with a WT copy of the gene corroborates that the defect in AG observed in theembA− and embB− mutants was a direct consequence of the interruption of these genes. Synthesis of AG with embC complementation, however, was less complete, suggesting that the effect of embC inactivation on AG expression could be partly due to a polar effect on the expression ofembA and/or embB located directly downstream. However, this remains to be directly demonstrated, and the exact cause of the AG defect in the embC− mutant is under further investigation. Based on the complementation experiments, the presence of the individual embB promoter is confirmed, and in addition, the existence of an individual promoter forembA is also strongly suggested. Thus, embA andembB genes can be expressed from their own individual promoters, but the genetic organization of the emb genes also indicates that, in addition, a polycistronic mRNA encoding the three Emb proteins could also be synthesized. Further analysis of the LAM preparation from embA− andembB− revealed no difference in composition from that of LAM from the WT, indicating that the embAB gene products are specifically involved in the biosynthesis of AG (data not shown). In contrast, full-size LAM could not be obtained from theembC− mutant, suggesting that theembC gene product is involved in the synthesis of LAM. Further detailed analysis of the latter aspects of embC gene inactivation will be reported elsewhere. 2D. Chatterjee and V. E. Escuyer, manuscript in preparation.

First described in China in the 1980s, RHDV has spread at an alarming rate in the rabbit population throughout Asia, Europe, and Australia. Caliciviruses cause a number of severe diseases in other mammals; in humans, Norwalk viruses are responsible for ∼95% of cases of non-bacterial gastroenteritis and represent a growing public health problem in need of new, more effective treatments (3Green K.Y. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 181: S252-S253Google Scholar). Caliciviruses are also closely related to the picornaviruses (e.g. polio virus, rhinovirus, and foot-and-mouth disease virus) and to the flaviviruses (e.g. hepatitis C, dengue, and yellow fever viruses), which cause many serious diseases in humans and other mammals. A virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) is the central enzyme responsible for replicating the genomic RNA of caliciviruses and other positive-stranded RNA viruses (4O'Reilly E.K. Kao C.C. Virology. 1998; 252: 287-303Google Scholar). The RHDV RdRP has been produced in Escherichia coli and has been shown to efficiently synthesize RNA from RNA primer-template duplexes in the presence of divalent cations and ribonucleoside triphosphates (5López Vázquez A.

Structural and enzymological studies on a wide range of RdRPs are beginning to reveal the essential features of RdRP function, and it is hoped that this body of molecular information will facilitate the design of more effective treatments for viral diseases. Although the previously determined crystal structures of the PV and HCV RdRPs have shed light on the structural basis of polymerase function, many important questions remain to be addressed. Most importantly, the pair of metal ions seen in the active sites of catalytically active DNA polymerases was not present in any of these structures (the HCV RdRP·Mn2+·UTP complex structure has been determined to 2.7 Å, but details are not given (9Ago H. Adachi T. Yoshida A. Yamamoto M. Habuka N. Yatsunami K. Miyano M. Structure. 1999; 7: 1417-1426Google Scholar)). As a result, the details of interactions between RdRPs, RNA primer-template duplexes, nucleoside triphosphates, and metal ions can only be modeled based on the structures of more distantly related DNA polymerases, DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, and reverse transcriptases (12Gohara D. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25523-25532Google Scholar, 13Doublie S. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Structure. 1999; 7: R31-R35Google Scholar, 14Jaeger J. Pata J.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 21-28Google Scholar). Further work is also needed to elucidate how RdRPs initiate RNA replication through a series of interactions with the RNA genome and accessory proteins (15Machı́n A. Martı́n Alonso J.M. Parra F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27787-27792Google Scholar, 16Paul A.V. van Boom J.H. Filippov D. Wimmer E. Nature. 1998; 393: 280-284Google Scholar, 17Andino R. Boddeker N. Silvera D. Gamarnik A.V. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 76-82Google Scholar). As a step toward understanding the structural basis of RNA replication in positive-stranded RNA viruses, we have determined the structure of the RHDV RdRP to a 2.5-Å resolution. The complete structure of the enzyme has been determined in two independent copies in the asymmetric unit, which reveal the polymerase in both active and inactive conformations. Divalent metal ions are bound to the enzyme under physiological ionic strength conditions, and the active site cleft is open to the binding of RNA primer-template duplexes. Comparisons between the RHDV RdRP structure and the previously determined structures of PV and HCV RdRPs indicate that conformational changes similar to those seen in DNA polymerases may be important to the catalytic mechanism of RdRPs. Wild-type RHDV RdRP protein was purified fromE. coli XL1-Blue, transformed with the expression plasmid pGEX-3D, and grown on Luria-Bertani medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) as described previously (5López Vázquez A. Martı́n Alonso J.M. Casais R. Boga J.A. Parra F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2999-3004Google Scholar). Selenomethionine was incorporated into RHDV RdRP using the methionine auxotroph B834(DE3)pLysS grown in M9 minimal media supplemented with 0.3 mmseleno-l-methionine and 1 mg/liter each of riboflavin, niacinamide, pyridoxine-HCl, and thiamin. In all cases the fusion protein from isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced cultures was purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and digested with thrombin to release the polymerase as described previously (5López Vázquez A. Martı́n Alonso J.M. Casais R. Boga J.A. Parra F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2999-3004Google Scholar). The buffers used to purify selenomethionine-RdRP were supplemented with 2 mmβ-mercapthoethanol. The fractions containing the purified polymerase were pooled and mixed with an equal volume of a saturated solution of ammonium sulfate. The precipitates were redissolved at ∼20 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and dialyzed for 2 h against 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. UTP was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Protein (∼15 mg/ml) and precipitant solution (10–12% PEG 8000, 0.1m Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m sodium thiocyanate, 0.1 m l-proline, 15% (w/v) glycerol, 7% (v/v) 1,6-hexanediol, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2) were mixed in equal volumes (2 μl of each) and equilibrated over the precipitant solution as a hanging drop. Large rod- or plate-like crystals (0.5–1.0 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm) used for data collection were grown by both macroseeding and microseeding over the course of 3–5 days. The space group was P212121. Selenomethionine-containing crystals grown in this manner were used for data collection, multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing, and structure determination. To grow crystals for high resolution data collection, CaCl2and MgCl2 were replaced with 5 mmLuCl3 (Aldrich) and grown as described above. To increase the occupancy of divalent metal ions at the active site, crystals were also grown using a precipitant solution of 9% PEG 8000, 0.1m Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mmMg(NO3)2, 0.1 m 1,7-diaminoheptane, 15% (w/v) glycerol, 7% (v/v) 1,6-hexanediol, and 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS. These crystals were then soaked in a solution containing 12% PEG 8000, 50 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.5, 18 mm MnCl2, 15% glycerol, and 7% hexanediol for 20 h before being transferred to a solution containing the same components plus 10 mm 3′-deoxy-ATP (Sigma) and then soaked for an additional 40 min. Crystals soaked for longer times did not show improved electron density for either 3′-deoxy-ATP or metal ions. 2K. K. S. Ng, M. M. Cherney, A. López Vázquez, Á. Machı́n, J. M. Martı́n Alonso, F. Parra, and M. N. G. James, unpublished observations. The structure of RHDV RdRP was determined using the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion technique. Data from a flash-cooled crystal (0.5 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm, quickly adapted to precipitant solution containing 25% glycerol and cooled under nitrogen gas at 100 K) were measured at beamline 9–2 (Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory) using an ADSC Quantum-4 detector and processed using the HKL suite (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar). Local-scaling, Patterson searches and phasing calculations were performed using SOLVE (19Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Google Scholar). Only 22 of the 26 selenium atoms predicted from the amino acid sequence were located from Patterson or Fourier searches; the missing selenium atoms corresponding to Met-143 and Met-515 were poorly ordered in both copies of the protein in the asymmetric unit and did not give rise to strong peaks in either the anomalous Patterson and Fourier syntheses. Density modification using DM (20Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1555-1567Google Scholar) improved the quality of the electron density map (the figure of merit increased from 0.54 to 0.75 (40–2.7 Å)). The electron density map was skeletonized using MAPMAN, and a main chain trace was constructed using O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). Non-crystallographic symmetry averaging was attempted using DM, but the resulting statistics and electron density maps did not indicate significant improvements. An analysis of the refined structure indicates that the two copies in the asymmetric unit differ substantially (root mean squared difference (r.m.s.d.) of 1.2 Å for 482 Cα atoms within 3.8 Å of each other following superposition) due to different orientations of the thumb and N-terminal domains relative to the fingers and palm domains. Initial rounds of refinement against a maximum likelihood target function, including experimentally determined phase information, were performed using CNS (22Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). A second data set measured from crystals of wild-type protein crystallized in the presence of 5 mm LuCl3 was measured at the BM-14-C beamline (BioCARS sector, Advanced Photon Source). The structure built from the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data was further refined against these higher resolution data. After refining temperature factors for individual atoms, the R-factor was 0.23, and the free R-factor was 0.29. REFMAC v.5.0.36 was then used to refine separate anisotropic temperature factor tensors (23Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Google Scholar) for the N-terminal, fingers, palm, and thumb domains, further lowering the R-factor to 0.22 and the free R-factor to 0.27. Four residues at the N terminus and 15 residues at the C terminus are too poorly ordered in both copies to be modeled. Residues 181–184 in copy A are also too poorly ordered to be modeled. There are no outliers in the Ramachandran plot with 88% of the 998 residues in the favored regions. Because of apparently low occupancies of metal ions in this data set, crystallization conditions were further modified in an attempt to increase the occupancies of bound metal ions. It was found that removal of KSCN and replacement with either NaNO3 or Mg(NO3)2 increased occupancies (as monitored by the height of the peak corresponding to the divalent metal ion in ( Fo − Fc )αcalc and ( F+ − F− )αcalc electron density maps). In a further attempt to improve the occupancies of metal ions and possibly to stabilize a catalytically competent state, the crystal was soaked in 18 mm MnCl2 for 24 h and then soaked in 18 mm MnCl2 + 10 mm3′-deoxyadenosine-triphosphate for 45 min. This crystal was flash-frozen at ∼100 K, and data were measured using CuKα radiation (Rigaku H3R generator, confocal mirrors) and an R-Axis IV++ image plate detector (Rigaku). Refinement and model building was performed on this structure beginning with the fully refined 2.5-Å resolution LuCl3 cocrystal structure. The RHDV RdRP adopts the overall structure of a right hand with domains corresponding to the fingers, palm, and thumb, as seen in the three-dimensional structures of most other polynucleotide polymerases (24Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17395-17398Google Scholar) (Figs. 1 and 2). In addition, there is an N-terminal segment bridging the fingers and thumb domains that appears to be unique to the RdRPs (4O'Reilly E.K. Kao C.C. Virology. 1998; 252: 287-303Google Scholar, 11Lesburg C.A. Cable M.B. Ferrari E. Hong Z. Mannarino A.F. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 937-943Google Scholar). The overall architecture is very similar to that of the PV and HCV RdRPs despite sharing less than 20% sequence identity with PV and only 10% sequence identity with HCV (Fig. 2). Superpositions of the PV and HCV structures onto the RHDV structure (accepting Cα atoms within 3.5 Å of each other as equivalent) allow the superposition of 233 and 223 Cαatoms with an r.m.s.d. of 1.65 and 1.88 Å, respectively. The crystallographic data are shown in TableI.Figure 2Ribbon diagrams of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases shown from a similar vantage point.A, RHDV; B, PV (PDB code 1RDR) (8Hansen J.L. Long A.M.

The Ca2+ ion found near the active site in the polio virus structure is drawn as a gray sphere. There were no bound metal ions reported in the HCV RdRP structures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table ICrystallographic dataData setMADLu3+Mn2+ + 3′-dATPEdgePeakRemoteCrystal data Unit cell (Å)a70.7370.3070.69b118.87119.10119.85c159.04158.70159.50Data collection Wavelength (Å)0.97950.97930.88560.981.5418 Resolution (Å)100–2.7100–2.7100–2.7100–2.540–2.7 High resolution (Å)2.8–2.72.8–2.72.8–2.72.6–2.52.8–2.7 Total obs.296011291987295765125565219584 Unique refl.1-aCalculated by treating Bijvoet pairs as equivalent.3710637091370804294337963 〈I〉/〈ς〉20.5 (8.3)1-bValues in parentheses refer to the high resolution shell.23.1 (8.6)27.8 (7.5)13.6 (2.7)17.4 (2.4) Completeness1-aCalculated by treating Bijvoet pairs as equivalent.99.6 (99.6)99.6 (99.6)99.6 (100.0)91.4 (82.4)99.9 (100) Rsym1-cRsym = ΣhΣi (‖Ii(h) − 〈I(h)〉‖)/ΣhΣiIi(h), where Ii(h) is the ithintensity measurement and 〈I(h)〉 is the weighted mean of all measurements of I(h).6.8 (25.7)6.4 (24.5)5.5 (25.6)3.9 (25.4)9.7 (72.2) Ranom1-dRanom = Σh(‖I+(h) −I−(h)‖)/Σh(I+(h) + I−(h)), where I+ (h) andI− (h) are the Bijvoet pairs ofI(h).6.0 (9.5)5.4 (8.7)4.1 (9.3)3.0 (18.2)4.3 (33.1)Refinement Rwork1-eRwork andRfree = Σh∥F(h)obs‖ − ‖F(h)calc∥/‖F(h)obs‖ for reflections in the working and test sets (10% of all data), respectively.0.2180.235 Rfree1-eRwork andRfree = Σh∥F(h)obs‖ − ‖F(h)calc∥/‖F(h)obs‖ for reflections in the working and test sets (10% of all data), respectively.0.2680.270 No. of protein atoms79547954 No. of water molecules11632 r.m.s.d. bond lengths (Å)0.0070.008 r.m.s.d. bond angles (°)1.191.251-a Calculated by treating Bijvoet pairs as equivalent.1-b Values in parentheses refer to the high resolution shell.1-c Rsym = ΣhΣi (‖Ii(h) − 〈I(h)〉‖)/ΣhΣiIi(h), where Ii(h) is the ithintensity measurement and 〈I(h)〉 is the weighted mean of all measurements of I(h).1-d Ranom = Σh(‖I+(h) −I−(h)‖)/Σh(I+(h) + I−(h)), where I+ (h) andI− (h) are the Bijvoet pairs ofI(h).1-e Rwork andRfree = Σh∥F(h)obs‖ − ‖F(h)calc∥/‖F(h)obs‖ for reflections in the working and test sets (10% of all data), respectively. Open table in a new tab The N-terminal domain (residues 1–63) consists of two short β-strands, one pairing with a β-sheet in the fingers domain and one pairing with a β-strand in the thumb domain, as well as three long loop segments. This domain forms a bridge between the fingers and thumb domains, which do not interact with each other directly. The N-terminal domain in HCV RdRP (residues 1–49) also forms a bridge between the fingers and thumb domains. However, the conformation of the polypeptide chain, as well as packing interactions with the fingers and thumb domains, differs substantially from what is seen in the RHDV RdRP. Significant conformational variability in the N-terminal domain (particularly residues 21–24 and 51–64) is seen between the two copies of the RHDV RdRP in the asymmetric unit. These differences in conformation depend on neighboring crystal lattice contacts and likely reflect the intrinsic conformational flexibility of these regions. Conformational flexibility may also explain the apparent disorder in most of the N-terminal domain of the PV RdRP crystal structure (8Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Google Scholar). Of the ordered residues in the N-terminal domain of PV RdRP, only residues 23–29 are similar to the RHDV RdRP structure (residues 32–38). Residues 12–23 of PV RdRP thread into the active site, thus blocking access of the primer and template RNA into the active site cleft. In contrast, the corresponding segment of RHDV RdRP (residues 21–32) extends away from the active site cleft, leaving room for the binding of RNA (Figs. 2 and 5). The fingers domain (residues 64–215 and 259–312) consists of eight α-helices and a five-stranded β-sheet (one strand contributed by the N-terminal domain) referred to previously as the “fingertips” in HIV-1 RT and HCV RdRP (10Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Roussel A. Incitti I. Vitale R.L. De Mathieu M. Francesco R. Rey F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1999; 96: 13034-13039Google Scholar). Despite sharing virtually undetectable sequence similarity (less than 15% identity), the topology of the fingers domain is very similar to that seen in the HCV RdRP and the ordered parts of the mostly disordered PV RdRP fingers domain. This observation, as well as our own preliminary threading studies, strongly suggests that the fingers domain in a wide range of viral RNA polymerases will share a similar architecture. The β-sheet, a long loop (residues 167–193), and an α-helix (residues 63–77) form extensive interactions with the N-terminal domain. A feature of the fingers domain unique to RdRP structures is a helix-loop-helix insertion (residues 259–289) that buttresses the outer face of the fingers domain. Three α-helices (residues 85–103, 205–215, and 259–272) form a well packed interface with a long, buried α-helix (residues 312–335) of the palm domain. The palm domain (residues 216–258 and 312–384) consists of a three-stranded β-sheet (residues 245–250 and 347–360) sandwiched between a pair of α-helices (residues 312–335 and 367–378) on one face and a single α-helix (residues 230–241) on the other. The architecture of this domain is the most highly conserved feature of all known polymerases (4O'Reilly E.K. Kao C.C. Virology. 1998; 252: 287-303Google Scholar). An analysis of polymerase sequences and structures has identified six recurring motifs responsible for NTP binding and catalysis. The central three-stranded β-sheet consists of a β-strand (residues 245–250, Motif A) and a β-hairpin (residues 349–360, Motif C) that contains the “GDD” sequence almost universally conserved in the RdRPs (25Koonin E.V. Dolja V.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 375-430Google Scholar). Metal ions that are likely to be involved in the nucleotidyl transfer reaction interact with aspartate residues at positions 250, 354, and 355, as discussed in greater detail below. A long loop followed by a pair of β-strands (residues 404–417) completes the palm domain and forms an interface with the mostly helical thumb domain. This palm-thumb interface region is similar in all RdRPs and in HIV-1 RT. The thumb domain (residues 418–501 in RHDV RdRP) comprises four α-helices and two long loops linking together the first and second and the third and fourth α-helices. This domain has a similar structure to that seen in the PV RdRP and reveals a striking difference to that of the HCV thumb domain (Fig. 2). The long loop or flap (residues 428–446) connecting the first and second helices is folded away from the active site cleft and packs against the N-terminal domain. In contrast, the corresponding parts of the PV (residues 401–410) and HCV (residues 406–412) structures are shorter turns. The most dramatic difference among RdRP structures occurs in the loop (residues 483–489) connecting the third and fourth helices in PV and RHDV. In HCV RdRP, this loop is replaced by a long β-hairpin insert (residues 446–462) that occludes the active site cleft. In HCV, replacement of this β-hairpin with a short turn allows the enzyme to use double-stranded RNA templates that the wild-type enzyme is unable to use as templates (26Hong Z. Cameron C.E. Walker M.P. Castro C. Yao N. Lau J.Y.N. Zhong W. Virology. 2001; 285: 6-11Google Scholar). The shorter loops seen in the PV and RHDV enzymes are consistent with the ability of these enzymes to utilize double-stranded RNA as templates (7López Vázquez A. Martı́n Alonso J.M. Parra F. Arch. Virol. 2001; 146: 59-69Google Scholar). The HCV RdRP also differs from both PV and RHDV enzymes by possessing three additional helices preceding a unique C-terminal transmembrane segment. The two copies of the RHDV polymerase in the asymmetric unit differ substantially from each other. Superimposition of the two copies of the asymmetric unit reveals that the fingers domain and the N-terminal portion of the palm domain form a rigid unit about which the N-terminal and thumb domains, as well as a segment of the palm domain, pivot. Superimposition of the fingers and palm domains (residues 64–415) yields an r.m.s.d. of 0.7 Å over 343 Cα atoms (only atoms within 3.8 Å of each other are included in the calculation), and superimposition of the thumb domain (residues 415–501) by itself yields an r.m.s.d. of 0.4 Å over 87 Cα atoms. However, superimposition of the entire polymerase yields an r.m.s.d. of 1.2 Å over 482 Cαatoms. The relative positioning of the thumb relative to the palm domain differs substantially between the two copies of the asymmetric unit. Superimposition of the palm domains of both copies shows that the N-terminal region and thumb domain of copy A is rotated toward the palm domain by 8° about an axis roughly lying between the thumb and palm domains (Fig. 3). Analysis of the conformational change using the program DynDom (27Hayward S. Berendsen H.J.C. Proteins. 1998; 30: 144-154Google Scholar) identifies the same dynamic domains and pinpoints residues 63–64 and 417–418 as hinge residues. An analysis of the crystal packing interactions of the two different copies in the asymmetric unit reveals that neighboring molecules in the crystal lattice may stabilize the closed conformation seen in copy A. Crystal packing interactions with the N-terminal domain (residues 5–63) of copy A and the “back” of the palm domain of copy A (residues 246–253 and 381–384) help to push these domains inward and close off the active site cleft relative to the open conformation of copy B. The RHDV RdRP can be crystallized under conditions of moderate ionic strength and in the presence of divalent cations (Mg2+, Mn2+, and Fe2+) that are required for catalyzing the nucleotidyl transfer reaction (5López Vázquez A. Martı́n Alonso J.M. Casais R. Boga J.A. Parra F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2999-3004Google Scholar, 6López Vázquez A. Martı́n Alonso J.M. Parra F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3888-3891Google Scholar). The conformations adopted by the two active sites present in the asymmetric unit can vary dramatically depending on the ions present in the mother liquor of the crystals and on the different crystal packing environments surrounding each active site (Fig.4). In the high resolution (2.5 Å) structure of the crystals grown in the presence of Lu3+, one Lu3+ ion is bound between the side chain carboxylate groups of Asp-354 and Asp-250 in copy A (Fig. 4A). The electron density and refined temperature factor for the Lu3+ ion indicate partial occupancy (∼0.2), as does the longer than expected coordination distances (2.5–3.0 Å) between the carboxylate oxygens and the Lu3+ ion. Despite the apparently low occupancy, the Lu3+ ion contributes significant anomalous scattering that is easily detectable in an anomalous differences Fourier map. On the other hand, in copy B, there is no indication of an ion binding between Asp-354 and Asp-250, but there is a peak between the carboxylate group of Asp-355 and the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Leu-249. This Lu3+ ion refines to even lower occupancy (<0.2), and the coordination distances are also longer than expected (Fig. 4B). In the presence of Lu3+, copy B of the polymerase adopts an open conformation in which the active site aspartic acid residues are clearly too far apart from each other to coordinate to metal ions in an active configuration. Copy A adopts a more closed conformation in which the active site aspartic acid residues are nearly close enough together to adopt a fully active conformation. Altering the ionic environment of the crystals can increase the occupancies of the Lu3+ ions at the enzyme active site, but the quality of diffraction appears to worsen. 3K. K. S. Ng, M. M. Cherney, A. López Vázquez, Á. Machı́n, J. M. Martı́n Alonso, F. Parra, and M. N. G. James, unpublished observations. In the presence of 18 mm MnCl2 and 10 mm 3′-deoxy-ATP, the active site of copy A tightens up even more. Two Mn2+ ions are clearly bound between the two carboxylate side chains of Asp-354 and Asp-250 and the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Tyr-251 (Fig. 4C). The coordination distances between oxygen atoms and metal ions are reasonable (1.9–2.1 Å), and the occupancies of the metal ions refine to ∼0.8. This closed conformation of copy A is probably the active form of the enzyme because the ion coordination closely matches with that seen in active enzyme·NTP·primer-template complexes formed by related DNA-dependent DNA polymerases and the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (13Doublie S. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Structure. 1999; 7: R31-R35Google Scholar, 28Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Google Scholar). In agreement with this hypothesis, previous studies have demonstrated that Asp-354 could not be replaced by any other amino acid residue; even a conservative Asp to Glu substitution completely abolished enzyme activity (5López Vázquez A. Martı́n Alonso J.M. Casais R. Boga J.A. Parra F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2999-3004Google Scholar, 6López Vázquez A. Martı́n Alonso J.M. Parra F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3888-3891Google Scholar). In addition, point mutant studies directed at Asp-250 also resulted in inactive polymerase proteins when this residue was substituted either by Ala, Asn, or Glu, further supporting the involvement of Asp-250 in ion binding. 4J. M. Martín Alonso, M. Norling, and F. Parra, unpublished data. Although 3′-deoxy-ATP is present in the crystals, electron density corresponding to the nucleotide is not clearly defined. There is additional electron density near the metal ions, which has been, at present, modeled as water molecules (Fig. 4C), although this most likely results from a mixture of solvent molecules and portions of a poorly ordered nucleoside triphosphate. In the presence of Mn2+, the active site of copy B is more open than that of copy A and is similar to the active site conformation seen in copy B of the Lu3+-containing crystals. Although the polymerase active site is buried in the center of the protein, distant and indirect crystal packing forces appear to stabilize the alternate conformational states of the active site seen in the different copies of the asymmetric unit. As described above, crystal packing forces stabilize small rotations of the thumb domain and the back of the palm domain toward the center of the palm in copy A. These domain rotations may help stabilize a conformation that is competent for the binding of catalytic metal ions, NTPs, and RNA substrates. In contrast, crystal packing forces around copy B cause the back strand in the central β-sheet of the palm domain (Motif A, residues 245–250) to be displaced slightly relative to the central β-hairpin (Motif C, residues 349–360). As a result, Asp-250 adopts a different rotamer and is too far from Asp-354 to coordinate a metal ion. Consequently, the active site in copy B adopts an inactive conformation. Because the palm domain of the RHDV RdRP is very similar to the palm domains of the DNA-dependent DNA polymerases from T7 phage (29Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Google Scholar), Thermus aquaticus (Taq) (30Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Google Scholar), and RB69 phage (31Franklin M.C. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 657-667Google Scholar), as well as to the reverse transcriptase from human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) (28Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Google Scholar), it is possible to model the interactions of a nucleotide triphosphate and a primer-template duplex with the RHDV RdRP (Fig. 5). This modeling shows that the active site cleft of the RHDV RdRP (copy A) can accommodate a primer-template duplex without major steric clashes. The positively charged side chains of lysine and arginine residues also appear poised to interact with the phosphodiester backbone of the primer-template duplex (Arg-404 and Lys-114, Lys-134, and Lys-403 near the primer and Arg-434 and Lys-26, Lys-173, and Lys-213 near the template) and the triphosphate moiety of the nucleotide (Arg-177 and Arg-188 and Lys-403). Arg-177 corresponds to Lys-65 in HIV-1 RT, which interacts with the γ-phosphate of the NTP bound in the ternary complex of that enzyme (28Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Google Scholar, 32Sluis-Cremer N. Arion D. Kaushik N. Lim H. Parniak M.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 77-82Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, in contrast to the open active site cleft of RHDV RdRP (copy A), the structure of PV RdRP shows that a segment from the N terminus lies in the active site cleft, and the presence of disorder in much of the fingers and N-terminal domains prevents a detailed prediction of RNA substrate binding to PV RdRP (8Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Google Scholar). In HCV RdRP, two loops from the thumb domain, as well as a segment of the C-terminal polypeptide, sterically occlude the active site cleft from the binding of primer-template duplexes (9Ago H. Adachi T. Yoshida A. Yamamoto M. Habuka N. Yatsunami K. Miyano M. Structure. 1999; 7: 1417-1426Google Scholar, 10Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Roussel A. Incitti I. Vitale R.L. De Mathieu M. Francesco R. Rey F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1999; 96: 13034-13039Google Scholar, 11Lesburg C.A. Cable M.B. Ferrari E. Hong Z. Mannarino A.F. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 937-943Google Scholar). These segments of the HCV enzyme must move out of the active site cleft to allow RNA and nucleoside triphosphate to bind to the enzyme (26Hong Z. Cameron C.E. Walker M.P. Castro C. Yao N. Lau J.Y.N. Zhong W. Virology. 2001; 285: 6-11Google Scholar). The palm domains of the PV and HCV apoenzyme RdRP structures also do not bind divalent metal cations in a conformation expected for the active holoenzyme. The position of the first β-strand of the palm domain (residues 228–234 in PV and 221–227 in HCV) is similar to the slightly displaced position of the corresponding β-strand (245) in the open copy B of the RHDV polymerase. As discussed above, this slightly displaced position prevents Asp-250 in the RHDV enzyme (corresponding to Asp-233 in PV and Asp-226 in HCV) from coordinating to the same metal cation as Asp-354 (corresponding to Asp-328 in PV and Asp-324 in HCV), which is presumably required for catalysis to occur. Thus, copy B of the RHDV enzyme, as well as the apoenzyme structures of PV and HCV RdRPs, may represent an open state that does not contain the metal binding configuration expected for catalyzing the addition of a nucleotide to a nucleic acid primer. The repeated observation of an open conformation in three structures of apo forms of RdRPs suggests these enzymes may prefer to adopt a catalytically inactive “ground state,” which can be activated to a catalytically competent state by the binding of a nucleic acid primer and template, divalent metal cations, and nucleotide triphosphate. The presence of open and closed conformational states in DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, as well as reverse transcriptases, has been documented previously using crystallography (13Doublie S. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Structure. 1999; 7: R31-R35Google Scholar), limited proteolysis (33Dzantiev L. Alekseyev Y.O. Morales J.C. Kool E.T. Romano L.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3215-3221Google Scholar), and electron spin resonance (34Kensch O. Restle T. Wöhrl B.M. Goody R.S. Steinhoff H.-J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 301: 1029-1039Google Scholar). Additional conformational changes involving small rotations of the thumb and finger domains may be required for the formation of an active ternary complex that would include nucleotide triphosphate and the RNA primer-template duplex. Slight steric clashes occur with the fingers and N-terminal domains when the primer-template duplexes from other polymerase·DNA complexes are docked into RHDV RdRP. Also, the thumb domain may be expected to close down onto the primer-template duplex to a greater extent than that seen even in copy A of the apo-polymerase crystal structure. Experimental structure determination of the RHDV RdRP complex with nucleotide triphosphate and an RNA primer-template duplex will yield detailed information on the conformational changes that accompany different steps of the enzymatic cycle. This information will be of great utility in the design of specific enzyme inhibitors as antiviral drugs. For example, non-nucleoside HIV-RT inhibitors that stabilize the polymerase in an inactive conformation are now routinely used to treat AIDS (35Moyle G. Drugs. 2001; 61: 19-26Google Scholar).

We have recently shown that ibudilast, which has been used for bronchial asthma and cerebrovascular disorders, attenuated the H2O2-induced apoptosis of astrocytes via the cGMP signaling pathway. This study examines the mechanism underlying the protective effect of cGMP. The membrane-permeable cGMP analog dibutyryl-cGMP attenuated the H2O2-induced decrease in cell viability, DNA ladder formation, nuclear condensation, reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and caspase-3 activation in cultured astrocytes. These effects of dibutyryl-cGMP were almost completely inhibited by the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) inhibitor KT5823. In isolated rat brain mitochondria, cGMP in the presence of cytosolic extract from astrocytes inhibited the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) as determined by monitoring Ca2+-induced mitochondrial swelling. This ability of the cytosolic extract was inactivated by heat treatment and was mimicked by exogenous PKG. The effect of cGMP on the mitochondrial swelling was blocked by KT5823. The PTP inhibitors cyclosporin A and bongkrekic acid prevented the H2O2-induced decrease in cell viability and caspase-3 activation. These findings demonstrate that cGMP inhibits the mitochondrial PTP via the activation of PKG, and the prevention of mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to its anti-apoptotic effect.

This injury is considered to be an in vitro model of ischemia/reperfusion injury because a similar paradoxical change in extracellular Ca2+ concentration is reported in ischemic brain tissue (4Siemkowicz E.

We (11Takuma K. Lee E. Enomoto R. Mori K. Baba A. Matsuda T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) found that ibudilast, which has been clinically used for bronchial asthma and cerebrovascular disorders, inhibited the H2O2-induced cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation in a cGMP-dependent mechanism. It is not known whether cGMP acts on the mitochondrial PTP. In this study, we examined the effects of cGMP on mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in astrocytic apoptosis, and on mitochondrial PTP in isolated brain mitochondria. The present study demonstrates that dibutyryl-cGMP prevents the H2O2-induced reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and caspase activation. In addition, we demonstrate in isolated rat brain mitochondria that cGMP inhibits the mitochondrial PTP in a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG)-mediated mechanism as determined by monitoring Ca2+-induced mitochondrial swelling.

Astrocytes were isolated from the cerebral cortices of 1-day-old Wistar rats as reported previously (21Takuma K. Matsuda T. Hashimoto H. Asano S. Baba A. Glia. 1994; 12: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Takuma K. Matsuda T. Asano S. Baba A. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1536-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 23Takuma K.

Cells were plated in 75-ml tissue culture flasks, split once upon confluence, and plated in 24-well (for MTT assay) and 96-well (for mitochondria energization and caspase assays) plastic tissue culture plates, 60-mm (for DNA ladder) and 100-mm (for cytochromec release analysis and cell extract preparation) plastic tissue culture dishes, and 4-well chamber slides (for fluorescence microscopy). The second cultures were grown for 14–20 days in all experiments. The cells were routinely >95% positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein, and ∼2% of the cells showed microglia based on positive isolectin B4 staining. Reperfusion experiments were carried out as reported previously (9Takuma K. Fujita T. Kimura Y. Tanabe M. Yamamuro A. Lee E. Mori K. Koyama Y. Baba A. Matsuda T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 399: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 10Takuma K. Yoshida T. Lee E. Mori K. Kishi T. Baba A. Matsuda T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 406: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cells were exposed to H2O2-containing Earle’s solution (100 μm) for 30 min and then incubated with normal Earle’s solution for the indicated times. MTT reduction activity was measured by a colorimetric assay as reported previously (1Matsuda T. Takuma K. Nishiguchi E. Hashimoto H. Azuma J. Baba A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 951-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 3Takuma K. Lee E. Kidawara M. Mori K. Kimura Y. Baba A. Matsuda T. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 4204-4212Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). MTT reduction activity is expressed as a percentage of control. DNA was extracted and subjected to 1.8% agarose gel electrophoresis as reported previously (9Takuma K. Fujita T. Kimura Y. Tanabe M. Yamamuro A. Lee E. Mori K. Koyama Y. Baba A. Matsuda T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 399: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 10Takuma K. Yoshida T. Lee E. Mori K. Kishi T. Baba A. Matsuda T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 406: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). DNA in the gel was stained with ethidium bromide and photographed with a Polaroid (type 667) under UV light. To observe individual nuclei, the cells plated on a chamber slide were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stained with Hoechst 33342 as reported previously (3Takuma K. Lee E. Kidawara M. Mori K. Kimura Y. Baba A. Matsuda T. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 4204-4212Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Takuma K. Yoshida T. Lee E. Mori K. Kishi T. Baba A. Matsuda T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 406: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). An Olympus IX70 inverted fluorescence microscope was equipped with a cooled CCD camera system (Roper Scientific, Photometrics CoolSNAP) to scan the staining nuclear images. Mitochondria energization was determined as the retention of the mitochondria-specific dye DiOC6(3) (24Pastorino J.G. Chen S.T. Tafani M. Snyder J.W. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7770-7775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Cells were loaded with 100 nm DiOC6(3) during the last 30 min of treatment. After removing the medium, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed by the addition of 100 μl of deionized water. The concentration of retained DiOC6(3) was measured with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 510 nm using a Wallac Multilabel counter. Cytosol and membrane fractions were prepared as reported previously (11Takuma K. Lee E. Enomoto R. Mori K. Baba A. Matsuda T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The protein contents of the cytosol and membrane fractions were determined by a Bio-Rad DC protein assay, and 15 μg of the sample was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% polyacrylamide). A cytochrome c antibody (1:1000) was used for immunoblotting. The activity of caspase-3-like protease in cell lysates was measured using the synthetic substrate Ac-DEVD-MCA (11Takuma K. Lee E. Enomoto R. Mori K. Baba A. Matsuda T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). After reacting for 1 h at 37 °C, the released 7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin levels were measured with excitation at 355 nm and emission at 460 nm using a Wallac Multilabel counter. The cytosol extracts were prepared as follows. Cells plated on 100-mm dishes were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off using a policeman, and collected by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (320 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-base, pH 7.4) and disrupted with 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant (∼10 mg of protein/ml) was kept at −80 °C. Brain mitochondria were isolated from male Wistar rats (120–140 g) by the method of Sims (25Sims N.R. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1836-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) using a discontinuous Percoll gradient centrifugation. The mitochondrial fraction was resuspended in buffer containing sucrose (320 mm) and Tris-base (10 mm, pH 7.4) and kept on ice until use. The opening of the PTP causes mitochondrial swelling that is conveniently assayed as a decrease in the light scattering (and thus absorbance) of a mitochondrial suspension. The Ca2+-induced mitochondrial swelling was assayed essentially as described by Friberg et al. (26Friberg H. Ferrand-Drake M. Bengtsson F. Halestrap A.P. Wieloch T. J Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5151-5159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rotenone, antimycin, and A23187 were added 5 min before the addition of CaCl2solution to ensure the complete equilibration of calcium ions across the mitochondrial membrane under de-energized conditions. The treatment of the mitochondrial suspension (0.5 mg/ml) with cGMP, the cytosolic extract, or PKG was carried out for 15 min before the addition of CaCl2 solution. The calcium ion concentrations were calculated from the nitrilotriacetic acid buffering (27Connern C.P. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Absorbance at 540 nm was measured using a Shimadzu UV1200 spectrophotometer (Kyoto, Japan). Each experiment shown is representative of at least three similar experiments performed on separate mitochondrial preparations. Statistical analysis of the experimental data was carried out by Student-Newman-Keuls test, Dunnett's t test, or Tukey HSD test using a software package (Stat View 5.0) for Apple Macintosh. Reperfusion after exposure of astrocytes to H2O2-containing medium causes a decrease in MTT reduction activity, DNA ladder formation, cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and caspase-3 like protease activation (3Takuma K. Lee E. Kidawara M. Mori K. Kimura Y. Baba A. Matsuda T. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 4204-4212Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the effects of membrane-permeable cGMP analogs on the H2O2-induced apoptosis. Dibutyryl-cGMP, 8-pCPT-cGMP, and Sp-8-pCPT-cGMPS attenuated significantly the H2O2-induced decrease in MTT reduction activity in a dose-dependent manner; the effect of Sp-8-pCPT-cGMPS was more potent than that of dibutyryl-cGMP and 8-pCPT-cGMP. The protective effect of dibutyryl-cGMP was observed even in the presence of the ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059 and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (data not shown). Dibutyryl-cGMP also attenuated the H2O2-induced DNA ladder formation (Fig.2 A) and nuclear condensation (Fig. 2 B). Reperfusion after the exposure of astrocytes to H2O2 also caused a decrease in DiOC6(3) retention, which reflects mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 3 A). The H2O2-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was inhibited by dibutyryl-cGMP in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, dibutyryl-cGMP attenuated the H2O2-induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria and caspase-3-like protease activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4).Figure 2Effect of dibutyryl-cGMP on apoptosis-like cell injury induced by H2O2exposure/reperfusion in cultured rat astrocytes.

KT5823 also blocked the effect of dibutyryl-cGMP on mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig.5 B), cytochrome c release (Fig. 5 C), and caspase-3-like protease activation (Fig. 5 D). A pilot experiment showed that exposure of purified rat brain mitochondria to 30–100 μm Ca2+ caused a significant decrease in absorbance, indicating mitochondrial swelling by the PTP opening (data not shown). The swelling was dependent on Ca2+ concentration as reported previously (26Friberg H. Ferrand-Drake M. Bengtsson F. Halestrap A.P. Wieloch T. J Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5151-5159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we used 100 μm Ca2+ to induce mitochondrial swelling. The swelling was inhibited by the mitochondrial PTP inhibitors cyclosporin A (28Broekemeier K.M. Dempsey M.E. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7826-7830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and bongkrekic acid (29Zoratti M. Szabò I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar) (Fig.6 A). Neither cGMP nor cytosolic extract from astrocytes affected the Ca2+-induced mitochondrial swelling, but the simultaneous addition of cGMP and the cytosolic extract prevented the swelling in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6, B and C). The effect of cGMP plus the cytosolic extract was also observed in the swelling induced by 30 μmCa2+ (data not shown). The ability of the cytosolic extract was inactivated by heat-treating it (Fig.7 A) and was mimicked by exogenous PKG (Fig. 7 B). The similar protection by cGMP against Ca2+-induced swelling was observed even when cGMP was added together with or after Ca2+ (data not shown). KT5823 antagonized the effect of cGMP plus the cytosolic extract (Fig. 7 C) or PKG (Fig. 7 B) in inhibiting the Ca2+-induced swelling. The mitochondrial PTP inhibitors cyclosporin A and bongkrekic acid inhibited the H2O2-induced decrease in MTT reduction activity and activation of caspase-3-like protease in cultured astrocytes (Fig.8). In this experiment, bongkrekic acid was used at a relatively low concentration because at 50 μm, it showed cell toxicity (data not shown).Figure 7Involvement of protein kinase G on the inhibition by cGMP and cytosolic extract from astrocytes on Ca2+-induced swelling in purified rat brain mitochondria.

The membrane-permeable cGMP analogs dibutyryl-cGMP, 8-pCPT-cGMP, and Sp-8-pCPT-cGMPS attenuated the H2O2-induced decrease in cell viability. In view of the importance of mitochondria in the apoptotic process, the present study focused on the effect of cGMP on the H2O2-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. We showed that dibutyryl-cGMP prevented the reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release and consequently abolished caspase-3 activation, nuclear condensation, and DNA fragmentation in cultured astrocytes. These findings suggest that cGMP inhibits the H2O2-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and prevents astrocyte apoptosis. The inhibitory effect of cGMP analog on caspase-3 activation and cytochrome c release was also observed in hepatocytes (17Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol.

Li J. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6740-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many of the cellular effects of cGMP are mediated by PKG. In this respect, Kimet al. (19Kim Y.M. Chung H.T. Kim S.S. Han J.A. Yoo Y.M. Kim K.M. Lee G.H. Yun H.Y. Green A. Li J. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6740-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the PKG inhibitor KT5823 reversed the 8-bromo-cGMP-mediated prevention of cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation in PC12 cells. We also found that KT5823 almost completely blocked the protection provided by dibutyryl-cGMP against the H2O2-induced reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and caspse-3 activation in astrocytes. These findings suggest that cGMP analogs prevent astrocyte apoptosis via the activation of PKG, although the exact mechanism by which cGMP/PKG prevents apoptotic events is not known. Li et al. (18Li J. Yang S. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13026-13034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) reported that cAMP as well as cGMP analogs suppressed tumor necrosis factor-α plus actinomycin D-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes. However, it is unlikely that cAMP signaling also plays a role in the prevention of astrocyte apoptosis because cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors do not protect astrocytes against the H2O2-induced cytotoxicity (11Takuma K. Lee E. Enomoto R. Mori K. Baba A. Matsuda T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we reported that the ERK signal plays a role in the protective effect of T-588 and NGF against H2O2-induced astrocyte apoptosis (9Takuma K. Fujita T. Kimura Y. Tanabe M. Yamamuro A. Lee E. Mori K. Koyama Y. Baba A. Matsuda T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 399: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In view of the recent studies that cGMP activates ERK (30Silberbach M. Gorenc T. Hershberger R.E. Stork P.J. Steyger P.S. Roberts C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24858-24864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31Komalavilas P. Shah P.K. Jo H. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11389-11396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), it was considered whether the effect of cGMP reported here may be mediated by the activation of ERK or phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase. However, the protective effect of dibutyryl-cGMP was observed even in the presence of the ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059 and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. Activation of the mitochondrial PTP has been identified as a possible common effector of the cell death of numerous cell types in response to both necrotic and apoptotic stimuli (33Lemasters J.J. Nieminen A.L. Qian T. Trost L.C. Herman B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 174: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 34Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche-Rigon M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 619-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that the anti-apoptotic effect of cGMP may be mediated by the inhibition of the mitochondrial PTP; however there are no reports on the effect of cGMP on the PTP. We demonstrate here that cGMP together with PKG, as well as cyclosporin A and bongkrekic acid, inhibit the Ca2+-induced mitochondrial swelling in isolated brain mitochondria. The effect of cGMP is dose-dependent and observed even at 1 μm, suggesting that cGMP is an endogenous potent inhibitor of the PTP. The effect of cGMP on the mitochondrial PTP required the presence of the cytosolic extract, and the ability of the cytosolic extract was inactivated by heat treatment. Furthermore, the effect of cGMP plus the cytosolic extract was antagonized by KT5823, and exogenous PKG mimicked the effect of the cytosolic extract. Taken together, it is likely that cGMP inhibits the mitochondrial PTP via the activation of PKG. The mitochondrial PTP is formed from a complex of the voltage-dependent anion channel, the adenine nucleotide translocase, and cyclophilin-D at contact sites between the mitochondrial outer and inner membranes. It is regulated by numerous endogenous physiological effectors such as ions, protons, the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, the concentration of adenine nucleotides, the pyrimidine redox state, the thiol redox state, reactive oxygen species, and Bcl-2 family proteins (34Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche-Rigon M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 619-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). Genaroet al. (12Genaro A.M. Hortelano S. Alvarez A. Martinez C. Bosca L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1884-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) reported that an induction of Bcl-2 is involved in the anti-apoptotic effect of cGMP in splenocytes. In contrast, the effect of cGMP was observed even when it was added together with or after Ca2+. In view of the rapid effect of cGMP, it is unlikely that these endogenous effectors may be involved in the effect of cGMP on the mitochondrial PTP. The present study using a cell-free system suggests that cGMP interacts directly with mitochondria, resulting in the inhibition of the mitochondrial PTP via the activation of PKG. It is not known how cGMP/PKG signaling affects the mitochondrial PTP. Known substrates for PKG include inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (35Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 469-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein (36Tsou K. Snyder G.L. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3462-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and cGMP-binding phosphodiesterase (37Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol.

However, the role of these substrates in the inhibition by cGMP of the mitochondrial PTP is not clear. There are a limited number of inhibitors of the mitochondrial PTP. The most specific inhibitor is cyclosporin A, which competitively prevents cyclophilin from interacting with specific cyclophilin-dependent binding domains of the pore. Other classes of inhibitors of the mitochondrial PTP consist of the adenine nucleotide translocase ligand bongkrekic acid (29Zoratti M. Szabò I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar), the phospholipase inhibitor trifluoperazine (39Nieminen A.L. Saylor A.K. Tesfai S.A. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Biochem.

Commun. 2000; 276: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we found that the PTP inhibitors cyclosporin A and bongkrekic acid prevented the H2O2-induced reduction in cell viability and caspase-3 activation in astrocytes. In view of the evidence implicating the mitochondrial PTP in ischemia-related tissue damage, it has become important to identify strategies to inhibit the induction of the PTP opening. The present study demonstrates that cGMP inhibits the mitochondrial PTP opening, resulting in apoptotic events via the activation of PKG. This suggests that cGMP/PKG signaling is a novel target for the prevention of mitochondrial dysfunction-mediated cell death. In line with this, we have shown that cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors including ibudilast protect astrocytes against reperfusion injury via cGMP/PKG signaling (11Takuma K. Lee E. Enomoto R. Mori K.

For this, bacteria have to monitor their own population size. This can be achieved by means of autoinduction. Cell-cell communication using N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL)1 signals is one of the few known mechanisms through which bacteria can communicate with each other and is a widespread phenomenon in Gram-negative bacteria (1Fuqua C. Winans S.C. Greenberg E.P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 727-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 2Swift S. Williams P. Stewart G.S.A.B. Cell Cell Signaling in Bacteria.. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1999: 291-313Google Scholar), including plant-associated bacteria (3Shaw P.D. Ping G. Daly S.L. Cha C. Cronan J.E. Rinehart K.L. Farrand S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

AHLs mainly vary with respect to the length (4–14 carbons) and the substituent (H, O, or OH) at the third carbon of the acyl side chain. The AHL signal is released into the environment, either by passive diffusion, as observed for 3O-C6-HSL in Vibrio fischeri andEscherichia coli cells (5Kaplan H.B. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1210-1214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by a combination of diffusion and active efflux in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6Pearson J.P. Van Delden C. Iglewski B.H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and accumulates with growth of the bacterial population. At least inV. fischeri, the signal freely diffuses back into the cells such that its intracellular concentration also rises as a function of the increase in bacterial population. Transduction of this information to response regulators of gene expression leads to the elaboration of an appropriate phenotype at high cell densities. Using the Agrobacterium tumefaciens tra reporter system to detect autoinducer molecules, members of the genus Rhizobiumshowed the greatest diversity, with some producing as few as one and others producing as many as seven detectable signals (7Cha C.

InRhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae, thecin locus encodes a master regulatory system. Mutation ofcinIR abolishes the production ofN-(3R)-hydroxy-7-cis-tetradecenoyl-l-homoserine lactone (3OH-C14:1-HSL), also termed “small”, and reduces the synthesis of AHLs produced by the enzymes encoded byraiI, traI-like, or rhiI (8Lithgow J.K.

Rhizobium etli CNPAF512, a nitrogen-fixing symbiont ofPhaseolus vulgaris, produces at least seven different autoinducer molecules (12Rosemeyer V. Michiels J. Verreth C. Vanderleyden J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 815-821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rosemeyer et al. (12Rosemeyer V. Michiels J. Verreth C. Vanderleyden J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 815-821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified the raiIR quorum-sensing system in R. etli. Examination of different rai mutants for nodulation of beans showed that raiI is involved in the restriction of nodule number, whereas nitrogen-fixing activity per nodule is not affected. The culture supernatant of a raiI mutant revealed only three different autoinducer molecules. One of them induces a growth-inhibitory effect on R. leguminosarum bv.viciae 248, similar to the low molecular weight bacteriocin “small”, which is common in fast-growing rhizobia. The properties, growth inhibition, and autoinducer activity, are features reported for 3OH-C14:1-HSL, produced by R. leguminosarum bv.viciae (13Schripsema J. de Rudder K.E. van Vliet T.B.

Here we report on the cin locus, the second quorum-sensing system in R. etli CNPAF512 that is expressed under both free-living and symbiotic conditions and is involved in the production of a 3OH-(slc)-HSL (slc, saturated long chain). Despite high sequence conservation, the cin locus of R. etli andR. leguminosarum bv. viciae appear to control different functions. Mutational analysis of R. etli revealed that the cin system regulates growth and fulfills a key role in bacteroid differentiation and nitrogen fixation.

To study bacterial growth over a long period of time, overnight cultures of the strains were diluted in 10 mm MgSO4 to an absorbance at 595 nm (A595) of 0.3 (dilution ∼10-fold). Subsequently, these cultures were diluted 10-fold after which 295 μl of growth medium was inoculated with 5 μl of bacterial suspension (total dilution ∼6000-fold). Bacteria were grown, and the absorbance was measured automatically each 30 min during at least 6 days in a BioscreenC (Labsystems Oy). For each time point, the average optical density was calculated from five independent measurements. Phaseolus vulgaris cv. Limburgse vroege seedlings were planted in Snoeck medium, which is optimized for in vitro growth of common bean. 2C. Snoeck, unpublished data. Plants were inoculated and grown essentially as described by Michiels et al. (17Michiels J. Moris M. Dombrecht B. Verreth C. Vanderleyden J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3620-3628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acetylene reduction activity was determined 3 weeks after inoculation. For expression analysis during symbiosis, bacteroids were purified from plant material by differential centrifugation (17Michiels J. Moris M. Dombrecht B. Verreth C. Vanderleyden J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3620-3628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protocol was slightly adapted for the extraction of bacteroid autoinducers. Nodules from 1–2 plants (± 1.5 g) were collected in a Falcon tube (15 ml) containing 0.2 g of polyvinyl polypyrolidone, and magnesium phosphate buffer was added to a final volume of 6 ml and subsequently crushed. Next, the plant material was removed by differential centrifugation. To lyse the bacteria, the suspension was supplemented with SDS (final concentration, 1%) and proteinase K (final concentration, 100 μg/ml) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 6000 rpm after which the cell-free supernatant was immediately extracted to isolate the autoinducers. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of β-glucuronidase (GusA) activity was performed as described elsewhere (17Michiels J. Moris M. Dombrecht B. Verreth C. Vanderleyden J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3620-3628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Vande Broek A. Vanderleyden J. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1995; 8: 800-810Crossref Google Scholar). For transmission electron microscopic analysis (TEM), thin sections of 3-week-old nodules were prepared as described by Xi et al. (19Xi C. Schoeters E. Vanderleyden J. Michiels J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11114-11119Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and analyzed in a Zeiss EM 900 electron microscope. Rhizobium strains and A. tumefaciens transformants were tested for activation of theA. tumefaciens tra reporter system and for bacteriostatic activity toward the sensitive strain R. leguminosarum bv.viciae 248 as described by Schripsema et al. (13Schripsema J. de Rudder K.E. van Vliet T.B. Lankhorst P.P. de Vroom E. Kijne J.W. van Brussel A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 366-371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To extract autoinducers, strains were first grown to the stationary phase. Cell-free supernatant from either a free-living liquid culture or from symbiotic bacteroids (see above) was extracted, and the autoinducers were detected on TLC by the trareporter system as described by Rosemeyer et al. (12Rosemeyer V. Michiels J. Verreth C. Vanderleyden J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 815-821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ethyl acetate extracts from 10 liters of stationary phase cultures of FAJ4010 were reconstituted in 50% acetonitrile in water and subjected to solid-phase extraction using Waters OASIS HLB cartridges. Fractions were eluted with an increasing concentration of methanol in water (50–100%, v/v). Positive fractions on the A. tumefaciens tra reporter and R. leguminosarum bv. viciae248 growth inhibition assays were collected, dried, and redissolved in 50% acetonitrile in water and applied to a C18 Phenomenex Bondclone HPLC column. Fractions were eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in water (40–100%, v/v) over a 30-min period at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and monitored at 200 nm. Positive fractions were re-chromatographed using an isocratic mobile phase (50% acetonitrile in water; 1 ml/min), and the active subfraction was analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. Standard techniques were used for DNA manipulations (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA probes for Southern hybridization were labeled with digoxigenin. An ordered series of sequencing clones was obtained via restriction enzyme mapping of pFAJ4003 and ExoIII deletion procedures (Erase-A-Base® Promega). Nucleotide sequencing ofcinR, cinI, and the flanking regions was accomplished by using the A.L.F. sequencer (Amersham Biosciences). The 5.3-kb EcoRI fragment from pFAJ4000 containing cinR, cinI, orf123, andorf140 was first cloned into pBluescriptIIKs+yielding pFAJ4003. A PstI-EcoRI fragment of pFAJ4003, lacking the 5′-end of orf140, wasEcoRI-PstI subcloned in the broad host range vector pLAFR3 (pFAJ4012; Fig. 1). Furthermore, pFAJ4013 was made by insertion of the 5.3-kb EcoRI fragment from pFAJ4003 in pPZP200, in which part of the multiple cloning site betweenXhoI and PacI was deleted. A fragment containing cinR and cinI was amplified via PCR using primers Rhi15 (5′-ATGGGAATTCATCCAGTGCCGAGGAGATAC-3′) and Rhi16 (5′-TAGAGGATCCTCGGCATCATCATCACCTCG-3′) and pFAJ4003 as template DNA. The resulting 3-kb fragment was digested with EcoRI andBamHI and cloned in pUCNotI-ΔS (pUCNotI derivative lacking the SphI recognition site via restriction digest and blunt ligation) yielding plasmid pFAJ4004 (Fig. 1). The 2.2-kbBamHI fragment from pHP45Ω-Km containing a Kmrcassette was ligated into the unique SphI site ofcinI in pFAJ4004 after blunting of the fragments. ThecinRcinI::Km locus was further cloned into thesacB suicide vector pJQ200uc1 as a 5.2-kb NotI fragment to obtain pFAJ4006. The non-polar cinR point mutation and an additional frameshift were introduced via the QuickChange™ site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) using primers Rhi32 (5′-CTATGCCATGCTGGTACCATGCCCAGAAGCACG-3′) and Rhi33 (5′-CGTGCTTCTGGGCATGGTACCAGCATGGCATAG-3′) on pFAJ4004. As a result of the mutation, a new and unique KpnI site (GGTACC; mutations are shown in bold: insertion of A; substitution G with C) was created in cinR. Subsequently, the 3-kb NotI fragment containing the mutatedcinR gene was inserted into pJQ200uc1 creating pFAJ4007. ThecinR::Sp mutation was made by introducing the 2-kb spectinomycin resistance cartridge from pHP45Ω into the uniqueKpnI site within cinR of pFAJ4007 after blunting of the fragments, resulting in pFAJ4009. The plasmids pFAJ4006, pFAJ4007, and pFAJ4009 were introduced into R. etliCNPAF512, and double recombinants were selected as described previously (12Rosemeyer V. Michiels J. Verreth C. Vanderleyden J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 815-821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) creating a cinI mutant (FAJ4006) and twocinR mutants (FAJ4007, FAJ4009; Fig. 1). A cartridge containing the promoterless gusA gene and a spectinomycin resistance gene from pWM5 was removed with SmaI and ligated into the XhoI site of pFAJ1327 (containing raiI,raiR, and orf1) after blunting of the vector, yielding plasmid pFAJ4010. For the construction of a R. etli raiI mutant strain, pFAJ4010 was introduced into the R. etli CNPAF512 wild-type strain, yielding FAJ4010. Tri-parental conjugation of pFAJ4006 (cinI::Km) into FAJ4010 resulted in the raiI::SpcinI::Km double mutant FAJ4013. Plasmid-bornePcinR-gusA andPcinI-gusA fusions were constructed in the promoter probe vector pFAJ1703 (20Dombrecht B. Vanderleyden J. Michiels J. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2001; 14: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The cinRpromoter region was amplified by PCR with FAJ1337 as a template using primers Rhi15 and Tn5-B (5′-GGTTCCGTTCAGGACGCTAC-3′). The resulting 1.2-kb fragment was cloned into the HpaI site of pFAJ1703 after blunting of the fragments, yielding plasmid pFAJ4011. To construct pFAJ4014 (cinI-gusA fusion carrying a mutant cinR gene region), the 1.8-kbEcoRI-SphI fragment of pFAJ4007 was blunt-end ligated into the HpaI site of pFAJ1703. pFAJ4015 is aKpnI deletion derivative of thecinI-gusA fusion pFAJ4014 (Fig. 1). A Tn5-induced mutant library of R. etli CNPAF512 was screened using the growth inhibition assay (13Schripsema J. de Rudder K.E. van Vliet T.B. Lankhorst P.P. de Vroom E. Kijne J.W. van Brussel A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 366-371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant FAJ1337 no longer inhibited growth of R. leguminosarum bv.viciae 248. By means of inverse PCR onEcoRI-digested genomic DNA of FAJ1337 with transposon-specific primers, ∼10 kb of the transposon flanking DNA of FAJ1337 was amplified and cloned. Subsequently, PstI fragments of the amplified DNA were subcloned into pUC18 and tested for autoinducer production in E. coli using the trasystem of A. tumefaciens as a reporter (7Cha C. Gao P. Chen Y.C. Shaw P.D. Farrand S.K. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1998; 11: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). One positive clone was obtained, and the corresponding 7.5-kb PstI fragment, carrying part of the cloning vector, was subsequently used as a probe in a Southern hybridization of a R. etli CNPAF512 genomic library, constructed in pLAFR1 (21D'hooghe I. Michiels J. Vlassak K. Verreth C. Waelkens F. Vanderleyden J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A 5.3-kb EcoRI fragment from clone pFAJ4000 was found to give a positive hybridization signal. FAJ1337 was complemented for growth inhibition of the sensitive strain R. leguminosarum bv. viciae 248 by both pFAJ4000 and pFAJ4012 (Fig. 1). DNA sequence analysis of the cloned 5.3-kb EcoRI fragment revealed five complete open reading frames (ORFs) as illustrated in Fig. 1. The ORFs were identified and the start codon was assigned on the basis of the GC content (22Bibb M.J. Findlay P.R. Johnson M.W. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 30: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), the preferential codon usage (searchcutg, GCG-package Wisconsin), and similarity with known genes. One ORF (726 bp) codes for a putative protein of 241 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 27.3 kDa. The putative protein is similar to several LuxR-type transcriptional activators such as CinR (96% amino acid identity) of R. leguminosarum bv.viciae (AAF89989), CerR (30% identity) of Rhodobacter sphaeroides (AAC46021) and RaiR (31% identity) of R. etli (AAC38173). Because of the high amino acid identity of theR. etli putative protein with CinR, it was given the same name. Alignment of R. etli CinR with E. coli NarL (23Baikalov I. Schroder I. Kaczor-Grzeskowiak M. Grzeskowiak K. Gunsalus R.P. Dickerson R.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11053-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), designates a helix-turn-helix motif between residues 196 and 220.In silico analysis of the cinR non-coding region revealed a putative terminator (nucleotides 2615–2650, ΔG = −26.3). PCR analysis with a Tn5-specific primer combined with primers within the coding sequence of cinR or cinI (see below) indicated that the transposon in FAJ1337 is inserted between nucleotides 423 and 424 of cinR. A second ORF of 666 bp, which is unidirectional with cinR, is found 224-bp downstream of cinR. While the deduced amino acid sequence is most related to CinI (95% identity) of R. leguminosarum bv. viciae (AAF89990), it is also similar to CerI (33% identity) of R. sphaeroides (AAC46022) and RaiI of R. etli (39% identity) (AAC38172). The putative protein with a calculated molecular mass of 25.0 kDa was named CinI. CinI contains 10 invariant amino acids typical for the LuxI family of autoinducer synthases (24Parsek M.R. Schaefer A.L. Greenberg E.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) of which seven (R24, E43, D45, D48, R70, E101, R104; numbered with respect to R. etli CinI) may take part in the S-adenosyl-methionine binding site (25Fuqua C. Greenberg E.P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In the intergenic region between cinI and ORF123 (see below), two putative terminators (nucleotides 3520–3576, ΔG = −23.8; nucleotide 3694–3735, ΔG = −32.4) were found. Immediately downstream of cinI, a short ORF123 (368 bp), located on the opposite strand, encodes a putative response regulator of the CheY family with 94% identity to the CheY like protein ofR. leguminosarum bv. viciae (AAF89991), 40% identity to a probable response regulator of Mesorhizobium loti (BAB49462) and 35% identity to the FixL receiver domain ofR. etli (AAG00949). The R. etli response regulator encoded by ORF123 contains the conserved residues D14, D58, T86 en K106 (numbered with respect to ORF123), which are part of the essential active site of CheY (26Volz K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11741-11753Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) in which D58 can be phosphorylated. ORF140 (420 bp) is located upstream of cinR and codes for a protein similar to a hypothetical protein (AAG2039) ofHalobacterium sp. NRC-1 (51% identity), and an unknown protein of Bacillus subtilis (CAB11811) (39% identity). Upstream of ORF123, a Met-tRNA gene (74 bp) (tRNAscan-S.E. v. 1.11) is found with the anticodon (CAT) located between nucleotides 4364 and 4366 of the 5.3-kb EcoRI fragment. This gene shows perfect (100%) DNA sequence identity to the Met-tRNA gene of R. leguminosarum bv. viciae (AF210630) and a M. loti sequence (AP002999) and is similar to a Rhizobiumsp. NGR234 sequence (AE000079) (91% identity). Analysis of the intergenic region between ORF123 and the Met-tRNA gene indicates the presence of a putative terminator sequence downstream of the tRNA gene (nucleotides 5002–5068, ΔG = −22.9). An NMR analysis of the compound produced by R. etli CinI was conducted. As a control, 3OH-C14:1-HSL was synthesized (data not shown) and analyzed. The NMR data of the synthetic compound are in agreement with previously recorded data (13Schripsema J. de Rudder K.E. van Vliet T.B. Lankhorst P.P. de Vroom E. Kijne J.W. van Brussel A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 366-371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 1H NMR spectrum of the R. etli compound contains all characteristic signals of a 3-hydroxyacyl-homoserine lactone. Evidence for the homoserine lactone moiety is constituted by the signal at 6.33–6.24 ppm (amide NH) and the characteristic butyrolactone signals at 4.52, 4.47, 4.27, 2.77, and 2.10 ppm. The line shapes and splitting patterns are in good agreement with those of synthetic acyl-homoserine lactones. Moreover, the line at 3.98 ppm is similar to the CH(OH) resonance in 3OH-C14:1-HSL. However, the characteristic double bond signals between 5 and 6 ppm observed for 3OH-C14:1-HSL, as well as the signals around 2.00 ppm of the protons on adjacent carbon atoms are absent. On the basis of its chromatographic properties (TLC, HPLC), the R. etli HSL is likely to possess a long chain fatty acid group. This allows to tentatively assign the spectrum of the R. etli autoinducer produced by CinI to a saturated long chain 3-hydroxy-acyl-homoserine lactone, which is clearly different from the structure of R. leguminosarum 3OH-C14:1-HSL. In the subsequent part we will refer to the R. etli autoinducer as 3OH-(slc)-HSL. To study the cell density-dependent expression of the cin locus,cinR-gusA (pFAJ4011) andcinI-gusA (pFAJ4014) fusions were constructed. The cinR gene in pFAJ4014 was inactivated by site-directed mutagenesis. To determine whether a promoter is present in thecinR-cinI intergenic region, a secondcinI-gusA (pFAJ4015) fusion, containing a 632-bp upstream region of cinI (Fig. 1), was also constructed. As shown in Fig. 2A,cinI expression from pFAJ4014 under free-living conditions in a wild-type background increased with the cell density and reached a plateau (1500–2400 units) as the culture entered into the stationary phase. cinI expression from pFAJ4015 displayed a similar cell density-dependent pattern of expression (Fig.2B). However, two differences between the two fusions can be noticed. Firstly, induction of cinI expression from pFAJ4015 starts at a lower absorbance compared with pFAJ4014. Secondly, the maximum expression level of cinI from pFAJ4015 is approximately 4-fold higher, compared with that of pFAJ4014. None of the cinI-gusA fusions are expressed in cinR orcinI mutant backgrounds (Fig. 2, A andB), demonstrating that transcription of cinIrequires both CinI and CinR. A threshold cell density (approximately A595 = 0.6) seems to be required to observe a very low cinRexpression in wild-type and cinR or cinI mutant backgrounds (Fig. 2C). Although expression ofcinR remains low, it reaches a maximum (∼20 units) as soon as cells enter the stationary phase. The observation that bothcinR and cinI expression is maximal during the same stage of growth is in agreement with a role of CinR in the regulation of cinI expression. The observation that cinI is expressed in either the presence or absence of the cinR promoter region, demonstrates that cinR and cinI are likely organized into different transcriptional units. Furthermore, the overall high expression level of cinI (minimal 100-fold higher than cinR), suggests that transcription ofcinI in both pFAJ4014 and pFAJ4015 is controlled by a promoter in the cinR-cinI intergenic region. This is in agreement with the presence of a putative terminator downstream of cinR. The difference in cinI expression levels between pFAJ4014 and pFAJ4015, is likely caused by a negative regulation at the level of the putative cinI promoter. Expression of thecinI-gusA and cinR-gusAfusions was monitored in isolated bacteroids, obtained from 21-day-old bean nodules, induced by wild-type CNPAF512, the cinR(FAJ4007), and cinI mutant (FAJ4006). The presence of the plasmid-borne gusA-fusions pFAJ4011, pFAJ4014, and pFAJ4015 in the different strains did not affect their symbiotic performance (data not shown). As illustrated in Fig.3, expression of the cinRfusion (pFAJ4011) is low (∼40 units) and does not significantly differ in the three genetic backgrounds. Expression of the shortcinI fusion (pFAJ4015) is significantly higher (∼8-fold) compared with the long cinI fusion (pFAJ4014) in wild-type background, similar to what was observed under free-living conditions. However, in contrast to free-living conditions, expression of the shortcinI fusion is less dependent on the presence of CinI because cinI expression from pFAJ4015 is still observed incinI mutant (FAJ4006) bacteroids. Similarly to free-living conditions, cinI gene expression requires the presence of CinR. Finally, it should be noted that the expression level ofcinI in bacteroids is at least 10-fold lower compared with free-living conditions. Shortly after inoculation (24 h), cinI-gusAexpression (pFAJ4015) was observed on the surface of root hairs during colonization of wild-type and the cinI mutant (FAJ4006) (data not shown). Light microscopic analysis, 48 h after inoculation of the roots, localized pFAJ4015 expression in the infection tread, formed by wild-type and the FAJ4006 mutant (Fig.4, A and B). However, no cinI-gusA expression from pFAJ4015 was observed in the cinR mutant (FAJ4007) during colonization (data"

LEDGF/p75 is known to be a weak co-activator of transcription (1Ge H. Si Y. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6723-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that LECs and COS-7 cells overexpressing LEDGF activated expression of Hsp27 and αB-crystallin and enhanced resistance against oxidative and hyperthermic stress (4Singh D.P. Ohguro N. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1444-1451PubMed Google Scholar). We have also reported that heat and oxidative stress activated the expression of LEDGF in these cells. LECs, corneal epithelium, COS-7 cells, skin fibroblasts, and keratinocytes adapted and survived remarkably well when cultured in the presence of LEDGF (5Singh D.P. Ohguro N. Kikuchi T. Sueno T. Reddy V.N. Yuge K. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Retinal photoreceptor cells cultured in the presence of LEDGF survived well and expressed Hsp90 at higher levels than cells cultured without it (6Nakamura M. Singh D.P. Kubo E. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). In an in vivo Lewis rat model in which intense light induced retinal photoreceptor cell damage, the intravitreal injection of LEDGF preserved normal retinal photoreceptor cell anatomy and significantly prolonged normal function (7Machida S. Chaudhry P. Shinohara T. Singh D.P. Reddy V.K. Chylack Jr., L.T. Sieving P.A. Bush R.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1087-1095PubMed Google Scholar). LEDGF, a highly charged lysine-, arginine-, glutamic acid-, and aspartic acid-rich protein, binds to heparin and is rapidly translocated from the extracellular space into the nucleus (8Fatma N. Singh D.P. Shinohara T. Chylack Jr., L.T. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 2648-2657PubMed Google Scholar). LEDGF also binds to DNA. In a previous report (9Singh D.P. Fatma N. Kimura A. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The consensus core nucleotide sequences to which LEDGF bound were GAA and AGG. LEDGF may bind to a single core sequence or to multiple core sequences, such as nGAAnnTTCn or AGGGGA. Furthermore, our results suggest that other stress-related genes are activated by LEDGF (9Singh D.P. Fatma N. Kimura A. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

To reduce the adverse effects of ROS, cells have evolved efficient antioxidants that include enzymes (e.g. catalase), thiols (glutathione), and other substances that decompose peroxides and superoxide anions (12Stadtman E.R. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1990; 9: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Recently, several reports have emphasized the importance of antioxidant protein 2 (AOP2), a member of the thiol-specific antioxidant family of proteins in the removal of peroxides from liver, kidney, and brain (13Lim M.J. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Yu D.Y. Lee K.K. Yeom Y.I. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 216: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,14Netto L.E.S. Chae H.J. Kang S. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15315-15321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). AOP2 has a highly conserved cysteine at position 47 (15, 16). Furthermore, AOP2 protects various enzymes from inactivation by a nonenzymatic mixed function oxidation mechanism (13Lim M.J. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Yu D.Y. Lee K.K. Yeom Y.I. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 216: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AOP2 also protects DNA from cleavage by ROS. Recently, we observed that COS-7 cells, and LECs overexpressing LEDGF, expressed elevated levels of AOP2 and survived longer under oxidative and thermal stress. In an earlier study (4Singh D.P. Ohguro N. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1444-1451PubMed Google Scholar), we showed that LEDGF up-regulated the expression of Hsp27 and αB-crystallin in these same cells, so the finding of an additional, potent antioxidant protein, AOP2, prompted us to assess the role of LEDGF in activating the AOP2 gene. Ultimately, we were interested in understanding the relative importance of these stress proteins in determining survival in cells facing oxidative stress. In this series of investigations, we have identified LEDGF-responsive elements in the AOP2 gene promoter and ascertained if LEDGF exerts its protective, antioxidant effect via up-regulation of the AOP2 gene. Most molecular subcloning techniques used in these experiments are found in Sambrook et al. (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.G. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A fusion protein between LEDGF and glutathione S-transferase (GST) generated by inserting the entire coding sequence of the LEDGF cDNA into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of a pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was used to transformEscherichia coli (BL21) (4Singh D.P. Ohguro N. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1444-1451PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of the GST-LEDGF fusion protein was induced with isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's protocols. The protein concentration was determined with the Bradford method (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar). A construct containing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) and LEDGF cDNA was generated with the “living color system” (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using the plasmid vector pEGFP-C1 (GFP-vector) for eukaryotic expression. This construct was used to generate eukaryotic cells that overexpressed LEDGF (GFP-LEDGF). We also transfected the cells with the empty GFP vector as a control. We selected oligonucleotides having HSE and STRE from the sequence of the AOP2 promoter (20Phelan S.A. Johnson K.A. Beier D.R. Paigen B. Genomics. 1998; 54: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and had them synthesized commercially. We confirmed their sequence, annealed, and end-labeled them with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Inc.). The binding reaction was performed in 20 μl of binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 75 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, and 1 μg of poly(dI/dC). Five fmol (1000 cpm) of the end-labeled probe were incubated on ice for 30 min with 10–1000 ng of the GST-LEDGF fusion protein. Samples were then loaded on 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer for 2 h at 10 V/cm. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. In competition assays, 10-, 100-, and 1000-fold molar excesses of cold probe were added. For the supershift assay, 1 μl of rabbit anti-LEDGF antibody (Ab) was added to the tube containing the probe and the purified protein or nuclear extract. The mixture was incubated for an additional 30 min while the complexes formed, and then EMSA was performed. Human lens epithelial cell nuclear extract was prepared following the method of Sambrook et al. (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.G. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with certain modifications. Briefly, human LECs (1 × 10 6) were cultured in 100-mm plates. The cells were washed gently with chilled phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2). Cells were collected by centrifugation using a microcentrifuge and resuspended in 5 pellet volumes of cytoplasmic extract buffer (10 mm HEPES, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.075% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, adjusted to pH 7.6). After a short incubation on ice, the cytoplasmic extract was removed from the pellet. Following careful washing with cytoplasmic extract without detergent (Nonidet P-40), the fragile nuclei were resuspended in nuclear extract buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25% (v/v) glycerol, adjusted to pH 8.0). Salt concentration was adjusted to 400 mm using 5m NaCl, and the extract was incubated on ice for 10 min with occasional vortexing. Finally, the extract was spun at 14,000 rpm for 30 min to pellet the nuclei. After dialysis, the extract was aliquoted, and individual aliquots were stored at −70 °C to avoid repeated freezing and thawing of the preparation. Protein was estimated according to the Bradford method (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar), and extract was used for EMSA. The 5′-flanking region of the mouse AOP2 gene promoter (containingNheI and BglII restriction sites) was isolated with the genomic PCR kit (CLONTECH Genomic) using AOP2-specific primers. The sense primer (5′-CGGTTCTCTCCATTGCTAGCTTATTG-3′) contained aNheI site; the antisense primer (5′-GAATTAGATCTAATCCTCTGAGATCTTC-3′) contained aBglII site. The isolated fragment was cloned into theEcoRI sites of the TA vector (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced following amplification. The sites created by PCR enabled us to obtain the desired segment of the AOP2 promoter for the footprinting experiments. NheI and BglII sites were created through PCR in 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, to use for a second restriction mapping to make an end-labeled probe for footprinting. For footprinting, we made one end-labeled DNA probe by first labeling both ends of the promoter fragment using theEcoRI sites. Then we used either of the created sites (NheI or BglII) to make the probe labeled at one end. The above mentioned AOP2-TA construct was digested with NheI andBglII, and the promoter fragment was ligated into the pCAT Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) after digestion with the same enzymes. The plasmid was amplified and used for the CAT assay after co-transfection of cells with constructs. The CAT assay was carried out using CAT-ELISA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In an incubator containing 5% CO2, COS-7 and LECs were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% serum in 60-mm Petri dishes at a density of 1 × 105cells/ml. Twenty-four h later, the cells were washed with the same medium and co-transfected using the calcium phosphate method with three constructs: 1) 5 μg of GFP-LEDGF expression vector, 2) 10 μg of promoter/CAT reporter construct, and 3) 5 μg of the pSV-β-galactosidase vector. After 72 h of incubation, cells were harvested, and the extract was prepared and normalized to the soluble protein level. CAT-ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm using a microtiter plate ELISA reader. All CAT values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity (21Kimura A. Singh D.P. Wawrousek E.F. Kikuchi M. Nakamura M. Shinohara T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1152-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). CAT assays were performed using cells stably transfected with GFP-LEDGF (4Singh D.P. Ohguro N. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1444-1451PubMed Google Scholar) following co-transfection with the AOP2-CAT reporter gene. Cells transfected with empty vector served as control. CAT activity was monitored in stably transfected cells as described above. PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. We made specific mutations in the AOP2 promoter at the LEDGF binding sites. Briefly, the double-stranded pCAT-AOP2 construct was used as template DNA and three pairs of complementary primers were used to mutate the AOP2 promoter construct with PCR. The plasmid was amplified, and the mutation was confirmed by sequencing. These mutated plasmids were linked to the CAT reporter, and CAT activities were compared with those of wild type AOP2-CAT. DNase I footprinting was performed as described by Sambrook et al. (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.G. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Briefly, the AOP2/TA construct containing the 220-bp promoter fragment with theEcoRI sites at both ends was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. This was digested with BglII to get a 5′-end-labeled probe and withNheI to get a 3′-end-labeled probe. This probe was bound to LEDGF in a volume of 50 μl of binding buffer containing 8m Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 100 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm CaCl2, 8% glycerol, and 0.5 μg of poly(dI/dC) for 30 min at room temperature. The protein-DNA complexes were treated with 0.33 units (final concentration) of DNase I for 1–5 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding 140 μl of stop buffer (768 mm sodium acetate, 128 mm EDTA, 0.56% SDS, and 256 μg/ml yeast RNA) followed by phenol and ethanol precipitation. The samples were then run on 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea followed by autoradiography of the dried gel. We subcloned LEDGF cDNA into a pCDNA3 vector in reverse orientation to make a full-length LEDGF antisense construct. We used a human LEC cDNA library to isolate AOP2 cDNA having a full-length open reading frame. A full-length AOP2-antisense construct was made by subcloning of AOP2 cDNA into a pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP-TOPO vector in reverse orientation. To assess the level of the AOP2 transcript in LECs overexpressing LEDGF (GFP-LEDGF) and in cells transfected with the empty vector, we synthesized a pair of sense (5′-AGCGTCACCACTGCCGCCATG-3′) and antisense (5′-GTACTGGATGTGCAGATGCAGCC-3′) AOP2-specific primers. These primers covered the full-length 698-bp open reading frames of AOP2. To perform RT-PCR, mRNA was isolated with the Micro-Fast TrackTMkit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) from 5 × 105LECs transiently transfected with GFP-LEDGF or empty vector. The Micro-Fast Track 2 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), a cDNA synthesis kit for RT-PCR, was used to synthesize cDNA from mRNA. The resulting cDNA was used as a template for amplification of the AOP2 transcript with the specific primers mentioned above. The following cycling conditions for the PCR were used for 7 min for final extension: 94 °C for 3 min; 15, 25, or 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min; 55 °C for 2 min; and 72 °C for 3 min. Normal cells and cells overexpressing LEDGF were transfected with AOP2-antisense and LEDGF-antisense. Protein was extracted by lysing the cells in cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline) 24, 48, and 72 h after transfection, and then protein was estimated (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar). Equal concentrations of protein were applied to SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-LEDGF antibody (1:10,000 dilution), anti-GFP antibody (1:4000), or anti-AOP2 antibody (1:2000 dilution) to monitor LEDGF, GFP-LEDGF, or AOP2 bands. The same batch of cells (24, 48, and 72 h after transfection) were treated with 100 μm H2O2 for 2 h, and a colorimetric MTS assay (Promega) was performed after a 1-h recovery period to monitor the number of surviving cells in each group. The OD at 490 nm was measured after 4 h with an ELISA reader (8Fatma N. Singh D.P. Shinohara T. Chylack Jr., L.T. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 2648-2657PubMed Google Scholar). The AOP2 cDNA isolated from the lens epithelial cell library was expressed as a histidine fusion protein (His tag AOP2). PCR was performed using sense (5′-ATGCCCGGAGGTCTGCTTCTCGGGG-3′) and antisense (5′-AATTGGCAGCTGACATCCTCTGGCTC-3′) primers, and the resultant amplified product was cloned in PCR® T7/NT-TOPO. The plasmid was used to transform BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The His tag AOP2 fusion protein was purified from the bacterial lysate with metal-chelating chromatography. The protein was purified using a nickel-chelating resin (Invitrogen) under nondenaturing conditions according to the manufacturer's protocol. Pure protein was eluted with low pH (4.0) imidazole and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm EDTA and 5 mm DTT. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analyses were carried out to monitor the purification of AOP2 protein. Anti-His antibody was used to visualize the AOP2 protein in immunoblots. Also, an antibody to AOP2 was used to visualize AOP2 protein in cell extracts. For the H2O2 removal assay, we followed the method of Lim et al. (22Lim Y.S. Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Uhm T.B. Park J.W. Kim K. Kim I.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Briefly, a reaction mixture containing different concentrations of AOP2 protein in reaction buffer with 100 mm HEPES and 10 mm DTT in a final volume of 100 μl was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation, H2O2 was added at 100 μm to the reaction mixtures and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 750 μl of a trichloroacetic acid solution (12.5%) followed by the addition of a mixture of 300 μl of 10 mmFe(NH4)2SO4 and 200 μl of 2.5m KSCN, which reacted with the remaining H2O2 to form a purple complex. We monitored the removal of H2O2 by AOP2 by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 490 nm. The percentage removal was derived from the change in absorbance obtained with AOP2 compared with that without AOP2. Bovine serum albumin was used as a control for this peroxidase assay. There are multiple HSEs (GAA) and one STRE (TGGGGT) in the mouse AOP2 promoter (20Phelan S.A. Johnson K.A. Beier D.R. Paigen B. Genomics. 1998; 54: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, indicated by underlining or boldface letters). We have reported these sequences to be LEDGF binding consensus core sequences (5Singh D.P. Ohguro N. Kikuchi T. Sueno T. Reddy V.N. Yuge K. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We identified five potential LEDGF-binding sites (FP1–FP5) in the selected fragment of AOP2 promoter and confirmed LEDGF binding to these sites with EMSA. Binding of the fusion protein, GST-LEDGF, to double-stranded 12-mer probes each containing a consensus core element (FP1, FP2, FP3, FP4, or FP5) produced bands indicating the GST-LEDGF complex for each sequence. The addition of 10–100-fold molar excess of unlabeled self-competitor reduced the amount of the complex and the intensity of the band, and a 1000-fold molar excess eliminated complex formation completely with each sequence. These results were similar to those published in Ref. 9Singh D.P. Fatma N. Kimura A. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholarand are not reproduced here. To confirm that the Cm1 complexes were composed of LEDGF and DNA, an Ab supershift assay was performed with an Ab to LEDGF (9Singh D.P. Fatma N. Kimura A. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Initially, we complexed purified GST-LEDGF with the radiolabeled FP1 probe (see Cm1 band in Fig. 2, lane 1). We added anti-LEDGF Ab to the mixture and noted on the gel that the Cm1 band had shifted to a higher molecular weight position (see the Ss1 band in Fig. 2, lane 2). These results showed that anti-LEDGF Abs bound to LEDGF in the GST-LEDGF-FP1 complexes and formed a larger complex. To ascertain whether native LEDGF in cells also bound to these sequences, we incubated the FP1 probe with a HeLa cell nuclear extract. An antibody supershift assay in combination with EMSA was performed to confirm that the probe bound to native LEDGF. Fig. 2 shows that a specific Cm1 band was generated between the LEDGF present in the HeLa cell (Fig. 2, lanes 4–6) and LEC nuclear extracts (Fig. 2, lanes 7–9). The addition of unlabeled competitor resulted in a significant decrease in complex formation (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 9). Furthermore, this band was shifted to a position of higher molecular weight when Ab was added (Ss1 band in Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 8). These results indicated that LEDGF in HeLa and LEC nuclear extracts bound specifically to FP1 probe. HeLa cell and LEC nuclear extracts contained LEDGF as reported earlier (3Ge H. Si Y. Wolffe J.P. Mol Cell. 1998; 2: 751-759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar,9Singh D.P. Fatma N. Kimura A. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To confirm that LEDGF bound to the HSE and STRE, we performed DNase I footprinting analyses with an AOP2 promoter fragment. The end-labeled probe was incubated with bovine serum albumin and 0, 10, and 100 ng/ml GST-LEDGF, and then the mixtures were treated with DNase I. The regions protected from DNase I were FP1 (−11 to −20), FP2 (−84 to −94), FP3 (−136 to −144), FP4 (−147 to −154), and FP5 (−163 to −172) (see Fig.3). These protected regions contained sequences (AGAA or TGGGGT) that are found also in HSE and STRE, respectively. Although we expected to find two more LEDGF binding sites (CS1 and CS2), we were not able to demonstrate LEDGF protection of these sites in the DNase I footprinting experiments. Next EMSA was performed using synthetic oligonucleotides whose sequences corresponded to those of the protected regions. A double-stranded 26-bp fragment of region 1 (Fig.4, FPR1) was selected and synthesized (5′-TTAGAGGTCTTGGGGTATAGCCCTCT-3′). LEDGF had bound to the underlined sequence and had protected DNA in that region from DNase I in the footprinting experiment. The boldface lettering indicates potential LEDGF binding sites; in fact, LEDGF bound well to this probe. Mutating STRE (from TGGGGT to TGATGT, Mut1-1) resulted in a significant reduction in LEDGF binding. Another fragment, FPR3→4, contained two AGAAA sequences (CAATAAGAAAACCACTTTCTTTTG), and this also showed strong LEDGF binding in EMSA. When one site AGAA was mutated to AAAA (Fig. 4, Mut3-1), the binding was reduced comparatively, but when both sites were mutated (Fig. 4, Mut3-2) LEDGF binding was reduced significantly. The fragment FPR5 contained the AGAA sequence, and LEDGF bound well to it; however, when we mutated it from AGAA to TTTT, LEDGF bound weakly (Fig. 4, Mut5-1). These results confirmed that LEDGF bound to HSE (nGAAn) and STRE ((A/T)GGGG(A/T)) and that the consensus sequences (nGAAn and (A/T)GGGG(A/T)) were directly related to the binding affinity. Next, we investigated whether LEDGF trans-activated the AOP2 promoter. A construct between nucleotides −194 and +23 in the AOP2 promoter was fused to a CAT reporter gene to form AOP2-CAT (Figs. 1 and5). The selected region contained a number of elements sufficient to activate the AOP2 promoter (20Phelan S.A. Johnson K.A. Beier D.R. Paigen B. Genomics. 1998; 54: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We transfected the construct into COS-7 cells (Fig. 5A) and mouse LECs (Fig. 5B). Prior to this experiment, the COS-7 cells and LECs had been stably transfected with a plasmid construct having GFP-LEDGF or empty vector. A high CAT value was seen in these stably transfected COS-7 cells and LECs (Fig. 5, comparecolumns 1 and 2). These results indicated that LEDGF bound to HSE and STRE of the AOP2 promoter and activated them. To prove that trans-activation of the AOP2 promoter by LEDGF is HSE- and STRE-dependent and that other elements are not involved, HSE and STRE were mutated from AGAATGTTTG to AAAATGTTTG (Mut1), AAGAAAA to AAAAAAA (Mut2), TTTCTTTTG to ATTTTTTTG (Mut3), AGAGGG to ATACGG (Mut4), and ACCCCA to ACACCA (Mut5) as shown in Fig.6, using site-directed mutagenesis. If mutations Mut1 + Mut2 were present together in the same construct, there was a 40% loss of CAT activity. If mutations Mut1, Mut2, and Mut3 were present together in the same construct, there was a 60% loss of CAT activity, and if mutations Mut1, Mut2, Mut3, Mut4, and Mut5 were present together in the construct, there was an 80% loss of CAT activity (Fig. 6). Each mutation of HSE or STRE resulted in a decrease of some transcriptional activity, and this gradual reduction suggested that each consensus element had made a contribution to the total trans-activation of the AOP2 promoter. When we mutated five binding sites, we noted an 80% loss in promoter activity. The other LEDGF-dependent sites in the AOP2 promoter (FP2 and CS2; Fig. 1) may be responsible for the remaining 20% activity. To ascertain whether LEDGF activated the AOP2 gene, we extracted mRNAs from lens epithelial cells transfected with GFP-LEDGF and vector control. The amount of mRNA in the extracts was estimated by semiquantitative RT-PCR with the appropriate probes, and the results showed that expression of the AOP2 gene was many times greater in LECs transfected with the GFP-LEDGF construct than in LECs transfected with empty vector (Fig. 7). These results also indicated that LEDGF stimulated the AOP2 gene. LECs transfected with a construct of GFP-LEDGF sense overexpressed GFP-LEDGF (Fig. 8, A-1), these cells also expressed a higher level of AOP2 protein (Fig. 8, A-2). When these LEDGF-overexpressing cells were transfected with AOP2-antisense, the expression of GFP-LEDGF remained the same, but AOP2 protein was diminished significantly (Fig. 8, A-2,empty column). Conversely, when these cells were transfected with LEDGF-antisense, the expression of both GFP-LEDGF and AOP2 was reduced significantly (Fig. 8, A-1 andA-2, gray columns). Similarly, we transfected normal LECs with AOP2-antisense and LEDGF-antisense constructs. In the cells transfected with AOP2-antisense, there was no change in the LEDGF protein level (Fig. 8,B-1), but the expression of AOP2 protein decreased significantly (Fig. 8, B-2). In cells transfected with GFP-LEDGF-"

The S and R diastereoisomers of cyclodeoxyadenosine on DNA were investigated separately for their ability to block 3′ to 5′ exonucleases. The mammalian DNA-editing enzyme DNase III (TREX1) was blocked by both diastereoisomers, whereas only the S diastereoisomer was highly efficient in preventing digestion by the exonuclease function of T4 DNA polymerase. Digestion in both cases was frequently blocked one residue before the modified base.

On the S diastereoisomer, pol η could catalyze the incorporation of one nucleotide opposite the lesion but could not continue elongation. Although pol η preferentially incorporated dAMP opposite the R diastereoisomer, elongation continued only when dTMP was incorporated, suggesting bypass of this lesion by pol η with reasonable fidelity. With theS diastereoisomer, pol η mainly incorporated dAMP or dTMP opposite the lesion but could not elongate even after incorporating a correct nucleotide. These data suggest that the Sdiastereoisomer may be a more cytotoxic DNA lesion than theR diastereoisomer.

However, oxidation of purines also occurs, in particular in association with saturation or fragmentation of the imidazole ring of guanine. These lesions are generally removed by specialized DNA glycosylases called Nth and Fpg in Escherichia coli, and NTH1 and OGG1 in human cells (3Lindahl T. Wood R.D.

A structurally unusual form of lesion generated by hydroxyl radicals is a cyclopurine deoxynucleoside (cyPu).1 These are increasingly recognized as significant, chemically stable lesions after exposure of cells or DNA solutions to oxygen free radicals, with cyclodeoxyadenosine being formed slightly more frequently than cyclodeoxyguanosine (4Dizdaroglu M. Dirksen M.L. Jiang H.X. Robbins J.H. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 929-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 5Schroder E. Budzinski E.E. Wallace J.C. Zimbrick J.D. Box H.C. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1995; 68: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A covalent bond is formed between the C-8 position of the purine and the C-5′ residue of the adjacent deoxyribose. Consequently, the base is attached to the DNA backbone by two covalent bonds, one of which is the normal glycosyl bond. After γ-irradiation of a neutral DNA solution under N2O, 8,5′-cyclo-2′-deoxyadenosine was generated at a 10-fold lower yield that the major lesions 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine or thymine glycol (6Dizdaroglu M. Jaruga P. Rodriguez H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 774-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The cyPu lesions have recently been shown to be corrected by nucleotide excision repair (NER) rather than by a process related to base excision repair or direct damage reversal (7Kuraoka I. Bender C.

Thus, the main mode of repair for this form of oxidative DNA damage is different from that of the great majority of oxidative base lesions. A cyPu can occur in two stereoisomeric forms, 5′R and 5′S (Fig. 1). Oxygen free radicals generate the 5′S and 5′R isomers in similar amounts in double-stranded DNA, whereas the 5′R diastereoisomer is predominant in single-stranded DNA (1Dizdaroglu M. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1992; 61: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 2Cadet J. Delatour T. Douki T. Gasparutto D. Pouget J.P. Ravanat J.L. Sauvaigo S. Mutat.

Until recently, synthesis of oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing these adducts has been technically difficult, in particular with regard to the Rdiastereoisomer (9Romieu A. Gasparutto D. Molko D. Cadet J. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 5245-5249Crossref Google Scholar, 10Romieu A. Gasparutto D. Cadet J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 412-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Because both cyPu lesions inhibit DNA synthesis by replicative mammalian and microbial DNA polymerases (7Kuraoka I. Bender C. Romieu A. Cadet J. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3832-3837Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and the S isomer of cyPu blocks gene expression (8Brooks P.J. Wise D.S. Berry D.A. Kosmoski J.V. Smerdon M.J. Somers R.L. Mackie H.

Here, we have evaluated the susceptibility of oligonucleotides containing this lesion in either of its diastereoisomeric forms to several 3′ exonucleases. The results suggest that stereospecific differences between R- and S-cyPu residues affect the exonucleolytic activity. Oligonucleotides with either a singleR- or S-cyPu residue were further tested as substrates for translesion synthesis by human polymerase η (pol η). Human pol η is the product of the XPV gene, which is mutated in a cancer-prone genetic disorder, xeroderma pigmentosum variant (11Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Yamada A. Dohmae N. Yokoi M. Yuasa M.

The enzyme can catalyze efficient and accurate translesion synthesis opposite lesions such as a cyclobutane thymine dimer generated by UV irradiation (11Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Yamada A. Dohmae N.

Genet. 2000; 25: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). We find that stereospecific differences between R- and S-cyPu residues also affect translesion synthesis, with the S-cyPu much less efficiently bypassed. As reported previously (7Kuraoka I. Bender C. Romieu A. Cadet J. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3832-3837Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), the Sdiastereoisomer is removed by NER even less efficiently than theR isomer. The present data provide additional reasons why the S diastereoisomer might be more of a challenge to cell survival than the R diastereoisomer in vivo. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides with either a (5′R)-5′,8-cyclo-2′-deoxyadenosine (5′R-cyclo-dA) or (5′S)-5′,8-cyclo-2′-deoxyadenosine residue (5′S-cyclo-dA) were prepared using modified phosphoramidite chemistry as described (9Romieu A.

Toxicol. 1999; 12: 412-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The lesions were incorporated into the sequence 5′-CACTTCGGXTCGTGACTGATCT-3′, where X is 5′R-cyclo-dA or 5′S-cyclo-dA. The oligonucleotides were 5′-phosphorylated using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and then purified on a denaturing 16% polyacrylamide gel. Double-stranded DNA substrates for exonucleases were prepared by annealing with a complementary strand of sequence 5′-AGATCAGTCACGATCCGAAGTG-3′. Mammalian DNase III (TREX1), which is a major nuclear DNA-specific 3′ exonuclease with properties of an editing factor, was purified from cell nuclei as described (14Höss M. Robins P. Naven T.J. Pappin D.J. Sgouros J. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3868-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). T4 DNA polymerase, which has a 3′ exonucleolytic function, was obtained from New England Biolabs. For 3′ exonucleolytic digestion, 5′-32P end-labeled oligonucleotides containing either a 5′R-cyclo-dA or 5′S-cyclo-dA residue or control oligonucleotides without a lesion were incubated with different amounts of exonucleases as indicated in the figure legends. T4 DNA polymerase was assayed in 10-μl reaction mixtures containing 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 30 min. For mammalian DNase III assays, 10-μl reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μl/ml bovine serum albumin were used, and incubations were at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 8 μl of stop solution containing 95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 0.025% xylene cyanol. Oligonucleotide fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a denaturing 16% polyacrylamide gel, dried, and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak Bio-Max) or a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics). The 5′-32P-labeled primer-template DNA was prepared by mixing a 13-mer (Fig.3A) or 14-mer (Fig. 4, C and D) primer labeled at its 5′ end with a 22-mer oligonucleotide containing either a 5′R-cyclo-dA or a 5′S-cyclo-dA residue at a molar ratio of 1:1. Reaction mixtures of 5 μl contained 40 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm MgCl2, the four dNTPs at 100 μm each, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 250 μl/ml bovine serum albumin, 60 mm KCl, 2.5% glycerol, and 40 nm of the 5′-32P-labeled primer-template DNA were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 8 μl of stop solution. Products were separated by electrophoresis on a denaturing 16% polyacrylamide gel, dried, and exposed as described above.Figure 4Nucleotide selectivity of pol η incorporation opposite a cyPu lesion.A, schematic drawing of a 22-mer oligonucleotide with the lesion, annealed to a 32P-labeled primer.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The attendant changes in DNA conformation would greatly weaken base pairing with a complementary residue in the double helix (15Miaskiewicz K. Miller J.H. Fuciarelli A.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The distorted structure of the lesion is consistent with its ability to block DNA replication and transcription (7Kuraoka I. Bender C. Romieu A. Cadet J. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3832-3837Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 8Brooks P.J. Wise D.S. Berry D.A. Kosmoski J.V. Smerdon M.J. Somers R.L. Mackie H. Spoonde A.Y. Ackerman E.J. Coleman K.

Distinct structural distortions of DNA caused by the two diastereoisomers of cyPu residues could be detected in principle by the relative sensitivities of the lesions to exonucleolytic digestion. To investigate this point, oligonucleotides containing a site-specific cyPu residue were incubated with T4 DNA polymerase, which functions as a processive 3′ to 5′ exonuclease in the absence of deoxynucleoside triphosphates. This enzyme has been used previously to detect bulky DNA lesions such as UV photoproducts, psoralen interstrand cross-links, and cisplatin adducts. Exonucleolytic activity is typically blocked 1–3 nucleotides from the site of bulky DNA damage (16Moggs J.G. Yarema K.J. Essigmann J.M. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7177-7186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 17Rampino N.J. Bohr V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10977-10981Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Fig.2B shows that the exonucleolytic activity of T4 DNA polymerase is strongly inhibited one nucleotide from 5′S-cyclo-dA as indicated by the accumulation of a 10-mer even after attempted digestion at high enzyme concentrations. In contrast, the oligonucleotide containing 5′R-cyclo-dA could be cleaved to mononucleotides, although the lesion functioned as a pause site that partly blocked exonuclease activity, as seen at lower enzyme concentrations (Fig. 2B,lanes 6–10). These results demonstrate that stereospecific differences between the 5′R- and 5′S-cyclo-dA residues differently affect the exonucleolytic action of T4 DNA polymerase. It is interesting that the 5′S diastereoisomer was a much stronger block to exonucleolytic degradation by T4 DNA polymerase than the 5′R analogue, although the Rform was a better NER substrate than the S form (7Kuraoka I. Bender C. Romieu A. Cadet J. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3832-3837Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The mammalian nuclear 3′ to 5′ exonuclease DNase III/TREX1 can remove a mismatched nucleotide residue from the 3′ terminus of double-stranded DNA and effectively digests nondamaged single-stranded DNA (14Höss M. Robins P. Naven T.J. Pappin D.J. Sgouros J. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3868-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 18Mazur D.J. Perrino F.W. J. Biol.

This enzyme has sequence homology with the proofreading DnaQ protein of the E. coli pol III holoenzyme as well as with the 3′ exonuclease domain of eukaryotic DNA polymerase ε, and has biochemical properties consistent with a role in DNA editing. Fig.2C shows that the exonucleolytic activity of DNase III was strongly blocked by both 5′R- and 5′S-cyclo-dA (lanes 6–15), whereas oligonucleotides without a lesion were completely digested (lanes 1–5). The strong block to DNase III digestion by a 5′R-cyclo-dA residue was in contrast to the results obtained with T4 DNA polymerase (Fig.2B, lanes 6–10). The predominant digestion product of 5′R-cyclo-dA by DNase III was a 9-mer, whereas that of 5′S-cyclo-dA was a 10-mer at the same enzyme concentration. These observations also indicated that stereospecific differences between 5′R- and 5′S-cyclo-dA residues differently affect the exonucleolytic action of DNase III. In additional experiments, oligonucleotides with a cyPu residue were incubated with the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of E. coliexonuclease III, snake venom phosphodiesterase, or nuclease P1 in similar assays. A small region adjacent to the cyPu lesion was apparently protected from digestion by these enzymes, indicating that cyPu residues in monomeric form could not be released (data not shown). However, we did not detect stereospecific differences between digestion of 5′R- and 5′S-cyclo-dA residues with these enzymes. To examine whether pol η had translesion synthesis activity at cyPu residues, a 22-mer oligonucleotide containing a single lesion was employed as template and annealed to a 5′-32P-labeled 13-mer oligonucleotide (Fig.3A). The latter served as a primer and was positioned so that the first nucleotide was incorporated opposite a single 5′R- or 5′S-cyclo-dA residue. T7 DNA polymerase (T7 pol), and pol η could synthesize DNA products of up to 22 nucleotides in length on the control template (Fig.3B, lanes 1–6). Under these conditions, synthesis increased linearly up to 1.2 fmol of pol η, suggesting that the enzyme catalyzed synthesis without recycling. As reported previously (11Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Yamada A. Dohmae N. Yokoi M. Yuasa M. Araki M. Iwai S. Takio K. Hanaoka F. Nature. 1999; 399: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar, 12Johnson R.E. Kondratick C.M. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science. 1999; 285: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), pol η is able to bypass UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, similar to related translesion polymerases such asE. coli pol V (umuD′2·C complex) (19Tang M.

Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31763-31766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and yeast pol η (21Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science. 1999; 283: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). When the template DNA contained a 5′R-cyclo-dA residue, pol η could catalyze some translesion synthesis at higher enzyme concentrations (Fig.3B, lanes 8–12). On the other hand, using template DNA with a 5′S-cyclo-dA residue, pol η incorporated one nucleotide opposite the single lesion in reactions with a high enzyme concentration, but bypass products were hardly detected (Fig. 3B, lanes 14–18). T7 pol could incorporate one nucleotide opposite either 5′R- or 5′S-cyclo-dA residues (Fig. 3B, lanes 7 and 13) as reported (7Kuraoka I. Bender C. Romieu A. Cadet J. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3832-3837Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). From these results, we conclude that human pol η has the ability to bypass a 5′R-cyclo-dA residue with only weak activity on the 5′S diastereoisomer. To examine the nucleotide preference for incorporation opposite a lesion by pol η, polymerization reactions were performed in the presence of only a single deoxynucleotide (Fig.4A). Pol η replicates undamaged DNA with low fidelity (22Matsuda T. Bebenek K. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Kunkel T.A. Nature. 2000; 404: 1011-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). As reported previously (11Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Yamada A. Dohmae N. Yokoi M. Yuasa M. Araki M. Iwai S. Takio K. Hanaoka F. Nature. 1999; 399: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar), pol η stops synthesis after incorporating an incorrect nucleotide even on undamaged templates. This activity was observed on our control template (Fig. 4B, lanes 4–7). When A was the template nucleotide, dTTP was incorporated more than other nucleotides. On a template containing a 5′R-cyclo-dA residue, pol η instead preferred to incorporate dATP but could also incorporate the other three nucleotides to some extent (Fig. 4B, lanes 11–14). On the other hand, using a template containing a 5′S-cyclo-dA residue, pol η preferentially incorporated either dAMP or dTMP opposite the lesion (Fig. 4B,lanes 18–21). For lesion bypass, nucleotides must be incorporated beyond the lesion after the initial incorporation (in this case, “incorrect” dAMP or “correct” dTMP) opposite the lesion. To test this model, we designed two sets of 14-mer primers that had two different sequences at their 3′ ends, to determine which sequence allowed pol η to elongate past the lesion. When the 14-mer primer had the sequence A opposite a control dA, 5′R-, or 5′S-cyclo-dA, pol η could not continue synthesis of DNA chains from a primer terminus (Fig. 4C, lanes 2–4). These data indicate that pol η stopped DNA synthesis after incorporating one dAMP opposite the lesion. On a primer containing the sequence T (the correct nucleotide), pol η could elongate DNA chains on the control-dA or 5′R-cyclo-dA but only inefficiently on the 5′S-cyclo-dA (Fig.4D). The cyPu lesions generated by reactive oxygen species potentially have a cytotoxic effect by inhibiting DNA replication and transcription. Such lesions in DNA can be removed by the nucleotide excision-repair (NER) machinery, albeit inefficiently, but not by the base excision-repair machinery and not by a direct reversal reaction in human cells (7Kuraoka I.

In this study, we have found that stereospecific differences between the 5′R- and 5′S-cyclo-dA residues affect the relative resistance to exonucleolytic activity (Fig. 2) and give rise to different efficiencies of translesion synthesis by pol η (Figs. 3and 4). We noted differences previously in the efficiency of the human NER pathway to remove the 5′R- and 5′S-cyclo-dA lesions from double-stranded DNA. The S diastereoisomer was less efficiently removed by NER than the R isomer in human cells. These and current data are summarized in TableI. Oxygen free radicals generate the 5′S and 5′R isomer in similar amounts in duplex DNA (1Dizdaroglu M. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1992; 61: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 2Cadet J.

Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 929-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because the S diastereoisomer is less efficiently repaired and, as shown here, is also less efficiently bypassed by pol η, the S diastereoisomer is likely to be a more highly cytotoxic DNA lesion than the Rdiastereoisomer in vivo.Table ISummary of NER efficiency, translesion synthesis by pol η, and resistance to exonuclease action at cyPu residuesCyPuNERTranslesion, ηDNase III/TREX1T4 DNA polymerase, exonuclease functionRSimilar to pyrimidine dimer PossibleBlocked at lesionDigested after pauseSVery low PoorBlocked one residue before lesionBlocked Open table in a new tab To bypass the 5′S diastereoisomer, human cells might need another polymerase or co-factor in addition to pol η. Such error-prone bypass reactions could result in mutations caused by cyPu residues. By comparison, it has been reported that yeast pol η stops DNA synthesis after incorporating one dCMP opposite an AAF-G and either dGMP or dAMP opposite an apurinic/apyrimidinic site (23Tang J.Y. Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Mol Cell. 2000; 5: 737-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and that yeast pol ζ can then extend DNA synthesis past the AP site. Another group (24Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Nature. 2000; 406: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) reported that human pol ι (hRad30B) incorporated one nucleotide opposite a (6-4) T-T photoproduct but that the enzyme was unable to extend DNA synthesis past the lesion. Yeast pol ζ could extend this product. In E. coli, RecA protein efficiently stimulates lesion bypass by pol V (23Tang J.Y. Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Mol Cell. 2000; 5: 737-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Because cyPu lesions seem to be removed only by the nucleotide excision repair system in vivo, NER-defective xeroderma pigmentosum patients may accumulate this stable chemical lesion in the DNA of nonregenerating cells over long periods of time, because of endogenous oxidative damage. Lesion accumulation could also be fostered in dividing cells by translesion polymerases such as pol η and pol ζ. Because cyPu lesions potentially could inhibit both DNA replication and transcription (8Brooks P.J. Wise D.S. Berry D.A. Kosmoski J.V. Smerdon M.J. Somers R.L. Mackie H. Spoonde A.Y. Ackerman E.J.

Randerath and co-workers used a sensitive 32P-postlabeling method to detect small amounts of indigenous altered nucleotides, called I compounds, in enzymatic hydrolysates of DNA from mammalian cells (for review, see Ref. 25Randerath K. Randerath E. Zhou G.D. Li D. Mutat. Res. 1999; 424: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The chemical nature of the various I compounds, each of which is typically present at a level of 5–200 residues/mammalian genome, have remained unknown. However, several major I compounds that were particularly abundant after cellular oxidative stress have been identified recently, as dinucleotides containing a 8,5′-cyclo-2′-deoxyadenosine moiety (26Randerath K.

These finding provide strong evidence that cyPu residues are highly relevant oxidative lesions in mammalian DNA. They are presumably generated continuously by oxidative stress and then are slowly removed by nucleotide excision repair, so that a steady state level of the lesion is observed in vivo. We thank Drs.

The physiologic role of TRAIL is presumably more complex than merely activating caspase-mediated cell death. To shed light into TRAIL-mediated signaling, we used DNA microarrays to profile gene expression mediated by TRAIL in breast carcinoma cells. Primary response genes induced by TRAIL included a number of known NF-κB-dependent genes such as cIAP2, A20, and E-selectin. Remarkably, global transcriptome analysis revealed that TRAIL also induced a cohort of genes related to the interferon-signaling pathway. Assessing interferon-induced gene expression suggested various points of interaction with the TRAIL signaling pathway. Interestingly, while we observed interferon-mediated up-regulation of TRAIL, we also demonstrated a concomitant TRAIL-mediated induction of interferon-β. Combining TRAIL and interferon in vitro, synergistically induced apoptosis and caspase activation in breast cancer cells. Together, these data indicate multiple levels of molecular cross-talk between the two diverse cytokines with anti-tumor properties. TRAIL/APO-2L induces apoptosis in a variety of transformed cells and has potential as an anti-cancer therapeutic. The physiologic role of TRAIL is presumably more complex than merely activating caspase-mediated cell death.

A subset of these ligands is known to activate the cell death program including TNF, Fas ligand, DR3 ligand (TWEAK), and TRAIL. Of these, TRAIL has garnered the most interest therapeutically, as several studies have demonstrated in vivo tumoricidal activity in animal models without significant toxicity (4Chinnaiyan A.M.

Death ligands induce apoptosis by activating their cognate receptors on the surface of cells. These death receptors are members of the TNF receptor superfamily and include TNFRI, Fas (CD95/APO-1), DR-3 (death receptor-3), DR-4, DR-5, and DR-6 (1Schulze-Osthoff K. Ferrari D. Los M.

Science. 1997; 276: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). Once activated, the death receptors, in general, bind the cytoplasmic adaptor molecule FADD, which functions as a molecular bridge to caspase-8, a protease at the apex of the cell death cascade (11Boldin M.P.

DR-4 and DR-5 have been proposed to indirectly bind FADD via the GTP-binding adaptor molecule, DAP3 (13Miyazaki T. Reed J.C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). By inducing proximity between pro-caspase-8 molecules, which possess weak protease activity, death receptor clustering facilitates trans-proteolysis and consequent activation of the cell death machinery (14Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 15Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). TNF family ligands also have important nonapoptotic functions. For example, many death ligands (especially TNFα) are known to activate transcription through NF-κB and AP-1, leading to induction of inflammatory and immunomodulatory genes (16Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Activation of these nonapoptotic pathways involves a host of signaling mediators including TRADD, TRAF2, RIP, NIK, and others. Even FADD, a molecule required for endogenous activation of capsase-8, has functions outside of regulating cell suicide, including proposed roles in survival and proliferation (17Newton K. Harris A.W. Strasser A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 18Newton K. Kurts C. Harris A.W. Strasser A. Curr.

FADD-deficient mice die in utero, suggesting that FADD has an important role in developmental pathways (22Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 23Yeh W.C. Pompa J.L. McCurrach M.E. Shu H.B. Elia A.J. Shahinian A. Ng M. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Mitchell K. El-Deiry W.S. Lowe S.W. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1954-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). However, relatively little is known about possible nonapoptotic functions induced by TRAIL. To shed light into death ligand signaling and function, we studied gene expression profiles elicited by these cytokines. By using a functional genomics approach, we identified novel primary response genes induced by TRAIL and related death ligands. A dominant negative version of FADD (FADD-DN), inhibited much of the gene activation mediated by death ligands, further emphasizing the role of FADD in nonapoptotic signaling induced by death receptors. To our surprise, a cohort of genes induced by TRAIL at a late time point (≥16 h), is classically associated with the interferon signaling pathway, including ISGF3γ, STAT-1, PKR, IL-6, and IFNγR2, among others. Several genes identified by microarray were validated at the transcript level by Northern blot analysis and at the protein level by immunoblotting. While TRAIL transcript and protein were induced by interferons, we also demonstrated TRAIL-mediated up-regulation of IFNβ transcript and protein. Functionally, TRAIL and interferons had a synergistic effect in the induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells. As our study demonstrates that TRAIL can induce interferon pathways, presumably via up-regulation of IFNβ, exposure of cancer cells to interferons may “prime” cells for apoptosis by TRAIL. The diverse gene expression profiles activated by the TRAIL signaling pathway may provide clues to diverse physiologic roles of TRAIL in vivo. MCF7 breast cancer cells, stably transfected with pCDNA3 and FADD-DN constructs (24Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. J.

Treatment with various reagents was carried out on subconfluent plates (∼4–6 million cells per 100-mm tissue culture plate) with fresh medium at the following concentrations: 1000 ng/ml TRAIL (4Chinnaiyan A.M.

Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed once with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol at −20 °C for 10 min. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and stained at room temperature for 10 min in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma), 10 μg/ml RNase A (Promega), and 0.01% Triton X-100. After an additional PBS wash, the cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Propidium iodide stained the condensed fragmented chromatin of apoptotic nuclei intensely as opposed to diffuse nuclear staining associated with normal cells (24Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4961-4965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Three independent experiments were performed for each data point with over 250 cells counted per sample. Percent apoptosis was calculated as a mean ± S.D. DNA microarray analysis of gene expression was done essentially as described by the Brown Lab (available at www.microarrays.org) and in Refs. 26Dhanasekaran M.S. Barrette T.R. Ghosh D. Shah R.

The sequence-verified cDNA clones on the human cDNA microarray are listed in the Supplementary Material and are available from the Research Genetics web site (www.resgen.com). Purified PCR products, generated using the clone inserts as template, were spotted onto poly-l-lysine-coated microscope slides using an Omnigrid robotic arrayer (GeneMachines) equipped with quill-type pins (Majer Scientific). Based on the latest Unigene build-136, our 10,000 human cDNA microarray covers ∼5996 unique, known, named genes and 2674 ESTs. Of these, 495 genes are present in duplicates, which serve as internal controls. Protocols for printing and post-processing of arrays are available in the public domain (www.microarrays.org). Approximately 4–6 million cells per 100-mm tissue culture plate were washed with PBS, homogenized in Trizol (Invitrogen), and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's protocol. An extra phenol-chloroform extraction was performed to improve the quality of RNA. RNA integrity was judged by denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis. Total RNA was quantified and stored in aliquots at −80 °C until use. Fifteen micrograms of total RNA was routinely used as template for cDNA generation using reverse transcriptase (RT) (Invitrogen). Inclusion of amino allyl-dUTP (Sigma) in the RT reaction allowed for subsequent fluorescent labeling of cDNA using monofunctional NHS ester dyes (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.) as described at www.microarrays.org. In each experiment, fluorescent cDNA probes were prepared from an experimental RNA sample (coupled to monofunctional Cy5 NHS-ester) and an appropriate reference RNA sample (coupled to monofunctional Cy3 NHS-ester). The labeled probes were then hybridized to 10,000 human cDNA microarrays at 65 °C overnight as described previously (www.microarrays.org). Fluorescent images of hybridized microarrays were obtained using a GenePix 4000A microarray scanner (www.axon.com, Axon Instruments). Primary analysis was done using the GenePix software package (Axon Instruments). Cy5 to Cy3 ratios are determined for the individual genes along with various other quality control parameters (e.g. intensity over local background). Furthermore, bad spots or areas of the array with obvious defects were manually flagged. Spots with small diameters (<50 microns) and spots with low signal strengths <350 fluorescence intensity units over local background in the more intense channel were discarded. Flagged spots were not included in subsequent analyses. These files were then imported into a Microsoft Access data base. Prior to clustering, the normalized median of ratio values of the genes were log base 2 transformed and filtered for the presence across arrays and selected for expression levels and patterns depending on the experimental set as stated in the figure legends. Average linkage hierarchical clustering of an uncentered Pearson correlation similarity matrix was applied using the program Cluster (28Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13268) Google Scholar), and the results were visualized with the program TreeView (28Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13268) Google Scholar). Thirty micrograms of total RNA was resolved by denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred onto Hybond membrane (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.) by a capillary transfer set up. Hybridizations were performed as previously described (29Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). Briefly, prehybridization was performed for 1 h at 65 °C in a solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V), 8% SDS, 0.5m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Hybridization was performed in prehybridization buffer for 16 h at 65 °C after adding the denatured probe at 2–3 × 106 cpm/ml concentration. Blots were washed with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature three times over a period of 30 min. Subsequently, the blots were washed twice in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 60 min. Signal was visualized and quantitated by PhosphorImager. Data was culled using PhosphorImager software. The signal intensities were normalized against GAPDH signal intensities. For relative fold estimation, the ratio of the intensity of the respective transcript in the test sample over the transcript intensity in the reference sample was determined. One microgram of total RNA from experimental samples was reverse transcribed with Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), using oligo(dT) and random hexanucleotide primer for first-strand cDNA synthesis. PCRs were performed directly on 1 μl of first-strand cDNA using 500 nmol each of gene-specific primer (IFNβ: forward primer, 5′-tctcctccaaattgctctcctgtt-3′, reverse primer, 5′-cagaaggaggacgccgca-3′; IFNγ: forward primer, 5′-tttgggttctcttggctgttact-3′, reverse, primer 5′-acagaaaaataatgcagagccaaa-3′; and GAPDH: forward primer, 5′-cggagtcaacggatttggtcgtat-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-agccttctccatggtggtgaagac-3′) in a 100-μl reaction volume comprised of 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate. PCR was carried out for initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 25, 42, and 45 cycles (for GAPDH, IFNβ, and IFNγ, respectively) of denaturation (94 °C for 1 min), annealing (55 °C for GAPDH and IFNβ, 59 °C for IFNγ, for 1 min), and extension (72 °C for 1 min) with 5 units ofTaq polymerase (Invitrogen). This was followed by a final extension step of 72 °C for 10 min. The products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide and visualized with ultraviolet light. Whole cell lysates prepared from MCF7 cells treated with a combination of zVADfmk, IFN-β, and TRAIL were separated on SDS-PAGE. The proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.) and blocked overnight in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20 at 4 °C. The membranes were then incubated for 2 h with antibodies directed against caspase-7 (Cell Signaling Technology), caspase-8 (Cell Signaling Technology), STAT-1 (Cell Signaling Technology), phospho (Tyr-701)-specific STAT-1, BID (Cell Signaling Technology), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Cell Signaling Technology), TRAIL (PharMingen), β-tubulin (NeoMarkers), or actin (Sigma). Membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing the membrane with TBS-T, signals were visualized by the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.). Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (IP buffer) containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), complete proteinase inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated with 1.5 μg of mouse monoclonal antibody against human IFN-β (PBL Biomedicals) in a total volume of 400 μl of IP buffer and rotated end-over-end at 4 °C for 90 min. Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.) equilibrated in IP buffer were added and the reactions were incubated for a further 60 min. IP reactions were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold IP buffer, resuspended in 40 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and 10 μl of sample was run on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gradient gels (Gradipore). The separated proteins were transferred onto PVDF membrane (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.). The membrane was incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween (TBS-T) and 5% nonfat dry milk). Biotinylated anti-human IFN-β (R&D systems) was applied at 1:10000 in TBS-T with 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with TBS-T buffer, the membrane was incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Invitrogen) at 1:5000 in TBST with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. ECL was performed as described in the previous section. MCF7 cells were split and grown overnight in 24-well tissue culture plates (Costar) at a density of 62,500 cells per well. Preincubation with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) for 30 min was followed by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium minus methionine and cysteine for 15 min. The cells were then incubated in the above medium containing 250 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (l-methionine:l-cysteine 70:30), specific activity >1,000 Ci/mm (10 mCi/ml) (ICN Radiochemicals) at both 4 and 24 h at 37 °C in 10% CO2. Cells were harvested in 100 μl of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.02m Tris, pH 7.4, and complete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet). Lysates were spotted on 2.4-cm glass microfiber (GF/C) filter (Whatman) and air dried. Labeled proteins were precipitated by soaking the filters in 20% trichloroacetic acid (JT Baker Inc.) for 4 min with gentle shaking. The filters were then washed in 70% alcohol, dried, and counted in Econo-SafeTM (Research Products Int. Corp) in a scintillation counter. 96-Well plates (Nunc Immunoplate Maxisorb) were coated with 100 ng/ml anti-IFN-γ mAb (PBL Biomedical Laboratories) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The plates were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Fisher Biotech) and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with BlockerTMBlotto (Pierce) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. All subsequent incubations were conducted at room temperature with shaking. The plates were washed and incubated for 1 h with different dilutions of purified IFN-γ (Standard) and the total cell lysates (diluted 1:2) in dilution medium (PBS with 10% Blotto, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and 0.05% Tween 20. Plates were washed and incubated with the detection antibody, biotinylated rabbit polyclonal α-IFN-γ Ab (1:500 in dilution medium) for 1 h. After washing, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, 1:20,000 in dilution medium) was added and plates were incubated for 30 min. After a final wash, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Genzyme Diagnostics) was added, and plates were incubated in the dark for 15 min. The reaction was terminated using 1.5 n H2SO4. The plates were then read at dual wavelengths (465 and 590 nm) on a Bio-Tek microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments) and IFN-γ concentrations were estimated using a standard curve based on dilutions of recombinant IFNγ (R&D Biosystems). SUM149 cells were grown at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells per well overnight in 12-well tissue culture plates. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100. The assay was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol (Enzyme Systems Products). Briefly, 50 μl of lysate was mixed with 50 μl of 2 × reaction buffer (200 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 40% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Lysates were transferred to dark walled 96-well plates (BD) and caspase 8 flurometric substrate Ac-IETD-AFC (Enzyme Systems Products) was added at a 1 mm concentration. Fluorescence was recorded at 400 nm excitation and 530 nm emission using a Packard Fluorometer. Values obtained from three independent experiments were averaged and fluorescence intensity was plotted as arbitrary units. To study genes induced by activation of cell death receptors we used a 9984 element (10,000) cDNA microarray consisting of ∼5996 known, named genes and 2674 ESTs (Unigene Build 136) (26Dhanasekaran M.S. Barrette T.R. Ghosh D. Shah R. Varambally S. Kurachi K. Pienta K. Rubin M.A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Nature. 2001; 412: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar). Fluorescently labeled (Cy5) cDNA was prepared from total RNA from each experimental sample. A specific reference sample was paired with each experimental sample and labeled with a second distinguishable fluorescent dye (Cy3). Fig.1 is an Eisen matrix representation that provides an overview of the 35 different experimental samples analyzed and includes: various control hybridizations (Fig. 1, columns 5, 7–10, and 21 and 22), MCF7 and SUM149 cells treated with TRAIL (Fig. 1, columns 1–4, 6, 11–15, and20) or with other death inducing agents including TNF, αFasAb, or TWEAK (Fig. 1, columns 16–19), MCF7-FADD-DN cells treated with various death ligands (Fig. 1, columns 23–26), and cells treated with interferon-α, -β, or -γ (Fig. 1, columns 27–35). A hierarchical clustering algorithm was employed to group genes based on similarity in gene expression across all the samples tested (28Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13268) Google Scholar). Coordinated patterns of gene expression mediated by these cytokines were evident and selected clusters will be dissected in detail. The entire dataset presented in Fig. 1 is available in the Supplementary Material. To focus on primary response genes induced by TRAIL in breast carcinoma cells, we used cycloheximide (CHX) to block protein synthesis, thereby inhibiting secondary and tertiary responses. CHX alone does not induce significant apoptosis in either MCF7 or SUM149 cells, in the time frame assessed (data not shown). As extended treatment with TRAIL causes induction of apoptosis in these cell lines (TRAIL, at 1000 ng/ml, significantly increases apoptosis within 3 and 5 h in SUM149 and MCF7 cells, respectively), we used the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VADfmk (zVAD) to block cell death, allowing for the study of gene expression alterations independent of apoptosis. While CHX and zVAD alter the expression of a limited set of genes, these changes were outside of the death ligand-specific response clusters (Fig. 1,columns 7–10 and 21 and 22). Furthermore, zVAD and CHX mediated effects were negated by using these agents in the specific reference samples used for microarray analysis. Analysis of gene expression in breast cancer cells treated with TRAIL revealed, primarily, “up-regulation” of specific gene products. While selected genes were down-regulated (as evident in Fig. 1), they are not presented here and are included in the Supplementary Material. Our analysis of a time course of TRAIL-treated MCF7 cells revealed three distinct clusters of up-regulated genes. In the “early” primary response cluster, genes were up-regulated between 1 and 4 h and declined to normal levels thereafter (Fig.2, A, top panel, andB). The “intermediate” cluster was comprised of genes that were up-regulated at the 4-h time point and remained elevated (Fig. 2, A, middle panel, and C). Finally, the “late” cluster contained genes that were up-regulated at 16 h and beyond (Fig. 2, A, bottom panel, and D). We next considered each cluster in some detail. The early cluster of TRAIL-induced genes (Fig. 2B) includes an activator of immediate early genes HCFC-1 (30Wysocka J. Reilly P.T. Herr W. Mol. Cell.

Mutations in theATP7B gene lead to copper accumulation in a number of tissues and to a severe multisystem disorder, known as Wilson's disease. Primary sequence analysis suggests that the copper-transporting ATPase ATP7B or the Wilson's disease protein (WNDP) belongs to the large family of cation-transporting P-type ATPases, however, the detailed characterization of its enzymatic properties has been lacking. Here, we developed a baculovirus-mediated expression system for WNDP, which permits direct and quantitative analysis of catalytic properties of this protein. Using this system, we provide experimental evidence that WNDP has functional properties characteristic of a P-type ATPase. It forms a phosphorylated intermediate, which is sensitive to hydroxylamine, basic pH, and treatments with ATP or ADP. ATP stimulates phosphorylation with an apparent Km of 0.95 ± 0.25 μm; ADP promotes dephosphorylation with an apparent Kmof 3.2 ± 0.7 μm. Replacement of Asp1027with Ala in a conserved sequence motif DKTG abolishes phosphorylation in agreement with the proposed role of this residue as an acceptor of phosphate during the catalytic cycle. Catalytic phosphorylation of WNDP is inhibited by the copper chelator bathocuproine; copper reactivates the bathocuproine-treated WNDP in a specific and cooperative fashion confirming that copper is required for formation of the acylphosphate intermediate. These studies establish the key catalytic properties of the ATP7B copper-transporting ATPase and provide a foundation for quantitative analysis of its function in normal and diseased cells.

Menkes disease protein Wilson's disease protein 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol bathocuproine disulfonate tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride P-type ATPases form a large family of membrane proteins found in all living organisms from bacteria to man (1Scarborough G.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 517-522Google Scholar, 2Palmgren M.G. Axelsen K.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 37-45Google Scholar, 3Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Google Scholar). The major function of these proteins is to couple the energy of ATP hydrolysis with the uphill transport of a variety of cations across cell membranes. The P-type ATPases share several highly conserved sequence motifs, most of which are located in the ATP-hydrolyzing domain of these proteins (Fig.1). For several members of the family, it has been shown that the invariant Asp residue in the DKTG motif accepts γ-phosphate from ATP during the catalytic cycle, forming a covalent acylphosphate intermediate (see for example, Refs. 4Post R.L. Kume S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6993-7000Google Scholar, 5Bastide F. Meissner G. Fleischer S. Post R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 8385-8391Google Scholar, 6Dame J.B. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 28620-28627Google Scholar). The formation of a phosphorylated intermediate is a signature property of these transporters, which also gave the name to this family. More than 150 members of the P-type ATPase family have been identified. Current classification divides the P-type ATPases into 5 subfamilies based on their sequence, cation specificity, membrane topology, and presence of various regulatory domains (2Palmgren M.G. Axelsen K.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 37-45Google Scholar). Among these diverse molecular machines, ATPases involved in the transport of copper form one of the most intriguing and least characterized groups. The first mammalian copper-transporting ATPases were identified as the result of a search for genes affected in patients with disorders of copper metabolism, i.e. Menkes disease and Wilson's disease (9Vulpe C. Levinson B. Whitney S. Packman S. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 7-13Google Scholar, 10Tanzi R.E. Petrukhin K. Chernov I. Pellequer J.L. Wasco W. Ross B. Romano D.M. Parano E. Pavone L.

Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 271-277Google Scholar). Menkes disease is caused by various mutations or deletions in the gene ATP7A and is associated with overall copper deficiency due to impaired export of copper from intestinal cells. Wilson's disease, in contrast, is caused by copper accumulation predominantly in the liver, brain, and kidneys as a result of mutations in the ATP7B gene. The Menkes disease protein (MNKP)1 and Wilson's disease protein (WNDP) are homologous and both contain sequence motifs characteristic of the P-type ATPases. Both WNDP and MNKP, as well as their numerous homologues from other organisms belong to the P1-subfamily of cation-transporting P-type ATPases. This family is characterized by their selectivity toward soft and transition metals and by the presence of metal-binding sites in the N-terminal region of the protein, 8 transmembrane segments (6 segments before, and 2 segments after the ATP-binding domain, Fig.1), the conserved CP(C/H) motif in the transmembrane segment 6, and SEHPL sequence located in the ATP-binding domain downstream of the putative phosphorylation site DKTG (3Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Google Scholar, 13Solioz M. Vulpe C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 237-241Google Scholar). Very few, predominantly bacterial, members of the P1-subfamily have been functionally characterized (see, for example, Refs. 7Okkeri J. Haltia T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14109-14116Google Scholar, 14Rensing C. Fan B. Sharma R. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 652-656Google Scholar, and15Tsai K.J. Linet A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 267-270Google Scholar). The ability of MNKP and WNDP to transport copper has been demonstrated (8Voskoboinik I. Mar J. Strausak D. Camakaris J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28620-28627Google Scholar, 17Voskoboinik I. Brooks H. Smith S. Shen P. Camakaris J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 178-182Google Scholar, 18Hung I.H. Suzuki M. Yamaguchi Y. Yuan D.S.

(8Voskoboinik I. Mar J. Strausak D. Camakaris J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28620-28627Google Scholar,20Voskoboinik I. Greenough M. La Fontaine S. Mercer J.F. Camakaris J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 966-970Google Scholar) confirmed that copper transport by these proteins is ATP-dependent. Further characterization of MNKP indicated that this protein formed a phosphorylated intermediate in a manner similar to other P-type ATPases (8Voskoboinik I. Mar J. Strausak D. Camakaris J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28620-28627Google Scholar). The enzymatic properties of WNDP have not yet been described. Earlier we isolated and provided detailed biochemical characterization of two major functional domains of WNDP, the copper-binding domain and the ATP-binding domain (21Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Google Scholar, 22Tsivkovskii R. MacArthur B.C. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2234-2242Google Scholar). In the present work we evaluate functional characteristics of the full-length WNDP utilizing baculovirus-infected insect cells, a system previously optimized for expression of Na,K-ATPase, a P2-type ATPase (23Hu Y.K. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19185-19191Google Scholar). Using this approach we were able to obtain a high yield expression of the full-length WNDP and analyze its major functional properties. The 4.4-kb fragment containing the full-length WNDP cDNA was excised from the pMT2-WNDP plasmid using digestion with the restriction nuclease SalI and partial digestion with EcoRI (partial digestion withEcoRI was required due to the presence of anotherEcoRI site inside the WNDP cDNA sequence). The obtained fragment was cloned into the pFastBacDual vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA) digested with the same enzymes and was placed under the control of the polH promoter. The resultant plasmid pFastBacDual-WNDP (pWNDP) was then utilized to generate the recombinant WNDP-expressing baculovirus using the commercially available Bac-to-Bac kit (Invitrogen) and previously described protocols (23Hu Y.K. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19185-19191Google Scholar). DH10 Bac cells were transformed with pWNDP and allowed to generate bacmids via a transposition mechanism as previously described (24Luckow V.A. Lee S.C. Barry G.F. Olins P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4566-4579Google Scholar). The WNDP bacmids were then used to transfect Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9) cells and produce baculovirus expressing WNDP. Baculovirus was amplified as described in the Bac-to-BacTM manual and in Ref. 23Hu Y.K. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19185-19191Google Scholar. The D1027A mutant of WNDP was generated by polymerase chain reaction. The oligonucleotides, 5′-GTTTGCCAAGACTGGCACCAT-3′ and 5′-TGGTGCCAGTCTTGGCAAACATC-3′, were used as forward and reverse primers, respectively, to introduce the mutation and the 5′-TGTGCATTGCCTGCCCCT-3′ and 5′-ACCACAGCCAGAACCTTC-3′ oligonucleotides were used as a forward and reverse flanking primers. Following PCR, the fragment containing the D1027A mutation was digested with the XcmI and Bsu36I restriction endonucleases and the XcmI-Bsu36I fragment was exchanged with the corresponding fragment of the wild-type WNDP cloned into the pFastBacDual plasmid. The presence of the D1027A mutation in the final construct and the absence of the unwanted mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Sf9 cells (Invitrogen) were maintained at 27 °C in 150-ml suspension cultures in the Ex-CellTM 420 growth medium (JRH Biosciences Inc., Lenexa, KS) and were split every 2–3 days with fresh medium to maintain cell densities between 0.5 × 106 and 4 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were infected with recombinant virus as previously described (23Hu Y.K. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19185-19191Google Scholar, 25Gatto C. McLoud S.M. Kaplan J.H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C982-992Google Scholar), and harvested 3 days post-infection. To obtain a total membrane preparation, the cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min and cell pellet was frozen at −20 °C and then thawed to facilitate lysis. Cells from a 50-ml culture were pelleted and resuspended in 4 ml of homogenizing buffer (HB): 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol (1 tablet of Roche complete protease inhibitor mixture was added per 50 ml of buffer solution). Cell were lysed by a 20-stock homogenization in a Dounce homogenizer, and then centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g. The pellet was discarded and the soluble fraction was subjected to an additional centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 × g to sediment cell membranes. The pelleted cell membranes were then resuspended in 0.5 ml of HB and stored frozen at −80 °C until further use. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar). To analyze protein expression 1 μg of total membrane protein was separated by a 7.5% Laemmli gel (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane using 10 mm CAPS, pH 11, 10% methanol, and stained with polyclonal antibody a-ABD (1:20,000 dilution) directed against the central region of WNDP (22Tsivkovskii R. MacArthur B.C. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2234-2242Google Scholar). To test subcellular localization of WNDP, the total membrane preparation was fractionated using a discontinuous five-step sucrose gradient and analyzed by Western blotting, as previously described (23Hu Y.K. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19185-19191Google Scholar, 25Gatto C. McLoud S.M. Kaplan J.H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C982-992Google Scholar). In several experiments, a baculovirus construct expressing both the α and β subunits of the Na,K-ATPase was used as a control. The construct was generated using the pFastBacDual vector, in which the α subunit of Na,K-ATPase was placed under the control of the p10 promoter while the β subunit was expressed from the polH promoter. The expression of Na,K-ATPase was carried out using previously described protocols (23Hu Y.K. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19185-19191Google Scholar, 25Gatto C. McLoud S.M. Kaplan J.H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C982-992Google Scholar). Analysis of protein expression was performed by Western blotting using a mouse anti-Na,K-ATPase α-1 antibody (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc., Golden, CO). 50 μg of total membrane protein was resuspended in 200 μl of the assay buffer: 20 mm bis-Tris propane, pH 6.0, 200 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2. Radioactive [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi, specific activity 20 mCi/μmol) was added to a final concentration of 1 μm and the reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 4 min or for various time periods in the case of kinetic measurements. All additional treatments were done as described in the figure legends. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of ice-cold 1 mmNaH2PO4 in 50% trichloroacetic acid and then centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g. The protein pellet was washed once with ice-cold water and resuspended in 40 μl of sample buffer (5 mm Tris-PO4, pH 5.8, 6.7m urea, 0.4 m dithiothreitol, 5% SDS) and loaded on the acidic 7.5% polyacryalmide gel (28Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Foldes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid for 10 min and dried on a blotting paper. The dried gels were exposed either overnight to the Molecular Imaging screen CS (Bio-Rad) or for several hours at −80 °C to the Kodak BioMax MS film and the intensity of the bands was quantified using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager or Bio-Rad densitometer, respectively. Then, the dried gels were re-hydrated, stained with Coomassie, and the amount of protein in the WNDP-related bands was determined by a second round of densitometry. The32P incorporation into WNDP was then normalized to the WNDP protein levels. Phosphorylation of Na,K-ATPase and analysis of32P incorporation was carried out identically, with the exception that the phosphorylation buffer contained 150 mmNaCl instead of KCl. Human hepatoma (HepG2) cells were grown in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 0.1 mm minimal essential medium, nonessential amino acids, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (basal medium) in a 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% air incubator. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml of penicillin-streptomycin (all from Invitrogen) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For transfection with the pMT2-WNDP plasmid, COS-7 cells at 50–70% confluency were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline and treated for 45 min under growth conditions with DNA/DEAE-dextran solution: 2 μg of plasmid DNA, 250 μg of DEAE-dextran (Amersham Bioscience, Inc., Peapack, NJ) per 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then incubated in growth medium containing 57 μg/ml chloroquine (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) for 3 h under growth conditions. Next, the cells were treated with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide in phosphate-buffered saline for 1.5 min and then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. Growth medium was added and the cells were grown under normal conditions for 24–36 h. To compare protein expression, cells grown on a 15-cm plate (HepG2 at 90–95% confluence and COS-7 cell 24 h after transfection) were scraped in 4 ml of HB buffer using rubber “policeman” and thoroughly resuspended. Cells were then homogenized and membrane fractions were prepared as described above for the insect cells. Membrane preparations from insect cells expressing WNDP or Na,K-ATPase were resuspended in the respective phosphorylation buffers to a protein concentration of 0.25 mg/ml and then incubated on ice with increasing concentrations of the copper chelator BCS for 15 min. BCS was then removed by sedimentation of the reaction mixture at 20,000 × g for 5 min, the pellets were resuspended in the respective phosphorylation buffer, and analysis of phosphorylation from ATP was carried out as described above. For metal reactivation experiments, ascorbate alone or ascorbate with tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP, Sigma) were added to the membrane protein to a final concentration of 100 μm each before addition of BCS. Following a 15-min incubation of the membrane preparation with 100 μm BCS, the chelator was removed by centrifugation as described above. The membrane pellets were resuspended in the phosphorylation buffer containing either ascorbate or ascorbate with TCEP and increasing concentrations of CuCl2 (or ZnCl2 and CdCl2 at 4 or 20 μm) were added to the mixture. Following 10 min incubation on ice the radioactive ATP was added and the phosphorylation reaction and analysis of 32P incorporation were carried out as described above. The data were analyzed by a nonlinear regression using SigmaPlot software. The highest r2 values were obtained using either sigmoidal function,y=a1+e−x−xobEquation 1 (r2 = 0.99) or Hill equationy=axncn+xnEquation 2 where n was 2.6 ± 0.6 (r2 = 0.98). TheATP7B gene encoding human copper-transporting ATPase WNDP was characterized several years ago (29Petrukhin K. Lutsenko S. Chernov I. Ross B.M. Kaplan J.H. Gilliam T.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1647-1656Google Scholar), however, analysis of the WNDP enzymatic properties has been hindered by very low levels of endogenous protein (∼0.005% of total cell membrane protein), and by insufficient levels of expression of WNDP following transfection of mammalian cells. Currently, the most frequently used system for analysis of WNDP and its disease-related mutants utilizes a yeast strain, in which the endogenous copper-transporting ATPase CCC2 has been deleted (30Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Google Scholar). Deletion of CCC2 disrupts copper delivery to the secretory compartment and renders the copper-dependent ferroxidase Fet3 inactive, while expression of WNDP restores the Fet3 activity to some extent (18Hung I.H. Suzuki M. Yamaguchi Y. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21461-21466Google Scholar, 31Iida M. Terada K. Sambongi Y. Wakabayashi T. Miura N. Koyama K. Futai M. Sugiyama T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 281-285Google Scholar). This elegant assay permits rapid screening of mutants (32Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 1663-1674Google Scholar), however, the indirect nature of the assay prevents characterization of the molecular mechanism of WNDP. The recently reported expression of WNDP in Chinese hamster ovary cells does permit direct analysis of copper transport (20Voskoboinik I. Greenough M. La Fontaine S. Mercer J.F. Camakaris J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 966-970Google Scholar), however, the low level of protein expression makes other measurements difficult. To overcome these problems we constructed a donor plasmid for baculovirus-mediated expression of WNDP (Fig.1B) and tested expression of WNDP in Sf9 cells. As shown in Fig.2A, infection ofSf9 cells with baculovirus containing WNDP cDNA leads to a time-dependent appearance of the 165-kDa protein, which reacts with the WNDP-specific antibody on a Western blot. We also detected an additional 140-kDa band, which is likely to represent a proteolytic fragment of WNDP, since the amount of the 140-kDa band can be minimized using a protease inhibitors mixture. Comparison of WNDP expressed in Sf9 cells with endogenous WNDP present in hepatocytes (HepG2) and with WNDP expressed in COS-7 cells demonstrated that the yield of WNDP per mg of membrane protein in Sf9 cells was about 20-fold higher than in COS cells and about 400-fold higher than in HepG2 cells (Fig.2B). WNDP represents ∼2% of the membrane protein inSf9 cells and this amount of WNDP is sufficiently high to allow its visualization by standard Coomassie staining (Fig.2C). The apparent molecular mass of the heterologously expressed WNDP corresponds to that of endogenous protein in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2B). In addition to the high level of protein expression, another important advantage of expression in insect cells is the relative ease with which cell membranes can be fractionated. Centrifugation using a 5-step sucrose gradient permits separation of endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and plasma membrane (23Hu Y.K. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19185-19191Google Scholar, 25Gatto C. McLoud S.M. Kaplan J.H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C982-992Google Scholar). Therefore, we utilized this procedure to evaluate the subcellular distribution of the expressed WNDP. As shown in Fig. 3, the major portion of WNDP is found in the Golgi fraction in agreement with its known primary localization in mammalian cells (33Schaefer M. Hopkins R.G. Failla M.L. Gitlin J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G639-646Google Scholar, 34La Fontaine S. Theophilos M.B. Firth S.D. Gould R. Parton R.G. Mercer J.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 361-370Google Scholar, 35Roelofsen H. Wolters H. Van Luyn M.J. Miura N. Kuipers F. Vonk R.J. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 782-793Google Scholar). This distribution was different from the distribution of Na,K-ATPase, which was more abundant at the plasma membrane, the primary location of this transporter. A significant portion of WNDP was also seen in endoplasmic reticulum, its site of synthesis, where protein is likely to accumulate due to high levels of expression. Our later studies confirmed that WNDP protein in all fractions is functional, consequently un-fractionated membrane preparations were used for most of the experiments described below. The P-type ATPases are known to bind ATP and form an acylphosphate intermediate during their catalytic cycle. The characteristic properties of this intermediate are its sensitivity to treatment with hydroxylamine at neutral pH, sensitivity to basic pH, the transient nature of the intermediate, and reversibility of the reaction. To test whether WNDP can form an acylphosphate intermediate, the cell membranes were incubated with 1 μm [γ-32P]ATP and incorporation of 32P into protein was monitored using an acidic gel electrophoresis (28Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Foldes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, A andB, WNDP incorporates γ-phosphate from ATP, while no radioactive band was present in the lane with a control membrane fraction obtained from the cells mock-infected with the virus lacking WNDP (compare lanes 1 and 2). Further characterization of phosphorylated WNDP revealed that phosphorylation is hydroxylamine sensitive (Fig. 4, A and B,lane 4), unstable at pH 7 (Fig. 4, A andB, lane 5), and transient, as indicated by the effect of cold ATP (Fig. 4, A and B, lane 3). ADP at 1 mm concentration apparently reverses the phosphorylation (Fig. 4, A and B, comparelanes 6 and 7), in agreement with the known properties of other P-type ATPases. WNDP was originally assigned to the family of P-type ATPases because of the presence in its structure of several signature motifs, including the DKTG sequence with an invariant aspartate residue 1027. Substitution of this aspartate with alanine abolishes phosphorylation of WNDP (Fig. 4C), suggesting that Asp1027 is indeed a target of catalytic phosphorylation. It should be noted that the D1027A substitution does not have a negative effect on protein expression in insect cells (see Fig. 4), and in COS-7 cells the expression level of mutant was consistently higher than the level of the wild-type protein (not shown). Finally, analysis of the rate of formation of phosphorylated WNDP revealed that t½ for this reaction is about 30 s and that maximal phosphorylation is achieved in 3–4 min (Fig. 5). Therefore, in subsequent experiments the time of the reaction was set at 4 min. We have previously isolated the ATP-binding domain of WNDP and characterized its nucleotide-binding properties (22Tsivkovskii R. MacArthur B.C. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2234-2242Google Scholar), however, the nucleotide binding characteristics of the full-length copper-transporting ATPase remained unknown. Consequently, we utilized the phosphorylation assay to assess the apparent affinity of the full-length WNDP for ATP. As shown in Fig.6A, phosphorylation of WNDP is ATP-dependent with a Km for ATP equal to 0.95 ± 0.25 μmol. This value is in agreement with values reported earlier for the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of other P-type ATPases (for example, a Km of 0.5 μm was observed for Na,K-ATPase, Ref. 36Post R.L. Sen A.K. Rosental A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 240: 1437-1446Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Km for ATP observed in our experiments was significantly lower than the Km for ATP determined for the homologous Menkes disease ATPase (17 ± 7 μm) using an ATP-dependent copper transport assay (8Voskoboinik I. Mar J. Strausak D. Camakaris J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28620-28627Google Scholar). As predicted for a P-type ATPase, the hydrolysis of ATP by WNDP is reversible and the phosphorylated intermediate formed from ATP is sensitive to the addition of ADP (see Fig. 4 above). To characterize the reverse reaction in more detail, we determined the dependence of dephosphorylation on the concentration of ADP. As shown in Fig.6B, ADP robustly dephosphorylates WNDP with an apparentKm of 3.2 ± 0.7 μmol. The ease with which ADP dephosphorylates WNDP suggests that following phosphorylation from ATP, WNDP is stabilized in a conformation particularly suitable for ADP binding. The presence of a transported cation in the reaction buffer is required for efficient catalytic phosphorylation of various P-type ATPases, therefore we analyzed whether copper can stimulate phosphorylation of WNDP. From the studies shown above, it appears that addition of copper is not required to generate a phosphorylated intermediate of WNDP. Furthermore, additions of copper to the reaction mixture did not stimulate phosphorylation of WNDP. 2R. Tsivkovskii, J. F. Eisses, J. H. Kaplan, and S. Lutsenko, unpublished data. We hypothesized that trace amounts of copper present in the cell growth medium and in buffers (about 1–1.5 μm)2 were sufficient to fully activate WNDP. This idea is not unreasonable, since intracellular concentrations of copper are expected to be extremely low (in yeast <10−18m (37Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Google Scholar)). We therefore tested whether chelation of copper in the medium with the copper chelators, bicinchoninic acid and bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS), would have an effect on catalytic phosphorylation of WNDP. Addition of either bicinchoninic acid or BCS to the reaction mixturein vitro or addition of 50 μm BCS to the WNDP-expressing cells 12 h prior to harvesting markedly decreased the level of WNDP phosphorylation, supporting our hypothesis2 (see Fig. 7 for details on the in vitro experiments). To verify that the effect of chelator is specific and is due to copper removal we compared phosphorylation of WNDP and Na,K-ATPase, a copper-independent P-type ATPase. As shown in Fig. 7, BCS had essentially no inhibitory effect on phosphorylation of Na,K-ATPase, while phosphorylation of WNDP was markedly decreased in the presence of BCS (Km for BCS is 50 μm). These results pointed to the important role of copper in catalytic phosphorylation of W"

Paralysed patients may benefit from the development of an implantable brain–computer interface device that can bypass damaged motor pathways1,2,3. But it is unclear whether chronically de-efferented areas will still be sufficiently excitable to respond to motor attempts4,5 if the motor cortex has been extensively reorganized6,7, and, if they are, whether this excitability is somatotopically organized8,9. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging to study brain activity in subjects with spinal-cord injuries while they are executing, or attempting to execute, movements of different limbs. We show that their motor-cortical activation closely follows normal somatotopic organization in the primary and non-primary sensorimotor areas. Our results indicate that any reorganization of the motor system that does occur in these patients does not affect attempt-related activation, and that it should be possible to access voluntary control signals by using a cortical neuroprosthetic."

These two independent pathways converge on the same set of genomic cis-elements within the AS promoter, which are referred to as nutrient-sensing response element (NSRE)-1 and -2, both of which are absolutely necessary for gene activation. The NSRE-1 sequence was used to identify the corresponding transcription factor by yeast one-hybrid screening. Based on those results, electrophoretic mobility shift assays for individual CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (C/EBP) family members were performed to test for supershifting of complexes by specific antibodies. The results indicated that of all the family members, C/EBPβ bound to the NSRE-1 sequence to the greatest extent and that the absolute amount of this complex was increased when extracts from amino acid- or glucose-deprived cells were tested. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, mutation of the NSRE-1 sequence completely prevented formation of the C/EBPβ-containing complexes. In contrast, mutation of the NSRE-2 sequence did not block C/EBPβ binding. Overexpression in HepG2 hepatoma cells of the activating isoform of C/EBPβ increased AS promoter-driven transcription, whereas the inhibitory dominant-negative isoform of C/EBPβ blocked enhanced transcription following amino acid or glucose deprivation.

With regard to the latter, asparagine starvation, induced by administration of the enzyme l-asparaginase, is included in all accepted protocols for the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (5Amylon M.D. Shuster J.

Leukemia (Baltimore). 1999; 13: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, the impact of amino acid availability on the control of fundamental cellular processes is just beginning to be investigated extensively (reviewed in Refs. 6Jousse C. Bruhat A. Fafournoux P. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 1999; 2: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar and 7Fafournoux P. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). A number of laboratories have identified specific mRNAs, proteins, and cellular activities that are induced following amino acid deprivation (reviewed in Refs. 7Fafournoux P. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar and 8Laine R.O. Hutson R.G. Kilberg M.S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 53: 219-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). An example is asparagine synthetase (AS),1 which catalyzes the glutamine- and ATP-dependent conversion of aspartic acid to asparagine. Nearly 2 decades ago, Arfin et al. (9Arfin S.M. Simpson D.R. Chiang C.S. Andrulis I.L. Hatfield G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2367-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 10Andrulis I.L. Hatfield G.W. Arfin S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10629-10633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that asparagine starvation of Chinese hamster ovary cells decreases the level of asparaginyl-tRNAAsn, and subsequently, AS enzymatic activity increases; refeeding these cells asparagine rapidly reverses this response. Induction of the AS activity also occurs in temperature-sensitive Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants for asparaginyl-, leucyl-, methionyl-, and lysyl-tRNA synthetases (10Andrulis I.L. Hatfield G.W. Arfin S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10629-10633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these data, starvation of HeLa or HepG2 hepatoma cells for any one of a number of individual amino acids causes the accumulation of AS mRNA, documenting that this nutrient-sensing mechanism broadly detects amino acid availability (11Gong S.S. Guerrini L. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6059-6066Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Hutson R.G. Kilberg M.S. Biochem.

(14Guerrini L. Gong S.S. Mangasarian K. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3202-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) were the first to document the presence of a genomic element, within the human AS promoter, that mediates amino acid-dependent regulation of transcription. Using deletion analysis and scanning mutagenesis in conjunction with transient transfection, these authors identified a region from nt −70 to −62 that functions as an amino acid response element (AARE). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) using oligonucleotides containing this sequence documented the formation of specific protein-DNA complexes in vitro (14Guerrini L. Gong S.S. Mangasarian K. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3202-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The sequence within this region does not correspond precisely to a consensus sequence for any known transcription factors. Subsequently, Barbosa-Tessmann et al. (15Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Pineda V.L. Nick H.S. Schuster S.M. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the human AS gene is also induced by glucose deprivation and that this process is mediated by the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. Through the use of in vivo footprinting and single-nucleotide mutagenesis, it was demonstrated that the promoter sequence 5′-TGATGAAAC-3′ (nt −68 to −60), the region first identified by Guerrini et al. (14Guerrini L. Gong S.S. Mangasarian K. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3202-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), is also responsible for induction of the AS gene following activation of the UPR pathway (17Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UPR pathway activation demonstrates that this sequence serves in a broader capacity than simply as an AARE; and, to reflect this broader substrate-detecting capability, this sequence has been labeled nutrient-sensing response element (NSRE)-1. A second element (5′-GTTACA-3′, nt −48 to −43), 11 nucleotides downstream, is also absolutely required for activation of the gene by the nutrient-sensing response pathway (17Barbosa-Tessmann I.P.

The term nutrient-sensing response unit has been coined to describe the collective function of these sequences. The C/EBP homology protein (CHOP) is a member of the C/EBP family (18Ron D. Habener J.F. Gene. Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar), and Bruhat et al. (19Bruhat A. Jousse C. Wang X.-Z. Ron D. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 7192-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) have identified, within the promoter of the humanCHOP gene, a sequence (5′-TGATGCAAT-3′, nt −302, order to −310) that functions as an AARE and differs by only two nucleotides from the NSRE-1 sequence in the AS promoter. Although transcription from the CHOP gene is also induced by the UPR pathway, an NSRE-2 sequence is not present; and, unlike the AS gene, the CHOP promoter has a separate sequence (5′-CCAATCAGAAAGTGGCACG-3′, nt −75 to −93) that mediates the activation by the UPR pathway (21Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mechanisms for activation of these two genes by the amino acid response (AAR) and UPR pathways are distinct. Consistent with this proposal, Jousse et al. (13Jousse C. Bruhat A. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1555-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have documented that transcriptional control of a reporter gene driven by the AS and CHOP promoters responds differently when cells are deprived of selected individual amino acids. This study was designed to identify transcription proteins capable of binding to NSRE-1 of the AS promoter and to establish their role with regard to induction of the gene by the AAR and UPR pathways. Using the NSRE-1 sequence as bait, yeast one-hybrid screening indicated that members of the C/EBP family bind this element. Among the members of the C/EBP family, antibodies specific for C/EBPβ caused the greatest amount of a supershifted complex, and the abundance of this complex was increased when extracts from amino acid- or glucose-deprived cells were used. Mutation of individual nucleotides within the NSRE-1 sequence known to be critical for regulated transcription (16Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol.

Expression of the activating isoform (liver-enriched activating protein (LAP)) of C/EBPβ in HepG2 cells caused increased transcription from anAS promoter/luciferase reporter construct, whereas expression of the dominant-negative C/EBPβ isoform (liver-enriched inhibitory protein (LIP)) blocked transcriptional induction following activation of either the AAR or UPR pathway. Collectively, the results demonstrate that C/EBPβ binds in vitro to NSRE-1 within the human AS promoter and is able to regulate AS promoter-driven transcription in vivo. Human HepG2 hepatoma cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM), pH 7.4, supplemented with 25 mm NaHCO3, 4 mm glutamine, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 μg/ml penicillin G, 28.4 μg/ml gentamycin, 0.023 μg/mlN-butyl-p-hydroxybenzoate, 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 and 95% air incubator. HepG2 cells were cotransfected with a reporter plasmid composed of firefly luciferase (pGL3 vector, Promega, Madison, WI) driven by humanAS promoter sequence −115 to +1 and, where indicated, the pSCT vector containing either the activating (LAP) or dominant-negative (LIP) isoform of rat C/EBPβ, originally described by Descombes and Schibler (22Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar) and kindly provided by Dr. Harry S. Nick (University of Florida). Transfection efficiency was monitored by cotransfection with the Renilla luciferase reporter (phRL-SV40) driven by the SV40 promoter (Promega). The cells were transfected to 50–70% confluence in 24-well plates using the batch transfection technique described by Barbosa-Tessmann et al. (16Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31139-31144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). After transfection and a subsequent 24-h incubation in MEM, cells from each well were divided into multiple wells of a new 24-well plate and cultured for another 24 h prior to incubation for 12 h in complete MEM, histidine-free MEM, or glucose-free MEM, each supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (15Barbosa-Tessmann I.P.

In this way, cells incubated in the three different nutrient media arose from the same transfection. The firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were assayed by the dual-luciferase reporter system (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s directions. The data are expressed as the means ± S.D. of three to four assays, and each experiment was repeated with multiple batches of cells. Total cellular RNA was isolated using an RNeasy minikit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the procedure described by the supplier.32P-Radiolabeled cDNA probe synthesis and Northern analysis were performed as described by Aslanian et al. (23Aslanian A.M. Fletcher B.S. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The probe for C/EBPβ was the rat LIP isoform cDNA, which detected both transfected isoforms, as well as endogenous human C/EBPβ. A yeast one-hybrid screening system for the identification of DNA-binding proteins was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Three tandem copies of the NSRE-1 sequence (5′-GCAGGCATGATGAAACTTC-3′) were cloned in front of the minimal promoter within the two reporter vectors pHisi-1 and pLacZi and then used to produce the corresponding stably expressing yeast strains. These two cell lines permit a dual selection using HIS3 complementation for cell growth and β-galactosidase activity as a secondary screen for elimination of false positives. Following selection for stable transformants, the yeast strains were transformed with a human pancreatic cDNA library fused to the yeast Gal4 activation domain. Initial positives were isolated by growth on histidine-free medium containing 45 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole to reduce the background expression of HIS3 in the reporter strain. Colonies that grew in the absence of histidine were used to isolate specific clones, and then each of these clones was tested for activation of the pLacZi reporter gene by back-transformation of the appropriate yeast strain, followed by a β-galactosidase filter lift assay. All procedures were performed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HepG2 cells incubated for 16 h in complete MEM (control) or in MEM lacking glucose or histidine. Nuclear extracts were prepared from four 150-mm dishes of cells, and all steps were performed at 4 °C. The cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate and 0.9% sodium chloride, pH 7.5), collected by scraping in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline/dish, and then pelleted by centrifugation at 500 ×g for 10 min. After resuspension in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 1160 ×g for 5 min. To the pellet were added 600 μl of TM-2 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm magnesium chloride, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) and 4 μl of a protease inhibitor mixture stock solution (2 μg each of aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, N-tosylphenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, and N-tosyllysine chloromethyl ketone); Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.5%; and the mixture was incubated for an additional 5 min. The cells were lysed by gently passing through a 22-gauge needle three times and then centrifuged for 10 min at 130 × g. The supernatant was carefully removed and discarded, and then 300 μl of TM-2 buffer was added to the lower layer (nuclei) and gently mixed. The mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 130 × g, and the upper supernatant layer was discarded as before. To the lower layer containing the nuclei were added 800 μl of nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 400 mmsodium chloride, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.6) and 4 μl of the protease inhibitor mixture. The mixture was gently mixed by constant rotation for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 10 min. This mixture was dialyzed against dialysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm potassium chloride, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.8) overnight at 4 °C, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at −70 °C until used. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were32P-radiolabeled by extension of overlapping ends with Klenow fragment in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (24Kerrigan L.A. Kadonaga J.T. Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). An aliquot of nuclear extract (5 μg of protein) was preincubated for 20 min at 4 °C in a total volume of 20 μl containing 40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mmdithioerythritol, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 0.05 mm EDTA. Then 0.004 pmol of32P-radiolabeled probe (∼10,000 dpm) and, where indicated, unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides were added, and the incubation was continued for 20 min at room temperature. If antibody binding was to be tested, 4 μg (2 μl) of the indicated polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added, and an additional incubation for 20 min at room temperature was included. After electrophoresis for 2–3 h at 200V on a 5% polyacrylamide gel with a 15% cushion on the bottom 2 cm, the gel was dried, and the results were visualized by autoradiography. All experiments were repeated with at least two independently prepared nuclear extracts. To identify the transcription proteins that bound the NSRE-1 sequence, yeast one-hybrid screening was performed using three copies of the AS promoter NSRE-1 sequence placed in front of two independent reporter systems (HIS3 and LacZ) and a human pancreatic cDNA library fused to the Gal4 activation domain. A total of 2.51 × 106 colonies were screened for growth on histidine-free plates, and seven colonies were judged to be potential positives based on growth rate. DNA from each of the seven positives was isolated and used to perform a back-transformation. The positive colonies were then subjected to a β-galactosidase filter lift assay as a secondary screen. Three clones contained β-galactosidase activity that was much greater than the background level. These three positives were used to perform a back-transformation and confirmed that complementation of histidineindependent growth occurred. When these clones were sequenced, they were shown to have identity to the C/EBP family of transcription factors. EMSA was performed to determine which of the C/EBP family members were present in human HepG2 hepatoma cells and which had affinity for the NSRE-1 sequence. The radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe (oligonucleotide-1) corresponded to nt −79 to −53 within the human AS proximal promoter and therefore contained the NSRE-1 sequence (nt −68 to −60) (Fig.1). Incubation of the NSRE-1 probe with nuclear extract from cells cultured in complete MEM resulted in the formation of three primary complexes (denoted A–C in Fig.2), two of which were detected as faint broad bands, which are often difficult to detect in extracts from cells maintained in complete medium. Inclusion of an excess of the unlabeled NSRE-1 oligonucleotide completely eliminated formation of these three complexes, but also revealed the presence of a nonspecific complex as well (Fig. 2, lane 2). Formation of complexes A and C was blocked by the presence of an excess of an unlabeled oligonucleotide containing a C/EBP consensus sequence, but complex B remained (Fig. 2,lane 3). When extracts from cells cultured in the absence of histidine for 16 h were assayed, the amount of each of the specific complexes increased significantly, but the content of complex A was enhanced to the greatest extent (Fig. 2, compare lanes 4 and 10). To test for the binding of individual C/EBP family members, antibodies against C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, C/EBPε, and CHOP were screened for the ability to supershift these complexes. Antibodies specific for C/EBPα, C/EBPδ, C/EBPε, and CHOP each caused formation of one or more supershifted complexes (denoted by asterisks in Fig. 2), but the absolute amount of these complexes was relatively small in both fed and histidine-deprived cells. In contrast, the anti-C/EBPβ antibody caused the formation of two shifted complexes that were substantially increased when nuclear extracts from histidine-limited cells were tested (Fig. 2, comparelanes 6 and 12). It appeared that the primary complex shifted by the anti-C/EBPβ antibody was complex C (Fig. 2, compare lanes 4 and 6 or lanes 10 and 12). To show that the C/EBPβ-induced supershift was not cell-specific, experiments were performed using nuclear extracts from human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and similar results were obtained (data not shown).Figure 2EMSAs with the human AS promoter NSRE-1 sequence.

Using a 5–200-fold excess of the C/EBP-binding consensus sequence illustrated that complex C was blocked most effectively by the C/EBP sequence, followed by complex B. Complex A formation was the least affected, and a significant amount of the complex remained in the presence of a 200-fold excess of the C/EBP sequence (Fig. 3, lanes 8–12). Including the anti-C/EBPβ antibody illustrated that a 100-fold excess of either the NSRE-1 or C/EBP consensus sequence as an unlabeled competitor prevented formation of the supershifted complex (Fig. 3,lanes 13–15). Bruhat et al. (20Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Reimold A.M. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7192-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) have identified ATF-2 as a protein required for amino acid starvation-dependent induction of the CHOP gene. As mentioned above, the element within the CHOP promoter that is responsible for this regulation is similar to the NSRE-1 sequence in the AS promoter, but differs by two nucleotides. To determine whether ATF-2 bound to the AS NSRE-1 sequence in vitro, EMSAs were performed in conjunction with supershift assays using an antibody specific for ATF-2 (Figs. 4 and5). Although the protein-DNA complexes that are induced following histidine (Fig. 4) or glucose (Fig. 5) deprivation were clearly present, no shifted complexes were detectable after incubation with the anti-ATF-2 antibody with nuclear extracts from cells maintained in MEM (Fig. 4, compare lanes 3 and 4), histidine-deprived cells (Fig. 4, compare lanes 8 and 9), or glucose-deprived cells (Fig. 5, lane 6). Within the AS NSRE-1 sequence, there is a half-site (5′-ATGA-3′) for the c-Jun transcription factor, which can dimerize with c-Fos to form the activator protein-1 complex and can also associate with C/EBPβ (25Hsu W. Kerppola T.K. Chen P.L. Curran T. Chen-Kiang S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To investigate the possible binding of c-Fos or c-Jun to the NSRE-1 sequence, EMSAs were performed with or without antibodies specific for these two transcription proteins. No evidence could be obtained to suggest that either c-Fos or c-Jun was bound to the NSRE-1 sequence in either fed cells (Fig. 4, lanes 5–7) or histidine-deprived cells (lanes 10–12). These results are consistent with data published by Guerrini et al. (14Guerrini L. Gong S.S. Mangasarian K. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3202-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), who also concluded that this regulatory sequence within the AS promoter does not bind activator protein-1 complexes.Figure 5Formation of C/EBP β-containing complexes at the NSRE-1 sequence following activation of the UPR pathway by glucose deprivation. Nuclear extracts prepared from HepG2 cells maintained for 16 h in MEM lacking glucose (−Glc) were incubated with 32P-radiolabeled oligonucleotide-1 (see Fig. 1) to monitor formation of protein-DNA complexes. Lane 1 shows the complexes that remained if a 100-fold excess of an unlabeled, nonspecific (NS) sequence was added, and lane 2 illustrates the competition of the specific complexes by a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide-1 (Sp) itself.

Application of such sources to the study of atomic-scale motion requires efficient modulation of these beams on timescales ranging from nanoseconds to femtoseconds. However, ultrafast X-ray modulators are not generally available. Here we report efficient subnanosecond coherent switching of synchrotron beams by using acoustic pulses in a crystal to modulate the anomalous low-loss transmission of X-ray pulses. The acoustic excitation transfers energy between two X-ray beams in a time shorter than the synchrotron pulse width of about 100 ps. Gigahertz modulation of the diffracted X-rays is also observed. We report different geometric arrangements, such as a switch based on the collision of two counter-propagating acoustic pulses: this doubles the X-ray modulation frequency, and also provides a means of observing a localized transient strain inside an opaque material. We expect that these techniques could be scaled to produce subpicosecond pulses, through laser-generated coherent optical phonon modulation of X-ray diffraction in crystals. Such ultrafast capabilities have been demonstrated thus far only in laser-generated X-ray sources, or through the use of X-ray streak cameras."

The resulting 15S-hydroxyl group of prostaglandins is crucial for their bioactivity. Using human COX-1 and human and murine COX-2, we have identified two amino acids located in the oxygenase active site that control the stereochemistry at C-15. The most crucial determinant is Ser-530, the residue that is acetylated by aspirin. In COX-2, site-directed mutagenesis of Ser-530 to methionine, threonine, or valine produced highly active enzymes that formed 82–95% 15R-configuration prostaglandins; these have the opposite stereochemistry at C-15 to the natural products. In COX-1, the corresponding Ser-530 mutations inactivated the enzyme. The second residue, Val-349, exerts a more subtle influence. When Val-349 was replaced by isoleucine, the mutant COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes formed 41 and 65% 15R-prostaglandins, respectively. This change was highly specific for isoleucine, as mutations of Val-349 to alanine, leucine, asparagine, or threonine did not alter or only slightly altered (≤13%) the S-configuration at C-15. These results establish a previously unrecognized role for Ser-530 and Val-349 in maintaining the correct S stereochemistry of the carbon-15 hydroxyl group during prostaglandin synthesis.

Chem. 1967; 242: 5336-5343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An initial enzyme-catalyzed removal of the pro-S hydrogen from the 13-carbon of arachidonic acid sparks a series of radical reactions that lead in turn to oxygenation at C-11, bridging of the oxygen between C-11 and C-9 to form an endoperoxide, covalent linkage of C-8 and C-12 to form the 5-membered carbon ring, and, finally, stereospecific reaction with a second molecule of oxygen in the Sconfiguration at C-15. In the past 10 years, understanding the structural basis for control of these reactions by cyclooxygenase enzymes has been helped enormously by site-directed mutagenesis studies (3Gierse J.K.

Together, these data have helped elucidate the role of particular amino acids during the conversion of arachidonic acid to the prostaglandin product. Four highly conserved polar amino acid residues line the hydrophobic substrate binding channel in all cyclooxygenases (12Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2394) Google Scholar, 13Marnett L.J. Rowlinson S.W. Goodwin D.C. Kalgutkar A.S. Lanzo C.A. J. Biol.

Three of these residues are known to be involved in critical steps during the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin endoperoxide. Arg-120 and Tyr-355, located at the entrance of the COX active site, bind the carboxylate group of the arachidonic acid substrate (14Mancini J.A. Riendeau D. Falgueyret J.P. Vickers P.J. O'Neill G.P.

With the carboxylate anchored at the entrance, the carbon chain of arachidonic acid reaches up into the hydrophobic channel with carbon-13 placed opposite of Tyr-385. Tyr-385 initiates the oxygenation reaction by stereospecific removal of the pro-S hydrogen at C-13 of arachidonic acid (2Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4743-4746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A catalytically relevant role for the fourth polar residue, Ser-530, has not been described. Ser-530 is, however, well characterized for its pharmacological importance as the site of acetylation by aspirin (12Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev.

Normally, COX enzymes exert strict control over the stereochemistry of the reactions with molecular oxygen, resulting in exclusively 11R- and 15S-oxygenations in forming the prostaglandin endoperoxide. There are, however, three reported instances of highly specific 15R-oxygenations, opposite in configuration to the natural reaction of prostaglandin synthesis: (i) aspirin treatment of the COX-2 isozyme acetylates Ser-530, blocks prostaglandin synthesis, and switches the reaction specificity such that the enzyme forms exclusively the mono-hydroxy product, 15R-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15R-HETE) (17Holtzman M.J.

Characterization of the catalytic activity of the P. homomalla COX set an important precedent, namely that a cyclooxygenase enzyme is capable of forming prostaglandins with altered stereochemistry at C-15. These findings formed the impetus for the work reported here, the identification of active site residues that control the stereospecificity of the second oxygenation reaction at C-15. The normal 15S chirality is crucial for the biological activity of prostaglandins (22Nakano J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1972; 44: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Spraggins R.L. Tetrahedron Lett. 1972; 42: 4343-4346Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). From literature reports it was known that some of the active site mutations that induce an increased synthesis of 15R-HETE remain associated with the ability to form prostaglandins (5Thuresson E.D. Lakkides K.M. Rieke J.C. Sun Y. Wingerd B.A. Micielli R. Mulichak A.M. Malkowski M.G. Garavito R.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12387-12392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We inferred from this that Ser-530 is a potential determinant of prostaglandin stereochemistry at C-15. Furthermore, Val-349 is indicated by examination of the sequence of the 15R-COX of P. homomalla. Of the seven amino acid residues in the P. homomalla COX that are uniquely different from all other COX sequences, only one, the residue equivalent to Val-349 (changed to isoleucine in the P. homomalla enzyme), is predicted to impinge on the oxygenase active site (21Valmsen K. Järving I. Boeglin W.E. Varvas K. Koljak R. Pehk T. Brash A.R. Samel N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7700-7705Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this context, we set out to document the influence of Ser-530 and Val-349 on the control of C-15 stereochemistry in catalysis by three mammalian COX enzymes: human COX-1 and human and murine COX-2. [1-14C]Arachidonic acid was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Prostaglandin standards were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Racemic HETE standards were prepared by controlled autoxidation of arachidonic acid (25Peers K.F. Coxon D.T. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1983; 32: 49-56Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The cDNAs for human COX-1 and COX-2 were cloned by PCR, using cDNA prepared from human tonsils (26Schneider C. Keeney D.S. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 386: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Site-directed mutants of human COX-1 and COX-2 were produced using 43–47-nucleotide mutagenic oligonucleotides obtained from Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA) in a QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Site-directed mutants were selected by sequencing. For expression, wild-type and mutant human COX-1 plasmids were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Wild-type and mutant human COX-2 plasmids were expressed by transient transfection in HeLa cells using a recombinant virus containing the T7 RNA polymerase gene (27Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Expression levels of the wild-type and mutant human COX-1 and COX-2 were analyzed by Western blotting. 30 μg of protein from COS-7 cells or 20 μg of protein from HeLa cells were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Monoclonal antibodies raised against ovine COX-1 and a 20-amino acid peptide of human COX-2 from Cayman Chemical were used. Site-directed mutants of murine COX-2 were constructed with oligonucleotides purchased from Operon Technologies using molecular biology reagents obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) as outlined (4Rowlinson S.W. Crews B.C. Lanzo C.A. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23305-23310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells using the BaculoGold transfection kit (PharMingen, San Diego, CA), and purified by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography as described previously (4Rowlinson S.W. Crews B.C. Lanzo C.A. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23305-23310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). HeLa and COS-7 cells were harvested 24 and 48 h after transfection, respectively, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and sonicated for 5 s in incubation buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 containing 0.5 mm phenol and 1 μm hematin). Similar amounts of cells expressing wild-type and mutant enzymes were used in the incubations. One hundred μl of the cell lysate were incubated with 50 μm [1-14C]arachidonic acid at room temperature for 10 min. Protein was removed by precipitation with 250 μl of methanol and 125 μl of methylene chloride and subsequent centrifugation. After evaporation of the organic solvents, the products were recovered by extraction using a 100-mg Oasis HLB cartridge (Waters) essentially as described by Powell (28Powell W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 86: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Incubations with the purified wild-type and mutant murine COX-2 enzymes from Sf9 insect cell expressions were conducted in 200 μl of incubation buffer at 1–2 μm enzyme and 2–4 μm hematin concentration. 100 μm[1-14C]arachidonic acid was added and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Products were recovered as described above using a 100-mg Oasis HLB cartridge (Waters). For each mutant COX enzyme, the level of activity and the pattern of products on RP-HPLC were established in two or three separate experiments. In most cases, the peaks of products collected from RP-HPLC from a single experiment were further analyzed for the proportions of PGE diastereomers at C-15 and the chiralities of 11-HETE and 15-HETE. Product analysis was performed by RP-HPLC using a Waters Symmetry C18 5-μm column (0.46 × 25 cm) eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (37.5/62.5/0.01, by volume) for 15 min, then acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (70/30/0.01, by volume) for 15 min, and finally with methanol. Peaks were monitored using a HP 1040A diode array detector connected to a Packard A100 Flo-One Radiomatic liquid scintillation detector for detection of radiolabeled products. Unlabeled standards of HETEs (0.5 μg each) and PGE2 and PGD2 (2 μg each) were added prior to chromatography to facilitate UV detection of the peaks. Prostaglandin E2 and 15R-PGE2co-chromatographed on RP-HPLC and were collected as a single peak from the initial RP-HPLC system for further analysis. The solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. Separation of the diastereomers was achieved by SP-HPLC using an Alltech Econosil Si 5-μm column (0.46 × 25 cm) eluted with hexane/isopropanol/acetic acid (90/10/0.1, by volume) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Eluting radioactive products were detected using a HP 1040A diode array detector connected to a Packard A100 Flo-One Radiomatic liquid scintillation detector. 15- and 11-HETE were collected from the initial RP-HPLC system, methylated with ethereal diazomethane, and re-purified using SP-HPLC on a Whatman Partisil 5-μm column (25 × 0.46 cm) eluted with hexane/isopropanol/acetic acid (100/1/0.1, by volume) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and UV detection at 235 nm. Chiral phase HPLC analysis of 15-HETE and 11-HETE methyl esters was performed on a Chiralpak AD column as described (29Schneider C. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) using the diode array detector connected to the on-line liquid scintillation detector. In cases of low HETE formation, a more sensitive method of counting the radiolabeled products was used; fractions of 0.5 min were collected across the eluting peaks from the chiral phase HPLC, evaporated from solvent, mixed with scintillant, and counted for 14C content (10 min/sample) using a Packard Tri-Carb 1900 TR liquid scintillation analyzer. Wild-type and mutant COX enzymes were incubated with 50 μm[1-14C]arachidonic acid for 10 min, and the products were analyzed by RP-HPLC. PGE was the exclusive prostaglandin recovered from incubations with purified murine COX-2 and with human COX-2 expressed in HeLa cells (>95% PGE), whereas a mixture of PGF, PGE (∼50% of PG products), and PGD was formed in incubations with human COX-1 expressed in COS-7 cells. The differences in the PGH2degradation profile are likely caused by different endogenous prostaglandin endoperoxide-metabolizing activities present in the two cell types. PGE2 and its 15R-epimer co-chromatographed precisely on RP-HPLC and were collected as a single peak. Further chromatography of the mixture of PGE2 and 15R-PGE2 using SP-HPLC resulted in base-line resolution of the two diastereomers with retention times of 17 and 21 min for the 15R and 15S epimers, respectively, allowing exact quantification of their relative formation. In human COX-1, we replaced Ser-530 with threonine, methionine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine. All five mutants expressed in the COS-7 cells at levels similar to the wild-type human COX-1 as determined by Western analysis (data not shown). RP-HPLC analysis of incubations with [1-14C]arachidonic acid revealed no detectable product formation by any of the five mutants. This resembles the effect seen with aspirin-treated COX-1 enzymes, where acetylation of Ser-530 abrogates all oxygenase activity (12Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev.

Our results with Ser-530 mutations in human COX-1 differ from reported findings using ovine COX-1; in ovine COX-1 the S530T mutant retained oxygenase activity and was shown to form a significant amount of 15R-HETE (5Thuresson E.D.

In human COX-2, replacement of Ser-530 with threonine resulted in a COX enzyme with comparable oxygenase activity to the wild-type enzyme and with a similar product profile on RP-HPLC (Fig.2, A and B). Analysis of the main peak of PGE using SP-HPLC indicated that, although the wild-type COX-2 produced exclusively PGE2(15S), the S530T mutant produced 96% 15R-PGE2 and only 4% PGE2(15S) (Fig. 3, Aand B). Thus, the substitution of Ser-530 with threonine almost completely reversed the configuration of the prostaglandin product at C-15. The other difference noted was a slight change in the HETE by-products, which are described in the last section of Results. The S530M and S530V human COX-2 formed smaller proportions of PGE, with 15-HETE appearing as the major product (Fig. 2, C andD). In the S530M mutant, the peak of PGE consisted of 87% 15R-PGE2 (Fig. 3C). In the S530V mutant COX-2, the configuration was 82% 15R-PGE2 (Fig. 3D).Figure 3SP-HPLC analysis of PGE2 and 15R-PGE2 formed by wild-type and mutant human COX-2.A, wild-type; B, S530T;C, S530M; D, S530V.

The radiolabeled peak co-chromatographing with PGE2 was collected from the initial RP-HPLC system (Fig. 2) and analyzed by SP-HPLC using an Alltech Econosil Si 5-μm column eluted with a solvent of hexane/isopropanol/acetic acid (90/10/0.1, by volume) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.

When Ser-530 in human COX-2 was replaced with the more bulky hydrophobic residues, leucine or isoleucine, the mutant enzymes showed no detectable oxygenase activity.Table IStereochemical analysis of PGE2, 11-HETE, and 15-HETE formed by wild-type and Ser-530 mutant COX-2PGE211-HETE15-HETE15S15R11S11R15S15R%%%Human COX-2 Wild-type>99>998614 S530T496—1-a—, not detected.1387 S530M1387—>99 S530V1882>99199Mouse COX-2 Wild-type>99>997228 S530M694—496 S530A955>996139Incubations of wild-type and mutant COX-2 with 50 or 100 μm [1-14C]arachidonic acid were conducted for 10 min at room temperature, extracted, and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-a —, not detected. Open table in a new tab Incubations of wild-type and mutant COX-2 with 50 or 100 μm [1-14C]arachidonic acid were conducted for 10 min at room temperature, extracted, and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In contrast to the mutation of Ser-530, there were only minor differences between COX-1 and COX-2 isozymes in the effects of point mutations to Val-349. Each responded similarly to corresponding mutations to Val-349, both in terms of the retention of oxygenase activity and the stereochemical configuration of the products. Examples of the RP-HPLC analysis of wild-type and mutant COX-1 enzymes are given in Fig. 4; as noted earlier, wild-type COX-1 expressed in COS-7 cells formed a mixture of prostaglandins with PGE as the dominant product (Fig.4A). When Val-349 in the human COX-1 was changed to isoleucine, a mixture of 15R and 15S configuration prostaglandins was formed. This is evident on the initial RP-HPLC analysis (Fig.4B) because of partial separation of the PGF and PGD diastereomers at C-15, whereas 15R-PGE2 and PGE2 co-chromatograph as a single peak as shown before. SP-HPLC analysis of the PGE quantified 41% 15R-PGE2 formed by the V349I COX-1 mutant. The corresponding numbers for the V349I mutants of human and murine COX-2 were 60 and 65% 15R-PGE2 (TableII).Table IIStereochemical analysis of PGE2, 11-HETE, and 15-HETE formed by Val-349 mutant COX-1 and COX-2PGE211-HETE15-HETE15S15R11S11R15S15R%%%Human COX-1 Wild-type>99>996733 V349I5941>992278 V349L8812—2-a—, not detected.5743 V349N919>99ND2-bND, not determined.

Open table in a new tab The incubations were conducted and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As evident from a comparison of panels A andC of Fig. 4, the product profile for the V349T mutant of human COX-1 is almost indistinguishable from the wild-type enzyme. The configuration at C-15 of the PGE formed by wild-type and V349T mutant human COX-1 was confirmed as 99% 15S stereochemistry by SP-HPLC analysis (Table II). The same result, >98% PGE2, was found with the V349T mutant of COX-2 (Table II). Replacement of Val-349 with asparagine in human COX-1 and COX-2 had minor effects on the C-15 stereochemistry, with the two mutant isozymes forming 91 and 88% PGE2, respectively. Leucine at position 349 changed the product profile in all three COX enzymes analyzed, and 15-HETE was a more prominent product (Fig.4D). PGE2 was mainly of the natural configuration in the V349L mutant COX: 88% in human COX-1, and 87% in human and murine COX-2. Additional mutations in murine COX-2 of residues Leu-531 and Ala-527, which reside near the entrance of the substrate binding channel, resulted in little or no effect on C-15 oxygenation stereospecificity in prostaglandin formation (L531I, <3% 15R oxygenation; A527V, <1% 15Roxygenation). Using the purified V349I mouse COX-2 enzyme, we examined the influence of the substrate concentration (using 2, 5, 15, 30, and 50 μm arachidonic acid) on the C-15 stereochemistry of the major PGE product. We found no concentration-dependent change in the ratio of 15R- versus15S-PGE2 nor in the ratio of 15R-versus 15S-HETE; at 2, 5, 15, 30, and 50 μm arachidonic acid, the results (percentage as 15R-PGE2) were 63%, 69%, 63%, 64%, and 61%, respectively. These results are in line with the findings of Thuressonet al. (30Thuresson E.D. Lakkides K.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8501-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), who reported that the stereochemistry of the 15-HETE by-product of ovine COX-1 was not influenced by the substrate concentration, although the different COX products (PGH2, 11-HETE, and 15-HETE) had different Michaelis constants. We also examined carefully for the possible formation of additional prostaglandin isomers using authentic standards and RP- and SP-HPLC analyses in comparison to the radiolabeled products of the mutant COX enzymes. In addition to authentic PGF2α, PGE2, and PGD2, we had available 15R-PGF2α, 15R-PGE2, 11β-PGF2α, 8-iso-PGF2α, and PGF2β; furthermore, the 5,6-trans and 13,14-cis isomers of PGA2, -E2, and -F2α are well established to separate from the usual prostaglandins on TLC or SP-HPLC (31Schneider W.P. Morge R.A. Henson B.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 6062-6066Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). With the exception of the minor isomer seen with the S530M human COX-2 (indicated with anasterisk in Fig. 3C), no products aside from 15S- and 15R-prostaglandins were observed in our experiments. Regarding the changes to Ser-530 (for which only COX-2 isozymes were active), mutations that led to a prominent formation of 15R-PG products are all associated with a change in the enantiomeric composition of the 15-HETE toward the 15R enantiomer. Although the wild-type COX-2 enzymes formed 72–86% 15S-HETE, the mutants of Ser-530 formed up to 99% 15R-HETE (Table I). Furthermore, in some cases the change toward formation of 15R prostaglandin products was associated with an enhanced synthesis of 15-HETE such that it became the major enzymatic product. This applied to the S530V and S530M mutants (Fig. 2, C and D). A clear exception was seen with the S530T mutant, in which a near complete switch to 15R-PGE2 synthesis was associated with no change in the abundance of 15-HETE (cf. Fig. 2, A andB), albeit with the typical greater proportion of 15R-HETE formed by the mutant enzyme. An additional difference noted with the S530T mutant was the absence of the usual 11-HETE by-product (Fig. 2B and Table I). The formation of 15R-HETE as the major product of the S530M and S530V mutants resembled the effect of acetylation of Ser-530 by aspirin in COX-2 enzymes except that the two mutants retained partial COX activity, and the prostaglandin product is mainly of the 15R-configuration. In an earlier report, the S530M mutant of human COX-2 was described to produce 15R-HETE and ∼90-fold lower levels of PGE2 compared with the wild-type enzyme (19Mancini J.A. O'Neill G.P. Bayly C. Vickers P.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Formation of the PGE product may have been underestimated in these experiments because of the use of an ELISA assay, which is likely to be less sensitive toward the 15R-PGE2epimer. In comparison to the S530 mutations, changes to V349 (active with both COX-1 and COX-2 isozymes) caused far less pronounced effects on the stereochemistry of both the prostaglandins and the 15-HETE. The V349I mutants, the only ones with substantial 15R-prostaglandin formation, gave a change from 67–86% 15S-HETE in the different wild-type isozymes to 61–78% 15R-HETE in the isoleucine mutants (Table II). With the other Val-349 mutations, in general there was a drift toward more 15R-HETE enantiomer compared with the wild-type, but never the quantitatively prominent effects seen with the Ser-530 mutations. The configuration of the 15-HETE was 63–67% 15S in the V349L mutant human COX-1 and COX-2 and in murine COX-2. Mutation of Val-349 to leucine has been described before, and the results for analysis of 15-HETE are in accord with the data reported here (30Thuresson E.D. Lakkides K.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8501-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). When 11-HETE synthesis was detectable, it was always 99% 11R in configuration (TablesI and II). No 11-HETE was detectable with the V349L mutants of the different COX isozymes. Of the numerous mutations of the active site of COX enzymes described to date, none was reported to alter the absolute configuration of any of the stereocenters in the prostaglandin product. The observed effects were limited to influences on substrate binding, inhibitor selectivity, or changes in the product profile by altering the ratio of prostaglandins to HETE by-products. Prior to the discovery of a 15R-specific COX in the coral P. homomalla(21Valmsen K. Järving I. Boeglin W.E. Varvas K. Koljak R. Pehk T. Brash A.R. Samel N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7700-7705Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the possibility of formation of 15R-configuration prostaglandins by a COX enzyme was not anticipated. Elucidation of the primary sequence of the 15R-COX also suggested a potential determinant of how COX enzymes maintain or control the correct configuration of the oxygenation reactions in prostaglandin synthesis. The studies reported here document the role of Ser-530 and Val-349 in controlling the configuration of prostaglandins at the 15-carbon, and show that subtle changes in these residues can invert the configuration of this oxygenation reaction. The results are summarized in Fig.5. The contribution of Ser-530 appears to be the more important because its replacement with methionine, threonine, or valine reversed the normal stereoselectivity at C-15, yielding enzymes that formed R-configuration prostaglandins with high stereoselectivity. Only COX-2 would tolerate these mutations of Ser-530, the results with human COX-1 being inactivated enzymes. The retention of oxygenase activity in the COX-2 mutant enzymes appears to be caused by the fact that the overall available space in the COX-2 active site is greater than in COX-1, and consequently, replacements of certain residues can better be accommodated in COX-2 enzymes (7Luong C. Miller A. Barnett J. Chow J. Ramesha C. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The change of Val-349 to isoleucine (the equivalent residue in the 15R-COX of P. homomalla) altered the reaction specificity of both COX-1 and COX-2, giving enzymes with 41 and 60–65% 15R-oxygenation, respectively. This effect was fairly specific for isoleucine, as Val-349 could be changed to leucine, threonine, asparagine, or alanine with retention of COX activity and without major effects on C-15 oxygenation stereospecificity. In contrast to Ser-530, the different Val-349 mutations yielded highly active enzymes for both COX-1 and COX-2, even when the residue was enlarged to isoleucine, leucine, or asparagine. As assessed from the three-dimensional COX structures, Ser-530 and Val-349 form part of the substrate channel across from Tyr-385 (Fig. 6). In the crystal structure with arachidonic acid bound in the ovine COX-1 active site channel, Ser-530 is positioned to make contact with C-10 and C-16 of arachidonic acid, opposite of Tyr-385. Val-349 is reported to make close contact to C-3 and C-4 of the substrate, and it appears to be well removed from the C-15 position (10Malkowski M.G. Ginell S.L. Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). It is, however, important to note that the oxygenation at C-15 occurs after endoperoxide formation and cyclization to the cyclopentane ring. Both events lead to a pulling back of the ω end of arachidonic acid out of the top channel and move C-15 much closer to Val-349. The crystal structure of PGH2bound in the active site of murine COX-2 showed a distance of only about 4.7 Å between one of the methyl carbons of Val-349 and C-15 of the prostaglandin product (9Kiefer J.R. Pawlitz J.L. Moreland K.T. Stegeman R.A. Hood W.F. Gierse J.K. Stevens A.M. Goodwin D.C. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett L.J. Stallings W.C. Kurumbail R.G. Nature. 2000; 405: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Finally, it is intriguing that Ser-530 and Val-349 are positioned close to each other in the active site, and how individually they exert a similar influence on the same oxygenation event awaits a satisfactory mechanistic explanation. Replacement of Ser-530 in COX-2 with the smaller, nonpolar alanine resulted in the formation of prostaglandins that retained the 15S-configuration. In contrast, replacement of Ser-530 with the larger threonine, methionine, or valine led to almost complete stereochemical inversion of the C-15 oxygenation reaction. The inversion was caused by the polar residue threonine as well as by the nonpolar residues of methionine and valine. Together, these results implicate steric influences on the oxygenation reaction as the main effects, and they rule out the possibility that the hydroxyl of Ser-530 acts as a hydrogen bond donor in maintaining S-oxygenation. Similar considerations hold true for position 349, where the hydrophobic valine replaced by a slightly larger isoleucine caused partial inversion of the stereospecificity of the C-15 oxygenation. In line with this concept, the change of Val-349 to a polar threonine did not interfere with the C-15 oxygenation reaction. There is some resemblance, as well as major differences, in the effects of acetylation of Ser-530 of COX enzymes by aspirin and the effects of mutations to this residue. Both the acetylation and the mutations to methionine, threonine, or valine inactivate the oxygenase activity of human COX-1. With human or murine COX-2, acetylation of Ser-530 blocks prostaglandin synthesis and switches the reaction specificity almost completely to formation of 15R-HETE. The mutations of Ser-530 to threonine, methionine, and valine, on the other hand, do not seriously interfere with the initial steps of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthesis. Only the stereochemistry of the final oxygenation at C-15 is inverted. In line with the effects of acetylation, the mutations also enhance the formation of 15R-HETE as a reaction by-product. It was shown recently that the initial step in 15R-HETE synthesis in acetylated COX-2 involves abstraction of the same pro-S hydrogen at C-13 of arachidonic acid as occurs during normal prostaglandin biosynthesis (16Schneider C. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4743-4746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As an explanation for the change in oxygenation stereospecificity induced by aspirin treatment, it was proposed that acetylated Ser-530 forced a realignment of the ω chain of arachidonic acid, and this unusual binding conformation appeared to be responsible for oxygenation in theR-configuration (16Schneider C. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4743-4746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Xiao G. Tsai A.L. Palmer G. Boyar W.C. Marshall P.J. Kulmacz R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1836-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It is likely that elements of this model also bear in the synthesis of 15R-prostaglandins. The major difference is, as noted above, that the mutations do not seriously interfere with any of the earlier steps in the conversion of arachidonic acid to the prostaglandin endoperoxide. Ser-530 is conserved throughout all reported COX sequences and is mainly known as the residue that is covalently acetylated by aspirin. Based on our findings, an important reason for the strict conservation of Ser-530 relates to its critical role as a determinant of the correct C-15 stereochemistry of the prostaglandin product. Interestingly, Ser-530 is present also in the 15R-COX from P. homomalla. The P. homomalla enzyme appears to rely on other mutations, most likely including the isoleucine substitution at position 349, to synthesize >95% 15R-configuration prostaglandins.

Meyers R. Xie D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3597-3604Google Scholar). It elevates matrix metalloproteinase, production (2Bewsey K.E. Wen C. Purple C. Homandberg G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1317: 55-64Google Scholar), enhances rates of proteoglycan loss, and suppresses proteoglycan synthesis in cartilage explant culture (1Homandberg G.A. Meyers R. Xie D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3597-3604Google Scholar). FN-f also increases the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and IL-1α in cultured human articular cartilage (3Homandberg G.A. Hui F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 325-331Google Scholar). The pathophysiological significance of these FN-f activities is supported by in vivo studies where injection of FN-f into rabbit knee joints caused depletion of cartilage proteoglycan (4Homandberg G.A. Meyers R. Williams J.M. J. Rheumatol. 1993; 20: 1378-1382Google Scholar). Fibronectin is found in high concentrations in both synovial fluid and plasma of osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis patients (5Xie D.L. Meyers R. Homandberg G.A. J. Rheumatol. 1992; 19: 1448-1452Google Scholar, 6Scott D.L. Wainwright A.C. Walton K.W. Williamson N. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1981; 40: 142-153Google Scholar). An increase in fibronectin concentrations in synovial fluid has also been observed in a canine model of OA (7Wurster N.B. Lust G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 800: 52-58Google Scholar). FN-f is produced by proteinase cleavage of native fibronectin (8Homandberg G.A. Wen C. Hui F. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1998; 6: 231-244Google Scholar) and has been reported to be increased in OA synovial fluid and plasma (5Xie D.L. Meyers R. Homandberg G.A. J. Rheumatol. 1992; 19: 1448-1452Google Scholar). Collectively, these results support the notion that FN-f is an inducer of cartilage destruction in OA and rheumatoid arthritis. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) has been implicated in proinflammatory cytokine signaling in chondrocytes (9Shalom-Barak T. Quach J. Lotz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27467-27473Google Scholar). These cytokines activate all three MAP kinase subgroups, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK in human articular chondrocytes (10Geng Y. Valbracht J. Lotz M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2425-2430Google Scholar). However, the cellular receptors and signaling mechanisms that mediated the effects of FN-f have not been fully understood. Cellular adhesion to fibronectin is mediated primarily by the α5β1 integrin that interacts with Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence within fibronectin's tenth type III module (11Wu C. Bauer J.S. Juliano R.L. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21883-21888Google Scholar, 12Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Google Scholar). However, this motif is not present in the 29-kDa FN-f, which has the first five type I repeats, termed matrix assembly sites, that are required for fibronectin binding to cell surface receptors (13Quade B.J. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19602-19609Google Scholar,14Sottile J. Schwarzbauer J. Selegue J. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12840-12843Google Scholar). It has previously been reported that the 29- or 70-kDa amino-terminal fibronectin fragment can bind to the cell surface with the same affinity as intact fibronectin (15McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Google Scholar, 16Limper A.H. Quade B.J. LaChance R.M. Birkenmeier T.M. Rangwala T.S. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9697-9702Google Scholar). It thus remains unclear whether FN-f binds to the fibronectin receptor and can activate integrin-related signals. The present study analyzes intracellular signaling pathways that are activated in human articular chondrocytes by FN-f. We address the following questions: 1) if integrin-related signaling is activated; 2) if MAP kinase subgroups are activated; and 3) which signaling pathways are responsible for FN-f-induced nitric oxide (NO) production.

All other reagents were chemical grade and purchased from Sigma. Human cartilage was obtained at autopsy from donors without known history of joint disease. For all experiments reported here, cartilage from the femoral condyles and tibial plateaus of the knee joints was used. Chondrocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion of cartilage and cultured at high density in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C (17Blanco F.J. Ochs R.L. Schwarz H. Lotz M. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 75-85Google Scholar). Cells were used for experiments in first passage culture and seeded at 30,000 cells/well in 96-well plates for analysis of NO production or at 1,000,000 cells per a 100-mm Petri dish for Western blotting. After cells became confluent, they were cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h prior to stimulation with FN-f. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 30 min at 4 °C and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred into fresh tubes and the protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay. Equal amounts of protein were used for immunoprecipitation. Following preclearing with rabbit IgG-agarose beads, whole cell lysates were incubated with 2 μg of anti-pp125FAK antibody for 1 h at 4 °C and then with protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were sedimented by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 2 min and washed 3 times with ice-cold lysis buffer. Sodium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer containing β2-mercaptoethanol was added and the beads were then boiled for 4 min to dissociate the proteins. Immunoprecipitated proteins or whole cell lysates were separated by 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE, respectively. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). The membranes were first blocked in 5% powdered milk/Tris-buffered saline with Tween (TBS-T) (12.5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h. The membranes were then rinsed once with TBS-T and incubated in 2.5% bovine serum albumin, 2.5% powdered milk/TBS-T, or 5% bovine serum albumin with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody or anti-phospho-MAP kinase antibodies overnight, respectively. The membranes were washed 3 times with TBS-T and then further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in 5% powdered milk/TBS-T for 1 h. Afterward the membranes were washed 3 times with TBS-T and developed according to the supplier's protocol using Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and exposed to x-ray film. Total RNA was isolated from 2 × 106 chondrocytes using the STAT-60 reagent (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) and reverse transcribed using the Superscript Preamplification System (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) with random hexamers. One μl of the reverse transcription reactions was subjected to PCR analysis with primers specific for IL-1β (387-bp product): sense, GAGCTCGCCAGTGAAATGATGGC; antisense, CAAGCTTTTTTGCTGTGAGTCCCG (36 cycles); inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS: 236-bp product): sense, ACATTGATCAGAAGCTGTCCCAC; antisense, CAAAGGCTGTGAGTCCTGCAC (32 cycles); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (190-bp product): sense, TGGTATCGTGGAAGGACTCATG; antisense, ATGCCAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTC (25 cycles). PCR was carried out as follows: 94 °C for 30 s denaturation, 60 °C for 30 s annealing, 72 °C for 30 s extension. The PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. The concentration of nitrites, the stable end products of NO breakdown, in conditioned media from chondrocytes was determined by the Griess reaction using NaNO2 as standard. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. as indicated from at least three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test. NO has been suggested to mediate some of the effects of IL-1 in cartilage degradation (18Lotz M. Rheum. Dis. Clin. North Am. 1999; 25: 269-282Google Scholar). As FN-f induces IL-1-like changes in cartilage, we determined whether FN-f can induce NO production. As shown in Fig.1, iNOS mRNA expression was induced by FN-f stimulation in human articular chondrocytes. FN-f also increased NO production in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1). The induction of NO by FN-f was observed in 16 of 29 normal human chondrocyte preparations and was statistically significant (p < 0.01). The levels of NO induced by optimal concentrations of FN-f were approximately half of that induced by IL-1β. FN-f-induced NO production was completely inhibited by pretreatment with cycloheximide (50 μg/ml). Thus, FN-f stimulated NO production by inducing iNOS mRNA expression and de novosynthesis of iNOS protein. It has been reported that chondrocytes can produce IL-1β and chondrocyte responses to IL-1β and FN-f are qualitatively similar (2Bewsey K.E. Wen C. Purple C. Homandberg G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1317: 55-64Google Scholar, 3Homandberg G.A. Hui F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 325-331Google Scholar). The following experiments determined whether the FN-f effects are dependent on the endogenous production of IL-1β by chondrocytes. IL-1β mRNA up-regulation was observed in response to FN-f or IL-1β stimulation, although the response from some cell preparations was weak (Fig.2). To address the possibility that FN-f-induced NO production is mediated by IL-1β, the effect of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) was determined. IL-1ra partially (by ∼30%) reduced FN-f-induced NO production while the same concentrations of IL-1ra inhibited the high levels of NO production by IL-1β stimulation by 80% (Table I). These findings indicate that FN-f can induce IL-1β but this cytokine has only a minor role in the FN-f activation of chondrocytes as measured by NO release. We also analyzed the chondrocyte response to combinations of IL-1β and FN-f to determine whether these stimuli can synergize. The results showed additive effects but did not reveal any indication of synergy (Fig. 3).Table IEffects of IL-1ra on IL-1 or FN-f-induced NO productionNitrite%nμmControl2.25 ± 0.325IL-1β32.67 ± 6.251005+IL1ra7.52 ± 4.49233Control2.43 ± 0.344FN-f6.64 ± 1.031003+IL1ra4.62 ± 1.02703Chondrocytes were pretreated with 1 μg/ml IL-1ra for 2 h and then stimulated with 2 ng/ml IL-1β or 0.5 μm FN-f.

Nitrite levels in culture supernatants were analyzed 48 h poststimulation by Griess method. Results represent mean values ± S.E. from three to five different experiments (n = number of experiments). The α5β1 integrin is the major fibronectin receptor in chondrocytes (19Salter D.M. Hughes D.E. Simpson R. Gardner D.L. Br. J. Rheumatol. 1992; 31: 231-234Google Scholar, 20Woods V.L.J. Schreck P.J. Gesink D.S. Pacheco H.O. Amiel D. Akeson W.H. Lotz M. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 537-544Google Scholar). Therefore, we first determined if FN-f activates FAK since FAK is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to integrin engagement (21Kornberg L.J. Earp H.S. Turner C.E. Prockop C. Juliano R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8392-8396Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK was detected 2.5–5 min after FN-f stimulation. This phosphorylation was transient and after 15 min of incubation with FN-f, FAK phosphorylation was reduced to basal levels (Fig. 4). We next determined if integrin blocking antibodies or synthetic peptides containing the Arg-Gly-Asp cell binding region of fibronectin, affect FN-f induced NO production. However, neither α5(JBS5) nor β1 (mAb13) integrin blocking antibodies nor the RGD-containing synthetic peptide, RGDS, inhibited FN-f induced NO production (Fig. 5). This suggests that the α5β1 integrin does not mediate the effects of FN-f. Consistent with this is the observation that native fibronectin did not antagonize NO production induced by FN-f stimulation (Fig. 5). Furthermore, native fibronectin did not induce NO production by itself (data not shown). Thus, FN-f induces FAK phosphorylation, but the α5β1 fibronectin receptor does not mediate this effect. We next determined if FAK activation is involved in FN-f-induced NO production in human chondrocytes. It has been reported that Src family tyrosine kinases or cytoskeletal organization were necessary for FAK phosphorylation (22Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3489-3505Google Scholar). PP2 a selective Src family tyrosine-protein kinase inhibitor dose-dependently inhibited NO production and it completely inhibited NO production at 10 μm. Cytochalasin D, which disrupts actin polymerization, also partially (by ∼50%) inhibited NO production (Fig. 5). The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) is one of the FAK-related signaling pathways (23Chen H.C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26329-26334Google Scholar). However, the PI-3K inhibitor wortmannin did not inhibit NO production by FN-f. Taken together, these results suggest that FAK activation is necessary for FN-f-induced NO production in human chondrocytes, but this does not involve PI-3K. MAP kinase pathways are important in cell signaling in response to cytokine stimulation and integrin activation (24Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Google Scholar, 25Dolfi F. Garcia-Guzman M. Ojaniemi M. Nakamura H. Matsuda M. Vuori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15394-15399Google Scholar). We thus determined if FN-f activates MAPK pathways by detecting the phosphorylated forms of ERK, JNK, and p38, using phospho-specific antibodies (Fig.6). Increased phosphorylation of ERK and JNK was observed from 5 to 60 min after FN-f stimulation. Phosphorylation of p38 was also observed at 5 min after FN-f stimulation but it was reduced to basal levels at 30 min. Little or no activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK was detected in unstimulated chondrocytes. Thus, FN-f is capable of activating all three MAPK pathways in human articular chondrocytes. To further investigate whether ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK are involved in FN-f-induced NO production in human chondrocytes, we used selective protein kinase inhibitors: PD98059 a specific MEK1/2 inhibitor that blocks the ERK signaling cascade, and SB203580 which selectively inhibits p38 MAPK at low concentration, but which inhibits both p38 MAPK and JNK at high concentrations (26Whitmarsh A.J. Yang S.H. Su M.S. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2360-2371Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.7, FN-f-induced NO production was inhibited by 50% at 10 μm PD98059 and by 80% at 10 μm SB203580. These findings suggest that the MAPK, particularly ERK and JNK, mediate FN-f induced chondrocyte activation. FN-f has potent chondrolytic activity and is present at increased levels in synovial fluid of OA and rheumatoid arthritis patients (1Homandberg G.A. Meyers R. Xie D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3597-3604Google Scholar, 5Xie D.L. Meyers R. Homandberg G.A. J. Rheumatol. 1992; 19: 1448-1452Google Scholar,6Scott D.L. Wainwright A.C. Walton K.W. Williamson N. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1981; 40: 142-153Google Scholar). FN-f may thus play an important role in cartilage destruction in arthritis. In this study, we examined signaling events that are activated by FN-f. We showed that FN-f increased iNOS mRNA expression and NO production in human articular chondrocytes. We confirmed that FN-f-induced IL-1β mRNA expression in human articular chondrocytes as was previously reported (2Bewsey K.E. Wen C. Purple C. Homandberg G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1317: 55-64Google Scholar, 3Homandberg G.A. Hui F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 325-331Google Scholar, 27Homandberg G.A. Hui F. Wen C. Purple C. Bewsey K. Koepp H. Huch K. Harris A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 751-757Google Scholar). This suggested the possibility that FN-f-induced iNOS mRNA expression and NO production are mediated by IL-1β induction. Therefore, the effect of IL-1ra on FN-f-induced NO production was examined. Although IL-1ra almost completely inhibited IL-1β-induced NO production, it showed only partial inhibition against FN-f-induced NO production. These results indicate most of the effect of FN-f is not mediated by IL-1β. We then applied the FN-f-induced NO production to study receptors and intracellular signaling events that are required for FN-f activation of chondrocytes. A binding study using radiolabeled FN-f demonstrated a relatively high number of binding sites on chondrocytes (28Xie D. Homandberg G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1182: 189-196Google Scholar). Some reports suggest that FN-f binds to chondrocytes through the fibronectin α5β1 integrin receptor since synthetic peptides which contain Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) integrin-binding sequence block activities of FN-f and anti-β1 integrin antibody blocked binding of the 70-kDa amino-terminal fibronectin fragment, which does not contain an integrin-binding domain, to fibroblasts (29Fogerty F.J. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 699-708Google Scholar). However, it was also reported that RGDS peptide did not block proteoglycan loss induced by FN-f in bovine cartilage explant culture (30Homandberg G.A. Hui F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 40-48Google Scholar). Our results show that neither the integrin-binding peptides, RGDS, nor α5β1 integrin blocking antibodies could inhibit FN-f-induced NO production. Most interestingly, even native fibronectin, which binds the α5β1integrin, did not induce NO production. These results suggest that FN-f does not activate α5β1 integrin, but that other integrins or non-integrin receptors are involved. Several putative receptors for FN-f have been proposed. FN-f has been shown to bind a 67-kDa membrane protein isolated from rat macrophages (31Blystone S.D. Kaplan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3968-3975Google Scholar) and a 66-kDa membrane protein from chick myoblasts (32Moon K.Y. Shin K.S. Song W.K. Chung C.H. Ha D.B. Kang M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7651-7657Google Scholar). The molecular mass of these receptor candidates would suggest that they do not represent integrins. Our results on intracellular signaling events showed that FN-f transiently induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. We then analyzed signaling pathways that are involved with FN-f-induced NO production and determined the effect of PP2, which selectively inhibits Src family tyrosine-protein kinases (33Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Google Scholar), or cytochalasin D, an agent which disrupts actin polymerization (34Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1473-1478Google Scholar). FAK may function to direct phosphorylation of cellular substrates by recruitment of Src kinases (21Kornberg L.J. Earp H.S. Turner C.E. Prockop C. Juliano R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8392-8396Google Scholar, 35Lavoie J.N. Champagne C. Gingras M.C. Robert A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1037-1056Google Scholar). Cytochalasin D has been shown to prevent adhesion-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation (36Haimovich B. Lipfert L. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15868-15877Google Scholar, 37Bockholt S.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14565-14567Google Scholar). PP2 and cytochalasin D inhibited FN-f-induced NO production in human chondrocytes. We next determined if the PI-3K pathway, which is a major substrate of FAK (22Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3489-3505Google Scholar), is involved in FN-f-induced NO production. However, the PI-3K inhibitor wortmannin did not inhibit NO production. These data suggest that activation of FAK is required for FN-f-induced NO production but this does not involve PI-3K. We next demonstrated that FN-f activated the three MAPK pathways, ERK, JNK, and p38. Inhibition of FN-f-induced NO production was only observed with high concentrations of PD98059 (10 μm) or SB203580 (10 μm). Particularly, SB203580 inhibits only p38 MAPK at low concentration (≤1 μm) but inhibits both p38 MAPK and JNK at high concentrations (10–25 μm) (25Dolfi F. Garcia-Guzman M. Ojaniemi M. Nakamura H. Matsuda M. Vuori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15394-15399Google Scholar). Moreover, the amount of p38 phosphorylation by FN-f was relatively smaller than that of JNK. It has been recently reported that the specific Src family kinase inhibitor, PP2, inhibited JNK activation but had no effect on ERK and p38 MAPK activation (38Yoshizumi M. Abe J. Haendeler J. Huang Q. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11706-11712Google Scholar). Our data also demonstrates that PP2 strongly inhibited FN-f-induced NO production. Therefore, inhibition of NO production by high concentrations of SB203580 appears to be mediated by JNK inhibition. Similarly, only high concentrations of PD98059 could partially inhibit FN-f-induced NO production. Almeida et al. (39Almeida E.A. Ilic D. Han Q. Hauck C.R. Jin F. Kawakatsu H. Schlaepfer D.D. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 741-754Google Scholar) recently reported that FAK can activate both JNK and ERK in synovial fibroblasts. Wang and Brecher (40Wang Z. Brecher P. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 1259-1264Google Scholar) suggested that ERK did not regulate iNOS mRNA expression but possibly influenced post-transcriptional events. Therefore, it is possible that ERK might promote FN-f-induced NO production, through the stabilization of iNOS mRNA. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that FN-f induces NO production by up-regulating iNOS mRNA in human articular chondrocytes. Although FN-f increases IL-1β mRNA levels, IL-1β plays only a minor role in FN-f-induced NO production. FN-f can activate FAK. However, this does not seem to be mediated by the α5β1 integrin, a major fibronectin receptor. Activation of MAP kinases, particularly ERK and JNK, are central signaling events in the chondrocyte response to FN-f. We thank J. Quach for assistance in cell isolation and culture.

https://openalex.org/W2164917763,"MCF-7 human breast cancer cells are widely utilized to study apoptotic processes. Recent studies demonstrated that these cells lack procaspase-3. In the present study, caspase activation and activity were examined in this cell line after treatment with the microtubule poison paclitaxel. When cells were harvested 72 h after the start of a 24-h treatment with 100 nmpaclitaxel, 37 ± 5% of the cells were nonadherent and displayed apoptotic morphological changes. Although mitochondrial cytochromec release and caspase-9 cleavage were detectable by immunoblotting, assays of cytosol and nuclei prepared from the apoptotic cells failed to demonstrate the presence of activity that cleaved the synthetic caspase substrates LEHD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (LEHD-AFC), DEVD-AFC, and VEID-AFC. Likewise, the paclitaxel-treated MCF-7 cells failed to cleave a variety of caspase substrates, including lamin A, β-catenin, gelsolin, protein kinase Cδ, topoisomerase I, and procaspases-6, -8, and -10. Transfection of MCF-7 cells with wild type procaspase-3 partially restored cleavage of these polypeptides but did not result in detectable activities that could cleave the synthetic caspase substrates. Immunoblotting revealed that caspase-9, and -3, which were proteolytically cleaved in paclitaxel-treated MCF-7/caspase-3 cells, were sequestered in a salt-resistant sedimentable fraction rather than released to the cytosol. Immunofluorescence indicated large cytoplasmic aggregates containing cleaved caspase-3 in these apoptotic cells. These observations suggest that sequestration of caspases can occur in some model systems, causing tetrapeptide-based activity assays to underestimate the amount of caspase activation that has occurredin situ. MCF-7 human breast cancer cells are widely utilized to study apoptotic processes. Recent studies demonstrated that these cells lack procaspase-3. In the present study, caspase activation and activity were examined in this cell line after treatment with the microtubule poison paclitaxel. When cells were harvested 72 h after the start of a 24-h treatment with 100 nmpaclitaxel, 37 ± 5% of the cells were nonadherent and displayed apoptotic morphological changes. Although mitochondrial cytochromec release and caspase-9 cleavage were detectable by immunoblotting, assays of cytosol and nuclei prepared from the apoptotic cells failed to demonstrate the presence of activity that cleaved the synthetic caspase substrates LEHD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (LEHD-AFC), DEVD-AFC, and VEID-AFC.

In particular, caspase-mediated cleavages destabilize structural components of the cytoskeleton, inactivate key components of DNA repair pathways, and interrupt signal transduction pathways involved in cell survival (8Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). At the same time, caspases appear to activate a number of enzymes, including the caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease (9Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar), gelsolin (10Kothakota S. Azuma T. Reinhard C. Klippel A. Tang J. Chu K. McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Koths K. Kwiatkowski D.J.

Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6683) Google Scholar) that constitute the process of apoptosis. Because of the importance of caspases in the apoptotic process, many laboratories are currently performing enzymatic assays to assess the activation of these proteases. In a typical assay, cells are lysed, particulate matter is sedimented, and supernatants are incubated with low molecular weight substrates that consist of a tetrapeptide or pentapeptide coupled to a fluorogenic or chromogenic leaving group (12Nicholson D.W.

The MCF-7 human breast cancer line has been widely utilized to study various components of the apoptotic machinery. Early studies demonstrated that apoptotic DNA degradation in this cell line generates high molecular weight DNA cleavage products but not internucleosomal fragments (16Oberhammer F. Wilson J.W.

Many of these studies were performed under the assumption that MCF-7 cells contain a normal complement of procaspases and scaffolding molecules required for their activation. Additional studies, however, have revealed that MCF-7 cells lack procaspase-3 polypeptide (33Li F.L. Srinivasan A. Wang Y. Armstrong R.C. Tomaselli K.J. Fritz L.C. J. Biol.

Despite this lack of caspase-3 protein and activity, cleavage of all caspase substrates except α-fodrin was initially reported to be normal in MCF-7 cells (35Janicke R.U. Ng P. Sprengart M.L.

Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that paclitaxel, a chemotherapeutic agent that is widely used in the clinical treatment of breast cancer (36Rowinsky E.K. Donehower R.C. N.

This process of paclitaxel-induced apoptosis was accompanied by release of cytochrome c from mitochondria; activation of caspases-3, -6 and -7; and cleavage of all caspase substrates examined, including PARP, lamin A, lamin B1, focal adhesion kinase, and topo I (39Kottke T.J.

Preliminary results, however, indicated that cleavage of topo I, the single caspase substrate examined in our earlier study, was undetectable in paclitaxel-treated MCF-7 cells (40Samejima K. Svingen P.A. Basi G.S. Kottke T. Mesner Jr., P.W. Stewart L. Durrieu F. Poirier G.G. Alnemri E.S. Champoux J.J. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. J. Biol.

In view of the widespread use of MCF-7 cells as a model system for the study of apoptosis, we have reexamined the relationship between caspase activation, substrate cleavage, and detection of caspase activity in MCF-7 cells. Using a wide range of immunological probes, we demonstrate in the present study that paclitaxel treatment in this cell line is accompanied by release of cytochrome c to cytosol, proteolytic cleavage of procaspases-9 and -7, and digestion of PARP and ICAD, two polypeptides that can be cleaved by either caspase-3 or caspase-7 (41Germain M.

Talanian R.V. Nagata S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4401-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In contrast, cleavage of additional polypeptides, including topo I, the lamins, β-catenin, gelsolin, protein kinase Cδ, and procaspases-6, -8, and -10, is undetectable after paclitaxel treatment. Transfection of procaspase-3 into MCF-7 cells partially restores the paclitaxel-induced cleavage of this second group of polypeptides. Interestingly, however, cleavage of tetrapeptide substrates such as DEVD-AFC, LEHD-AFC, and VEID-AFC remains extremely low after paclitaxel treatment of procaspase-3-transfected MCF-7 cells. Further studies using an antiserum that recognizes a neoepitope at the carboxyl terminus of the caspase-3 large subunit (43Mesner Jr., P.W. Bible K.C. Martins L.M. Kottke T.J. Srinivasula S.M. Svingen P.A. Chilcote T.J. Basi G.S. Tung J.S. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Alnemri E.S. Earnshaw E.C. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol.

Instead, it accumulates in a detergent- and salt-resistant fraction that sediments at low speed. These observations not only provide additional evidence that caspase-3 is required for the cleavage of a variety of nuclear and cytoplasmic substrates but also indicate that sequestration of cleaved caspases can result in underestimation of enzyme activity when caspase assays are performed using widely accepted methods.

The IC50 values of the compound were 30 μm for pol β and 37 μm for pol λ. Because pol β and λ are in a family and their three-dimensional structures are thought to be highly similar to each other, we used pol β to analyze the biochemical relationship with solanapyrone A. On pol β, solanapyrone A antagonistically competed with both the DNA template and the nucleotide substrate. BIAcore analysis demonstrated that solanapyrone A bound selectively to the N-terminal 8-kDa domain of pol β. This domain is known to bind single-stranded DNA, provide 5′-phosphate recognition of gapped DNA, and cleave the sugar-phosphate bond 3′ to an intact apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site (i.e. AP lyase activity) including 5′-deoxyribose phosphate lyase activity. Solanapyrone A inhibited the single-stranded DNA-binding activity but did not influence the activities of the 5′-phosphate recognition in gapped DNA structures and the AP lyase. Based on these results, the inhibitory mechanism of solanapyrone A is discussed.

The purpose was to use the compounds as tools and molecular probes to distinguish DNA polymerases and to clarify their biological andin vivo functions. In this study, we found an interesting fungus-produced compound that selectively inhibits the activities of pol β and pol λ. Interestingly, the compound was found to be a plant phytotoxin, solanapyrone A, isolated from the causal fungus of early blight disease in potato. To our knowledge, such specific natural compounds have not been reported with the exception of the pol β-inhibitor, prunasin, which we reported previously (13Mizushina Y. Takahashi N. Ogawa A. Tsurugaya K. Koshino H. Takemura M. Yoshida S. Matsukage A. Sugawara F. Sakaguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 126: 430-436Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The compound was a stronger pol β-inhibitor than prunasin, and no pol λ-inhibitors have been reported. Pol β is the lowest molecular mass (39 kDa) DNA polymerase lacking such intrinsic accessory activities as 3′- or 5′-exonuclease, endonuclease, dNMP turnover, or pyrophosphorolysis (16Wilson S.H. Strauss P.R. Wilson S.H. The Eukaryotic Nucleus: Molecular Biochemistry and Micromolecular Assemblies. 1. Telford Press, Caldwell, NJ1990: 199-233Google Scholar). Pol β consists of an independently folded N-terminal 8-kDa domain and C-terminal 31-kDa domain (17Kumar A. Widen S.G. Williams K.R. Kedar P. Karpel R.L. Wilson S.H. J. Biol.

The N-terminal domain was originally characterized as a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding domain. It was then found to possess binding specificity for the 5′-phosphate in gapped DNA (19Casas-Finet J.R. Kumar A. Morris G. Wilson S.H. Karpel R.L. J. Biol.

Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) demonstrated that pol β catalyzes the removal of dRP from the AP endonuclease-incised AP site via β-elimination as opposed to hydrolysis, and that this dRP lyase activity resides in the 8-kDa domain of pol β. According to recent studies (7Garcia-Diaz M. Dominguez O. Lopez-Fernandez L.A. de Lera L.T. Saniger M.L. Ruiz J.F. Parraga M. Garcia-Ortiz M.J. Kirchhoff T. del Mazo J. Bernad A. Blanco L. J. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3684-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), moreover, pol β is known to have another family polymerase, pol λ. Pol β has been present in all tissues examined and is generally expressed at a low level as are a number of other so-called constitutive “house-keeping” enzymes. Although the in vivo function of the family enzyme, pol λ, is unclear as yet, pol λ appears to work in a similar manner to pol β (7Garcia-Diaz M. Dominguez O. Lopez-Fernandez L.A. de Lera L.T. Saniger M.L. Ruiz J.F. Parraga M. Garcia-Ortiz M.J. Kirchhoff T. del Mazo J. Bernad A. Blanco L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 851-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). As to why a plant phytotoxin is a pol β-family-specific inhibitor, we presently are analyzing the structure and function of pol β and pol λ using the inhibitor from two different view-points to understand the precise role of each of the polymerases in vivo and to develop a drug design strategy for cancer chemotherapy agents. We previously reported the three-dimensional structure of pol β and the N-terminal 8-kDa domain (the DNA template-binding domain) with or without long chain fatty acids to further clarify the structure and function of pol β (26Mizushina Y. Ohkubo T. Date T. Yamaguchi T. Saneyoshi M. Sugawara F. Sakaguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25599-25607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because at least pol β is an essential enzyme for nucleotide excision repair (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA replication.2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1992: 197-225Google Scholar, 2Wilson S.H. Mutat. Res. 1998; 407: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), the plant phytotoxin may lead to blockage of the DNA repair systems of rescue cancer cells under clinical radiation-therapy or chemotherapy. The plant phytotoxin is not only a useful molecular tool for analyzing the polymerases, it might also be considered as a potentially useful cancer chemotherapy agent. Solanapyrone A, found as a novel inhibitor of pol β and pol λ in this report, is a plant phytotoxin isolated together with other toxic metabolites from Alternaria solani, the causal fungus of early potato blight (27Katayama K. Kobayashi T. Oikawa H. Honma M. Ichihara A. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1998; 1384: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 28Ichihara A. Miki M. Sakamura S. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 2453-2454Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The biochemical mode of action is still unknown, although there is a report on the detection of the enzymatic activity, isolation, and characterization of an enzyme catalyzing a Diels-Alder reaction (29Ichihara A. Tazaki H. Sakamura S. Tetrahedron Lett. 1983; 24: 5373-5376Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This compound was found to bind directly to the 8-kDa domain of pol β, but not to the 31-kDa domain, and in the three functional activities of the 8-kDa domain (i.e. ssDNA binding, 5′-phosphate recognition in gapped DNA, and dRP lyase activity using intact AP site containing DNA substrate) to inhibit only the ssDNA-binding activity. Based on these results, the inhibitory action of solanapyrone A and its relation to the enzyme structure of the 8-kDa domain of pol β is discussed under “Discussion.” Nucleotides and chemically synthesized template-primers, such as poly(dA), poly(rA), oligo(dT)12–18, [3H]dTTP (43 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and [α-32P]ddATP (3000 Ci/mmol), were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. M13 plasmid DNA was purchased from Takara (Tokyo, Japan). The double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide containing an AP site at position 10 was purchased from Trevigen (Gaithersburg, MD). All other reagents were of analytical grade and were purchased from Wako Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). DNA polymerase α was purified from calf thymus by immunoaffinity column chromatography (30Tamai K.

Recombinant rat DNA polymerase β was purified from Escherichia coliJMpβ5 as described by Date et al. (31Date T. Yamaguchi M. Hirose F. Nishimoto Y. Tanihara K. Matsukage A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2983-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 8-kDa domain of rat pol β (residues 2–87) was overexpressed inE. coli strain BL21 harboring the expression plasmid “Lys-87” constructed in our laboratory. The overproduction of the 8-kDa domain and the purification procedure were principally the same as for the intact pol β (31Date T. Yamaguchi M. Hirose F. Nishimoto Y. Tanihara K. Matsukage A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2983-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Pol δ was purified from calf thymus (32Shoji-Kawaguchi M. Izuta S. Tamiya-Koizumi K. Suzuki M. Yoshida S. J. Biochem.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Full-length human cDNA encoding pol λ (64 kDa) was generated by PCR using primers l-F1 (5′-GCAGAATTCATGGATCCCAGGGGTATCTTGAAG-3′) and L-R1 (5′-GTTCTCGAGCCAGTCCC- GCTCAGCAGGTTCTCG-3′). l-F1 and l-R1 primers contain EcoRI and XhoI sites (underlined), respectively. PCR was performed by the standard procedure of expand high fidelity (PharMingen). The template used was human placenta cDNA library (CLONTECH). The DNA sequences of the PCR products were determined by the dideoxy termination method. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XhoI restriction enzymes, and the DNA fragments obtained were subcloned into the bacteriophage T7 promoter-based expression vector pET28a(+) (Novargen) between the EcoRI and XhoI sites. Recombinant His-pol λ was overexpressed and purified according to the recommended procedures by Novargen. Pol I (α-like) and II (β-like) from a higher plant, cauliflower influorescence, were purified according to the methods outlined by Sakaguchi et al. (34Sakaguchi K. Hotta Y. Stern H. Cell Struct.

The Klenow fragment of pol I and human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase were purchased from Worthington Biochemical Corp. (Freehold, NJ). Calf thymus terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, T7 RNA polymerase, and bovine pancreas deoxyribonuclease I were purchased from Stratagene Cloning Systems (La Jolla, CA). Taq DNA polymerase, T4 DNA polymerase, and T4 polynucleotide kinase were purchased from Takara (Tokyo, Japan). The reaction mixtures for pol α, pol β, plant, and prokaryotic DNA polymerases were described previously (9Mizushina Y. Tanaka N. Yagi H. Kurosawa T. Onoue M. Seto H. Horie T. Aoyagi N. Yamaoka M.

The substrates of the DNA polymerases used were poly(dA)/oligo(dT)12–18 and dTTP as template-primer DNA and nucleotide substrate, respectively. The substrates of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase used were poly(rA)/oligo(dT)12–18 and dTTP as template-primer and nucleotide substrate, respectively. The substrates of terminal deoxynucleotidyltranscriptase used were oligo(dT)12–18(3′-OH) and dTTP as template-primer and nucleotide substrate, respectively. Solanapyrone A was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at various concentrations and sonicated for 30 s. 4 μl of the sonicated samples was mixed with 16 μl of each enzyme (final 0.05 units) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol, and 0.1 mm EDTA, and kept at 0 °C for 10 min. These inhibitor-enzyme mixtures (8 μl) were added to 16 μl of each of the standard enzyme reaction mixtures, and incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 60 min with the exception of Taq DNA polymerase, which was incubated at 74 °C for 60 min. The activity without the inhibitor was considered to be 100%, and the remaining activities at each concentration of inhibitor were determined as percentages of this value. One unit of each DNA polymerase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the incorporation of 1 nmol dTTP into the synthetic template-primers (i.e.poly(dA)/oligo(dT)12–18 = 2/1) in 60 min at 37 °C under the normal reaction conditions for each enzyme (9Mizushina Y.

Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29570-29577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Unreacted N-hydroxysuccinimide ester groups were inactivated using 1 m ethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.0. This reaction immobilized approximately 5000 response units of the protein. The binding analysis of solanapyrone A was performed in running buffer including solanapyrone A (5 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 10% Me2SO) at a flow rate of 20 μl/min at 25 °C. Kinetic parameters were determined using the software BIA evaluation 3.1. The gel mobility shift assay was carried out as described by Casas-Finet et al. (19Casas-Finet J.R. Kumar A. Morris G. Wilson S.H. Karpel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19618-19625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding mixture (a final volume of 20 μl) contained 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mm KCl, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% Me2SO, 2 mm EDTA, M13 plasmid DNA (2.2 nmol, nucleotide, single-stranded and singly primed), and 0.15 nmol 80-kDa domain of pol β. Various concentrations of solanapyrone A were added to the binding mixture followed by incubation at 25 °C for 10 min. Samples were run on a 1.0% agarose gel in 0.1m Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3, containing 5 mmEDTA at 50 V for 2 h. The 5′-end of the dephosphorylated primer (Fig. 6A, primer 1, 17-mer) was labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Loboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 11.31Google Scholar). The 3′-end of the 29 base oligodeoxyribonucleotide containing an AP site at position 10 (Fig. 7, A andB) was labeled on its 3′-end with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase using [α-32P]ddATP. These oligonucleotides were annealed to their complementary strands by heating the solution at 90 °C for 3 min followed by slow cooling to 25 °C. 32P-Labeled duplex oligodeoxynucleotide was separated from unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP or [α-32P]ddATP using a MicroSpin G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) according to the protocol suggested by the manufacturer.Figure 7Cleavage of AP site containing double-stranded DNA by the N-terminal 8-kDa domain of polβ.A and B, DNA sequence illustrating the cleavage positions of the 8-kDa domain of pol β in the 20-base pair substrate containing an abasic site at position 10. Because the 3′-end of the AP site-containing strand was labeled with [α-32P]ddAMP, the cleaved DNA product will be one nucleotide longer (11-mer).

Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18096-18101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and various concentrations of solanapyrone A in a reaction mixture containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10% Me2SO and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The samples were spotted onto Parafilm and irradiated at 254 nm for 4 min using a UV-stratalinker (Stratagene Cloning Systems). The photochemical cross-linked 8-kDa protein-DNA complexes were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. AP lyase activity was determined in a reaction mixture (20 μl) that contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% Me2SO, 200 nm 8-kDa domain of pol β, and various concentrations of solanapyrone A. The mixture was preincubated, and then32P-labeled double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide containing an AP site at position 10 was added. After incubation for 15 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated, and the product was stabilized by the addition of 2 m NaBH4 to a final concentration of 340 mm and then incubated for 30 min at 0 °C. The stabilized DNA product was recovered by ethanol precipitation in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml tRNA and resuspended in 10 μl of gel loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 0.02% xylene cyanol). After incubation at 75 °C for 2 min, the reaction products were separated by electrophoresis in a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 murea in 89 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA and visualized by autoradiography. The molecular docking of solanapyrone A and the 8-kDa domain of pol β was done using a fixed docking procedure in the Affinity program within the Insight II modeling software (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, 1999). Solanapyrone A was placed to orient the aldehyde moiety to Lys65 of pol β. The calculations used a CVFF force-field in the Discovery program and a Monte Carlo strategy in the Affinity programs (44Kurinov I.V. Myers D.E. Irvin J.D. Uckun F.M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1765-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Each energy-minimized final docking position of solanapyrone A was evaluated using the interactive score function in the Ludi module. Ludi score includes contribution of the loss of translational and rotational entropy of the fragment, number and quality of hydrogen bonds, and contributions from ionic and lipophilic interactions to the binding energy. We screened for DNA polymerase inhibitors and found a natural compound that selectively inhibited mammalian DNA polymerase β activity from a fungus (SUT 01B1-2) collected from fields in the vicinity of Noda city in Chiba prefecture, Japan. The compound was extracted with CH2Cl2 from the broth of the fungus, and then purified by silica gel column and Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography. Negative FABHR (Fast Atom Bombardment High Resolution) mass and [1H]NMR, [13C]NMR, and DEPT (Distortionless Enhancement by Polarization Transfer) NMR spectroscopic analyses indicated that the inhibitor was found to be an agent known as solanapyrone A previously reported as a phytotoxin isolated together with other toxic metabolites from A. solani, the causal fungus of early potato blight (28Ichihara A. Miki M. Sakamura S. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 2453-2454Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The chemical structure of solanapyrone A is shown in Fig. 1. The fact that a plant phytotoxin is an inhibitor of DNA polymerase is of interest. Fig.2 shows the inhibition dose-response curves of solanapyrone A against mammalian DNA polymerases. Solanapyrone A was effective at inhibiting rat DNA polymerase β and human DNA polymerase λ (pol λ or pol β2), but not replicative DNA polymerases such as calf DNA polymerase δ and human DNA polymerase ε, and only slightly in calf DNA polymerase α (Fig. 2). The inhibition of pol β by solanapyrone A was dose-dependent with a 50% inhibition observed at a dose of 30 μm and almost a complete inhibition at 80 μm (Fig. 2). Because dideoxy thymidine triphosphate (ddTTP), a potent inhibitor of mammalian pol β, shows complete inhibition at 40 μm (45Izuta S. Saneyoshi M. Sakurai T. Suzuki M. Kojima K. Yoshida S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the effect of solanapyrone A on this enzyme was almost as strong as that of ddTTP. The IC50 values of solanapyrone A on calf pol α, calf pol δ, and human pol ε were over 100 μm (Fig.2). The inhibitory effect of solanapyrone A on higher plant cauliflower pol II (β-like) was stronger than that of pol I (α-like), and the IC50 values were 41 and >100 μm, respectively (Table I). Solanapyrone A had no inhibitory effect on prokaryotic DNA polymerases, such as the Klenow fragment of E. coli pol I, TaqDNA polymerase, T4 DNA polymerase, and other DNA-metabolic enzymes such as calf terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, human telomerase, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, T7 RNA polymerase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and bovine deoxyribonuclease I (Table I). The IC50 values in Table I did not change when the template-primer was activated DNA.Table IIC50 values of solanapyrone A on the activities of various DNA polymerases and other DNA metabolic enzymesEnzymeIC50 value of solanapyroneμmMammalian DNA polymerases— Calf DNA polymerase α>100 Rat DNA polymerase β30 Calf DNA polymerase δ>100 Human DNA polymerase ɛ>100 Human DNA polymerase λ37Plant DNA polymerases— Cauliflower DNA polymerase I (α-like)>100 Cauliflower DNA polymerase II (β-like)41Prokaryotic DNA polymerases— E. coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment)>100 Taq DNA polymerase>100 T4 DNA polymerase>100Other DNA metabolic enzymes— Calf DNA primase of DNA polymerase α>100 Calf terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase>100 Human telomerase>100 HIV-1 reverse transcriptase>100 T7 RNA polymerase>100 T4 polynucleotide kinase>100 Bovine deoxyribonuclease I>100Solanapyrone A was incubated with each enzyme (0.05 units).

Interestingly, in the inhibition spectrum, solanapyrone A inhibited the activity of pol λ, which has been recently identified as a new family member of pol β. The inhibitory effect of pol λ was the same as that of pol β, and the IC50 value was 37 μm.

https://openalex.org/W2082451299,"The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is a hormone-dependent regulator of gene transcription that in the absence of ligand resides both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Agonists but not antagonists increase the number of MRs residing in the nucleus and cause aggregation of MRs into distinct clusters. To identify the functional determinants of MR nuclear organization, we examined the localization pattern of wild type MR and a series of mutants in the presence and absence of ligands using fluorescent protein chimeras in living cells. Our data show that although MR DNA binding is not necessary to mediate nuclear localization, it is absolutely required for wild type cluster formation as is an intact N-terminal or C-terminal activation function. In contrast, destabilization of a dimerization motif within the DNA-binding domain has no effect on subnuclear receptor architecture. These data suggest that normal MR cluster formation is dependent on both DNA binding and intact transcriptional activation functions but not on DNA-dependent receptor dimerization. Because dimer mutants bind with high affinity to hormone response element DNA multimers but not to single palindromic DNA sites, we suggest that clusters represent MR aggregates bound to DNA response element multimers in the vicinity of regulated genes.

Following the binding of a cognate agonist, these receptors undergo a change in conformation, enter the nucleus, and/or alter their subnuclear localization (1Fejes-Toth G. Pearce D. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2973-2978Google Scholar, 2Htun H. Barsony J. Renyi I. Gould D.L. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4845-4850Google Scholar), steps that are essential for the subsequent regulation of gene expression (3DeFranco D.B. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 1-24Google Scholar). The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR),1 a member of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) subfamily of steroid receptors that also includes the progesterone and androgen receptors (4Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. et al.Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Google Scholar), provides a particularly striking example of context-dependent regulation. It can either activate or repress gene transcription in a highly context-dependent fashion (5Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Google Scholar, 6Meijer O.C. Williamson A. Dallman M.F. Pearce D. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2000; 12: 245-254Google Scholar), and moreover, the receptor and its close relative, the GR, have indistinguishable activities in some contexts, whereas in others their activities are strikingly distinct (5Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Google Scholar, 7Liu W. Wang J. Yu G. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406Google Scholar, 8Rupprecht R. Arriza J.L. Spengler D. Reul J.M. Evans R.M. Holsboer F. Damm K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 597-603Google Scholar). The “context” of receptor function is determined by both non-DNA factors that modify receptor activity (e.g. coactivators, corepressors, and other transcription factors) and the DNA itself. Several different types of cis-acting DNA sequences, termed hormone response elements (HREs), have been identified, each of which has distinct structural features and patterns of receptor response. 1) “simple” HREs are composed of two palindromic half-sites separated by three nucleotides (9Chandler V.L. Maler B.A. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1983; 33: 489-499Google Scholar, 10Strahle U. Klock G. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7871-7875Google Scholar). An intact DBD dimer interface is essential for binding and activation at simple HREs, and the receptors bind as homodimers or heterodimers to stimulate transcription of linked genes (11Trapp T. Rupprecht R. Castren M. Reul J.M. Holsboer F. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1457-1462Google Scholar, 12Liu W. Wang J. Sauter N.K. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12480-12484Google Scholar). 2) Compound HREs are composed of multiple simple HREs of variable spacing. Their behavior is similar to simple HREs in many respects (e.g. protein-DNA interaction is required for function, and they invariably mediate stimulation and never repression of gene transcription), however, the mode of receptor binding and activation of transcription are quite distinct from simple HREs. Synergy is an important determinant of receptor activity at compound HREs, and the DBD dimer interface is dispensable for the binding and activation of transcription (7Liu W. Wang J. Yu G. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406Google Scholar, 13Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Pearce D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6040-6050Google Scholar). 3) Tethering sites mediate repression of transcription through protein-protein interaction. The receptors do not bind directly to these sites but rather are “tethered” through interaction with other DNA-bound transcription factors (6Meijer O.C. Williamson A. Dallman M.F. Pearce D. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2000; 12: 245-254Google Scholar, 14Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K.K. Cato A.C. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 1189-1204Google Scholar). 4) Lastly, composite elements bind both the receptor and non-receptor transcription factors and mediate either stimulation or repression of transcription depending on the composition of other transcription factors bound nearby (15Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Google Scholar, 16Zhang X.K. Dong J.M. Chiu J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8248-8254Google Scholar, 17Pearce D. Matsui W. Miner J.N. Yamamoto K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30081-30085Google Scholar). Much has been learned about the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by the steroid receptors through the functional analysis of both naturally occurring (18Kaspar F. Klocker H. Denninger A. Cato A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7850-7858Google Scholar, 19Geller D.S. Farhi A. Pinkerton N. Fradley M. Moritz M. Spitzer A. Meinke G. Tsai F.T. Sigler P.B. Lifton R.P. Science. 2000; 289: 119-123Google Scholar) and artificially constructed (7Liu W. Wang J. Yu G. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406Google Scholar, 20Starr D.B. Matsui W. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1271-1283Google Scholar) mutant receptors at these various types of HREs. In particular, some receptor functions can be reconstituted by isolated structural motifs that are transferable from the receptor to a heterologous context (21Godowski P.J. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1988; 241: 812-816Google Scholar,22Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Google Scholar). Other functions require multiple receptor domains and are disrupted by elimination of any significant amount of receptor sequence. For example, trans-repression at composite or tethering sites is lost if either of the receptor N- or C-terminal sequences is deleted (6Meijer O.C. Williamson A. Dallman M.F. Pearce D. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2000; 12: 245-254Google Scholar, 7Liu W. Wang J. Yu G. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406Google Scholar, 14Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K.K. Cato A.C. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 1189-1204Google Scholar). In contrast, MR or GR deleted of its C terminus containing the ligand-binding domain and activation function-2 motif strongly stimulates transcription of genes linked to simple or compound HREs even in the absence of agonists (23Godowski P.J. Rusconi S. Miesfeld R. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1987; 325: 365-368Google Scholar,24Govindan M.V. Warriar N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24439-24447Google Scholar), whereas the deletion of the N-terminal activation function-1 motif markedly diminishes activation at simple but not compound HREs (7Liu W. Wang J. Yu G. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406Google Scholar, 8Rupprecht R. Arriza J.L. Spengler D. Reul J.M. Evans R.M. Holsboer F. Damm K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 597-603Google Scholar,12Liu W. Wang J. Sauter N.K. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12480-12484Google Scholar). Recently, derivatives of jellyfish green fluorescent protein (GFP) have been used effectively as tags to examine the subcellular distribution of a variety of proteins including steroid and nuclear receptors (1Fejes-Toth G.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4363-4368Google Scholar). Interestingly, in contrast to GR, MR is both nuclear and cytoplasmic in the absence of hormone in many cell types (1Fejes-Toth G. Pearce D. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2973-2978Google Scholar), although it is excluded from the nucleolus. Upon hormone addition, the remaining extranuclear MR accumulates in the nucleus, and a striking alteration in nuclear organization occurs. The receptors coalesce into 1500–4500 clusters, each containing ∼10–50 MR molecules that remain excluded from the nucleolus (1Fejes-Toth G. Pearce D. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2973-2978Google Scholar). A similar pattern of subnuclear organization has been observed for GR in the presence of agonists, however, GR is almost entirely cytoplasmic in the absence of hormone (2Htun H. Barsony J. Renyi I. Gould D.L. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4845-4850Google Scholar, 30Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Google Scholar). The role of subnuclear localization and organization in transcriptional regulatory behavior and the determinants of cluster formation remain poorly understood not only for MR but for other nuclear receptors as well. Previous studies have characterized steroid receptor nuclear localization signals (30Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Google Scholar, 31Ylikomi T. Bocquel M.T. Berry M. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3681-3694Google Scholar), however, the role of determinants other than that of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) on receptor accumulation and retention remains poorly understood. Furthermore, the functional determinants of clustering and, in particular, its relationship to DNA binding and activation of gene transcription are unknown. Therefore, we set out to characterize the determinants of subnuclear distribution of MR and to relate these to the determinants of receptor transcriptional activity by examining the nuclear distribution pattern and transcriptional activities of a series of MR mutants. Construction of the GFP-MR plasmid (pEGFP-rMR), containing sequences encoding fluorescence-enhanced jellyfish GFP (8Rupprecht R. Arriza J.L. Spengler D. Reul J.M. Evans R.M. Holsboer F. Damm K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 597-603Google Scholar) fused to full-length rat MR (11Trapp T. Rupprecht R. Castren M. Reul J.M. Holsboer F. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1457-1462Google Scholar) in plasmid pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA, see Ref. 26Chen S.Y. Wang J. Liu W. Pearce D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C39-46Google Scholar), has been described. In the resulting fusion protein, the C terminus of EGFP is coupled to the N terminus of full-length MR through a Ser-Gly-Leu-Arg-Ser sequence. Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)- tagged MR derivatives were similarly generated using the vectors pEYFP-C1 and pECFP-C1 (CLONTECH), respectively. In all cases, the autofluorescent proteins are N-terminal to the MR sequences. Truncated or point-mutated MR derivatives (shown in Fig. 1) were generated as follows. pEGFP-MR/R643D and pEGFP-MR/D645R were made by replacingBamHI-XhoI fragment in pEGFP-MR withBamHI-XhoI fragment of 6RMR/R643D and 6RMR/D645R, respectively. These point mutants were generated using PCR as described previously (7Liu W. Wang J. Yu G. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406Google Scholar). Construction of the MR expression vector 6RMR is also described previously (5Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Google Scholar). The MR N-terminal deletion derivative (pEGFP-MRΔN) was obtained by removing theBglII-BamHI fragment containing the entire MR N terminus from pEGFP-MR and re-ligating to preserve an in-frame fusion to GFP. The C-terminal deletion derivative (pEGFP-MR/ΔC) was made by transferring rat MR N-terminal and DBD sequences from 6RMRΔC into the vector pEGFP-C1. PEGFP-MR/DBD was made by removing the MR N terminus as a BglII-BglII fragment from pEGFP-MRΔC and re-ligating after filling in with Klenow DNA polymerase I large fragment to retain the appropriate reading frame. pEGFP-MR/C604S and pEGFP-MR/C607S were obtained by following steps. First, the point mutations in the MR DBD were introduced using PCR with primers containing the appropriate point mutations as well as theBglII site naturally occurring just before the DBD region; the resulting PCR fragment digested with BglII andXhoI replaced the BglII-XhoI fragment of the pEGFP-MR. Monkey kidney CV1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum in monolayers on small glass coverslips. To avoid the influence of possible steroid contamination originating from the serum, cells were grown in medium containing fetal bovine serum, which was charcoal-stripped four times. According to our measurements, this procedure eliminates >99% of glucocorticoids present in serum. Transient transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE with 20 ng of the GFP/YFP/CFP-MR plasmid/coverslip. Expression of GFP-fusion proteins in CV1 cells was confirmed by immunoblotting using standard methods as described previously (32Chen S.-Y. Bhargava A. Mastroberardino L. Meijer O.C. Wang J. Buse P.

Immunoblots were probed using living colors monoclonal antibody JL-8 against GFP (CLONTECH) at 1:1000 dilution, and detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence using sheep anti-mouse Ig horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). CV1 cells were transfected with 50 ng of TAT3-luciferase (TAT3-LUC) and 50 ng TAT1-CAT reporters and 500 ng of pEGFP-rMR or appropriate mutant as described previously (1Fejes-Toth G. Pearce D. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2973-2978Google Scholar, 7Liu W. Wang J. Yu G. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406Google Scholar). Activities of fluorescence-tagged proteins were compared with those of the corresponding untagged MR proteins as described previously (1Fejes-Toth G. Pearce D. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2973-2978Google Scholar). 20 ng of Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactisodase plasmid was included as an internal control, and the BlueScript KS vector plasmid was used as a carrier to bring total amount of DNA to 1 μg. Fresh medium containing 5% stripped serum was added to cells 18 h before transfection, and the cells were transfected using 1 ml of Opti-MEM I-reduced serum medium containing LipofectAMINE-DNA complex and incubated at 37 °C. 5 h later, 1 ml of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% stripped fetal bovine serum was added without removing the transfection mixture, and the cells were kept at 30 °C. 16 h later, the medium containing 10−8maldosterone was added to one of two identical transfections. 24 h later, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase and CAT activity as described previously (1Fejes-Toth G. Pearce D. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2973-2978Google Scholar, 7Liu W. Wang J. Yu G. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406Google Scholar). 6–18 h after transfection with MR constructs, the medium was replaced with one containing no serum, and the coverslips were placed into a heated chamber under the fluorescence microscope. The cells were kept at 37 °C during microscopy. The chamber was perfused with culture medium (control period) followed by MR agonists or antagonists as specified below. Fluorescence images were captured on a PXL-cooled CCD camera (Photometrics) attached to a Olympus IMT2 microscope equipped with an epifluorescence attachment and standard fluorescein isothiocyanate, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylidole, and Texas Red filter sets using a × 60 planapo objective (N.A. 1.4, Nikon). For fluorescence confocal microscopy, a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 laser-scanning confocal system was used. We previously demonstrated that agonists increase MR nuclear predominance and cause a marked change in its subnuclear distribution. To determine the relationship between MR activity and its subnuclear distribution, we examined the transcriptional activity and localization of a series of MR deletion and point mutants (shown schematically in Fig. 1, A and B) fused to jellyfish autofluorescent proteins. We first examined the transcriptional activities of the fusion proteins to confirm that their functional characteristics reflected those of their untagged counterparts. As shown in Figs. 2,A and B, GFP-MR gave strong hormone-dependent activation of reporter genes driven by either one HRE (TAT1-CAT) or three HREs (TAT3-luciferase) as shown previously (1Fejes-Toth G. Pearce D. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2973-2978Google Scholar, 7Liu W. Wang J. Yu G. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406Google Scholar). We next tested the mutants to be used in the localization studies. In all cases, the behavior of the GFP-fusion derivative was qualitatively similar to that of the untagged version (Ref. 1Fejes-Toth G. Pearce D. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2973-2978Google Scholar, and data not shown). Aldosterone-induced transcriptional activity was only seen at very high hormone levels when receptors were not cotransfected (>10−7m, data not shown) presumably because of the activation of small amounts of GR present in the cells (5Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Google Scholar). Finally, GFP-MR-immunoreactive proteins were characterized by immunoblot using anti-GFP antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The fusion proteins were all made and were of expected sizes (data not shown), and although the truncated proteins were expressed at higher levels than the full-length proteins, all of the full-length proteins were expressed at comparable levels including the transcriptionally non-functional MR/C604S. As addressed under “Discussion,” it seems improbable that differences in activity or subcellular localization were the result of differences in expression levels. We next examined the cellular distribution of the fusion proteins in the presence and absence of hormone. We began with the MR N-terminal deletion derivative (MRΔN). The transcriptional behavior of this MR mutant is very similar to wild type MR in some regards but is strikingly different in others. In particular, as shown in Fig. 2,A and B, MRΔN stimulates transcription in a hormone-dependent fashion with activity comparable to that of wild type at genes driven by multimerized “simple” HREs, such as TAT3 (Fig. 2B), but activates transcription poorly from a single HRE, like TAT1 (Fig. 2A) (7Liu W. Wang J. Yu G. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406Google Scholar). Moreover, in addition to the activation function-1 transcriptional activation function, the receptor N terminus is a key determinant of steroid receptor-mediated repression of transcription (5Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Google Scholar, 6Meijer O.C. Williamson A. Dallman M.F. Pearce D. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2000; 12: 245-254Google Scholar). Hence, it was interesting to examine the distribution of this mutant and compare it with wild type MR to determine whether selective abrogation of MR activities associated with the N terminus would influence its nuclear distribution. CV1 cells were cotransfected with YFP-tagged MRΔN and CFP-tagged wild type MR and prepared for epifluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3A, in the absence of hormone, MRΔN was found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in a pattern qualitatively similar to wild type. Aldosterone triggered a rapid increase in nuclear predominance and reconfiguration of the mutant receptor into clusters (Fig. 3B) also in a manner similar to wild type (data not shown, and Ref. 1Fejes-Toth G. Pearce D. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2973-2978Google Scholar). However, unlike wild type receptor, MRΔN showed a striking tendency to accumulate in a perinucleolar distribution (Fig. 3B). MRΔN enters the nucleoli and other structures from which the unliganded wild type MR is excluded. Importantly, the mutant receptor segregated into distinct clusters in the presence of the agonist but not of the antagonist (data not shown), although the clusters were less prominent than those observed with the wild type MR. We next examined the distribution pattern of a C-terminal deletion mutant (MRΔC) fused to GFP. This derivative like the analogous derivative of the GR is constitutively active (i.e.stimulates transcription in the absence of hormone) in some contexts. In particular, it stimulates the transcription of genes linked to simple HREs (Fig. 2, and Refs. 7Liu W. Wang J. Yu G. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406Google Scholar and 8Rupprecht R. Arriza J.L. Spengler D. Reul J.M. Evans R.M. Holsboer F. Damm K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 597-603Google Scholar). However, unlike the wild type receptor, this mutant does not repress gene transcription, consistent with the idea that determinants in both the N and C termini are required for the repression of gene transcription (6Meijer O.C. Williamson A. Dallman M.F. Pearce D. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2000; 12: 245-254Google Scholar, 14Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K.K. Cato A.C. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 1189-1204Google Scholar). The nuclear localization and pattern of nuclear accumulation of GFP-MRΔC was examined by epifluorescence microscopy in the absence and presence of aldosterone. As shown in Fig. 4, MRΔC was found almost entirely in the nucleus in the absence of hormone, and as expected, its distribution was unaffected by hormone (data not shown). Importantly, in both the presence and absence of aldosterone, the receptor was found in subnuclear clusters indistinguishable from those seen with wild type receptor in the presence of aldosterone. Hence, the accumulation of MR into clusters is linked to receptor activation; it is not dependent on the ligand-binding domain and is not attributed to any direct effect of hormone per se. It is clear from the above observations that MR, deleted of either its N- or C-terminal activation function, still translocates to the nucleus and forms clusters that are morphologically similar to those formed by wild type, although additionally, MRΔN but not MRΔC accumulates in a perinucleolar pattern. Two major reasons were considered for the similarity between wild type and mutant clusters. 1) The key determinants of cluster formation and nuclear localization are contained within the DBD, and both N- and C-terminal regions are dispensable. 2) N- and C-terminal regions are redundant, and one but not both is required. To determine whether the DBD and NLS alone are sufficient to direct nuclear localization and cluster formation, we next examined the distribution of the GFP-tagged MR DBD fragment (Fig.1). As with all of the steroid receptors, this derivative of MR can bind to DNA but has very low transcriptional activity (Fig. 2,A and B). As shown in Fig.5, GFP-MR/DBD, like GFP-MRΔC, is entirely nuclear in the absence of hormone, consistent with observations with other steroid receptors that a nuclear localization signal is found within the DBD (30Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Google Scholar, 31Ylikomi T. Bocquel M.T. Berry M. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3681-3694Google Scholar, 33Simental J.A. Sar M. Lane M.V. French F.S. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 510-518Google Scholar). Note also that a canonical NLS is present at the C-terminal end of the MR DBD (Fig.1B). However, the pattern of nuclear distribution of the DBD alone is quite different from that of wild type or MRΔN (in the presence of hormone) or of MRΔC (in the absence or presence of hormone). First, it displays prominent nucleolar localization. Second, although its distribution within the nucleus is not completely homogenous, clusters reminiscent of those formed by the wild type MR are conspicuously absent. Furthermore, the nuclear distribution of the GFP-MR/DBD consistently parallels chromatin density as revealed by Hoechst staining (data not shown). This is in sharp contrast to the clusters formed by the wild type MR, which are excluded from regions of condensed chromatin, rather showing a predilection for the regions of transcriptionally active euchromatin (1Fejes-Toth G. Pearce D. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2973-2978Google Scholar). The lack of cluster formation is reminiscent of the wild type MR in the presence of the antagonist. However, antagonist-bound wild type MR is still excluded from the nucleolus, in striking contrast to MR/DBD. Further supporting the idea that cluster formation is linked to receptor competence to stimulate gene transcription is the observation that an MR mutation, which renders it capable of activating but not repressing transcription (20Starr D.B. Matsui W. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1271-1283Google Scholar), forms wild type clusters (data not shown), We next wanted to examine the role of DNA binding on nuclear localization and cluster formation. MR and GR, together with the progesterone and androgen receptors, form a subgroup within the nuclear receptor superfamily that binds to overlapping palindromic DNA response elements and has homologous DNA-binding domains. Within this region are determinants of both protein-DNA interaction (within the first zinc finger, ZF1) and dimerization (within the second zinc finger, ZF2) as shown schematically in Fig. 1B. The ZF2 dimer interface stabilizes receptor DNA binding to some but not all palindromic sites (7Liu W. Wang J. Yu G. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406Google Scholar, 18Kaspar F. Klocker H. Denninger A. Cato A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7850-7858Google Scholar), whereas an α-helix within ZF1 intercalates into the major groove of the HRE and is essential for DNA binding (34Green S. Chambon P. Nature. 1987; 325: 75-78Google Scholar, 35Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Google Scholar). The above observations suggested that the receptor DBD and associated NLS aresufficient to mediate nuclear localization but not cluster formation. To examine whether DNA binding is necessary for stable nuclear localization and cluster formation, we next examined the effect of mutations that disrupt the DBD dimer interface on receptor distribution in response to aldosterone. As shown in Fig.6, the behavior of the dimer mutant, GFP-MR/R643D is very similar to that of the wild type MR, despite its strikingly different behavior at two different types of HRE (Fig. 2,A and B). Notably, the clusters formed by MR/R643D in the presence of aldosterone demonstrated the same dynamic characteristics as those formed by wild type. An addition of an excess of the MR antagonist ZK91587 caused rapid transformation of MR from a clustered to a diffuse pattern (Fig. 6) (data not shown, and Ref. 1Fejes-Toth G. Pearce D. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2973-2978Google Scholar). The distribution of another salt bridge mutant GFP-MR/D645R was also indistinguishable from that of wild type MR (data not shown). We conclude from these results that nuclear localization and cluster formation do not require the DBD dimer interface and may not require specific DNA binding. However, it is important to note that the disruption of the DBD dimer interface disrupts MR and GR DNA binding and activity at only a subset of HREs. Indeed, dimer mutants of either MR or GR bind to compound elements (composed of multiple HREs in tandem) with affinity similar to that of wild type, and interestingly, their activity at such sites is greater than that of wild type MR (7Liu W. Wang J. Yu G. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the dimer interface mutations do not interfere with receptor-mediated repression, and the replacement of the wild type GR gene with a GR dimer mutant is non-lethal in mice in contrast to GR deletion, which is uniformly lethal (36Cole T.J. Blendy J.A. Monaghan A.P. Krieglstein K. Schmid W. Aguzzi A. Fantuzzi G. Hummler E. Unsicker K. Schutz G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1608-1621Google Scholar, 37Reichardt H.M. Kaestner K.H. Tuckermann J. Kretz O. Wessely O. Bock R. Gass P. Schmid W. Herrlich P. Angel P. Schutz G. Cell. 1998; 93: 531-541Google Scholar). Hence, the disruption of the DBD dimer interface interaction surface imparts a complex phenotype, and the dimer mutants do not reflect the simple abrogation of DNA binding (7Liu W. Wang J. Yu G. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406Google Scholar, 18Kaspar F. Klocker H. Denninger A. Cato A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7850-7858Google Scholar). With the above observations in mind, we next wanted to examine the effect on nuclear localization and organization of completely destabilizing the receptor-DNA interaction. Therefore, we examined the cellular distribution of MR mutants that were unable to bind DNA because of disruption of the zinc coordination motif of the first zinc finger within the DBD (Fig. 1B). This mutant fails to stimulate transcription at either a single (TAT1) or compound (TAT3) HRE (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 7, distribution in cytoplasm and nucleus of the mutant MR/C604S in the absence of hormone is similar to that of wild type MR. However, although aldosterone drives the remaining receptor into the nucleus with a similar time course to that of wild type, MR/C604S forms clusters in the presence of aldosterone that are markedly different from those formed by wild type MR, both in their morphology and in their fewer numbers. Another DNA-binding-deficient MR, GFP-MR/C607S, behaved very similarly to GFP-MR/C604S (data not shown). The wild type MR undergoes not only a change in cellular distribution in response to agonists (26Chen S.Y. Wang J. Liu W. Pearce D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C39-46Google Scholar) but forms distinct subnuclear clusters that are correlated with the activated state of the receptor (1Fejes-Toth G. Pearce D. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2973-2978Google Scholar). Importantly, although both agonists and antagonists induce nuclear localization of the receptor, only agonists induce clustering, implying an association between cluster formation and the active conformation of the receptor. By characterizing a series of mutants designed to selectively disrupt various receptor functions, our present study offers insight into the functional determinants of MR subnuclear organization and the relationship between nuclear distribution and activity. One of the most striking findings presented here is that the C-terminally deleted MR is not only localized predominantly to the nucleus in the absence of hormone, but that it forms clusters indistinguishable from those formed by wild type MR in the presence of agonists but not antagonists. We have shown previously that the C-terminally deleted MR does not repress transcription under conditions where the full-length does. However, like its close relative, the GR, this MR mutant does bind to DNA and stimulates a reporter gene driven by simple HREs (7Liu W. Wang J. Yu G. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406Google Scholar). Indeed, the receptor C-terminal domain appears to provide a general inactivation function that is released by hormone and that can be transferred to other transcription factors and indeed other unrelated proteins (38Picard D. Salser S.J. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 1073-1080Google Scholar). However, as witnessed by the failure of receptor derivatives lacking this function to repress transcription, it is clear that this is not the sole function of the ligand-binding domain. Indeed, other functions have been clearly localized to the steroid receptor ligand-binding domain including an activation function (most often referred to as “AF2”), nuclear localization signal, and coregulator interaction domains (22Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Google Scholar, 30Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Google Scholar, 39Hong H. Kohli K. Trivedi A. Johnson D.L. Stallcup M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4948-4952Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the DBD fragment including the NLS was strongly localized to the nucleus, it did not form clusters. These data suggest that although the DBD is sufficient to mediate nuclear localization, cluster formation requires either N- or C-terminal sequences but not both to be present. Importantly, the DNA-binding-deficient mutant MR/C604S does aggregate into clusters (Fig. 7), although they are abnormal in morphology and number, consistent with the idea that wild type clusters require DNA binding for appropriate targeting and interreceptor interactions through either N- or C-terminal sequences for aggregation. Aggregation can occur in the absence of DNA binding, but aggregates are abnormal presumably because DNA targeting is absent or abnormal. In contrast, the normal morphology of the clusters formed by dimerization-deficient mutants (Fig. 6) (1Fejes-Toth G. Pearce D. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2973-2978Google Scholar) indicates that the interaction through this motif is not required for aggregation, nor is binding to single palindromic HREs. MR dimer mutants bind to compound HREs (i.e. HREs consisting of multiple palindromic receptor binding sites) with an affinity similar to that of wild type (7Liu W. Wang J. Yu G. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406Google Scholar), and their nonspecific DNA binding is indistinguishable from wild type, 2D. Pearce, unpublished results. however, their binding to single palindromic HREs is poor. It is also possible, but seems less likely, that the C604S mutation disrupts a function of the DBD unrelated to DNA binding that is required for cluster formation (e.g. interaction with the nuclear matrix). One striking difference between the subnuclear localization of MRΔN and either wild type MR or MRΔC is the prominent perinucleolar signal that this mutant demonstrates, consistent with localization to the perinucleolar compartment. Although this difference is not seen in all cell types (for example, it was found in CV1 cells but not in RCCT cells, data not shown), it suggests that the N terminus may exclude the receptor from the perinucleolar compartment. It should also be noted that the perinucleolar accumulation of MRΔN was not induced by the MR antagonist ZK91587, indicating that this accumulation like cluster formation is a function of the activated receptor. The perinucleolar compartment is a site of active transcription and RNA metabolism, although the enrichment of MRΔN at these sites is of uncertain significance. It seems unlikely that any of the differences in receptor behavior are because of differences in expression levels among the various mutants, although this possibility must be considered since the truncated derivatives were expressed at higher levels than the full-length receptors (data not shown). Importantly, the truncated derivatives were all expressed comparably to each other as were the full-length receptors to each other, and none of the differences in activity or cellular localization, such as perinucleolar accumulation of MRΔN or a lack of cluster formation of MR/DBD and MR/C604S, segregated according to receptor size. Furthermore, in a series of transfections of MR/DBD in which the expression level varied over more than a 20-fold range, there was no change in the underlying pattern, only in the signal intensity (data not shown). Hence, it seems most likely that the differences in receptor behavior are because of inherent differences in their function, not expression levels. Taken together, the above observations suggest that the clusters represent higher order receptor complexes organized on HRE multimers. Particularly relevant to this conclusion is the indistinguishable appearance of clusters formed by wild type and dimer mutant MRs in live cells (Figs. 4 and 6) (1Fejes-Toth G. Pearce D. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2973-2978Google Scholar) and the ability of both to form higher order complexes at HRE multimers in vitro (7Liu W. Wang J. Yu G. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406Google Scholar). Also consistent with this interpretation, GFP-labeled wild type GR was recently shown to form chromatin-associated aggregates at an artificial array of murine mammary tumor virus GREs (40McNally J.G. Muller W.G. Walker D. Wolford R. Hager G.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1262-1265Google Scholar). An exchange between this array and the nucleoplasmic compartment was rapid, similar to our observations for wild type clusters (1Fejes-Toth G. Pearce D. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2973-2978Google Scholar). In contrast to the forgoing, it remains possible that clusters occur at nonspecific DNA sites and assist in the rapid deployment of MR to a network of regulated genes present in poised or transcriptionally active chromatin (3DeFranco D.B. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 1-24Google Scholar). Further work will be needed to clarify this issue and to determine with certainty the precise nature and role of the prominent nuclear clusters formed by MR.

Chem. 1989; 264: 14755-14761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mihara K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 1022-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Recently, a third Scd gene, Scd3, has been identified in mouse (12Zheng Y. Prouty S.M. Harmon A. Sundberg J.P. Stenn K.S. Parimoo S. Genomics. 2001; 71: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although the proteins encoded by these three genes show >87% sequence homology, they exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns, and transcriptional regulation, likely because of marked difference in their promoter sequences. However, in the human,SCD is expressed as a single gene that yields two transcripts, 3.9 and 5.2 kb in size, resulting from the alternative usage of polyadenylation sites present in the 3′-untranslated region (13Zhang L. Ge L. Parimoo S. Stenn K. Prouty S.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Both transcripts encode the same functionally active 359-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 41.5 kDa. The humanSCD promoter region has recently been characterized, and this gene is transcriptionally regulated by sterol regulatory binding protein, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and cholesterol (14Zhang L. Ge L. Tran T. Stenn K. Prouty S.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,15Bene H. Lasky D. Ntambi J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that the expression of SCD in human retinal pigment epithelial cells is regulated by retinoic acid (16Samuel W. Kutty R.K. Nagineni S. Gordon J.S. Prouty S.M. Chandraratna R.A. Wiggert B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28744-28750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a polarized monolayer of highly differentiated epithelial cells, situated between the neurosensory retina and the vascularized choroid (17Bok D. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 17: 189-195Crossref Google Scholar). It forms part of the blood-retinal barrier and is important for homeostasis of the outer retina. RPE cells provide nutrients to the photoreceptor cells and carry out phagocytosis and degradation of rod outer segment tips undergoing circadian shedding. These cells are also able to produce a variety of cytokines, which may play a role not only in the development, differentiation, and survival of retinal cells but also in several intraocular pathological conditions (18Hicks D. Bugra K. Faucheux B. Jeanny J.C. Laurent M. Malecaze F. Mascarelli F. Raulais D. Cohen Y. Courtois Y. Osborne N.N. Chader G.J. Progress in Retinal Research.

Among these cytokines is transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), an anti-inflammatory growth factor that plays a pivotal role in ocular diseases such as proliferative vitreoretinopathy and age-related macular degeneration (20Connor Jr., T.B. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Danielpour D. Dart L.L. Michels R.G. de Bustros S. Enger C. Kato H. Lansing M. Hayashi H. Glaser B.M. J. Clin.

Ophthalmol. 1997; 81: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). It is thus of interest to know whether this cytokine regulates SCD expression. The TGF-β family comprises a large group of multifunctional cytokines with widespread distribution. They have a broad range of biological effects including cell growth, differentiation, wound healing, apoptosis, immunomodulation, and stimulation of extracellular matrix formation (22Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1990: 419-472Google Scholar, 23Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). There are three mammalian TGF-β-isoforms, TGF-β1, TGF-β2 and TGF-β3, that are encoded by different genes located on different chromosomes. They propagate signals generally through two related transmembrane proteins called TGF-β receptors type I and type II (24Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). Signals from these cell-surface receptors, members of the serine-threonine kinase family, to the nucleus are transduced via structurally related cytoplasmic proteins called Smads (25Baker J.C. Harland R.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 26Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar). There are three Smad subfamilies: receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), common mediator Smads, and inhibitory or antagonistic Smads (anti-Smads). The receptor-regulated Smads, Smad2 and Smad3, are transiently and specifically regulated by phosphorylation mediated through TGF-β receptors (27Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Following phosphorylation, R-Smads form a complex with the common mediator Smad, Smad4, and then translocate into the nucleus to regulate the transcription of target genes (28Abdollah S. Macias-Silva M. Tsukazaki T. Hayashi H. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27678-27685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 29Nakao A. Imamura T.

Derynck R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 270-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The antagonistic Smads, Smad6 and Smad7, on the other hand, inhibit the phosphorylation of R-Smads by the TGF-β receptors and prevent the association of the R-Smads with Smad4 (31Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 32Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R.

In this study we have demonstrated for the first time thatSCD expression is induced by TGF-β and that this induction is mediated through a signal transduction pathway involving Smad proteins. Recombinant human TGF-β1–β3, activin A, inhibin A, bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4), and anti-human TGF-β1 polyclonal antibody were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-human Smad2 and anti-human phospho-Smad2 (Ser-465/467) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Human recombinant IL-1α, IL-1β, and basic fibroblast growth factor were obtained from Collaborative Research (Bedford, MA). Human recombinant interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, platelet-derived growth factor, and Lumi-LightPLUS Western blotting kit were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Actinomycin D and anti-FLAG® M2 monoclonal antibody were purchased from Sigma. Cultures of primary human retinal pigment epithelial (HRPE) cells were established from explants derived from human donor eyes as described previously (33Nagineni C.N. Detrick B. Hooks J.J. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1994; 1: 569-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells grown in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (Fungizone, 250 ng/ml). Cells were grown to confluence in a complete medium, and the cultured cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and allowed to grow overnight in the same medium. The culture medium was replaced next day with fresh serum-free medium and was incubated in serum-free medium with or without TGF-β and other cytokines for the indicated time intervals. All experiments were performed with cells between passages 6 and 12. Human corneal epithelial cells (HCE-T), corneal and choroidal fibroblasts (HCRF, HCHF), and human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5) were grown in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Human breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-468), and hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2) were also grown in the same medium as described above. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified environment of 5% CO2. Replication-deficient recombinant adenoviral vectors expressing FLAG-tagged full-length murine Smad4 and Smad7 under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter were used (34Fujii M. Takeda K. Imamura T. Aoki H. Sampath T.K. Enomoto S. Kawabata M. Kato M. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3801-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The optimal multiplicity of infection was determined using a lacZcontrol virus. Adenoviral stocks propagated in 293T cells were used to infect, MDA-MB-468 or HepG2 cells, respectively, for Smad4 and Smad7. Based on the β-galactosidase assay, both cells were infected with the corresponding adenoviral constructs at a multiplicity of infection of 100. The medium was changed after 3 h post-infection, and the cells were allowed to grow for 24 h. The cells were serum-starved overnight and treated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) for various time points, and SCD mRNA expression was analyzed. Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using RNAzol B RNA isolation kit (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). Equal amounts of RNA samples were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing 2% formaldehyde. The RNA bands from the gel were transferred to a Nytran membrane by capillary blotting (Schleicher & Schuell). Equal loadings of the gel and equal transfer efficiency of RNA samples were verified by ethidium bromide staining of 28 and 18 S rRNAs on the gel and the membrane. The cDNA probe for SCD was generated by reverse transcription-PCR from human brain RNA as described previously (16Samuel W. Kutty R.K. Nagineni S. Gordon J.S. Prouty S.M. Chandraratna R.A. Wiggert B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28744-28750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The identity of the amplification product was confirmed by sequencing, and its sequence was found to be identical to base pairs 198–710 of the SCD cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession no.AF097514). The cDNA probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and hybridized to the blot using QuickHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Hybridization and washing were done according to the manufacturer's protocol. The blot was exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film. The relative expression ofSCD was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Normalization of the signal intensity was done using the intensity of ethidium bromide-stained 18 S rRNA band. Membranes were stripped and reprobed with glyceladehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe (CLONTECH) when necessary. Oleic acid formation in HRPE cells was estimated as described previously (16Samuel W. Kutty R.K. Nagineni S. Gordon J.S. Prouty S.M. Chandraratna R.A. Wiggert B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28744-28750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were grown in 100-mm culture dishes treated with TGF-β (5 ng/ml) for 12 h. [1-14C]Stearic acid in fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin was added at this time, and the cells were allowed to grow for an additional 6 h. The cells were washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and then harvested in 2.0 ml of phosphate-buffered saline by the use of a rubber policeman. Cells were homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem glass homogenizer; lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1) by vortexing and centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min. The lipid phase at the bottom was collected, dried under argon, and analyzed for fatty acids using HPLC. The lipids were solubilized, saponified, and derivatized. The resulting samples were analyzed using a Hewlett-Packard HP1090 HPLC on a 4.6 × 250-mm, 5.0-μm C8 Supelco column in line with Packard A500 radiometric flow scintillation counter. The derivatized fatty acids were detected by absorbance at 250 nm. Individual fatty acids were identified by using labeled and unlabeled standards. Radioactive oleic acid was detected and quantified using Packard FLO-ONE software. The cultured human RPE cells with or without TGF-β treatment were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and cell extracts were prepared as described previously (35Kutty R.K. Nagineni C.N. Kutty G. Hooks J.J. Chader G.J. Wiggert B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of the cell extracts were quantified using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Equal amounts of total protein (50 μg) from each sample were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10–20% Tricine gels and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen). The membranes were incubated for 1 h with anti-human Smad2 or anti-phospho-Smad2 (Ser 465/467) antibody. An anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was used to detect the adenoviral expression of Smad4 or Smad7 in MDA-MB-468 and HepG2 cells, respectively. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:5000) was used as secondary antibody. Immunocomplexes were visualized by a chemiluminescence method using a Lumi-LightPLUS Western blotting kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). We studied the effect of TGF-β on SCD expression in HRPE cells in culture by Northern blot analysis. These cells have been shown previously to respond to TGF-β treatment (35Kutty R.K. Nagineni C.N. Kutty G. Hooks J.J. Chader G.J. Wiggert B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 36Kutty R.K. Kutty G. Hooks J.J. Wiggert B. Nagineni C.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 386-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The expression of both SCD transcripts (3.9 and 5.2 kb) were greatly increased in HRPE cells treated with TGF-β1 for 24 h (Fig.1A). We also studied the effect of other growth factors and cytokines, such as interferon-γ, IL-1β, IL-1α, tumor necrosis factor-α, TGF-α, basic fibroblast growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor. However, unlike TGF-β1, none of these agents were effective inducers ofSCD mRNA expression. The increased SCDmRNA expression induced by TGF-β1 was effectively blocked by a neutralizing anti-TGF-β1 antibody preparation (Fig. 1B). Thus, the observed effect was not because of any contaminant present in the TGF-β1 preparation. The effect of different TGF-β isoforms, β1, β2 and β3, onSCD mRNA expression was analyzed in HRPE cells (Fig.2A). Expression of bothSCD transcripts was increased with all three TGF-β isoforms. The effect of other TGF-β family members on SCDmRNA expression was also studied (Fig. 2B). Unlike TGF-β, BMP-4, activin A, and inhibin A were unable to induceSCD mRNA expression. This result clearly demonstrates the specificity of TGF-β on SCD mRNA expression in HRPE cells. The effects of concentration and time on TGF-β-induced SCDmRNA expression were analyzed (Fig.3). The expression of both SCDtranscripts increased with increasing concentrations of TGF-β1. More than a 3-fold increase over the base line in SCD expression was observed at the optimal TGF-β1 concentration of 5 ng/ml. The increase in SCD mRNA expression induced by TGF-β1 was also time-dependent. Expression was increased within 2 h, and the maximum was observed at 18 h following treatment with TGF-β1. SCD expression was not changed in untreated cells used as controls for the various time points (data not shown). It was of interest to see whether the TGF-β1-induced increase inSCD mRNA expression in HRPE cells is translated into a corresponding increase in SCD enzyme activity. SCD enzyme activity was measured in HRPE cells in culture. Cells were incubated with [1-14C]stearic acid for 6 h following a 12-h treatment with 5 ng/ml TGF-β1. The lipids extracted from the cells were analyzed for oleic acid formation using HPLC. As shown in Fig.4, the oleic acid formation in HRPE cells was increased to 216% after TGF-β1 treatment. As expected, the treatment also resulted in an ∼4-fold increase in SCDmRNA expression. This result shows that the increasedSCD mRNA expression induced by TGF-β1 in HRPE cells is associated with an increase in SCD enzyme activity. The effect of TGF-β1 on SCDmRNA expression was studied in various types of human cells in culture (Fig. 5). Apart from HRPE cells, the increased SCD mRNA expression induced by TGF-β1 was also observed in ARPE-19, a well characterized human RPE cell line (37Dunn K.C. Aotaki-Keen A.E. Putkey F.R. Hjelmeland L.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). We then tested cells derived from sources other than RPE. The TGF-β1-induced elevation in SCD mRNA expression was also noted in corneal epithelial cells, corneal fibroblasts, choroidal fibroblasts, and lung fibroblasts. However, there was no appreciable induction of SCD mRNA expression in human amniotic epithelial cell line (WISH), where the basal expression level was already high. Thus, the regulation of SCD mRNA expression by TGF-β1 is not limited to RPE cells but rather is present in multiple cell types. The effect of actinomycin D, an intercalating transcriptional inhibitor, on TGF-β1-inducedSCD mRNA expression was studied (Fig.6). HRPE cells were treated with TGF-β in the presence of indicated concentrations of actinomycin D. Essentially complete inhibition of TGF-β1-induced increase inSCD mRNA expression is found even at 1 ng/ml, the lowest concentration of actinomycin D. Thus, the regulation of SCDmRNA expression by TGF-β appears to occur at the level of transcription rather than through stabilization of the message. TGF-β signals from the cell surface to the nucleus are transduced by Smads 2, 3, and 4, and phosphorylation of Smad2 is often crucial for this downstream signaling cascade (27Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 28Abdollah S. Macias-Silva M. Tsukazaki T. Hayashi H. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27678-27685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Cell extracts from HRPE cells, treated with TGF-β (5 ng/ml) at various time points, were analyzed by Western blotting for phosphorylated Smad2 (upper panel) and total Smad2 (lower panel) using an anti-phospho-Smad2 antibody and an anti-Smad2 antibody, respectively (Fig.7). The ∼58-kDa Smad2 protein was present in both control and TGF-β-treated HRPE cells, and an increase in phosphorylated Smad2 was noticed within 20 min of TGF-β treatment. This increase in Smad2 phosphorylation was transient and lasted for up to 60 min. Thus, Smad2 phosphorylation in HRPE cells is increased shortly after TGF-β1 treatment, indicating that these cells can respond to the ligand through a Smad-dependent pathway. Overexpression of Smad7, an inhibitory Smad, has been shown to block TGF-β-induced cellular responses (38Hill-Kapturczak N. Truong L. Thamilselvan V. Visner G.A. Nick H.S. Agarwal A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40904-40909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 39Zhao J. Shi W. Chen H. Warburton D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23992-23997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To demonstrate further that the increase in SCD expression occurs through a TGF-β receptor-mediated mechanism, overexpression of Smad7 was used to abrogate the induction of this message. As shown in Fig. 8A, both SCDtranscripts were present in HepG2 cells, and their expression was up-regulated by TGF-β in a time-dependent manner. Smad7 overexpression was attained in these cells using an adenoviral construct. The overexpression of Smad7 was determined by Western blot using an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody to the FLAG epitope present in the construct (data not shown). TGF-β-induced SCD mRNA expression was completely abolished by Smad7 overexpression (Fig.8B). This result indicates that SCD expression induced by TGF-β is susceptible to inhibition by Smad7. Because the expression ofSCD is increased so substantially by TGF-β, and because HRPE cells can activate a Smad pathway following stimulation by TGF-β, we next sought to determine whether the increased expression of SCD by TGF-β requires the Smad pathway. Smad4, known as common partner Smad, is essential for the translocation of phosphorylated Smad2 and/or Smad3 to the nucleus, where these proteins regulate transcription of target genes (28Abdollah S.

The role of Smad4 in TGF-β-induced SCD mRNA expression was analyzed using a human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-468, deficient in Smad4 (40de Caestecker M.P. Hemmati P. Larisch-Bloch S. Ajmera R. Roberts A.B. Lechleider R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13690-13696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). TwoSCD transcripts (3.9 and 5.2 kb) were present in MDA-MB-468 cell line. However, no increase in SCD mRNA expression was observed in these cells as a result of TGF-β treatment (Fig.9A). This indicates that a signal transduction pathway involving Smad4 is likely to be necessary for the TGF-β1-induced SCD mRNA expression. If so, the overexpression of Smad4 should restore the TGF-β1 effect onSCD mRNA expression in the Smad4-deficient cell line.SCD mRNA expression was analyzed in MDA-MB-468 after overexpression of Smad4 using an adenoviral construct. Expression of exogenous Smad4 was demonstrated in infected cells by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody (data not shown). SCDmRNA expression was increased in a time-dependent manner by TGF-β in Smad4 overexpressed MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.9B). Thus, Smad4 is involved in the induction ofSCD mRNA expression by TGF-β. In the present study, we have shown for the first time that the expression of the SCD gene is regulated by TGF-β.SCD mRNA expression in cultured human RPE cells is induced by all three TGF-β isoforms found in mammals. Other TGF-β family members, however, and several other unrelated growth factors and cytokines failed to elicit this response. We further determined that the regulation of SCD mRNA expression by TGF-β is not limited to RPE cells. Several cell culture systems tested responded to TGF-β treatment by increasing the expression of SCDmRNA. The increase in SCD mRNA expression in TGF-β-treated HRPE cells was associated with an increase in SCD enzyme activity, as evidenced by the increased formation of oleic acid from stearic acid in treated cells. However, the increase in the SCD enzyme activity was much smaller than that expected from the increase in the SCD mRNA expression. It is interesting to note that a large increase in SCD mRNA expression observed in all-trans-retinoic acid-treated ARPE-19 cells, another human RPE cell culture system, was also not accompanied by a corresponding increase in SCD enzyme activity (16Samuel W. Kutty R.K. Nagineni S. Gordon J.S. Prouty S.M. Chandraratna R.A. Wiggert B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28744-28750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This could be because of the translational deficiency associated with certain genes in cultured RPE cells. It has been reported that these cells under certain conditions express a large amount of RPE65 mRNA with no detectable amount of RPE65 protein (41Hamel C.P. Tsilou E. Pfeffer B.A. Hooks J.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13895-13900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) that makes primary contact with the TATA element, though several TBP-associated factor (TAF) subunits comprising TFIID contribute to promoter binding (6Burke T.W.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2551-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar,10Naar A.M. Lemon B.D. Tjian R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 475-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Recruiting TFIID to the promoter, a process thought to be mediated in part by direct activator-TFIID interactions, is probably a key and universal mechanism of gene activation (9Lemon B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2551-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 10Naar A.M. Lemon B.D. Tjian R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 475-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). However, the largest subunit of metazoan TFIID, which in Drosophila (d) or humans (h) exhibits an apparent molecular mass of ∼250 kDa, termed d- or hTAFII250, respectively (herein termed d/hTAF250p), also contains a number of intrinsic enzymatic activities including histone acetyltransferase (11Mizzen C.A.

Science. 2000; 289: 2357-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Each of these activities could be targets for transactivators, and mutation of histone acetyltransferase, protein kinase, or ubiquitin activating/conjugating activity domains decreases transcription of subsets of genes in vivo(13Pham A.D.

Like its metazoan counterparts, the yeast protein, TAF130p, contains a histone acetyltransferase domain as well as a number of other essential sequences (18Bai Y. Perez G.M. Beechem J.M. Weil P.A.

One highly conserved and important element found in this (family of) TAF are domains capable of directly binding the TBP subunit of TFIID (17Reese J.C. Apone L. Walker S.S. Griffin L.A. Green M.R.

Perez G.M. Beechem J.M. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3081-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23Kokubo T. Yamashita S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Nature. 1993; 362: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar): a high affinity N-terminal TBP binding domain and a less well defined, apparently lower affinity, C-terminal TBP binding domain(s). The N-terminal domain, termed TAND (for TAFN-terminal domain), has been analyzed in detail and comprises two elements, subdomain I (amino acids (aa) 11–77 in dTAF250p, aa 10–37 in yeast TAF130p) and subdomain II (aa 82–156 dTAF250p, aa 46–71 in yeast TAF130p; Refs. 26Coleman R.A.

A. 1997; 94: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Subdomain I has been proposed to bind to the concave DNA binding surface of TBP and actively dissociate TBP from TATA DNA (23Kokubo T. Yamashita S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3520-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), whereas subdomain II is thought to interact with the convex surface of TBP and contribute to overall TAF-TBP binding affinity. Surprisingly, reconstituted TBP-TAF complexes containing d/hTAF250p exhibit reduced formation of TBP-DNA complex (8Verrijzer C.P. Chen J.L. Yokomori K. Tjian R.

Science. 1995; 270: 1783-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) relative to free TBP. The TAF130p TAND domain has been implicated in this down-regulation of DNA binding. Experiments utilizing the isolated N-terminal TAND domains derived from dTAF250p, hTAF250p, or yeast TAF130p show that this TBP binding element decreases TBP-DNA interactions at equilibrium. Consistent with these results, the NMR-derived structure of the heterologous dTAND I (aa 11–77) bound to yeast core TBP (aa 49–240) (32Liu D. Ishima R. Tong K.I. Bagby S. Kokubo T. Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. Nakatani Y. Ikura M. Cell. 1998; 94: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) shows that TAND I comprises three α-helices and a β-hairpin, unstructured when free in solution, but when complexed with TBP becomes structured and displays features mimicking the bent and splayed TATA box DNA in the TBP-TATA DNA binary complex. Clearly, occupancy of the concave surface of the TBP subunit of TFIID by TAF130p sequences would dramatically decrease the ability of TFIID to bind DNA (33Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 551-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Nonquantitative equilibrium measurements of the interaction of TBP and both dTAF230p and yeast TAF130p as monitored via gel mobility shift, DNase I footprinting, pull-downs, protein blotting, and our own quantitative time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy assays are consistent with the idea that both the yeast and metazoan TAFs decrease the binding of TBP to TATA-DNA at equilibrium (18Bai Y.

Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3520-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) that the TAND domain forms a ternary TAND-TBP-DNA complex that actively dissociates TBP from DNA. However, the mechanism by which the TAND domain operates remains to be elucidated. Moreover, the majority of studies on dTAF250p and yeast TAF130p have been performed with just the TAND fragment of the respective proteins. Clearly, modulation of TFIID-TATA DNA interactions by an integral TFIID subunit merits detailed investigation. Fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms of gene control have been derived from the elucidation of the three-dimensional structures of GTFs bound to promoter DNA. The solution of the ternary structure of TFIIA-TBP-DNA (34Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Lee S. Sigler P.B. Science. 1996; 272: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 35Tan S. Hunziker Y.

Burley S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The structure of the heterologous yeast TBP-Drosophila TAND TAF250p complex adds to this important body of information regarding mechanisms of RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex formation. However, of necessity, such structural information is static and cannot directly report the types of dynamic interactions that must occur among these molecules in living cells. For this reason we wanted to analyze both the equilibrium and kinetic aspects of the interactions between TBP, TATA-DNA, and purified full-length recombinant TAF130p using homologous components. To accomplish this goal, we used fluorescently labeled DNA as previously (18Bai Y. Perez G.M. Beechem J.M. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3081-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 40Perez-Howard G.M. Weil P.A. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8005-8017Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and also developed a fluorescent variant of TBP. Using these probes, we performed solution cuvette (41Heyduk T. Ma Y. Tang H. Ebright R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and gel mobility shift assays (42Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), two complementary methods capable of precisely performing biophysical macromolecular interaction measurements. This is the first report combining these two techniques to study TBP dynamics. We have found that full-length recombinant yeast TAF130p does not form a stable ternary complex with yeast TBP bound to TATA DNA and consequently does not actively dissociate the TBP-DNA complex; rather, full-length TAF130p binds to TBP competitively with respect to DNA. Further, we have found that full-length yeast TAF130p binds to yeast TBP with nanomolar binding affinity and that each molecule of this protein is able to bind multiple molecules of TBP. The biological consequences of these TAF130p-TBP interactions are discussed. Rhodamine X-isothiocyanate and tetramethyl rhodamine maleimide were purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). These reactive fluorophores were used to modify the genetically introduced single sulfhydryl group in TBPCys−/+ (see below) and a single reactive NH2-group in a synthetic oligonucleotide (5′-C6-aminolinker) TATA-DNA (18Bai Y. Perez G.M. Beechem J.M. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3081-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 40Perez-Howard G.M. Weil P.A. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8005-8017Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). His6-tagged wild type (WT) and the genetically modified TBPCys−/+ mutant form (see below) ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae TBP were expressed from pET15b expression plasmids in Escherichia coli strain BL21. The overexpressed proteins were purified under native conditions using chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid columns (Qiagen), followed by chromatography on Mono-S fast protein liquid chromatography cation exchange columns. Based on Sypro Orange-stained SDS-PAGE analyses coupled with scanning densitometry, the purity of these TBP preparations was determined to be >95%. His6-tagged full-length S. cerevisiae TAF130p was expressed in Hi5 insect cells (Spodoptera frugiperda) following infection with a recombinant baculovirus containing the complete TAF130p-encoding open reading frame in pACHLT-A (PharMingen). Infection of insect cells and propagation of recombinant virus was conducted according to manufacturer's instruction. TAF130p was purified via Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose chromatography, eluted with 250 mm imidazole, 7m urea followed by a slow stepwise dialysis to remove denaturant. All proteins were dialyzed into Buffer A (20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Protein concentrations were determined using two methods, amino acid analysis and measurement of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in 6 m guanidine-HCl using N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide as a standard (22Kokubo T. Takada R. Yamashita S. Gong D.W. Roeder R.G. Horikoshi M. Nakatani Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17554-17558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All solutions for fluorescence binding experiments were performed under the following standard conditions of room temperature (20–23 °C) in Binding Buffer: 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA). Where indicated competitor DNA, unlabeled 14-bp adenovirus 2 major late promoter (Ad2 MLP) DNA, was added to the binding assays. All studies were performed using a double-stranded synthetic TATA box oligonucleotide (sequence: 5′-GGCTATAAAAGGGG-3′; consensus TATA sequence in bold underlined text), the sequence was derived from the adenovirus 2 major late promoter. Rhodamine X was site-specifically incorporated at the 5′ end of the 14-mer TATA box sequence via a 5′-amino linker (5′-Amino Modifier C6, Glen Research). Labeled duplex DNA was generated and purified as detailed previously (18Bai Y. Perez G.M. Beechem J.M. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3081-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 40Perez-Howard G.M. Weil P.A. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8005-8017Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). TBPCys−/+ was constructed by oligonucleotide-mediated site-directed mutagenesis (43Poon D. Knittle R.A. Sabelko K.A. Yamamoto T. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5005-5013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two endogenous cysteine residues of S. cerevisiae TBP at positions 78 and 164 were mutated to alanine residues, and the serine residue at position 61 was then mutated to a cysteine. This triply mutated form of TBP (i.e. S61C/C78A/C164A, termed TBPCys−/+; see Fig. 1) was introduced into plasmid pDP13 (44Poon D. Schroeder S. Wang C.K. Yamamoto T. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Weil P.A.

Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This expression vector utilized the WT TBP promoter (46Schroeder S.C. Wang C.K. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28335-28346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Schroeder S.C. Weil P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4186-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) to drive normal levels of TBP expression. We used the 5-fluoroorotic acid plasmid shuffle method (48Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) to replace the normal WT allele of TBP with this triply mutated form of the gene. TBPCys−/+was site-specifically labeled using a 20-fold molar excess of tetramethyl rhodamine maleimide at 4 °C for 8 h in the dark. Unreacted fluorophore was removed by gel filtration chromatography on G-25 Sephadex columns developed with Buffer A. Pooled peak fractions were subsequently dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against two 1000-volume changes of the same buffer to ensure complete removal of free fluorophore. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with32P-labeled 40-mer Ad2 MLP TATA DNA were performed as described previously (43Poon D. Knittle R.A. Sabelko K.A. Yamamoto T. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5005-5013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding reactions (25 μl final volume) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in binding buffer, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 5% glycerol, 0.1 m NaCl, 100 μg/ml BSA, 5–10 fmol of 32P-labeled TATA DNA probe (0.4 nm final), 0–100 ng of TBP (1.2–120 nmfinal), 10 ng/μl poly(dG-dC·dG-dC), 5 mmMgCl2. DNA and TBP-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis in vertical 6% polyacrylamide gels cast, run in 1× TGM buffer (12.5 mm Tris, 95 mm glycine, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 8.3), and detected by autoradiography. The fluorescent version of these vertical EMSA assays utilized rhodamine X-labeled 14-mer TATA DNA rather than the32P-labeled 40-mer. DNA and proteins were present at the concentrations listed in the figure legends. Reactions were fractionated on 6% polyacrylamide gels cast and run in 1× TGM buffer. Gels were formed in Novex plastic gel holders and typically were electrophoresed at 400 V for 10 min at 0–4 °C. Horizontal EMSA utilized tetramethyl rhodamine (TMR)-labeled TBP. These 6% polyacrylamide gels (15 cm × 14 cm × 0.2 cm) were cast and run in 1X TGM and electrophoresed at 150 V for 90 min at 4 °C. Rh-X-labeled-DNA and TMR-labeled-TBP were visualized by use of a fluorescence scanner (Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX) by excitation with a 532-nm diode-pumped solid state laser monitoring emission using a 605-nm band pass filter (RhX) or 555-nm band pass filter (TMR). Steady-state equilibrium anisotropy measurements were performed with a T-format SPEX 1681 Fluorolog spectrofluorimeter (Edison, NJ), equipped with a 450-watt xenon arc lamp. The stopped-flow reactions were performed with an SFM-3 stopped-flow unit (Molecular Kinetics, Pullman, WA) with a 50-μl FC.15 fluorescence cuvette and hard-stop shutter. Reaction flow rates varied from 2 to 8 ml/s, and reaction time bases were typically 30 ms/channel for the association and 50 ms/channel for the dissociation reaction. Data were collected in 8192 total channels. Multiple (5Sanders S.L. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13895-13900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 6Burke T.W.

Prior to use, all solutions were extensively degassed. Stock solutions of RhX-DNA, TBP, TAF130p, and binding buffer were loaded into separate syringes for association and dissociation reactions as described under “Results.” For association and dissociation reactions, the internal controls used were free RhX-DNA and pre-bound RhX-DNA-TBP complex, respectively. These control reactions exhibited flat anisotropy values over the time course of the experiment. We previously used fluorescence anisotropy to examine the interaction of yeast TBP with DNA (40Perez-Howard G.M. Weil P.A. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8005-8017Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In these experiments we utilized fluorescence anisotropy spectroscopic binding measurements to probe both kinetic and thermodynamic features of this DNA binding reaction. The fluorophore in these experiments was either the endogenous single tryptophan of TBP (residue 26) or an extrinsic fluorophore, RhX, added to the TATA box DNA target DNA. We encountered two unrelated complications when using the single endogenous tryptophan at amino acid residue 26 in the N terminus of yeast TBP as a fluorescent reporter. The first was that, in the absence of TATA-DNA, the N terminus of TBP containing the tryptophan fluorophore behaved as if it were hydrodynamically uncoupled from the majority of the protein mass. Additionally, upon DNA binding, the hydrodynamic coupling became even less (matching that observed in 6 m guanidine HCl) and the tryptophan fluorescence emission maximum shifted by tens of nanometers, to 353 nm, identical to the unfolded protein. These results indicated that the Trp-26 fluorophore is clearly in a much different environment in the absence and presence of DNA. Second, tryptophan is inherently a very weak fluorophore and thus could only productively be utilized with TBP in the mid-micromolar concentration range. Indeed, it was this lack of sensitivity coupled with the unusual spectral properties of the tryptophan fluorophore that prompted us to develop a site-specific, extrinsically labeled TATA-DNA probe to study the protein-DNA or protein-protein interactions of this important transcription factor. Studies by others have also examined TBP and TATA-DNA interactions and generated data consistent with many of our results (49Parkhurst K.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J.

As a prelude to investigating these multiple interactions in more detail, we carried out a series of fluorescence experiments designed to study the interaction of purified, recombinant full-length TAF130p, the major TBP-binding subunit of the TFIID complex, with TBP in presence and absence of TATA-DNA. Our experiments utilized both fluorescence anisotropy and fluorescence-based native gel electrophoresis methods.

Hollinger M.A. Chemoattractant Ligands and Their Receptors. Pharmacology and Toxicology: Basic and Clinical Aspects. CRC Press, New york1996Google Scholar). For example, there are more than 30 structurally related 8- to 10-kDa proteins named chemokines (e.g.interleukin-8) that are potent immune cell chemoattractants (2Schall T.J. Bacon K.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 865-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). In addition, several arachidonic acid-derived lipids (e.g.leukotriene-B4, (3Perez H.D. Horuk R.

Sci., U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1059-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar)) are known to be potent stimulators of monocyte and neutrophil chemotaxis. These chemotactic factors have been implicated in human disease states associated with inflammation such as gastritis (5Mooney C. Keenan J. Munster D. Wilson I. Allardyce R. Bagshaw P. Chapman B.

Chemotaxis may play a role in recruitment of inflammatory cells during infection by Helicobacter pylori leading to gastritis and peptic ulcerations (11Marshall B.J. Warren J.R. Lancet. 1984; 1: 1311-1315Abstract PubMed Scopus (4283) Google Scholar). H. pylori infection is now accepted as the major cause of gastroduodenal disease (12Panel N.C.D. JAMA (J. AM. MED. ASSOC.). 1994; 272: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar) and is associated with increased risk for development of gastric carcinoma (13Parsonnet J. Friedman G.D. Vandersteen D.P.

Although the infection is widespread in the human population most infected people have no symptoms of disease, perhaps because of the genetic diversity of H. pylori strains (17Blaser M.J. BMJ. 1998; 316: 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and/or individual differences in susceptibility. Identifying the specific bacterial agents that lead to the mucosal inflammatory response is important for understanding the role ofH. pylori in gastroduodenal disease. The three possible mechanisms suggested by Crabtree (18Crabtree J.E. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 1996; 10: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) for the mucosa inflammatory response generated by H. pylori infection are: 1) a direct stimulation of monocyte and neutrophil chemotaxis to the gastric epithelial cells via factors released from the bacteria, 2) an indirect stimulation of gastric epithelial cells by H. pylori factors to release chemotactic agents, and 3) an indirect activation of immune cells by H. pylori factors to release chemotactic agents. These mechanisms are supported by evidence that this essentially non-invasive bacterium can cause neutrophil infiltration at a distance. In a gerbil model of gastritis, the initial damage caused by H. pylori infection was due to colonization of the antrum with subsequent mucosal lesions in the fundus (19Takahashi S. Keto Y. Fujita H. Muramatsu H. Nishino T. Okabe S. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1998; 43: 754-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In a rat model, bacteria-free filtrates caused delayed healing of pre-existing ulcers with active chronic inflammation (20Ross J. Bui H.X. del Rosario A. Sonbati H. George M. Lee C.Y. Amer. J. Path. 1992; 141: 721-727PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, other work shows that the bacteria are rarely found within the mucosa and mostly reside in the mucus layer overlaying the gastric epithelium (21Hazell S.L. Lee A. Brady L. Hennessy W. J. Infect. Dis. 1986; 153: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Thus the factor(s) that cause gastric inflammation presumably diffuse through the mucus and through the gastric epithelium to indirectly or directly generate the immune cell migration. These observations led others to investigate factors produced byH. pylori that cause monocyte and neutrophil chemotaxis (19Takahashi S. Keto Y. Fujita H. Muramatsu H. Nishino T. Okabe S. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1998; 43: 754-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,22Fukuda T. Kimura S. Arakawa T. Kobayashi K. J. Clin.

Helicobacter pylori: Basic Mechanisms to Clinical Cure. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1994: 198-206Crossref Google Scholar). In this work the low molecular weight chemotactic factor from H. pylori supernatants has been identified as diethyl phthalate (DEP). The H. pylori strain ATCC 43579 (American Tissue Cell Culture) was grown under microaerophilic conditions at 37 °C in brucella broth (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) with 1% heat-inactivated PBS, 10 μg/ml vancomycin (Sigma), and 2.5 units/ml polymyxin B (Sigma) for 48 to 72 h. The bacteria were harvested during log growth phase. The resultant cultures were centrifuged at 3000 rpm, and the pellet washed twice with calcium- and magnesium-free PBS. The final pellet was then re-suspended with PBS, which was prescreened for chemotactic activity, to give an absorbance value of 0.9 units at 620 nm (∼107colony-forming units/ml). The re-suspended H. pylori were incubated in PBS for 4 h at 37 °C and harvested again by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 30 min at 25 °C. The supernatant was then filtered through a 0.22-mm filter and either used immediately or stored at −80 °C. Frozen supernatants could be thawed and show chemotactic activity for up to two months after collection. Monocytes were isolated from the peripheral venous blood of healthy donors on a Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient (Histopaques, Sigma). The cells were washed and re-suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium Low Glucose (Invitrogen) containing 0.1% heat-inactivated PBS. Cells were confirmed as monocytes by microscopy using Wright stain and counted using a hemocytometer. The monocyte concentration was diluted to a final concentration of 106 cells/ml. The chemotaxis of monocytes in response to H. pylorisupernatant fractions was assayed using 48-well chemotactic chambers (Neuro-Probe, Inc., Cabin John, MD) (32Falk W. Goodwin R.H. Leonard E.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 33: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The upper chamber was separated from the lower compartment by a polyvinyl propylene-free nitrocellulose filter with a 5 μm pore size (Costar, Pleasanton, CA). The upper compartment of the chemotactic chamber was loaded with 50 μl of the monocyte cell suspension. The lower compartment was filled with 27 μl of aliquots of serial dilutions of the sample to be tested. Control wells containing 10−8m fMLP (positive control) or PBS (negative control) were run in each assay. Following an incubation period of 1.5 h at 37 °C, the filters were stained with Giesma stain, and the number of monocytes that had migrated to the lower surface of the filter was counted microscopically and tallied as the mean of 20 random high-power fields for each well. Each assay was done at least three times. The cell counts were expressed as the mean number of monocytes per high-powered field. The chemokinesis activity (or cell movement unrelated to a concentration gradient) was distinguished from chemotactic activity (directed cell movement) by checkerboard analysis. The checkerboard analysis consists of serial dilutions of the test sample placed in the lower compartment of the chamber and the same serial dilutions of the monocytes in the upper compartment. Directional movement of the cells in response to a concentration gradient was graded as chemotactic activity, whereas increased movement of cells unrelated to the concentration gradient was defined as chemokinesis. Conditioned supernatants with chemotactic activity were concentrated by solid phase chromatography on SepPakTM cartridges (Waters-Millipore, Milford, MA). Five “classic” cartridges containing 360 mg of C-18 packing material were connected in series. The cartridges were pre-rinsed with 50 ml of ethanol followed by 50 ml of an aqueous 0.1% acetic acid solution. One liter of conditioned supernatant was loaded onto this series of pre-rinsed cartridges at 5 ml/min., the series was rinsed with 50 ml of 0.1% acetic acid solution and eluted sequentially with 10 ml of 30% and 10 ml of 70% ethanol. The 30 and 70% ethanol eluants were pooled separately, diluted with PBS, and tested for chemotactic activity. The active fraction from the 70% ethanol eluant was diluted 5-fold with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid then loaded onto a reverse phase HPLC column (Vydac C-18 reverse phase HPLC column, 4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μ, catalog number 218TP54, Separation Group, Hesperia, CA) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Samples were loaded in 4-ml increments through a 5-ml sample injector. The column was rinsed for 5 min. with this 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, then eluted with a rapid (10 min) gradient to 25% acetonitrile and a slow gradient (60 min) to 40% acetonitrile. The effluent was monitored at 220 and 280 nm, and fractions were collected manually. A portion (5–10%) of each fraction was diluted 5-fold with 0.1% acetic acid, loaded onto a single SepPakTM cartridge that was pre-rinsed with 10 ml of ethanol, followed by 10 ml of 0.1% acetic acid. After loading the cartridge was rinsed with 0.1% acetic acid and eluted with 1.5 ml of 70% ethanol containing 0.1% acetic acid. HPLC column controls containing 35% acetonitrile were diluted, loaded, and eluted in the same manner and were shown to have no chemotactic activity. The water/acetic acid/ethanol buffer caused no interference in the chemotactic assay. To measure the 1H-NMR signals of the chemotactic factor eluted in a protonated water/ethanol/acetic acid solvent system it was necessary to exchange this solution for one containing deuterated solvents. The buffer exchange was accomplished using a micro-capillary HPLC system designed and built at the Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope. In brief, an ISCO100DM syringe pump was used to deliver a 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid solution under constant pressure control to displace a preformed reverse phase gradient from a six port switching valve (Rheodyne Model 7000, Cotati, CA) directly onto a 5-cm × 0.5-mm fused silica micro-column constructed and packed as previously described (33Davis M.T. Lee T.D. Protein Sci. 1992; 3: 935-944Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The sample injector (Rheodyne Model 7125) was placed upstream relative to the gradient valve to minimize the dead volume between the gradient loop and column. The deuterated organic gradient was produced off-line using two Harvard Apparatus Model 44 programmable syringe pumps and a reduced volume tee connector for mixing and storing the gradient in a loop. The gradient loop was back-filled in reverse order to place the start of the gradient at the front of the loop. The gradient was formed while the sample was being loaded onto the column and was switched on-line following the completion of the loading step. The micro-column effluent was monitored at 200 nm using an ABI model 757 UV visible absorption spectrometry detector equipped with a capillary flow-cell holder. The detector output was recorded on a Soltec model 1241 strip-chart recorder. A steep linear gradient from 5 to 95% buffer B (Buffer A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in D2O; Buffer B, deuterated acetonitrile-CD3CN) over 5 min at a flow-rate of 20 μl/min was used to elute the chemotactic activity. Fractions containing the 200 nm of absorbing material were collected manually into polypropylene tubes. The collected fractions were pooled and extracted into CD2Cl2 from the aqueous solution containing trifluoroacetic acid and CD3CN. The trifluoroacetic acid remained in the aqueous phase while the chemotactic factor and CD3CN were extracted into the methylene chloride solvent. The NMR experiments on the purified chemotactic agent were performed on a Varian Unity Plus NMR spectrometer with a 500 MHz1H frequency, and the probe air temperature regulated at 25 °C. A 700-μl aliquot of the pooled, CD2Cl2 extracted sample described above was placed in an NMR tube and sealed with ParafilmTM. Typical NMR parameters were: an acquisition time of 1.5 s, a 6000-Hz spectral width, 128–256 transients co-added with a 10-s delay between each transient, a pre-saturation delay of 1 s at the frequency of the H2O signal (2.5 ppm), and the transmitter channel used for both acquisition and decoupling. Synthetic DEP was used as received with a 5-μl of (5.6 mg) aliquot diluted in 1 gram of CD2Cl2 (∼25 mm DEP), and this sampled sealed in an NMR tube. This solution was also used to spike the NMR sample derived from the H. pylori supernatant to demonstrate signal superposition. Two different GC/MS instruments were used. HPLC fractions containing the purified chemotactic agent were dried in a stream of nitrogen and re-dissolved in 10 μl of ethyl acetate, and 1–3 μl of aliquots were loaded onto a solvent-free GC injector (dropping needle type, Ray Allen Assoc., Boulder, CO) connected to a bonded phase fused silica capillary column (DB-1HT, 15 m, 0.26 mm inner diameter, film thickness 0.25 microns, J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA) using helium as the carrier gas. The end of the column was inserted directly into the ion source of a modified HP 5985B GC/MS instrument. A head pressure of 1.5 p.s.i. of helium was maintained in the GC injector port. The injector port and transfer line were maintained at 250 °C. The GC oven was held at 80 °C for 1 min following injection and then increased linearly at 10 °C/min to a plateau of 300 °C. The mass spectrometer was operated in the electron ionization mode with a high-energy dynode detector (Phrasor Scientific, Duarte, CA) set at −5 kV. The MS ion source was held at 200 °C, and an ion current of 300 microamps (70 electron volts) was used. Solutions of authentic standards including methyl stearate, benzophenone, and DEP were analyzed under identical conditions. SepPakTM-purified samples from control experiments designed to test the possibility that DEHP was converted to DEP during sample preparation were concentrated in stream of dry nitrogen, then redissolved in dichloromethane, and injected with a Groβ-type splitless injector onto a bonded phase fused silica capillary column (DB-5MS, 30 m, 0.25 mm inner diameter, film thickness 0.25 microns, J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA) using helium as the carrier gas. The end of the column was inserted directly into the ion source of a Finnigan 4000 GC/MS instrument. A head pressure of 11 p.s.i. of helium was maintained in the GC injector port. The injector port and transfer line were maintained at 280 °C. The GC oven was held at 30 °C for 4 min following injection and then increased linearly at 6 °C/min to a plateau of 300 °C. The mass spectrometer was operated in the electron ionization mode. The MS ion source was held at 240 °C, and an ion current of 500 microamps (70 electron volts) was used. Preliminary results showed that synthetic DEP and purified chemotactic factor eluted at 31.9 and 31.4 min, respectively, during elution on a C-18 reverse phase column. Equal peak areas of absorbance at 220 nm of DEP (25 μl of neat DEP diluted 1,000-fold in ethanol and then 10-fold in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and the purified chemotactic factor (25 μl from final purification step) were co-injected and eluted under the same conditions to determine whether they eluted as a single peak. Phthalate esters are used as plasticizers in the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride. All manufacturers of plasticware and filters used in this study were contacted, and they stated that no phthalates were used in the manufacture of their plasticware. However, it was felt that it was important to verify that the purified chemotactic agent actually came from bacteria and not from outside sources. To verify that the source of the chemotactic agent was not from the plasticware the same series of procedures were performed on the media without bacteria present, including: incubation of the brucella broth, the SepPakTM concentration step, solution volumes, times of incubations, and the type of glassware and plasticware used (these experiments were performed in parallel with the experiments on media containing bacteria). The concentrates from cultures with and without bacteria were examined by reverse phase chromatography (see Fig. 6legend) for the presence of the chemotactic agent. The absorbance at 220 and 280 nm were monitored, and fractions were collected and assayed for chemotactic activity. As an additional control, a solution of synthetic di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP, 0.1 mg/2 ml) was loaded on the SepPakTM column and eluted with ethanol as described above. This solution was diluted and tested for chemotactic activity. Monocytes migrated toward concentrated supernatants from H. pylori incubated for 1.5 h in physiological saline (Fig. 1) in a dose-dependent manner. The peak chemotactic activity from the purified supernatant was ∼70% the value observed for a 10−8m solution of fMLP (positive control) (Fig. 2). During the purification of chemotactic agent it was determined that acetonitrile/trifluoroacetate HPLC buffers interfered in the chemotactic assay. Therefore, a buffer exchange was developed with a 0.05–0.1-ml aliquot of the HPLC fractions that exchanged the HPLC buffer for an acetic acid/ethanol buffer on a SepPakTM cartridge before the chemotactic assay. The acetic acid/ethanol buffer caused no interference in the chemotactic assay.Figure 2Final HPLC of chemotactic activity purified from H. pylori supernatants.A, the solid line shows the absorbance at 220 nm, and the bars show the fractions whose chemotactic activity is shown in B.

This was concentrated by SepPakTM solid phase chromatography. A partial purification was achieved by first eluting the SepPakTM with 30% ethanol (this contained no chemotactic activity) followed by another elution with 70% ethanol. The 70% ethanol eluant was diluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetate loaded on a C-18 reverse phase HPLC column and eluted with an increasing gradient of acetonitrile. The active fractions from two separate purifications were pooled, diluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetate loaded onto the same column and eluted in the same manner as the first HPLC step. One major absorbance peak eluted (Fig. 2A) with absorbance at 220 nm and 280 nm (profile for 280 nm not shown). This peak contained chemotactic activity while adjoining fractions did not (Fig.2B). A micro-scale solvent exchange system was used to prepare the NMR samples because the intensity of CH3CN signal in the un-modified sample obscured the much smaller signals present from the purified chemotactic agent. The HPLC-purified sample described above was subjected to a micro-column HPLC procedure to replace the protonated acetonitrile with deuterated acetonitrile. A greatly reduced signal from protonated CH3CN (at 1.94 ppm) resulted from this procedure. The chemical shifts and integrated areas of the NMR signals are consistent with DEP. The three major signals aside from solvent peaks were found centered at 7.571, 4.234 (quartet), and, 1.250 (triplet) ppm (shown in the expanded sections of Fig. 3). The relative ratio of integrals for these signals is 2:2:3, respectively. The symmetric set of aromatic signals at 7.63 and 7.52 ppm are consistent with an R,R′ortho-substituted aromatic ring. The signals at 4.234 and 1.250 are spin-coupled to each other and have the chemical shift appropriate for an aromatic bound ethoxy group. The signal at 1.2 ppm is apparently from an impurity. Signals from residual protonated methylene chloride, acetonitrile and water were present in the NMR spectrum. The signals from the protonated acetonitrile were reduced by solvent exchange, and the CH2Cl2 signal were small enough so that they did not interfere with signals from the purified chemotactic factor. In addition, the signal from the water remaining after the methylene chloride extraction was reduced by presaturation. The other smaller signals observed between 0.8 and 4.0 ppm are not part of DEP because of their smaller intensities relative to DEP signals and because any other substitution pattern of the benzene ring would greatly alter the coupling patterns of the molecule. The NMR spectra acquired with synthetic DEP shows that the purified chemotactic agent is diethyl phthalate. The same pattern of signals with the same relative areas is observed for synthetic DEP as seen in Fig. 3 (data not shown). The chemical shifts of synthetic DEP in 99.99% CD2Cl2 (7.628, 4.328, and 1.347 ppm for aromatic, methylene, and methyl signals) are slightly altered from those observed in the sample derived from the bacteria. These small changes are likely due to the presence of acetonitrile in the purified sample from H. pylori supernatant. This was confirmed by spiking the purified sample with synthetic DEP and the observation of increases in the intensities of only signals assigned to DEP. Aliquots of the HPLC-purified chemotactic factor and synthetic DEP were analyzed by combined gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The purified chemotactic factor and synthetic DEP had indistinguishable GC retention times (6.02 and 6.04 min, respectively). Under electron ionization conditions the purified chemotactic factor gave three main ions atm/z 222, 177, and 149. Synthetic DEP had the same ion series with the same relative intensities as the purified compound (Fig. 4). The signal atm/z 222 corresponds to the molecular ion for DEP (M+⋅), and the 177 and 149 signals are assigned to loss of a pendant ethoxy group and loss of ethoxy and ethane groups, respectively, from the parent compound. The GC/MS data confirm the NMR assignment of the chemotactic factor as diethyl phthalate. Reverse phase gradient HPLC chromatographs were obtained of the purified chemotactic agent, synthetic DEP, and the two combined to test if the synthetic DEP and the purified chemotactic agent had similar elution profiles. Purified and synthetic diethyl phthalate elute in the same position when injected separately (31.4 and 31.9 min, respectively) and as a single peak when co-injected (shown in Fig. 5).

Poch O. Tordo N. Moras D. Argos P. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). This prototype pol I is a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase with a modular structure and contains both polymerase and nuclease activities in a single polypeptide chain. Our interest in TB pol I stems from the parent organism, M. tuberculosis, the etiologic agent of tuberculosis. This disease kills more people around the world each year than any other infectious disease.

Toward this ultimate goal, we have begun to investigate functional similarities of this polymerase with those of the prototype, E. coli pol I. We have purified both the 100-kDa holoenzyme (containing 5′-3′ exonuclease, 3′-5′ exonuclease, and 3′- 5′ polymerase domains) and its 63-kDa fragment equivalent to Klenow fragment of E. coli pol I and have compared their catalytic properties. A number of similarities in these properties have been noted as expected from ∼60% sequence homology (in polymerase domain) between the two species. 2C. J. Arrigo, K. Singh, N. Kaushik, and M. J. Modak, manuscript in preparation. 2C. J. Arrigo, K. Singh, N. Kaushik, and M. J. Modak, manuscript in preparation. We were particularly interested in the substrate-binding domain of TB pol I for it is perceived as an excellent target for the development of inhibitors. The primary amino acid sequence comparison (Fig. 1) shows the conservation of catalytically important amino acids in many members of the pol I family suggesting conserved catalytic mechanism. Thus, the commonality of reaction mechanism and possible structural similarity of the catalytic segment of TB pol I with the prototype, E. coli pol I is expected to permit the translation of new findings from one polymerase to other members of this family.The crystal structures of several pol I family members in apo and binary (dNTP or template/primer bound) complexes show a highly conserved aspartate (732 of E. coli pol I) present in the three-residue long hinge region between the M and N helices of pol I (5Korolev S.

This aspartate appears to form a salt bridge with Arg-754 (E. coli pol I position) of the O-helix. These structural observations suggest that the conserved aspartate in the hinge between M and N helices stabilizes the position of arginine in the O-helix and should complement the function of Arg-754 in pol I and its equivalent in KlenTaq (Arg-659). To clarify the functional role of this conserved aspartate, we introduced conserved and nonconserved mutations within the M to N helical hinge of TB pol I to generate D707A, D707E, and E706A enzyme species.Since, in the ternary complex of KlenTaq, Asp-637 (equivalent to Asp-707 of TB pol I) also forms an H-bond with Gln-613 (TB Gln-683 orE. coli Gln-708 equivalent), we generated the Q683A mutant and characterized its biochemical properties. In addition, a double mutant, Q683N/D707E was constructed with the expectation that a putative defect in Q683N may be compensated for by increased side chain length in D707E. The results presented in this article suggest that the conserved Asp-707 is essential for catalytic function and that its properties are very similar to those reported for Arg-754 (10Astatke M. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1945-1954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 11Kaushik N. Pandey V.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7256-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this aspartate as well as the equivalent aspartate inE. coli pol I appears to be required for the substrate binding and ternary complex formation, the latter requiring the motion of the O-helix.DISCUSSIONThe sequence alignment of family A polymerase (including pol I) members and the examination of the available crystal structures of pol I from different organisms reveals the presence of a highly conserved aspartate within the GXD sequence located on the hinge region between M and N helices (Fig. 1). In addition, the adjoining region constituted by the “O-helix” in the prototype E. coli pol I also appears to be highly conserved among all the members of this family including TB pol I (Fig. 1). The available crystal structures of pol I family members, KF (6Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), KlenTaq (9Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), and T7 DNA polymerase (22Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar), show that the connector function of this three-residue region is common and that the position of the hinge region is in the close physical vicinity of the O-helix of the “fingers” subdomain. In the GXD region, both glycine and aspartate represent conserved residues. Since glycine residues generally do not participate in the reaction but rather provide local structural integrity, we chose not to investigate the role of this glycine. To understand the function of the aspartate in the GXD sequence of TB pol I, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis at Asp-707. Since Asp-707 is preceded by another carboxylate (Glu-706) and in other members of this family, Asp-707 equivalent aspartate interacts with conserved Gln, we also included Glu-706 and Gln-683 of TB pol I in the present studies. The functional significance of these residues was deduced by the examination of properties of mutant enzymes such as DNA polymerase activity, kinetics of nucleotide incorporation, dNTP and DNA binding affinity, ternary complex formation, processivity, and fidelity.The catalytic activity of the mutant TB polymerases showed that substitution of Asp-707 to Ala or Glu resulted in a significant decrease in DNA polymerase activity suggesting an important role for this residue in some catalytic function of pol I. However, no significant effect on the catalytic activity was apparent when its neighbor, Glu-706 was converted to Ala-706. Similarly, Gln-683 did not appear to be essential for the activity. Nevertheless, a double mutant D707E/Q683N was severely defective in catalytic function, probably representing the effect of D707E (see Table II). Very similar results were obtained for KF protein when its Asp-732 (equivalent of Asp-707 of TB pol I) was mutated to Ala-732. Therefore, Asp-707 of TB pol I is concluded to have a major role in the catalytic function in a manner similar to the equivalent aspartate present in the hinge region of M and N helices in other pol I family members. The kinetic analysis of D707A and other mutants clearly suggested that one of the defects with D707A, D707E, and D707E/Q673N is the decrease in the affinity for the dNTP substrate as judged by 10–30-fold increase in theKm(dNTP) (Table III) and loss of their ability to cross-link to substrate dNTP (Fig. 2). Most interestingly, the catalytic activity of these mutants was little affected when Mn2+ was substituted in place of Mg2+ as the divalent cation (Table II). These properties are reminiscent of those of O-helix muteins from E. coli pol I, namely Y766A, F762A, and R754A (10, 11). Further examination of Asp-707 muteins also showed the severe loss of pyrophosphorolysis activity (Fig. 3) and significant increase in the apparentKm(PPi), suggesting defect in the binding of PPi. The loss of binding affinity for substrate dNTP as well as for the product PPi by D707A is suggestive of the participation of Asp-707 in both of these functions. However, no change in the processivity of DNA synthesis or change in the sensitivity to dideoxynucleotides (Fig. 5) was observed with Asp-707 muteins. In addition, D707A seems to exhibit better fidelity properties compared with wild type (Fig. 4). Nevertheless, the persistent loss of catalytic activity for Asp-707 muteins, even in the presence of saturating concentrations of both template/primer and dNTP, was somewhat puzzling. We therefore, determined if the Asp-707 (Asp-732 of KF) muteins, were capable of forming a stable ternary complex. As described under “Results,” D707A of TB pol I and its E. coli counterpart D732A were unable to form stable ternary complexes (Fig. 6), even in the presence of high concentrations of substrate dNTP. Thus Asp-707 in the hinge region is concluded to be an essential component for the motion of finger subdomain (mainly O-helix) which is implicated in the ternary complex formation.From the above discussion, it is clear that most of the properties displayed by Asp-707 mutein of TB pol I are common to D732A of E. coli pol I (KF). Therefore, it seems likely that the process of dNTP binding and the ternary complex formation via the motion of the O-helix region is similar in both TB pol I and E. coli pol I. Unfortunately, the structure of TB pol I has not yet been resolved preventing us from drawing firm conclusions regarding a contribution of the hinge region aspartate in the catalytic process. However, structures of KF as well as KlenTaq have been firmly established and this has permitted us to draw valid conclusions for the role of Asp-732 in the catalytic process of pol I. Conserved D in the hinge region of M to N helices in pol I has Arg-754 of the O-helix as a major interacting partner. In the apo, DNA/dNTP-bound binary and DNA-dNTP-bound ternary complexes, a salt bridge between these two residues is consistently observed. Since the properties of muteins of either Asp-732 or Arg-754 of pol I are quite similar, we are tempted to suggest that the loss of the salt bridge between the Asp of the hinge and the Arg of the O-helix may be the major factor affecting catalytic function. Another interesting observation pertains to ∼3-fold decrease in the binding affinity for template/primer by Asp-732 muteins. This observation is suggestive of some role for Asp-732 in the binding/stabilization of template/primer. One possible scenario by which Asp-707 may indirectly participate in the process is as follows. Examination of the ternary complex structure of KlenTaq (9Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) shows that its Asp-637 (equivalent to Asp-707 of TB pol I and Asp-732 of pol I) interacts with His-639 (equivalent to His-709 of TB pol I and His-734 of pol I). This histidine in pol I has been suggested to participate in the binding/stabilization of single-stranded template (10Astatke M. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1945-1954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We have noted that a major factor in the stabilization of template/primer to DNA polymerases of this family is the single-stranded template overhang (to be published elsewhere). 3R. Gangurde and M. J. Modak, manuscript in preparation. Thus Asp-732 by means of its van der Waals interaction with the β carbon of His-709, may indirectly contribute to the template/primer binding process in pol I family of polymerases.Most interestingly, the loss in the ability of mutein of pol I Asp-732 to form the closed ternary complex (Fig. 6) may be further examined by comparing the position of the O-helix in the binary (E·TP) and ternary (E·TP·dNTP) complexes (Fig.7). As Arg-754 of the O-helix is seen to form the salt bridge with Asp-732 of the hinge in all complexes, what follows is the implication that the “salt bridge” structure is a responsible factor for the motion of the O-helix. Indeed this will also explain slight repositioning of the M and N helices (due to a pull exerted in the hinge region) that can be seen in the ternary complexes.Figure 7Position of O-helix in the apo and ternary complex structures of KlenTaq. This figure shows the rotation of O-helix (rendered as a ribbon) upon the formation of the closed ternary complex (PDB numbers: 1KTQ and 3 KTQ). The Cα positions of Arg-754, Lys-758, Phe-762, and Tyr-766 in both forms are shown as spheres. The ddNTP in the ternary complex is represented in the ball and stick. As seen in the crystal structures, the position of O-helix is rotated ∼41 Å toward the cleft upon the ternary complex formation as shown by thearrow in the figure. This rotation of O-helix displaces the Cα positions of Arg-754 and Lys-758 by 9 and 5.4 Å, respectively. The side chains of four critical residues of O-helix (Arg-754, Lys-758, Phe-762, and Tyr-766) in the ternary complex are displayed insticks. The Arg-754 side chain in this figure is behind the ribbon represented O-helix. The displacement in the position of Asp-732, before and after ternary complex formation, is also shown by abroken arrow.

Little change is observed in the positions of Phe-762 and Tyr-766. It is therefore possible, that failure to form the ternary complex may also fail to bring Lys-758 close to the active site to interact with the α-phosphate of incoming dNTP, resulting in the catalytically inactive enzyme.In summary, the properties of conserved aspartate of TB pol I corresponding to the joining region of M and N helices, suggest that it is required for dNTP binding, pyrophosphorolysis as well as ternary complex formation. Many analogous properties observed with equivalent aspartate in E. coli pol I have permitted the elucidation of a tentative structural mechanism by which this aspartate may contribute to the process of catalysis in pol I family of enzymes.

Since, in the ternary complex of KlenTaq, Asp-637 (equivalent to Asp-707 of TB pol I) also forms an H-bond with Gln-613 (TB Gln-683 orE. coli Gln-708 equivalent), we generated the Q683A mutant and characterized its biochemical properties. In addition, a double mutant, Q683N/D707E was constructed with the expectation that a putative defect in Q683N may be compensated for by increased side chain length in D707E. The results presented in this article suggest that the conserved Asp-707 is essential for catalytic function and that its properties are very similar to those reported for Arg-754 (10Astatke M.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7256-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this aspartate as well as the equivalent aspartate inE. coli pol I appears to be required for the substrate binding and ternary complex formation, the latter requiring the motion of the O-helix. DISCUSSIONThe sequence alignment of family A polymerase (including pol I) members and the examination of the available crystal structures of pol I from different organisms reveals the presence of a highly conserved aspartate within the GXD sequence located on the hinge region between M and N helices (Fig. 1). In addition, the adjoining region constituted by the “O-helix” in the prototype E. coli pol I also appears to be highly conserved among all the members of this family including TB pol I (Fig. 1). The available crystal structures of pol I family members, KF (6Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), KlenTaq (9Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), and T7 DNA polymerase (22Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar), show that the connector function of this three-residue region is common and that the position of the hinge region is in the close physical vicinity of the O-helix of the “fingers” subdomain. In the GXD region, both glycine and aspartate represent conserved residues. Since glycine residues generally do not participate in the reaction but rather provide local structural integrity, we chose not to investigate the role of this glycine. To understand the function of the aspartate in the GXD sequence of TB pol I, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis at Asp-707. Since Asp-707 is preceded by another carboxylate (Glu-706) and in other members of this family, Asp-707 equivalent aspartate interacts with conserved Gln, we also included Glu-706 and Gln-683 of TB pol I in the present studies. The functional significance of these residues was deduced by the examination of properties of mutant enzymes such as DNA polymerase activity, kinetics of nucleotide incorporation, dNTP and DNA binding affinity, ternary complex formation, processivity, and fidelity.The catalytic activity of the mutant TB polymerases showed that substitution of Asp-707 to Ala or Glu resulted in a significant decrease in DNA polymerase activity suggesting an important role for this residue in some catalytic function of pol I. However, no significant effect on the catalytic activity was apparent when its neighbor, Glu-706 was converted to Ala-706. Similarly, Gln-683 did not appear to be essential for the activity. Nevertheless, a double mutant D707E/Q683N was severely defective in catalytic function, probably representing the effect of D707E (see Table II). Very similar results were obtained for KF protein when its Asp-732 (equivalent of Asp-707 of TB pol I) was mutated to Ala-732. Therefore, Asp-707 of TB pol I is concluded to have a major role in the catalytic function in a manner similar to the equivalent aspartate present in the hinge region of M and N helices in other pol I family members. The kinetic analysis of D707A and other mutants clearly suggested that one of the defects with D707A, D707E, and D707E/Q673N is the decrease in the affinity for the dNTP substrate as judged by 10–30-fold increase in theKm(dNTP) (Table III) and loss of their ability to cross-link to substrate dNTP (Fig. 2). Most interestingly, the catalytic activity of these mutants was little affected when Mn2+ was substituted in place of Mg2+ as the divalent cation (Table II). These properties are reminiscent of those of O-helix muteins from E. coli pol I, namely Y766A, F762A, and R754A (10, 11). Further examination of Asp-707 muteins also showed the severe loss of pyrophosphorolysis activity (Fig. 3) and significant increase in the apparentKm(PPi), suggesting defect in the binding of PPi. The loss of binding affinity for substrate dNTP as well as for the product PPi by D707A is suggestive of the participation of Asp-707 in both of these functions. However, no change in the processivity of DNA synthesis or change in the sensitivity to dideoxynucleotides (Fig. 5) was observed with Asp-707 muteins. In addition, D707A seems to exhibit better fidelity properties compared with wild type (Fig. 4). Nevertheless, the persistent loss of catalytic activity for Asp-707 muteins, even in the presence of saturating concentrations of both template/primer and dNTP, was somewhat puzzling. We therefore, determined if the Asp-707 (Asp-732 of KF) muteins, were capable of forming a stable ternary complex. As described under “Results,” D707A of TB pol I and its E. coli counterpart D732A were unable to form stable ternary complexes (Fig. 6), even in the presence of high concentrations of substrate dNTP. Thus Asp-707 in the hinge region is concluded to be an essential component for the motion of finger subdomain (mainly O-helix) which is implicated in the ternary complex formation.From the above discussion, it is clear that most of the properties displayed by Asp-707 mutein of TB pol I are common to D732A of E. coli pol I (KF). Therefore, it seems likely that the process of dNTP binding and the ternary complex formation via the motion of the O-helix region is similar in both TB pol I and E. coli pol I. Unfortunately, the structure of TB pol I has not yet been resolved preventing us from drawing firm conclusions regarding a contribution of the hinge region aspartate in the catalytic process. However, structures of KF as well as KlenTaq have been firmly established and this has permitted us to draw valid conclusions for the role of Asp-732 in the catalytic process of pol I. Conserved D in the hinge region of M to N helices in pol I has Arg-754 of the O-helix as a major interacting partner. In the apo, DNA/dNTP-bound binary and DNA-dNTP-bound ternary complexes, a salt bridge between these two residues is consistently observed. Since the properties of muteins of either Asp-732 or Arg-754 of pol I are quite similar, we are tempted to suggest that the loss of the salt bridge between the Asp of the hinge and the Arg of the O-helix may be the major factor affecting catalytic function. Another interesting observation pertains to ∼3-fold decrease in the binding affinity for template/primer by Asp-732 muteins. This observation is suggestive of some role for Asp-732 in the binding/stabilization of template/primer. One possible scenario by which Asp-707 may indirectly participate in the process is as follows. Examination of the ternary complex structure of KlenTaq (9Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) shows that its Asp-637 (equivalent to Asp-707 of TB pol I and Asp-732 of pol I) interacts with His-639 (equivalent to His-709 of TB pol I and His-734 of pol I). This histidine in pol I has been suggested to participate in the binding/stabilization of single-stranded template (10Astatke M. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1945-1954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We have noted that a major factor in the stabilization of template/primer to DNA polymerases of this family is the single-stranded template overhang (to be published elsewhere). 3R. Gangurde and M. J. Modak, manuscript in preparation. Thus Asp-732 by means of its van der Waals interaction with the β carbon of His-709, may indirectly contribute to the template/primer binding process in pol I family of polymerases.Most interestingly, the loss in the ability of mutein of pol I Asp-732 to form the closed ternary complex (Fig. 6) may be further examined by comparing the position of the O-helix in the binary (E·TP) and ternary (E·TP·dNTP) complexes (Fig.7). As Arg-754 of the O-helix is seen to form the salt bridge with Asp-732 of the hinge in all complexes, what follows is the implication that the “salt bridge” structure is a responsible factor for the motion of the O-helix. Indeed this will also explain slight repositioning of the M and N helices (due to a pull exerted in the hinge region) that can be seen in the ternary complexes.Examination of the O-helix motion seen in the crystal structures of KlenTaq, as depicted in Fig. 7, also indicates that the maximal motion (∼9.4 Å) occurs at Arg-754, while the catalytically important Lys-758 moves by about 5.8 Å. Little change is observed in the positions of Phe-762 and Tyr-766. It is therefore possible, that failure to form the ternary complex may also fail to bring Lys-758 close to the active site to interact with the α-phosphate of incoming dNTP, resulting in the catalytically inactive enzyme.In summary, the properties of conserved aspartate of TB pol I corresponding to the joining region of M and N helices, suggest that it is required for dNTP binding, pyrophosphorolysis as well as ternary complex formation. Many analogous properties observed with equivalent aspartate in E. coli pol I have permitted the elucidation of a tentative structural mechanism by which this aspartate may contribute to the process of catalysis in pol I family of enzymes. The sequence alignment of family A polymerase (including pol I) members and the examination of the available crystal structures of pol I from different organisms reveals the presence of a highly conserved aspartate within the GXD sequence located on the hinge region between M and N helices (Fig. 1). In addition, the adjoining region constituted by the “O-helix” in the prototype E. coli pol I also appears to be highly conserved among all the members of this family including TB pol I (Fig. 1). The available crystal structures of pol I family members, KF (6Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), KlenTaq (9Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), and T7 DNA polymerase (22Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar), show that the connector function of this three-residue region is common and that the position of the hinge region is in the close physical vicinity of the O-helix of the “fingers” subdomain. In the GXD region, both glycine and aspartate represent conserved residues. Since glycine residues generally do not participate in the reaction but rather provide local structural integrity, we chose not to investigate the role of this glycine.

The catalytic activity of the mutant TB polymerases showed that substitution of Asp-707 to Ala or Glu resulted in a significant decrease in DNA polymerase activity suggesting an important role for this residue in some catalytic function of pol I. However, no significant effect on the catalytic activity was apparent when its neighbor, Glu-706 was converted to Ala-706. Similarly, Gln-683 did not appear to be essential for the activity. Nevertheless, a double mutant D707E/Q683N was severely defective in catalytic function, probably representing the effect of D707E (see Table II). Very similar results were obtained for KF protein when its Asp-732 (equivalent of Asp-707 of TB pol I) was mutated to Ala-732. Therefore, Asp-707 of TB pol I is concluded to have a major role in the catalytic function in a manner similar to the equivalent aspartate present in the hinge region of M and N helices in other pol I family members. The kinetic analysis of D707A and other mutants clearly suggested that one of the defects with D707A, D707E, and D707E/Q673N is the decrease in the affinity for the dNTP substrate as judged by 10–30-fold increase in theKm(dNTP) (Table III) and loss of their ability to cross-link to substrate dNTP (Fig. 2).

The loss of binding affinity for substrate dNTP as well as for the product PPi by D707A is suggestive of the participation of Asp-707 in both of these functions. However, no change in the processivity of DNA synthesis or change in the sensitivity to dideoxynucleotides (Fig. 5) was observed with Asp-707 muteins. In addition, D707A seems to exhibit better fidelity properties compared with wild type (Fig. 4).

We investigated water-transfer reactions during the activation process to explore the possibility that functional interaction between antithrombin and sulfated glycosaminoglycans can be regulated by osmotic potentials.

Osmotic stress was induced with chemically inert probes that are geometrically excluded from the water-permeable spaces of antithrombin and from intermolecular spaces formed during the association reaction. The free energy change, ΔG, for the antithrombin/heparin interaction was calculated from the dissociation constant, determined by functional titrations of heparin with antithrombin at fixed concentrations of the coagulation protease factor Xa. The effect of osmotic stress was independent of the chemical nature of osmotic probes but correlated with their radius up to radius >17 Å. In mixtures including a large and a small probe, the effect of the large probe was not modified by the small probe added at a large molar excess.

Stereospecific requirements for maximal inhibitory activity have been ascribed to a pentasaccharide sequence containing four sulfate groups on glucosamine residues and two carboxylates on uronic acid residues (9Rosenberg R.D.

Commercial preparations of heparin used routinely as anticoagulants are enriched with these highly charged sequences as compared with heparan chains that are isolated from the vasculature (11Parthasarathy N.

In the present study, we examine the effect of osmotic forces on the heparin/antithrombin interaction. Antithrombin is a prototype metastable protein, and its activation by heparin appears to result from the release of several structural constraints (6Lawrence D.A. Nat. Struct.

Considerable evidence indicates that antithrombin undergoes sequential changes in conformation during functional interactions with heparin and its target proteinases (2Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A.

The conformational changes initiated by heparin propagate throughout the antithrombin structure in ways that are not completely understood. Kinetically, it has been shown that the antithrombin/heparin interaction is a two-step reaction with a strong electrostatic component. An initial, low affinity step equilibrates very rapidly and induces the conformational transitions leading to high affinity interactions (8Desai U.R. Petitout M. Bjork I. Olson S.

Proteinase inhibition and heparin release are linked to reinsertion of antithrombin's reactive loop into a β-sheet structure in the protein's core and translocation of the proteinase from its initial low affinity interaction site in the exposed reactive loop to the other end of the antithrombin molecule (5Stratikos E.

The possibility that hydration water is transferred during heparin-induced conformational transitions has not been investigated before. The theoretical basis of the OS technique has been described and validated in detail (20Colombo M.F. Rau D.C. Parsegian V.A.

Many functional reactions of complex proteins like antithrombin are associated with conformational transitions that drastically alter the magnitude and distribution of their water-permeable spaces (19Liang J.

During these transitions, the change in free energy has a component corresponding to the work of water transfer. When the transition proceed in the presence of cosolutes that are excluded from the water-permeable spaces, the difference in water activity between the excluded spaces and bulk solution favor water transfer to bulk solution. The sensitivity of the free energy change, (ΔG), to water activity is a measure of the volume of water transferred during the transition and reflects differences in hydration between initial and final states. In the present work, OS is used with functional titrations to analyze antithrombin activation by heparin. Results show net water transfer from reactants to bulk on formation of the heparin-antithrombin complex and imply that functional GAG interactions are susceptible to osmotic regulation in vivo. The dissociation constant of the heparin/antithrombin interaction was determined from functional titrations under different osmotic stress conditions. The effect of osmotic stress on binding parameters was analyzed on the basis of the previously validated (18Olson S.T. Bjork I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) kinetic scheme. AT+H↔KhAT·H+fXa↔KtH·AT­fXa→kAT­fXa+HREACTION1Kh is the equilibrium dissociation constant for the antithrombin/heparin interaction (AT·H).Kt is the dissociation constant for the ternary interaction between fXa and the AT·H complex, and k is the first-order rate constant for the stabilization of the inhibitory complex. The observed pseudo-first-order rate constant,kobs, is a hyperbolic function of the AT·H complex concentration.kobs=k[AT·H]/(Kt+[AT·H])Equation 1 The stabilization of the complex is closely linked to the release of heparin. Although the mechanism that links heparin dissociation to the first-order stabilizing step is not clear, detailed kinetic analyses indicate that dissociation occurs either simultaneously or in a faster, subsequent step (18Olson S.T. Bjork I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 28Lee K.N. Im H. Kang S.W. Yu M.-H. J. Biol.

Functional titration experiments were performed within a concentration range of antithrombin (20–450 nm), giving Kt [tmt] [AT·H] and kobs = k[AT·H]/Kt, and at fixed and low heparin (20 nm) and fXa (10 nm). Under these conditions, the change in kobs with antithrombin concentration reflects the concentration of AT·H and follows the saturation curve of heparin with antithrombin (18Olson S.T. Bjork I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) from which a functionally determined dissociation constant, Kd, can be determined. Antithrombin and heparin were equilibrated in Tris buffer, 25 mm, pH 7.2–7.4 at 25 °C, with NaCl at either 0.075 or 0.2 n. Osmotic stress was induced with the following chemically inert cosolutes: polyethylene glycol,Mr 300 or 8000 (PEG 300 or 8000); dextran,Mr 10,000; or polyvinylpyrrolidone,Mr 40,000. Standard and “stressed” solutions were identical in all components except for the added cosolute. The difference in osmotic pressure generated by the added cosolute was determined from empirical relationships derived by direct osmotic pressure measurements (24McGee M.P. Teushler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15170-15174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 25Parsegian V.A. Rand R.P. Rau D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 43-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The change in [AT·H] with antithrombin was determined from the exponential rate,kobs, of fXa activity decay. The fXa activity was measured in six sequential samples withdrawn from reaction mixtures at 5–50-s intervals and diluted immediately in hexamethrine bromide (100 μg/ml). Residual protease activity was determined from the initial rate of substrate hydrolysis (methoxycarbonyl-d-cyclohexylglycylarginine-p-nitroanilide acetate), as described previously (32McGee M.P. Li L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8079-8085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In reaction mixtures without heparin or without antithrombin, the fXa activity did not change significantly during the reaction time. The possible effect of OS on the [AT·H]/fXa stoichiometry and changes in proportions of antithrombin branching into the substrate pathway was also investigated. In these experiments, antithrombin and fXa were incubated at various molar ratios with heparin at fixed concentration. Reactions were followed under either standard or OS conditions until completion. The stoichiometry was calculated as the abscissa intercept of linear regression plots of residual proteinase activity versus the antithrombin/fXa ratio (18Olson S.T. Bjork I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The quadratic form of the binding equation was fitted to data points (18Olson S.T. Bjork I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), using the computer program TableCurve (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC), and linear regression analyses were performed with the computer program Stat-View (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC.). Commercial-grade heparin with average molecular weight of ∼17,000 was purchased from Sigma. Fractionated heparin (molecular weight of 3000) and human antithrombin and factor Xa were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories. Experimentally, the possibility that a particular interaction is associated with net water transfer is determined from the difference in free energy change Δ(ΔG) with osmotic pressure. The direction of the water transfer is also deduced from the Δ(ΔG)/π slope. The slope is positive when transfer is from bulk to reactants. The slope is negative when transfer is from reactants to bulk. Changes in free energy are calculated from the binding parameters according to classical thermodynamic principles (33Glasstone S. Laidler K. Eyring H. The Theory of Rate Processes. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1941Google Scholar). Osmotic stress theory (20Colombo M.F. Rau D.C. Parsegian V.A.

A. 2000; 97: 3987-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) is derived from the theory of dilute solutions (34Wannier G.H. Statistical Physics. Dover Publications, New York1987: 336-383Google Scholar, 35Joos G. Freeman I.M. Theoretical Physics. Dover Publications, New York1986: 543-552Google Scholar), as it explains the indirect effects of cosolutes on macromolecules. It focuses on the role of hydration water in the region within and around a macromolecule from which cosolutes, but not water, are excluded. Detailed commentaries on various cosolute effects, such as crowding, preferential hydration, and binding, have been published (27Parsegian V.A. Rand R.P. Rau D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3987-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Here we summarize the theory only in relation to the antithrombin activation experiments we present. To analyze the antithrombin transformation between an F (heparin-free) and an B (inhibitory, heparin-bound) state, the osmotic stress technique can give a thermodynamic measurement of the hydration volume difference. The free energy difference from F to B is the free energy difference, ΔG between the bound (GB) and unbound forms of antithrombin (Ga) and heparin (Gh).ΔG=(Ga+Gh)−GBEquation 2 andΔG=−RT lnKEquation 3 K is a parameter measuring the ratio between the concentrations (or probabilities) of states F and B at equilibrium,R is the gas constant (1.987 cal/mol/degree), andT is the temperature (degrees Kelvin). The volume of water transfer is calculated from the equivalence: 1 atm × (volume of 1 mol of water) = 0.435 cal/mol. Thus, from the measured ratio Δ(ΔG)/π, (cal/mol/atm)/0.435 = mol H2O. In a multicomponent solution, such as those used to determine equilibrium parameters, the colligative properties, including the osmotic pressure, depend on the activity of all components. In our osmotic stress experiments, the activity of all components was held constant except for water and the inert cosolute used to induce osmotic stress. The composition of stressed and standard solutions was identical except for incremental additions of cosolute. The antithrombin and heparin molecules in the diluted solution used to measure equilibrium parameters are expected to influence the composition of the region of solution close to their surface, orsphere of influence (27Parsegian V.A. Rand R.P. Rau D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3987-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 34Wannier G.H. Statistical Physics. Dover Publications, New York1987: 336-383Google Scholar, 35Joos G. Freeman I.M. Theoretical Physics. Dover Publications, New York1986: 543-552Google Scholar). Focusing on the inert cosolute and the water within the antithrombin's sphere of influence, the solution will have Nw, andNc, molecules of water and cosolute, respectively, whereas in regions outside the sphere of influence the solution will have nw andnc molecules, respectively. Obviously, the sphere of influence includes all geometrical spaces within and near antithrombin, from which the cosolute is sterically excluded. However, following thermodynamic reasoning, the size of the sphere of influence is of no importance, because the osmotic stress on the molecule depends on the disproportion of cosolute and water within and outside the sphere (25Parsegian V.A. Rand R.P. Rau D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 43-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The Gibbs-Duhem (34Wannier G.H. Statistical Physics. Dover Publications, New York1987: 336-383Google Scholar) equation links the changes in chemical potential,dμ, within the antithrombin sphere of influence,dμa=−Nwdμw−Ncdμc,Equation 4 and at solution regions outside the antithrombin's sphere of influence,nwdμw+ncdμc=0.Equation 5 These relations express the fact that the changes in cosolute, dμc, and water, dμw, chemical potentials are directly linked. The same arguments apply to the chemical potential of heparin. The change in water's chemical potential can also be expressed by considering the change in osmotic pressure induced by cosolute.dμw=−VwdπEquation 6 Vw is the molecular volume of water, and dπ is the change in osmotic pressure induced by changes in cosolute concentration (34Wannier G.H. Statistical Physics. Dover Publications, New York1987: 336-383Google Scholar, 35Joos G. Freeman I.M. Theoretical Physics. Dover Publications, New York1986: 543-552Google Scholar). The change in chemical potential is closely related to Gibbs free energy and can be defined as the Gibbs free energy per molecule. This definition of the free energy is frequently used in utilitarian forms of the Second Law equation, and its derivation is based on Euler identity for homogeneous functions (34Wannier G.H. Statistical Physics. Dover Publications, New York1987: 336-383Google Scholar). From Equations Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6 above, we obtain Equation 7.dΔG=−ΔNewdμwEquation 7 New is the excess (or deficit) amount of water in regions within, as compared with outside, antithrombin's sphere of influence (27Parsegian V.A. Rand R.P. Rau D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3987-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). If New differs in the F and B states, then the change in the equilibrium parameter upon incremental additions of cosolute measures the water molecules transferred in going between the F and B state, as shown in Equations 8and 9.ΔNewFB=NewF−NewBEquation 8 andd(ΔGFB)/dπ=NewFBVwEquation 9 Therefore, the slope of the difference in free energy change (determined from changes in equilibrium constant) with osmotic pressure gives the amount of water transferred as reactants go from the F to the B state. On the basis of transition-state theory (33Glasstone S. Laidler K. Eyring H. The Theory of Rate Processes. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1941Google Scholar), differences in the changes in free energy of activation with osmotic pressure can also be used to measure hydration volume changes. In this case, thermodynamic reasoning is applied to the formation of the activated complex, and the equilibrium considered is between the reactants and the activated complex. This activated complex corresponds to an intermediate transient conformation, the hydration of which is likely to differ from that of both the initial and final states. Therefore, it is not useful to correlate volumes with x-ray-derived structures, which are probably more closely related to the initial and final states. However, because rate measurements are much more sensitive than equilibrium constant determinations, the difference in the free energy of activation change is useful in detecting other possible secondary effects of cosolutes that are not osmotic. Water-permeable spaces excluded by the osmotic probes in antithrombin were analyzed from x-ray-derived structures of bound and free antithrombin using CAST software (36Liang J. Edelsbrunner H. Woodward C. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1884-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 37Liang J. Edelsbrunner H. Fu P. Sudhakar P. Subramanian S. Proteins. 1998; 33: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). CAST is a unique computational method that provides comprehensive identification and accurate measurement of surface concavities of various shapes and geometries. It implements algorithms, developed using analytical computational geometry, and formalizes intuitive notions to classify concave regions into voids, pockets, and depressions. Briefly, voids are completely buried without access to the outside. Pockets are connected to the outside through a constricted mouth opening and mouth openings connecting the inside of a concave pocket with bulk solvent spaces are defined unambiguously using a triangulation procedure. All pockets and voids on a protein are identified and their metric properties, including both the pocket and mouth, determined analytically. The location of all pockets and voids, their atomic composition, volume, and the area of the mouths collectively describe the shape and specific physicochemical environment of a protein, providing a unique hydration fingerprint for each protein structure. Hydration fingerprints of antithrombin conformers were calculated from x-ray-derived atomic coordinates in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank files 2ant (30Skin"
https://openalex.org/W2033571156,"RGS9–1 is a GTPase-accelerating protein (GAP) required for rapid recovery of the light response in vertebrate rod and cone photoreceptors. Similar to its phototransduction partners transducin (G<sub>t</sub>) and cGMP phosphodiesterase, it is a peripheral protein of the disc membranes, but it binds membranes much more tightly. It lacks the lipid modifications found on G<sub>t</sub>and cGMP phosphodiesterase, and the mechanism for membrane attachment is unknown. We have used limited proteolysis to generate a fragment of RGS9–1 that is readily removed from membranes under moderate salt conditions. Immunoblots reveal that this soluble fragment lacks a 3-kDa fragment from the C-terminal domain, the only domain within RGS9–1 that differs in sequence from the brain-specific isoform RGS9–2. Recombinant fragments of RGS9–1 with or without the partner subunit Gβ<sub>5L</sub> were constructed with or without the C-terminal domain. Those lacking the C-terminal domain bound to photoreceptor membranes much less tightly than those containing it. Removal by urea of Gβ<sub>5L</sub> from endogenous or recombinant RGS9–1 bound to rod outer segment membranes left RGS9–1 tightly membrane-bound, and recombinant RGS9–1 was urea-soluble in the absence of membranes. Thus the C-terminal domain of RGS9–1 is critical for membrane binding, whereas Gβ<sub>5L</sub> does not play an important role in membrane attachment."
