https://openalex.org/W2743161869,"How neural correlates of movements are represented in the human brain is of ongoing interest and has been researched with invasive and non-invasive methods. In this study, we analyzed the encoding of single upper limb movements in the time-domain of low-frequency electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Fifteen healthy subjects executed and imagined six different sustained upper limb movements. We classified these six movements and a rest class and obtained significant average classification accuracies of 55% (movement vs movement) and 87% (movement vs rest) for executed movements, and 27% and 73%, respectively, for imagined movements. Furthermore, we analyzed the classifier patterns in the source space and located the brain areas conveying discriminative movement information. The classifier patterns indicate that mainly premotor areas, primary motor cortex, somatosensory cortex and posterior parietal cortex convey discriminative movement information. The decoding of single upper limb movements is specially interesting in the context of a more natural non-invasive control of e.g., a motor neuroprosthesis or a robotic arm in highly motor disabled persons."
https://openalex.org/W2743043185,"Tissue scaffolds provide structural support while facilitating tissue growth, but are challenging to design due to diverse property trade-offs. Here, a computational approach was developed for modeling scaffolds with lattice structures of eight different topologies and assessing properties relevant to bone tissue engineering applications. Evaluated properties include porosity, pore size, surface-volume ratio, elastic modulus, shear modulus, and permeability. Lattice topologies were generated by patterning beam-based unit cells, with design parameters for beam diameter and unit cell length. Finite element simulations were conducted for each topology and quantified how elastic modulus and shear modulus scale with porosity, and how permeability scales with porosity cubed over surface-volume ratio squared. Lattices were compared with controlled properties related to porosity and pore size. Relative comparisons suggest that lattice topology leads to specializations in achievable properties. For instance, Cube topologies tend to have high elastic and low shear moduli while Octet topologies have high shear moduli and surface-volume ratios but low permeability. The developed method was utilized to analyze property trade-offs as beam diameter was altered for a given topology, and used to prototype a 3D printed lattice embedded in an interbody cage for spinal fusion treatments. Findings provide a basis for modeling and understanding relative differences among beam-based lattices designed to facilitate bone tissue growth."
https://openalex.org/W2744385871,"Glycosylation is one of the most complex post translation modification in eukaryotic cells. Almost 50% of the human proteome is glycosylated as glycosylation plays a vital role in various biological functions such as antigen’s recognition, cell-cell communication, expression of genes and protein folding. It is a significant challenge to identify glycosylation sites in protein sequences as experimental methods are time taking and expensive. A reliable computational method is desirable for the identification of glycosylation sites. In this study, a comprehensive technique for the identification of N-linked glycosylation sites has been proposed using machine learning. The proposed predictor was trained using an up-to-date dataset through back propagation algorithm for multilayer neural network. The results of ten-fold cross-validation and other performance measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and Mathew’s correlation coefficient inferred that the accuracy of proposed tool is far better than the existing systems such as Glyomine, GlycoEP, Ensemble SVM and GPP."
https://openalex.org/W2743265017,"Pine wilt disease (PWD) constitutes a serious threat to pine forests. Since development depends on temperature and drought, there is a concern that future climate change could lead to the spread of PWD infections. We evaluated the risk of PWD in 21 susceptible Pinus species on a global scale. The MB index, which represents the sum of the difference between the mean monthly temperature and 15 when the mean monthly temperatures exceeds 15°C, was used to determine current and future regions vulnerable to PWD (MB ≥ 22). For future climate conditions, we compared the difference in PWD risks among four different representative concentration pathways (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) and two time periods (2050s and 2070s). We also evaluated the impact of climate change on habitat suitability for each Pinus species using species distribution models. The findings were then integrated and the potential risk of PWD spread under climate change was discussed. Within the natural Pinus distribution area, southern parts of North America, Europe, and Asia were categorized as vulnerable regions (MB ≥ 22; 16% of the total Pinus distribution area). Representative provinces in which PWD has been reported at least once overlapped with the vulnerable regions. All RCP scenarios showed expansion of vulnerable regions in northern parts of Europe, Asia, and North America under future climate conditions. By the 2070s, under RCP 8.5, an estimated increase in the area of vulnerable regions to approximately 50% of the total Pinus distribution area was revealed. In addition, the habitat conditions of a large portion of the Pinus distribution areas in Europe and Asia were deemed unsuitable by the 2070s under RCP 8.5. Approximately 40% of these regions overlapped with regions deemed vulnerable to PWD, suggesting that Pinus forests in these areas are at risk of serious damage due to habitat shifts and spread of PWD."
https://openalex.org/W2743281293,"Purpose To evaluate the association of computed tomography (CT) texture features of locally advanced rectal cancer with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) response and disease-free survival (DFS). Methods and findings The institutional review board approved this retrospective study. 95 patients who received neoadjuvant CRT, followed by surgery, for locally advanced rectal cancer were included. Texture features (entropy, uniformity, kurtosis, skewness, and standard deviation) were assessed in pretreatment CT images and obtained without filtration and with Laplacian of Gaussian spatial filter of various filter values (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5). Dworak pathologic grading was used for treatment response assessment. Independent t-test was used to compare each texture feature between the treatment responder and non-responder groups. DFS was assessed with Kaplan-Meier method, and differences were compared with log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to predict prognosis based on stage, age, and each texture feature. Treatment responders (n = 32) showed significantly lower entropy, higher uniformity, and lower standard deviation in no filtration, fine (1.0), and medium (1.5) filter values. Entropy, uniformity, and standard deviation without filtration showed significant difference in DFS in Kaplan-Meier analysis (P = 0.015, 0.025, and 0.038). Homogeneous texture features (≤ 6.7 for entropy, > 0.0118 for uniformity, and ≤ 28.06 for standard deviation) were associated with higher DFS. Entropy, uniformity, and standard deviation were independent texture features in predicting DFS (P = 0.017, 0.03, and 0.036) Conclusions Homogeneous texture features are associated with better neoadjuvant CRT response and higher DFS in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer."

A robust OPLS-DA model based on these identified metabolites was able to distinguish 82% of the UMI patients from health controls with a specificity of 92%. In this model, 44 metabolites were found differentially expressed in UMI subjects compared with health controls. By pathway enrichment analysis, we identified several major changed metabolic pathways related to UMI. Our findings provide new perspective for the diagnosis of UMI."
https://openalex.org/W2744386967,"Trauma-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (TIONFH) is a major complication of femoral neck fractures. Degeneration and necrosis of subchondral bone can cause collapse, which results in hip joint dysfunction in patients. The destruction of bone metabolism homeostasis is an important factor for osteonecrosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have an important role in regulating osteogenic differentiation, but the mechanisms underlying abnormal bone metabolism of TIONFH are poorly understood. In this study, we screened specific miRNAs in TIONFH by microarray and further explored the mechanism of osteogenic differentiation.Blood samples from patients with TIONFH and patients without necrosis after trauma were compared by microarray, and bone collapse of necrotic bone tissue was evaluated by micro-CT and immunohistochemistry. To confirm the relationship between miRNA and osteogenic differentiation, we conducted cell culture experiments. We found that many miRNAs were significantly different, including miR-93-5p; the increase in this miRNA was verified by Q-PCR. Comparison of the tissue samples showed that miR-93-5p expression increased, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteopontin (OPN) levels decreased, suggesting miR-93-5p may be involved in osteogenic differentiation. Further bioinformatics analysis indicated that miR-93-5p can target bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2). A luciferase gene reporter assay was performed to confirm these findings. By simulating and/or inhibiting miR-93-5p expression in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, we confirmed that osteogenic differentiation-related indictors, including BMP-2, Osterix, Runt-related transcription factor, ALP and OPN, were decreased by miR-93-5p.Our study showed that increased miR-93-5p in TIONFH patients inhibited osteogenic differentiation, which may be associated with BMP-2 reduction. Therefore, miR-93-5p may be a potential target for prevention of TIONFH."
https://openalex.org/W2744407340,"In order to illuminate the forming process of salted egg, the effects of the brine solution with different salt concentrations on the physicochemical properties, textural properties, and microstructures of duck eggs were evaluated using conventional physicochemical property determination methods. The results showed that the moisture contents of both the raw and cooked egg whites and egg yolks, the springiness of the raw egg yolks and cooked egg whites exhibited a decreasing trend with the increase in the salting time and salt concentration. The salt content, oil exudation and the hardness of the raw egg yolks showed a constantly increasing trend. Viscosity of the raw egg whites showed an overall trend in which it first deceased and then increased and decreased again, which was similar to the trend of the hardness of the cooked egg whites and egg yolks. As the salting proceeded, the pH value of the raw and cooked egg whites declined remarkably and then declined slowly, whereas the pH of the raw and cooked egg yolks did not show any noticeable changes. The effect of salting on the pH value varied significantly with the salt concentration in the brine solution. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that salted yolks consist of spherical granules and embedded flattened porosities. It was concluded that the treatment of salt induces solidification of yolk, accompanied with higher oil exudation and the development of a gritty texture. Different salt concentrations show certain differences."
https://openalex.org/W2745277338,"Arginine metabolism via inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase 2 (ARG2) is higher in asthmatics than in healthy individuals. We hypothesized that a sub-phenotype of asthma might be defined by the magnitude of arginine metabolism categorized on the basis of high and low fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO).To test this hypothesis, asthmatics (n = 52) were compared to healthy controls (n = 51) for levels of FENO, serum arginase activity, and airway epithelial expression of iNOS and ARG2 proteins, in relation to clinical parameters of asthma inflammation and airway reactivity. In parallel, bronchial epithelial cells were evaluated for metabolic effects of iNOS and ARG2 expression in vitro.Asthmatics with high FENO (≥ 35 ppb; 44% of asthmatics) had higher expression of iNOS (P = 0.04) and ARG2 (P = 0.05) in the airway, indicating FENO is a marker of the high arginine metabolic endotype. High FENO asthmatics had the lowest FEV1% (P < 0.001), FEV1/FVC (P = 0.0002) and PC20 (P < 0.001) as compared to low FENO asthmatics or healthy controls. Low FENO asthmatics had near normal iNOS and ARG2 expression (both P > 0.05), and significantly higher PC20 (P < 0.001) as compared to high FENO asthmatics. In vitro studies to evaluate metabolic effects showed that iNOS overexpression and iNOS+ARG2 co-expression in a human bronchial epithelial cell line led to greater reliance on glycolysis with higher rate of pyruvate going to lactate.The high FENO phenotype represents a large portion of the asthma population, and is typified by greater arginine metabolism and more severe and reactive asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2742573601,"Bacterial resistance to antibiotics remains an imposing global public health challenge. Of the most serious pathogens, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is problematic given strains have emerged that exhibit resistance to several antibiotic classes including β-lactams and agents of last resort such as vancomycin. New antibacterial agents composed of unique chemical scaffolds are needed to counter this public health challenge. The present study examines two synthetic diphenylurea compounds 1 and 2 that inhibit growth of clinically-relevant isolates of MRSA at concentrations as low as 4 µg/mL and are non-toxic to human colorectal cells at concentrations up to 128 μg/mL. Both compounds exhibit rapid bactericidal activity, completely eliminating a high inoculum of MRSA within four hours. MRSA mutants exhibiting resistance to 1 and 2 could not be isolated, indicating a low likelihood of rapid resistance emerging to these compounds. Bacterial cytological profiling revealed the diphenylureas exert their antibacterial activity by targeting bacterial cell wall synthesis. Both compounds demonstrate the ability to resensitize vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus to the effect of vancomycin. The present study lays the foundation for further investigation and development of diphenylurea compounds as a new class of antibacterial agents."
https://openalex.org/W2744918184,"Liver fibrosis is the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins, which is mainly caused by accumulation of activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). The mechanisms of activation and proliferation of HSCs, two key events after liver damage, have been studied for many years. Here we report a novel pathway to control HSCs by regulating glutamine metabolism. We demonstrated that the proliferation of HSCs is critically dependent on glutamine that is used to generate α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and non-essential amino acid (NEAA). In addition, both culture- and in vivo-activated HSCs have increased glutamine utilization and increased expression of genes related to glutamine metabolism, including GLS (glutaminase), aspartate transaminase (GOT1) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD1). Inhibition of these enzymes, as well as glutamine depletion, had a significant inhibitory effect on HSCs activation. In addition to providing energy expenditure, conversion of glutamine to proline is enhanced. The pool of free proline may also be increased via downregulation of POX expression. Hedgehog signaling plays an important role in the regulation of glutamine metabolism, as well as TGF-β1, c-Myc, and Ras signalings, via transcriptional upregulation and repression of key metabolic enzymes in this pathway. Finally, changes in glutamine metabolism were also found in mouse liver tissue following CCl4-induced acute injury. Conclusion: Glutamine metabolism plays an important role in regulating the proliferation and activation of HSCs. Strategies that are targeted at glutamine metabolism may represent a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of liver fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2743604784,"Morusin is a prenylated flavonoid isolated from the root bark of Morus alba. Many studies have shown the ability of flavonoids to act as anti-inflammatory agents. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of morusin on experimentally colitis induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzensulfonic acid in Wistar rats and to compare it with sulfasalazine, a drug conventionally used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Morusin was administered by gavage at doses of 12.5, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day for five days. The colonic tissue was evaluated macroscopically, histologically, and by performing immunodetection and zymographic analysis to determine the levels of antioxidant enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT)], interleukin (IL)-1β, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and the activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 2 and 9. The tissue damage scores were significantly reduced with increasing dose of morusin, however efficacy was not demonstrated at the highest dose. At the dose of 12.5 mg/kg, morusin exerted therapeutic effectivity similar to that of sulfasalazine (50 mg/kg). This was associated with significant reduction of TGF-β1 levels and MMP2 and MMP9 activities, and slight reduction of IL-1β. Our results suggest that morusin possesses therapeutic potential for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2744315378,"Sustainability of maize-based cropping systems is a major challenge for southern Africa, yet the demand for maize as staple food and animal feed in the region continues to increase. A study was conducted on a sandy clay loam (220 g clay kg-1 soil) at Domboshawa in Zimbabwe to investigate the long-term effects of organic resource quality and application rate, and nitrogen (N) fertilization on soil chemical properties and maize (Zea mays L.) productivity. Crotalaria juncea (high quality), Calliandra calothyrsus (medium quality), cattle manure (variable quality), maize stover and Pinus patula sawdust (both low quality) were incorporated into soil at 4.0 t C ha-1 (high rate) and 1.2 t C ha-1 (low rate) at the start of each cropping season for nine consecutive years. At both high and low application rates, each of the five organic resources was applied in combination with or without mineral nitrogen (N) fertilizer at 120 kg N ha-1. The nine-year period saw maize grain yields declining by 22% to 84% across treatments despite increases in soil organic carbon, total N and available P from 6% to 80%. Crotalaria, Calliandra and manure led to a less steep yield decline. Exchangeable calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and potassium (K), and soil pH explained much of the variation in yield patterns observed under the different organic resource applications. Maize grain yield was positively correlated with exchangeable Ca (r = 0.51), Mg (r = 0.62) and K (r = 0.53), and soil pH (r = 0.49), but negatively correlated with other soil properties over the 9-year period. We concluded that declining soil exchangeable basic cations were the underlying causes of decreasing maize productivity, and was aggravated by use of low rates of organic resource inputs, particularly with N fertilization. Current nutrient management and fertilizer recommendations that emphasize inorganic N, P and K significantly undervalue the role played by organic resources in sustainability of maize cropping systems in southern Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2744263771,"Objective The aim of this study was to report the basic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Methods The results of CSF analysis from 254 patients with PPMS were collected at four university hospitals in Germany. Routine CSF parameters and different indices of intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis were evaluated. We assessed possible correlations between the various CSF parameters and the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) both at the time of lumbar puncture and during the course of the disease. Results The median cell count and albumin concentration in the CSF did not deviate from normal values. The CSF-serum albumin-quotient (QALB) was elevated in 29.6% of the patients, while intrathecal immunoglobulin G (IgG) oligoclonal bands (OCBs) were detected in 91.1% of the patients. CSF-lactate levels as well as local IgM- and IgA-synthesis were correlated with the yearly disease progression rate, as assessed by EDSS. Conclusion We present the results of the hitherto largest and most detailed CSF biomarker profile in a cohort of 254 patients with PPMS. As reported previously, OCBs are the most sensitive marker for intrathecal IgG synthesis. CSF-lactate concentrations are positively correlated with the progression rate, which might suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a relevant role in PPMS. The negative correlation between intrathecally produced IgM and IgA and disease progression may indicate their hitherto unexplored protective role."
https://openalex.org/W2742513795,"Background Gout is an inflammatory disease that is caused by the increased production of Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) stimulated by monosodium urate (MSU) crystals. However, some hyperuricemia patients, even gouty patients with tophi in the joints, never experience gout attack, which indicates that pathogenic pathways other than MSU participate in the secretion of IL-1β in the pathogenesis of acute gouty arthritis. The ATP-P2X7R-IL-1β axis may be one of these pathways. Objective This study examines the role of Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the pathogenesis of gout and the association of ATP receptor (P2X7R) function with single nucleotide polymorphisms and gout arthritis. Methods Non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) loci of P2X7R in Chinese people were screened to compare the frequencies of different alleles and genotype distribution of selective SNPs in 117 gouty patients and 95 hyperuricemia patients. Peripheral white blood cells were purified from the peripheral blood of 43 randomly selected gout patients and 36 hyperuricemia patients from the total group. Cells were cultured with MSU or MSU + ATP, and supernatants were collected for the detection of IL-1β concentrations using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results 1. Eight SNP loci, including rs1653624, rs10160951, rs1718119, rs7958316, rs16950860, rs208294, rs17525809 and rs2230912, were screened and detected, and rs1653624, rs7958316 and rs17525809 were associated with gout arthritis. 2. IL-1β concentrations in supernatants after MSU + ATP stimulation were significantly higher in gouty patients than in the hyperuricemia group [(131.08 ± 176.11) pg/ml vs. (50.84 ± 86.10) pg/ml]; Patients (including gout and hyperuricemia) carrying the susceptibility genotype AA or AT of rs1653624 exhibited significantly higher concentrations of IL-1β than patients carrying the non-susceptibility genotype TT [(104.20 ± 164.25) pg/ml vs. (21.90 ± 12.14) pg/ml]; However, no differences were found with MSU stimulation alone. Conclusions ATP promotes the pathogenesis of gouty arthritis via increasing the secretion of IL-1 β, and its receptor (P2X7R) function associated single nucleotide polymorphisms may be related to gouty arthritis, which indicates that ATP-P2X7R signaling pathway plays a significant regulatory role in the pathogenesis of gout."
https://openalex.org/W2743247865,"High throughput sequencing technologies have revolutionized the identification of mutations responsible for genetic diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, approximately 50% of individuals with a clinical diagnosis of HCM have no causal mutation identified. This may be due to the presence of pathogenic mutations located deep within the introns, which are not detected by conventional sequencing analysis restricted to exons and exon-intron boundaries.The aim of this study was to develop a whole-gene sequencing strategy to prioritize deep intronic variants that may play a role in HCM pathogenesis.The full genomic DNA sequence of 26 genes previously associated with HCM was analysed in 16 unrelated patients. We identified likely pathogenic deep intronic variants in VCL, PRKAG2 and TTN genes. These variants, which are predicted to act through disruption of either splicing or transcription factor binding sites, are 3-fold more frequent in our cohort of probands than in normal European populations. Moreover, we found a patient that is compound heterozygous for a splice site mutation in MYBPC3 and the deep intronic VCL variant. Analysis of family members revealed that carriers of the MYBPC3 mutation alone do not manifest the disease, while family members that are compound heterozygous are clinically affected.This study provides a framework for scrutinizing variation along the complete intronic sequence of HCM-associated genes and prioritizing candidates for mechanistic and functional analysis. Our data suggest that deep intronic variation contributes to HCM phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2742327850,"Dermaseptin-B2 (DRS-B2) is a multifunctional cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAP) isolated from frog skin secretion. We previously reported that DRS-B2 possesses anticancer and antiangiogenic activities in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we evaluated the antiproliferative activity of DRS-B2 on numerous tumor cell lines, its cell internalization and studies of its molecular partners as well as their influences on its structure. Confocal microscopy using ([Alexa594]-(Cys0)-DRS-B2) shows that in sensitive human tumor cells (PC3), DRS-B2 seems to accumulate rapidly at the cytoplasmic membranes and enters the cytoplasm and the nucleus, while in less sensitive tumor cells (U87MG), DRS-B2 is found packed in vesicles at the cell membrane. Furthermore FACS analysis shows that PC3 cells viability decreases after DRS-B2 treatment while U87 MG seems to be unaffected. However, ""pull down"" experiments performed with total protein pools from PC3 or U87MG cells and the comparison between the antiproliferative effect of DRS-B2 and its synthetic analog containing all D-amino acids suggest the absence of a stereo-selective protein receptor. Pretreatment of PC3 cells with sodium chlorate, decreases the antiproliferative activity of DRS-B2. This activity is partially restored after addition of exogenous chondroitin sulfate C (CS-C). Moreover, we demonstrate that at nanomolar concentrations CS-C potentiates the antiproliferative effect of DRS-B2. These results highlight the partial implication of glycosaminoglycans in the mechanism of antiproliferative action of DRS-B2. Structural analysis of DRS-B2 by circular dichroism in the presence of increasing concentration of CS-C shows that DRS-B2 adopts an α-helical structure. Finally, structure-activity-relationship studies suggest a key role of the W residue in position 3 of the DRS-B2 sequence for its antiproliferative activity."
https://openalex.org/W2742512498,"Purpose To estimate the prevalence and causes of blindness and visual impairment (VI), and report the outcomes of cataract surgery in Chaonan Region, Guangdong Province, southern China Design Cross-sectional population-based survey Participants A total of 3484 participants including 1397 men (40.1%) and 2087 women (59.9%) aged ≥50 years were examined (94.2% response rate). Method A two-stage cluster sampling procedure was used to select 3700 participants aged ≥50 years from 74 clusters of Chaonan Region. Participants were examined according to the Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Blindness (RAAB) method. Blindness and visual impairment (VI) were defined by the World Health Organization criteria. Participants with visual acuity (VA) < 6/18 in either eye were examined by ophthalmologists. The primary causes of blindness and VI were reported with reference to the participant’s better eye. Main outcome measures Prevalence and main causes of blindness, severe visual impairment (SVI), VI and the outcomes of cataract surgery Results The standardized prevalence rates of blindness, SVI, and VI were 2.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9–2.9%), 1.0% (95% CI, 0.7–1.4%), and 6.4% (95% CI, 5.6%– 7.1%), respectively. The principal cause of blindness and SVI was cataract, accounting for 67.1% and 67.6% respectively, and the principal cause of VI was refractive error (46.9%). One hundred and fifty five out of 3484 (4.4%) people (211 eyes) had cataract surgery. Of the 211 eyes that had cataract surgery, 96.7% were pseudophakic. 67.2% of the 211 operated eyes had a presenting visual acuity (PVA) of 6/18 or better. Conclusions The prevalence of blindness, SVI, and VI was high among rural residents in Chaonan. Cataract remained the leading cause of avoidable blindness. Outcomes of cataract surgery performed in rural private clinics were suboptimal. Quality-control initiatives such as hands-on training program should be introduced to improve cataract surgery outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2742970274,"Virulence profiles and innate immune responses were studied in Acinetobacter baumannii from nosocomial infections collected over one year in a tertiary care hospital in Mexico. A. baumannii were identified by VITEK 2 System followed by susceptibility tests. Carbapenemase genes, active efflux mechanism to imipenem and meropenem and outer membrane proteins profile were analyzed to evaluate their role on the activity of carbapenem resistance. All isolates were genotyped by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. The ability to form biofilm was determined on a polystyrene surface. The resistance to complement was determined with a pooled human normal serum and TNFα release by infected macrophages was determined by ELISA. The 112 isolates from this study were associated with a 52% of mortality. All were resistance to β-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and trimethroprim-sulfamethoxal, 96 and 90% were resistant to meropenem and imipenem, respectively, but with high susceptibility to polymyxin B, colistin and tigecyclin. Isolates were classified in 11 different clones. Most isolates, 88% (99/112), were metallo-β-lactamases and carbapenemases producers, associated in 95% with the presence of blaOXA-72 gene. Only 4/99 and 1/99 of the carbapenem-resistant isolates were related to efflux mechanism to meropenem or imipenem resistance, respectively. The loss of expression of 22, 29, and/or 33-36-kDa proteins was detected in 8/11 of the clinical isolates with resistance to carbapenem. More than 96% (108/112) of the isolates were high producers of biofilms on biotic surfaces. Finally, all isolates showed variable resistance to normal human serum activity and were high inductors of TNFα release by macrophages. In summary, these results suggest that multidrug-resistant A. baumannii can persist in the hospital environment through its ability to form biofilms. The high mortality observed was due to their ability to survive normal human serum activity and capability to induce potent inflammatory immune response making this nosocomial pathogen a serious threat to hospitalized patients."
https://openalex.org/W2743654770,"Displaying a strong antiproliferative activity on a wide variety of cancer cells, EAPB0203 and EAPB0503 belong to the imidazo[1,2-a]quinoxalines family of imiquimod structural analogues. EAPB0503 has been shown to inhibit tubulin polymerization. The aim of the present study is to characterize the interaction of EAPB0203 and EAPB0503 with tubulin. We combine experimental approaches at the cellular and the molecular level both in vitro and in silico in order to evaluate the interaction of EAPB0203 and EAPB0503 with tubulin. We examine the influence of EAPB0203 and EAPB0503 on the cell cycle and fate, explore the binding interaction with purified tubulin, and use a computational molecular docking model to determine the binding modes to the microtubule. We then use a drug combination study with other anti-microtubule agents to compare the binding site of EAPB0203 and EAPB0503 to known potent tubulin inhibitors. We demonstrate that EAPB0203 and EAPB0503 are capable of blocking human melanoma cells in G2 and M phases and inducing cell death and apoptosis. Second, we show that EAPB0203 and EAPB0503, but also unexpectedly imiquimod, bind directly to purified tubulin and inhibit tubulin polymerization. As suggested by molecular docking and binding competition studies, we identify the colchicine binding site on β-tubulin as the interaction pocket. Furthermore, we find that EAPB0203, EAPB0503 and imiquimod display antagonistic cytotoxic effect when combined with colchicine, and disrupt tubulin network in human melanoma cells. We conclude that EAPB0203, EAPB0503, as well as imiquimod, interact with tubulin through the colchicine binding site, and that the cytotoxic activity of EAPB0203, EAPB0503 and imiquimod is correlated to their tubulin inhibiting effect. These compounds appear as interesting anticancer drug candidates as suggested by their activity and mechanism of action, and deserve further investigation for their use in the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W2742673766,"Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy types 2D and 2F (LGMD 2D and 2F) are autosomal recessive disorders caused by mutations in the alpha- and delta sarcoglycan genes, respectively, leading to severe muscle weakness and degeneration. The cause of the disease has been well characterized and a number of animal models are available for pre-clinical studies to test potential therapeutic interventions. To facilitate transition from drug discovery to clinical trials, standardized procedures and natural disease history data were collected for these mouse models. Implementing the TREAD-NMD standardized operating procedures, we here subjected LGMD2D (SGCA-null), LGMD2F (SGCD-null) and wild type (C57BL/6J) mice to five functional tests from the age of 4 to 32 weeks. To assess whether the functional test regime interfered with disease pathology, sedentary groups were taken along. Muscle physiology testing of tibialis anterior muscle was performed at the age of 34 weeks. Muscle histopathology and gene expression was analysed in skeletal muscles and heart. Muscle histopathology and gene expression was analysed in skeletal muscles and heart. Mice successfully accomplished the functional tests, which did not interfere with disease pathology. Muscle function of SGCA- and SGCD-null mice was impaired and declined over time. Interestingly, female SGCD-null mice outperformed males in the two and four limb hanging tests, which proved the most suitable non-invasive tests to assess muscle function. Muscle physiology testing of tibialis anterior muscle revealed lower specific force and higher susceptibility to eccentric-induced damage in LGMD mice. Analyzing muscle histopathology and gene expression, we identified the diaphragm as the most affected muscle in LGMD strains. Cardiac fibrosis was found in SGCD-null mice, being more severe in males than in females. Our study offers a comprehensive natural history dataset which will be useful to design standardized tests and future pre-clinical studies in LGMD2D and 2F mice."
https://openalex.org/W2744166982,"Bangladesh has a population with a low gastric cancer risk but high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection. Several studies have examined virulence genes in H. pylori from Bangladesh. We analyzed cagA and vacA subtypes and their association with severe histology phenotypes, and analyzed population types among Bangladeshi strains. We included patients who underwent endoscopy in Dhaka. Sequences of virulence genes and seven housekeeping genes were obtained by next generation sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. We isolated 56 H. pylori strains from 133 patients, of which 73.2% carried cagA, and all were considered Western-type. Patients infected with cagA-positive strains had more severe histological scores than patients infected with cagA-negative strains. Among vacA s1 and m1 genotypes, the s1a (97.8%, 43/44) and m1c (28/30, 93.3%) genotypes were predominant. All strains containing s1 and m1 (30/56, 53.6%) also had i1, d1, and c1. In contrast, all strains containing the less-virulent genotypes s2 and m2 (12/56, 21.4%) also possessed i2, d2, and c2. Multivariate analysis indicated that subjects infected with vacA m1-genotype strains only had a significantly higher risk of antrum atrophy than patients infected with m2-genotype strains. Of the two main H. pylori populations in this study, hpAsia2 strains were associated with higher activity and inflammation in the antrum compared to hpEurope strains; however, only vacA s1m1i1d1c1 strains, independent of population type, were significantly associated with inflammation in the antrum, unlike the s2m2i2d2c2 genotype. In conclusion, Bangladeshi strains were divided into two main populations of different genotypes. The low incidence of gastric cancer in Bangladesh might be attributable to the high proportion of less-virulent genotypes, which may be a better predictor of gastric cancer risk than the ancestral origin of the H. pylori strains. Finally, the vacA m region may be a better virulence marker than other regions."
https://openalex.org/W2744056428,"The olive fruit fly Bactrocera oleae (Diptera: Tephritidae) is the most devastating pest of cultivated olive (Olea europaea L.). Intraspecific variation in plant resistance to B. oleae has been described only at phenotypic level. In this work, we used a transcriptomic approach to study the molecular response to the olive fruit fly in two olive cultivars with contrasting level of susceptibility. Using next-generation pyrosequencing, we first generated a catalogue of more than 80,000 sequences expressed in drupes from approximately 700k reads. The assembled sequences were used to develop a microarray layout with over 60,000 olive-specific probes. The differential gene expression analysis between infested (i.e. with II or III instar larvae) and control drupes indicated a significant intraspecific variation between the more tolerant and susceptible cultivar. Around 2500 genes were differentially regulated in infested drupes of the tolerant variety. The GO annotation of the differentially expressed genes implies that the inducible resistance to the olive fruit fly involves a number of biological functions, cellular processes and metabolic pathways, including those with a known role in defence, oxidative stress responses, cellular structure, hormone signalling, and primary and secondary metabolism. The difference in the induced transcriptional changes between the cultivars suggests a strong genetic role in the olive inducible defence, which can ultimately lead to the discovery of factors associated with a higher level of tolerance to B. oleae."
https://openalex.org/W2744476785,"There is widespread vitamin and mineral deficiency problem in Tanzania with known deficiencies of at least vitamin A, iron, folate and zinc, resulting in lasting negative consequences especially on maternal health, cognitive development and thus the nation’s economic potential. Folate deficiency is associated with significant adverse health effects among women of reproductive age, including a higher risk of neural tube defects. Several countries, including Tanzania, have implemented mandatory fortification of wheat and maize flour but evidence on the effectiveness of these programs in developing countries remains limited. We evaluated the effectiveness of Tanzania’s food fortification program by examining folate levels for women of reproductive age, 18–49 years. A prospective cohort study with 600 non-pregnant women enrolled concurrent with the initiation of food fortification and followed up for 1 year thereafter. Blood samples, dietary intake and fortified foods consumption data were collected at baseline, and at 6 and 12 months. Plasma folate levels were determined using a competitive assay with folate binding protein. Using univariate and multivariate linear regression, we compared the change in plasma folate levels at six and twelve months of the program from baseline. We also assessed the relative risk of folate deficiency during follow-up using log-binomial regression. The mean (±SE) pre–fortification plasma folate level for the women was 5.44-ng/ml (±2.30) at baseline. These levels improved significantly at six months [difference: 4.57ng/ml (±2.89)] and 12 months [difference: 4.27ng/ml (±4.18)]. Based on plasma folate cut-off level of 4 ng/ml, the prevalence of folate deficiency was 26.9% at baseline, and 5% at twelve months. One ng/ml increase in plasma folate from baseline was associated with a 25% decreased risk of folate deficiency at 12 months [(RR = 0.75; 95% CI = 0.67–0.85, P<0.001]. In a setting where folate deficiency is high, food fortification program with folic acid resulted in significant improvements in folate status among women of reproductive age."
https://openalex.org/W2742667957,"Impaired protein clearance likely increases the risk of protein accumulation disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Protein degradation through the proteasome pathway decreases with age and in AD brains, and the Aβ42 peptide has been shown to impair proteasome function in cultured cells and in a cell-free model. Here, Aβ42 was studied in brain tissue to measure changes in protein clearance pathways and related secondary pathology. Oligomerized Aβ42 (0.5–1.5 μM) reduced proteasome activity by 62% in hippocampal slice cultures over a 4-6-day period, corresponding with increased tau phosphorylation and reduced synaptophysin levels. Interestingly, the decrease in proteasome activity was associated with a delayed inverse effect, >2-fold increase, regarding lysosomal cathepsin B (CatB) activity. The CatB enhancement did not correspond with the Aβ42-mediated phospho-tau alterations since the latter occurred prior to the CatB response. Hippocampal slices treated with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin also exhibited an inverse effect on CatB activity with respect to diminished proteasome function. Lactacystin caused earlier CatB enhancement than Aβ42, and no correspondence was evident between up-regulated CatB levels and the delayed synaptic pathology indicated by the loss of pre- and postsynaptic markers. Contrasting the inverse effects on the proteasomal and lysosomal pathways by Aβ42 and lactacystin, such were not found when CatB activity was up-regulated two-fold with Z-Phe-Ala-diazomethylketone (PADK). Instead of an inverse decline, proteasome function was increased marginally in PADK-treated hippocampal slices. Unexpectedly, the proteasomal augmentation was significantly pronounced in Aβ42-compromised slices, while absent in lactacystin-treated tissue, resulting in >2-fold improvement for nearly complete recovery of proteasome function by the CatB-enhancing compound. The PADK treatment also reduced Aβ42-mediated tau phosphorylation and synaptic marker declines, corresponding with the positive modulation of both proteasome activity and the lysosomal CatB enzyme. These findings indicate that proteasomal stress contributes to AD-type pathogenesis and that governing such pathology occurs through crosstalk between the two protein clearance pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2744843593,"Macroscopic mechanical properties of human skin in vivo cannot be considered independent of adjacent subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). The layered system skin/sWAT appears as the hierarchical structural composite in which single layers behave as fiber-reinforced structures. Effective macroscopic mechanical properties of such composites are mainly determined either by the properties of the skin or by those of the sWAT, dependent on the conditions of mechanical loading. Mechanical interactions between the skin and the adjacent sWAT associated with a mismatch in the mechanical moduli of these two layers can lead to production of the skin wrinkles. Reinforcement of the composite skin/sWAT can take place in different ways. It can be provided through reorientation of collagen fibers under applied loading, through production of new bonds between existing collagen fibers and through induction of additional collagen structures. Effectiveness of this type of reinforcement is strongly dependent on the type of mechanical loading. Different physical interventions induce the reinforcement of at least one of these two layers, thus increasing the effective macroscopic stiffness of the total composite. At the same time, the standalone reinforcement of the skin appears to be less effective to achieve a delay or a reduction of the apparent signs of skin aging relative to the reinforcement of the sWAT."
https://openalex.org/W2742960504,"Magnesium (Mg)-based stents are extensively explored to alleviate atherosclerosis due to their biodegradability and relative hemocompatibility. To ensure the quality, safety and cost-efficacy of bioresorbable scaffolds and full utilization of the material tunability afforded by alloying, it is critical to access degradability and thrombosis potential of Mg-based alloys using improved in vitro models that mimic as closely as possible the in vivo microenvironment. In this study, we investigated biodegradation and initial thrombogenic behavior of Mg-based alloys at the interface between Mg alloys' surface and simulated physiological environment using a microfluidic system. The degradation properties of Mg-based alloys WE43, AZ31, ZWEK-L, and ZWEK-C were evaluated in complete culture medium and their thrombosis potentials in platelet rich plasma, respectively. The results show that 1) physiological shear stress increased the corrosion rate and decreased platelets adhesion rate as compared to static immersion; 2) secondary phases and impurities in material composition induced galvanic corrosion, resulting in higher corrosion resistance and platelet adhesion rate; 3) Mg-based alloys with higher corrosion rate showed higher platelets adhesion rate. We conclude that a microfluidic-based in vitro system allows evaluation of biodegradation behaviors and platelets responses of Mg-based alloys under specific shear stress, and degradability is related to platelets adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2743194038,"Background The ability to sustain intense exercise seems to be partially limited by the body’s capability to counteract decreases in both intra- and extracellular pH. While the influence of an enhanced buffering capacity via sodium bicarbonate (BICA) on short-term, high-intensity exercise performance has been repeatedly investigated, studies on prolonged endurance performances are comparatively rare, especially for running. The aim of the following study was to assess the ergogenic effects of an oral BICA substitution upon exhaustive intensive endurance running performance. Method In a double-blind randomized cross-over study, 18 trained runners (VO2peak: 61.2 ± 6.4 ml•min-1•kg-1) performed two exhaustive graded exercise tests and two constant load tests (30 main at 95% individual anaerobic threshold (IAT) followed by 110% IAT until exhaustion) after ingestion of either sodium bicarbonate (BICA) (0.3 g/kg) or placebo (4 g NaCl) diluted in 700 ml of water. Time to exhaustion (TTE) in the constant load test was defined as the main outcome measure. Throughout each test respiratory gas exchange measurements were conducted as well as determinations of heart rate, blood gases and blood lactate concentration. Results TTE in the constant load test did not differ significantly between BICA and placebo conditions (BICA: 39.6 ± 5.6 min, placebo: 39.3 ± 5.6 min; p = 0.78). While pH in the placebo test dropped to a slightly acidotic value two minutes after cessation of exercise (7.34 ± 0.05) the value in the BICA trial remained within the normal range (7.41 ± 0.06) (p < 0.001). In contrast, maximum running speed (Vmax) in the exhaustive graded exercise test was significantly higher with BICA (17.4 ± 1.0 km/h) compared to placebo (17.1 ± 1.0 km/h) (p = 0.009). The numerical difference in maximum oxygen consumption (VO2peak) failed to reach statistical significance (BICA: 61.2 ± 6.4 ml•min-1•kg-1, placebo: 59.8 ± 6.4 ml•min-1•kg-1; p = 0.31). Maximum blood lactate was significantly higher with BICA compared to the corresponding placebo test (BICA: 11.1 ± 2.3 mmol/l, placebo: 8.9 ± 3.0 mmol/l; p < 0.001). At the end of exercise, an acidotic pH value was found in both exhaustive graded exercise tests (p = 0.002). BICA caused gastrointestinal side effects in 15 patients. Conclusion Maximal performance was enhanced significantly after BICA administration. The ergogenic effect of BICA in the exhaustive graded exercise test can most likely be attributed to an increased anaerobic glycolysis that is reflected by an accumulation of lactate. However, TTE in prolonged high-intensity running was not improved. Even at the end of exercise no severe metabolic acidosis was found. Metabolic acidification as one of the dominant factors causing muscular fatigue should therefore be reconsidered. Trial registration German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS) DRKS00011284."
https://openalex.org/W2743488938,"Primary cilia are non-motile cilia that serve as cellular antennae for sensing and transducing extracellular signals. In general, primary cilia are generated by cell quiescence signals. Recent studies have shown that manipulations to increase actin assembly suppress quiescence-induced ciliogenesis. To further examine the role of actin dynamics in ciliogenesis, we analyzed the effect of jasplakinolide (Jasp), a potent inducer of actin polymerization, on ciliogenesis. Unexpectedly, Jasp treatment induced ciliogenesis in serum-fed cells cultured at low density. In contrast, Jasp had no apparent effect on ciliogenesis in cells cultured at higher densities. Jasp-induced ciliogenesis was correlated with a change in cell morphology from a flat and adherent shape to a round and weakly adherent one. Jasp treatment also induced the phosphorylation and cytoplasmic localization of the YAP transcriptional co-activator and suppressed cell proliferation in low density-cultured cells. Overexpression of an active form of YAP suppressed Jasp-induced ciliogenesis. These results suggest that Jasp induces ciliogenesis through cell rounding and cytoplasmic localization and inactivation of YAP. Knockdown of LATS1/2 only faintly suppressed Jasp-induced YAP phosphorylation, indicating that LATS1/2 are not primarily responsible for Jasp-induced YAP phosphorylation. Furthermore, overexpression of active Src kinase suppressed Jasp-induced cytoplasmic localization of YAP and ciliogenesis, suggesting that down-regulation of Src activity is involved in Jasp-induced YAP inactivation and ciliogenesis. Our data suggest that actin polymerization does not suppress ciliogenesis per se but rather that cell rounding and reduced cell adhesion are more crucially involved in Jasp-induced ciliogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2743638843,"Understanding suicidality has proven challenging given the complex aetiology in early childhood. Being able to accurately predict groups at increased risk of developing suicidal thoughts may aid in the development of targeted prevention programs that mitigate increased vulnerability. Further, the predictors of suicidal thoughts may be shared with other outcomes in adolescence. Previous research has linked many factors to suicidality, so the objective of this study was to consider how these factors may act together to increase risk of suicidal thoughts and other non-mental health outcomes.Two longitudinal datasets were used in this analysis: the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY) and the Avon Longitudinal Survey of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). A Classification and Regression Tree model comprised of 75 factors describing early childhood was constructed to identify subgroups of adolescents at high risk of suicidal thoughts in the NLSCY and was validated in ALSPAC. These subgroups were investigated to see if they also had elevated rates of antisocial behaviour, substance misuse, poor physical health, poor mental health, risky health behaviours, and/or poor academic performance.The sensitivity was calculated to be 22·7%, specificity was 89·2%, positive predictive value 17·8%, and negative predictive value 91·8% and had similar accuracy in the validation dataset. The models were better at predicting other adverse outcomes compared to suicidal thoughts.There are groups of risk factors present in early life that can predict higher risk of suicidality in adolescence. Notably, these factors were also predictive of a range of adverse outcomes in adolescence."

An adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller with an integral sliding surface is developed for the grid-connected inverter where a fuzzy system is used to approach the upper bound of the system nonlinearities. The proposed strategy has strong robustness for the sliding mode control can be designed independently and disturbances can be adaptively compensated. Simulation results of a PV grid-connected system verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating the satisfactory robustness and performance."
https://openalex.org/W2743274282,"Myeloid cell and hepatocyte IKKβ may mediate the genesis of obesity and insulin resistance in mice fed high fat diet. However, their gender-specific roles in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are not known. Here we demonstrate myeloid IKKβ deficiency prevents Western diet-induced obesity and visceral adiposity in females but not in males, and attenuates hyperglycemia, global IR, and NASH in both genders. In contrast, all metabolic sequela including NASH are aggravated by hepatocyte IKKβ deficiency (IkbkbΔhep) in male but not female mice. Gene profiling identifies sulfotransferase family 1E (Sult1e1), which encodes a sulfotransferase E1 responsible for inactivation of estrogen, as a gene upregulated in NASH in both genders and most conspicuously in male IkbkbΔhep mice having worst NASH and lowest plasma estradiol levels. LXRα is enriched to LXRE on Sult1e1 promoter in male WT and IkbkbΔhep mice with NASH, and a Sult1e1 promoter activity is increased by LXRα and its ligand and augmented by expression of a S32A mutant of IκBα. These results demonstrate striking gender differences in regulation by IKKβ of high cholesterol saturated fat diet-induced metabolic changes including NASH and suggest hepatocyte IKKβ is protective in male due at least in part to its ability to repress LXR-induced Sult1e1. Our findings also raise a caution for systemic IKK inhibition for the treatment of NASH as it may exacerbate the disease in male patients."

The absorption, distribution, metabolism and most importantly, the elimination of tetracycline (TC) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in edible plants Brassica rapa chinensis and Ipomoea aquatica grown hydroponically were demonstrated and studied using non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis. The results revealed drug-dependent and vegetable-dependent pharmacokinetic differences and indicated that ephemeral vegetables could have high capacity accumulating antibiotics (up to 160 μg g-1 for TC and 38 μg g-1 for SMX) within hours. TC concentration in the root (Cmax) could reach 11 times higher than that in the cultivation fluid and 3-28 times higher than the petioles/stems. Based on the volume of distribution (Vss), SMX was 3-6 times more extensively distributed than TC. Both antibiotics showed evident, albeit slow elimination phase with elimination half-lives ranging from 22 to 88 hours. For the first time drug elimination through the roots of a plant was demonstrated, and by viewing the root as a central compartment and continuous infusion without a loading dose as drug administration mode, it is possible to pharmacokinetically monitor the movement of antibiotics and their fate in the vegetables with more detailed information not previously available.

Here, we aimed to examine the effect of meniscus coverage on the characteristics of this unit in knees of older individuals.We assessed the hyaline cartilage, subchondral cortical plate (SCP), and subchondral trabecular bone in areas covered or uncovered by the meniscus from normal cadaver knees (without degeneration). Bone cores harvested from the medial tibial plateau at locations uncovered (central), partially covered (posterior), and completely covered (peripheral) by the meniscus were imaged by micro-CT. The following were measured on images: cartilage volume (Cart.Vol, mm3) and thickness (Cart.Th, mm); SCP thickness (SCP.Th, μm) and porosity (SCP.Por, %); bone volume to total volume fraction (BV/TV, %); trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, μm), spacing (Tb.Sp, μm), and number (Tb.N, 1/mm); structure model index (SMI); trabecular pattern factor (Tb.Pf); and degree of anisotropy (DA).Among the 28 specimens studied (18 females) from individuals with mean age 82.8±10.2 years, cartilage and SCP were thicker at the central site uncovered by the meniscus than the posterior and peripheral sites, and Cart.Vol was greater. SCP.Por was highest in posterior samples. In the upper 1-5 mm of subchondral bone, central samples were characterized by higher values for BV/TV, Tb.N, Tb.Th, and connectivity (Tb.Pf), a more plate-like trabecular structure and lower anisotropy than with other samples. Deeper down, at 6-10 mm, the differences were slightly higher for Tb.Th centrally, DA peripherally and SMI posteriorly.The coverage or not by meniscus in the knee of older individuals is significantly associated with Cart.Th, SCP.Th, SCP.Por and trabecular microarchitectural parameters in the most superficial 5 mm and to a lesser extent the deepest area of subchondral trabecular bone. These results suggest an effect of differences in local loading conditions. In subchondral bone uncovered by the meniscus, the trabecular architecture resembles that of highly loaded areas."

O157 colonize the recto-anal junction (RAJ) of asymptomatic cattle who shed the bacterium into the environment through fecal matter. A small subset of cattle, termed super-shedders (SS), excrete O157 at a rate (≥ 104 CFU/g of feces) that is several orders of magnitude greater than other colonized cattle and play a major role in the prevalence and transmission of O157. To better understand microbial factors contributing to super-shedding we have recently sequenced two SS isolates, SS17 (GenBank accession no. CP008805) and SS52 (GenBank accession no. CP010304) and shown that SS isolates display a distinctive strongly adherent phenotype on bovine rectal squamous epithelial cells. Here we present a detailed comparative genomics analysis of SS17 and SS52 with other previously characterized O157 strains (EC4115, EDL933, Sakai, TW14359). The results highlight specific polymorphisms and genomic features shared amongst SS strains, and reveal several SNPs that are shared amongst SS isolates, including in genes involved in motility, adherence, and metabolism. Finally, our analyses reveal distinctive patterns of distribution of phage-associated genes amongst the two SS and other isolates. Together, the results of our comparative genomics studies suggest that while SS17 and SS52 share genomic features with other lineage I/II isolates, they likely have distinct recent evolutionary histories.

The influences of circuit conditions on arc dynamic image, voltage, current or power were interpreted. Also, the temperature rises of electrode surface and ambient air were studied. The results showed that, first, significant variations of arc structure and light emitting were observed under different conditions. A thin outer burning layer of vapor generated from electrodes with orange light was found due to the extremely high arc temperature. Second, with the increasing electrode gap in discharging, the arc power was shown to have a non monotonic relationship with arc length for constant initial circuit voltage and resistance.

Using human megakaryocytic cell line, MEG-01, we show that expression of cell cycle genes in these cells are altered upon A. phagocytophilum infection. Expression of several cell cycle genes in MEG-01 cells was significantly up regulated at early and then down regulated at later stages of A. phagocytophilum infection. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays revealed reduced cellular cytotoxicity in MEG-01 cells upon A. phagocytophilum infection.

Inhibition of PI3 kinases with LY294002 treatment resulted in significant reduction in the expression of tested cell cycle genes, A. phagocytophilum burden and phosphorylated Akt levels in these MEG-01 cells. Collectively, these results suggest a role for PI3K-Akt-NF-κB signaling pathway in the modulation of megakaryocyte cell cycle genes upon A. phagocytophilum infection."

However, its precise effects on eating behaviour are still unclear, especially with food available for extended periods of time. This study involved two similar high school student groups (15–17 years old), which had ad libitum access to grapes, chocolates and crackers during an hour-long experimental session. In the distal condition the foods were placed 6 meters away from the students (n = 24), in contrast to the proximal condition (n = 17) were the food was placed near the students. The identification of the type and the quantification of the amount of each food selected, for each individual serving, was facilitated through use of food scales and video recording. In the proximal condition individuals served themselves grapes and crackers more often and consumed more chocolate than in the distal condition. In total, participants in the proximal condition ingested significantly more energy (726 kcal vs. 504 kcal; p = 0.029), without reporting higher fullness. Food proximity also affected the temporal distribution of servings, with the first five minutes of the sessions corresponding to 53.1% and 45.6% of the total energy intake for the distal and proximal conditions, respectively. After the first five minutes, the servings in the distal condition were strongly clustered in time, with many students getting food together. In the proximal condition however, students displayed an unstructured pattern of servings over time. In conclusion, this study strengthens past evidence regarding the important role of food proximity on individual energy intake and, for the first time, it associates continuous food proximity to the emergence of unstructured eating over time. These conclusions, expanded upon by future studies, could support the creation of meaningful intervention strategies based on spatially and temporally controlled food availability."
https://openalex.org/W2742996041,"The Warburg Effect, characterized by increased rate of glycolysis even under normoxic conditions, is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Relatively lower oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is also a characteristic feature in cancer cells. We hypothesized that interference with this phenomenon, by introducing exogenous pyruvate, would upset this cancer phenotype and boost the energy requirements of normal cells. We find that methyl pyruvate protects irinotecan-treated normal lung fibroblast cell line (MRC-5) probably by turning off the p53/p21 axis of the apoptotic pathways. When the MRC-5 fibroblasts recover in drug-free medium, the intrinsic apoptotic pathway is also turned off and the cells survive with no discernible exponential growth during the observation period. In contrast, the mere introduction of exogenous pyruvate kills the lung cancer cell line (A549). Although, functional p53 is important in the drug-induced cancer cell death, it is probably not essential because cancer cell lines with mutated p53 also die albeit less efficiently. We conclude that methyl pyruvate may preferentially kill cancer cells and protect normal cells during chemotherapy."

After that, we detect the expression of TFDP3 at the RNA level and protein level in L-02 cell line and HepG2 cell line, and the location of TFDP3 was defined by immunofluorescence technique. Furthermore, we synchronized the cells to G1 phase, S phase and G2 phase, and arrested cell mitosis. The localization of TFDP3 and co-localization with E2F1 molecules in different phases of hepatocyte lines. Finally, TFDP3 gene knockout was performed on L-02 and HepG2 cell lines, and detected the new cell cycles by flow cytometry. The result showed that the expression of TFDP3 molecule is negative in normal liver tissue, but positive in immortalized human hepatocyte cell line, and the expression level is lower than in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. The expression level of TFDP3 was in the dynamic change of L-02 and HepG2 cell lines, and was related to the phase transition. TFDP3 can bind to E2F1 molecule to form E2F/TFDP3 complex; and the localizations of TFDP3 and E2F1 molecules and the co-localization were different in different phases of cell cycle in the nucleus and cytoplasm, which indicated that the E2F/TFDP3 complex involved in the process of regulating the cell cycle. By knocking down the TFDP3 expression level in L-02 and HepG2 cell lines, the cell cycle would be arrested in S phase, which confirmed that TFDP3 can be a potential target for tumor therapy."

In this study we have demonstrated that previously identified morphological mutants (three chlorophyll deficient mutants, one male sterile-female fertile mutant, and three partial female sterile mutants) were caused by insertion of Tgm9 following its excision from DFR2. Analyses of Tgm9 insertion sites among 105 independent mutants demonstrated that Tgm9 hops to all 20 soybean chromosomes from its original location on Chromosome 17. Some genomic regions are prone to increased Tgm9-insertions. Tgm9 transposed over 25% of the time into exon or intron sequences. Tgm9 is therefore suitable for generating an indexed insertional mutant collection for functional analyses of most soybean genes. Furthermore, desirable Tgm9-induced stable knockout mutants can be utilized in generating improved traits for commercial soybean cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W2744362293,"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases-interacting multifunctional protein3 (AIMP3/p18) is involved in the macromolecular tRNA synthetase complex via its interaction with several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Recent reports reveal a novel function of AIMP3 as a tumor suppressor by accelerating cellular senescence and causing defects in nuclear morphology. AIMP3 specifically mediates degradation of mature Lamin A (LmnA), a major component of the nuclear envelope matrix; however, the mechanism of how AIMP3 interacts with LmnA is unclear. Here we report solution-phase hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) for AIMP3, LmnA, and AIMP3 in association with the LmnA C-terminus. Reversed-phase LC coupled with LTQ 14.5 T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) results in high mass accuracy and resolving power for comparing the D-uptake profiles for AIMP3, LmnA, and their complex. The results show that the AIMP3-LmnA interaction involves one of the two putative binding sites and an adjacent novel interface on AIMP3. LmnA binds AIMP3 via its extreme C-terminus. Together these findings provide a structural insight for understanding the interaction between AIMP3 and LmnA in AIMP3 degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2744624764,"Ascension to the oviduct is necessary for Chlamydia to induce tubal infertility. Using the Chlamydia muridarum induction of hydrosalpinx mouse model, we have demonstrated a significant role of the uterotubal junction in preventing chlamydial ascending infection. First, delivery of C. muridarum to either side of the uterotubal junction resulted in significant reduction in live organisms from the tissues on the opposite sides. However, the recovery yields remained similar among different sections of the uterine horn. These observations suggest that the uterotubal junction may function as a barrier between the uterine horn and oviduct. Second, deficiency in innate immunity signaling pathways mediated by either MyD88 or STING significantly compromised the uterotubal junction barrier function, permitting C. muridarum to spread freely between uterine horn and oviduct. Finally, transcervical inoculation of C. muridarum led to significantly higher incidence of bilateral hydrosalpinges in the STING-deficient mice while the same inoculation mainly induced unilateral hydrosalpinx in the wild type mice, suggesting that the STING pathway-dependent uterotubal junction plays a significant role in preventing tubal pathology. Thus, we have demonstrated for the first time that the uterotubal junction is a functional barrier for preventing tubal infection by a sexually transmitted agent, providing the first in vivo evidence for detecting chlamydial infection by the STING pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2742333351,"In multiple sclerosis (MS) the sensitivity for detection of contrast enhancing lesions (CEL) in T1-weighted scans is essential for diagnostics and therapy decisions. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the sensitivity of T1w MPRAGE scans in comparison to T1w dark blood technique (T1-DB) for CEL in MS.3T MR imaging was performed in 37 MS patients, including T2-weighted imaging, T1w MPRAGE before and after gadolinium injection (unenhanced-T1 and T1-CE) and T1-DB imaging. After gadolinium application, the T1-DB scan was performed prior to T1-CE. From unenhanced-T1 and T1-CE scans, subtraction images (T1-SUB) were calculated. The number of CEL was determined separately on T1-CE and T1-DB by two raters independently. Lesions only detected on T1-DB scans then were verified on T1-SUB. Only lesions detected by both raters were included in further analysis.In 16 patients, at least one CEL was detected by both rater, either on T1-CE or T1-DB. All lesions that were detected on T1-CE were also detected on T1-DB images. The total number of contrast enhancing lesions detected on T1-DB images (n = 54) by both raters was significantly higher than the corresponding number of lesions identified on T1-CE (n = 27) (p = 0.01); all of these lesions could be verified on SUB images. In 21 patients, no CEL was detected in any of the sequences.The application of T1-DB technique increases the sensitivity for CEL in MS, especially for those lesions that show only subtle increase in intensity after Gadolinium application but remain hypo- or iso-intense to surrounding tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2745199361,"Background In Myanmar, over five million people are infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Hepatitis has been a recent focus with the development of a National Strategic Plan on Hepatitis and plans to subsidize HCV treatment. Methods During a two-day national liver disease symposium covering HCV, HBV, hepatocellular (HCC), and end-stage liver disease (ESLD), physician surveys were administered using the automated response system (ARS) to assess physician knowledge, perceptions of barriers to screening and treatment, and proposed solutions. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratio (OR) relating demography and practice factors with higher provider knowledge and improvement. Results One hundred two physicians attending from various specialty areas (31.0% specializing in gastroenterology/hepatology and/or infectious disease) were of mixed gender (46.8% male), were younger than or equal to 40 years old (51.1% 20 to 40 years), had less experience (61.6% with ≤10 years of medical practice), were from the metropolitan area of Yangon (72.1%), and saw <10 liver disease patients per week (74.3%). The majority of physicians were not comfortable with treating or managing patients with liver disease. The post-test scores demonstrated an improvement in liver disease knowledge (9.0% ± 27.0) compared to the baseline pre-test scores; no variables were associated with significant improvement in hepatitis knowledge. Physicians identified the cost of diagnostic blood tests and treatment as the most significant barrier to treatment. Top solutions proposed were universal screening policies (46%), removal of financial barriers for treatment (29%), patient education (14%) and provider education (11%). Conclusions Physician knowledge improved after this symposium, and many other needs were revealed by the physician input on barriers to care and their solutions. These survey results are important in guiding the next steps to improve liver disease management and future medical education efforts in Myanmar."
https://openalex.org/W2743093293,"Complex networks are often organized in groups or communities of agents that share the same features and/or functions, and this structural organization is built naturally with the formation of the system. In social networks, we argue that the dynamic of linguistic interactions of agreement among people can be a crucial factor in generating this community structure, given that sharing opinions with another person bounds them together, and disagreeing constantly would probably weaken the relationship. We present here a computational model of opinion exchange that uncovers the community structure of a network. Our aim is not to present a new community detection method proper, but to show how a model of social communication dynamics can reveal the (simple and overlapping) community structure in an emergent way. Our model is based on a standard Naming Game, but takes into consideration three social features: trust, uncertainty and opinion preference, that are built over time as agents communicate among themselves. We show that the separate addition of each social feature in the Naming Game results in gradual improvements with respect to community detection. In addition, the resulting uncertainty and trust values classify nodes and edges according to role and position in the network. Also, our model has shown a degree of accuracy both for non-overlapping and overlapping communities that are comparable with most algorithms specifically designed for topological community detection."
https://openalex.org/W2743420131,"Understanding of phenotypes and their genetic basis is a major focus in current plant biology. Large amounts of phenotype data are being generated, both for macroscopic phenotypes such as size or yield, and for molecular phenotypes such as expression levels and metabolite levels. More insight in the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms that influence phenotypes will enable a better understanding of how various phenotypes are related to each other. This will be a major step forward in understanding plant biology, with immediate value for plant breeding and academic plant research. Currently the genetic basis of most phenotypes remains however to be discovered, and the relatedness of different traits is unclear. We here present a novel approach to connect phenotypes to underlying biological processes and molecular functions. These connections define similarities between different types of phenotypes. The approach starts by using Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) data, which are abundantly available for many phenotypes of interest. Overrepresentation analysis of gene functions based on Gene Ontology term enrichment across multiple QTL regions for a given phenotype, be it macroscopic or molecular, results in a small set of biological processes and molecular functions for each phenotype. Subsequently, similarity between different phenotypes can be defined in terms of these gene functions. Using publicly available rice data as example, a close relationship with defined molecular phenotypes is demonstrated for many macroscopic phenotypes. This includes for example a link between 'leaf senescence' and 'aspartic acid', as well as between 'days to maturity' and 'choline'. Relationships between macroscopic and molecular phenotypes may result in more efficient marker-assisted breeding and are likely to direct future research aimed at a better understanding of plant phenotypes."
