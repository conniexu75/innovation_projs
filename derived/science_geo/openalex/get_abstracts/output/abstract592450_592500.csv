Using a novel model of cortical event dynamics, we investigate how cortical structures generate event representations during narrative perception and how these events are stored to and retrieved from memory. Our data-driven approach allows us to detect event boundaries as shifts between stable patterns of brain activity without relying on stimulus annotations and reveals a nested hierarchy from short events in sensory regions to long events in high-order areas (including angular gyrus and posterior medial cortex), which represent abstract, multimodal situation models. High-order event boundaries are coupled to increases in hippocampal activity, which predict pattern reinstatement during later free recall. These areas also show evidence of anticipatory reinstatement as subjects listen to a familiar narrative.

Based on these results, we propose that brain activity is naturally structured into nested events, which form the basis of long-term memory representations. Typically, perception and memory are studied in the context of discrete pictures or words. Real-life experience, however, consists of a continuous stream of perceptual stimuli. The brain therefore needs to structure experience into units that can be understood and remembered: “the meaningful segments of one’s life, the coherent units of one’s personal history” (Beal and Weiss, 2013Beal D.J. Weiss H.M. The Episodic Structure of Life at Work.in: Bakker A.B. Daniels K. A Day in the Life of a Happy Worker. Psychology Press, 2013: 8-24Google Scholar). Although this question was first investigated decades ago (Newtson et al., 1977Newtson D. Engquist G.A. Bois J. The objective basis of behavior units.Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. 1977; 35: 847-862Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar), a general “event segmentation theory” was proposed only recently (Zacks et al., 2007Zacks J.M.

These and other authors have argued that humans implicitly generate event boundaries when consecutive stimuli have distinct temporal associations (Schapiro et al., 2013Schapiro A.C. Rogers T.T.

Temporal binding within and across events.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2016; 134: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). At what timescale are experiences segmented into events? When reading a story, we could chunk it into discrete units of individual words, sentences, paragraphs, or chapters, and we may need to chunk information on different timescales depending on our goals. Behavioral studies have shown that subjects can segment events into a nested hierarchy from coarse to fine timescales (Kurby and Zacks, 2008Kurby C.A. Zacks J.M.

Attribution and the unit of perception of ongoing behavior.Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. 1973; 28: 28-38Crossref Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The neural basis of this segmentation behavior is unclear; event perception could rely on a single unified system, which segments the continuous perceptual stream at different granularities depending on the current task (Zacks et al., 2007Zacks J.M. Speer N.K. Swallow K.M. Braver T.S. Reynolds J.R. Event perception: a mind-brain perspective.Psychol. Bull. 2007; 133: 273-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), or may rely on multiple brain areas that segment events at different timescales, as suggested by the selective deficits for coarse segmentations exhibited by some patient populations (Zalla et al., 2003Zalla T.

A recent theory of cortical process-memory topography argues that information is integrated at different timescales throughout the cortex. Processing timescales increase from tens of milliseconds in early sensory regions (e.g., for detecting phonemes in early auditory areas), to a few seconds in mid-level sensory areas (e.g., for integrating words into sentences), up to hundreds of seconds in regions including the temporoparietal junction, angular gyrus, and posterior and frontal medial cortex (e.g., for integrating information from entire paragraphs) (Chen et al., 2016Chen J. Honey C.J. Simony E. Arcaro M.J. Norman K.A. Hasson U. Accessing Real-Life Episodic Information from Minutes versus Hours Earlier Modulates Hippocampal and High-Order Cortical Dynamics.Cereb.

Hierarchical process memory: memory as an integral component of information processing.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2015; 19: 304-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The relationship between the process-memory topography and event segmentation has not yet been investigated. On the one hand, it is possible that cortical representations are accumulated continuously, e.g., using a sliding window approach, at each level of the processing hierarchy (Stephens et al., 2013Stephens G.J. Honey C.J. Hasson U. A place for time: the spatiotemporal structure of neural dynamics during natural audition.J. Neurophysiol. 2013; 110: 2019-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a strong link between the timescale hierarchy and event segmentation theory would predict that each area chunks experience at its preferred timescale and integrates information within discretized units (e.g., phonemes, words, sentences, paragraphs) before providing its output to the next processing level (Nelson et al., 2017Nelson M.J. El Karoui I. Giber K. Yang X. Cohen L. Koopman H. Cash S.S. Naccache L. Hale J.T. Pallier C. Dehaene S. Neurophysiological dynamics of phrase-structure building during sentence processing.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114: E3669-E3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In this view, “events” in low-level sensory cortex (e.g., a single phoneme; Giraud and Poeppel, 2012Giraud A.-L. Poeppel D. Cortical oscillations and speech processing: emerging computational principles and operations.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar) are gradually integrated into minutes-long situation-level events, using a multi-stage nested temporal chunking. This chunking of continuous experience at multiple timescales along the cortical processing hierarchy has not been previously demonstrated in the dynamics of whole-brain neural activity. A second critical question for understanding event perception is how real-life experiences are encoded into long-term memory. Behavioral experiments and mathematical models have argued that long-term memory reflects event structure during encoding (Ezzyat and Davachi, 2011Ezzyat Y. Davachi L.

However, given a continuous stream of information in a real-life context, it is not clear at what timescale memories should be encoded and whether these memory traces should be continuously updated or encoded only after an event has completed. The hippocampus is connected to long-timescale regions, including the angular gyrus and posterior medial cortex (Kravitz et al., 2011Kravitz D.J. Saleem K.S. Baker C.I. Mishkin M.

Cogn. Sci. 2011; 2: 608-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recent work has shown that hippocampal activity peaks at the offset of video clips (Ben-Yakov and Dudai, 2011Ben-Yakov A.

Hippocampal immediate poststimulus activity in the encoding of consecutive naturalistic episodes.J. Exp. Psychol. Gen. 2013; 142: 1255-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting that the end of a long-timescale event triggers memory encoding processes that occur after the event has ended. Based on our experiments (described below), we propose that the full life cycle of an event can be described in a unified theory, illustrated in Figure 1. During perception, each brain region along the processing hierarchy segments information at its preferred timescale, beginning with short events in primary visual and auditory cortex and building to multimodal situation models in long-timescale areas, including the angular gyrus and posterior medial cortex. This model of processing requires that (1) all regions driven by audio-visual stimuli should exhibit event-structured activity, with segmentation into short events in early sensory areas and longer events in high-order areas; (2) events throughout the hierarchy should have a nested structure, with coarse event boundaries annotated by human observers most strongly related to long events at the top of the hierarchy; and (3) event representations in long-timescale regions, which build a coarse model of the situation, should be invariant across different descriptions of the same situation (e.g., when the same situation is described visually in a movie or a verbally in a story). We also argue that event structure is reflected in how experiences are stored into episodic memory. At event boundaries in long-timescale areas, the situation model is transmitted to the hippocampus, which can later reinstate the situation model in long-timescale regions during recall. This implies that (4) the end of an event in long-timescale cortical regions should trigger the hippocampus to encode information about the just-concluded event into episodic memory, and (5) stored event memories can be reinstated in long-timescale cortical regions during recall, with stronger reinstatement for more strongly encoded events. Finally, this process can come full circle, with prior event memories influencing ongoing processing, such that (6) prior memory for a narrative should lead to anticipatory reinstatement in long-timescale regions. To test these hypotheses, we need the ability to identify how different brain areas segment events (at different timescales), align events across different datasets with different timings (e.g., to see whether the same situation model is being elicited by a movie versus a verbal narrative, or a movie versus recall), and track differences in event segmentations in different observers of the same stimulus (e.g., depending on prior experience). Thus, to search for the neural correlates of event segmentation, we have developed a new data-driven method that allows us to identify events directly from fMRI activity patterns across multiple timescales and datasets (Figure 2). Our analysis approach (described in detail in STAR Methods) starts with two simple assumptions: that while processing a narrative stimulus, observers progress through a sequence of discrete event representations (hidden states), and that each event has a distinct (observable) signature (a multi-voxel fMRI pattern) that is present throughout the event. We implement these assumptions using a data-driven event segmentation model, based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Fitting the model to fMRI data (e.g., evoked by viewing a movie) entails estimating the optimal number of events, the mean activity pattern for each event, and when event transitions occur. When applying the model to multiple datasets evoked by the same narrative (e.g., during movie viewing and during later verbal recall), the model is constrained to find the same sequence of patterns (because the events are the same), but the timing of the transitions between the patterns can vary (e.g., since the spoken description of the events might not take as long as the original events). In prior studies, using human-based segmentation of coarse event structure, we demonstrated that event-related representations generalize across modalities and between encoding and recall (thereby supporting hypotheses 3 and 5, Chen et al., 2017Chen J. Leong Y.C. Honey C.J. Yong C.H. Norman K.A. Hasson U. Shared memories reveal shared structure in neural activity across individuals.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, Zadbood et al., 2016Zadbood A. Chen J. Leong Y.C. Norman K.A. Hasson U. How we transmit memories to other brains: constructing shared neural representations via communication.bioRxiv. 2016; https://doi.org/10.1101/081208Crossref Google Scholar). In the current study, we extend these findings by testing whether we can use the data-driven HMM to detect stable and abstract event boundaries in high-order areas without relying on human annotations. This new analysis approach also allows us to test for the first time whether the brain segments information, hierarchically, at multiple timescales (hypotheses 1 and 2); how segmentation of information interacts with the storage and retrieval of this information by the hippocampus (hypothesis 4); and how prior exposure to a sequence of events can later lead to anticipatory reinstatement of those events (hypothesis 6). Taken together, our results provide the first direct evidence that realistic experiences are discretely and hierarchically chunked at multiple timescales in the brain, with chunks at the top of the processing hierarchy playing a special role in cross-modal situation representation and episodic memory. All of our analyses are carried out using our new HMM-based event segmentation model (summarized above, and described in detail in the Event Segmentation Model subsection in STAR Methods), which can automatically discover the fMRI signatures of each event and its temporal boundaries in a particular dataset. We validated this model using both synthetic data (Figure S1) and narrative data with clear event breaks between stories (Figure S2), confirming that we could accurately recover the number of event boundaries and their locations (see STAR Methods). We then applied the model to test six predictions of our theory of event perception and memory. We first tested the hypothesis that all regions driven by audio-visual stimuli should exhibit event-structured activity, with segmentation into short events in early sensory areas and longer events in high-order areas. We measured the extent to which continuous stimuli evoked the event structure hypothesized by our model (periods with stable event patterns punctuated by shifts between events) and whether the timescales of these events varied along the cortical hierarchy. We tested the model by fitting it to fMRI data collected while subjects watched a 50-min movie (Chen et al., 2017Chen J. Leong Y.C. Honey C.J. Yong C.H. Norman K.A. Hasson U. Shared memories reveal shared structure in neural activity across individuals.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and then assessing how well the learned event structure explained the activity patterns of a held-out subject. Note that previous analyses of this dataset have shown that the evoked activity is similar across subjects, justifying an across-subjects design (Chen et al., 2017Chen J. Leong Y.C. Honey C.J. Yong C.H. Norman K.A. Hasson U. Shared memories reveal shared structure in neural activity across individuals.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We found that essentially all brain regions that responded consistently to the movie (across subjects) showed evidence for event-like structure, and that the optimal number of events varied across the cortex (Figure 3). Sensory regions like visual and auditory cortex showed faster transitions between stable activity patterns, while higher-level regions like the posterior medial cortex, angular gyrus, and intraparietal sulcus had activity patterns that often remained constant for over a minute before transitioning to a new stable pattern (see Figure 3 insets and Figure S3). This topography of event timescales is broadly consistent with that found in previous work (Hasson et al., 2015Hasson U. Chen J. Honey C.J. Hierarchical process memory: memory as an integral component of information processing.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2015; 19: 304-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) measuring sensitivity to temporal scrambling of a movie stimulus (see Figure S8). The second implication of our theory is that events throughout the hierarchy should have a nested structure, with coarse event boundaries annotated by human observers most strongly related to long events at the top of the hierarchy. To examine how event boundaries changed throughout the cortical hierarchy, we created four regions of interest, each with 300 voxels, centered on ROIs from prior work (see STAR Methods): early visual cortex, late visual cortex, angular gyrus, and posterior medial cortex. We identified the optimal timescale for each region as in the previous analysis and then fit the event segmentation model at this optimal timescale, as illustrated in Figure 4A. We found that a significant portion of the boundaries in a given layer were also present in lower layers (Figure 4B), especially for adjacent layers in the hierarchy. This suggests that event segmentation is at least partially hierarchical, with finer event boundaries nested within coarser boundaries. We asked four independent raters to divide the movie into “scenes” based on major shifts in the narrative (such as in location, topic, or time). The number of event boundaries identified by the observers varied between 36 and 64, but the boundaries had a significant amount of overlap, with an average pairwise Dice’s coefficient of 0.63 and 20 event boundaries that were labeled by all four raters. We constructed a “consensus” annotation containing boundaries marked by at least two raters, which split the narrative into 54 events, similar to the mean timescale for individual annotators (49.5).We then measured, for each region, what fraction of its fMRI-defined boundaries were close to (within three time points of) a consensus event boundary. As shown in Figure 4C, all regions showed an above-chance match to human annotations (early visual, p = 0.0135; late visual, p = 0.0065; angular gyrus, p = 0.0011; posterior medial, p < 0.001), but this match increased across the layers of the hierarchy and was largest in angular gyrus and posterior medial cortex (angular gyrus > early visual, p = 0.0580; posterior medial > early visual, p = 0.033). The third requirement of our theory is that activity patterns in long-timescale regions should be invariant across different descriptions of the same situation. This hypothesis is based on a prior study (Zadbood et al., 2016Zadbood A. Chen J. Leong Y.C. Norman K.A. Hasson U. How we transmit memories to other brains: constructing shared neural representations via communication.bioRxiv. 2016; https://doi.org/10.1101/081208Crossref Google Scholar) in which one group of subjects watched a 24-min movie while the other group listened to an 18-min audio narration describing the events that occurred in the movie. The prior study used a hand-labeled event correspondence between these two stimuli to show that activity patterns evoked by corresponding events in the movie and narration were correlated in a network of regions including angular gyrus, precuneus, retrosplenial cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and mPFC (Zadbood et al., 2016Zadbood A. Chen J. Leong Y.C. Norman K.A. Hasson U. How we transmit memories to other brains: constructing shared neural representations via communication.bioRxiv. 2016; https://doi.org/10.1101/081208Crossref Google Scholar). Here, we use this dataset to ask whether our event segmentation model can replicate these results in a purely unsupervised manner, without using any prior event labeling. For each cortical searchlight, we first segmented the movie data into events and then tested whether this same sequence of events from the movie-watching subjects was present in the audio-narration subjects. Regions including the angular gyrus, temporoparietal junction, posterior medial cortex, and inferior frontal cortex showed a strongly significant correspondence between the two modalities (Figure 5), indicating that a similar sequence of event patterns was evoked by the movie and audio narration irrespective of the modality used to describe the events. In contrast, though low-level auditory cortex was reliably activated by both of these stimuli, there was no above-chance similarity between the series of activity patterns evoked by the two stimuli (movie versus verbal description), presumably because the low-level auditory features of the two stimuli were markedly different. We tested a fourth hypothesis from our theory, that the end of an event in long-timescale cortical regions should trigger the hippocampus to encode information about the just-concluded event into episodic memory. Prior work has shown that the end of a video clip is associated with increased hippocampal activity, and the magnitude of the activity predicts later memory (Ben-Yakov and Dudai, 2011Ben-Yakov A. Dudai Y. Constructing realistic engrams: poststimulus activity of hippocampus and dorsal striatum predicts subsequent episodic memory.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 9032-9042Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, Ben-Yakov et al., 2013Ben-Yakov A. Eshel N. Dudai Y. Hippocampal immediate poststimulus activity in the encoding of consecutive naturalistic episodes.J. Exp. Psychol. Gen. 2013; 142: 1255-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These experiments, however, have used only isolated short video clips with clear transitions between events. Do neurally defined event boundaries in a continuous movie, evoked by subtler transitions between related scenes, generate the same kind of hippocampal signature? Using a searchlight procedure, we identified event boundaries with the HMM segmentation model for each cortical area across the timescale hierarchy, using the 50-min movie dataset (Chen et al., 2017Chen J. Leong Y.C. Honey C.J. Yong C.H. Norman K.A. Hasson U. Shared memories reveal shared structure in neural activity across individuals.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We then computed the average hippocampal activity around the event boundaries of each cortical area to determine whether a cortical boundary tended to trigger a hippocampal response. We found that event boundaries in a distributed set of regions including angular gyrus, posterior medial cortex, and parahippocampal cortex all showed a strong relationship to hippocampal activity, with the hippocampal response typically peaking within several time points after the event boundary (Figure 6). This network of regions closely overlaps with the posterior medial memory system (Ranganath and Ritchey, 2012Ranganath C. Ritchey M. Two cortical systems for memory-guided behaviour.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Note that both the event boundaries and the hippocampal response are hemodynamic signals, so there is no hemodynamic offset between these two measures. The hippocampal response does start slightly before the event boundary, which could be due to uncertainty in"

L. reuteri did not shape the DP-IEL-TCR (TCR, T cell receptor) repertoire but generated indole derivatives of tryptophan that activated the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor in CD4+ T cells, allowing Thpok down-regulation and differentiation into DP IELs. Thus, L. reuteri, together with a tryptophan-rich diet, can reprogram intraepithelial CD4+ T cells into immunoregulatory T cells."

Steed et al. found that a microbial product, desaminotyrosine (DAT), produced by an obligate clostridial anaerobe from the digestion of plant flavonoids, is beneficial during influenza. DAT enters the bloodstream and triggers type I interferon signaling, which then augments antiviral responses by phagocytic cells. Without DAT, influenza virus causes inflammation and severe disease.

Chen et al. leveraged this technique to produce semiconducting blocks of polyacetylene in an insulating precursor. Ring-opening metathesis polymerization tethered together a series of fused four-carbon rings, reminiscent of the unusual ladderane membrane lipids of anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria. Subsequently, sonication unzipped these strained rings into alternating C=C double bonds, thereby extending π-conjugation along the polymer backbone. Science , this issue p. 475"

However, extreme events, such as heat waves or cold snaps, can produce rapid changes, both morphologically and genetically. Campbell-Staton et al. studied a population of green anole lizards during an extreme cold snap in the southern United States (see the Perspective by Grant). After the cold snap, the lizards showed greater cold resistance and displayed changes in six genomic regions that are important for regulation of function in the cold. Understanding how extreme climatic events influence adaptive potential will become increasingly important as the climate becomes more volatile. Science , this issue p. 495 ; see also p. 451"

Here we report a new function of Munc13, independent of Munc18: it promotes the proper syntaxin/synaptobrevin subconfiguration during assembly of the ternary SNARE complex. In cooperation with Munc18, Munc13 additionally ensures the proper syntaxin/SNAP-25 subconfiguration. In a reconstituted fusion assay with SNAREs, complexin, and synaptotagmin, inclusion of both Munc13 and Munc18 quadruples the Ca2+-triggered amplitude and achieves Ca2+ sensitivity at near-physiological concentrations. In Munc13-1/2 double-knockout neurons, expression of a constitutively open mutant of syntaxin could only minimally restore neurotransmitter release relative to Munc13-1 rescue. Together, the physiological functions of Munc13 may be related to regulation of proper SNARE complex assembly."

We test if the earliest upland maize was adapted for early flowering, a characteristic of modern temperate maize. We sequenced fifteen 1900-year-old maize cobs from Turkey Pen Shelter in the temperate Southwest. Indirectly validated genomic models predicted that Turkey Pen maize was marginally adapted with respect to flowering, as well as short, tillering, and segregating for yellow kernel color. Temperate adaptation drove modern population differentiation and was selected in situ from ancient standing variation. Validated prediction of polygenic traits improves our understanding of ancient phenotypes and the dynamics of environmental adaptation."

Pol II combines with several other factors to form an elongation complex that promotes transcription elongation. Ehara et al. determined the high-resolution structure of the elongation complex by means of x-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (see the Perspective by Fouqueau and Werner). Multiple elongation factors are distributed on a wide surface of Pol II and establish an RNA exit path and DNA entry or exit tunnels, which facilitate nascent transcript transfer and DNA unwinding or rewinding. The Pol II elongation complex thus adopts a stable architecture suitable for processive transcription. Science , this issue p. 921 ; see also p. 871"

How such “orphans” are recognized and tagged for degradation is poorly understood. Two papers identify a protein quality-control pathway that acts on some of the most abundant protein complexes in the human body: hemoglobin and ribosomes (see the Perspective by Hampton and Dargemont). Yanagitani et al. show that the central player in this process is an unusual enzyme (UBE2O) that recognizes substrates and tags them for destruction. Other quality-contr ol pathways tend to use separate factors for target selection (often a chaperone), ubiquitin donation (an E2), and ubiquitin conjugati on (an E3). Encoding all three activities in a single factor whose function can be reconstituted in a purified system provides a tractable route to detailed mechanistic and structural dissection.

The hippocampal CA3 region is essential for encoding, storage, and recall of declarative memory (Rolls, 2007Rolls E.T. An attractor network in the hippocampus: theory and neurophysiology.Learn.

CA3 is distinct within the hippocampus as it is the only region with strong recurrent excitatory collateral connections capable of forming an autoassociative network. Such connectivity has provided the foundation for numerous theoretical studies of hippocampal-based associative memory storage and pattern completion, the process by which an entire memory is retrieved from partial cues (McNaughton and Morris, 1987McNaughton B.L.

Schlögl A. Frotscher M. Jonas P. Synaptic mechanisms of pattern completion in the hippocampal CA3 network.Science. 2016; 353: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Indeed, one of the first in vivo intracellular recording studies found that stimulation of the recurrent collaterals produced a net inhibitory response in CA3 PNs (Spencer and Kandel, 1961Spencer W.A.

Surprisingly, there have been few studies to date that assess I/E balance in the CA3 recurrent network. A second important question about the role of CA3 in memory storage and recall arises from its known heterogeneity along the transverse (or proximodistal) axis. To date, the majority of experimental studies and computational models have treated CA3 as a single homogeneous entity (Denny et al., 2014Denny C.A. Kheirbek M.A. Alba E.L. Tanaka K.F. Brachman R.A.

Proximal CA3 or CA3c lies closest to DG, whereas distal CA3 or CA3a lies closest to CA2, with mid-CA3 or CA3b interposed. More recent studies demonstrate marked proximodistal heterogeneity in CA3 PN dendritic morphology, axonal projections, and gene expression patterns (Ishizuka et al., 1995Ishizuka N. Cowan W.M.

For example, many genes highly enriched in proximal CA3 are nearly absent in distal CA3, and vice versa, a phenomenon that is less pronounced in CA1 (Cembrowski et al., 2016Cembrowski M.S.

Important differences have also been reported for the behavioral role of the CA3 subregions. Animals with lesions restricted to proximal CA3 show greater deficits in processing spatial information than those with lesions in distal CA3 (Hunsaker et al., 2008Hunsaker M.R. Rosenberg J.S. Kesner R.P. The role of the dentate gyrus, CA3a,b, and CA3c for detecting spatial and environmental novelty.Hippocampus. 2008; 18: 1064-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Additionally, proximal CA3 is more strongly activated during a nonspatial delayed nonmatch-to-sample recognition memory task than distal CA3 (Nakamura et al., 2013Nakamura N.H. Flasbeck V. Maingret N. Kitsukawa T. Sauvage M.M. Proximodistal segregation of nonspatial information in CA3: preferential recruitment of a proximal CA3-distal CA1 network in nonspatial recognition memory.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 11506-11514Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Imaging of immediate-early gene Arc expression revealed a proximodistal gradient of activation during pattern separation, with proximal CA3 showing the greatest sensitivity to different environments and distal CA3 the least (Marrone et al., 2014Marrone D.F. Satvat E. Odintsova I.V. Gheidi A. Dissociation of spatial representations within hippocampal region CA3.Hippocampus. 2014; 24: 1417-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, a proximodistal gradient of increasing reactivation of CA3 during retrieval of fear memory has recently been reported based on c-fos-driven transgene expression (Nakazawa et al., 2016Nakazawa Y. Pevzner A. Tanaka K.Z. Wiltgen B.J. Memory retrieval along the proximodistal axis of CA1.Hippocampus. 2016; 26: 1140-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with a functional gradient of place cell properties along the proximodistal axis, with distal CA3 more strongly involved in pattern completion and proximal CA3 more strongly involved in pattern separation (Lee et al., 2015Lee H. Wang C. Deshmukh S.S. Knierim J.J.

What cellular and circuit mechanisms may contribute to the proximodistal heterogeneity in CA3 function during spatial encoding, memory storage, and recall? How is proximal CA3 tuned to perform pattern separation, whereas distal CA3 is tuned for pattern completion? Here we systematically characterize the intrinsic membrane excitability properties, synaptic connectivity, and I/E balance of recurrent connectivity along the CA3 proximodistal axis in mouse dorsal hippocampus. We then relate these properties to proximodistal heterogeneity in neuronal reactivation during fear memory recall using a genetic Arc-based imaging approach (Denny et al., 2014Denny C.A. Kheirbek M.A. Alba E.L. Tanaka K.F. Brachman R.A. Laughman K.B. Tomm N.K. Turi G.F. Losonczy A. Hen R.

Köhler S. Frankland P.W. Finding the engram.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2015; 16: 521-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). To investigate potential physiological mechanisms that may contribute to the role of the different CA3 subregions in learning and memory and spatial encoding, we examined the intrinsic electrophysiological properties, dendritic morphology, and synaptic connectivity of pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the three CA3 subregions in dorsal hippocampus (Figures 1A and 1D–1F). For a subset of recorded PNs, we performed biocytin-based staining, which enabled us to determine the relative location of the recorded neurons along the transverse axis, with 0 assigned to the most proximal region of CA3 and 1 assigned to the end of mossy fibers (MF) near the CA2/CA3 border (Figures 1A and 1D–1F). We also examined the properties of CA2 PNs to determine their relationship to CA3. Because CA2 and CA3a PNs are intermingled at the border region, we only included CA3a and CA2 PNs that were visualized using biocytin morphological reconstruction to determine the presence or absence, respectively, of thorny excrescences, a hallmark of CA3 PNs (e.g., Figures 1D, 4B, and 4C). Dendritic structures of CA3/CA2 PNs across the transverse axis have been examined in detail in a previous study from rat hippocampus (Ishizuka et al., 1995Ishizuka N. Cowan W.M. Amaral D.G. A quantitative analysis of the dendritic organization of pyramidal cells in the rat hippocampus.J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 362: 17-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Here we reexamined the dendritic morphology of CA3/CA2 PNs along the transverse axis from mouse dorsal hippocampus. We filled the neurons with biocytin during whole-cell recordings, performed morphological reconstructions using Neurolucida, and conducted morphometric analyses. Some of the data from CA1 and CA2 PNs presented here have been reported in our previous paper (Sun et al., 2014Sun Q. Srinivas K.V. Sotayo A. Siegelbaum S.A. Dendritic Na(+) spikes enable cortical input to drive action potential output from hippocampal CA2 pyramidal neurons.eLife. 2014; 3: 3Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We found CA3c has the shortest total dendritic length across the subregions (Figures S1A and S1B). The difference is particularly evident for dendrites in stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM), where the axonal projections from layer II entorhinal cortex (EC) stellate cells terminate. The dendritic length of CA2 PNs in SLM was the greatest, followed by CA3a and CA3b (Figures S1A and S1B). A Sholl analysis revealed that CA3a, CA3b, and CA2 PNs had more dendritic intersections in SLM (250–450 μm from the soma) than CA3c and CA1 (Figure S1C). Indeed, CA3c had very few dendritic branches that extend into SLM. At the basal dendrites, CA3a and CA3b had the greatest number of dendritic intersections (Figure S1C), consistent with their long basal dendrites. Together, our data revealed a pronounced proximodistal heterogeneity of dendritic structures from CA3c to CA2, consistent with previous results on rat hippocampus (Ishizuka et al., 1995Ishizuka N. Cowan W.M. Amaral D.G. A quantitative analysis of the dendritic organization of pyramidal cells in the rat hippocampus.J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 362: 17-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Next we examined the intrinsic membrane properties along the proximodistal axis. There was a small but statistically significant continuous proximodistal gradient in resting potential, with the most negative resting potential in CA3c, followed by CA3b, CA3a, and CA2 (Figures 1B and 1C). Further, the resting potential of individual cells was linearly correlated with their proximodistal location, indicating a gradual change (Figure 1B). Next we assessed intrinsic membrane excitability by injecting a series of 1-s-long depolarizing current pulses, with the membrane potential held initially at −72 mV for all regions (Figures 1G and 1H). The spike frequency versus stimulating current (F-I) curve showed that CA3c was the most excitable subregion—firing the greatest number of APs in response to a given current pulse—followed by CA3b, with CA2 being the least excitable subregion (Figures 1G and 1H). However, the firing pattern of CA2 PNs in response to a strong current injection (>0.8 nA) was distinct, as CA2 PNs fired more APs than CA3a or CA3b (Figures 1G and 1H). Because of the proximodistal gradient of resting potential (Figures 1B and 1C), we also examined the F-I curve at the resting potential of each cell to provide a more physiologically realistic assessment. We found a similar gradient of excitability (Figure S2), indicating a likely difference in excitability in vivo (Kowalski et al., 2016Kowalski J. Gan J. Jonas P. Pernía-Andrade A.J. Intrinsic membrane properties determine hippocampal differential firing pattern in vivo in anesthetized rats.Hippocampus. 2016; 26: 668-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, Turner et al., 1995Turner D.A. Li X.G. Pyapali G.K. Ylinen A. Buzsaki G. Morphometric and electrical properties of reconstructed hippocampal CA3 neurons recorded in vivo.J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 356: 580-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, despite its more negative resting potential, CA3c is the most excitable subregion (Figure S2). We also plotted the AP frequency (600 pA current injection) against the normalized proximodistal cell location and observed a linear relationship (Figure 1I, Figure S2C), suggesting a gradual, rather than abrupt, change of intrinsic membrane excitability across the transverse axis. What is the mechanism for the differences in excitability? We found no significant difference in voltage threshold or action potential (AP) amplitude among the various subregions (Figure S3). Rather, we observed a profound gradient in input resistance across the subregions (Figures 1J–1L). CA3c exhibited the highest input resistance, followed by CA3b, CA3a, and then CA2 (Figures 1J–1L), with the input resistance of CA3c PNs being 5.8-fold greater than CA2 and 2.6-fold greater than CA3a (Figure 1K). Furthermore, there was a linear relationship of input resistance of individual cells with their proximodistal location (Figure 1L), indicating a gradual change with position. To determine whether the gradient of input resistance can account for the heterogeneity of intrinsic excitability, we plotted AP frequency (in response to 600 pA current injection) of individual cells against input resistance and observed a strong positive correlation (Figures S4A and S4B). Furthermore, by injecting increasing values of EPSC-like currents into cells, we determined that the current threshold required to evoke an AP was inversely and significantly correlated with input resistance (Figures S4C and S4D). Taken together, these results suggest that the proximodistal gradient of decreasing intrinsic excitability can be largely accounted for by the decreasing gradient of input resistance. What are the mechanisms underlying the gradient of input resistance, and is it related to the gradient of resting potential? As the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) is a key contributor to both resting membrane potential and input resistance (Robinson and Siegelbaum, 2003Robinson R.B. Siegelbaum S.A. Hyperpolarization-activated cation currents: from molecules to physiological function.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 453-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar), we reasoned that an increasing proximodistal gradient of Ih may contribute to the observed properties. To test this, we first compared sag amplitude in response to a hyperpolarizing current pulse, which provides an indirect measure of Ih, across the transverse axis. CA2 exhibited the greatest sag amplitude, followed by CA3a, with CA3c having the smallest sag (Figures 2A–2C). Moreover, there was a strong linear relationship between sag amplitude and normalized cell position (Figure 2B), in agreement with the linear gradient in input resistance and intrinsic excitability (Figures 1I and 1L). Furthermore, the input resistance of individual cells was significantly and inversely correlated with sag (Figure 2D), supporting a major impact of Ih on intrinsic properties. To directly assess the influence of Ih on intrinsic excitability, we applied ZD7288 (10 μM), a blocker of Ih, to the bath solution. This caused a significant increase in input resistance in both CA2 and CA3a, but not CA3b/c PNs (Figures 2E–2G). Consistently, AP frequency in response to constant current injection was also increased in CA2 and CA3a, but not, CA3b/c (Figures 2I–2K). Furthermore, in the presence of ZD7288 the resting membrane potential of CA2 PNs was more hyperpolarized, with a weaker effect in CA3a and no significant change in CA3b or CA3c (Figure 2H). Finally, application of ZD7288 reduced, but did not abolish, the difference in input resistance across the subregions (Figure 2F). Thus, whereas the proximodistal gradient of Ih is important, it only partially accounts for the heterogeneity of intrinsic excitability. Given the differences in dendritic length along the transverse axis, we asked whether differences in membrane area may contribute to the differences in input resistance. To estimate membrane area, we measured membrane capacitance in the presence of ZD7288. We found that CA3c had a significantly smaller capacitance than the other subregions (Figure 2L), consistent with its more compact somatodendritic structure (Figure S1). These results show that the more compact size of CA3c PNs, in combination with their lower level of Ih, can largely account for their high input resistance and thus greater intrinsic excitability to a given stimulating current. Although there is prior anatomical evidence for heterogeneity of MF input to CA3 along the proximodistal axis (Claiborne et al., 1986Claiborne B.J. Amaral D.G. Cowan W.M. A light and electron microscopic analysis of the mossy fibers of the rat dentate gyrus.J. Comp. Neurol. 1986; 246: 435-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), to our knowledge there have been no prior studies of potential functional differences in the strength of MF synaptic excitation. Here, we directly examined the functional heterogeneity of MF excitatory drive using an optogenetic approach. To specifically and uniformly activate the MF terminals across the transverse axis, we expressed ChR2 specifically in DG granule cells by crossing a POMC-Cre mouse line (which specifically targets DG granule cells in the hippocampus) with the Rosa26-CAG- STOP-floxed-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP mouse line (Figure 3) (Kheirbek et al., 2013Kheirbek M.A. Drew L.J.

We verified the functional expression of ChR2 in granule cells by demonstrating that photostimulation evoked in granule cells a large excitatory current under voltage clamp that reliably fired APs under current clamp, even during 20 Hz trains of light pulses (Figures 3D–3H, n = 4). To examine synaptic responses in pyramidal neuron targets of granule cells, we photostimulated MF terminals with a light pulse centered on the region of stratum lucidum (the site of MF inputs) containing the dendrites of a PN from which EPSCs were recorded under voltage-clamp conditions at −75 mV (near the reversal potential for the IPSC). The photostimulation reliably evoked an EPSC in both CA3 and CA2 PNs that was largely abolished by bath application of the mGluR2 agonist, DCG-IV (control: −535 ± 139 pA; DCG-IV: −60 ± 15 pA, n = 9, p = 0.006, paired t test, Figures 3I–3K). This indicates that the light-evoked current was mediated by MF inputs, which are selectively inhibited by mGluR2 activation (Kamiya et al., 1996Kamiya H. Shinozaki H. Yamamoto C. Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor type 2/3 suppresses transmission at rat hippocampal mossy fibre synapses.J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To compare the MF-mediated EPSCs across the subregions, we sequentially measured EPSCs under voltage-clamp from pairs of CA3a/CA2, CA3c/CA3a, CA3c/CA3b, or CA3c/CA2 PNs from each transverse slice (Figure 4). The EPSCs were greatest in CA3c and CA3b, and then progressively diminished across the transverse axis, with the MF EPSC in CA3a, but not CA3b, significantly smaller than the EPSC in CA3c (Figures 4E, 4F, an"

Several genetic mutations that affect neuronal protein synthesis have been linked to the development of autism and intellectual disability (ASD/ID) (Kelleher and Bear, 2008Kelleher 3rd, R.J.

Fragile X syndrome (FX), a prominent single-gene cause of ASD/ID, arises from mutations in the FMR1 gene that encodes the protein synthesis repressor fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) (Ashley et al., 1993Ashley Jr., C.T.

In hippocampal CA1, FMRP is synthesized at synapses by activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu1/5), where it acts as a negative regulator of the mRNA translation supporting long-term synaptic depression (LTD) (Bear et al., 2004Bear M.F.

USA. 1997; 94: 5395-5400Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). In the FX mouse model (Fmr1−/y), loss of FMRP leads to excessive protein synthesis downstream of mGlu1/5 activation, and consequently, mGluR-LTD is exaggerated and no longer dependent upon new protein synthesis (Huber et al., 2002Huber K.M.

According to the mGluR theory of fragile X, excessive translation underlies several neurological pathologies in FX, and numerous studies support this interpretation (Bear et al., 2004Bear M.F.

If aberrant mRNA translation is indeed a core pathophysiology, then the challenge becomes isolating and interpreting the changes in translation that result in altered function. In this study, we employed a combination of cell-type-specific translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify differentially translating mRNAs in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the Fmr1−/y hippocampus (Heiman et al., 2008Heiman M. Schaefer A. Gong S. Peterson J.D. Day M. Ramsey K.E. Suárez-Fariñas M. Schwarz C. Stephan D.A. Surmeier D.J. et al.A translational profiling approach for the molecular characterization of CNS cell types.Cell. 2008; 135: 738-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). We focused on CA1 pyramidal neurons based on work showing that excessive translation in these neurons leads to functional disruption, namely the exaggeration of mGluR-LTD in the Fmr1−/y mouse (Nosyreva and Huber, 2006Nosyreva E.D. Huber K.M. Metabotropic receptor-dependent long-term depression persists in the absence of protein synthesis in the mouse model of fragile X syndrome.J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 95: 3291-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This first cell-type-specific translation analysis identified 121 differentially translating mRNAs in Fmr1−/y CA1 neurons. Interestingly, the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) signaling pathway is the most significantly changed gene category, with the Chrm4 mRNA encoding muscarinic subtype M4 significantly overexpressed in the Fmr1−/y. Further experiments confirmed the over-translation of Chrm4 and subsequent overexpression of M4 in Fmr1−/y hippocampus. Based on these results, we examined whether inhibition of M4 could correct pathological changes in the Fmr1−/y brain. To our surprise, we find that the opposite strategy, an enhancement of M4 using the highly specific positive allosteric modulator (PAM) VU0152100, normalizes excessive protein synthesis and exaggerated mGluR-LTD in the Fmr1−/y hippocampus. Furthermore, systemic injection of VU0152100 significantly reduces the incidence of audiogenic seizures (AGS) in Fmr1−/y mice. These results suggest that not all excessively translated mRNAs in the Fmr1−/y brain are contributing to pathological changes. Instead, one of the most significantly over-translated mRNAs in Fmr1−/y CA1 neurons encodes a protein that should be positively modulated rather than inhibited to correct brain function. In Fmr1−/y CA1, excessive translation contributes to the exaggeration of mGluR-LTD (Huber et al., 2002Huber K.M. Gallagher S.M. Warren S.T. Bear M.F. Altered synaptic plasticity in a mouse model of fragile X mental retardation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 7746-7750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). To isolate differentially translating mRNAs specifically from CA1 pyramidal neurons, we used a TRAP strategy that allows for cell-type-specific isolation of translating mRNAs using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mouse lines engineered to express a GFP-tagged L10a ribosomal subunit in select cell populations (Heiman et al., 2008Heiman M.

The association of the L10a subunit with the 60S large ribosomal subunit allows for the enrichment of translating mRNAs (Heiman et al., 2008Heiman M. Schaefer A. Gong S. Peterson J.D. Day M.

Neurosci. 2016; 36: 11946-11958Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Confocal imaging of coronal brain sections from this CA1-TRAP mouse confirms an expression of GFP-L10a within both the soma and dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region (Figure 1A). Analysis of GFP-expressing (GFP+) cells isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) reveals an enrichment of the CA1 pyramidal neuron marker Wfs1 (∗p < 0.0001) and the excitatory neuron marker Camk2a (∗p = 0.0046) as compared to total hippocampal cells. In contrast, the glial marker Gfap is depleted (∗p = 0.0218; Figure 1B). This confirms that the GFP-L10a-expressing cells are indeed CA1 pyramidal neurons. To ensure that we could isolate CA1-specific translating mRNAs, we performed TRAP immunoprecipitations (IPs) from hippocampi isolated from CA1-TRAP mice using previously established protocols (Heiman et al., 2008Heiman M. Schaefer A. Gong S. Peterson J.D. Day M. Ramsey K.E. Suárez-Fariñas M. Schwarz C. Stephan D.A.

Ribosome-bound transcripts were analyzed using RNA-seq, and the identified genes were compared to previously published datasets from cerebellar Bergmann glia (BG), Purkinje cells (PCs), and granule cells (GCs) (Mellén et al., 2012Mellén M. Ayata P. Dewell S. Kriaucionis S. Heintz N.

The results of these comparisons show a significant enrichment of CA1 pyramidal neuron markers in the translating ribosome fraction (Figure 1D; Figure S1). These results confirm that mRNAs isolated in the CA1-TRAP IP originate from CA1 pyramidal neurons. To identify differentially translating mRNAs in Fmr1−/y CA1 neurons, we compared Fmr1−/y (knockout [KO]) and wild-type (WT) littermate mice, each heterozygous for the CA1-TRAP transgene. All experiments were performed with the experimenter blind to genotype. In order to confirm that changes seen in Fmr1−/y TRAP-bound mRNAs are consistent with changes seen using other methodologies, we measured the expression of Camk2a, previously shown to be over-translated in multiple studies (Darnell et al., 2011Darnell J.C.

Our results show a significant enrichment of Camk2a in the Fmr1−/y CA1-TRAP fraction (∗p = 0.0004) (Figure 1E). In contrast, total Camk2a expression is not elevated in FACS-isolated CA1 pyramidal neurons from Fmr1−/y hippocampus, suggesting that changes seen in the TRAP fraction are not due to changes in the transcription of Camk2a (Figure 1E). After verifying that the Fmr1−/y CA1-TRAP reflects previously reported changes in translation, we performed RNA-seq on six sets of Fmr1−/y and WT CA1-TRAP littermates (see STAR Methods). Hippocampi were isolated from Fmr1−/y and WT littermates at a juvenile age (postnatal days 25–32) when the exaggerated mGluR-LTD phenotype is observed (Nosyreva and Huber, 2006Nosyreva E.D.

RNA was isolated from both the TRAP fraction and the starting Input, and samples were processed for RNA-seq according to established protocols (see STAR Methods). Differential gene expression was determined using DESeq2 at the default false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1, consistent with previous studies (Cho et al., 2015Cho J. Yu N.K. Choi J.H. Sim S.E.

The majority of differentially translating transcripts are increased in the Fmr1−/y versus WT (Table S1); however, a significant number are also decreased (Table S2). In contrast to the ribosome-bound TRAP fraction, a comparison of WT and Fmr1−/y Input fractions reveals only three differentially expressed genes (Figure 1F). This is consistent with the observed increase in translation, but not transcription, seen in the Fmr1−/y hippocampus (Muddashetty et al., 2007Muddashetty R.S. Kelić S. Gross C. Xu M. Bassell G.J.

Neurosci. 2010; 30: 15616-15627Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The number of mRNA targets of FMRP is estimated to be well over 800, and it is believed that many of these are translationally repressed when bound to FMRP (Darnell et al., 2011Darnell J.C. Van Driesche S.J. Zhang C. Hung K.Y. Mele A. Fraser C.E. Stone E.F. Chen C. Fak J.J. Chi S.W. et al.FMRP stalls ribosomal translocation on mRNAs linked to synaptic function and autism.Cell. 2011; 146: 247-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how many of these mRNAs are over-translating in the Fmr1−/y brain. Our analysis of differentially translating mRNAs identified only three verified FMRP targets (Cacna1d, Arhgef17, and Pcdhgc5), and all are downregulated in the Fmr1−/y TRAP (Table S2) (Darnell et al., 2011Darnell J.C. Van Driesche S.J. Zhang C. Hung K.Y. Mele A. Fraser C.E. Stone E.F. Chen C. Fak J.J. Chi S.W. et al.FMRP stalls ribosomal translocation on mRNAs linked to synaptic function and autism.Cell. 2011; 146: 247-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar). This surprising result motivated us to investigate the global expression difference in all FMRP target mRNAs in both the Input (i.e., total hippocampal mRNA) and CA1-TRAP fractions of the Fmr1−/y hippocampus as compared to WT (Figure 2A). To do this, we compared the differential expression of FMRP target mRNAs to all genes expressed at the same level of abundance (Figure 2B). Interestingly, a cumulative distribution of FMRP targets in the differentially expressed population shows a significant shift toward downregulation (Kolmogorov-Smirnov [K-S] test ∗p = 9.23 × 10−14) (Figure 2C). The same significant shift was seen when the FMRP target list was compared to five randomly generated gene sets of the same size (Figure S2). This indicates a subtle reduction in the expression of FMRP targets in the Fmr1−/y hippocampal mRNA population when compared to WT. To examine whether the reduction in FMRP target expression was reflected in the translating ribosome fraction, we repeated this analysis using CA1-TRAP samples. The results show the same difference in the distribution of FMRP targets versus WT (K-S test ∗p = 4.86 × 10−13) (Figure 2D; Figure S2). Thus, the reduced expression of FMRP targets in the total Fmr1−/y mRNA Input is mirrored in the CA1-TRAP fraction. The conclusion from our analysis is that FMRP target mRNAs are not necessarily enriched in the translating ribosome fraction of the Fmr1−/y hippocampus at this age. One possibility suggested by our findings is that differentially translating mRNAs in the juvenile Fmr1−/y hippocampus are not necessarily reflective of a proximal loss of FMRP, but rather they represent a homeostatic shift that has developed in response to an early loss of FMRP. We thus wondered whether the differentially translating mRNAs that we identified were compensating for the downregulated FMRP targets. To investigate this, we examined whether the differentially expressed transcripts in the Fmr1−/y CA1-TRAP encoded proteins similar to those encoded by FMRP targets. To sort these transcripts by function, we used a Pfam analysis to categorize differentially expressed mRNAs and FMRP targets into protein clans (pClans) (Finn et al., 2016Finn R.D. Coggill P. Eberhardt R.Y. Eddy S.R. Mistry J. Mitchell A.L. Potter S.C. Punta M. Qureshi M. Sangrador-Vegas A. et al.The Pfam protein families database: towards a more sustainable future.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: D279-D285Crossref PubMed Scopus (3562) Google Scholar). The enrichment of the pClans in each list was determined using a background list of CA1 specific genes (see STAR Methods). Our analysis revealed that of the eight pClans enriched in the list of differentially expressed transcripts, six of them were enriched in the FMRP target list (Figure 2E; Table S3), indicating that the majority of differentially translating mRNAs in Fmr1−/y CA1 neurons are functionally similar to FMRP targets. It is possible that these changes are compensatory adaptations to the original loss of FMRP and subsequent dysregulation of FMRP target mRNAs. A major aim of our TRAP-seq experiments was to identify the excessively translating mRNAs in Fmr1−/y CA1 that underlie altered function. We began by performing an unbiased gene ontology (GO) analysis to determine whether any particular gene category was enriched in the differentially translating population isolated from the six sets of Fmr1−/y CA1-TRAP hippocampi. Separate analyses were performed for all differentially expressed transcripts, upregulated transcripts, and downregulated transcripts in the Fmr1−/y CA1-TRAP (Figure 2F; Tables S4–S6). Interestingly, our analysis of both total transcripts and upregulated transcripts revealed a significant enrichment of the G-protein-coupled (GPC) acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) signaling pathway (Figure 2G; Tables S4 and S5). Specifically, the Chrm4 and Chrm5 genes encoding the M4 and M5 receptors were upregulated in the Fmr1−/y CA1-TRAP samples (Tables S4 and S5). This result was particularly interesting in light of the well-known role of mAChRs, including M4, in the modulation of synaptic plasticity and excitability in the hippocampus (Bubser et al., 2012Bubser M. Byun N. Wood M.R. Jones C.K. Muscarinic receptor pharmacology and circuitry for the modulation of cognition.Handbook Exp. Pharmacol. 2012; : 121-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition to this analysis, we also wondered whether any of the differentially expressed mRNAs in the Fmr1−/y CA1-TRAP encoded targets for pharmacological intervention. We investigated this using the recently developed Drug Gene Interaction database (DGIdb; http://dgidb.genome.wustl.edu/), which ranks gene sets based on number of known drug interactions (Griffith et al., 2013Griffith M. Griffith O.L. Coffman A.C. Weible J.V. McMichael J.F. Spies N.C. Koval J. Das I. Callaway M.B. Eldred J.M. et al.DGIdb: mining the druggable genome.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 1209-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The results identified Chrm4 as the top candidate in our list (Figure 2H). Thus, the muscarinic receptor family represented both the most significantly overexpressed gene category in the Fmr1−/y CA1-TRAP and the most amenable to pharmacological manipulation. The mAChR family is comprised of five subtypes, which are coupled to either the Gq-PLC (M1, M3, and M5) or Gi/o/Gs-cAMP (M2 and M4) signaling pathways (Kruse et al., 2014Kruse A.C. Kobilka B.K. Gautam D. Sexton P.M. Christopoulos A. Wess J. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors: novel opportunities for drug development.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2014; 13: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Of these subtypes, M1, M4, and M3 are the most predominantly expressed in the hippocampus (Zang and Creese, 1997Zang Z. Creese I. Differential regulation of expression of rat hippocampal muscarinic receptor subtypes following fimbria-fornix lesion.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 1379-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To assess the translation of these receptors in Fmr1−/y versus WT CA1, we performed additional TRAP experiments and measured the levels of Chrm4, as well as of Chrm1 and Chrm3, using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Our results revealed a significant overexpression of Chrm4 (∗p = 0.0044) and Chrm1 (∗p < 0.0001), but not Chrm3, in the Fmr1−/y CA1-TRAP IP (Figure 3A). Although we also validated the increased expression of Chrm5 in the Fmr1−/y CA1-TRAP (∗p = 0.041), this transcript is much less abundant in the hippocampus (Figure S3). We therefore focused our further analyses on the M1, M3, and M4 subtypes. To determine whether the increased expression of Chrm4 and Chrm1 in the Fmr1−/y TRAP was due to a change in the basal expression of these transcripts in CA1 pyramidal neurons, we examined total mRNA expression in FACS-isolated GFP-L10a-expressing neurons. qPCR analyses revealed no elevation in Chrm4, Chrm1, or Chrm3 transcripts in these cells, suggesting that the increased expression of these transcripts in the translating ribosome fraction is not driven by an underlying change in transcription (Figure 3B). Next, we investigated whether the increased translation of Chrm4 and Chrm1 resulted in an increased expression of M4 and M1 receptors in the Fmr1−/y hippocampus. Consistent with our previous experiments using TRAP, quantitative immunoblotting of hippocampal slice homogenate shows a significant increase in M4 expression in the Fmr1−/y hippocampus (∗p = 0.0186; Figure 3C). This increase is also seen in synaptoneurosome fractions isolated from Fmr1−/y hippoc"

Synaptic transmission exemplifies a highly regulated mode of vesicle fusion, and its proper modulation ensures optimal functioning of the nervous system. The fusion of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane is powered by the assembly of the neuronal SNAREs: Synaptobrevin/VAMP on the synaptic vesicle (SV), and SNAP-25 and Syntaxin on the plasma membrane (Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012Jahn R.

Neurotransmitter release: the last millisecond in the life of a synaptic vesicle.Neuron. 2013; 80: 675-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Two factors control the amount of neurotransmitter released by an action potential: the number of available or “primed” SVs (denoted as the readily releasable pool, or RRP) and the release probability of a given SV (Pvr) (Neher, 2015Neher E. Merits and limitations of vesicle pool models in view of heterogeneous populations of synaptic vesicles.Neuron. 2015; 87: 1131-1142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Both of these factors are influenced by the concentration of presynaptic calcium, and both are substrates for modulation and use-dependent plasticity of the synapse (Fioravante and Regehr, 2011Fioravante D. Regehr W.G. Short-term forms of presynaptic plasticity.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2011; 21: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). What are the likely candidate proteins that control these aspects of synaptic transmission? One promising candidate is Munc13, which regulates RRP size by catalyzing SV priming (Richmond et al., 1999Richmond J.E. Davis W.S. Jorgensen E.M. UNC-13 is required for synaptic vesicle fusion in C. elegans.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, Rizo and Xu, 2015Rizo J. Xu J.

In addition, Munc13 affects post-priming aspects of SV fusion such as Pvr, and has been proposed to drive superpriming (Lee et al., 2013Lee J.S. Ho W.K. Neher E. Lee S.H.

Finally, Munc13 is also required for certain calcium-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity and neuromodulatory enhancement of synaptic strength through lipid signaling pathways (de Jong and Fioravante, 2014de Jong A.P.

Revealing the mechanistic foundation of Munc13 function will therefore shed light on many key aspects of synaptic transmission and its plasticity.

Several conserved protein domains flank the MUN domain and are thought to mediate interactions with lipids, calcium, and other proteins as a means of controlling Munc13 function and differentially regulating distinct SV pools (Hu et al., 2013Hu Z.

The most conserved of these modules is a tandem C1-C2 domain N-terminally adjacent to the MUN domain and present in all known neuronal Munc13 homologs, sharing about 70% sequence identity between rat and C. elegans. Much like the C1-C2 tandem domains of conventional PKCs, the C1 domain of Munc13 binds diacylglycerol (DAG) and beta phorbol esters (β-PEs) (Betz et al., 1998Betz A. Ashery U. Rickmann M. Augustin I.

The neighboring C2 domain (C2B) binds calcium and anionic phospholipids with a preference for both PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2 (Shin et al., 2010Shin O.H. Lu J. Rhee J.S. Tomchick D.R. Pang Z.P. Wojcik S.M.

Biol. 2010; 17: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Despite the work done on the C1 and C2B domains of Munc13, the mechanisms by which these modulatory domains alter Munc13 function remain enigmatic. The structure of the C1-C2B tandem domain together with the MUN domain was recently determined, and mutations designed to disrupt several domain interfaces revealed a variety of effects on synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity (Xu et al., 2017Xu J. Camacho M. Xu Y. Esser V. Liu X. Trimbuch T. Pan Y.Z. Ma C. Tomchick D.R. Rosenmund C. Rizo J. Mechanistic insights into neurotransmitter release and presynaptic plasticity from the crystal structure of Munc13-1 C1C2BMUN.eLife. 2017; 6https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22567Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar), highlighting the functional importance of these regulatory domains. Using a combination of genetics, biochemistry, and electrophysiology, we found that the C1-C2B module mediates a previously unknown inhibitory function in the C. elegans Munc13 ortholog UNC-13. In particular, removal of either the C1 or C2B domain enhanced calcium-triggered synaptic transmission whereas deletion of both domains almost eliminated synaptic transmission. Moreover, calcium liganding to C2B released autoinhibition, while a highly conserved linker between the C2B and MUN domains played a crucial role in maintaining the C1-C2B autoinhibition. The specific loss of UNC-13 autoinhibition significantly disrupted nervous system function, highlighting its physiological relevance. We propose that a combination of elevated calcium, PIP/PIP2 levels, and DAG production boosts Munc13 activity downstream of vesicle priming and enhances secretion by releasing C1-C2B from its inhibitory conformation. This calcium- and lipid-dependent relief of inhibition conveys a direct coupling of activity and modulatory signaling to SV fusion, and provides mechanistic insight into the post-priming roles of Munc13 in controlling synaptic strength. Of the six well-defined protein domains of Munc13-1/2, C2B shows the highest sequence conservation, with over 80% identity and 95% similarity to the C. elegans ortholog, UNC-13 (Figures 1A and S1A). In particular, all five aspartates required for calcium binding are also conserved across phylogeny (Figures 1B and S1B). To investigate the role of C2B in regulation of Munc13 function in vivo, a unc-13 null mutant C. elegans strain was rescued with a single copy of either full-length UNC-13 (scUNC-13(+)) or a version of the protein lacking its C2B domain (ΔC2B) expressed throughout the nervous system. The long isoform (UNC-13L) was chosen since this isoform suffices to restore synaptic function and behavior (Hu et al., 2013Hu Z. Tong X.J. Kaplan J.M. UNC-13L, UNC-13S, and Tomosyn form a protein code for fast and slow neurotransmitter release in Caenorhabditis elegans.eLife. 2013; 2: e00967Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Nervous system function was assessed by monitoring the locomotion of individual animals moving on an agar plate. unc-13(s69) null mutants were completely immobile whereas single-copy neuronal expression of UNC-13 in the null mutant restored wild-type (WT) locomotion (Figures 1C and 1D). Rescue of the null mutant with ΔC2B partially restored locomotion, suggesting that UNC-13 function is impaired in the absence of C2B. Note that locomotor speed is not directly related to NMJ synaptic strength as both increases and decreases in acetylcholine (ACh) secretion have been correlated with impaired locomotion (Martin et al., 2011Martin J.A.

The impact of the C2B domain on ACh secretion in vivo was assessed using acute sensitivity to the cholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb by quantifying the rate of paralysis upon exposure to 1 mM aldicarb. Numerous studies have established that impairment of ACh release decreases sensitivity to aldicarb and slows the rate of paralysis, whereas hypersecretory mutations accelerate paralysis (Mahoney et al., 2006Mahoney T.R.

Because unc-13 null mutants do not move, they cannot be evaluated by this assay. However, rescue of the unc-13 null allele with scUNC-13(+) fully restored WT aldicarb sensitivity, while the partial loss-of-function unc-13(e1091) mutant paralyzed more slowly (Figure 1E). Synaptic ACh release is reduced by more than 90% in the unc-13(e1091) mutant, consistent with the delayed paralysis observed here (Hu et al., 2013Hu Z. Tong X.J. Kaplan J.M.

Davis W.S. Jorgensen E.M. UNC-13 is required for synaptic vesicle fusion in C. elegans.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Remarkably, ΔC2B transgenic animals paralyzed significantly faster than WT, suggestive of an enhancement of ACh secretion. Replacement of worm C2B with rat Munc13-1 C2B completely restored WT secretory function in vivo, further highlighting the profound conservation of function between these two distantly related orthologs (Figure 1F). Rescue of unc-13 with a single-copy integrated transgene or overexpression using an extrachromosomal array produced the same degree of rescue, so the mode of transgene expression does not alter the impact of C2B on synaptic function (Figures S2D–S2F). Thus, locomotion is considerably impaired in ΔC2B animals, and this disruption of proper nervous system function originates from excessive rather than insufficient neurotransmitter secretion. We examined the specific impact of C2B on calcium-triggered fusion by recording stimulus-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) at the neuromuscular junction in dissected WT versus UNC-13(ΔC2B) animals in 1 mM external calcium (Figures 1G and S2A–S2C). Both the peak current amplitude and the total charge elicited by a single stimulus were significantly increased in the absence of the C2B domain, supporting the finding that synaptic transmission is enhanced in the absence of this critical protein domain (Figures 1H and 1I). Furthermore, the decay kinetics of the average EPSC were slower in the absence of C2B as a result of increased dispersion of the individual release events since there was no difference in the rise and decay kinetics of WT and ΔC2B unitary EPSCs (Figures S2D–S2F, 3E, and 3F) (Diamond and Jahr, 1995Diamond J.S. Jahr C.E. Asynchronous release of synaptic vesicles determines the time course of the AMPA receptor-mediated EPSC.Neuron. 1995; 15: 1097-1107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Notably, the increased secretion observed in ΔC2B animals did not appear to arise from a significant increase in the pool of primed SVs since there was no relative difference in sucrose-triggered secretion between synapses rescued with scUNC-13(+) versus ΔC2B (Figures S2I–S2K). In contrast, loss of unc-13 almost entirely eliminated the primed vesicle pool as previously observed (Madison et al., 2005Madison J.M. Nurrish S. Kaplan J.M. UNC-13 interaction with syntaxin is required for synaptic transmission.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 2236-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, Richmond et al., 1999Richmond J.E. Davis W.S. Jorgensen E.M.

Position of UNC-13 in the active zone regulates synaptic vesicle release probability and release kinetics.eLife. 2013; 2: e01180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the increased fusion observed in ΔC2B animals appeared to originate from a post-priming function of UNC-13. Behavioral assays performed while electrically silencing the motor neurons further indicated that calcium-triggered secretion was enhanced in ΔC2B animals (Figure S3). Taken together, these in vivo and in vitro synaptic assays indicate an unexpected enhancement of neurotransmitter secretion when the C2B domain of UNC-13 was removed, and the dysregulation of UNC-13 significantly impacted nervous system function. The Munc13-1/2 C2B domain binds anionic phospholipid membranes containing PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2 in a calcium-dependent manner (Shin et al., 2010Shin O.H. Lu J. Rhee J.S. Tomchick D.R. Pang Z.P. Wojcik S.M. Camacho-Perez M. Brose N. Machius M. Rizo J. et al.Munc13 C2B domain is an activity-dependent Ca2+ regulator of synaptic exocytosis.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), so calcium may modify the inhibitory function of C2B by translocating this region of Munc13 to the plasma membrane or altering its mode of membrane binding. Prior studies have identified specific structural changes within mammalian C2B upon calcium binding via five crucial aspartate residues distributed along two regions termed loop 1 and loop 3 (Figure 2A) (Shin et al., 2010Shin O.H. Lu J. Rhee J.S. Tomchick D.R. Pang Z.P. Wojcik S.M. Camacho-Perez M. Brose N. Machius M. Rizo J. et al.Munc13 C2B domain is an activity-dependent Ca2+ regulator of synaptic exocytosis.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These five aspartates are perfectly conserved in C2B across all known Munc13 orthologs (Figure S1B), and they coordinate two calcium ions in the bound state. Two of the aspartates in loop 1 (D705 and D711) have been mutated in previous studies, while less is known about the three aspartates in loop 3 (Shin et al., 2010Shin O.H. Lu J. Rhee J.S. Tomchick D.R. Pang Z.P. Wojcik S.M. Camacho-Perez M. Brose N. Machius M. Rizo J. et al.Munc13 C2B domain is an activity-dependent Ca2+ regulator of synaptic exocytosis.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Of particular interest, the major structural change in the bound state of C2B is the formation of a short alpha helix in loop 3 (Figure 2A). To explore the impact of calcium liganding in vivo, we first sought to create novel C2B variants that mimicked either the calcium-liganded or calcium-free conformational state of loop 3 using a combination of in silico modeling and in vitro biochemistry. Two neighboring aspartates on loop 3 (D757 and D759) interact with both bound calcium ions, and protein structure prediction software (Kelley et al., 2015Kelley L.A. Mezulis S. Yates C.M. Wass M.N. Sternberg M.J. The Phyre2 web portal for protein modeling, prediction and analysis.Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (6086) Google Scholar) indicated that mutations in these residues would impact loop 3 helix formation. In particular, we chose to replace these aspartates with glutamates to preserve the net electrostatic charge in this region of C2B while simultaneously eliminating the calcium-binding pocket. A similar strategy was reported for synaptotagmin 1 C2A (Striegel et al., 2012Striegel A.R. Biela L.M. Evans C.S. Wang Z. Delehoy J.B. Sutton R.B. Chapman E.R. Reist N.E. Calcium binding by synaptotagmin’s C2A domain is an essential element of the electrostatic switch that triggers synchronous synaptic transmission.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Computational predictions of secondary structure suggested that the glutamate substitutions favor the calcium-unbound state. In contrast, replacing the same loop 3 aspartates with neutralizing asparagines was predicted to stabilize the bound conformation, potentially mimicking the calcium-liganded state both structurally and electrostatically (Figure S4). To assess these predictions biochemically, recombinant WT rat Munc13-1 C2B domain (WT) was compared with glutamate and asparagine substitutions in loop 3 (respectively referred to as the DE or DN mutants hereafter). Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy of all three variants indicated that they were well folded with a characteristic β sheet spectrum (Figure 2B) (Shin et al., 2009Shin O.H. Xu J. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. Differential but convergent functions of Ca2+ binding to synaptotagmin-1 C2 domains mediate neurotransmitter release.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 16469-16474Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, thermal melting curves monitored by CD exhibited a steep transition typical of well-folded proteins, and the transition temperature range (50°C–60°C) was similar to that previously reported for C2 domains (Figure 2C) (Shin et al., 2009Shin O.H. Xu J. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. Differential but convergent functions of Ca2+ binding to synaptotagmin-1 C2 domains mediate neurotransmitter release.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 16469-16474Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the DN variant displayed a sharper melting transition between 55°C and 60°C compared to the WT and DE variants in the absence of calcium (Figure 2C), suggesting that this variant may adopt a more cooperatively folded state comparable to the calcium-bound state, as predicted by the structural model (Figure S4). To examine the impact of these mutations on calcium-dependent versus calcium-independent membrane binding, each of the three rat C2B variants was incubated with heavy liposomes containing sucrose along with a mixture of neutral and anionic phospholipids including PIP2 (see STAR Methods) in the presence and absence of 100 μM calcium (Figure 2D). After centrifugation and extraction of the phospholipids, the co-sedimenting protein fraction was recovered and quantified using SDS-PAGE. WT C2B exhibited a degree of membrane binding even in the absence of calcium, and 100 μM calcium significantly enhanced this binding as previously observed (Figures 2E and 2F) (Shin et al., 2010Shin O.H. Lu J. Rhee J.S. Tomchick D.R. Pang Z.P. Wojcik S.M. Camacho-Perez M. Brose N. Machius M. Rizo J. et al.Munc13 C2B domain is an activity-dependent Ca2+ regulator of synaptic exocytosis.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). By comparison, DN exhibited maximal membrane binding irrespective of calcium. In contrast, DE displayed minimal membrane binding in both low and high calcium. Based on these results, we conclude that the loop 3 DN variant mimics a constitutively calcium-liganded C2B while the DE variant stabilizes the C2B-unliganded state even in the presence of calcium. The three rat C2B structural variants were introduced into the worm UNC-13 protein in place of its native C2B sequence, and rescuing transgenic animals were generated in the unc-13 null mutant background (Figure 2G). While the WT rat C2B variant fully restored WT ACh secretion based on aldicarb sensitivity as noted earlier (Figures 1F and 2J), the constitutively liganded mimic rat C2B(DN) (rat DN) enhanced secretion to a similar degree as the C2B deletion variant (Figures 1E and 2H). In stark contrast, the calcium-free mimetic rat C2B(DE) transgenic animals (rat DE) exhibited significantly lower levels of ACh secretion. Similar transgenic animals were generated expressing the worm version of the bound- and apo-state mimetics (hereafter referred to as worm DN and worm DE), and these animals closely paralleled the rat C2B transgenic strains, confirming the functional conservation of the loop 3 ligand mimetic mutations (Figures 2H and 2J). A previous study examined the impact of a lysine-to-tryptophan substitution in loop 1 of the rat Munc13-2 C2B domain and found that this mutation enhanced calcium-triggered fusion in hippocampal autaptic cultures (Shin et al., 20"
https://openalex.org/W2745231155,"Cultural narratives on disability have received much attention over the past few decades. In contexts of poverty, limited information and everyday challenges associated with having, or caring for someone with a disability, different understandings have emerged. A project was set up to promote disability awareness in neighborhood communities in a rural part of Kenya, using a process of reflection and education. This paper reports on the first aspect–reflection. The aim was to investigate local understanding of disability as a co-constructed concept. The research questions were: 1. What cultural beliefs shape local understanding of disability? 2. What challenges are perceived to be associated with disability? A phenomenological approach was adopted. Focus group discussions were conducted with twenty-one community groups involving 263 participants and audio-recorded. The data were transcribed and thematic analysis was carried out. Visual maps were created to illustrate any interconnections, before establishing the final conclusions. Local beliefs attributed disability to: human transgression of social conventions, particularly concerning inappropriate family relations, which invoked a curse; supernatural forces affecting the child; the will of God; unexplained events; and biomedical factors. Challenges associated with disability related to the burden of caregiving and perceived barriers to inclusion, with stress as a shared bi-product. Local understanding of disability in this rural part of Kenya demonstrated overlapping explanations and plurality of beliefs. Two possible interpretations are offered. Firstly, oscillation between explanatory lines demonstrated instability, affecting broader acceptance of disability. Secondly, and more positively, in the face of challenges, the desire to make sense of the existing situation, reflected a healthy pluralism."
https://openalex.org/W2744679876,"Objective Clinical and in vitro studies suggest that subchondral bone sclerosis due to abnormal osteoblasts (Ob) is involved in the progression and/or onset of osteoarthritis (OA). Human Ob isolated from sclerotic subchondral OA bone tissue show an altered phenotype, a decreased canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (cWnt), and a reduced mineralization in vitro. In addition to the cWnt pathway, at least two non-canonical signaling pathways, the Wnt/PKC and Wnt/PCP pathway have been described. However, there are no reports of either pathway in OA Ob. Here, we studied the two non-canonical pathways in OA Ob and if they influence their phenotype. Methods Human primary subchondral Ob were isolated from the subchondral bone plate of tibial plateaus of OA patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty, or of normal individuals at autopsy. The expression of genes involved in non-canonical Wnt signaling was evaluated by qRT-PCR and their protein production by Western blot analysis. Alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin secretion (OC) were determined with substrate hydrolysis and EIA, respectively. Mineralization levels were evaluated with Alizarin Red Staining, Wnt/PKC and Wnt/PCP pathways by target gene expression and their respective activity using the NFAT and AP-1 luciferase reporter assays. Results OA Ob showed an altered phenotype as illustrated by an increased alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin release compared to normal Ob. The expression of the non-canonical Wnt5a ligand was increased in OA Ob compared to normal. Whereas, the expression of LGR5 was significantly increased in OA Ob compared to normal Ob, the expression of LGR4 was similar. Wnt5a directly stimulated the expression and production of LGR5, contrasting, Wnt5a did not stimulate the expression of LGR4. Wnt5a also stimulated the phosphorylation of both JNK and PKC, as well as the activity of both NFAT and AP-1 transcription factors. The inhibition of Wnt5a expression partially corrects the abnormal mineralization, OC secretion and ALPase activity of OA Ob. Conclusion These data indicate that the alteration of Wnt5a, a non-canonical Wnt signaling activator, is implicated in the modified signalisation and phenotype observed in OA Ob."

Although the rufomycin structure was already reported in the 1960s, its biosynthesis, including 3NTyr generation, remains unclear. To elucidate the rufomycin biosynthetic pathway, we assembled a draft genome sequence of S. atratus and identified the rufomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (ruf cluster), consisting of 20 ORFs (rufA–rufT). We found a putative heptamodular nonribosomal peptide synthetase encoded by rufT, a putative tryptophan N-dimethylallyltransferase encoded by rufP, and a putative trimodular type I polyketide synthase encoded by rufEF. Moreover, the ruf cluster contains an apparent operon harboring putative cytochrome P450 (rufO) and nitric oxide synthase (rufN) genes. A similar operon, txtDE, is responsible for the formation of 4-nitrotryptophan in thaxtomin biosynthesis; the cytochrome P450 TxtE catalyzes the 4-nitration of Trp. Therefore, we hypothesized that RufO should catalyze the Tyr 3-nitration. Disruption of rufO abolished rufomycin production by S. atratus, which was restored when 3NTyr was added to the culture medium of the disruptant.

Natural products have been found in a wide range of organisms, including plants, fungi, microorganisms, and mammals. Because these compounds exhibit various physiological activities applicable to medical and pharmaceutical products, animal drugs, and agricultural chemicals, they have been used to facilitate and improve human life. From a biochemical point of view, these compounds display diverse chemical structures, and many studies have focused on their biosynthetic mechanisms. The nitro group is not an abundant functional group in natural products, but it has been found in some important bioactive compounds, including chloramphenicol, aureothin, and thaxtomin (1Winkler R. Hertweck C. Biosynthesis of nitro compounds.Chembiochem. 2007; 8: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 2Parry R. Nishino S. Spain J. Naturally-occurring nitro compounds.Nat. Prod.

Although the mechanism for generating the nitro group in natural products is not fully understood, two possible nitration mechanisms have been reported. One is the oxidation reaction of an amino group found in chloramphenicol, aureothin, and pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis. In the former two cases, the p-amino groups of p-aminophenylalanine and p-aminobenzoic acid are oxidized to p-nitro groups using molecular oxygen as a substrate by the non-heme di-iron–containing monooxygenases CmlI (3Lu H.

Although its chemical structure was reported in the 1960s (26Takita T. Naganawa H. Maeda K. Umezawa H. The structures of ilamycin and ilamycin B2.J.

A study of the secondary structure of ilamycin B(1) by 300 MHz proton magnetic resonance.FEBS Lett. 1971; 17: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), its biosynthetic mechanisms are unclear. Rufomycin contains three non-proteinogenic amino acids, N-dimethylallyltryptophan, trans-2-crotylglycine, and 3-nitrotyrosine (3NTyr). The formation of N-dimethylallyltryptophan was found in cyclomarin biosynthesis, in which the tryptophan N-dimethylallyltransferase CymD catalyzes the N-prenylation of free Trp (28Renner M.K. Shen Y.-C. Cheng X.-C. Jensen P.R. Frankmoelle W. Kauffman C.A. Fenical W. Lobkovsky E. Clardy J.

Prod. 2010; 73: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mechanisms for generating trans-2-crotylglycine and 3NTyr are unknown. Although 2-crotylglycine is an intermediate in the degradation pathway of aromatic rings in Pseudomonas putida (30Kunz D.A. Ribbons D.W. Chapman P.J. Metabolism of allylglycine and cis-crotylglycine by Pseudomonas putida (arvilla) mt-2 harboring a TOL plasmid.J. Bacteriol. 1981; 148: 72-82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this pathway is unlikely to be used for 2-crotylglycine synthesis in rufomycin biosynthesis, and no enzymes for 3NTyr formation have been reported. Therefore, elucidating the rufomycin biosynthetic pathway will shed light on novel enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of 2-crotylglycine and 3NTyr. Here we report the identification and in silico characterization of the rufomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (ruf cluster). We also report genetic and biochemical analyses of a cytochrome P450 enzyme, RufO, which catalyzes the 3-nitration of Tyr. According to these analyses, we propose a probable rufomycin biosynthetic pathway. To elucidate the mechanisms of rufomycin biosynthesis and 3NTyr generation, identifying the rufomycin biosynthetic gene cluster is indispensable. Therefore, we first determined a draft genome sequence of S. atratus with the HiSeq 2000 system (Illumina) using a paired-end sequencing strategy. Then we searched the draft genome sequence for the rufomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in silico. Based on the rufomycin structure, we assumed that the rufomycin biosynthetic gene cluster should include a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene(s) for peptide assembly, a tryptophan N-dimethylallyltransferase gene for the synthesis of N-dimethylallyltryptophan, and a gene(s) for the nitro group synthesis. As expected, we found a gene cluster that satisfied all of these requirements (see below) and named it the ruf cluster. The nucleotide sequences of partially sequenced regions were determined by primer walking to complete the sequence of the ruf cluster (Fig. 1A and Table 1). Twenty ORFs (rufA-T) compose the ruf cluster, and four of them encode cytochrome P450 enzymes. One of the four cytochrome P450 genes (rufO) forms a putative operon with an NOS gene (rufN), and these two genes were expected to be responsible for the nitro group synthesis. An NRPS gene (rufT) and a tryptophan N-dimethylallyltransferase gene (rufP) were also found in the ruf cluster.Table 1Predicted functions of ORFs in the ruf clusterORFAmino acidsProposed functionrufA339LacI-like regulatory proteinrufB267α/β-HydrolaserufC375Cytochrome P450rufD48Hypothetical proteinrufE4,819Type I polyketide synthaserufF238ThioesteraserufG33Hypothetical proteinrufH53MbtH-like proteinrufI380AminotransferaserufJ135Hypothetical proteinrufK351ABC transporterrufL277ABC transporterrufM402Cytochrome P450rufN403Nitric oxide synthaserufO394Cytochrome P450rufP383Tryptophan N-dimethylallyltranferaserufQ124Hypothetical proteinrufR296Luciferase-like monooxygenaserufS399Cytochrome P450rufT8,027Nonribosomal peptide synthetase Open table in a new tab Here we describe the results of our in silico analysis of several important enzyme-encoding genes for rufomycin biosynthesis. Because rufomycin harbors three non-proteinogenic amino acids, we assumed that it should be synthesized by an NRPS. In the ruf cluster, we found a large gene (rufT) encoding a heptamodular NRPS, the domain component of which was consistent with the chemical structure of rufomycin (Fig. 1B). The substrate of each adenylation (A) domain was predicted by NRPS predictor 2 (supplemental Table S1) (31Röttig M. Medema M.H. Blin K. Weber T. Rausch C. Kohlbacher O. NRPSpredictor2: a web server for predicting NRPS adenylation domain specificity.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: W362-W367Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 32Rausch C. Weber T. Kohlbacher O. Wohlleben W. Huson D.H. Specificity prediction of adenylation domains in nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) using transductive support vector machines (TSVMs).Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5799-5808Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Although most of the predictions were not consistent with the structure of rufomycin, the A domain of the loading module was predicted to recognize N-dimethylallyltryptophan with high reliability. This result indicates that peptide assembly is initiated from N-dimethylallyltryptophan. The location of two methyltransferase (MT) domains at modules 1 and 4 also supports this notion. Modules 1 and 4 correspond to the second and fifth amino acid residues, respectively, in the rufomycin assembly pathway. When N-dimethylallyltryptophan is considered to be the first amino acid residue, the second and fifth amino acid residues are both N-methylleucine, which agree with the presence of MT domains at modules 1 and 4. Meanwhile, the A domain of module 2 was predicted to incorporate Tyr. This module corresponds to the third amino acid residue of rufomycin (i.e. 3NTyr), assuming that N-dimethylallyltryptophan is the first amino acid residue. If this prediction is correct, Tyr should be loaded on the thiolation (T) domain of module 2, and 3-nitration should occur during or after peptide assembly. However, because there is no report of A domains recognizing 3NTyr, it is impossible to predict 3NTyr as a substrate of any A domains. Therefore, it is also possible that 3NTy, instead of Tyr, is incorporated into the NRPS. In cyclomarin biosynthesis, CymD catalyzes the N-dimethylallylation of free Trp (28Renner M.K. Shen Y.-C. Cheng X.-C. Jensen P.R. Frankmoelle W. Kauffman C.A. Fenical W. Lobkovsky E. Clardy J. Cyclomarins A-C, new antiinflammatory cyclic peptides produced by a marine bacterium (Streptomyces sp.).J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 11273-11276Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 29Schultz A.W. Lewis C.A. Luzung M.R. Baran P.S. Moore B.S. Functional characterization of the cyclomarin/cyclomarazine prenyltransferase CymD directs the biosynthesis of unnatural cyclic peptides.J. Nat. Prod. 2010; 73: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the ruf cluster, rufP encodes a CymD homolog (44% identity). We speculate that N-dimethylallyltryptophan is synthesized by RufP. PKS genes (rufE and rufF) were found in the ruf cluster. RufE consists of three modules (loading module and modules 1 and 2), and RufF is a stand-alone thioesterase (TE) (Fig. 2A), and the RufEF PKS is most likely responsible for trans-2-crotylglycine biosynthesis. The loading module contains ketosynthase (KS), acyltransferase (AT), and acyl carrier protein (ACP) domains. Whereas KS domains generally catalyze decarboxylative Claisen condensation for C–C bond formation, a group of KSs called KSQ, in which the Cys residue for substrate binding is substituted by Gln, catalyze only decarboxylation (33Bisang C. Long P.F. Cortés J. Westcott J. Crosby J. Matharu A.L. Cox R.J. Simpson T.J. Staunton J. Leadlay P.F. A chain initiation factor common to both modular and aromatic polyketide synthases.Nature. 1999; 401: 502-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The KS domain of the loading module is classified as KSQ (Fig. 2B), suggesting that it catalyzes only the decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA to provide the acetyl starter unit. Module 1 consists of KS, AT, dehydratase (DH), ketoreductase (KR), and ACP domains, and module 2 consists of KS, AT, DH, enoylreductase (ER), KR, and ACP domains. RufF is a TE domain. Via such a domain organization, the RufEF PKS is expected to synthesize 4-hexenoic acid (Fig. 2A). In general, the cis-trans stereochemistry of a double bond formed by a DH domain can be predicted by analyzing the KR domain of the same module. KR domains can be classified into A, B, and C types based on the presence or absence of the conserved XXD motif and Trp residue, and the stereochemistry of their products can be predicted according to this classification (34Keatinge-Clay A.T. A tylosin ketoreductase reveals how chirality is determined in polyketides.Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 898-908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The KR domain of module 1 belongs to the B type, suggesting that the trans C=C bond is synthesized by module 1 (Fig. 2C). Thus, we speculate that RufEF produces trans-4-hexenoic acid, which is a compatible precursor for trans-2-crotylglycine biosynthesis. Hydroxylation and oxidation of the C2 position of trans-4-hexenoic acid can form trans-2-oxo-4-hexenoic acid, and transamination of the keto group can form trans-2-crotylglycine (Fig. 2A). We speculate that these reactions are catalyzed by a cytochrome P450 enzyme (RufC; see below) and an aminotransferase (RufI). In the thaxtomin biosynthetic gene cluster, txtD and txtE (encoding NOS and cytochrome P450, respectively) form a putative operon. We also found a putative operon consisting of NOS, P450, and tryptophan N-dimethylallyltransferase genes (rufN, rufO, and rufP, respectively) in the ruf cluster. RufO and RufN show 26 and 58% amino acid sequence identities with TxtE and TxtD, respectively. Although the sequence identity between RufO and TxtE was not high, we assumed that RufO and RufN should be responsible for the nitration of Tyr. The cytochrome P450 enzymes except for RufO encoded in the ruf cluster (RufC, RufM, and RufS) may catalyze occasional oxidative modification reactions, such as the epoxidation of N-dimethylallyltryptophan and the hydroxylation and oxidation of Leu, to synthesize other rufomycin derivatives. Although this biosynthetic process is hypothetical, we predict the roles of three P450 monooxygenases. Using a BLAST search with the primary sequence of RufC as query, we discovered several cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (∼50% identity with RufC) whose genes form an operon with PKS genes (supplemental Fig. S1A). Interestingly, these operons also encode an aminotransferase. In addition, the domain organization of the PKS discovered from Streptomyces aidingensis strain CGMCC 4.5739 is identical to that of RufE. Thus, RufC is most likely to be involved in trans-2-crotylglycine biosynthesis, and this trans-2-crotylglycine biosynthesis pathway seems to be distributed to other natural product biosynthetic pathways. Similarly, we predict the functions of RufM and RufS. Among the characterized enzymes, RufM and RufS show the highest identity with CYP107Z4 (46%) and TbtJ1 (45%), respectively. CYP107Z4 and TbtJ1 catalyze the hydroxylation of avermectin to produce 4″-oxo-avermectin (35Molnár I. Hill D.S. Zirkle R. Hammer P.E. Gross F. Buckel T.G. Jungmann V. Pachlatko J.P. Ligon J.M.

Watkins R.R. Brustad E.M. Bowers A.A. P450-mediated non-natural cyclopropanation of dehydroalanine-containing thiopeptides.ACS Chem.

This result implies that RufS should catalyze the hydroxylation of Leu; therefore, RufM is considered to play the remaining role, which is epoxidation of the dimethylallyl group. To confirm the involvement of the ruf cluster in rufomycin biosynthesis and to examine the contribution of the candidate P450 gene (rufO) to 3NTyr synthesis, we disrupted rufO using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (38Cobb R.E. Wang Y. Zhao H. High-efficiency multiplex genome editing of Streptomyces species using an engineered CRISPR/Cas system.ACS Synth. Biol. 2015; 4: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). A disruption plasmid was designed so that the rufO coding region could be cut by Cas9 and removed during the repair of the region, guided by the recombination template cassette introduced into the plasmid. After multiple trials, we isolated the rufO deletion strain (ΔrufO) (supplemental Fig. S2). We cultivated the wild-type and ΔrufO strains and compared their metabolic profiles in three nutrient-rich media, tryptic soy broth (TSB), International Streptomyces Project 2 (ISP2), and modified G-2 (MG2). After extracting metabolites with n-butanol, the organic phase was analyzed by LC-MS. In the wild-type strain cultivated in MG2, we clearly detected the production of four major compounds whose m/z values were identical to those of rufomycin derivatives reported previously (Fig. 3 and supplemental Table S2) (39Lambooy P.K. Process for the isolation of rufomycin factors.December 28, 2000Google Scholar). This indicates that these compounds are the rufomycin derivatives. Three of the four congeners (compounds 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 3) were also produced in ISP2 medium, whereas the rufomycin derivatives were hardly produced in TSB (data now shown). In contrast, in the ΔrufO strain, we did not detect any rufomycin derivatives or shunt products in any of the media. However, when 3NTyr was added to the culture medium of the ΔrufO strain, rufomycin production was fully recovered (Fig. 3). From these results, we conclude that the ruf cluster is responsible for rufomycin biosynthesis. In addition, the recovery of rufomycin production in the ΔrufO mutant denied the possibility that the mutant lost heptapeptide production because of the unexpected inactivation of rufP caused by the possible polar effect of the rufO deletion; rufP appears to form an operon, rufNOP, with rufN and rufO. Inactivation of rufP must inhibit the peptide synthesis, because rufP presumably encodes a tryptophan N-dimethylallyltransferase essential for producing the first amino acid (N-dimethylallyltryptophan) of the rufomycin peptide. We think that the substrate specificity of the A domain in module 2 of the RufT NRPS should be strict and that only 3NTyr can be accepted by RufT as the third amino acid residue in the peptide assembly line. Thus, nitration seems to occur prior to peptide assembly. To investigate the function of RufO in vitro, the recombinant RufO protein with a His8 tag at its C terminus was produced in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel chelate affinity chromatography (Fig. 4). The color of the obtained solution ranged from yellow to red, which is typical of cytochrome P450 solutions. The purified RufO protein was subjected to carbon monoxide (CO)-binding and NO-binding spectral analyses (40Omura T. Sato R. The carbon monoxide-binding pigment of liver microsomes. II. Solubilization, purification, and properties.J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2379-2385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bubbling of CO into the RufO solution resulted in the Soret band shifting from ∼420 to ∼450 nm (Fig. 5A). In the case of NO, a shift to ∼440 nm was observed (Fig. 5B). These physicochemical properties are consistent with those of typical P450 enzymes. All of these results indicate that the recombinant RufO was purified in an active form.Figure 5UV-visible spectroscopic study on RufO. A, CO-binding spectra.

Male mice (4 wk old) were treated with BPA (50 or 500 μg/kg/d) for 8 wk. Whole-body glucose homeostasis, pancreatic islet morphology and function, and miR-338-mediated molecular signal transduction analyses were examined. We showed that BPA treatment led to a disruption of glucose tolerance and a compensatory increase of pancreatic islets insulin secretion and pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1) expression in mice. Inhibition of Pdx1 reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and ATP production in the islets of BPA-exposed mice. Based on primary pancreatic islets, we also confirmed that miR-338 regulated Pdx1 and thus contributed to BPA-induced insulin secretory dysfunction from compensation to decompensation. Short-term BPA exposure downregulated miR-338 through activation of G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (Gpr30), whereas long-term BPA exposure upregulated miR-338 through suppression of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (Glp1r). Taken together, our results reveal a molecular mechanism, whereby BPA regulates Gpr30/Glp1r to mediate the expression of miR-338, which acts to control Pdx1-dependent insulin secretion. The Gpr30/Glp1r-miR-338-Pdx1 axis should be represented as a novel mechanism by which BPA induces insulin secretory dysfunction in pancreatic islets.-Wei, J., Ding, D., Wang, T., Liu, Q., Lin, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2745096246,"Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is the most harmful mycotoxin that occurs as natural contaminant of agricultural commodities, particularly maize. Practical solutions for detoxification of contaminated staples and reduction of agricultural wastes are scarce. We investigated the capability of the white-rot and edible fungus Plerotus eryngii (king oyster mushroom) to degrade AFB1 both in vitro and in a laboratory-scale mushroom cultivation, using a substrate similar to that routinely used in mushroom farms. In malt extract broth, degradation of AFB1 (500 ng/mL) by nine isolates of P. eryngii ranged from 81 to 99% after 10 days growth, and reached 100% for all isolates after 30 days. The growth of P. eryngii on solid medium (malt extract-agar, MEA) was significantly reduced at concentrations of AFB1 500 ng/mL or higher. However, the addition of 5% wheat straw to the culture medium increased the tolerance of P. eryngii to AFB1 and no inhibition was observed at a AFB1 content of 500 ng/mL; degradation of AFB1 in MEA supplemented with 5% wheat straw and 2.5% (w/v) maize flour was 71-94% after 30 days of growth. Further, AFB1 degradation by P. eryngii strain ITEM 13681 was tested in a laboratory-scale mushroom cultivation. The mushroom growth medium contained 25% (w/w) of maize spiked with AFB1 to the final content of 128 μg/kg. Pleurotus eryngii degraded up to 86% of the AFB1 in 28 days, with no significant reduction of either biological efficiency or mushroom yield. Neither the biomass produced on the mushroom substrate nor the mature basidiocarps contained detectable levels of AFB1 or its metabolite aflatoxicol, thus ruling out the translocation of these toxins through the fungal thallus. These findings make a contribution towards the development of a novel technology for remediation of AFB1- contaminated corn through the exploitation of the degradative capability of P. eryngii and its bioconversion into high nutritional value material intended for feed production."

https://openalex.org/W2742424071,"Spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) outbreaks are rapidly spreading throughout subalpine forests of the Rocky Mountains, raising concerns that altered fuel structures may increase the ecological severity of wildfires. Although many recent studies have found no conclusive link between beetle outbreaks and increased fire size or canopy mortality, few studies have addressed whether these combined disturbances produce compounded effects on short-term vegetation recovery. We tested for an effect of spruce beetle outbreak severity on vegetation recovery in the West Fork Complex fire in southwestern Colorado, USA, where much of the burn area had been affected by severe spruce beetle outbreaks in the decade prior to the fire. Vegetation recovery was assessed using the Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) two years after the fire, which occurred in 2013. Beetle outbreak severity, defined as the basal area of beetle-killed trees within Landsat pixels, was estimated using vegetation index differences (dVIs) derived from pre-outbreak and post-outbreak Landsat images. Of the seven dVIs tested, the change in Normalized Difference Moisture Index (dNDMI) was most strongly correlated with field measurements of beetle-killed basal area (R2 = 0.66). dNDMI was included as an explanatory variable in sequential autoregressive (SAR) models of NDVI2015. Models also included pre-disturbance NDVI, topography, and weather conditions at the time of burning as covariates. SAR results showed a significant correlation between NDVI2015 and dNDMI, with more severe spruce beetle outbreaks corresponding to reduced post-fire vegetation cover. The correlation was stronger for models which were limited to locations in the red stage of outbreak (outbreak ≤ 5 years old at the time of fire) than for models of gray-stage locations (outbreak > 5 years old at the time of fire). These results indicate that vegetation recovery processes may be negatively impacted by severe spruce beetle outbreaks occurring within a decade of stand-replacing wildfire."

An analysis of the precipitation, evaporation and runoff in relation to the climate variability demonstrates that although the salt balance in the Colombian Basin overall is in equilibrium, the area south of 12°N is an important dilution sub-basin. In the southwest of the basin, in the region of the Panama-Colombia Gyre, Caribbean Sea Water is diluted by precipitation and runoff year round, while in the northeast, off La Guajira, its salinity increases from December to May by upwelling. At the interannual scale, continental runoff is related to El Niño Southern Oscillation, and precipitation and evaporation south of 12°N are related to the Caribbean Low Level Jet. During El Niño years the maximum salinification occurs in the dry season (December-February) while in La Niña years the maximum dilution (or freshening), reaching La Guajira Coastal Zone, occurs in the wet season (September-November)."

It can down-regulate Bcl-2 and up-regulate Bax, to induce dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential and generation of reactive oxygen species. Caspase-3 was also activated by Isoalantolactone, with the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Our results reveal that Isoalantolactone induces intrinsic apoptosis in SK-MES-1 cells through p53 signaling pathway, which suggests that Isoalantolactone could be a potential leading compound for future development of anti-lung cancer drugs."

An understanding of the mechanism by which collagen biosynthesis is regulated in HSCs will provide important clues for practical anti-fibrotic therapy. Endoplasmic reticulum oxidase 1α (ERO1α) functions as an oxidative enzyme of protein disulfide isomerase, which forms intramolecular disulfide bonds of membrane and secreted proteins. However, the role of ERO1α in HSCs remains unclear. Here, we show that ERO1α is expressed and mainly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum in human HSCs. When HSCs were transfected with ERO1α siRNA or an ERO1α shRNA-expressing plasmid, expression of ERO1α was completely silenced. Silencing of ERO1α expression in HSCs markedly suppressed their proliferation but did not induce apoptosis, which was accompanied by impaired secretion of collagen type 1. Silencing of ERO1α expression induced impaired disulfide bond formation and inhibited autophagy via activation of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway, resulting in intracellular accumulation of collagen type 1 in HSCs. Furthermore, silencing of ERO1α expression also promoted proteasome-dependent degradation of membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), which stimulates cell proliferation through cleavage of secreted collagens. The inhibition of HSC proliferation was reversed by treatment with MT1-MMP–cleaved collagen type 1. The results suggest that ERO1α plays a crucial role in HSC proliferation via posttranslational modification of collagen and MT1-MMP and, therefore, may be a suitable therapeutic target for managing liver fibrosis.

In the liver, under physiological conditions, HSCs mainly accumulate vitamin A as retinyl ester in lipid droplets in the cytoplasm. Upon injury to or inflammation of the liver, HSCs lose vitamin A and transdifferentiate to myofibroblastic cells, so-called activated HSCs, which produce and secrete excessive extracellular matrices, including collagens, suggesting that activated HSCs are a major contributor to liver fibrosis and attractive target cells for anti-fibrotic therapy (3Friedman S.L.

During liver fibrosis, there is dramatic proliferation of activated HSCs, accompanied by excessive secretion and deposition of collagens in liver tissue. Our previous study and other studies also revealed that activated HSCs proliferate through the interaction of integrins with collagen molecules secreted by the HSCs (8Zhou X. Jamil A. Nash A. Chan J.

Collagens secreted by activated HSCs are cleaved by membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) on the cell surface, leading to exposure of the RGD motif on the surfaces of collagen molecules. Integrin αvβ1 on activated HSCs binds to the RGD motif in collagen molecules, resulting in promotion of proliferation and survival of activated HSCs. Therefore, the collagen/MT1-MMP/integrin signaling axis is indispensable for the proliferation and survival of activated HSCs; however, the molecular mechanism by which the collagen/MT1-MMP/integrin signaling axis in HSCs is regulated remains elusive. Intramolecular disulfide bond formation of the membrane and secreted proteins mainly relies on the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) machinery, which accepts electrons from client cysteine thiols (11Hudson D.A.

Mice lacking ERO1α, which is ubiquitously expressed in several tissues and cells, have an abnormal cardiac response to adrenergic stimulation, and mice lacking ERO1β, which is specifically expressed in pancreatic β cells, develop mild nonprogressive pancreatic β cell dysfunction with glucose intolerance (18Zito E.

The combined loss of function of ERO1α and ERO1β has been shown to compromise the extracellular matrix in mice and interfere with the intracellular maturation of procollagen (19Zito E. Hansen H.G.

Collagen type 1 consists of two molecules of collagen type 1α1 and one molecule of collagen type 1α2 and also has some disulfide bonds between these molecules, leading to the formation of a triple helix structure (20Hulmes D.J. Building collagen molecules, fibrils, and suprafibrillar structures.J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 137: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the disulfide bond in collagen molecules is formed by PDI (21Wilson R. Lees J.F. Bulleid N.J.

However, the functional significance of ERO1α in HSCs remains unclear. Here we investigated the expression of ERO1α in human HSCs and examined the effect of ERO1α silencing on the proliferation of HSCs via the collagen/MT1-MMP/integrin signaling axis to explore the functional significance of ERO1α in HSCs. We first confirmed the expression of ERO1α in human hepatic stellate cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) and primary human HSCs. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting showed that ERO1α is expressed in LX-2 cells, LI90 cells, and primary HSCs (Fig. 1, A and B). ERO1α was co-localized with HSP47, which is a collagen-specific chaperone and a marker of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in LX-2 cells (82.2%), LI90 cells (83.1%), and primary HSCs (80.6%) (Fig. 1C), indicating that ERO1α is expressed and mainly localizes in the ER in HSCs. To clarify the significance of ERO1α in HSCs, we investigated the proliferation of HSCs by silencing ERO1α expression. When LX-2 cells were transfected with three batches of ERO1α siRNA, the expression of ERO1α mRNA and protein was completely silenced (Fig. 2A). Because the knockdown efficiency of ERO1α expression in LX-2 cells transfected with ERO1α-A siRNA was the highest among the three batches of ERO1α siRNAs, and transfection with ERO1α-A siRNA inhibited the expression of ERO1α protein in LX-2 cells, LI90, cells and primary HSCs (Fig. 2B), we used ERO1α-A siRNA for the cell proliferation assay. Silencing of ERO1α expression induced impaired proliferation of LX-2 cells, LI90 cells, and primary HSCs but did not induce cell death during a period of 5 days after transfection with ERO1α-A siRNA (Fig. 2, C and D). Based on the results of the ERO1α siRNA–silencing experiment, we generated HSCs stably expressing ERO1α shRNA by transfection of two cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) with ERO1α shRNA–expressing plasmids to establish HSCs constitutively silencing ERO1α expression (Fig. 3A). Proliferation of the cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) stably expressing ERO1α shRNA was markedly suppressed compared with that of the cell lines stably expressing control shRNA (Fig. 3B). It has been reported that HSCs proliferate through activation of the FAK/MAPK signaling pathway and Akt/IκB signaling pathway (23Carloni V. Defranco R.M. Caligiuri A. Gentilini A. Sciammetta S.C.

Thus, we examined the phosphorylation of FAK and activation of the Raf-1/MEK/MAPK signaling pathway in two cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) stably expressing ERO1α shRNA. As shown in Fig. 3C, the phosphorylation of FAK and activation of Raf-1/MEK/MAPK in both LX-2 cells and LI90 cells were markedly inhibited by silencing of ERO1α expression. Intriguingly, phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 and Thr-308 and phosphorylation of IκB at Ser-32/36 were clearly detected in two cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) stably expressing ERO1α shRNA. Activation of the Akt/IκB signaling pathway in HSCs sustains their survival apart from the induction of cell proliferation (10Birukawa N.K. Murase K. Sato Y. Kosaka A. Yoneda A. Nishita H. Fujita R.

Chem. 2003; 278: 8083-8090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), suggesting that activation of the Akt/IκB signaling pathway is responsible for the survival of HSCs stably expressing ERO1α shRNA regardless of impaired cell proliferation via inactivation of the FAK/Raf-1/MEK/MAPK signaling pathway and that ERO1α plays a critical role in the proliferation of HSCs. We examined the secretion of collagen type 1 from HSCs stably expressing ERO1α shRNA. ELISA and immunoblotting of collagen type 1 showed that the amount of collagen type 1 secreted from the two hepatic stellate cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) stably expressing ERO1α shRNA was significantly smaller than that secreted from the two hepatic stellate cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) or from two hepatic stellate cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) stably expressing control shRNA (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, the expression levels of collagen 1α1 and 1α2 mRNAs in the two hepatic stellate cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) stably expressing ERO1α shRNA were slightly increased compared with those in the counterparts (Fig. 4B). Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence revealed that collagen type 1 had accumulated excessively in the two hepatic stellate cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) stably expressing ERO1α shRNA compared with the amount in two cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) stably expressing control shRNA (Fig. 4, C and D). Furthermore, immunoblotting under non-reducing conditions showed that collagen type 1 formed a triple helix in LX-2 cells and the LX-2 stably expressing control shRNA, but only a single chain of collagen type 1 was detected in LX-2 cells stably expressing ERO1α shRNA (Fig. 4E). These results indicated that silencing of ERO1α expression in HSCs causes impaired disulfide bond formation of collagen type 1, resulting in inhibition of collagen type 1 secretion. We then investigated whether the impaired proliferation of HSCs by silencing of ERO1α expression is rescued by addition of collagen type 1. Surprisingly, proliferation of two cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) stably expressing ERO1α shRNA progressed only modestly with addition of collagen type 1, and the rate of proliferation was significantly lower than the rates of proliferation of two cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) stably expressing control shRNA (Fig. 5, A and B). These results suggest that an additional obstacle other than impaired secretion of collagen type 1 is involved in the inhibited proliferation of HSCs by silencing of ERO1α expression. Some studies have demonstrated that unfolded or immature procollagens that have accumulated in the ER in fibroblasts and HSCs are mainly degraded by autophagy (26Kawasaki K. Ushioda R. Ito S.

Autophagy eliminates a specific species of misfolded procollagen and plays a protective role in cell survival against ER stress.Autophagy. 2009; 5: 1217-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined autophagy in two cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) stably expressing ERO1α shRNA. Immunofluorescence and immunoblotting of LC3 showed that there was no aggregation of LC3 or an increased level of LC3II in the two cell lines with or without ERO1α expression (Fig. 6, A and B). Formation of autophagosomes was also not observed in LX-2 cells stably expressing control shRNA or ERO1α shRNA (Fig. 6C). Intriguingly, phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase α1 (AMPKα1), an inducer of autophagy, was detected in two cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) stably expressing ERO1α shRNA but not in two cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) stably expressing control shRNA (Fig. 6B). On the other hand, phosphorylation of ULK1 at Thr-555, a target site of AMPKα1, was inhibited in two cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) by silencing ERO1α expression (Fig. 6D). Because silencing of ERO1α expression in HSCs stimulated phosphorylation of Akt (Figs. 3C and Fig. 6B), we further examined the phosphorylation status of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), an inhibitor of ULK1. As expected, phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser-2448, a target site of Akt, was observed in two cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) stably expressing ERO1α shRNA (Fig. 6B). Treatment with an Akt inhibitor at a concentration of 5 or 10 μm induced phosphorylation of ULK1 at Thr-555 and the formation of autophagosomes in LX-2 cells stably expressing ERO1α shRNA (Fig. 6, D and E). Treatment with the Akt inhibitor partially inhibited the expression of collagen 1α1 mRNA and collagen 1α2 mRNA in two cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) stably expressing control shRNA and ERO1α shRNA compared with that in the counterparts (Fig. 6F). However, although there was no significant difference in the expression levels of collagen 1α1 mRNA and collagen 1α2 mRNA between cells stably expressing control shRNA with the Akt inhibitor and cells stably expressing ERO1α shRNA with the Akt inhibitor, immunoblotting revealed that excessive accumulation of intracellular collagen type 1 in cells (LX-2 and LI90) stably expressing ERO1α shRNA was markedly ameliorated by treatment with the Akt inhibitor (Fig. 6G). These results indicate that silencing of ERO1α inhibits autophagy through activation of the Akt signaling pathway, causing excessive accumulation of collagens in HSCs. It has been shown that the proliferation of HSCs progresses through the modification of collagens with MMP2 and MT1-MMP, which are expressed by HSCs themselves (8Zhou X. Jamil A. Nash A. Chan J.

The expression levels of MT1-MMP mRNA, but not those of MMP2 mRNA, in two cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) stably expressing ERO1α shRNA were slightly higher than those in two cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) expressing control shRNA (Fig. 7A). On the other hand, the levels of MT1-MMP protein in two cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) stably expressing ERO1α shRNA were significantly lower than those in the counterparts, reflecting the reduced level of active MMP2 to which pro-MMP2 is transformed by the MT1-MMP–mediated activation process in two cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) stably expressing ERO1α shRNA (Fig. 7B) (29Kinoshita T.

Relationship between the proteasomal system and autophagy.Int. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2013; 4: 1-26PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, phosphorylation of Akt, but not of AMPKα1, was detected, and aggregation of LC3 was not observed in two cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) stably expressing ERO1α shRNA (Figs. 3C and Fig. 6), suggesting that the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway is responsible for the decrease in the level of MT1-MMP protein induced by silencing of ERO1α expression. Thus, we examined whether recovery of MT1-MMP proteins in HSCs stably expressing ERO1α shRNA is induced by treatment with a proteasome inhibitor, MG132. As shown in Fig. 7C, the expression of MT1-MMP protein in two cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) stably expressing ERO1α shRNA was completely rescued by treatment with 5 μm MG132. On the other hand, flow cytometric analysis showed that MT1-MMP was not localized in the cellular membrane but in the cytoplasm in LX-2 cells stably expressing ERO1α shRNA, regardless of recovery of MT1-MMP protein expression by treatment with MG132 (Fig. 7D). MT1-MMP protein has disulfide bond formation in the hemopexin domain (33Nagase H. Visse R. Murphy G. Structure and function of matrix metalloproteinase and TIMPs.Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 69: 562-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (2392) Google Scholar), suggesting that unfolded MT1-MMP protein that accumulates in HSCs by silencing of ERO1α expression is degraded through the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. As described above, secretion of collagens was impaired and degradation of MT1-MMP was enhanced in HSCs by silencing of ERO1α expression. The proliferation of HSCs is enhanced through the interaction of integrin β1 with collagens (10Birukawa N.K. Murase K. Sato Y. Kosaka A. Yoneda A. Nishita H. Fujita R. Nishimura M. Ninomiya T.

Because the expression of integrin β1 in HSCs was sustained despite the silencing of ERO1α expression (Fig. 3A), we examined whether addition of MT1-MMP–cleaved collagens promotes the proliferation of HSCs stably expressing ERO1α shRNA. A cell proliferation assay showed that the proliferation of two cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) stably expressing ERO1α shRNA was significantly enhanced by addition of MT1-MMP–cleaved collagen type 1, as was also observed in two cell lines (LX-2 and LI90) stably expressing control shRNA (Fig. 8, A and B). Excessive deposition of extracellular matrix containing collagens in response to injury or inflammation is a leading cause of liver fibrosis, which mainly depends on activation of HSCs, which synthesize collagen and promote their own proliferation via interaction with collagen. Thus, an understanding of the mechanism by which HSCs regulate the biosynthesis of collagen will provide a meaningful clue for practical anti-fibrotic therapy of organs. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that ERO1α, an oxidative enzyme of PDI that forms intramolecular disulfide bonds of membrane and secreted proteins (14Tsai B. Rapoport T.A.

https://openalex.org/W2744074452,"Chenopodium quinoa is a natural local lesion host of numerous plant viruses, including tospoviruses (family Bunyaviridae). Groundnut chlorotic fan-spot tospovirus (GCFSV) has been shown to consistently induce local lesions on the leaves of C. quinoa 4 days post-inoculation (dpi). To reveal the whole genome of GCFSV and its interactions with C. quinoa, RNA-seq was performed to determine the transcriptome profiles of C. quinoa leaves. The high-throughput reads from infected C. quinoa leaves were used to identify the whole genome sequence of GCFSV and its single nucleotide polymorphisms. Our results indicated that GCFSV is a phylogenetically distinct tospovirus. Moreover, 27,170 coding and 29,563 non-coding sequences of C. quinoa were identified through de novo assembly, mixing reads from mock and infected samples. Several key genes involved in the modulation of hypersensitive response (HR) were identified. The expression levels of 4,893 deduced complete genes annotated using the Arabidopsis genome indicated that several HR-related orthologues of pathogenesis-related proteins, transcription factors, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and defense proteins were significantly expressed in leaves that formed local lesions. Here, we also provide new insights into the replication progression of a tospovirus and the molecular regulation of the C. quinoa response to virus infection."
https://openalex.org/W2745218055,"Increased ribosomal DNA transcription has been proposed to limit muscle protein synthesis, making ribosome biogenesis central to skeletal muscle hypertrophy. We examined the relationship between ribosomal RNA (rRNA) production and IGF-1-mediated myotube hypertrophy in vitro Primary skeletal myotubes were treated with IGF-1 (50 ng/ml) with or without 0.5 µM CX-5461 (CX), an inhibitor of RNA polymerase I. Myotube diameter, total protein, and RNA and DNA levels were measured along with markers of RNA polymerase I regulatory factors and regulators of protein synthesis. CX treatment reduced 45S pre-rRNA expression (-64 ± 5% vs. IGF-1; P < 0.001) and total RNA content (-16 ± 2% vs. IGF-1; P < 0.001) in IGF-1-treated myotubes. IGF-1-mediated increases in myotube diameter (1.27 ± 0.09-fold, P < 0.05 vs. control) and total protein (+20 ± 2%; P < 0.001 vs. control) were not prevented by CX treatment. Suppression of rRNA synthesis during IGF-1 treatment did not prevent early increases in AKT (+203 ± 39% vs. CX; P < 0.001) and p70 S6K1 (269 ± 41% vs. CX; P < 0.001) phosphorylation. Despite robust inhibition of the dynamic ribosomal biogenesis response to IGF-1, myotube diameter and protein accretion were sustained. Thus, while ribosome biogenesis represents a potential site for the regulation of skeletal muscle protein synthesis and muscle mass, it does not appear to be a prerequisite for IGF-1-induced myotube hypertrophy in vitro.-Crossland, H., Timmons, J. A., Atherton, P. J. A dynamic ribosomal biogenesis response is not required for IGF-1-mediated hypertrophy of human primary myotubes."

Addiction is one example of a disorder defined by pathological behavior (drug seeking despite harmful consequences) in which there is no significant loss of neurons and for which there is no cure."
https://openalex.org/W2743768733,"Objectives Patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) are prone to disease relapse. Currently, no good biomarkers are available to predict relapses in individual patients. This study aimed to determine whether patients at risk for relapse can be distinguished based on increased in vitro autoantibody production. Methods Eighty-four proteinase 3 (PR3) anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) positive GPA outpatients were prospectively monitored for up to two years and 32 healthy controls were included. At periodic intervals peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated, cultured and in vitro production of total and PR3-ANCA-specific IgG was determined. Moreover, serum ANCA titers were measured by indirect immunofluorescence. Results Sixteen patients (21%) relapsed during the follow-up period. At time of inclusion no significant differences were present for ANCA production between relapsing and non-relapsing patients. Samples before relapse exhibited increased serum ANCA titers and in vitro PR3-ANCA IgG levels compared with inclusion samples from non-relapsing patients. When evaluating changes over time, increasing serum ANCA titers were observed prior to relapse compared to a 1-year follow-up from non-relapsing patients. No significant change in in vitro PR3-ANCA levels occurred prior to relapse, compared to non-relapse patients. Conclusions While differences were observed for the serum ANCA titer in relapsing and non-relapsing patients, monitoring in vitro PR3-ANCA IgG production does not improve relapse prediction in GPA patients."
https://openalex.org/W2744691429,"Empirical research has shown performance improvement of many different technological domains occurs exponentially but with widely varying improvement rates. What causes some technologies to improve faster than others do? Previous quantitative modeling research has identified artifact interactions, where a design change in one component influences others, as an important determinant of improvement rates. The models predict that improvement rate for a domain is proportional to the inverse of the domain’s interaction parameter. However, no empirical research has previously studied and tested the dependence of improvement rates on artifact interactions. A challenge to testing the dependence is that any method for measuring interactions has to be applicable to a wide variety of technologies. Here we propose a novel patent-based method that is both technology domain-agnostic and less costly than alternative methods. We use textual content from patent sets in 27 domains to find the influence of interactions on improvement rates. Qualitative analysis identified six specific keywords that signal artifact interactions. Patent sets from each domain were then examined to determine the total count of these 6 keywords in each domain, giving an estimate of artifact interactions in each domain. It is found that improvement rates are positively correlated with the inverse of the total count of keywords with Pearson correlation coefficient of +0.56 with a p-value of 0.002. The results agree with model predictions, and provide, for the first time, empirical evidence that artifact interactions have a retarding effect on improvement rates of technological domains."

His University of California, Davis, lab mostly uses stem cells to study cancer-causing gene mutations—not to develop potential therapies. But thanks to The Niche, a blog he has run since 2010, Knoepfler has become an international authority—and a dogged voice of caution—on the clinical use of stem cells. For years, he has sounded the alarm on hundreds of U.S. physicians and clinics advertising stem cells to treat everything from sore knees to spinal cord injury without oversight from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or support from randomized clinical trials. The blog, which now averages more than 4000 daily visits, has elevated him from an obscure bench scientist into a divisive figure."

Although none of the labmade embryos were transferred into women, the research team, led by embryologist Shoukhrat Mitalipov of Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, says the success paves the way for using the technique in the clinic to prevent the transmission of genetic disease. But evidence of the technique9s long-term safety is still lacking, and many researchers and ethicists have argued that germline editing—making permanent, heritable changes to the genome that could correct genetic disease, but also theoretically introduce other designer traits—should for now be limited to research exploring basic biology."
https://openalex.org/W2743581472,"Researchers have discovered tell-tale signs of Alzheimer9s disease in 20 elderly chimpanzee brains, rekindling a decades-old debate over whether humans are the only species that develop the debilitating condition. By examining brain regions afflicted by Alzheimer9s in humans, the team discovered that 13 chimps had amyloid plaques, and four also had the neurofibrillary tangles typical of more advanced stages of Alzheimer9s. Whether chimps actually succumb to Alzheimer9s or are immune from symptoms despite having the key brain abnormalities is unclear, because there were no behavioral data to indicate that these animals developed dementia. But either way, the work suggests that chimps could help scientists better understand the disease and how to fight it. And although some scientists are eager to begin new studies on chimps, but many wonder whether such research on these now-endangered animals will receive moral, or monetary, support."

Now, a team of economists has identified a new engine for growth: espionage. In the first study of its kind, researchers have analyzed more than 150,000 previously classified documents from the former East German Ministry for State Security (also known as the Stasi) that reveal thousands of industrial secrets stolen from the West—including plans for the Leopard I tank and the IBM 360 computer. Together, these thefts saved East German industry billions and boosted economic productivity: By one measure, industrial espionage closed the productivity gap between East and West Germany by some 8.6%. But the efforts also cannibalized investment in traditional R&D, with one researcher calling the undercover work, R&D on cocaine."

But on 13 August, the NASA detector is set to ride a SpaceX rocket to the ISS, where it will gain both a cleaner view of the cosmos and, crucially, a chance to collect cosmic rays for years. That should allow ISS-CREAM, as it is now called, to collect rarer, higher-energy cosmic rays in numbers large enough to trace the energy level where the power of supernova shock waves peters out."
