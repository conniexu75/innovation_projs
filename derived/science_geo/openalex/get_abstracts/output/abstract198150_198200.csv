https://openalex.org/W21771642,"When highly polymerized deoxyribonucleic acid is digested with pancreatic DNase and the digest further degraded with phosphodiesterase from intestinal mucose or snake venom, the mononucleotides formed are 5'-phosphates. Since a digest prepared in this manner with a purified venom diesterase contains only 5'-mononucleotides and practically
no nucleosides or polynucleotides, the pancreatic DNase must form only polynucleotides with 5' monoesterified phosphate end groups. Recently the enzymatic synthesis of polydeoxyribonucleotides from eoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates has been demonstrated. Thus both enzymatic synthesis and degradation of deoxyribonucleic acids have as yet involved only derivatives with 5'-monoesterified phosphate."

https://openalex.org/W3093915795,"N-Formylmaleamic acid, a probable intermediate in the bacterial metabolism of nicotinic acid, has been synthesized by photoisomerization of its transisomer, N-formylfumaramic acid. The compound previously reported to be N-formylmaleamic acid has been shown to be N-formylfumaramic acid."

https://openalex.org/W79336906,"The deoxyribonucleases1 of animal tissues are of two types which are readily distinguishable by the conditions necessary for activity on their substrate, DNA. The pancreatic DNase, which has been crystallized by Kunitz (1), is active in neutral solution in the presence of magnesium or certain other divalent cations (2). The DN ase predominant in most other tissues is active at a lower pH, in the presence of adequate ionic strength, but does not specifically require divalent ions."
