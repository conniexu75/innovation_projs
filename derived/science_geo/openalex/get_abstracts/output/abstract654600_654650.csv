https://openalex.org/W3036941151,"Objective Since December 2019, an increasing number of cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Now, more cases have been reported in 200 other countries and regions. The pandemic disease not only affects physical health who suffered it, but also affects the mental health of the general population. This study aims to know about the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of living using EQ-5D in general population in China. Methods An online-based survey was developed and participants were recruited via social media. The questionnaires included demographic and socioeconomic data, health status, the condition epidemic situation and EQ-5D scale. The relationships of all factors and the scores of EQ-5D were analyzed. Logistic regression model were used to the five health dimensions. Results The respondents obtained a mean EQ-5D index score of 0.949 and a mean VAS score of 85.52.The most frequently reported problem were pain/discomfort (19.0%) and anxiety/depression (17.6%). Logistic regression models showed that the risk of pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression among people with aging, with chronic disease, lower income, epidemic effects, worry about get COVID-19 raised significantly. Conclusion The article provides important evidence on HRQOL during the COVID-19 pandemic. The risk of pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression in general population in China raised significantly with aging, with chronic disease, lower income, epidemic effects, worried about get COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results from each categorical data can be used for future healthcare measures among general population."
https://openalex.org/W3036901136,"Prognostic information at diagnosis has important implications for cancer treatment and monitoring. Although cancer staging, histopathological assessment, molecular features, and clinical variables can provide useful prognostic insights, improving risk stratification remains an active research area. We developed a deep learning system (DLS) to predict disease specific survival across 10 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We used a weakly-supervised approach without pixel-level annotations, and tested three different survival loss functions. The DLS was developed using 9,086 slides from 3,664 cases and evaluated using 3,009 slides from 1,216 cases. In multivariable Cox regression analysis of the combined cohort including all 10 cancers, the DLS was significantly associated with disease specific survival (hazard ratio of 1.58, 95% CI 1.28-1.70, p<0.0001) after adjusting for cancer type, stage, age, and sex. In a per-cancer adjusted subanalysis, the DLS remained a significant predictor of survival in 5 of 10 cancer types. Compared to a baseline model including stage, age, and sex, the c-index of the model demonstrated an absolute 3.7% improvement (95% CI 1.0-6.5) in the combined cohort. Additionally, our models stratified patients within individual cancer stages, particularly stage II (p=0.025) and stage III (p<0.001). By developing and evaluating prognostic models across multiple cancer types, this work represents one of the most comprehensive studies exploring the direct prediction of clinical outcomes using deep learning and histopathology images. Our analysis demonstrates the potential for this approach to provide prognostic information in multiple cancer types, and even within specific pathologic stages. However, given the relatively small number of clinical events, we observed wide confidence intervals, suggesting that future work will benefit from larger datasets."
https://openalex.org/W3036077924,"The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan have affected more than 250 countries and regions worldwide. However, most of the clinical studies have been focused on Wuhan, and little is known about the disease outside of Wuhan in China. In this retrospective cohort study, we report the early clinical features of 80 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital in Beijing. The results show that 27 (33.8%) patients had severe illness. Six (7.5%) patients were admitted to the ICU, and 3 (3.8%) patients died. Forty-eight percent (39/80) of the patients had a history of living/traveling in Wuhan. Patients with severe- illness were significantly older (average age, 71 years old vs 44 years old) and had a high incidence of expectoration (59.3% vs 34.0%), shortness of breath (92.6% vs 9.4%), anorexia (51.9% vs 18.9%) and confusion(18.5% vs 0%) compared with nonsevere patients. The systolic blood pressure (median, 130 mmHg vs 120 mmHg) was higher and the oxygen saturation (median, 98.3% vs 92.0%) was significantly lower in severe patients than nonsevere patients. In addition, myoglobin (median, 56.0 ng/mL vs 35.0 ng/mL), troponin I (median, 0.02 pg/mL vs 0.01 pg/mL), C-reactive protein (median, 69.7 mg/L vs 12.9 mg/L) and neutrophils (median, 3.3×109/L vs 2.2×109/L) were significantly increased, while lymphocytes (median, 0.8×109/L vs 1.2×109/L), albumin (mean, 32.8 g/L vs 36.8 g/L) and the creatinine clearance rate (median, 91.2 vs 108.2 ml/min/1.73m2) were significantly decreased among severe patients. Our study revealed that older patients with high levels of C-reactive protein, myoglobin, troponin I, and neutrophil and high systolic blood pressure as well as low levels of lymphocytes, and albumin and a low creatinine clearance rate and oxygen saturation were more likely to have severe disease."
https://openalex.org/W3036428692,"Controlled-release and slow-release fertilizers can effectively supply nitrogen (N) while mitigating N loss. To determine the suitability of these fertilizers for plants in semi-arid environments, these fertilizers need to be evaluated under varying placement and temperature conditions. Several urea fertilizers were evaluated, including: uncoated, sulfur-coated (SCU), polymer-coated-sulfur-coated (PCSCU), and polymer-coated (PCU) with projected release timings between 45 and 180 d. Nitrogen release was measured under daily fluctuating or static temperatures applied either to the surface or buried in the soil. A second experiment consisted of two PCU sources and added a hanging bag placement comparison and low and high soil moisture treatments. For the first Experiment, the N in uncoated urea released shortly after application. The SCU and PCSCU treatments released > 80% of the N before the first sampling date. With fluctuating temperatures, the PCU 45, 75, 120, and 180 incorporated into the soil released N within +9, +9, -22, and -68 d of their expected timing. However, they released their N within 35 d when surface applied. Conversely, with static temperatures, PCU products released slowly, releasing under 80% for the entire study. The second experiment verified these results and showed no difference between low and high moisture and minimal release with fertilizer not in contact with soil. Each coated fertilizer in these studies exhibited slow/control release properties, but the PCU (surface applied) and SCU/PCSCU (surface applied or incorporated in soil) release was much more rapid than expected. Our research suggests that, although the SCU and PCSCU showed minimal slow-release properties (regardless of placement), the PCU fertilizers incorporated in the soil do have a controlled release approximate to what is expected, but have a much more rapid release when surface applied."
https://openalex.org/W3036950804,"The advent of social media changed the way we consume content favoring a disintermediated access and production. This scenario has been matter of critical discussion about its impact on society. Magnified in the case of Arab Spring or heavily criticized in the Brexit and 2016 U.S. elections. In this work we explore information consumption on Twitter during the last European electoral campaign by analyzing the interaction patterns of official news sources, fake news sources, politicians, people from the showbiz and many others. We extensively explore interactions among different classes of accounts in the months preceding the last European elections, held between 23rd and 26th of May, 2019. We collected almost 400,000 tweets posted by 863 accounts having different roles in the public society. Through a thorough quantitative analysis we investigate the information flow among them, also exploiting geolocalized information. Accounts show the tendency to confine their interaction within the same class and the debate rarely crosses national borders. Moreover, we do not find any evidence of an organized network of accounts aimed at spreading disinformation. Instead, disinformation outlets are largely ignored by the other actors and hence play a peripheral role in online political discussions."
https://openalex.org/W3036221949,"Forced alcohol (ethanol, EtOH) exposure has been shown to cause significant impairments on reversal learning, a widely-used assay of cognitive flexibility, specifically on fully-predictive, deterministic versions of this task. However, previous studies have not adequately considered voluntary EtOH consumption and sex effects on probabilistic reversal learning. The present study aimed to fill this gap in the literature.Male and female Long-Evans rats underwent either 10 weeks of voluntary intermittent 20% EtOH access or water only (H2O) access. Rats were then pretrained to initiate trials and learn stimulus-reward associations via touchscreen response, and subsequently required to select between two visual stimuli, rewarded with probability 0.70 or 0.30. In the final phase, reinforcement contingencies were reversed.We found significant sex differences on several EtOH-drinking variables, with females reaching a higher maximum EtOH consumption, exhibiting more high-drinking days, and escalating their EtOH at a quicker rate compared to males. During early abstinence, EtOH drinkers (and particularly EtOH-drinking females) made more initiation omissions and were slower to initiate trials than H2O drinking controls, especially during pretraining. A similar pattern in trial initiations was also observed in discrimination, but not in reversal learning. EtOH drinking rats were unaffected in their reward collection and stimulus response times, indicating intact motivation and motor responding. Although there were sex differences in discrimination and reversal phases, performance improved over time. We also observed sex-independent drinking group differences in win-stay and lose-shift strategies specific to the reversal phase.Females exhibit increased vulnerability to EtOH effects in early learning: there were sex-dependent EtOH effects on attentional measures during pretraining and discrimination phases. We also found sex-independent EtOH effects on exploration strategies during reversal. Future studies should aim to uncover the neural mechanisms for changes in attention and exploration in both acute and prolonged EtOH withdrawal."
https://openalex.org/W3036189901,"To evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and treatment patterns of ranibizumab 0.5 mg in treatment-naïve patients with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) enrolled in the LUMINOUS™ study.A 5-year, global, prospective, multicenter, observational, open-label study conducted in a clinical practice (real-world) setting at outpatient ophthalmology clinics that recruited 30,138 consenting adult patients from all approved indications for ranibizumab across 42 countries. Patients with BRVO were treated according to the local ranibizumab label of the participating countries. Mean change in visual acuity (VA) in Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters from baseline to Year 1, treatment exposure during Year 1, and adverse events (AEs) over 5 years were assessed.Of the 1366 recruited BRVO patients, 405 were treatment-naïve at baseline with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 67.9 (12.5) years, 57.5% were female, and 71.8% were White. At Year 1 (n = 189), the mean (SD) VA gain was 11.9 (17.66) letters from a baseline of 49.2 (±20.32) letters with a mean (SD) of 5.0 (2.34) injections. VA gains were higher in patients (n = 83) who received 6-9 injections (13.6 [20.16] letters) than in those who received 2-5 injections (n = 92, 11.7 [15.43] letters), or 1 injection (n = 14, 3.6 [13.72] letters). Patients with baseline VA <23 letters had numerically highest VA gains (n = 20, 31.1 [24.48] letters). Over 5 years, the rate of ocular/non-ocular AEs was 7.4%/9.1% and serious AEs was 0.3%/4.4% in treatment-naïve BRVO patients (n = 405).One year results from the LUMINOUS real-world study showed a clinically meaningful VA improvement with ranibizumab in treatment-naïve patients with BRVO; numerically higher VA gains were achieved in patients who received more injections and those with poor baseline VA. No new safety signals were observed."
https://openalex.org/W3036639865,"Despite significant development of melanoma therapies, death rates remain high. MicroRNAs, controlling posttranscriptionally gene expression, play role in development of resistance to BRAF inhibitors. The aim of the study was to assess the role of miR-410-3p in response to vemurafenib–BRAF inhibitor. FFPE tissue samples of 12 primary nodular melanomas were analyzed. With the use of Laser Capture Microdissection, parts of tumor, transient tissue, and adjacent healthy tissue were separated. In vitro experiments were conducted on human melanoma cell lines A375, G361, and SK-MEL1. IC50s of vemurafenib were determined using MTT method. Cells were transfected with miR-410-3p mimic, anti-miR-410-3p and their non-targeting controls. ER stress was induced by thapsigargin. Expression of isolated RNA was determined using qRT-PCR. We have found miR-410-3p is downregulated in melanoma tissues. Its expression is induced by vemurafenib in melanoma cells. Upregulation of miR-410-3p level increased melanoma cells resistance to vemurafenib, while its inhibition led to the decrease of resistance. Induction of ER stress increased the level of miR-410-3p. miR-410-3p upregulated the expression of AXL in vitro and correlated with markers of invasive phenotype in starBase. The study shows a novel mechanism of melanoma resistance. miR-410-3p is induced by vemurafenib in melanoma cells via ER stress. It drives switching to the invasive phenotype that leads to the response and resistance to BRAF inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W3036365476,"After mating, female mosquitoes need animal blood to develop their eggs. In the process of acquiring blood, they may acquire pathogens, which may cause different diseases in humans such as malaria, zika, dengue, and chikungunya. Therefore, knowing the parity status of mosquitoes is useful in control and evaluation of infectious diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, where parous mosquitoes are assumed to be potentially infectious. Ovary dissections, which are currently used to determine the parity status of mosquitoes, are very tedious and limited to few experts. An alternative to ovary dissections is near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which can estimate the age in days and the infectious state of laboratory and semi-field reared mosquitoes with accuracies between 80 and 99%. No study has tested the accuracy of NIRS for estimating the parity status of wild mosquitoes. In this study, we train an artificial neural network (ANN) models on NIR spectra to estimate the parity status of wild mosquitoes. We use four different datasets: An. arabiensis collected from Minepa, Tanzania (Minepa-ARA); An. gambiae s.s collected from Muleba, Tanzania (Muleba-GA); An. gambiae s.s collected from Burkina Faso (Burkina-GA); and An.gambiae s.s from Muleba and Burkina Faso combined (Muleba-Burkina-GA). We train ANN models on datasets with spectra preprocessed according to previous protocols. We then use autoencoders to reduce the spectra feature dimensions from 1851 to 10 and re-train the ANN models. Before the autoencoder was applied, ANN models estimated parity status of mosquitoes in Minepa-ARA, Muleba-GA, Burkina-GA and Muleba-Burkina-GA with out-of-sample accuracies of 81.9±2.8 (N = 274), 68.7±4.8 (N = 43), 80.3±2.0 (N = 48), and 75.7±2.5 (N = 91), respectively. With the autoencoder, ANN models tested on out-of-sample data achieved 97.1±2.2% (N = 274), 89.8 ± 1.7% (N = 43), 93.3±1.2% (N = 48), and 92.7±1.8% (N = 91) accuracies for Minepa-ARA, Muleba-GA, Burkina-GA, and Muleba-Burkina-GA, respectively. These results show that a combination of an autoencoder and an ANN trained on NIR spectra to estimate the parity status of wild mosquitoes yields models that can be used as an alternative tool to estimate parity status of wild mosquitoes, especially since NIRS is a high-throughput, reagent-free, and simple-to-use technique compared to ovary dissections."
https://openalex.org/W3036275366,"Background Saudi Arabia is considering increasing the role of the private sector’s participation in financing and delivering healthcare services through the adoption of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). However, the adoption and successful implementation of PPPs in the Saudi healthcare sector requires careful attention to overcome potential obstacles. Objectives This study investigates and identifies potential barriers to the successful implementation of PPPs in the Saudi healthcare sector. Methods A pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 72 respondents over a two-month period. Respondents were asked to rate the degree of influence of potential key barriers using a five-point Likert scale. The collected data was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results The evidence showed that the top three barriers, as rated by the respondents, were legal barriers, including delays in receiving approval and permits and law and regulation changes, environmental barriers, including lack of transparency and accountability and technological barriers, including a shortage of professionals qualified to handle PPP projects. Conclusions The barriers identified suggested that the government should ensure that PPPs are implemented in a timely manner to ensure that private sector involvement yields the intended benefits. Furthermore, a stable legal and regulatory framework must be established that is properly and easily enforced to avoid confusing stakeholders with too many changes. It is also important to ensure that transparency and accountability measures are strengthened."
https://openalex.org/W3036330247,"Background The impact of antenatal depression on pregnancy outcomes has been well investigated in developed countries, but few studies have been conducted in low-income countries. As depression is significantly affected by socio-economic and cultural factors, it would be difficult to generalize evidence from high-income countries to low-income countries. We conducted a community-based cohort study to estimate the incidence of adverse birth outcomes and the direct and indirect pathways via which depression and other psychosocial risk factors may impact such birth outcomes within Gondar town, Ethiopia. Methods The study followed 916 pregnant women who were screened for antenatal depression using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). We also assessed the incidence of preterm births, Low Birth Weight (LBW) and stillbirths. Modified Poisson regression was used to estimate the relative risk of predictors on adverse birth outcomes and a Generalized Structural Equation Model (GSEM) was used to estimate the direct and indirect effect of antenatal depression and other psychological risk factors on adverse birth outcomes. Results The cumulative incidence of stillbirth, LBW and preterm was 1.90%, 5.25%, and 16.42%, respectively. The risk of preterm birth was 1.61, 1.46, 1.49, and 1.77 times higher among participants who identified as Muslim, reported being fearful of delivery, were government employee’s, and who had no antenatal care services, respectively. Partner support moderated the association between depression, preterm birth, and LBW. Depression had no direct effect on birth outcomes but indirectly affected preterm birth via partner support. Religion had both direct and indirect effects on preterm birth, while occupation and fear of delivery had direct effects. The risk of LBW was 9.44 and 2.19 times higher among preterm births and those who had exposure to tobacco, respectively. Stress coping was indirectly associated, and preterm birth and tobacco exposure were directly associated with LBW. The risk of stillbirth was 3.22 times higher in women with antenatal depression and 73% lower in women with higher coping abilities. Conclusions There was a high incidence of all adverse birth outcomes in Gondar Town. Depression and psychosocial risk factors had important indirect negative effects on risk, while partner support provided a positive indirect effect on the incidence of adverse birth outcomes. Interventions that focus on increasing partner engagement and participation in antenatal support may help reduce adverse birth outcomes by enhancing maternal resilience."
https://openalex.org/W3036437894,"Background Therapeutic ultrasound (US) is a promising physical therapy modality for peripheral nerve regeneration. However, it is necessary to identify the most effective US parameters and clarify the underlying mechanisms before its clinical application. The intensity of US is one of the most important parameters. However, the optimum intensity for the promotion of peripheral nerve regeneration has yet to be determined. Objectives To identify the optimum intensity of US necessary for the promotion of peripheral nerve regeneration after crush injuries in rats and to clarify the underlying mechanisms of US by mRNA expression analysis. Methods We inflicted sciatic nerve crush injuries on adult Lewis rats and performed ultrasound irradiation using 4 different US intensities: 0 (sham stimulation), 30, 140, and 250 mW/cm2 with frequency (5 days/week) and duration (5 min/day). We evaluated peripheral nerve regeneration by quantitative real-time PCR one week after injury. Histomorphometric analyses and motor function analysis were evaluated 3 weeks after injury. Results US stimulation enhanced re-myelination as well as sprouting of axons, especially at an intensity of 140 mW/cm2. mRNA expression revealed that US suppressed the expression of the inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 and the axonal growth inhibitors SEMA3A and GSK3β. Conclusions An intensity of 140 mW/cm2 was optimal to support regeneration of the sciatic nerve after a crush injury in rats by, in part, the suppression of pro-inflammatory and nerve growth inhibitor gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W3036735138,"Obesity remains a primary threat to the health of most Americans, with over 66% considered overweight or obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2 or greater. A common treatment option many believe to be effective, and therefore turn to, is exercise. However, the amount of weight loss from exercise training is often disappointingly less than expected with greater amounts of exercise not always promoting greater weight loss. Increases in energy intake have been prescribed as the primary reason for this lack of weight loss success with exercise. Research has mostly focused on alterations in hormonal mediators of appetite (e.g.: ghrelin, peptide YY, GLP-1, pancreatic polypeptide, and leptin) that may increase hunger and/or reduce satiety to promote greater energy intake with exercise training. A less understood mechanism that may be working to increase energy intake with exercise is reward-driven feeding, a strong predictor of energy intake and weight status but rarely analyzed in the context of exercise.Sedentary men and women (BMI: 25-35 kg/m2, N = 52) were randomized into parallel aerobic exercise training groups partaking in either two or six exercise sessions/week, or sedentary control for 12 weeks.The reinforcing value of food was measured by an operant responding progressive ratio schedule task (the behavioral choice task) to determine how much work participants were willing to perform for access to a healthy food option relative to a less healthy food option before and after the exercise intervention. Body composition and resting energy expenditure were assessed via DXA and indirect calorimetry, respectively, at baseline and post testing.Changes in fat-free mass predicted the change in total amount of operant responding for food (healthy and unhealthy). There were no correlations between changes in the reinforcing value of one type of food (healthy vs unhealthy) to changes in body composition.In support of previous work, reductions in fat-free mass resulting from an aerobic exercise intervention aimed at weight loss plays an important role in energy balance regulation by increasing operant responding for food."
https://openalex.org/W3036896642,"Background Autoimmune conditions (AICs) and/or their treatment may alter risk of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and females with AICs are therefore at an increased risk of cervical dysplasia. However, inclusion of these at-risk populations in cervical cancer screening and HPV-vaccination guidelines, are mostly lacking. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of cervical dysplasia in a wide range of AICs and compare that to HIV and immunocompetent controls to support the optimisation of cervical cancer preventive health measures. Methods Data linkage was used to match cervical screening episodes to emergency department records of females with AICs or HIV to immunocompetent controls over a 14-year period. The primary outcome was histologically confirmed high-grade cervical disease. Results, measured as rates by cytology and histology classification per 1,000 females screened, were analysed per disease group, and intergroup comparisons were performed. Results Females with inflammatory bowel disease (2,683), psoriatic and enteropathic arthropathies (1,848), multiple sclerosis (MS) (1,426), rheumatoid arthritis (1,246), systemic lupus erythematosus and/or mixed connective tissue disease (SLE/MCTD) (702), HIV (44), and 985,383 immunocompetent controls were included. SLE/MCTD and HIV groups had greater rates of high-grade histological and cytological abnormalities compared to controls. Increased rates of low-grade cytological abnormalities were detected in all females with AICs, with the exception of the MS group. Conclusions Females with SLE/MCTD or HIV have increased rates of high-grade cervical abnormalities. The increased low-grade dysplasia rate seen in most females with AICs is consistent with increased HPV infection. These findings support expansion of cervical cancer preventative programs to include these at-risk females."
https://openalex.org/W3035857330,"Rationale/background Though much smaller than the bovine industry, the porcine sector in Argentina involves a large number of farms and represents a significant economic sector. In recent years Argentina has implemented a national registry of swine movements amongst other measures, in an effort to control and eventually eradicate endemic Aujesky’s disease. Such information can prove valuable in assessing the risk of transmission between farms for endemic diseases but also for other diseases at risk of emergence. Methods Shipment data from 2011 to 2016 were analyzed in an effort to define strategic locations and times at which control and surveillance efforts should be focused to provide cost-effective interventions. Social network analysis (SNA) was used to characterize the network as a whole and at the individual farm and market level to help identify important nodes. Spatio-temporal trends of pig movements were also analyzed. Finally, in an attempt to classify farms and markets in different groups based on their SNA metrics, we used factor analysis for mixed data (FAMD) and hierarchical clustering. Results The network involved approximate 136,000 shipments for a total of 6 million pigs. Over 350 markets and 17,800 production units participated in shipments with another 83,500 not participating. Temporal data of shipments and network metrics showed peaks in shipments in September and October. Most shipments where within provinces, with Buenos Aires, Cordoba and Santa Fe concentrating 61% of shipments. Network analysis showed that markets are involved in relatively few shipments but hold strategic positions with much higher betweenness compared to farms. Hierarchical clustering yielded four groups based on SNA metrics and node characteristics which can be broadly described as: 1. small and backyard farms; 2. industrial farms; 3. markets; and 4. a single outlying market with extreme centrality values. Conclusion Characterizing the network structure and spatio-temporal characteristics of Argentine swine shipments provides valuable information that can guide targeted and more cost-effective surveillance and control programs. We located key nodes where efforts should be prioritized. Pig network characteristics and patterns can be used to create dynamic disease transmission models, which can both be used in assessing the impact of emerging diseases and guiding efforts to eradicate endemic ones."
https://openalex.org/W3036524506,"Classical swine fever (CSF) is an infectious viral disease caused by an RNA virus belonging to the Pestivirus genus. A total of 134 outbreaks of CSF have occurred in the last seven years in the North of Colombia. The objective of this study was the characterization of the herds affected by CSF from 2013 to 2018. Most of the outbreaks (95%) occured in backyard piggeries. The principal causes of transmission of CSF were the introduction of infected pigs (38%), movements of people (37%) and unknown origin (13%). The epidemiological relationships with 15 affected farms explained 31 outbreaks. The overall attack and mortality rates were 39% and 32%, respectively. The main clinical signs were high fever (67%), incoordination of movements (54%), and prostration (52%). Seventy-three percent of the herds had not been vaccinated against CSF and 17% had been only partially vaccinated. A spatio-temporal analysis, using a Poisson regression model, revealed two clusters with high risk; the first and largest one from 2014 to 2016 had a relative risk (RR) of 13.4 and included part of the departments of Atlántico, Bolívar, Cesar, La Guajira, Norte de Santander, Magdalena and Sucre; and the second cluster (RR = 9.6 in 2016) included municipalities in the north of the department of Cordoba."
https://openalex.org/W3035904356,"Increasing intensification in swine production has led to new and specialized technologies, but the occupational health and safety impacts are rarely quantified in the business plans for adoption. Needle-less injection has potential to increase productivity and eliminate needle stick injury in workers, but it is not clear whether these benefits offset high capital investment and potential increases in musculoskeletal loads. This economic evaluation employed probabilistic scenario analysis using injury, cost, and production data gathered from interviews with swine producers in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. After adoption of needle-less injection, rates of needle-stick injury went down with no measureable effect on upper limb musculoskeletal disorders, resulting in lower health and safety costs for needle-less injectors. Needle-less injection duration was 40% faster once workers acclimatized, but large start-up costs mean economic benefits are realized only after the first year. The incremental benefit cost ratio promoted adoption of needle-less injectors over conventional needles for the base case of a 1200 sow barn; the conventional method is beneficial for barns with 600 sows or less. Findings indicate that well-designed technologies have the potential to achieve the dual ergonomics goals of enhancing human wellbeing and system performance. We anticipate that the economic and decision models developed in this study can be applied to other new technologies in agriculture and animal production."
https://openalex.org/W3036022599,"In comparison to male patients with coronary artery disease, female patients suffer from more comorbidities, experience symptoms of coronary artery disease differently and report poorer health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after coronary revascularization. However, there is limited data on the impact of comorbidity burden on the recovery in HRQoL in female and male patients. We investigated the impact of comorbidity burden on the change in HRQoL following coronary revascularization in female patients versus male patients. 230 patients (60 female) with coronary artery disease were assessed before, and two weeks, three months and six months after coronary revascularization. Disease-specific HRQoL was measured with the Short-Form Seattle Angina Questionnaire. Physical and mental health was measured with the Short-Form Health Survey. Comorbidity burden was assessed by the total number of identified comorbidity conditions and by the Charlson comorbidity score. Linear mixed models were used to estimate the effects of time, gender and comorbidity burden on HRQoL. Whereas HRQoL improved after coronary revascularization in all patients, female patients reported poorer physical health and disease-specific HRQoL and their physical health improved more slowly than male patients. A higher comorbidity burden was related with poorer physical health and disease-specific HRQoL in male patients, but not in female patients. A higher comorbidity burden was associated with slower improvement in HRQoL for both female and male patients. Female patients reported poorer HRQoL and their physical health improved more slowly after coronary revascularization, irrespective of comorbidity burden. Higher comorbidity burden was associated with poorer physical health and disease-specific HRQoL in male patients only. Our results indicate that female and male patients recover differently after coronary revascularization. These findings highlight the importance of comorbidity- and gender-specific approaches for evaluating coronary artery disease and coronary revascularization procedures."
https://openalex.org/W3035836531,"Canada implemented a series of laws regulating firearms including background and psychological screening, licensing, and training in the years 1991, 1994, and 2001. The effects of this legislation on suicide and homicide rates were examined over the years 1981 to 2016. Models were constructed using difference-in-difference analysis of firearms and non firearms death rates from 1981 to 2016. In addition, negative binomial regression was used to test for an association between rates of suicide by Canadian Province and firearms prevalence, using licensing rates as a proxy for prevalence. No associated benefit from firearms legislation on aggregate rates of male suicide was found. In men aged 45 to 59 an associated shift from firearms suicide after 1991 and 1994 to an increase in hanging resulted in overall rate ratios of 0.994 (95%CI, 0.978,1.010) and 0.993 (95%CI, 0.980,1.005) respectively. In men 60 and older a similar effect was seen after 1991, 1994, and 2001, that resulted in rate ratios of 0.989 (95%CI, 0.971,1.008), 0.994 (95%CI, 0.979,1.010), and 1.010 (95%CI, 0.998,1.022) respectively. In females a similar effect was only seen after 1991, rate ratio 0.983 (95%CI, 0.956,1.010). No beneficial association was found between legislation and female or male homicide rates. There was no association found with firearm prevalence rates per province and provincial suicide rates, but an increased association with suicide rates was found with rates of low income, increased unemployment, and the percentage of aboriginals in the population. In conclusion, firearms legislation had no associated beneficial effect on overall suicide and homicide rates. Prevalence of firearms ownership was not associated with suicide rates. Multifaceted strategies to reduce mortality associated with firearms may be required such as steps to reduce youth gang membership and violence, community-based suicide prevention programs, and outreach to groups for which access to care may be a particular issue, such as Aboriginals."
https://openalex.org/W3035965982,"Grinding is the last and most important process of parts processing, the purpose is to achieve high precision and surface roughness. Therefore, grinding machine has the characteristics of high added value, high technology content and great remanufacturing value. However, the evaluation of machine tool remanufacturing is based on imprecise and fuzzy information at present. The aim of this study is to present the remanufacturing evaluation for feasibility and comprehensive benefit of retired grinder. Firstly, according to the unique structure of grinder, the feasibility evaluation model of grinder remanufacturing is established, including technical feasibility criterion, economic feasibility criterion and resource environment feasibility criterion. Secondly, the comprehensive benefit evaluation model of remanufacturing grinder is established, in which the weight of each evaluation criterion is determined by Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Finally, combined with the remanufacturing case of the cylindrical grinder, the evaluation method is verified and analyzed. The results show that the remanufacturing of the waste grinding machine through the feasibility evaluation can obtain better comprehensive benefits, and the remanufacturer can get considerable benefits and reduce the potential risks in the remanufacturing process."
https://openalex.org/W3036268552,"Carbon (C) footprint of dairy production, expressed in kg C dioxide (CO2) equivalents (CO2e) (kg energy-corrected milk (ECM))-1, encompasses emissions from feed production, diet management and total product output. The proportion of pasture on diets may affect all these factors, mainly in subtropical climate zones, where cows may access tropical and temperate pastures during warm and cold seasons, respectively. The aim of the study was to assess the C footprint of a dairy system with annual tropical and temperate pastures in a subtropical region. The system boundary included all processes up to the animal farm gate. Feed requirement during the entire life of each cow was based on data recorded from Holstein × Jersey cow herds producing an average of 7,000 kg ECM lactation-1. The milk production response as consequence of feed strategies (scenarios) was based on results from two experiments (warm and cold seasons) using lactating cows from the same herd. Three scenarios were evaluated: total mixed ration (TMR) ad libitum intake, 75, and 50% of ad libitum TMR intake with access to grazing either a tropical or temperate pasture during lactation periods. Considering IPCC and international literature values to estimate emissions from urine/dung, feed production and electricity, the C footprint was similar between scenarios, averaging 1.06 kg CO2e (kg ECM)-1. Considering factors from studies conducted in subtropical conditions and actual inputs for on-farm feed production, the C footprint decreased 0.04 kg CO2e (kg ECM)-1 in scenarios including pastures compared to ad libitum TMR. Regardless of factors considered, emissions from feed production decreased as the proportion of pasture went up. In conclusion, decreasing TMR intake and including pastures in dairy cow diets in subtropical conditions have the potential to maintain or reduce the C footprint to a small extent."
https://openalex.org/W3036634063,"Talents are not only an important strategic resource for promoting regional development but also a core element for maintaining competitiveness. We organize the evaluation index system of regional talent attraction into the following four aspects: regional development, industry development, income and regional environment. Combined with the talent possession of 31 provinces (cities) from 2010 to 2018, we establish a regression equation of the relationship between the evaluation index and talent possession by using a stepwise regression and the Bayesian prior function. Simultaneously, we apply the spatial autocorrelation analysis method to measure the correlation and agglomeration degree of the talent attraction level of provinces and municipalities in China. The results reveal the following. (1) From 2010 to 2018, the talent attractiveness level of China's provinces shows a steady upward trend with an average annual growth rate of 5.804%. The regional environment has the highest score, and the income level has the lowest score. (2) The level of talent attraction in China shows a decreasing trend from east to west, and the ranking in 2018 was ""East Coast > North Coast > Southern Coast > Middle Yangtze River > Middle Yellow River > Southwest > Northeast > Greater Northwest"". The trend of spatial agglomeration is apparent and gradually increases over the years. The numbers of hot and cold spots are relatively large and concentrated in the eastern coast and western region, respectively. (3) The level of economic development, quality of people's life, and level of the development of the tertiary industry have a great impact on the attractiveness of talents. Talents also pay more attention to regional medical, education and transportation indicators. These research results can provide some guidance and references for the formulation of talent introduction policies in various provinces and municipalities."
https://openalex.org/W3036848877,"Background Although many studies have focused on leisure time physical activity (LTPA), household physical activity (HPA) can contribute to health benefits. This study aimed to compare LTPA and HPA patterns and to examine the association of these types of activities with the risk of mortality in Korea. Methods A total of 125,299 participants 40 to 69 years old and enrolled in the Health Examinees (HEXA) study from 2004 to 2012 were included in this study. The sex-specific LTPA and HPA categories were defined based on a questionnaire. A multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the LTPA and HPA correlates. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of all-cause mortality were estimated using the Cox proportional hazard model. Results Overall, the LTPA and HPA patterns differed by age, income, and history of chronic diseases. LTPA reduced the risk of death, and lower risks were observed in more time spent engaged in or a vigorous LTPA intensity. The subjects who participated only in HPA and were not involved in LTPA also had lower risks of mortality (HR = 0.72, 95% CIs: 0.60–0.85 for men, and HR = 0.84, 95% CIs: 0.69–1.02 for women) than those who did not participate in both LTPA and HPA. Conclusions HPA reduced the risks of mortality in middle-aged Korean adults and could even decrease the risk of death in those who did not participate in LTPA."

The lesion area was semi-automatically delineated, and a total of 488 texture features were respectively extracted from precontrast, postcontrast, and subtraction images. The Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was performed to identify statistically significant features between different HER2 2+ amplification groups. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to search for the optimal feature subsets. Three machine learning classifiers, logistic regression analysis (LRA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and support vector machine (SVM), were used with a leave-one-out cross validation method to establish the classification models of HER2 2+ status. Classification performance was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.Based on the texture analysis with SVM model, the areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) were 0.890 for subtraction images, 0.736 for postcontrast images, and 0.672 for precontrast images, respectively. For LRA model, the AUCs were 0.884, 0.733, and 0.623, respectively. For QDA model, the AUCs were 0.831, 0.726, and 0.568, respectively. LRA and the SVM model with subtraction images reached significantly better performance than the QDA model (P = 0.0227 and P = 0.0088, respectively).Texture features of breast cancer extracted from DCE-MRI are associated with HER2 2+ status. Additional studies are necessary to confirm the present preliminary findings."
https://openalex.org/W3036025042,"Lung volume is modulated by sensory afferent feedback via vagal and spinal pathways. The purpose of this study was to systematically alter afferent feedback with and without a mechanical challenge (chest compression). We hypothesized that manipulation of afferent feedback by nebulization of lidocaine, extra-thoracic vagotomy, or lidocaine administration to the pleural space would produce differential effects on the motor pattern of breathing during chest compression in sodium pentobarbital anesthetized rats (N = 43). Our results suggest that: 1) pulmonary stretch receptors are not the sole contributor to breathing feedback in adult male and female rats; 2) of our manipulations, chest compression had the largest effect on early expiratory diaphragm activity (""yield""); 3) reduction of spinally-mediated afferent feedback modulates breathing patterns most likely via inhibition; and 4) breathing parameters demonstrate large sex differences. Compared to males, female animals had lower respiratory rates (RR), which were further depressed by vagotomy, while chest compression increased RR in males, and decreased yield in females without changing RR. Collectively, our results suggest that balance between tonic vagal inhibition and spinal afferent feedback maintains breathing characteristics, and that it is important to specifically evaluate sex differences when studying control of breathing."

The effects of seed moisture content levels (ca. 5, 8, 11%) combined with storage temperatures (-3°, -18°, -196°C) were investigated in terms of the description of seeds defined as orthodox under oxidative stress after seed storage, during germination, and initial seedling growth. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and ascorbate (Asc) were analyzed in relation to seed germinability and seedlings emergence in three species: Malus sylvestris L., Prunus avium L. and Prunus padus L. The effect of seed storage conditions on H2O2 levels appeared in germinated seeds after the third year of storage in each species. The H2O2 levels were negatively correlated with the germination and seedling emergence of P. avium seeds after three years of storage under all examined combinations. The emergence of P. padus seedlings was not linked to any of the stress markers tested. The P. padus seed biochemical traits were least altered by storage conditions, and the seeds produced tolerant seedlings of relatively high levels of H2O2 and TBARS. To cope with different H2O2 levels, TBARS levels, and Asc levels in seeds of three species varying storage conditions different molecular responses, i.e. repairing mechanisms, were applied during stratification to compensate for the storage conditions and, as a result, seeds remained viable and seedlings were successfully established."

https://openalex.org/W3036449765,"Intrauterine growth restriction is defined as a fetal weight below the 10th percentile for a given gestational age and can be identified using umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry which is a non-invasive technique. The objective of this study was to determine the perinatal outcome of growth-restricted fetuses with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler study compared to those with normal umbilical artery Doppler waveforms at a tertiary referral hospital in Ethiopia.A prospective cohort study was conducted among pregnant mothers with fetal growth restriction admitted for labour and delivery from September 2018-February 2019. The data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 23. After conducting descriptive analysis, exploring the entire data, and checking for, statistical associations between abnormal umbilical artery Doppler and outcome variables, multiple logistic regression was conducted to control for confounders.A total of 170 pregnant mothers complicated with growth-restricted fetuses were included in the study, among which 133 were with normal umbilical artery Doppler studies and 37 were with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler studies. Four (3%) of normal and 9(24.3%) of abnormal umbilical artery Doppler studies ended in perinatal death-value = 0.001. Twenty (15%) of normal and 24(64.9%) of abnormal umbilical artery Doppler study neonates required neonatal intensive care admission-value = 0.002. Growth restricted fetuses complicated with abnormal Doppler were two times more likely to require neonatal intensive care unit admissions compared to growth-restricted fetuses with normal umbilical artery Doppler flow, P-value 0.002, (OR = 2.059,95%CI 1.449-2.926). Growth restricted fetuses complicated with abnormal Doppler were four times more likely to end in early neonatal death compared to growth-restricted fetuses with normal umbilical artery Doppler flow, P-value 0.001, (OR = 4.136, 95%CI 3.423-4.998). However, the study is unmatched and there is a possibility of gestational age confounding the result and should be seen with the context of preterm morbidity and mortality.The abnormal umbilical artery Doppler waveform is associated with cesarean section delivery, neonatal intensive care unit admission, respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal sepsis, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, and early neonatal death compared to normal umbilical artery Doppler flow."
https://openalex.org/W3036728713,"Maize, a main crop worldwide, establishes a mutualistic symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi providing nutrients to the roots from soil volumes which are normally not in reach of the non-colonized root. The mycorrhizal phosphate uptake pathway (MPU) spans from extraradical hyphae to root cortex cells housing fungal arbuscules and promotes the supply of phosphate to the mycorrhizal host in exchange for photosynthetic carbon. This symbiotic association with the mycobiont has been shown to affect plant host nutritional status and growth performance. However, whether and how the MPU affects the root microbial community associated with mycorrhizal hosts in association with neighboring plants, remains to be demonstrated. Here the maize germinal Mu transposon insertion mutant pht1;6, defective in mycorrhiza-specific Pi transporter PHT1;6 gene, and wild type B73 (wt) plants were grown in mono- and mixed culture and examined under greenhouse and field conditions. Disruption of the MPU in pht1;6 resulted in strongly diminished growth performance, in reduced P allocation to photosynthetic source leaves, and in imbalances in leaf elemental composition beyond P. At the microbial community level a loss of MPU activity had a minor effect on the root-associated fungal microbiome which was almost fully restricted to AM fungi of the Glomeromycotina. Moreover, while wt grew better in presence of pht1;6, pht1;6 accumulated little biomass irrespective of whether it was grown in mono- or mixed culture and despite of an enhanced fungal colonization of its roots in co-culture with wt. This suggested that a functional MPU is prerequisite to maintain maize growth and that neighboring plants competed for AM fungal Pi in low P soil. Thus future strategies towards improving yield in maize populations on soils with low inputs of P fertilizer could be realized by enhancing MPU at the individual plant level while leaving the root-associated fungal community largely unaffected."
https://openalex.org/W3036009825,"Trawl-caught Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) often yield highly variable fillet quality that may be related to capture stress. To investigate mechanisms involved in causing variable quality, commercial-sized (3.5±0.9 kg) Atlantic cod were swum to exhaustion in a large swim tunnel and subsequently exposed to extreme crowding (736±50 kg m-3) for 0, 1 or 3 hours in an experimental cod-end. The fish were then recuperated for 0, 3 or 6 hours in a net pen prior to slaughter to assess the possibility to reverse the reduced fillet quality. We found that exhaustive swimming and crowding were associated with increased metabolic stress, as indicated by increased plasma cortisol, blood lactate and blood haematocrit levels, accompanied by reduced quality of the fillets due to increased visual redness and lower initial muscle pH. The observed negative effects of exhaustive swimming and crowding were only to a small degree reversed within 6 hours of recuperation. The results from this study suggest that exhaustive swimming followed by extreme crowding can reduce fillet quality, as measured by fillet redness and muscle pH, and contribute to the variable fillet quality seen in trawl-caught Atlantic cod. Recuperation for more than six hours may be required to reverse these effects."
https://openalex.org/W3036224265,"Tobacco use after lung transplantation is associated with adverse outcome. Therefore, active smoking is regarded as a contraindication for lung transplantation and should be excluded prior to placement on the waiting list. The aim of the study was to compare self-reporting with a systematic cotinine based screening approach to identify patients with active nicotine abuse. Nicotine use was systematically assessed by interviews and cotinine test in all lung transplant candidates at every visit in our center. Patients were classified according to the stage prior to transplantation and cotinine test results were compared to self-reports and retrospectively analyzed until June 2019. Of 620 lung transplant candidates, 92 patients (14.8%) had at least one positive cotinine test. COPD as underlying disease (OR 2.102, CI 1.110–3.981; p = 0.023), number of pack years (OR 1.014, CI 1.000–1.028; p = 0.047) and a time of cessation less than one year (OR 2.413, CI 1.410–4.128; p = 0.001) were associated with a positive cotinine test in multivariable regression analysis. The majority of non-COPD patients (n = 13, 72.2%) with a positive test had a cessation time of less than one year. 78 patients (84.7%) falsely declared not consuming any nicotine-based products prior to the test. Finally, all never smokers were test negative. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that active nicotine use is prevalent in transplant candidates with a high prevalence of falsely declaring nicotine abstinence. COPD was the main diagnosis in affected patients. Short cessation time and a high number of pack years are risk factors for continued nicotine abuse."
https://openalex.org/W3036025270,"The acute phase response is a highly conserved reaction to infection, inflammation, trauma, stress, and neoplasia. Acute phase assays are useful for wildlife health assessment, however, they are infrequently utilized in reptiles. This study evaluated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in eastern (Terrapene carolina carolina) and ornate box turtles (Terrapene ornata ornata) and hemoglobin-binding protein (HBP) in T. ornata. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate in 90 T. carolina and 105 T. ornata was negatively associated with packed cell volume and was greater in unhealthy turtles (p < 0.05). Female T. ornata had higher ESR values than males (p < 0.05). Measurement of ESR with a microhematocrit tube proportionally overestimated values from a commercial kit (Winpette), though both methods may retain utility with separate reference intervals. Hemoglobin-binding protein concentration in 184 T. ornata was significantly increased in adults and unhealthy turtles (p < 0.05). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate values were similar between seasons and populations, and HBP values were consistent between years, indicating that these analytes may have more stable baseline values than traditional health metrics in reptiles. This study demonstrates that ESR and HBP are promising diagnostics for health assessment in wild box turtles. Incorporating these tests into wild herptile health assessment protocols may support conservation efforts and improve ecosystem health monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W3036101558,"The alternative mechanical theory of glaucoma, in which an increased pressure difference across the lamina cribrosa (difference between intraocular and intracranial pressure; IOP and ICP), rather than solely an elevated IOP, leads to structural and functional vision loss, is still controversial. If the theory is true, a drug that simultaneously lowers both the IOP and ICP may be ineffective. The aim of this study was to determine how acetazolamide (AAZ; a drug prescribed in glaucoma that aims to lower the IOP) affects both IOP and ICP in glaucoma patients and to compare the magnitude and time course of the induced pressure changes with those of healthy subjects not taking AAZ. IOP and noninvasive ICP (measured through emissions from the ear) were measured in 20 glaucoma patients taking 125 mg of AAZ twice daily. Measurements were taken for 30 minutes before taking the drug and for 2 hours post-ingestion. Comparisons were made with 13 age-similar controls. After 12 hours with no anti-glaucoma medication, AAZ did not further reduce IOP in glaucoma patients compared to controls (P = 0.58) but did reduce ICP compared to controls (P = 0.035), by approximately 4 mmHg. Our findings suggest that there are periods during the day when the pressure difference across the lamina cribrosa is larger in case of AAZ use. Future studies should focus on improving the noninvasive ICP testing, different doses and dosing schedules of AAZ, and the time course of IOP in glaucoma patients not taking AAZ."
https://openalex.org/W3036163161,"The drastic decline of bees is associated with several factors, including the immune system suppression due to the increased exposure to pesticides. A widely used method to evaluate these effects on these insects' immune systems is the counting of circulating hemocytes in the hemolymph. However, the extraction of hemolymph from larvae is quite difficult, and the collected material is frequently contaminated with other tissues and gastrointestinal fluids, which complicates counting. Therefore, the present work established a high quality and easily reproducible method of extracting hemolymph from honeybee larvae (Apis mellifera), the extraction with ophthalmic scissors. Extraction methods with the following tools also were tested: 30G needle, fine-tipped forceps, hypodermic syringe, and capillaries tubes. The hemolymph was obtained via an incision on the larvae's right side for all methods, except for the extraction with ophthalmic scissors, in which the hemolymph was extracted from the head region. To assess the purity of the collected material, turbidity analyses of the samples using a turbidimeter were proposed, tested, and evaluated. The results showed that the use of ophthalmic scissors provided the clearest samples and was free from contamination. A reference range between 22,432.35 and 24,504.87 NTU (nephelometric turbidity units) was established, in which the collected samples may be considered of high quality and free from contamination."
https://openalex.org/W3036252830,"Deer overabundance is a contributing factor in the degradation of plant communities and ecosystems worldwide. The management and conservation of the deer-affected ecosystems requires us to urgently grasp deer population trends and to identify the factors that affect them. In this study, we developed a Bayesian state–space model to estimate the population dynamics of sika deer (Cervus nippon) in a cool-temperate forest in Japan, where wolves (Canis lupus hodophilax) are extinct. The model was based on field data collected from block count surveys, road count surveys by vehicles, mortality surveys during the winter, and nuisance control for 12 years (2007–2018). We clarified the seasonal and annual fluctuation of the deer population. We found a peak of deer abundance (2010) over 12 years. In 2011 the estimated deer abundance decreased drastically and has remained at a low level then. The deer abundance gradually increased from April to December during 2013–2018. The seasonal fluctuation we detected could reflect the seasonal migration pattern of deer and the population recruitment through fawn births in early summer. In our model, snowfall accumulation, which can be a lethal factor for deer, may have slightly affected their mortality during the winter. Although we could not detect a direct effect of snow on population dynamics, snowfall decrease due to global warming may decelerate the winter migration of deer; subsequently, deer staying on-site may intensively forage evergreen perennial plants during the winter season. The nuisance control affected population dynamics. Even in wildlife protection areas and national parks where hunting is regulated, nuisance control could be effective in buffering the effect of deer browsing on forest ecosystems."

We have demonstrated benefit of SSAO inhibition in acute kidney fibrosis. However the function of SSAO in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is yet to be determined. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of a SSAO inhibitor (SSAOi; PXS-4728A) as an antifibrotic agent using a diabetic model of CKD. Diabetic mice were treated with SSAOi for 24 weeks and outcomes compared with untreated diabetic mice and telmisartan treated animals as a standard of care comparator. Extracellular matrix markers, fibronectin and oxidative stress, were downregulated in diabetic mice treated with SSAOi compared with untreated diabetic mice. Expression of the pan-leukocyte marker CD45 was also supressed by SSAOi. SSAO inhibition in diabetic mice resulted in a significant reduction in glomerulosclerosis and associated albuminuria compared to untreated diabetic mice. However, the effect of SSAO inhibition was less obvious in the tubulointerstitial compartment than in the glomeruli. Therefore, SSAO may be a potential target for diabetic glomerulosclerosis."

Phase variation is the high frequency, random, reversible switching of gene expression that allows bacteria to adapt to different host microenvironments and evade host defences, and is most commonly mediated by simple DNA sequence repeats. Bioinformatic analysis of five closed M. catarrhalis genomes identified 17 unique simple DNA sequence repeat tracts that were variable between strains, indicating the potential to mediate phase variable expression of the associated genes. Assays designed to assess simple sequence repeat variation under conditions mimicking host infection demonstrated that phase variation of uspA1 (ubiquitous surface protein A1) from high to low expression occurs over 72 hours of biofilm passage, while phase variation of uspA2 (ubiquitous surface protein A2) to high expression variants occurs during repeated exposure to human serum, as measured by mRNA levels. We also identify and confirm the variable expression of two novel phase variable genes encoding a Type III DNA methyltransferase (modO), and a conserved hypothetical permease (MC25239_RS00020). These data reveal the repertoire of phase variable genes mediated by simple sequence repeats in M. catarrhalis and demonstrate that modulation of expression under conditions mimicking human infection is attributed to changes in simple sequence repeat length."
https://openalex.org/W3036534877,"There is increasing evidence that clinical trial participants are uninformed about the trials in which they participate, raising ethical concerns regarding informed consent. The aim of this pilot study was to explore clinical trial participants' use of consent discussions and information sheets when considering participating in clinical trials research. A qualitative, interview-based pilot study was designed in order to elicit, through dialogue, details of the reasons for participants' use of, and preferences regarding, different modes of information provision. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with two different groups of patients who were participants in the Reinforcement of Closure of Stoma Site trial. The first group comprised newly-consented trial participants, who had been recruited up to 72 hours before our interview; the second group comprised patients attending a follow-up clinic 12 months after joining the trial. Thirteen participants were recruited in total: three newly-consented patients, and ten follow-up patients. The study found that participants' use of consent discussions to gain information about clinical trials was varied, and that they only minimally used information sheets after providing initial consent for the trial. Participants demonstrated varying degrees of knowledge about the trial, with some having forgotten that they were still involved in the trial. Participants reported a high level of trust in medical staff as a reason for not seeking more information about the trial. Some participants reported dissatisfaction with the timing of information provision. Some were amenable to novel ways of receiving trial information, such as web-based methods. The pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of a larger study into the provision of information to prospective clinical trial participants. The results suggest that considering alternative ways of providing information and the appropriateness of existing information provision may be acceptable to and useful for potential trial participants."
https://openalex.org/W3036770836,"We have previously reported on HIV-1 infected patients who fail anti-retroviral therapy but manage to re-suppress without a regimen change despite harbouring major drug resistance mutations. Here we explore phenotypic drug resistance in such patients in order to better understand this phenomenon. Patients (n = 71) failing a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen, but who subsequently re-suppressed on the same regimen, were assessed for HIV-1 genotypic drug resistance through Sanger sequencing. A subset (n = 23) of these samples, as well as genotypically matched samples from patients who did not re-suppress (n = 19), were further assessed for phenotypic drug resistance in an in vitro single cycle assay. Half of the patients (n = 36/71, 51%) harboured genotypic drug resistance, with M184V (n = 18/36, 50%) and K103N (n = 16/36, 44%) being the most prevalent mutations. No significant difference in the median time to re-suppression (31-39 weeks) were observed for either group (p = 0.41). However, re-suppressors with mutant virus rebounded significantly earlier than those with wild-type virus (16 vs. 33 weeks; p = 0.014). Similar phenotypic drug resistance profiles were observed between patients who re-suppressed and patients who failed to re-suppress. While most remained susceptible to stavudine (d4T) and zidovudine (AZT), both groups showed a reduced susceptibility to 3TC and NNRTIs. HIV- 1 infected patients on an NNRTI-based regimen can achieve viral re-suppression on the same regimen despite harbouring viruses with genotypic and phenotypic drug resistance. However, re-suppression was less durable in those with resistance, reinforcing the importance of appropriate regimen choices, ongoing viral load monitoring and adherence counselling."
https://openalex.org/W3035789467,"In view of the strong nonlinear characteristics of the multi-packet transmission Aero-engine DCS with induced delay and random packet dropout, a neural network PID approach law sliding-mode controller using sliding window strategy and multi-kernel LS-SVM packet dropout online compensation is proposed. Firstly, the time-delay term in the system model is transformed equivalently, to establish the discrete system model of multi-packet transmission without time-delay; furthermore, the construction of multi-kernel function is transformed into kernel function coefficient optimization, and the optimization problem can be solved by the chaos adaptive artificial fish swarm algorithm, then the online predictive compensation will be made for data packet dropout of multi-packet transmission through the sliding window multi-kernel LS-SVM. After that, a sliding-mode controller design method of proportional integral differential approach law based on neural network is proposed. And online adjustment of PID approach law parameters can be achieved by nonlinear mapping of neural network. Finally, Truetime is used to simulate the method. The results shows that when the packet dropout rate is 30% and 60%, the average error of packet dropout prediction of multi-kernel LS-SVM reduces 29.21% and 44.66% compared with that of combined kernel LS-SVM, and the chattering amplitude of the proposed neural network PID approach law sliding-mode controller is decreased compared with other five approach law methods respectively. This controller can ensure a fast response speed, which shows that this method can achieve a better tracking control of the aeroengine network control system."
https://openalex.org/W3036378660,"Fluorescent proteins that modulate their emission intensities when protonated serve as excellent probes of the cytosolic pH. Since the total fluorescence output fluctuates significantly due to variations in the fluorophore levels in cells, eliminating the dependence of the signal on protein concentration is crucial. This is typically accomplished with the aid of ratiometric fluorescent proteins such as pHluorin. However, pHluorin is excited by blue light, which can complicate pH measurements by adversely impacting bacterial physiology. Here, we characterized the response of intensity-based, pH-sensitive fluorescent proteins that excite at longer wavelengths where the blue light effect is diminished. The pH-response was interpreted in terms of an analytical model that assumed two emission states for each fluorophore: a low intensity protonated state and a high intensity deprotonated state. The model suggested a scaling to eliminate the dependence of the signal on the expression levels as well as on the illumination and photon-detection settings. Experiments successfully confirmed the scaling predictions. Thus, the internal pH can be readily determined with intensity-based fluorophores with appropriate calibrations irrespective of the fluorophore concentration and the signal acquisition setup. The framework developed in this work improves the robustness of intensity-based fluorophores for internal pH measurements in E. coli, potentially extending their applications."
https://openalex.org/W3035834249,"Influenza-associated mortality has not been quantified in the Philippines. Here, we constructed multiple negative binomial regression models to estimate the overall and age-specific excess mortality rates (EMRs) associated with influenza in the Philippines from 2006 to 2015. The regression analyses used all-cause mortality as the dependent variable and meteorological controls, time, influenza A and B positivity rates (lagged for up to two time periods), and annual and semiannual cyclical seasonality controls as independent variables. The regression models closely matched observed all-cause mortality. Influenza was estimated to account for a mean of 5,347 excess deaths per year (1.1% of annual all-cause deaths) in the Philippines, most of which (67.1%) occurred in adults aged ≥60 years. Influenza A accounted for 85.7% of all estimated excess influenza deaths. The annual estimated influenza-attributable EMR was 5.09 (95% CI: 2.20–5.09) per 100,000 individuals. The EMR was highest for individuals aged ≥60 years (44.63 [95% CI: 4.51–44.69] per 100,000), second highest for children aged less than 5 years (2.14 [95% CI: 0.44–2.19] per 100,000), and lowest for individuals aged 10 to 19 years (0.48 [95% CI: 0.10–0.50] per 100,000). Estimated numbers of excess influenza-associated deaths were considerably higher than the numbers of influenza deaths registered nationally. Our results suggest that influenza causes considerable mortality in the Philippines–to an extent far greater than observed from national statistics–especially among older adults and young children."
https://openalex.org/W3036122487,"Very young children (under 2 years old) have high risk for influenza-related complications. Children 6 months or older in the US are recommended to receive influenza vaccination annually, yet uptake is substantially lower than other routinely-recommended vaccines. Existing nationally-representative studies on very young child influenza vaccine uptake has several limitations: few examine provider-verified influenza vaccination (relying on parental report), few contain parental vaccine attitudes variables (known to be crucial to vaccine uptake), and none to our knowledge consider intersectionality of social disadvantage nor how influenza vaccine determinants differ from those of other recommended vaccines. This nationally-representative study examines provider-verified data on 7,246 children aged 6-23 months from the most recent (2011) National Immunization Survey to include the restricted Parental Concerns module, focusing on children up-to-date on a series of vaccines (the 4:3:1:3:3:1:4 series) but not influenza vaccines (""hidden vulnerability to influenza""). About 71% of children were up-to-date on the series yet only 33% on influenza vaccine recommendations by their second birthday; 44% had hidden vulnerability to influenza. Independent of parental history of vaccine refusal and a myriad of health services use factors, no parental history of delaying vaccination was associated with 7.5% (2.6-12.5) higher probability of hidden vulnerability to influenza despite being associated with 15.5% (10.8-20.2) lower probability of being up-to-date on neither the series nor influenza vaccines. Thus, parental compliance with broad child vaccine recommendations and lack of vaccine hesitancy may not indicate choice to vaccinate children against influenza. Examination of intersectionality suggests that maternal college education may not confer improved vaccination among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic children despite that it does for non-Hispanic White children. Policymakers and researchers from public health, sociology, and other sectors need to collaborate to further examine how vaccine hesitancy and intersectional social disadvantage interact to affect influenza vaccine uptake in young US children."
https://openalex.org/W3036388139,"This study investigated the developmental paths in the use of audiovisual information for the perception of emotions and phonemes by Japanese speakers. Children aged 5 to 12 years and adults aged 30 to 39 years engaged in an emotion perception task in which speakers expressed their emotions through their faces and voices, and a phoneme perception task using phonemic information in speakers' lip movements and speech sounds. Results indicated that Japanese children's judgement of emotions by using auditory information increased with increasing age, whereas the use of audiovisual information for judging phonemes remained constant with increasing age. Moreover, adults were affected by visual information more than children. We discuss whether these differences in developmental patterns are due to differential integration processes for information indicative of emotions and phonemes, as well as possible cultural / linguistic reasons for these differences."
https://openalex.org/W3036487309,"A new method to evaluate archaeological wetland sites in a more objective way was tested. Different wetland environments have been sampled in areas of a nature reserve and their macroremain content analysed to build a modern analogue dataset. This dataset was then used to characterise archaeological samples from a navigation channel from the Roman port city Lattara. In the modern analogue samples, the different wetland types (saline/brackish or fresh water) could be differentiated in the correspondence analysis. Within these groups, the sampled area of the littoral (submerged, shoreline, unsubmerged) could also be differentiated. This dataset can therefore provide a basis for the interpretation of the nature and degree of aquatic influence and layer formation processes in archaeobotanical records of coastal sites. In the tested archaeological samples from the navigation channel of Lattara, changes in space and time could be tracked using the modern analogue dataset and geoarchaeological information. The channel lost its fresh water supply and silted up over a short period of time (approx. 100 years)."
https://openalex.org/W3036558212,"Wrist-worn sleep actigraphs are limited for evaluating sleep, especially in sleepers who lie awake in bed without moving for extended periods. Sleep logs depend on the accuracy of perceiving and remembering times of being awake. Here we evaluated pressing an event-marker button while lying awake under two conditions: self-initiated pressing every 5 to 10 minutes or pressing when signaled every 5 minutes by a vibration pulse from a wristband. We evaluated the two conditions for acceptability and their concordance with actigraphically scored sleep.Twenty-nine adults wore actigraphs on six nights. On nights 1 and 4, they pressed the marker to a vibration signal, and on nights 2 and 5, they self-initiated presses without any signal. On nights 3 and 6, they were told not to press the marker. Every morning they filled out a sleep log about how they had slept.The vibration band was unacceptable to 42% of the participants, who judged it too disturbing to their sleep. Self-initiated pressing was acceptable to all, although it reduced log reported sleep depth compared to a no pressing condition. Estimations of sleep onset latency were considerably longer by button pressing than by actigraphy. Agreement of epoch-by-epoch sleep scoring by actigraphy and by button pressing was poor (kappa = 0.23) for self-initiated pressing and moderate (kappa = 0.46) for pressing in response to a vibration.Self-initiated button pressing to indicate being awake while lying in bed is acceptable to many, interferes little with sleep, and adds substantially to the information given by actigraphy."
