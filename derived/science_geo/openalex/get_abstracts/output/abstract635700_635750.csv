https://openalex.org/W2955231772,"The ability to predict the impact of cis-regulatory sequences on gene expression would facilitate discovery in fundamental and applied biology. Here we combine polysome profiling of a library of 280,000 randomized 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) with deep learning to build a predictive model that relates human 5' UTR sequence to translation. Together with a genetic algorithm, we use the model to engineer new 5' UTRs that accurately direct specified levels of ribosome loading, providing the ability to tune sequences for optimal protein expression. We show that the same approach can be extended to chemically modified RNA, an important feature for applications in mRNA therapeutics and synthetic biology. We test 35,212 truncated human 5' UTRs and 3,577 naturally occurring variants and show that the model predicts ribosome loading of these sequences. Finally, we provide evidence of 45 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) associated with human diseases that substantially change ribosome loading and thus may represent a molecular basis for disease."
https://openalex.org/W2955073764,"Background Malaysia is widely credited to have achieved universal health coverage for citizens. However, the accessibility of healthcare services to migrant workers is questionable. Recently, medical fees for foreigners at public facilities were substantially increased. Mandatory health insurance only covers public hospital admissions and excludes undocumented migrants. This study explores barriers to healthcare access faced by documented and undocumented migrant workers in Malaysia. Methods We use qualitative data from 17 in-depth interviews conducted with key informants from civil society organisations, trade unions, academia, medical professionals, as well as migrant workers and their representatives. We interviewed doctors working in public hospitals and private clinics frequented by migrants. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results We found that healthcare services in Malaysia are often inaccessible to migrant workers. Complex access barriers were identified, many beyond the control of the health sector. Major themes include affordability and financial constraints, the need for legal documents like valid passports and work permits, language barriers, discrimination and xenophobia, physical inaccessibility and employer-related barriers. Our study suggests that government mandated insurance for migrant workers is insufficient in view of the recent increase in medical fees. The perceived close working relationship between the ministries of health and immigration effectively excludes undocumented migrants from access to public healthcare facilities. Language barriers may affect the quality of care received by migrant workers, by inadvertently resulting in medical errors, while preventing them from giving truly informed consent. Conclusions We propose instituting migrant-friendly health services at public facilities. We also suggest implementing a comprehensive health insurance to enable healthcare access and financial risk protection for all migrant workers. Non-health sector solutions include the formation of a multi-stakeholder migration management body towards a comprehensive national policy on labour migration which includes health."
https://openalex.org/W2954099113,"In this manuscript, we compare two commonly used methods to perform cortical mapping based on myelination of the human neocortex. T1w/T2w and R1 maps with matched total acquisition times were obtained from a young cohort in randomized order and using a test–retest design. Both methodologies showed cortical myelin maps that enhanced similar anatomical features, namely primary sensory regions known to be myelin rich. T1w/T2w maps showed increased robustness to movement artifacts in comparison to R1 maps, while the test re-test reproducibility of both methods was comparable. Based on Brodmann parcellation, both methods showed comparable variability within each region. Having parcellated cortical myelin maps into VDG11b areas of 4a, 4p, 3a, 3b, 1, 2, V2, and MT, both methods behave identically with R1 showing an increased variability between subjects. In combination with the test re-test evaluation, we concluded that this increased variability between subjects reflects relevant tissue variability. A high level of correlation was found between the R1 and T1w/T2w regions with regions of higher deviations being co-localized with those where the transmit RF field deviated most from its nominal value. We conclude that R1 mapping strategies might be preferable when studying different population cohorts where cortical properties are expected to be altered while T1w/T2w mapping will have advantages when performing cortical based segmentation."
https://openalex.org/W2954186886,"Robust inventories are vital for improving assessment of and response to deadly and costly landslide hazards. However, collecting landslide events in inventories is difficult at the global scale due to inconsistencies in or the absence of landslide reporting. Citizen science is a valuable opportunity for addressing some of these challenges. The new Cooperative Open Online Landslide Repository (COOLR) supplements data in a NASA-developed Global Landslide Catalog (GLC) with citizen science reports to build a more robust, publicly available global inventory. This manuscript introduces the COOLR project and its methods, evaluates the initial citizen science results from the first 13 months, and discusses future improvements to increase the global engagement with the project. The COOLR project (https://landslides.nasa.gov) contains Landslide Reporter, the first global citizen science project for landslides, and Landslide Viewer, a portal to visualize data from COOLR and other satellite and model products. From March 2018 to April 2019, 49 citizen scientists contributed 162 new landslide events to COOLR. These events spanned 37 countries in five continents. The initial results demonstrated that both expert and novice participants are contributing via Landslide Reporter. Citizen scientists are filling in data gaps through news sources in 11 different languages, in-person observations, and new landslide events occurring hundreds and thousands of kilometers away from any existing GLC data. The data is of sufficient accuracy to use in NASA susceptibility and hazard models. COOLR continues to expand as an open platform of landslide inventories with new data from citizen scientists, NASA scientists, and other landslide groups. Future work on the COOLR project will seek to increase participation and functionality of the platform as well as move towards collective post-disaster mapping."
https://openalex.org/W2954902734,"Background The transition from high school to university life is a critical time for change, often accompanied by the adoption of negative lifestyle habits including unhealthy nutrition. The purpose of this longitudinal study was to identify sex-specific changes in dietary intake and diet quality, and associated changes in body weight and composition during first-year university. Methods Three-hundred and one students (n = 229 females) completed food frequency questionnaires, and had their body weight, body composition, waist and hip circumference measured at the beginning and end of first-year university. Repeated-measures ANOVAs with covariate adjustments were used with variables for sex (between group) and time (within group) to assess these changes. Results Students gained body weight and fat during the year (p<0.001). Body mass Index (BMI) also significantly increased (p = 0.032). Males gained more weight (Male:3.8 kg; Female:1.8 kg), fat mass (Male:2.7 kg; Female:1.5 kg), lean mass (Male:1.1 kg; Female:0.3 kg) and BMI (Male:1.2 kg/m2; Female:0.7 kg/m2; p≤0.001 for interactions), and had greater increases in waist circumference (Male:2.7 cm; Female:1.1 cm) and waist:hip ratio (Male:0.02; Female:0.004; p<0.05 for interactions) than females. Energy intake remained the same over the year in both sexes, accompanied by an increase in alcohol (ethanol) in both sexes but more so in males than females (p = 0.011 interaction). Diet quality decreased, characterized by a reduced intake of healthy foods/beverages (p<0.05) in both sexes such as yogurt, cheese, oatmeal, breads, rice, pasta, vegetables, green salad, fruits, steak, fish, nuts and milk, and an increased consumption of unhealthy foods and beverages (p<0.05) such as donuts/cakes, fried chicken, beer and liquor. Significant interactions between sexes indicated that males displayed a more adverse and lower quality eating pattern which included greater intakes of donuts/cakes, fried chicken, beer and liquor, as well as decreased intakes of eggs and vegetables compared to females. Lastly, some dietary intake changes significantly correlated with fat mass and waist circumference change indicating that poor dietary choices were associated with increased adiposity. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that during first-year university, both male and female students undergo unfavorable changes in nutrition and body weight/composition that significantly differ between sexes, with males showing more adverse changes. Our results can be used to inform effective sex-specific strategies and interventions to improve dietary habits during the transition to university life."

We tested the role of GPR37 in the ischemic brain of GPR37 knockout (KO) mice, exploring the idea that GPR37 might be protective against ischemic damage. In an ischemic stroke model, GPR37 KO mice exhibited increased infarction and cell death compared with wild-type (WT) mice, measured by 2,3,5-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride and TUNEL staining 24 h after stroke. Moreover, more severe functional deficits were detected in GPR37 KO mice in the adhesive-removal and corner tests. In the peri-infarct region of GPR37 KO mice, there was significantly more apoptotic and autophagic cell death accompanied by caspase-3 activation and attenuated mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling. GPR37 deletion attenuated astrocyte activation and astrogliosis compared with WT stroke controls 24-72 h after stroke. Immunohistochemical staining showed more ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1-positive cells in the ischemic cortex of GPR37 KO mice, and RT-PCR identified an enrichment of M1-type microglia or macrophage markers in the GPR37 KO ischemic cortex. Western blotting demonstrated higher levels of inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α in GPR37-KO mice after ischemia. Thus, GPR37 plays a multifaceted role after stroke, suggesting a novel target for stroke therapy.-McCrary, M. R., Jiang, M. Q., Giddens, M. M., Zhang, J. Y., Owino, S., Wei, Z.

https://openalex.org/W2954654225,"Background Stable coronary artery disease (CAD) is known to have an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Serum albumin (Alb) is reported as a useful risk-stratification tool in cardiovascular diseases such as acute coronary syndrome or heart failure. However, the association between Alb and stable CAD is unclear. Thus, we aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of Alb in patients with stable CAD. Methods and results We analyzed the data of all patients admitted to Shinonoi General Hospital between October 2014 and October 2017 for newly diagnosed stable CAD, treated via elective percutaneous coronary intervention, with the exception of old myocardial infarction. We collected data, including Alb, at admission. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiac events (MACE; defined as all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke). In 204 enrolled patients (median age, 73 years), during a median follow-up of 783 days, 28 experienced MACE. Alb was significantly lower in patients with MACE than in those without (p<0.001). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, low Alb predicted worse prognosis in MACE (p<0.001). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, low Alb levels independently predicted MACE (p<0.001) after adjusting for age and sex (HR 4.128 [95% CI 1.632–10.440], p = 0.003), or, age and C-reactive protein (HR 3.373 [95% CI 1.289–8.828], p = 0.013). Conclusions Low Alb levels predicted MACE in patients with stable CAD."
https://openalex.org/W2954371073,"Introduction Despite vaccination, there were more than 100,000 annual cases of varicella in the United States in 2013–2014. Individuals at highest risk of developing severe or complicated varicella include immunocompromised people, preterm infants, and pregnant women. Varicella zoster immune globulin (human) (VARIZIG) is recommended by the CDC for postexposure prophylaxis to prevent or attenuate varicella-zoster virus infection in high-risk individuals. Contemporary information on administration of VARIZIG is limited. Methods This open-label, expanded-access program provided VARIZIG to physician-identified, high-risk participants exposed to varicella. Participants included immunocompromised children/adults, infants (preterm, newborns whose mothers had varicella onset within 5 days before or 2 days after delivery, and those aged <1 year), and pregnant women. VARIZIG (125 IU/10 kg [up to 625 IU]) was administered intramuscularly, ideally within 96 hours, but up to 10 days, postexposure. Incidence of varicella rash and severity (>100 pox, pneumonia, or encephalitis) were assessed up to 42 days after administration. Results The varicella outcome population (n = 507) included 263 immunocompromised participants (32 adults, 231 children), 137 pregnant women, 105 infants, and 2 healthy adults with no history of varicella. Varicella incidence was 4.5% in immunocompromised participants, 7.3% in pregnant women, and 11.5% in infants. The incidence of varicella was similar when comparing VARIZIG administration ≤ 96 hours vs > 96 hours (up to 10 days) postexposure in the entire population (6.2% vs. 9.4%, respectively), and also in each subgroup. Of 34 participants with varicella, 5 developed > 100 pox and 1 developed pneumonia and encephalitis. There were no product-related deaths and only 1 serious adverse event (serum sickness) considered probably related to VARIZIG. Conclusion Postexposure administration of VARIZIG was associated with low rates of varicella in high-risk participants, regardless of when administered within 10 days postexposure. VARIZIG was well-tolerated and safe in high-risk participants."
https://openalex.org/W2955913628,"Endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of LPS-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). Endothelial cells (ECs) acquired a fibroblast-like phenotype and contributed to myofibroblast generation through the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) process. Of note, human adult renal stem/progenitor cells (ARPCs) enhance the tubular regenerative mechanism during AKI but little is known about their effects on ECs. Following LPS exposure, ECs proliferated, decreased EC markers CD31 and vascular endothelial Cadherin, and up-regulated myofibroblast markers, collagen I, and vimentin. The coculture with ARPCs normalized the EC proliferation rate and abrogated the LPS-induced EndMT. The gene expression analysis showed that most of the genes modulated in LPS-stimulated ARPCs belong to cell activation and defense response pathways. We showed that the ARPC-specific antifibrotic effect is exerted by the secretion of CXCL6, SAA4, and BPIFA2 produced after the anaphylatoxin stimulation. Next, we investigated the molecular signaling that underlies the ARPC protective mechanism and found that renal progenitors diverge from differentiated tubular cells and ECs in myeloid differentiation primary response 88–independent pathway activation. Finally, in a swine model of LPS-induced AKI, we observed that activated ARPCs secreted CXCL6, SAA4, and BPIFA2 as a defense response. These data open new perspectives on the treatment of both sepsis- and endotoxemia-induced AKI, suggesting an underestimated role of ARPCs in preventing endothelial dysfunction and novel strategies to protect the endothelial compartment and promote kidney repair.—Sallustio, F., Stasi, A., Curci, C., Divella, C., Picerno, A., Franzin, R., De Palma, G., Rutigliano, M., Lucarelli, G., Battaglia, M., Staffieri, F., Crovace, A., Pertosa, G.

https://openalex.org/W2955733329,"Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) is a stress protein, and can be hyper-produced by many kinds of cells after exposure to injury or disease conditions. In this study, we asked whether LCN2 may play a protective role in cerebral endothelium. After focal cerebral ischemia in rats, plasma levels of LCN2 were significantly elevated at 6, 12, and 24 hrs, and persisted until 3 days post-stroke. To assess the vascular mechanisms of LCN2, we used brain endothelial cell cultures to investigate its effects on neutrophil adhesion and endothelial barrier integrity. LCN2 did not affect neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells either under normal conditions or after TNFα stimulation. TNFα significantly increased endothelial permeability, and LCN2 rescued endothelial permeability. Concomitantly, LCN2 restored the membrane distribution of the tight junction protein ZO-1 and the adherens junction protein VE-cadherin. Our findings suggest that elevated LCN2 in the blood after ischemic stroke might affect endothelial function, in part by reducing damage to endothelial junctional proteins and maintain blood-brain barrier integrity."

https://openalex.org/W2955390600,"Immunological synapse (IS) formation between a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell is accompanied by the reorientation of the T cell centrosome toward the interface. This polarization response is thought to enhance the specificity of T cell effector function by enabling the directional secretion of cytokines and cytotoxic factors toward the antigen-presenting cell. Centrosome reorientation is controlled by polarized signaling through diacylglycerol (DAG) and protein kinase C (PKC). This drives the recruitment of the motor protein dynein to the IS, where it pulls on microtubules to reorient the centrosome. Here, we used T cell receptor photoactivation and imaging methodology to investigate the mechanisms controlling dynein accumulation at the synapse. Our results revealed a remarkable spatiotemporal correlation between dynein recruitment to the synaptic membrane and the depletion of cortical filamentous actin (F-actin) from the same region, suggesting that the two events were causally related. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that pharmacological disruption of F-actin dynamics in T cells impaired both dynein accumulation and centrosome reorientation. DAG and PKC signaling were necessary for synaptic F-actin clearance and dynein accumulation, while calcium signaling and microtubules were dispensable for both responses. Taken together, these data provide mechanistic insight into the polarization of cytoskeletal regulators and highlight the close coordination between microtubule and F-actin architecture at the IS."
https://openalex.org/W2953646530,"Non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovars continue to be an important food safety issue worldwide. Cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait) fruits possess antimicrobial properties due to their various acids and phenolic compounds; however, the underlying mechanism of actions is poorly understood. We evaluated the effects of cranberry extracts on the growth rate of Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium, Enteritidis and Heidelberg and on the transcriptomic profile of Salmonella Enteritidis to gain insight into phenotypic and transcriptional changes induced by cranberry extracts on this pathogen. An ethanolic extract from cranberry pomaces (KCOH) and two of its sub-fractions, anthocyanins (CRFa20) and non-anthocyanin polyphenols (CRFp85), were used. The minimum inhibitory (MICs) and bactericidal (MBCs) concentrations of these fractions against tested pathogens were obtained using the broth micro-dilution method according to the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute’s guidelines. Transcriptional profiles of S. Enteritidis grown in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented with or without 2 or 4 mg/ml of KCOH were compared by RNASeq to reveal gene modulations serving as markers for biological activity. The MIC and MBC values of KCOH were 8 and 16 mg/mL, respectively, against all tested S. enterica isolates. The MIC value was 4 mg/mL for both CRFa20 and CRFp85 sub-fractions, and a reduced MBC value was obtained for CRFp85 (4 mg/ml). Treatment of S. Enteritidis with KCOH revealed a concentration-dependent transcriptional signature. Compared to the control, 2 mg/ml of KCOH exposure resulted in 89 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which 53 and 36 were downregulated and upregulated, respectively. The upregulated genes included those involved in citrate metabolism, enterobactin synthesis and transport, and virulence. Exposure to 4 mg/ml KCOH led to the modulated expression of 376 genes, of which 233 were downregulated and 143 upregulated, which is 4.2 times more DEGs than from exposure to 2 mg/ml KCOH. The downregulated genes were related to flagellar motility, Salmonella Pathogenicity Island-1 (SPI-1), cell wall/membrane biogenesis, and transcription. Moreover, genes involved in energy production and conversion, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, and coenzyme transport and metabolism were upregulated during exposure to 4 mg/ml KCOH. Overall, 57 genes were differentially expressed (48 downregulated and 9 upregulated) in response to both concentrations. Both concentrations of KCOH downregulated expression of hilA, which is a major SPI-1 transcriptional regulator. This study provides information on the response of Salmonella exposed to cranberry extracts, which could be used in the control of this important foodborne pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2954881946,"Recent reports suggest that the Hippo signaling pathway influences ovarian follicle development; however, its exact roles remain unknown. Here, we examined the ovarian functions of the Hippo kinases large tumor suppressors (LATS)1 and 2, which serve to inactivate the transcriptional coactivators Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). Inactivation of Lats1/2 in murine granulosa cells either in vitro or in vivo resulted in a loss of granulosa cell morphology, function, and gene expression. Mutant cells further underwent changes in structure and gene expression suggestive of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and transdifferentiation into multiple lineages. In vivo, granulosa cell-specific loss of Lats1/2 caused the ovarian parenchyma to be mostly replaced by bone tissue and seminiferous tubule-like structures. Transdifferentiation into Sertoli-like cells and osteoblasts was attributed in part to the increased recruitment of YAP and TAZ to the promoters of sex-determining region Y box 9 and bone γ-carboxyglutamate protein, key mediators of male sex determination and osteogenesis, respectively. Together, these results demonstrate for the first time a critical role for Lats1/2 in the maintenance of the granulosa cell genetic program and further highlight the remarkable plasticity of granulosa cells.-Tsoi, M., Morin, M., Rico, C., Johnson, R. L., Paquet, M., Gévry, N., Boerboom, D. Lats1 and Lats2 are required for ovarian granulosa cell fate maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2953932303,"Casein kinase 2 (CK2) is a tetrameric protein kinase composed of 2 catalytic (α and α') and 2 regulatory β subunits. Our study provides the first molecular and cellular characterization of the different CK2 subunits, highlighting their individual roles in skeletal muscle specification and differentiation. Analysis of C2C12 cell knockout for each CK2 subunit reveals that: 1) CK2β is mandatory for the expression of the muscle master regulator myogenic differentiation 1 in proliferating myoblasts, thus controlling both myogenic commitment and subsequent muscle-specific gene expression and myotube formation; 2) CK2α is involved in the activation of the muscle-specific gene program; and 3) CK2α' activity regulates myoblast fusion by mediating plasma membrane translocation of fusogenic proteins essential for membrane coalescence, like myomixer. Accordingly, CK2α' overexpression in C2C12 cells and in mouse regenerating muscle is sufficient to increase myofiber size and myonuclei content via enhanced satellite cell fusion. Consistent with these results, pharmacological inhibition of CK2 activity substantially blocks the expression of myogenic markers and muscle cell fusion both in vitro in C2C12 and primary myoblasts and in vivo in mouse regenerating muscle and zebrafish development. Overall, our work describes the specific and coordinated functions of CK2 subunits in orchestrating muscle differentiation and fusogenic activity, highlighting CK2 relevance in the physiopathology of skeletal muscle tissue.-Salizzato, V., Zanin, S., Borgo, C., Lidron, E., Salvi, M., Rizzuto, R., Pallafacchina, G., Donella-Deana, A.

https://openalex.org/W2954189797,"Background and aims Liver fibrosis is characterized by the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) leading to impaired function and cirrhosis. Previous reports support a role for cadherin-11 (CDH11) in regulating the development of dermal and pulmonary fibrosis. In the current report, the extent to which CDH11 modulates the development of liver fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCL4) was assessed. Methods Wild type (WT) and CDH11 deficient (CDH11-/-) mice were treated with CCl4 or vehicle control for 8 weeks to induce liver fibrosis. Liver fibrosis was assessed by histology, collagen content, and RTPCR of fibrotic mediators. Results Livers from WT mice treated with CCl4 had increased levels of CDH11 which localized to injured hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells, and macrophages. Interestingly, CDH11-/- mice had decreased histological evidence of liver fibrosis, collagen deposition, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) accumulation, and mRNA levels of fibrotic mediators such as Col1-α1, Snail, TGF-β and IL-6. Conclusions These data demonstrate that CDH11 is increased during liver fibrosis, is an important regulator of liver fibrosis induced by CCL4 and suggest that CDH11 may be a potential therapeutic target for liver fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2955953126,"Ecoregionalization is the process by which a territory is classified in similar areas according to specific environmental and climatic factors. The climate and the environment strongly influence the presence and distribution of vectors responsible for significant human and animal diseases worldwide. In this paper, we developed a map of the eco-climatic regions of Italy adopting a data-driven spatial clustering approach using recent and detailed spatial data on climatic and environmental factors. We selected seven variables, relevant for a broad set of human and animal vector-borne diseases (VBDs): standard deviation of altitude, mean daytime land surface temperature, mean amplitude and peak timing of the annual cycle of land surface temperature, mean and amplitude of the annual cycle of greenness value, and daily mean amount of rainfall. Principal Component Analysis followed by multivariate geographic clustering using the k-medoids technique were used to group the pixels with similar characteristics into different ecoregions, and at different spatial resolutions (250 m, 1 km and 2 km). We showed that the spatial structure of ecoregions is generally maintained at different spatial resolutions and we compared the resulting ecoregion maps with two datasets related to Bluetongue vectors and West Nile Disease (WND) outbreaks in Italy. The known characteristics of Culicoides imicola habitat were well captured by 2/22 specific ecoregions (at 250 m resolution). Culicoides obsoletus/scoticus occupy all sampled ecoregions, according to its known widespread distribution across the peninsula. WND outbreak locations strongly cluster in 4/22 ecoregions, dominated by human influenced landscape, with intense cultivations and complex irrigation network. This approach could be a supportive tool in case of VBDs, defining pixel-based areas that are conducive environment for VBD spread, indicating where surveillance and prevention measures could be prioritized in Italy. Also, ecoregions suitable to specific VBDs vectors could inform entomological surveillance strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2954272163,"The human multidrug resistance protein 1 (hMRP1) transporter is implicated in cancer multidrug resistance as well as immune responses involving its physiologic substrate, glutathione (GSH)-conjugated leukotriene C4 (LTC4). LTC4 binds a bipartite site on hMRP1, which a recent cryoelectron microscopy structure of LTC4-bound bovine Mrp1 depicts as composed of a positively charged pocket and a hydrophobic (H) pocket that binds the GSH moiety and surrounds the fatty acid moiety, respectively, of LTC4. Here, we show that single Ala and Leu substitutions of H-pocket hMRP1-Met1093 have no effect on LTC4 binding or transport. Estrone 3-sulfate transport is also unaffected, but both hMRP1-Met1093 mutations eliminate estradiol glucuronide transport, demonstrating that these steroid conjugates have binding sites distinct from each other and from LTC4. To eliminate LTC4 transport by hMRP1, mutation of 3 H-pocket residues was required (W553/M1093/W1246A), indicating that H-pocket amino acids are key to the vastly different affinities of hMRP1 for LTC4vs. GSH alone. Unlike organic anion transport, hMRP1-mediated drug resistance was more diminished by Ala than Leu substitution of Met1093. Although our findings generally support a structure in which H-pocket residues bind the lipid tail of LTC4, their critical and differential role in the transport of conjugated estrogens and anticancer drugs remains unexplained.-Conseil, G., Arama-Chayoth, M., Tsfadia, Y., Cole, S.

Pregnant women were randomized into a treatment (home visits, baby massage, and parenting program, n = 115) or control (n = 118) group (trial registration: ISRCTN04631728). The home environment was assessed at 6 months, 1½, and 3 years using the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (responsiveness, acceptance, organization, learning material, involvement, variety). Cognitive skills were assessed at 5 years using the British Ability Scales. Emotional problems were teacher-reported at 5 years using the Short Early Development Inventory. Latent growth modeling was used to model changes in the home environment, and mediation analyses to test whether those changes explained children outcomes. Compared to controls, treatment children were exposed to more stimulating environments in terms of learning material (B = -1.62, p = 0.036) and environmental variety (B = -1.58, p = 0.009) at 6 months, but these differences faded at 3 years. Treatment families were also more likely to accept suboptimal child behaviors without using punishment (acceptance score, B = 1.49, p = 0.048) and were more organized at 3 years (B = 1.08, p = 0.033). None of the changes mediated children's outcomes. In conclusion, we found that the program positively impacted different home environment dimensions, but these changes did not account for improvements in children's outcomes. Exploratory analyses suggest that the impact of improvements in the home environment on child outcomes may be limited to specific groups of children. Limitations of the study include the potential lack of generalizability to other populations, the inability to assess the individual treatment components, and sample size restrictions which precluded a moderated mediation analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2953998221,"A major challenge for stem cell engineering is achieving a holistic understanding of the molecular networks and biological processes governing cell differentiation. To address this challenge, we describe a computational approach that combines gene expression analysis, previous knowledge from proteomic pathway informatics and cell signaling models to delineate key transitional states of differentiating cells at high resolution. Our network models connect sparse gene signatures with corresponding, yet disparate, biological processes to uncover molecular mechanisms governing cell fate transitions. This approach builds on our earlier CellNet and recent trajectory-defining algorithms, as illustrated by our analysis of hematopoietic specification along the erythroid lineage, which reveals a role for the EGF receptor family member, ErbB4, as an important mediator of blood development. We experimentally validate this prediction and perturb the pathway to improve erythroid maturation from human pluripotent stem cells. These results exploit an integrative systems perspective to identify new regulatory processes and nodes useful in cell engineering."

Several methods for measuring CR are presented and their conceptual and methodological assumptions are assessed. More specifically, at the individual risk level, we examined the implications of various measurement approaches (i.e., dichotomous, proportion- and z-scores). At the composite level, we measured CR as an observed score, and compared this approach with two variable-centered approaches (consisting of reflective and formative indicators) and two person-centered approaches (consisting of latent class analysis and latent profile analysis). A decision tree was proposed to aid researchers in comparing and choosing the alternative methods. Using a sample of 169 low-income families (children approximately 5 years old, 51% girls; 74% African American, and their primary caregiver), we specified models to represent each of the alternative methods. Across models, the multiple risk composite was based on a set of 12 individual risk indicators including low maternal education, hunger, meal and money unpredictability, maternal psychopathology, maternal substance use, harsh parenting, family stress, and family violence. For each model, we estimated the effect size of the composite CR variable on children’s externalizing problems. Results indicated that the variable-centered CR composites had larger effects than the observed summary score CR indices and the person-centered methods."
https://openalex.org/W2953867717,"Diatoms are the most diverse lineage of algae, but the diversity of their chloroplast genomes, particularly within a genus, has not been well documented. Herein, we present three chloroplast genomes from the genus Halamphora (H. americana, H. calidilacuna, and H. coffeaeformis), the first pennate diatom genus to be represented by more than one species. Halamphora chloroplast genomes ranged in size from ~120 to 150 kb, representing a 24% size difference within the genus. Differences in genome size were due to changes in the length of the inverted repeat region, length of intergenic regions, and the variable presence of ORFs that appear to encode as-yet-undescribed proteins. All three species shared a set of 161 core features but differed in the presence of two genes, serC and tyrC of foreign and unknown origin, respectively. A comparison of these data to three previously published chloroplast genomes in the non-pennate genus Cyclotella (Thalassiosirales) revealed that Halamphora has undergone extensive chloroplast genome rearrangement compared to other genera, as well as containing variation within the genus. Finally, a comparison of Halamphora chloroplast genomes to those of land plants indicates diatom chloroplast genomes within this genus may be evolving at least ~4–7 times faster than those of land plants. Studies such as these provide deeper insights into diatom chloroplast evolution and important genetic resources for future analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2955398786,"Cardiac fibroblasts (CF) play a critical role in post-infarction remodeling which can ultimately lead to pathological fibrosis and heart failure. Recent evidence demonstrates that remote (non-infarct) territory fibrosis is a major mechanism for ventricular dysfunction and arrhythmogenesis. β-arrestins are important signaling molecules involved in β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) desensitization and can also mediate signaling in a G protein independent fashion. Recent work has provided evidence that β-arrestin signaling in the heart may be beneficial, however, these studies have primarily focused on cardiac myocytes and their role in adult CF biology has not been well studied. In this study, we show that β-arrestins can regulate CF biology and contribute to pathological fibrosis. Adult male rats underwent LAD ligation to induce infarction and were studied by echocardiography. There was a significant decline in LV function at 2–12 weeks post-MI with increased infarct and remote territory fibrosis by histology consistent with maladaptive remodeling. Collagen synthesis was upregulated 2.9-fold in CF isolated at 8 and 12 weeks post-MI and β-arrestin expression was significantly increased. β-adrenergic signaling was uncoupled in the post-MI CF and β-agonist-mediated inhibition of collagen synthesis was lost. Knockdown of β-arrestin1 or 2 in the post-MI CF inhibited transformation to myofibroblasts as well as basal and TGF-β-stimulated collagen synthesis. These data suggest that β-arrestins can regulate CF biology and that targeted inhibition of these signaling molecules may represent a novel approach to prevent post-infarction pathological fibrosis and the transition to HF."
https://openalex.org/W2955901650,"PLC-β exerts biologic influences through GPCR. GPCRs are involved in regulating glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Previous studies have suggested that PLC-βs might play an important role in pancreatic β cells. However, because of a lack of the specific inhibitors of PLC-β isozymes and appropriate genetic models, the in vivo function of specific PLC-β isozymes in pancreatic β cells and their physiologic relevance in the regulation of insulin secretion have not been studied so far. The present study showed that PLC-β1 was crucial for β-cell function by generation of each PLC-β conditional knockout mouse. Mice lacking PLC-β1 in β cells exhibited a marked defect in GSIS, leading to glucose intolerance. In ex vivo studies, the secreted insulin level and Ca2+ response in Plcb1f/f; pancreas/duodenum homeobox protein 1 (Pdx1)-Cre recombinase-estrogen receptor T2 (CreERt2) islets was lower than those in the Plcb1f/f islets under the high-glucose condition. PLC-β1 led to potentiate insulin secretion via stimulation of particular Gq-protein–coupled receptors. Plcb1f/f; Pdx1-CreERt2 mice fed a high-fat diet developed more severe glucose intolerance because of a defect in insulin secretion. The present study identified PLC-β1 as an important molecule that regulates β cell insulin secretion and can be considered a candidate for therapeutic intervention in diabetes mellitus.—Hwang, H.-J., Yang, Y.

In this cross-sectional study, we recruited 1 036 secondary-school students (55.3% girls). Self-reported physical fitness was assessed on a 10-point scale, with a higher score indicating better physical fitness. We measured waist circumference, sit-ups in 1 minute, standing long jump and sit-and-reach test and calculated z-scores to obtain objective physical fitness index. Boys performed better in sit-ups in 1 minute and standing long jump tests and had higher waist circumference values. Girls performed better in sit-and-reach test. Overall, boys had higher physical fitness z-score values, compared to girls. Younger boys had better physical fitness perception (r1st grade = 0.61, p<0.001), compared to older ones (r = 0.40–0.50, p<0.001). In girls, correlation coefficient was the highest in the 3rd grade (r = 0.46, p<0.001), followed by the 2ndgrade (r = 0.43, p<0.001), the 1stgrade (r = 0.41, p<0.001) and the 4th grade (r = 0.37, p<0.001).

https://openalex.org/W2953780443,"Resistance to insecticides can hamper the control of mosquitoes such as Culex quinquefasciatus, known to vector arboviruses such as West Nile virus and others. The strong selective pressure exerted on a mosquito population by the use of insecticides can result in heritable genetic changes associated with resistance. We sought to characterize genetic differences between insecticide resistant and susceptible Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes using targeted DNA sequencing. To that end, we developed a panel of 122 genes known or hypothesized to be involved in insecticide resistance, and used an Ion Torrent PGM sequencer to sequence 125 unrelated individuals from seven populations in the southern U.S. whose resistance phenotypes to permethrin and malathion were known from previous CDC bottle bioassay testing. Data analysis consisted of discovering SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) and genes with evidence of copy number variants (CNVs) statistically associated with resistance. Ten of the seventeen genes found to be present in higher copy numbers were experimentally validated with real-time PCR. Of those, six, including the gene with the knock-down resistance (kdr) mutation, showed evidence of a ≥ 1.5 fold increase compared to control DNA. The SNP analysis revealed 228 unique SNPs that had significant p-values for both a Fisher’s Exact Test and the Cochran-Armitage Test for Trend. We calculated the population frequency for each of the 64 nonsynonymous SNPs in this group. Several genes not previously well characterized represent potential candidates for diagnostic assays when further validation is conducted."
https://openalex.org/W2955214135,"In humans and mice, the detailed phenotypic and functional characterization of peripheral blood monocytes allows for identification of three monocyte subsets. There are also evidences of monocyte phenotypic heterogeneity in other species, including cattle, sheep, pig and horse. However, little is known about such variability in dogs. The aim of the study was to determine whether and how peripheral blood monocytes of healthy dogs differ in the presence of MHCII and CD4 and in the basal production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Three distinct subsets of CD11b+CD14+ monocytes were found in peripheral blood samples of healthy dogs, based on the variations in the density of MHCII and CD4 surface molecules: MHCII+CD4- (Mo1), MHCII+CD4+ (Mo2) and MHCII-CD4+ (Mo3). The Mo2 and Mo3 were significantly lower in percentage than Mo1 but their basal ROS production was higher. Within the Mo2 and Mo3 subsets, the percentage of cells producing ROS was significantly higher comparing to cells lacking this activity. Canine peripheral blood monocytes vary in the expression of MHCII and CD4 and in the activity suggesting that cells within the three identified subsets carry out different functions. The higher production of ROS in non-activated cells within small subsets of Mo2 and Mo3 monocytes might indicate their immunomodulatory potential."
https://openalex.org/W2954507453,"We investigated what factors may foster or hinder physicians’ cancer screening risk literacy–specifically the ability to understand evidence regarding screening effectiveness and make evidence-based recommendations to patients. In an experiment, physicians in training (interns and residents) read statistical information about outcomes from screening for cancer, and had to decide whether to recommend it to a patient. We manipulated the effectiveness of the screening (effective vs. ineffective at reducing mortality) and the demand of the patient to get screened (demand vs. no demand). We assessed participants’ comprehension of the presented evidence and recommendation to the patient, as well as a-priori screening beliefs (e.g., that screening is always a good choice), numeracy, science literacy, knowledge of screening statistics, statistical education, and demographics. Stronger positive a-priori screening beliefs, lower knowledge of screening statistics, and lower numeracy were related to worse comprehension of the evidence. Physicians recommended against the ineffective screening but only if they showed good comprehension of the evidence. Physicians’ recommendations were further based on the perceived benefits from screening but not on perceived harms, nor the patient’s demands. The current study demonstrates that comprehension of cancer screening statistics and the ability to infer the potential benefits for patients are essential for evidence-based recommendations. However, strong beliefs in favor of screening fostered by promotion campaigns may influence how physicians evaluate evidence about specific screenings. Fostering physician numeracy skills could help counteract such biases and provide evidence-based recommendations to patients."
https://openalex.org/W2955295291,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules that modulate gene and protein expression in hematopoiesis. Platelets are known to contain a fully functional miRNA machinery. While platelets used for transfusion are normally stored at room temperature, recent evidence suggests more favorable effects under a cold-storage condition, including higher adhesion and aggregation properties. Thus, we sought to determine whether functional differences in platelets are associated with the differential profiling of platelet miRNA expressions. To obtain the miRNA expression profile, next-generation sequencing was performed on human platelets obtained from 10 healthy subjects. The miRNAs were quantified after being stored in three different conditions: 1) baseline (before storage), 2) stored at 22°C with agitation for 72 h, and 3) stored at 4°C for 72 h. Following the identification of miRNAs by sequencing, the results were validated at the level of mature miRNAs from 18 healthy subjects, by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Differential expression was observed for 125 miRNAs that were stored at 4°C and 9 miRNAs stored at 22°C as compared to the baseline. The validation study by qPCR confirmed that storage at 4°C increased the expression levels (fold change 95% CI) of mir-20a-5p (1.87, p<0.0001), mir-10a-3p (1.88, p<0.0001), mir-16-2-3p (1.54, p<0.01), and mir-223-5p (1.38, p<0.05), compared with those of the samples stored at 22°C. These results show that miRNAs correlate with platelet quality under specific storage conditions. The data indicate that miRNAs could be potentially used as biomarkers of platelet quality."
https://openalex.org/W2954716633,"Purpose To determine the influence of residual submacular fluid (SMF) on the recovery of function and structure of the retina after successful rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) reattachment. Methods We reviewed the medical records of all patients who had undergone successful RRD repair by scleral buckling (SB) surgery or by pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) from March 2011 to August 2014. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomographic images of the macular regions were used at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months following the surgery. The best-corrected visual acuities (BCVA) were evaluated at the same times. Results The eyes with a macula-off RRD that were treated by SB surgery had a significant higher incidence of residual SMF (52%) than those treated by PPV (6.8%; P <0.001). Nevertheless, the postoperative BCVA was significantly improved in the eyes that had undergone SB surgery (P = 0.007). The postoperative BCVAs were not significantly different between the groups in which the SMF was absorbed (12 eyes) and not absorbed (13 eyes) within 1 month after the SB surgery. The photoreceptor outer segment length and the presence of a foveal bulge were not significantly different between these two groups at 12 months. Multiple regression analyses showed that the presence of a foveal bulge (β = 0.531, P = 0.001) and the duration of the retinal detachment before surgery (β = 0.465, P = 0.002) but not the duration of the SMF were independent factors significantly correlated with the final BCVA. Conclusions These results suggest that the postoperative residual SMF does not significantly disrupt the functional and structural recovery of eyes with macula-off RRD treated by SB surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2954813922,"Higher levels of religiousness are associated with better mental health outcomes, but most of previous research is cross-sectional, failing to address issues of selection and reverse causation.We assessed the longitudinal association between both public and private religiousness and depressive symptoms, drawing on data from 7,719 persons aged 65 and older of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). Repeated measurements of different aspects of religiousness and depressive symptoms were used in random and fixed-effects models in order to assess the effect of changes in religious behavior on changes in depressive symptoms.Praying more than once a day was associated with more depressive symptoms (β = 0.150, 95% CI: 0.003, 0.298) relative to individuals who never pray, adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics, physical health covariates and history of depression, but the comparison with the fixed effects model suggests that this is the result of a selection effect. Participating weekly or more in a religious organization was associated with fewer depressive symptoms (β = -0.219, 95% CI: -0.344, -0.094), but this appeared to be spurious after taking due account of possible confounders (β = -0.092, 95% CI: -0.223, 0.038). Focusing on within-persons changes, we found that participating in religious organizations weekly or more was associated with more depressive symptoms (β = 0.275, 95% CI: 0.075, 0.475).Our findings do not support that religious behavior, both public or private, may be beneficial for the mental health of older Europeans."
https://openalex.org/W2955226481,"Bile acid diarrhea (BAD) is common with ileal resection, Crohn's disease, and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Here, we demonstrate the efficacy of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) inhibitor (R)-benzopyrimido-pyrrolo-oxazine-dione-27 (BPO-27) in reducing bile acid-induced fluid and electrolyte secretion in colon. Short-circuit current measurements in human T84 colonic epithelial cells and planar colonic enteroid cultures showed a robust secretory response following mucosal but not serosal addition of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) or its taurine conjugate, which was fully blocked by CFTR inhibitors, including (R)-BPO-27. (R)-BPO-27 also fully blocked CDCA-induced secretory current in murine colon. CFTR activation by CDCA primarily involved Ca2+ signaling. In closed colonic loops in vivo, luminal CDCA produced a robust secretory response, which was reduced by ~70% by (R)-BPO-27 or in CFTR-deficient mice. In a rat model of BAD produced by intracolonic infusion of CDCA, (R)-BPO-27 reduced the elevation in stool water content by >55%. These results implicate CFTR activation in the colon as a major prosecretory mechanism of CDCA, a bile acid implicated in BAD, and support the potential therapeutic efficacy of CFTR inhibition in bile acid-associated diarrheas.—Duan, T., Cil, O., Tse, C.

We sought to describe care utilization and mortality following an index hospitalization for people with HIV in South Africa. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study among hospitalized patients admitted to medicine wards at a single hospital serving a large catchment area. Participants were followed to 6 months post-discharge. Hospital records were used to describe overall admission numbers and inpatient mortality. Poisson regression was used to assess for associations between readmission or death and independent variables. Results Of 124 enrolled participants, 121 lived to hospital discharge. At the time of discharge the median length of stay of sampled patients was 5.5 days and 105 (87%) participants were referred for follow-up, most within 2 weeks of discharge. By 6 months post-discharge, only 18% of participants had attended the clinic to which they were referred and within the referred timeframe; 64 (53%) had been readmitted at least once and 31 (26%) had died. Self-reported skipping care due to difficulty in access (relative risk 1.3, p = 0.02) and not attending follow-up care on time or at the scheduled clinic or not attending clinic at all (relative risk 1.8 and 2.4, respectively, p = 0.001) were associated with readmission or mortality. Conclusions The post-hospital period is a period of medical vulnerability and high mortality. Improving post-hospital retention in care may reduce post-hospital mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2953614725,"Although the biochemical signaling events in area CA1 of the hippocampus underlying memory acquisition, consolidation, retrieval, and extinction have been extensively studied, little is known about the activity dynamics of hippocampal neurons in CA1 during Pavlovian fear conditioning. Here, we use fiber-optic confocal microscopy coupled with the calcium indicator GCaMP6m to monitor neuron activity in freely moving mice during trace fear conditioning. We show that the activity of a group of CA1 neurons increases not only after the stimulus presentations, but also during the stimulus-free trace period when the conditioned mice exhibit a high level of freezing behavior. Therefore, we designate these cells “trace cells”. Interestingly, the activity of the trace cells increases in response to the conditioned stimuli during memory retrieval but diminishes during memory extinction. Importantly, the dynamics of neuron activity exhibit a high degree of correlation with the freezing behavior of the mice, suggesting that a neuronal ensemble responsible for encoding the trace fear memory is repeatedly reactivated during memory retrieval and later extinguished during memory extinction."
https://openalex.org/W2956127339,"Grapevine (Vitis vinifera) is one of the most important perennial crop plants in worldwide. Understanding of developmental processes like flowering, which impact quality and quantity of yield in this species is therefore of high interest. This gets even more important when considering some of the expected consequences of climate change. Earlier bud burst and flowering, for example, may result in yield loss due to spring frost. Berry ripening under higher temperatures will impact wine quality. Knowledge of interactions between a genotype or allele combination and the environment can be used for the breeding of genotypes that are better adapted to new climatic conditions. To this end, we have generated a list of more than 500 candidate genes that may play a role in the timing of flowering. The grapevine genome was exploited for flowering time control gene homologs on the basis of functional data from model organisms like A. thaliana. In a previous study, a mapping population derived from early flowering GF.GA-47-42 and late flowering 'Villard Blanc' was analyzed for flowering time QTLs. In a second step we have now established a workflow combining amplicon sequencing and bioinformatics to follow alleles of selected candidate genes in the F1 individuals and the parental genotypes. Allele combinations of these genes in individuals of the mapping population were correlated with early or late flowering phenotypes. Specific allele combinations of flowering time candidate genes within and outside of the QTL regions for flowering time on chromosome 1, 4, 14, 17, and 18 were found to be associated with an early flowering phenotype. In addition, expression of many of the flowering candidate genes was analyzed over consecutive stages of bud and inflorescence development indicating functional roles of these genes in the flowering control network."
https://openalex.org/W2953460955,"In the rat, oxytocin (OT) produces dose-dependent diuretic and natriuretic responses. Post-translational enzymatic conversion of the OT biosynthetic precursor forms both mature and C-terminally extended peptides. The plasma concentrations of these C-terminally extended peptides (OT-G; OT-GK and OT-GKR) are elevated in newborns and pregnant rats. Intravenous injection of OT-GKR to rats inhibits diuresis, whereas injection of amidated OT stimulates diuresis. Since OT and OT-GKR show different effects on the urine flow, we investigated whether OT-GKR modulates renal action by inhibition of the arginine-vasopressin (AVP) receptor V2 (V2R), the receptor involved in renal water reabsorption. Experiments were carried out in the 8-week-old Wistar rats receiving intravenous (iv) injections of vehicle, OT, OT-GKR or OT+OT-GKR combination. OT (10 μmol/kg) increased urine outflow by 40% (P<0.01) and sodium excretion by 47% (P<0.01). Treatment with OT-GKR (10 μmol/kg) decreased diuresis by 50% (P<0.001), decreased sodium excretion by 50% (P<0.05) and lowered potassium by 42% (P<0.05). OT antagonist (OTA) reduced diuresis and natriuresis exerted by OT, whereas the anti-diuretic effect of OT-GKR was unaffected by OTA. The treatment with V2R antagonist (V2A) in the presence and absence of OT induced diuresis, sodium and potassium outflow. V2A in the presence of OT-GKR only partially increased diuresis and natriuresis. Autoradiography and molecular docking analysis showed potent binding of OT-GKR to V2R. Finally, the release of cAMP from CHO cells overexpressing V2 receptor was induced by low concentration of AVP (EC50:4.2e-011), at higher concentrations of OT (EC50:3.2e-010) and by the highest concentrations of OT-GKR (EC50:1.1e-006). OT-GKR potentiated cAMP release when combined with AVP, but blocked cAMP release when combined with OT. These results suggest that OT-GKR by competing for the OT renal receptor (OTR) and binding to V2R in the kidney, induces anti-diuretic, anti-natriuretic, and anti-kaliuretic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2956048373,"There is limited physiological information on onset of puberty in male lions. The aim of this study was to use longitudinal non-invasive monitoring to: 1) assess changes in steroid metabolite excretory patterns as a function of age and body weight; 2) determine correlations between fecal androgen (FAM) and glucocorticoid (FGM) metabolite concentrations; and 3) confirm spermiogenesis non-invasively through urinalysis. Specifically, FAM and FGM metabolites were analyzed in samples collected twice weekly from 21 male lions at 17 institutions (0.9–16 years of age) for 3.8 months– 2.5 years to assess longitudinal hormone patterns. In addition, body weights were obtained approximately monthly from 10 individuals at five zoos (0.0–3.0 years), and urine was collected from six males at two facilities (1.2–6.3 years) and evaluated for the presence of spermatozoa. An increase in overall mean FAM occurred at 2.0 years of age, at which point concentrations remained similar throughout adulthood. The onset of puberty occurred earlier in captive-born males (<1.2 years of age) compared to wild-born counterparts (<2.5 years of age). Additionally, males in captivity gained an average of 7.3 kg/month compared to 3.9 kg/month for wild males over the first 2–2.5 years of age. Sperm (spermaturia) was observed in males as young as 1.2 years in captivity compared to 2.5 years in the wild (ejaculates). There was no difference in FAM or FGM concentrations with regards to age or season. Overall, this study demonstrates that: 1) captive male lions attain puberty at an earlier age than wild counterparts; 2) onset of puberty is influenced by body weight (growth rate); and 3) spermiogenesis can be confirmed via urinalysis. Knowledge about the linkage between body weight and onset of puberty could facilitate improved reproductive management of ex situ populations via mitigating the risk of unintended breedings in young animals."
https://openalex.org/W2954270916,"Background Specific tools have been recently developed to map atrial fibrillation (AF) and help guide ablation. However, when used in clinical practice, panoramic AF maps generated from multipolar intracardiac electrograms have yielded conflicting results between centers, likely due to their complexity and steep learning curve, thus limiting the proper assessment of its clinical impact. Objectives The main purpose of this trial was to assess the impact of online training on the identification of AF driver sites where ablation terminated persistent AF, through a standardized training program. Extending this concept to mobile health was defined as a secondary objective. Methods An online database of panoramic AF movies was generated from a multicenter registry of patients in whom targeted ablation terminated non-paroxysmal AF, using a freely available method (Kuklik et al–method A) and a commercial one (RhythmView–method B). Cardiology Fellows naive to AF mapping were enrolled and randomized to training vs no training (control). All participants evaluated an initial set of movies to identify sites of AF termination. Participants randomized to training evaluated a second set of movies in which they received feedback on their answers. Both groups re-evaluated the initial set to assess the impact of training. This concept was then migrated to a smartphone application (App). Results 12 individuals (median age of 30 years (IQR 28–32), 6 females) read 480 AF maps. Baseline identification of AF termination sites by ablation was poor (40%±12% vs 42%±11%, P = 0.78), but similar for both mapping methods (P = 0.68). Training improved accuracy for both methods A (P = 0.001) and B (p = 0.012); whereas controls showed no change in accuracy (P = NS). The Smartphone App accessed AF maps from multiple systems on the cloud to recreate this training environment. Conclusion Digital online training improved interpretation of panoramic AF maps in previously inexperienced clinicians. Combining online clinical data, smartphone apps and other digital resources provides a powerful, scalable approach for training in novel techniques in electrophysiology."

In rat stroke models, SPG stimulation results in increased cerebral blood flow, reduced infarct volume, protects the blood brain barrier, and improved neurological outcome. We present here the results of a prospective, multinational, single-arm, feasibility study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and potential benefit of SPG stimulation inpatients with acute ischemic stroke(AIS).Patients with anterior AIS, baseline NIHSS 7-20 and ability to initiate treatment within 24h from stroke onset, were implanted and treated with the SPG stimulation. Patients were followed up for 90 days. Effect was assessed by comparing the patient outcome to a matched population from the NINDS rt-PA trial placebo patients.Ninety-eight patients were enrolled (mean age 57years, mean baseline NIHSS 12 and mean treatment time from stroke onset 19h). The observed mortality rate(12.2%), serious adverse events (SAE)incidence(23.5%) and nature of SAE were within the expected range for the population. The modified intention to treat cohort consisted of 84 patients who were compared to matched patients from the NINDS placebo arm. Patients treated with SPG stimulation had an average mRS lower by 0.76 than the historical controls(CMH test p = 0.001).The implantation procedure and the SPG stimulation, initiated within 24hr from stroke onset, are feasible, safe, and tolerable.

https://openalex.org/W2953819140,"Effective perpetrator programmes should be embedded within a community response, engage all types of perpetrators and involve an educational approach that integrates the survivor’s voice. The Domestic Abuse Prevention Partnership (DAPP) is a transformative partnership based in the UK that aims to provide an integrated approach for perpetrators and survivors. This pragmatic mixed methods study was conducted to examine the baseline characteristics and individual outcomes of the main perpetrator programme within the DAPP. Applying a triangulation design, routine police re-offending aggregated data, pre- and post- perpetrator programme questionnaires, in-depth interviews with survivors, and focus-group discussions with perpetrators (clients) were integrated. Statistical analysis and thematic analysis were applied to quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. The majority of clients (47%) referred through the DAPP (n = 228) described wanting to make their relationship better as the main reason for engaging with the main perpetrators programme. Post-perpetrator programme questionnaires identified positive changes in both emotional behaviours and physical behaviours amongst clients, which were also supported by examples of improved relationships with their children described in survivor interviews. Three themes were described: first, making positive progress; second, impact of the children’s module; and concerns around sustaining new behaviours. Over the monitoring period, 1 in 5 clients were either suspected or convicted of domestic abuse crimes following the programme. This suggests that further maintenance of positive behaviours and reinforcements are required for some clients. Given that clients felt children were a strong motivating factor for completing a programme, it seemed paradoxical that no specialist services were made available for them. Future reiterations of the DAPP model should at least address how best to work with children in families where domestic abuse occurs."

Up to now, eleven genotypes have been identified however, their clinical significance remains unclear. Here, we investigated the presence of SAFV in asymptomatic patients admitted for adenoidectomy. A total of 70 adenoid tissue samples were collected from children with clinical symptoms caused by hypertrophy of adenoids but without symptoms of airway infection. Samples were investigated for SAFV by RT-nested PCR and sequence analysis. Eleven of 70 (15.7%) samples were positive for SAFV. Nasopharyngeal swabs were available from 45 children just before surgery. SAFV was rarely found and only in children with SAFV-positive adenoids 2/8. Our findings indicate that the presence of SAFV seems to be more frequent in adenoid tissue than expected. This could support the notion of a longer than previously anticipated persistence of SAFV nucleic acids in the respiratory tract and possibly a chronic infection. Further investigations are necessary to establish the role of SAFV infection in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2955284488,"Introduction Verbal autopsy (VA) is a useful tool for evaluating causes of death, especially in places with limited or no vital registration systems. The Population Health Metrics Research Consortium (PHMRC) developed a validated questionnaire and a set of automated methods to determine the cause of death from a VA. However, the application of these methods needs to be tested in a community environment. Objective To estimate cause-specific mortality fractions (CSMFs) using VAs and compare them against those obtained in the vital statistics of the state of Hidalgo, Mexico. Methods A random sample of deaths occurred in 2009 was selected from vital statistics in the state of Hidalgo. The full PHMRC validated VA instrument was applied to the relatives of the deceased, and the cause of death was determined using Tariff's automated method. The causes of death were grouped into 34 causes for adults, 21 for children and 6 for newborns. Results were compared with cause of death on death certificates for all deaths. Results A total of 1,198 VAs were analyzed. The Tariff method was not able to assign a cause of death in only 9% of adults, 2% of children and 7% of neonatal deaths. The CSMFs obtained from the Tariff method were similar in some cases to those of vital statistics (e.g. cirrhosis), but different in others (e.g. sepsis). Conclusion The application of VAs in a community sample, analyzed with the Tariff method, allowed assigning a cause of death to most of the cases, with results similar to those of vital statistics for most conditions. This tool can be useful to strengthen the quality of vital statistics."
https://openalex.org/W2955710062,"Interest in modeling contemporary crime trends, a task that has historically been considered valuable to the public, researchers, and policymakers, is resurging. Advancements in criminology have made it clear that understanding crime trends necessarily involves understanding trends in how likely individuals are to report crimes to the police, as well as how likely the police are to accurately record those crimes. In this paper, we use dynamic linear models to simultaneously model the time series for several crime types in order to gain insight into trends in crime and crime reporting. We analyze crime data from Chicago spanning 2007 through 2016 and show how correlations in the way crime trends evolve may contain information about drivers of crime and crime reporting. We provide evidence of substantial differences in the relationships between the trends of crimes of different types depending on whether crimes are violent or nonviolent and whether or not crimes are tracked in the FBI's Uniform Crime Report."

Considerable HIV drug resistance has occurred among persons failing tenofovir-containing first-line ART. We evaluated drug resistance at the population level using mathematical modeling. Setting Heterosexual HIV epidemic in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Methods We constructed a stochastic individual-based model and simulated scenarios of ART implementation, either CD4-based (threshold < 500 cells/mL) or Fast-track (81% coverage by 2020), with consideration of major drug-associated mutations (M184V, K65R and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)). Using base case and uncertainty analyses, we assessed (majority) drug resistance levels. Results By 2030, the median total resistance (proportion of HIV-infected persons with drug resistance) is predicted to reach 31.4% (interquartile range (IQR): 16.5%-50.2%) with CD4-based ART, decreasing to 14.5% (IQR: 7.7%-25.8%) with Fast-track implementation. In both scenarios, we find comparably high prevalence (~80%) of acquired NNRTI-associated, M184V and K65R mutations. Over 48% of individuals with acquired resistance harbor dual, 44% triple and 7% just single drug mutations. Drug-resistant HIV is predicted to comprise 40% (IQR: 27%-50%) of incident infections, while 70% of prevalent transmitted resistance is NNRTI-associated. At 2018, the projected total resistance is 15% (IQR: 7.5%-25%), with 18% (IQR: 13%-24%) of incident infections from transmitted drug-resistant HIV. Conclusions WHO-recommended preferred first-line ART could lead to substantial drug resistance. Effective surveillance of HIV drug resistance and utilization of second-line as well as alternative first-line regimens is crucial."
