https://openalex.org/W2911701742,"Synapse density is reduced in postmortem cortical tissue from schizophrenia patients, which is suggestive of increased synapse elimination. Using a reprogrammed in vitro model of microglia-mediated synapse engulfment, we demonstrate increased synapse elimination in patient-derived neural cultures and isolated synaptosomes. This excessive synaptic pruning reflects abnormalities in both microglia-like cells and synaptic structures. Further, we find that schizophrenia risk-associated variants within the human complement component 4 locus are associated with increased neuronal complement deposition and synapse uptake; however, they do not fully explain the observed increase in synapse uptake. Finally, we demonstrate that the antibiotic minocycline reduces microglia-mediated synapse uptake in vitro and its use is associated with a modest decrease in incident schizophrenia risk compared to other antibiotics in a cohort of young adults drawn from electronic health records. These findings point to excessive pruning as a potential target for delaying or preventing the onset of schizophrenia in high-risk individuals. Postmortem studies indicate reduced synaptic density in schizophrenia. Sellgren et al. show increased synaptic pruning in patient-derived cell models and provide evidence that C4 risk variants increase engulfment, while minocycline decreases it."

We present the Human Gastrointestinal Bacteria Culture Collection (HBC), a comprehensive set of 737 whole-genome-sequenced bacterial isolates, representing 273 species (105 novel species) from 31 families found in the human gastrointestinal microbiota. The HBC increases the number of bacterial genomes derived from human gastrointestinal microbiota by 37%. The resulting global Human Gastrointestinal Bacteria Genome Collection (HGG) classifies 83% of genera by abundance across 13,490 shotgun-sequenced metagenomic samples, improves taxonomic classification by 61% compared to the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) genome collection and achieves subspecies-level classification for almost 50% of sequences. The improved resource of gastrointestinal bacterial reference sequences circumvents dependence on de novo assembly of metagenomes and enables accurate and cost-effective shotgun metagenomic analyses of human gastrointestinal microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2912990896,"Reference genomes are essential for metagenomic analyses and functional characterization of the human gut microbiota. We present the Culturable Genome Reference (CGR), a collection of 1,520 nonredundant, high-quality draft genomes generated from >6,000 bacteria cultivated from fecal samples of healthy humans. Of the 1,520 genomes, which were chosen to cover all major bacterial phyla and genera in the human gut, 264 are not represented in existing reference genome catalogs. We show that this increase in the number of reference bacterial genomes improves the rate of mapping metagenomic sequencing reads from 50% to >70%, enabling higher-resolution descriptions of the human gut microbiome. We use the CGR genomes to annotate functions of 338 bacterial species, showing the utility of this resource for functional studies. We also carry out a pan-genome analysis of 38 important human gut species, which reveals the diversity and specificity of functional enrichment between their core and dispensable genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2911354827,"The RNA-guided CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins Cas9 and Cas12a provide adaptive immunity against invading nucleic acids, and function as powerful tools for genome editing in a wide range of organisms. Here we reveal the underlying mechanisms of a third, fundamentally distinct RNA-guided genome-editing platform named CRISPR–CasX, which uses unique structures for programmable double-stranded DNA binding and cleavage. Biochemical and in vivo data demonstrate that CasX is active for Escherichia coli and human genome modification. Eight cryo-electron microscopy structures of CasX in different states of assembly with its guide RNA and double-stranded DNA substrates reveal an extensive RNA scaffold and a domain required for DNA unwinding. These data demonstrate how CasX activity arose through convergent evolution to establish an enzyme family that is functionally separate from both Cas9 and Cas12a. CRISPR–CasX represents a distinct RNA-guided platform that is functionally separate from Cas9 and Cas12a and is active for bacterial and human genome modification."

We combined association genetics with R gene enrichment sequencing (AgRenSeq) to exploit pan-genome variation in wild diploid wheat and rapidly clone four stem rust resistance genes. AgRenSeq enables R gene cloning in any crop that has a diverse germplasm panel. The treasure trove of disease resistance genes present in wild relatives of domesticated crops is rapidly discovered using association genetics and enrichment sequencing.
https://openalex.org/W2951144513,"Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a poor-prognosis cancer type with rapidly rising incidence. Understanding of the genetic events driving EAC development is limited, and there are few molecular biomarkers for prognostication or therapeutics. Using a cohort of 551 genomically characterized EACs with matched RNA sequencing data, we discovered 77 EAC driver genes and 21 noncoding driver elements. We identified a mean of 4.4 driver events per tumor, which were derived more commonly from mutations than copy number alterations, and compared the prevelence of these mutations to the exome-wide mutational excess calculated using non-synonymous to synonymous mutation ratios (dN/dS). We observed mutual exclusivity or co-occurrence of events within and between several dysregulated EAC pathways, a result suggestive of strong functional relationships. Indicators of poor prognosis (SMAD4 and GATA4) were verified in independent cohorts with significant predictive value. Over 50% of EACs contained sensitizing events for CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors, which were highly correlated with clinically relevant sensitivity in a panel of EAC cell lines and organoids."
https://openalex.org/W2911597823,"Extracellular matrix (ECM) mechanical cues have powerful effects on cell proliferation, differentiation and death. Here, starting from an unbiased metabolomics approach, we identify synthesis of neutral lipids as a general response to mechanical signals delivered by cell–matrix adhesions. Extracellular physical cues reverberate on the mechanical properties of the Golgi apparatus and regulate the Lipin-1 phosphatidate phosphatase. Conditions of reduced actomyosin contractility lead to inhibition of Lipin-1, accumulation of SCAP/SREBP to the Golgi apparatus and activation of SREBP transcription factors, in turn driving lipid synthesis and accumulation. This occurs independently of YAP/TAZ, mTOR and AMPK, and in parallel to feedback control by sterols. Regulation of SREBP can be observed in a stiffened diseased tissue, and contributes to the pro-survival activity of ROCK inhibitors in pluripotent stem cells. We thus identify a general mechanism centered on Lipin-1 and SREBP that links the physical cell microenvironment to a key metabolic pathway. Romani et al. identify a response to reduced actomyosin contractility involving inhibition of Lipin-1, accumulation of SREBP transcription factors at the Golgi apparatus and activation of SREBP transcription driving increased lipid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2913847081,"Exponentially increasing amounts of unprocessed bacterial and viral genomic sequence data are stored in the global archives. The ability to query these data for sequence search terms would facilitate both basic research and applications such as real-time genomic epidemiology and surveillance. However, this is not possible with current methods. To solve this problem, we combine knowledge of microbial population genomics with computational methods devised for web search to produce a searchable data structure named BItsliced Genomic Signature Index (BIGSI). We indexed the entire global corpus of 447,833 bacterial and viral whole-genome sequence datasets using four orders of magnitude less storage than previous methods. We applied our BIGSI search function to rapidly find resistance genes MCR-1, MCR-2, and MCR-3, determine the host-range of 2,827 plasmids, and quantify antibiotic resistance in archived datasets. Our index can grow incrementally as new (unprocessed or assembled) sequence datasets are deposited and can scale to millions of datasets. The global set of bacterial and viral sequences can be rapidly searched using a data structure inspired by web-search algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W2914284695,"Considerable efforts have been recently devoted to combining ultracold atoms and nanophotonic devices to obtain not only better scalability and figures of merit than in free-space implementations, but also new paradigms for atom-photon interactions. Dielectric waveguides offer a promising platform for such integration because they enable tight transverse confinement of the propagating light, strong photon-atom coupling in single-pass configurations and potentially long-range atom-atom interactions mediated by the guided photons. However, the preparation of non-classical quantum states in such atom-waveguide interfaces has not yet been realized. Here, by using arrays of individual caesium atoms trapped along an optical nanofibre, we observe a single collective atomic excitation coupled to a nanoscale waveguide. The stored collective entangled state can be efficiently read out with an external laser pulse, leading to on-demand emission of a single photon into the guided mode. We characterize the emitted single photon via the suppression of the two-photon component and confirm the single character of the atomic excitation, which can be retrieved with an efficiency of about 25%. Our results demonstrate a capability that is essential for the emerging field of waveguide quantum electrodynamics, with applications to quantum networking, quantum nonlinear optics and quantum many-body physics."
https://openalex.org/W2914043777,"Visual working memory enables us to hold onto past sensations in anticipation that these may become relevant for guiding future actions. Yet laboratory tasks have treated visual working memories in isolation from their prospective actions and have focused on the mechanisms of memory retention rather than utilization. To understand how visual memories become used for action, we linked individual memory items to particular actions and independently tracked the neural dynamics of visual and motor selection when memories became used for action. This revealed concurrent visual-motor selection, engaging appropriate visual and motor brain areas at the same time. Thus we show that items in visual working memory can invoke multiple, item-specific, action plans that can be accessed together with the visual representations that guide them, affording fast and precise memory-guided behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2914084957,"Metagenomic sequencing has the potential to transform microbial detection and characterization, but new tools are needed to improve its sensitivity. Here we present CATCH, a computational method to enhance nucleic acid capture for enrichment of diverse microbial taxa. CATCH designs optimal probe sets, with a specified number of oligonucleotides, that achieve full coverage of, and scale well with, known sequence diversity. We focus on applying CATCH to capture viral genomes in complex metagenomic samples. We design, synthesize, and validate multiple probe sets, including one that targets the whole genomes of the 356 viral species known to infect humans. Capture with these probe sets enriches unique viral content on average 18-fold, allowing us to assemble genomes that could not be recovered without enrichment, and accurately preserves within-sample diversity. We also use these probe sets to recover genomes from the 2018 Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria and to improve detection of uncharacterized viral infections in human and mosquito samples. The results demonstrate that CATCH enables more sensitive and cost-effective metagenomic sequencing."

https://openalex.org/W2949183854,"Hereditary cancer disorders often provide an important window into novel mechanisms supporting tumor growth. Understanding these mechanisms thus represents a vital goal. Toward this goal, here we report a chemoproteomic map of fumarate, a covalent oncometabolite whose accumulation marks the genetic cancer syndrome hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC). We applied a fumarate-competitive chemoproteomic probe in concert with LC–MS/MS to discover new cysteines sensitive to fumarate hydratase (FH) mutation in HLRCC cell models. Analysis of this dataset revealed an unexpected influence of local environment and pH on fumarate reactivity, and enabled the characterization of a novel FH-regulated cysteine residue that lies at a key protein–protein interface in the SWI-SNF tumor-suppressor complex. Our studies provide a powerful resource for understanding the covalent imprint of fumarate on the proteome and lay the foundation for future efforts to exploit this distinct aspect of oncometabolism for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Chemoproteomic mapping of fumarate sensitive cysteines in a hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma cell line revealed a critical cysteine in the protein–protein interaction interface of the SWI–SNF complex."
https://openalex.org/W2913919474,"BAX is a critical effector of the mitochondrial cell death pathway in response to a diverse range of stimuli in physiological and disease contexts. Upon binding by BH3-only proteins, cytosolic BAX undergoes conformational activation and translocation, resulting in mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization. Efforts to rationally target BAX and develop inhibitors have been elusive, despite the clear therapeutic potential of inhibiting BAX-mediated cell death in a host of diseases. Here, we describe a class of small-molecule BAX inhibitors, termed BAIs, that bind directly to a previously unrecognized pocket and allosterically inhibit BAX activation. BAI binding around the hydrophobic helix α5 using hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions stabilizes key areas of the hydrophobic core. BAIs inhibit conformational events in BAX activation that prevent BAX mitochondrial translocation and oligomerization. Our data highlight a novel paradigm for effective and selective pharmacological targeting of BAX to enable rational development of inhibitors of BAX-mediated cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2912092373,"The 2016 WHO consolidated guidelines on the use of antiretroviral drugs defines HIV virologic failure for low and middle income countries (LMIC) as plasma HIV-RNA ≥ 1000 copies/mL. We evaluated virologic failure and predictors in four African countries.We included HIV-infected participants on a WHO recommended antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen and enrolled in the African Cohort Study between January 2013 and October 2017. Studied outcomes were virologic failure (plasma HIV-RNA ≥ 1000 copies/mL at the most recent visit), viraemia (plasma HIV-RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at the most recent visit); and persistent viraemia (plasma HIV-RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at two consecutive visits). Generalized linear models were used to estimate relative risks with their 95% confidence intervals.2054 participants were included in this analysis. Viraemia, persistent viraemia and virologic failure were observed in 396 (19.3%), 160 (7.8%) and 184 (9%) participants respectively. Of the participants with persistent viraemia, only 57.5% (92/160) had confirmed virologic failure. In the multivariate analysis, attending clinical care site other than the Uganda sitebeing on 2nd line ART (aRR 1.8, 95% CI 1·28-2·66); other ART combinations not first line and not second line (aRR 3.8, 95% CI 1.18-11.9), a history of fever in the past week (aRR 3.7, 95% CI 1.69-8.05), low CD4 count (aRR 6.9, 95% CI 4.7-10.2) and missing any day of ART (aRR 1·8, 95% CI 1·27-2.57) increased the risk of virologic failure. Being on 2nd line therapy, the site where one receives care and CD4 count < 500 predicted viraemia, persistent viraemia and virologic failure.In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that HIV-infected patients established on ART for more than six months in the African setting frequently experienced viraemia while continuing to be on ART. The findings also show that being on second line, low CD4 count, missing any day of ART and history of fever in the past week remain important predictors of virologic failure that should trigger intensified adherence counselling especially in the absence of reliable or readily available viral load monitoring. Finally, clinical care sites are different calling for further analyses to elucidate on the unique features of these sites."
https://openalex.org/W2914213517,"Adaptive fear responses to external threats rely upon efficient relay of computations underlying contextual encoding to subcortical circuits. Brain-wide analysis of highly coactivated ensembles following contextual fear discrimination identified the dorsolateral septum (DLS) as a relay of the dentate gyrus–CA3 circuit. Retrograde monosynaptic tracing and electrophysiological whole-cell recordings demonstrated that DLS somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SST-INs) receive direct CA3 inputs. Longitudinal in vivo calcium imaging of DLS SST-INs in awake, behaving mice identified a stable population of footshock-responsive SST-INs during contextual conditioning whose activity tracked and predicted non-freezing epochs during subsequent recall in the training context but not in a similar, neutral context or open field. Optogenetic attenuation or stimulation of DLS SST-INs bidirectionally modulated conditioned fear responses and recruited proximal and distal subcortical targets. Together, these observations suggest a role for a potentially hard-wired DLS SST-IN subpopulation as arbiters of mobility that calibrate context-appropriate behavioral fear responses. Besnard et al. uncover functional heterogeneity of somatostatin interneurons (SST-INs) in the dorsolateral septum and reveal a role for a subpopulation of SST-INs as hippocampal relays that govern mobility to calibrate adaptive fear responses."
https://openalex.org/W2914597295,"Background In people living with HIV (PLHIV) who are on anti-retroviral therapy (ART), it is essential to identify persons with high blood viral loads (VLs) (≥1000 copies/ml), provide enhanced adherence counselling (EAC) for 3 months and assess for VL suppression (<1000 copies/ml). Objective Our study objectives were to determine the proportion who had a high viral load in those people who underwent viral load testing between 1 August 2016–31 July 2017 at Wilkins Hospital, Harare, Zimbabwe. Of those with high viral load to assess; a) the proportion who enrolled for EAC, the demographic and clinical characteristics associated with enrolment for EAC and, b) the proportion who achieved viral load suppression and demographic, clinical characteristics associated with viral load suppression. Design Retrospective cohort study using routinely collected programme data. Data was collected from PLHIV who were on ART and had a high viral load from 1 August 2016 to 31 July 2017. Results Of 5,573 PLHIV on ART between 1 August 2016 and 31 July 2017, 4787 (85.9%) had undergone VL testing and 646 (13.5%) had high VLs. Of these 646, only 489 (75.7%) were enrolled for EAC, of whom 444 (69%) underwent a repeat VL test at ≥ 3 months with 201 (31.2%) achieving VL suppression. The clinical characteristics that were independently associated with higher probability of VL suppression were: a) undergoing 3 sessions of EAC; b) being on 2nd line ART. Initial VL levels >5,000 copies/ml were associated with lower probability of viral suppression. Conclusion The routine VL testing levels were high, but there were major programmatic gaps in enrolling PLHIV with high VLs into EAC and achieving VL suppression. The full potential of EAC on achieving viral load suppression has not been achieved in this setting. The reasons for these gaps need to be assessed in future research studies and addressed by suitable changes in policies/practices."

https://openalex.org/W2912882516,"Chemoresistance is a leading obstacle in effective management of advanced prostate cancer (PCa). A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in PCa chemoresistance could improve treatment of patients with PCa. In the present study, using immune histochemical, chemistry, and precipitation assays with cells from individuals with benign or malignant prostate cancer or established PCa cell lines, we found that the oncogenic transcription factor pre-B cell leukemia homeobox-1 (PBX1) promotes PCa cell proliferation and confers to resistance against common anti-cancer drugs such as doxorubicin and cisplatin. We observed that genetic PBX1 knockdown abrogates this resistance, and further experiments revealed that PBX1 stability was modulated by the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. To directly probe the impact of this pathway on PBX1 activity, we screened for PBX1-specific deubiquitinases (Dubs) and found that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9 X-linked (USP9x) interacted with and stabilized the PBX1 protein by attenuating its Lys-48–linked polyubiquitination. Moreover, the USP9x inhibitor WP1130 markedly induced PBX1 degradation and promoted PCa cell apoptosis. The results in this study indicate that PBX1 confers to PCa chemoresistance and identify USP9x as a Dub of PBX1. We concluded that targeting the USP9x/PBX1 axis could be a potential therapeutic strategy for managing advanced prostate cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2914778727,"UTX is a chromatin modifier required for development and neural lineage specification, but how it controls these biological processes is unclear. To determine the molecular mechanisms of UTX, we identified novel UTX protein interaction partners. Here we show that UTX and 53BP1 directly interact and co-occupy promoters in human embryonic stem cells and differentiating neural progenitor cells. Human 53BP1 contains a UTX-binding site that diverges from its mouse homolog by 41%, and disruption of the 53BP1-UTX interaction abrogated human, but not mouse, neurogenesis in vitro. The 53BP1-UTX interaction is required to upregulate key neurodevelopmental genes during the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into neurons or into cortical organoids. 53BP1 promotes UTX chromatin binding, and in turn H3K27 modifications and gene activation, at a subset of genomic regions, including neurogenic genes. Overall, our data suggest that the 53BP1-UTX interaction supports the activation of key genes required for human neurodevelopment."
https://openalex.org/W2915040676,"GCN5-related N-acetyl-transferase (GNAT)-like enzymes from toxin–antitoxin modules are strong inhibitors of protein synthesis. Here, we present the bases of the regulatory mechanisms of ataRT, a model GNAT-toxin–antitoxin module, from toxin synthesis to its action as a transcriptional de-repressor. We show the antitoxin (AtaR) traps the toxin (AtaT) in a pre-catalytic monomeric state and precludes the effective binding of ac-CoA and its target Met-transfer RNAfMet. In the repressor complex, AtaR intrinsically disordered region interacts with AtaT at two different sites, folding into different structures, that are involved in two separate functional roles, toxin neutralization and placing the DNA-binding domains of AtaR in a binding-compatible orientation. Our data suggests AtaR neutralizes AtaT as a monomer, right after its synthesis and only the toxin–antitoxin complex formed in this way is an active repressor. Once activated by dimerization, later neutralization of the toxin results in a toxin–antitoxin complex that is not able to repress transcription. Structural and biochemical analysis of the AtaR–AtaT toxin–antioxin system reveals that AtaR traps AtaT in a precatalytic monomeric state and forms a heterohexameric complex to neutralize AtaT and repress transcription of the operon."
https://openalex.org/W2913431689,"TB remains a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in sub-Saharan Africa, due to the HIV epidemic. As TB treatment is lengthy, the completion of the full course of treatment may be especially challenging for young people. We therefore aimed to identify the extent of and reasons underlying loss to follow-up from TB treatment among young people in Cape Town. Accordingly, we reviewed the outcomes of young people treated for TB in Cape Town during 2009–2013, across three age groups: younger adolescents (10–14 years); older adolescents; (15–19 years) and young adults (20–24 years). We employed logistic regression analysis to identify risk factors for loss from TB care. 23,737 patients aged 10–24 were treated for drug sensitive TB over the study period. Of these, the HIV co-infection prevalence was 18.5% for younger adolescents, 12.9% for older adolescents and 33.1% for young adults. From age 16, HIV prevalence increased disproportionately among young women: by age 22, over 50% of women were TB/HIV co-infected compared to 14% of men. TB treatment success (cure plus completion) was 84.4%, while 1.7% of patients died, 9.5% were lost-to follow-up and 0.4% failed treatment. Being an older adolescent (aOR 1.75 [95% CI: 1.38–2.21]) or young adult (aOR: 1.96 [95% CI: 1.57–2.45]) increased the risk of loss-to-follow up, relative to being a younger adolescent. Further risk factors for loss from TB care were male gender (aOR: 1.33 [95% CI:1.20–1.46]), being a TB/HIV co-infected young person (aOR 1.74 [95% CI: 1.57–1.93]) and having had prior treatment for TB (aOR 3.17 [95% CI 2.87–3.51]). We identified risk factors for loss to follow-up and highlighted the need to focus on HIV prevention and retention in TB care among young people. TB care tailored to the needs of young people could improve patient retention, similar to improved outcomes reported by youth friendly HIV clinics."

YY1 has been reported to play dual biological functions as either an oncogene or tumor suppressor in the development and progression of multiple cancers, but its role in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has not yet been revealed. In this study, we found that YY1 overexpression significantly inhibits cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression from G1 to S and promotes apoptosis in NPC cells. Moreover, we identified YY1 as a component of the c-Myc complex and observed that ectopic expression of YY1 inhibits c-Myc transcriptional activity, as well as the promoter activity and expression of the c-Myc target gene microRNA-141 (miR-141). Furthermore, restoring miR-141 expression could at least partially reverse the inhibitory effect of YY1 on cell proliferation and tumor growth and on the expression of some critical c-Myc targets, such as PTEN/AKT pathway components both in vitro and in vivo. We also found that YY1 expression is reduced in NPC tissues, negatively correlates with miR-141 expression and clinical stages in NPC patients, and positively correlates with survival prognosis.

In c-Myc–dependent cancer models, c-Myc inactivation cannot only regress tumor growth but also induce cell death, suggesting that c-Myc inactivation can impact a range of human cancers (8Adhikary S. Eilers M. Transcriptional regulation and transformation by Myc proteins.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6 (16064138): 635-64510.1038/nrm1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). As a critical transcription factor, c-Myc is widely involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, metabolism, somatic cell reprogramming, and other key processes under normal or pathological conditions via the regulation of numerous target genes (9Rahl P.B. Young R.A. MYC and transcription elongation.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2014; 4 (24384817): a02099010.1101/cshperspect.a020990Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, strategies for down-regulating the c-Myc transcriptional activity are thus widely sought. We previously found that miR-141 functions as an oncogenic miRNA in NPC and plays critical roles in NPC development and progression (10Zhang L. Deng T. Li X. Liu H. Zhou H. Ma J. Wu M. Zhou M.

Moreover, c-Myc is known to specifically bind the miR-141 promoter region and thus regulate the transcriptional activation of miR-141, whereas c-Myc knockdown has been shown to activate PTEN/AKT signaling and suppress cell proliferation and tumor growth via transcriptional down-regulation of miR-141 in NPC cells (11Liu Y.

Khan M.A. Goss D.J. Kinetic analysis of the interaction of b/HLH/Z transcription factors Myc, Max, and Mad with cognate DNA.Biochemistry. 2010; 49 (20170194): 2627-263510.1021/bi901913aCrossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Lüscher B.

Alternatively, transcriptional repression by Mad is mediated through its interaction with mSin3, which results in the recruitment of histone deacetylases and corepressor molecules and thus leads to the transcriptional repression of target genes (16Nair S.K.

Further exploration of the molecular mechanism of c-Myc in NPC using bioinformatics analyses revealed Yin Yang-1 (YY1) as a potential c-Myc–interacting protein that might be involved in the regulation of c-Myc target genes (17Shrivastava A. Yu J. Artandi S. Calame K. YY1 and c-Myc associate in vivo in a manner that depends on c-Myc levels.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

YY1 is a ubiquitously expressed member of the GLI–Kruppel family of zinc-finger transcription factors that is abnormally expressed in most human tumors and exerts dual biological functions as a tumor suppressor or oncogene through the regulation of different target genes or signaling pathways (19Zhang Q. Stovall D.B. Inoue K. Sui G. The oncogenic role of Yin Yang 1.Crit. Rev. Oncog. 2011; 16 (22248053): 163-19710.1615/CritRevOncog.v16.i3-4.30Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 20Gordon S.

These dual functions in different cancers are probably because YY1 can both positively and negatively regulate gene expression, as well as interact with a multitude of proteins with diverse functions (21Khachigian L.M. The Yin and Yang of YY1 in tumor growth and suppression.Int. J. Cancer. 2018; 143 (29322514): 460-46510.1002/ijc.31255Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of YY1 with different binding partners reveal that YY1 is a key scaffold protein that functionally interfaces with various partners to regulate gene transcription and participate in multiple signaling pathways. However, the precise biological function of YY1 in NPC remains unclear. In this study, we revealed that YY1 significantly inhibits cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression and induces apoptosis in NPC cells. Moreover, YY1 was identified as a component of the c-Myc complex, and ectopic expression of YY1 is able to inhibit c-Myc transcriptional activity, as well as the promoter activity and expression of the critical downstream target gene miR-141. Furthermore, restoring the expression of miR-141 at least partially reverses the inhibitory effects of YY1 on cell proliferation, cell-cycle progression, apoptosis and tumor growth, as well as the expression of some critical c-Myc targets, such as the PTEN/AKT pathway, both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, YY1 is also down-regulated in NPC tissues, and the YY1 protein level is negatively correlated with the clinical stage in NPC patients and miR-141 expression, while positively correlated with survival prognosis. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the YY1/c-Myc/miR-141 axis plays a critical role in the development and progression of NPC, thereby providing potential targets for the diagnosis and treatment of NPC. As an important transcription factor, YY1 plays dual biological roles as an oncogene or tumor suppressor in different tumors. However, its role in nasopharyngeal carcinoma has not been defined. To confirm the role of YY1 in NPC progression, 5-8F and HNE2 cell lines stably overexpressing YY1 were constructed, and the expression of exogenous YY1 was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). Then, we investigated the effect of YY1 on cell proliferation. CCK-8 assays show that YY1 overexpression inhibits cell proliferation in both 5-8F and HNE2 cell lines (Fig. 1B), which was further confirmed by colony-forming assays. YY1-overexpressing 5-8F and HNE2 cells formed ∼40 and 50% fewer colonies, respectively, compared with their negative controls (Fig. 1C). To define the underlying biological mechanisms, we further analyzed the effect of YY1 overexpression on cell-cycle progression (Fig. 1D) and found that ectopic expression of YY1 significantly increases the G0/G1 population, followed by a decrease in the S-phase, in both 5-8F and HNE2 cells compared with control cells. Furthermore, we examined the effect of YY1 on cell apoptosis by conducting annexin V-PE/7-AAD double-staining and flow-cytometry analysis after the cells were serum-starved for 24 h, and the results show that both 5-8F and HNE2 cells overexpressing YY1 have significantly higher percentages of apoptotic cells compared with negative control (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, we investigated the effect of YY1 knockdown on cell biological functions by RNAi technology with si-YY1 (Fig. S1 and Fig. 2A), and the results show that knockdown of YY1 increases cell proliferation, colony formation, and cell-cycle G1/S transition (Fig. 2, B–D) and inhibits cell apoptosis (Fig. 2E). Taken together, these data suggest that YY1 inhibits cell proliferation and the G1–S transition and promotes apoptosis in both 5-8F and HNE2 cells and thus functions as a potential tumor suppressor in NPC cells.Figure 2Depletion of YY1 by siRNA promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis in NPC cell lines.

Further bioinformatics analysis revealed YY1 as a potential c-Myc–interacting protein. To confirm the interaction between c-Myc and YY1, we analyzed the subcellular localization of YY1 and c-Myc in 5-8F and HNE2 cells by immunofluorescence, and the results show that YY1 is colocalized with c-Myc in the nucleus (Fig. 3A). YY1 was also found to interact with c-Myc, as performed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments with the lysates from HEK293 cells co-transfected with c-Myc and YY1 (Fig. 3, B and C). Because both YY1 and c-Myc are critical transcription factors, we then explored the effect of YY1 on the expression of c-Myc as well as the effect of c-Myc on the expression of YY1. Western blotting and qRT-PCR indicated that overexpression or knockdown of YY1 has no effect on c-Myc protein or mRNA levels (Fig. S2, A, B, and E). Meanwhile, knockdown of c-Myc similarly fails to alter YY1 protein or mRNA levels (Fig. S2, C and D). Therefore, these results suggest that YY1 is a component of the c-Myc transcriptional complex and a negative regulator of c-Myc transcriptional activity. c-Myc is a helix-loop-helix leucine zipper protein that dimerizes with an obligate partner, Max, to bind DNA sites, 5′-CACGTG-3′, termed E-boxes. Therefore, we first confirmed the promoter activity of a c-Myc target consensus sequence containing three E-boxes in NPC cells (Fig. 3D), and we then investigated the effect of YY1 on c-Myc transcriptional activity using double-luciferase reporter assays. The results show that c-Myc activity was significantly down-regulated in YY1-overexpressing cells compared with control cells (Fig. 3E), suggesting that YY1 might directly play a negative role in c-Myc–mediated transcription. Furthermore, co-IP experiments were performed on total protein extracts to confirm that overexpression of YY1 reduces the formation of Max and c-Myc heterodimers ∼71% compared with the negative control. Conversely, the Mad and c-Myc protein complex increases ∼37% (Fig. 3F). These results indicate that YY1 inhibits c-Myc transcriptional activity toward the target gene by decreasing the binding of the c-Myc/Max/Mad complex to E-box sequences. Because YY1 is a component of the c-Myc transcriptional complex and negatively regulates c-Myc transcriptional activity, miR-141 was previously identified as a critical oncogenic miRNA that is directly transcriptionally regulated by c-Myc. We further verified the functions of miR-141 in HNE2 cells used in this study and found that miR-141 promotes cell proliferation and colony formation (Fig. S3, A and B). Thus, we hypothesized that YY1 is a negative regulator of the c-Myc/miR-141 transcriptional axis and thus plays a critical role in the progression of NPC. Therefore, we first used dual-luciferase report assays and real-time PCR to detect the effect of YY1 on c-Myc–dependent miR-141 transcription and expression. As a result, ectopic expression of c-Myc led to the up-regulation of miR-141 promoter activity and expression, which is consistent with previous results (12Liu Y. Zhao R. Wei Y. Li M. Wang H. Niu W. Zhou Y. Qiu Y. Fan S. Zhan Y. Xiong W. Zhou Y. Li X. Li Z. Li G. et al.BRD7 expression and c-Myc activation forms a double-negative feedback loop that controls the cell proliferation and tumor growth of nasopharyngeal carcinoma by targeting oncogenic miR-141.J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res. 2018; 37 (29559001): 6410.1186/s13046-018-0734-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), whereas YY1 overexpression decreases the effect of c-Myc on miR-141 promoter activity and expression in 5-8F and HNE2 cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Next, we investigated the effect of YY1 on the expression of pri-, pre-, and mature miR-141, as well as the promoter activity of miR-141 driven by endogenous c-Myc in NPC cells. The qRT-PCR results show that overexpressing YY1 down-regulates the expression of pri-, pre-, and mature miR-141, as well as miR-141 promoter activity (Fig. 4, C and D), but they present no effect on the expression levels of Drosha and Dicer, which are involved in miRNA processing (Fig. 4E). Inversely, knockdown of YY1 increases the expression of miR-141 (Fig. S2F). To verify whether the regulation of YY1 on miR-141 depends on c-Myc, we examined the effect of YY1 overexpression on the promoter activity and expression of miR-141 in both 5-8F and HNE2 cells with c-Myc knockdown, and the results show that c-Myc knockdown causes the deregulation of YY1 on the promoter activity and expression of miR-141 (Fig. 4, F–H). These findings demonstrate that YY1 transcriptionally down-regulates miR-141 expression by negatively regulating c-Myc transcriptional activity. Given that YY1 functions as a tumor suppressor in NPC by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis and that YY1 down-regulates oncogenic miR-141 expression, we wondered whether the effect of YY1 on cell proliferation and apoptosis is mediated by its negative regulation of miR-141. Therefore, rescue assays were performed by cotransfecting 5-8F/YY1 and HNE2/YY1 cells with the miR-141 mimic. The expression of exogenous miR-141 was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. S4). To determine the impact of miR-141 restoration on cell proliferation and colony formation by NPC cells, we performed CCK-8 and colony-forming assays. As expected, ectopic expression of YY1 obviously inhibits cell proliferation and colony formation in 5-8F and HNE2 cells (YY1), whereas restoring the expression of miR-141 in YY1-overexpressing cells (YY1 + miR-141) markedly rescues cell proliferation and colony formation compared with YY1-overexpressing cells (YY1) (Fig. 5, B and C). Furthermore, we analyzed the effect of miR-141 rescue on cell-cycle progression. The results show that overexpression of YY1 arrests cell cycle cells in the G0/G1 phase, but restoring the expression of miR-141 causes a significant decrease in the G0/G1 population, followed by an increase in S-phase cells compared with YY1 overexpression alone (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, overexpression of YY1 significantly increases the percentage of apoptotic cells in the NPC cells when compared with the negative controls, while restoring miR-141 expression dramatically rescues the effect of YY1 on apoptosis induction in NPC cells (Fig. 6B). Consistent with the results from flow-cytometry assays, Western blotting results show that overexpression of YY1 results in a significant increase of c-PARP, a critical apoptosis marker (11Liu Y. Zhao R. Wang H. Luo Y. Wang X. Niu W. Zhou Y. Wen Q. Fan S. Li X. Xiong W. Ma J. Li X. Tan M. Li G. et al.miR-141 is involved in BRD7-mediated cell proliferation and tumor formation through suppression of the PTEN/AKT pathway in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.Cell Death Dis. 2016; 7 (27010857): e215610.1038/cddis.2016.64Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), while restoring the expression of miR-141 dramatically recovers the expression of c-PARP (Fig. 5A). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that rescuing miR-141 expression at least partially reverses the tumor-suppressive effect of YY1 on cell proliferation and apoptosis in vitro, suggesting that YY1 plays critical roles in cell-cycle arrest and initiation of apoptosis by negatively regulating miR-141 transcription during NPC progression.Figure 6Restoring miR-141 levels reverses the effect of YY1 on cell cycle and apoptosis in NPC cells.

All experiments were performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because our in vitro results show that YY1 regulates miR-141 to affect NPC cell proliferation and apoptosis, we next investigated whether YY1 inhibits tumor growth through down-regulation of miR-141 in vivo. Therefore, we performed in vivo experiments using xenograft tumor models in nude mice. 5-8F/control, 5-8F/YY1, and 5-8F/YY1 with transfection of the miR-141 mimic were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 5-week-old female nude mice, respectively. All xenograft model mice were killed on day 38 in order to examine the final tumor volume, and the results show that tumor size in nude mice injected with 5-8F/YY1 cells is obviously reduced compared with the negative control, whereas the size could be dramatically recovered when miR-141 expression was restored in 5-8F/YY1 cells (Fig. 7A). Meanwhile, xenograft tumor weight and growth rate with miR-141 restoration significantly increase compared with the 5–8 F/YY1 group (Fig. 7, B and C). In addition, the expression of YY1 and miR-141 in xenograft tumor tissues was confirmed by Western blotting and qRT-PCR (Fig. 7, D and E). To further confirm the effect of miR-141 restoration on tumor growth and apoptosis in vivo, we analyzed the percentage of cells expressing the proliferation marker Ki67, and the results show that ectopic expression of YY1 significantly reduces the number of Ki67-positive cells, whereas miR-141 restoration significantly recovers the number of Ki67-positive cells, which was also confirmed by H&E staining (Fig. 7F). These results indicate that YY1 inhibits tumor growth and presents anti-tumor effects in vivo, while restoring the expression of miR-141 significantly reverses these effects. We previously reported that PTEN functions as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating the AKT-signaling pathway. PTEN was identified to be a direct target of miR-141 and was post-transcriptionally down-regulated by miR-141 in NPC cells. Moreover, increasing evidence indicated that the aberrant PTEN/AKT pathway activation is essential for the development and progression of NPC. Therefore, we performed Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect the expression of some critical components of the PTEN/AKT pathway in 5-8F cells and the corresponding xenograft tumor tissues. As a result, PTEN protein increases and p-AKT decreases in YY1-overexpressed NPC cells and their xenograft tumor tissues compared with the negative controls, while restoring miR-141 expression causes a significant reversion. In addition, we detected the expression of some molecules related to cell cycle and apoptosis, and the results reveal that CCND1 is largely decreased, while p21 and c-PARP are obviously increased. Moreover, restoring miR-141 expression in YY1-overexpressing cells results in a significant reversion, although CDK4 levels remain unaltered (Fig. 8, A and B). Consequently, these data show that YY1 inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis by down-regulating the miR-141/PTEN/AKT pathway in vitro and in vivo. To confirm the role of YY1 and miR-141 in NPC, we detected their expression in NPC tissues derived from 29 healthy donors and 126 patients varying in age, gender, histological type, and the clinical stage using IHC staining and in situ hybridization (ISH). As a result, most patients exhibit significant reduction of the YY1 protein, and YY1 expression is decreasing with the increasing clinical TNM stage in NPC patients (Table 1 and Fig. 9, A and B). We also analyzed the association between YY1 expression and the survival of NPC patients with follow-up data selected from the total of NPC samples. The survival time ranged from 3 to 120 months, and the OS rate of patients with high YY1 expression is significantly higher compared with low YY1 expression (Fig. 9C). These results indicate that YY1 plays an essential role in NPC development. However, the average miR-141 levels in NPC tissues were higher than those in nontumor NPC control tissues (Fig. S5, A and B), and the OS rate of patients with low miR-141 expression is significantly higher than that in patients with high miR-141 expression (Fig. S5C), and the expression level of miR-141 is negatively correlated with the protein level of YY1 in NPC patients (r = −0.207, p < 0.001, Table 2) (Fig. 9D). We then assessed the relationship between the expression levels of YY1 and miR-141 and prognosis. The results show that low YY1 and high miR-141 expressions in NPC patients are both associated with poorer survival rates. Conversely, high YY1 and low miR-141 expression correlated with favorable survival in NPC patients (Fig. 9E). These findings indicate that both YY1 and miR-141 might be involved in NPC progression and that YY1 might be a negative regulator of miR-141 in NPC. In conclusion, YY1 is a component of the c-Myc transcriptional complex and negatively regulates c-Myc transcriptional activity by disrupting the c-Myc/Max complex; therefore, YY1 inhibits cell proliferation and tumor growth and initiates apoptosis through inactivation of the c-Myc/miR-141/PTEN/AKT axis in NPC (Fig. 9F).Table 1Association between the expression of YY1, miR-141 and NPC clin"

However, the critical downstream effectors that can be therapeutically targeted remain to be identified. In this study, we have found that the expression of the α1 and β1 subunits of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) was directly and specifically regulated by ERG in vitro and in vivo and was significantly associated with TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in clinical PCa cohorts. sGC is the major mediator of nitric oxide (NO)-cGMP signaling in cells that, upon NO binding, catalyzes the synthesis of cGMP and subsequently activates protein kinase G (PKG). We showed that cGMP synthesis was significantly elevated by ERG in PCa cells, leading to increased PKG activity and cell proliferation. Importantly, we also demonstrated that sGC inhibitor treatment repressed tumor growth in TMPRSS2-ERG-positive PCa xenograft models and can act in synergy with a potent AR antagonist, enzalutamide. This study strongly suggests that targeting NO-cGMP signaling pathways may be a novel therapeutic strategy to treat PCa with TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion."

However, in vivo biochemical analyses of these processes are challenging, which has prevented defining and quantifying the homeostatic interplay between Cu+-sensing transcriptional regulators, chaperones, and sequestering molecules. The cytoplasm of Pseudomonas aeruginosa contains a Cu+-sensing transcriptional regulator, CueR, and two homologous metal chaperones, CopZ1 and CopZ2, forming a unique system for studying Cu+ homeostasis. We found here that both chaperones exchange Cu+, albeit at a slow rate, reaching equilibrium after 3 h, a time much longer than P. aeruginosa duplication time. Therefore, they appeared as two separate cellular Cu+ pools. Although both chaperones transferred Cu+ to CueR in vitro, experiments in vivo indicated that CopZ1 metallates CueR, eliciting the translation of Cu+ efflux transporters involved in metal tolerance. Although this observation was consistent with the relative Cu+ affinities of the three proteins (CopZ1 < CueR < CopZ2), in vitro and in silico analyses also indicated a stronger interaction between CopZ1 and CueR that was independent of Cu+. In contrast, CopZ2 function was defined by its distinctly high abundance during Cu2+ stress. Under resting conditions, CopZ2 remained largely in its apo form. Metal stress quickly induced CopZ2 expression, and its holo form predominated, reaching levels commensurate with the cytoplasmic Cu+ levels. In summary, these results show that CopZ1 acts as chaperone delivering Cu+ to the CueR sensor, whereas CopZ2 functions as a fast-response Cu+-sequestering storage protein. We propose that equivalent proteins likely play similar roles in most bacterial systems. Copper homeostasis in pathogenic bacteria is critical for cuproprotein assembly and virulence.

Copper antibacterial properties and the role in innate immunity are the direct consequence of this cellular toxicity (7Ladomersky E. Petris M.J.

In vitro biochemical studies have shown high affinity Cu+ bind to these proteins leading to the virtual absence of unbound metal with Cu+ movement via ligand exchange among interacting proteins (1Argüello J.M.

These observations have not, however, produced an integrated description of the molecular interplay leading to cellular Cu+/2+ homeostasis. This is, there is a conceptual gap between the phenotypical observations (effect of Cu+/2+ on cell growth rate) and the biochemical characterization of isolated molecules. Consider for instance, the limited information on how Cu+ reaches compartmentally restricted target cupro-proteins or that no plasma membrane transporters enabling Cu+/2+ influx have been characterized, except for CcoA that provides copper for cytochrome c oxidase assembly (13Ekici S. Yang H. Koch H.G. Daldal F.

Further complicating the analysis, Cu+ distribution/sensing molecules are not ubiquitous, as different bacterial species have solved Cu+/2+ tolerance using alternative strategies (1Argüello J.M.

Assuming that copper homeostasis is enabled by an integrated molecular system distributing Cu+ to various targets, we characterized this molecular network in Pseudomonas aeruginosa under nondeleterious extracellular Cu2+ stress. This is, the system was studied under steady state conditions where Cu+ influx is equal to efflux, cells have the capacity to sequester cytoplasmic Cu+ excess, and there is no change on cellular growth rate (15Quintana J. Novoa-Aponte L. Argüello J.M. Copper homeostasis networks in the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol.

Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis revealed the presence of cytoplasmic (CueR) and periplasmic (CopS/R) Cu+ sensing regulators, their corresponding regulons, multiple metal chaperones, and specific Cu+ efflux and influx systems bridging the membranes separating cellular compartments (15Quintana J. Novoa-Aponte L. Argüello J.M. Copper homeostasis networks in the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol.

This was later complemented by mathematical simulation of fluxes and compartmental pools describing the experimental metal uptake kinetics (16Parmar J.H. Quintana J. Ramírez D. Laubenbacher R. Argüello J.M. Mendes P. An important role for periplasmic storage in Pseudomonas aeruginosa copper homeostasis revealed by a combined experimental and computational modeling study.Mol. Microbiol. 2018; 110 (30047562): 357-36910.1111/mmi.14086Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These computational models support novel homeostatic elements revealed by the architecture of the CueR and CopS/R regulons; for instance, the participation of the CusCBA system mobilizing cytoplasmic Cu+, or the significant role that periplasmic proteins might play in the response to external Cu2+. However, whereas these approaches gave an initial picture of the homeostatic network, they provided little information on the intra-compartmental metal distribution. How is Cu+ exchanged among soluble proteins in each compartment? Which molecules chaperone Cu+ and interact with the alternative transporters? How is the measured excess Cu+ stored under steady state conditions? Considering the fate of Cu+ in P. aeruginosa cytoplasm, the interplay of CueR and the two identified cytoplasmic metal chaperones appears key for the metal distribution. CueR is a member of the MerR family (17Brown N.L. Stoyanov J.V. Kidd S.P. Hobman J.L. The MerR family of transcriptional regulators.FEMS Microbiol.

It forms homodimers with three domains: a N-terminal DNA-binding domain, a central dimerization helix, and a C-terminal region where two cysteines are responsible for metal binding (12Changela A.

The high binding affinity of the sensor has led to assume that there is no “free” cytoplasmic Cu+ (12Changela A. Chen K. Xue Y. Holschen J. Outten C.E. O’Halloran T.V. Mondragón A.

Quite relevant, it is unknown how CueR acquires the metal. Although CopZ-like Cu+ chaperones appear to deliver the metal to other transcriptional regulators such as CopY (22Odermatt A. Solioz M.

Interestingly, P. aeruginosa genome encodes for two cytoplasmic Cu+ chaperones, CopZ1 and CopZ2 (15Quintana J. Novoa-Aponte L. Argüello J.M. Copper homeostasis networks in the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol.

Both are under control of CueR, binding Cu+ with 1:1 stoichiometry and high affinity, CopZ1 4 × 10−15 m and CopZ2 8 × 10−17 m (15Quintana J. Novoa-Aponte L. Argüello J.M. Copper homeostasis networks in the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol.

This multiplicity of copper chaperones has been also observed in Streptomyces lividans that has four CopZ-like Cu+ chaperones (25Chaplin A.K. Tan B.G. Vijgenboom E. Worrall J.A. Copper trafficking in the CsoR regulon of Streptomyces lividans.Metallomics. 2015; 7 (25409712): 145-15510.1039/C4MT00250DCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even though their Cu+ affinities have been determined (CopZ-1317 10−17 m and CopZ-3079 10−18 m), their possible function is obscure as they both appear to interact similarly with CsoR. A bioinformatic approach has also shown the presence of various CopZ homologous proteins in some Rhizobiales species and a correlation with multiple Cu+-ATPases encoded in the genomes was observed (26Cubillas C. Miranda-Sanchez F. Gonzalez-Sanchez A. Elizalde J.P. Vinuesa P. Brom S. Garcia-de Los Santos A. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of copper transporting P1B ATPases from bacteria of the Rhizobiales order uncovers multiplicity, diversity and novel taxonomic subtypes.Microbiologyopen. 2017; Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the distinct roles of P. aeruginosa Cu-chaperones, CopZ1 and CopZ2. In vitro and in vivo studies show that CopZ1 delivers metal to CueR via protein-protein interactions; whereas the more abundant CopZ2 serves as the Cu+ storage pool providing a fast-homeostatic response to high Cu+ level conditions. These properties provide a mechanistical model to explain the various equilibria among cytoplasmic Cu+-binding proteins and a novel strategy for Cu+ tolerance via metal binding to a cytoplasmic protein. The structural similarities between CopZ1 and CopZ2, sharing 37% sequence identity and the invariant CXXC Cu-binding motif, might suggest an analogous functional role. Analysis of 896 homologous sequences shows that these can be divided in two subgroups of chaperones. The CopZ1-like subgroup (544 sequences), including all eukaryotic chaperones, shows a conserved CXGC sequence in the metal-binding region (Fig. 1A). Instead, CopZ2-like proteins (352 sequences) are only present in prokaryotes and the Cu+-binding loop has an invariant His (MXCXHC) (Fig. 1B). This His is likely responsible for the higher Cu+ affinity observed in P. aeruginosa CopZ2 (15Quintana J. Novoa-Aponte L. Argüello J.M. Copper homeostasis networks in the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 (28760827): 15691-1570410.1074/jbc.M117.804492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), as it has been shown that its removal decreases S. lividans CopZs affinity for Cu+ (25Chaplin A.K. Tan B.G. Vijgenboom E. Worrall J.A. Copper trafficking in the CsoR regulon of Streptomyces lividans.Metallomics. 2015; 7 (25409712): 145-15510.1039/C4MT00250DCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the His is probably determinant of their different behavior in the presence of Cu+ where CopZ2 (but not CopZ1) forms Cu+-mediated multimeric structures even with equimolar Cu+ as observed in native PAGE gels (Fig. 1C). It is known that in various conditions, chaperones form protein clusters binding multiple Cu+ ions (27Kihlken M.A. Leech A.P. Le Brun N.E.

However, it is not our goal here to analyze these structures, but rather point out the different structural and Cu+-binding properties that might lead to the alternative roles shown below. Searching for biological evidences of their distinct functions, we examined the contributions of P. aeruginosa CopZ1 and CopZ2 to the overall cellular tolerance to Cu+ stress. Strains carrying deletion mutants in the coding genes (ΔcopZ1, ΔcopZ2, and ΔcopZ1/ΔcopZ2) were grown in LB medium containing various Cu2+ concentrations (Fig. 2A). The P. aeruginosa ΔcopA1 mutant strain lacking the Cu+-ATPase responsible for cytoplasmic Cu+ efflux was included as a control (32González-Guerrero M. Raimunda D. Cheng X. Argüello J.M. Distinct functional roles of homologous Cu+ efflux ATPases in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Mol. Mirobiol. 2010; 78: 1246-125810.1111/j.1365-2958.2010.07402.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the absence of added metal, the growth rate of all strains was similar to that of the wildtype (WT) cells. No significant differences were detected in the growth rate of ΔcopZ1 and ΔcopZ2 in the presence of low 0–3 mm Cu2+. However, the ΔcopZ1 mutant was more susceptible to metal toxicity at higher, 3.5 mm Cu2+ levels. A slightly more pronounced phenotype was observed in the double mutant ΔcopZ1/ΔcopZ2, whereas the susceptibility to Cu2+ was abrogated in the ΔcopZ1::copZ1-complemented strain. This altered tolerance to Cu2+ in ΔcopZ1 was similar to that observed for deletion mutants of homologous genes in Bacillus subtilis, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and Enterococcus hirae (22Odermatt A.

The distinct growth phenotypes of ΔcopZ1 and ΔcopZ2 under Cu2+ stress were supported by determinations of whole cell Cu levels (Fig. 2B). Treatment of cells for 10 min with 0.5 mm CuSO4 was chosen to examine effects on the overall Cu homeostasis. We have shown that these conditions raise cellular Cu but do not affect cellular growth rates (15Quintana J. Novoa-Aponte L. Argüello J.M. Copper homeostasis networks in the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol.

More relevant, both ΔcopZ1 and ΔcopZ1/ΔcopZ2 mutant strains showed significantly higher levels of cellular Cu upon exposure to CuSO4. On the other hand, the ΔcopZ2 mutation did not affect the cell copper levels paralleling its lack of growth phenotype. These differences in Cu2+ tolerance and cellular metal levels observed in ΔcopZ1 and ΔcopZ2 strains point out distinct functional roles for the corresponding proteins. Cu+ transfer between homologous CopZ proteins and the structurally similar N-terminal metal-binding domains present in Cu+-ATPases is well characterized (38Lutsenko S.

This hinted at a possible Cu+ exchange among CopZ1 and CopZ2; although, the large difference in their Cu+ affinities might limit metal transfer from CopZ2 to CopZ1 (CopZ2 KD = 8 × 10−17 m; CopZ1 KD = 4 × 10−15 m (15Quintana J. Novoa-Aponte L. Argüello J.M. Copper homeostasis networks in the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol.

To explore the CopZs/Cu+ exchange, we performed bidirectional in vitro Cu+ transfer assays. This is a CopZ was loaded with equimolar amounts of Cu+, incubated in the presence of its apo homolog, separated with affinity Ni-NTA 2The abbreviations used are: Ni-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidr.m.s.root mean squareBCSbathocuproinedisulfonic acid disodium saltTEVtobacco etch virusPDBProtein Data Bank. resin, and Cu+ associated with each CopZ measured. All assays were performed in the presence of reducing 10 mm ascorbic acid. Fig. 3A shows that CopZ1holo transferred bound Cu+, although not all, to CopZ2apo. Alternatively, as expected, a much limited transfer was apparent from CopZ2holo to CopZ1apo (Fig. 3B). In both cases, control experiments performed in the absence of acceptor protein show that <5% of Cu+ was dissociated from the holo donor after a 10-min reaction (Fig. 3, A and B). The Cu+-exchange was not due to dissociation from donor and subsequent binding to acceptor. Although these experiments show a predominant transfer of Cu+ from CopZ1 to CopZ2, it was apparent that equilibrium was not reached under the experimental conditions. The ratio of the CopZ1/CopZ2 Cu+ binding KD yields a Keq = 42; yet, if the levels of the CopZ1apo/holo and CopZ2apo/holo at the end of the 10-min exchange were considered, a reaction quotient smaller than that expected from the Keq was observed (Fig. 3C). Alternatively, longer Cu+ exchange experiments showed that after a 3-h incubation, the reaction quotient for the exchange reaction reached a value of 53, quite close to the calculated Keq. These data clearly show the anticipated Cu+ exchange and that the predicted equilibrium is eventually reached. This indicates that at equilibrium the CopZ2holo predominates over CopZ1holo. Perhaps more important, the data reveals a quite slow Cu+ exchange. Considering the P. aeruginosa duplication time of 25–35 min in LB media (41LaBauve A.E. Wargo M.J.

Adsorption of R pyocins to target strains occurs by the interaction of tail fiber proteins with core lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Here, we demonstrate that N-terminally truncated R pyocin tail fibers corresponding to a region of variation between R-subtypes are sufficient to bind target strains according to R-subtype. We also report the crystal structures of these tail fiber proteins and show that they form an elongated helical trimer composed of three domains arranged linearly from N- to C-terminus: a baseplate proximal head, medial shaft, and distal foot. The head and shaft domains contain novel structural motifs. The foot domain, however, is composed of a conserved jellyroll fold and shares high structural similarity to the tail fiber of myophage AP22, podophage tailspike C-terminal domains (LKA-1 and ɸ297), and several eukaryotic adhesins (discoidin I/II, agglutinin, and octocoral lectin). Many of these proteins bind polysaccharides by means of their distal loop network, a series of highly variable loops at one end of the conserved jellyroll fold backbone. Our structures reveal that the majority of R-subtype specific polymorphisms cluster in patches covering a cleft formed at the oligomeric interface of the head domain and in a large patch covering much of the foot domain, including the distal loop network. Based on the structural variation in distal loops within the foot region, we propose that the foot is the primary sugar-binding domain of R pyocins and R-subtype specific structural differences in the foot domain distal loop network are responsible for binding target strains in an R-subtype dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2914487443,"The deubiquitylation of target proteins is mediated by deubiquitylating enzymes (DUB) such as OTUB1, which plays an important role in immune response, cell cycle progression, and DNA repair. Within these processes, OTUB1 reduces the ubiquitylation of target proteins in two distinct ways, either by using its catalytic DUB activity or in a noncatalytic manner by inhibiting the E2-conjugating enzyme. Here, we show that the ubiquitin-like modifier FAT10 regulates OTUB1 stability and functionality in different ways. Covalent FAT10ylation of OTUB1 resulted in its proteasomal degradation, whereas a noncovalent interaction stabilized OTUB1. We provide evidence that OTUB1 interacts directly with FAT10 and the E2-conjugating enzyme USE1. This interaction strongly stimulated OTUB1 DUB activity toward Lys-48–linked diubiquitin. Furthermore, the noncovalent interaction between FAT10 and OTUB1 not only enhanced its isopeptidase activity toward Lys-48–linked ubiquitin moieties but also strengthened its noncatalytic activity in reducing Lys-63 polyubiquitylation of its target protein TRAF3 (TNF receptor–associated factor 3). Additionally, the cellular clearance of overall polyubiquitylation by OTUB1 was strongly stimulated through the presence of FAT10. The addition of FAT10 also led to an increased interaction between OTUB1 and its cognate E2 UbcH5B, implying a function of FAT10 in the inhibition of polyubiquitylation. Overall, these data indicate that FAT10 not only plays a role in covalent modification, leading its substrates to proteasomal degradation, but also regulates the stability and functionality of target proteins by interacting in a noncovalent manner.

FAT10 is thereby able to exert a major influence on ubiquitylation processes. The homeostasis of protein synthesis and degradation under normal and under stress conditions is one of the most tightly regulated processes in mammalian cells. A central regulator of proteostasis is the ubiquitin–proteasome system. Substrate proteins become post-translationally modified by ubiquitin and, depending on chain type and length, are targeted for degradation by the 26S proteasome (1Collins G.A. Goldberg A.L. The logic of the 26S proteasome.Cell. 2017; 169 (28525752): 792-80610.1016/j.cell.2017.04.023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The family of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifiers contains several other members such as SUMO, Nedd8, and ISG15 (2van der Veen A.G. Ploegh H.L. Ubiquitin-like proteins.Annu. Rev.

Although all members share the ubiquitin fold as a structural similarity, the functional consequences of modifications by ubiquitin-like modifiers are extremely diverse (2van der Veen A.G. Ploegh H.L. Ubiquitin-like proteins.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81 (22404627): 323-35710.1146/annurev-biochem-093010-153308Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Protein stability or activity, subcellular localization, or protein-protein interactions are altered as well as regulatory processes such as DNA repair, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis (2van der Veen A.G.

FAT10 (human leukocyte antigen-F (HLA-F) adjacent transcript 10) also belongs to the family of ubiquitin-like proteins, as it possesses two of the conserved β-grasp ubiquitin folds composed in a head-to-tail formation combined by a short linker (4Fan W.

The N- and C-terminal domains of FAT10 share sequence homologies of 29% and 36% with ubiquitin, respectively.

To learn more about the functional consequences of FAT10 interacting covalently and noncovalently with target proteins, we recently performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with USE1 as a bait and a human prey thymus library. While searching for new substrates and interaction partners, we identified members of the ubiquitin conjugation family. One of the candidates was the deubiquitylating enzyme otubain 1 (OTUB1) belonging to the ovarian tumor family (OTU) of cysteine proteases (26Komander D. Clague M.J. Urbé S. Breaking the chains: Structure and function of the deubiquitinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10 (19626045): 550-56310.1038/nrm2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). OTUB1 possesses a specificity to clear Lys-48 polyubiquitin chains from substrate proteins such as the tumor suppressor p53 (26Komander D. Clague M.J. Urbé S. Breaking the chains: Structure and function of the deubiquitinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10 (19626045): 550-56310.1038/nrm2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). The removal of polyubiquitin chains from p53 by OTUB1 prevents p53 from proteasomal degradation and leads to stabilization of the protein (27Sun X.X. Challagundla K.B. Dai M.S. Positive regulation of p53 stability and activity by the deubiquitinating enzyme Otubain 1.EMBO J. 2012; 31 (22124327): 576-59210.1038/emboj.2011.434Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Furthermore, OTUB1 inhibits polyubiquitylation in a noncatalytic manner. Interaction with its cognate E2-conjugating enzymes UbcH5b and Ubc13 leads to suppression of the conjugating activity of the E2 enzymes and thereby to a reduced transfer of ubiquitin onto E3 ligases and substrate proteins (28Juang Y.C.

Because only a few interaction partners of the E2-conjugating enzyme USE1 are known so far and no FAT10 deconjugating enzyme has been published as yet, we investigated several different possibilities of how USE1, FAT10, and OTUB1 could influence each other. We examined whether OTUB1 possesses a deFAT10ylating activity or whether it inhibits FAT10 conjugation by interacting with the E2-conjugating enzyme USE1. We further analyzed whether FAT10 has an impact on the functionality of OTUB1 regarding its isopeptidase activity or its inhibitory noncatalytic activity. In this study, we elucidated USE1 and FAT10 as new interaction partners of OTUB1. We show that the direct interaction of FAT10 with OTUB1 stimulates the OTUB1 isopeptidase activity toward Lys-48–linked diubiquitin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a covalent FAT10ylation of OTUB1 in cellulo and in vitro targets the conjugate for proteasomal degradation, whereas a direct, noncovalent interaction between FAT10 and OTUB1 stabilizes the protein. Thereby, FAT10 positively affects both the catalytic and noncatalytic activities of OTUB1 in reducing the polyubiquitylation of its substrate protein TRAF3 (TNF receptor–associated factor 3) and of the general formation of ubiquitin conjugates in cellulo. Here, we have proposed a new bilateral regulatory effect of FAT10 on its substrate protein OTUB1 whereby it influences its target in both a covalent and noncovalent manner. To search for interaction partners of the FAT10 E2-conjugating enzyme USE1, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using USE1 as bait and a thymus cDNA library as prey (Clontech, Takara; data not shown). Besides candidates for a putative FAT10-specific E3 ligase, we started to investigate the deubiquitylating enzyme (DUB) otubain 1 (OTUB1) as a new interaction partner of USE1. We asked whether OTUB1 might function as a deFAT10ylating enzyme or whether FAT10 and USE1 might regulate the stability and functionality of OTUB1. To confirm OTUB1 as a new interaction partner of USE1, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for His-USE1 and the Flag-tagged OTUB1 versions of the WT, the active-site cysteine mutant (C91S), and an E2 interaction deletion mutant (T134R). The point mutation T134R in the catalytic OTU domain of OTUB1 has been shown to disrupt the interaction with the E2-conjugating enzyme UbcH5B and thereby diminish the inhibitory effect of OTUB1 on ubiquitin conjugation (28Juang Y.C.

Our subsequent co-immunoprecipitation revealed a USE1 interaction with OTUB1 WT as well as with the C91S variant (Fig. 1A). The interaction of OTUB1 T134R with USE1 was reduced (Figs. 1A and S1), supporting a structural similarity between USE1 and UbcH5B as published recently (35Schelpe J. Monté D. Dewitte F. Sixma T.K.

To investigate whether ubiquitin or FAT10 could increase the interaction intensity of OTUB1 and USE1, both proteins were co-expressed in HEK293 cells in the presence or absence of one of the two modifiers (Fig. 1B; data not shown for ubiquitin). Overexpression of FAT10 did not change the interaction between USE1 and OTUB1 compared with the interaction in the absence of FAT10 in cellulo (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6). Likewise, the presence of ubiquitin had also no influence on the interplay between E2 and DUB in this experimental setup (data not shown). As OTUB1 is known to function as a deconjugating enzyme for ubiquitin (26Komander D. Clague M.J. Urbé S. Breaking the chains: Structure and function of the deubiquitinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10 (19626045): 550-56310.1038/nrm2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar), we asked whether OTUB1 could also remove FAT10 from substrate proteins. To answer this question a linear fusion construct (HA-FAT10-USE1) was used to mimic a peptide-linked FAT10ylated USE1. In HEK293 cells this fusion construct was co-expressed in the presence or absence of Flag-tagged OTUB1, and a co-immunoprecipitation with subsequent Western blot analysis was performed (Fig. 1C). Although a high amount of linear HA-FAT10-USE1 was observed (Fig. 1C, top panel), no free HA-FAT10 and thereby no removal of FAT10 from USE1 was detectable, indicating that OTUB1 does not function as a deconjugating enzyme for linearly conjugated FAT10. As it is published that OTUB1 interacts with certain E2-conjugating enzymes when loaded with ubiquitin to regulate ubiquitin conjugation to substrate proteins (28Juang Y.C. Landry M.C. Sanches M.

Western blot analysis against Flag-OTUB1 in the same experimental setup revealed an interaction between OTUB1 and the linear fusion protein (Fig. 1C, middle panel), indicating that OTUB1 still can interact with FAT10 and USE1 when both proteins are bound in a complex. Next, we examined whether OTUB1 was able to clear FAT10 from a known isopeptide-linked substrate. Therefore, HA-UBE1 and FAT10 were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells in the absence or presence of Y2-tagged OTUB1 WT or C91S (C-terminal part of YFP at the N terminus of OTUB1), and a co-immunoprecipitation was performed (Fig. 1D). Western blot analysis detecting FAT10ylated UBE1 did not show any differences in the conjugate amount when either OTUB1 WT or C91S was present (Fig. 1D, lanes 2, 3, and 4). These data supported our finding that OTUB1 does not possess isopeptidase activity toward FAT10ylated proteins. To further confirm this hypothesis, we tested whether the DUB activity of OTUB1 has an impact on the overall FAT10 conjugation to substrate proteins. Flag-tagged OTUB1 variants were overexpressed together with HA-tagged FAT10, and a co-immunoprecipitation with subsequent Western blot analysis was performed. A reduction in the FAT10 conjugation pattern in the presence of OTUB1 WT was not observable (Fig. 2A, middle panel, lanes 2 and 3). FAT10ylation of substrate proteins also was not affected by co-expression of the OTUB1 active-site cysteine mutant C91S or the T134R E2 interaction mutant (Fig. 2A, middle panel, lanes 4 and 5). These data indicate that the new USE1 interaction partner OTUB1 does not function as a deFAT10ylating enzyme in cellulo and that this interaction has no inhibitory effect on the FAT10 conjugation pattern as shown for UbcH5B and ubiquitin conjugation (28Juang Y.C.

Having demonstrated that OTUB1 has no impact on FAT10 conjugation, we wondered whether FAT10 has an influence on OTUB1 stability and functionality. Indeed, in overexpression experiments with Flag-OTUB1 and HA-FAT10 and subsequent co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis, OTUB1 became modified by a single FAT10 moiety (Fig. 2A, top panel). This FAT10ylation still occurred when OTUB1 possessed a point mutation in either the active site (C91S) or the catalytic OTU domain (T134R), indicating that these residues do not have a relation to the FAT10 binding to OTUB1 (Fig. 2A, top panel). To examine the interaction between FAT10 and OTUB1 under endogenous conditions, FAT10 expression was induced by treating HEK293 cells with the proinflammatory cytokines IFNγ and TNFα. An immunoprecipitation of FAT10 with the FAT10-specific mAb 4F1 and subsequent Western blot analysis using a rabbit mAb against OTUB1 were performed. Upon additional inhibition of the 26S proteasome by treatment with MG132 for 6 h, OTUB1 became FAT10ylated under endogenous conditions (Fig. 2B) suggesting a rapid degradation of the conjugate. Next, we tested whether this covalent interaction relies on the C-terminal diglycine motif of FAT10 as shown previously for other proteins targeted by FAT10 (19Aichem A. Pelzer C. Lukasiak S.

The positioning of chromosomes within the nuclear three-dimensional space involves interactions between nuclear lamina (NL) and the lamina-associated domains (LAD). Contact of individual LADs with the NL are dependent upon H3K9me2 introduced by G9a. The mechanisms governing the recruitment of G9a to distinct subcellular sites, into chromatin or to LAD, is not known. The cyclin D1 gene product encodes the regulatory subunit of the holoenzyme that phosphorylates pRB and NRF1 thereby governing cell-cycle progression and mitochondrial metabolism. Herein, we show that cyclin D1 enhanced H3K9 dimethylation though direct association with G9a. Endogenous cyclin D1 was required for the recruitment of G9a to target genes in chromatin, for G9a-induced H3K9me2 of histones, and for NL-LAD interaction. The finding that cyclin D1 is required for recruitment of G9a to target genes in chromatin and for H3K9 dimethylation, identifies a novel mechanism coordinating protein methylation."

To establish findings associated with CFS and those related to co-morbid depression or autonomic dysfunction.Identification and recruitment of participants was identical in both phases, all CFS patients fulfilled Fukuda criteria. In Phase 1 (n = 48) we explored cognitive function in a heterogeneous cohort of CFS patients, investigating links with depressive symptoms (HADS). In phase 2 (n = 51 CFS & n = 20 controls) participants with co-morbid major depression were excluded (SCID). Furthermore, we investigated relationships between cognitive performance and heart rate variability (HRV).Cognitive performance in unselected CFS patients is in average range on most measures. However, 0-23% of the CFS sample fell below the 5th percentile. Negative correlations occurred between depressive symptoms (HAD-S) with Digit-Symbol-Coding (r = -.507, p = .006) and TMT-A (r = -.382, p = .049). In CFS without depression, impairments of cognitive performance remained with significant differences in indices of psychomotor speed (TMT-A: p = 0.027; digit-symbol substitution: p = 0.004; digit-symbol copy: p = 0.007; scanning: p = .034) Stroop test suggested differences due to processing speed rather than inhibition.

While depressive symptoms can be associated with impairments, co-morbidity with major depression is not itself responsible for reductions in cognitive performance. Impaired autonomic control of heart-rate associates with reductions in basic processing speed."

The current study used photo-id data from 2005-2014 to estimate the skin mark pattern on resident bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from the Aeolian Archipelago (Italy). Thirteen skin mark types were identified and their origin, prevalence and permanence time were examined. The pattern of skin marks was assessed for the abundance, richness, distribution and severity in six body regions and compared among age classes, sex and degree of dolphins' interaction with trammel nets (DIN). Our results showed higher prevalence, abundance, richness and distribution of skin marks in adults than in the younger age classes, with the exception of black marks and white ring lesions. The prevalence and abundance of skin marks were higher in males than females, with the exception of scratches and white patches. Moreover, gunshot wounds, mutilations and irregular dorsal fin edges were found only on adult males. Since males showed higher DIN than females and, in dolphins with higher DIN, skin marks were more abundant and frequently distributed in different body regions, the skin mark pattern in regard to DIN seems to be sex-related. The more severe marks were observed on adults, males and dolphins with higher DIN, namely skin disorder, tooth rake marks, small shallow indentations, deep indentations and mutilations. On the contrary, the severity of scratches, white patches and dark ring lesions was higher in females than males, but not significantly related to DIN and age of the individuals. Our results showed that photo-id data provide an efficient and cost-effective approach to document the occurrence of skin marks in free-ranging bottlenose dolphin populations, a critical step toward understanding the cause and supporting the conservation strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2913140176,"Oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) and OSBP-related proteins (ORPs) constitute a family of lipid transfer proteins conserved in eukaryotes. ORP1 transports cholesterol at the interface between the late endosomes/lysosomes (LELs) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ORP1 is targeted to the endosomal membranes by forming a tripartite complex with the LE GTPase Rab7 and its effector RILP (Rab7-interacting lysosomal protein). Here, we determined the crystal structure of human ORP1 ANK domain in complex with the GTP-bound form of Rab7. ORP1 ANK binds to the helix α3 of Rab7 located away from the switching regions, which makes the interaction independent of the nucleotide-binding state of Rab7. Thus, the effector-interacting switch regions of Rab7 are accessible for RILP binding, allowing formation of the ORP1-Rab7-RILP complex. ORP1 ANK binds to Rab7 and the Rab7-RILP complex with similar micro-molar affinities, which is consistent with the independence binding of ORP1 and RILP to Rab7. The structural model of the ORP1-Rab7-RILP complex correlates with the recruitment of ORP1 at the LEL-ER interface and the role in lipid transport and regulation."

It is unknown how CHH-pathogenic mutations in RNase MRP snoRNA interfere with skeletal development, and aberrant processing of RNase MRP substrate RNAs is thought to be involved. We hypothesized that viperin plays a role in chondrogenic differentiation. Using immunohistochemistry, real-time quantitative PCR, immunoblotting, ELISA, siRNA-mediated gene silencing, plasmid-mediated gene overexpression, label-free MS proteomics, and promoter reporter bioluminescence assays, we discovered here that viperin is expressed in differentiating chondrocytic cells and regulates their protein secretion and the outcome of chondrogenic differentiation by influencing transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)/SMAD family 2/3 (SMAD2/3) activity via C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10). Of note, we observed disturbances in this viperin-CXCL10-TGF-β/SMAD2/3 axis in CHH chondrocytic cells.

Given the development of biased ligands that differentially affect canonical versus noncanonical signaling, we examined which signaling pathway mediates 5-HT1BR agonist-induced locomotor perseveration and PPI deficits, behavioral phenotypes observed in both obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To assess the role of canonical 5-HT1BR signaling, mice received acute pretreatment with a GSK-3 inhibitor (SB216763 or AR-A014418) and acute treatment with the 5-HT1A/1B receptor agonist RU24969 prior to assessing perseverative locomotor behavior in the open field, and PPI. To determine the role of noncanonical 5-HT1BR signaling, Arrb2 wild-type (WT), heterozygous (HT), and knockout (KO) mice received acute RU24969 treatment prior to behavioral testing. GSK-3 inhibition increased locomotor perseveration overall, and also failed to influence the RU24969-induced perseverative locomotor pattern in the open field. Yet, GSK-3 inhibition modestly reduced RU24969-induced PPI deficits. On the other hand, Arrb2 HT and KO mice showed reduced locomotion and no changes in perseveration overall, in addition to modest reductions in RU24969-induced locomotion and PPI deficits. In conclusion, our data do not support use of either GSK-3 inhibitors or β-arrestin2 inhibition in treatment of perseverative behaviors."

Indeed, overexpression of PDZK1IP1 inhibited tumor necrosis factor-α–induced G1 arrest via impairment of p21 induction (3Guijarro M.V. Castro M.E. Romero L. Moneo V. Carnero A.

PDZK1IP1 also decreases the c-Myc–mediated caspase3-like activity in Rat1 fibroblasts in low serum to retain the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. Consistently, PDZK1IP1-expressing cells proliferate in nude mice (5Guijarro M.V. Link W. Rosado A. Leal J.F. Carnero A.

Furthermore, an increase in reactive oxygen species has been reported to correlate with tumorigenicity mediated by PDZK1IP1, whereas treatment of PDZK1IP1-expressing cells with antioxidants led to loss of tumorigenicity (6Guijarro M.V.

Recently, PDZK1IP1 was shown to activate Notch signaling to regulate a cancer stem cell pool (7Garcia-Heredia J.M. Lucena-Cacace A. Verdugo-Sivianes E.M. Pérez M. Carnero A.

Furthermore, it was reported that the expression of PDZK1IP1 is correlated with tumorigenicity in lung adenocarcinoma (8Ferrer I. Quintanal-Villalonga Á. Molina-Pinelo S. Garcia-Heredia J.M. Perez M. Suárez R. Ponce-Aix S. Paz-Ares L. Carnero A. MAP17 predicts sensitivity to platinum-based therapy, EGFR inhibitors and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in lung adenocarcinoma.J. Exp. Clin.

Conversely, overexpression of PDZK1IP1 in a colon carcinoma cell line decreased cell growth in vivo and in vitro (1Kocher O. Cheresh P. Lee S.W. Identification and partial characterization of a novel membrane-associated protein (MAP17) up-regulated in human carcinomas and modulating cell replication and tumor growth.Am. J.

Thus, PDZK1IP1 might be involved in tumorigenicity either negatively or positively dependent on the tumor type.

Besides its action in tumorigenicity, PDZK1IP1 interacts with several PDZ domain–containing molecules, including NHERFs (sodium-hydrogen antiporter 3 regulator) 1–4 and NaPiIIa and Na+/H+ hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3; alternatively termed solute carrier family 9A3 (SLC9A3)) (10Lanaspa M.A. Giral H.

Furthermore, PDZK1IP1 can clearly contribute to the internalization of sodium-dependent phosphate transport protein 2b (NaPiIIa; alternatively termed SLC34A1) in the trans-Golgi network (10Lanaspa M.A. Giral H. Breusegem S.Y. Halaihel N. Baile G. Catalán J. Carrodeguas J.A. Barry N.P. Levi M. Sorribas V.

In addition, PDZK1IP1 showed stimulation of Na-dependent transport of mannose and glucose in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cell lines because PDZK1IP1 acted as a required β-subunit for sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) (11Blasco T.

Therefore, PDZK1IP1 is thought to participate in enhancement of the endogenous uphill transport system in the kidney as well. Cancer cells are originally generated from a normal cell via several mutation steps in its genome. Recently, Hanahan and Weinberg (14Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation.Cell. 2011; 144 (21376230): 646-67410.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43102) Google Scholar) proposed that the process of tumorigenicity requires 10 kinds of hallmarks. Among these hallmarks, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is known to suppress cell growth through G1 arrest during the cell cycle and/or apoptosis in normal and premalignant cells, whereas this cytokine can promote tumorigenicity in malignant and metastatic cells via TGF-β–mediated immunosuppression, growth factor production, motility, and angiogenesis when cancer cells lose tumor-suppressive responses to TGF-β (15Seoane J. Gomis R.R. TGF-β family signaling in tumor suppression and cancer progression.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect.

TGF-β is also involved in embryogenesis and tissue homeostasis (17Morikawa M. Derynck R. Miyazono K. TGF-β and the TGF-β family: context-dependent roles in cell and tissue physiology.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8 (27141051)a02187310.1101/cshperspect.a021873Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 18Moses H.L. Roberts A.B. Derynck R.

Thus, TGF-β is considered to be a multifunctional cytokine. TGF-β signaling is mainly mediated via the Smad-dependent pathway. This pathway is initiated through ligand binding to TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII). In the Smad-dependent pathway, constitutively active serine/threonine kinase in the cytoplasmic region of TβRII can phosphorylate the glycine/serine-rich domain in the juxtamembrane region of TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI or ALK5) to activate TβRI serine/threonine kinase. Then the active TβRI kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of TGF-β/activin receptor–regulated-Smads (AR-Smads; i.e. Smad2 and Smad3). The two phosphorylated AR-Smads form a ternary complex with Smad4 to translocate to the nucleus where the complex interacts with myriad transcriptional factors and cofactors to control TGF-β target genes (19Heldin C.H. Moustakas A. Signaling receptors for TGF-β family members.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8 (27481709)a02205310.1101/cshperspect.a022053Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 20Hill C.S.

To date, it has been reported that dysregulation of TGF-β signaling is implicated in development of various diseases, including cancer, fibrosis, and vascular disorders (22Gordon K.J. Blobe G.C. Role of transforming growth factor-β superfamily signaling pathways in human disease.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1782 (18313409): 197-22810.1016/j.bbadis.2008.01.006Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). To avoid excessive TGF-β signaling in cells, therefore, TGF-β signaling is governed by a great number of gatekeepers present from the extracellular microenvironment to the nucleus (23Miyazawa K. Miyazono K. Regulation of TGF-β family signaling by inhibitory Smads.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect.

However, how global fine-tuning of TGF-β signaling in cells is controlled by each molecule is not still understood. In the present study, we explored the role of PDZK1IP1 in the TGF-β pathway and found that PDZK1IP1 is a novel interacting partner with Smad4 to perturb TGF-β signaling. We investigated whether PDZK1IP1 affects the TGF-β signaling using the TGF-β/activin–induced Smad-driven transcriptional (CAGA)12-luc reporter (27Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. Direct binding of Smad3 and Smad4 to critical TGF β-inducible elements in the promoter of human plasminogen activator inhibitor-type 1 gene.EMBO J. 1998; 17 (9606191): 3091-310010.1093/emboj/17.11.3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). PDZK1IP1 dose-dependently inhibited the activity of the luciferase reporter when cells were stimulated with TGF-β (Fig. 1A). We also observed inhibitory actions of PDZK1IP1 on TGF-β–induced reporter activities using p800-Luc (Fig. 1B) and pGL3ti-850-luc (Fig. 1C), both of which possess the enhancer regions of TGF-β target genes (28Keeton M.R. Curriden S.A. van Zonneveld A.J. Loskutoff D.J. Identification of regulatory sequences in the type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor gene responsive to transforming growth factor β.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266 (1744101): 23048-23052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nakano N. Itoh S. Watanabe Y. Maeyama K. Itoh F. Kato M. Requirement of TCF7L2 for TGF-β-dependent transcriptional activation of the TMEPAI gene.J. Biol.

Curiously, we could see the efficiently inhibitory effect of PDZK1IP1 on TGF-β–mediated luciferase activity of both p800-Luc and pGL3ti-850-luc reporters compared with that of the (CAGA)12-luc reporter. Unlike the (CAGA)12-luc reporter that is an artificial promoter including only binding elements for Smad3 and Smad4, both p800-Luc and pGL3ti-850-luc reporters possess natural promoters where other transcription factor(s) except for Smad3 and Smad4 can possibly lie. Thus, it is possible that PDZK1IP1 might also inhibit the function of other transcription factors that can bind to the promoter regions of both p800-Luc and pGL3ti-850-luc reporters. The introduction of Smad4 into MDA-MB468 cells that genetically lack functional Smad4 genes improved TGF-β responsiveness, whereas PDZK1IP1 perturbed TGF-β signaling in MDA-MB468 cells carrying Smad4 (Fig. 1D). Because Smad4 is required for not only the TGF-β/Smad pathway but also the BMP/Smad pathway, the (SBE)4-luc reporter, which is also activated by BMP, was transfected together with PDZK1IP1 in HepG2 cells to investigate whether PDZK1IP1 perturbs the BMP signaling. As seen in Fig. 1E, PDZK1IP1 could counteract BMP signaling as it did TGF-β signaling. Consistently, PDZK1IP1 inhibited the activities of other BMP-induced luciferase reporters, Id-1-luc (Fig. 1F) and (BRE)2-luc (Fig. 1G), upon BMP stimulation. Furthermore, overexpression of PDZK1IP1 (Fig. 1H) revealed marginal inhibition of TGF-β–induced cell migration (Fig. 1I) and significant inhibition of TGF-β–mediated cell growth arrest (Fig. 1J) in A549 cells. These results demonstrated that PDZK1IP1 has the ability to interfere with TGF-β family signaling. Because PDZK1IP1 inhibits TGF-β family signaling, we attempted to determine whether PDZK1IP1 influences Smad phosphorylation induced by the TGF-β family. The results showed that PDZK1IP1 affected neither constitutively active ALK5 (ALK5ca)-mediated Smad2 nor constitutively active ALK6 (ALK6ca)-mediated Smad1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2, A and B). However, PDZK1IP1 interacted with Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 dependent on the ALK5 activation. Particularly, we could observe a strong interaction of PDZK1IP1 with Smad2 and Smad4 (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, its interaction with Smad8 and Smad4 could be detected upon BMP receptor activation (Fig. 2D). Thus, we supposed that PDZK1IP1 mainly interacts with Smad4 to interfere with its downstream signaling. For the above reason, in the following experiments, we took particular note of Smad4 because of its requirement for both the TGF-β and the BMP signaling pathways. Because we were not successful in showing endogenous interaction between PDZK1IP1 and Smad4 using the coimmunoprecipitation assay, we adopted a proximity ligation assay (PLA) to observe their interaction. Without TGF-β stimulation, we could not see any of the red dots that reveal interaction between the two proteins. However, treatment of cells with TGF-β exhibited a remarkable number of red spots (Fig. 3A). When PDZK1IP1 was knocked down in PC-3 cells (Fig. 3B), their interaction was lost even though the cells were treated with TGF-β (Fig. 3C). To confirm their interaction further, we transiently introduced PDZK1IP1/HA into A549 cells and then stained the cells with anti-Smad4 (green) and anti-HA (red) antibodies. Their colocalization could be detected in the cytosol with or without TGF-β stimulation. Although Smad4 is localized in the nucleus upon TGF-β stimulation in the absence of PDZK1IP1, overexpression of PDZK1IP1 retained Smad4 in the cytosol (arrows) (Fig. 3D). These results prompted us to examine whether PDZK1IP1 disturbs the interaction between Smad2 and Smad4 upon TGF-β stimulation. Expectedly, PDZK1IP1 dissociated the ALK5ca-mediated formation of a complex between Smad2 and Smad4 (Fig. 3E). By the same token, ALK6ca-mediated interaction between Smad5 and Smad4 was disrupted by PDZK1IP1 (Fig. 3F).Figure 3Cytosolic retention of Smad4 by PDZK1IP1.

IB, immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To evaluate the functional domain(s) in PDZK1IP1 in terms of its inhibitory activity on TGF-β signaling, we made three mutants: PDZK1IP1Δ(I65–M114), PDZK1IP1Δ(V50–M114), and PDZK1IP1Δ(M1–A49) (Fig. 4A). Among them, PDZK1IP1Δ(M1–A49) lost the ability to inhibit TGF-β signaling, indicating that the N-terminal region of PDZK1IP1 plays a key role in the inhibitory action of TGF-β signaling (Fig. 4B). To further narrow down its functional domain, we made several N-terminal deletion mutants of PDZK1IP1 (Fig. 4C). PDZK1IP1Δ(M1–W30) could still inhibit TGF-β–mediated luciferase activity, although this inhibitory activity was lower than that of the WT (Fig. 4D). Similarly, BMP signaling was also disturbed by PDZK1IP1Δ(M1–W30) (Fig. 4E). Thus, the region between Met31 and Ala49 in PDZK1IP1 is possibly needed for PDZK1IP1 to inhibit TGF-β family signaling. Indeed, the association between PDZK1IP1 mutants and Smad4 became weaker in proportion to loss of the N-terminal length of PDZK1IP1 (Fig. 4F). PDZK1IP1Δ(M1–W30) can adequately interfere with the reporter activity induced by both TGF-β and BMP despite its marginal association with Smad4. Therefore, it is possible that the weak interaction is enough for PDZK1IP1 to inhibit TGF-β family signaling to some extent. When PDZK1IP1Δ(F40–A49) (Fig. 4G) was introduced into cells to examine whether this mutant possesses inhibitory activity, it did not reveal obvious inhibitory activity for TGF-β signaling (Fig. 4H). To further evaluate whether this 10-amino acid–long region derived from PDZK1IP1 is sufficient to bind to Smad4, we performed a GST pulldown assay using GST-PDZK1IP1(M1–A49) and GST–PDZK1IP1(F40-A49) (Fig. 4I). Smad4 could obviously bind to both GST-PDZK1IP1(M1–A49) and GST-PDZK1IP1(F40–A49), unlike Smad2 and Smad3. These results demonstrated that this 10-amino acid–long region is enough for PDZK1IP1 to interact with Smad4 (Fig. 4J). To test which domain of Smad4 is able to interact with PDZK1IP1, we used several Smad4 mutants: MH1 alone (Smad4A), MH1 + linker (Smad4B), linker + MH2 (Smad4C), MH2 alone (Smad4D), and linker alone (Smad4L) (Fig. 5A). Among them, Smad4A and Smad4B could show obvious interaction with PDZK1IP1, although the strong nonspecific band corresponding to PDZK1IP1 could be seen when Smad4B was transfected. In addition, Smad4D revealed interaction with PDZK1IP1. In contrast, the interaction of PDZK1IP1 with Smad4C and Smad4L could not be detected (Fig. 5B). Thus, the MH1 domain of Smad4 seems a main part to interact with PDZK1IP1, although its MH2 domain somewhat possesses the ability to associate with PDZK1IP1. Therefore, there is a possibility that the linker region of Smad4 hinders the interaction between Smad4 MH1 (or MH2) and PDZK1IP1 because of its steric configuration and that the MH2 domain of Smad4 might support Smad4 to associate with PDZK1IP1. Because the peptide from Phe40 to Ala49 of PDZK1IP1 bound to Smad4 (Fig. 4J), we were prompted to examine whether this peptide were able to catch Smad4 MH1. We definitely showed that only MH1 domain of Smad4 interacts with this peptide (Fig. 5C). Thus, it is possible that the full length of PDZK1IP1 associates with Smad4 MH1 to undertake steric hindrance for the interaction between receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) and Smad4. Because overexpression of PDZK1IP1 blocked TGF-β signaling, the decreased expression of PDZK1IP1 supposedly enhances it. For that purpose, we established two cell lines (sh-1 and sh-3) in which PDZK1IP1 expression was drastically lowered (Fig. 6A). Indeed, shRNA-mediated depletion of PDZK1IP1 could enhance the mRNA expression of Smad7 and TMEPAI, which are well-known direct target genes for TGF-β signaling (30Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Morén A.

We also tested whether loss of function for PDZK1IP1 augmented TGF-β–mediated cell migration (Fig. 6D). One of the PDZK1IP1-knocked down cells line, sh-1, showed an obvious increase of migration activity in both the absence and presence of TGF-β compared with the pLKO.1-transfected control cell line. Conversely, highly basal migration activity in sh-3–carrying cells was seen, although TGF-β could not further enhance migration activity in sh-3–carrying cells.

Our paper documents an asymmetric effect of capital structure on firms’ competitiveness in a sample of Chinese firms. Firms whose capital structure is characterized by a low leverage but rapid leverage growth has a dominant position in their product market. The industry average leverage ratio is also a critical factor influencing firms’ competitiveness. High debt levels hinder firms’ competitiveness. The influence of capital structure on firms’ product-market competitiveness varies based on the extent of industry concentration. In highly concentrated industries, high leverage level and slow leverage growth suppress firms’ competitiveness to a larger extent compared with industries with low concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2913858879,"Urine holds great promise as a non-invasive sampling method for molecular diagnostics. The cell-free nucleic acids of urine however are small, labile, and difficult to purify. Here an efficient method for the purification of these nucleic acids is presented. An empirically derived protocol was devised by first identifying conditions that allowed recovery of a 100 base pair (bp) DNA, followed by optimization using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay. The resulting method efficiently purifies both small sized DNAs and RNAs from urine, which when combined with quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRTPCR), demonstrably improves detection sensitivity. Fractionation experiments reveal that nucleic acids in urine exist both in the cell-free and cellular fraction, roughly in equal proportion. Consistent with previous studies, amplicons > 180bp show a marked loss in PCR sensitivity for cell-free nucleic acids. Finally, the lysis buffer developed here also doubles as an effective preservative, protecting against nucleic acid degradation for at least two weeks under simulated field conditions. With this method, volumes of up to 25ml of whole urine can be purified in a high-throughput and cost-effective manner. Coupled with its ability to purify both DNA and RNA, the described method may have broad applicability for improving the diagnostic utility of urine, particularly for the detection of low abundant targets."

https://openalex.org/W2911924762,"Central place foraging theory (CPF) has been used to predict the optimal patch residence time for air-breathing marine predators in response to patch quality. Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) forage on densely aggregated prey, which may induce drastic change in prey density in a single feeding event. Thus, the decision whether to leave or stay after each feeding event in a single dive in response to this drastic change, should have a significant effect on prey exploitation efficiency. However, whether humpback whales show adaptive behavior in response to the diminishing prey density in a single dive has been technically difficult to test. Here, we studied the foraging behavior of humpback whales in response to change in prey density in a single dive and calculated the efficiency of each foraging dive using a model based on CPF approach. Using animal-borne accelerometers and video loggers attached to whales, foraging behavior and change in relative prey density in front of the whales were successfully quantified. Results showed diminishing rate of energy intake in consecutive feeding events, and humpback whales efficiently fed by bringing the rate of energy intake close to maximum in a single dive cycle. This video-based method also enabled us to detect the presence of other animals around the tagged whales, showing an interesting trend in behavioral changes where feeding duration was shorter when other animals were present. Our results have introduced a new potential to quantitatively investigate the effect of other animals on free-ranging top predators in the context of optimal foraging theory."
https://openalex.org/W2913103148,"RNA polymerase II (Pol II) has an intrinsic fidelity control mechanism to maintain faithful genetic information transfer during transcription. 8-Oxo-guanine (8OG), a commonly occurring damaged guanine base, promotes misincorporation of adenine into the RNA strand. Recent structural work has shown that adenine can pair with the syn conformation of 8OG directly upstream of the Pol II active site. However, it remains unknown how 8OG is accommodated in the active site as a template base for the incoming ATP. Here, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate two consecutive steps that may contribute to the adenine misincorporation by Pol II. First, the mismatch is located in the active site, contributing to initial incorporation of adenine. Second, the mismatch is in the adjacent upstream position, contributing to extension from the mismatched bp. These results are supported by an in vitro transcription assay, confirming that 8OG can induce adenine misincorporation. Our simulations further suggest that 8OG forms a stable bp with the mismatched adenine in both the active site and the adjacent upstream position. This stability predominantly originates from hydrogen bonding between the mismatched adenine and 8OG in a noncanonical syn conformation. Interestingly, we also found that an unstable bp present directly upstream of the active site, such as adenine paired with 8OG in the canonical anti conformation, largely disrupts the stability of the active site. Our findings have uncovered two main factors contributing to how 8OG induces transcriptional errors and escapes Pol II transcriptional fidelity control checkpoints.

https://openalex.org/W2911383196,"With wetlands categorized as one of the three major ecosystems, the study of wetland health has global environmental implications. Multiple regression models were employed to establish relationships between Landsat-8 images, vegetation indices and field measured biomass in the Yellow River Delta Nature Reserve. These models were then used to estimate the spatial distribution of wetland vegetative biomass. The relationships between wetland vegetative biomass and soil factors (organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, water soluble salt, pH and moisture) were modeled. We were able to achieve higher correlations and improved model fits using vegetative indices and spectral bands 1–5 as independent variables. Several important soil factors were isolated, including soil moisture and salt concentrations, which affect wetland biomass spatial distributions. Overall, wetland biomass decreased from land to the ocean and from the river courses outward."
https://openalex.org/W2914155964,"The arsenic contamination of ground water in visceral leishmaniasis (VL) endemic areas in Bihar, India leads to human exposure through drinking water. Possibly, the consumed arsenic (As) accumulates in the tissues of VL patients, who subsequently internalize intracellular amastigotes to confer resistance against chemotherapy to the parasite, leading to modulation in the host’s immune response. This hypothesis appears to be consistent with the in vitro findings that in arsenic-exposed parasites, the mitochondrial membrane potential became depolarized, whereas the reduced thiol and lactate production was overexpressed with enhanced glucose consumption; therefore, the reduced thiol possibly supports an immunosuppressive state in the host cells. This observation was well supported by the down-regulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-12, IFN-γ, and TNF-α) with a suppressed anti-leishmanial function of macrophage (NO, ROS). In contrast, the pathophysiological mechanism of VL has received ample support by the promotion of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) in the presence of arsenic-exposed Leishmania parasites (LdAS). Dysfunction of mitochondria and the overexpression of lactate production raise the possibility of the Warburg effect being operative through the up-regulation of glucose consumption by parasites to enhance the energy production, possibly augmenting virulence. Therefore, we surmise from our data that arsenic exposure to Leishmania donovani modulates the immune response and infection pattern by impairing parasite function, which may affect the anti-leishmanial effect in VL."
https://openalex.org/W2914622300,"Histopathologic examination of melanocytic neoplasms can be challenging and subjective, with no specific circulating or tissue-based biomarkers currently available. Recently, a circulating 38-microRNA profile of melanoma (Mel38) was described. In this study, Mel38 expression and its impact on downstream mRNA regulation in solid tissue is examined.Mel38 was applied to archival, clinically-annotated, solid-tissue genomic datasets representing benign naevi, primary and metastatic melanoma. Statistical analysis of the signature in relation to disease status, patient outcome and molecular pathways was performed.Mel38 is able to stratify genomic data from solid tissue biopsies on the basis of disease status and differences in melanoma-specific survival. Experimentally-verified messenger-RNA targets of Mel38 also exhibit prognostic expression patterns and represent key molecular pathways and events in melanoma development and progression.The Mel38 microRNA profile may have diagnostic and prognostic utility in solid tissue as well as being a robust circulating biomarker of melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2912536891,"Although many studies revealed that emotions and their dynamics have a profound impact on cognition and behavior, it has proven difficult to unobtrusively measure emotions. In the current study, our objective was to distinguish different experiences elicited by audiovisual stimuli designed to evoke particularly happy, sad, fear and disgust emotions, using electroencephalography (EEG) and a multivariate approach. We show that we were able to classify these emotional experiences well above chance level. Importantly, we retained all the information (frequency and topography) present in the data. This allowed us to interpret the differences between emotional experiences in terms of component psychological processes such as attention and arousal that are known to be associated with the observed activation patterns. In addition, we illustrate how this method of classifying emotional experiences can be applied on a moment-by-moment basis in order to track dynamic changes in the emotional response over time. The application of our approach may be of value in many contexts in which the experience of a given stimulus or situation changes over time, ranging from clinical to consumption settings."
https://openalex.org/W2912099272,"Cellular systems shift metabolic states by adjusting gene expression and enzyme activities to adapt to physiological and environmental changes. Biochemical and genetic studies are identifying how metabolic regulation affects the selection of metabolic phenotypes. However, how metabolism influences its regulatory architecture still remains unexplored. We present a new method of extreme pathway analysis (the minimal set of conically independent metabolic pathways) to deduce regulatory structures from pure pathway information. Applying our method to metabolic networks of human red blood cells and Escherichia coli, we shed light on how metabolic regulation are organized by showing which reactions within metabolic networks are more prone to transcriptional or allosteric regulation. Applied to a human genome-scale metabolic system, our method detects disease-associated reactions. Thus, our study deepens the understanding of the organizing principle of cellular metabolic regulation and may contribute to metabolic engineering, synthetic biology, and disease treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2912133737,"Reading research uses different tasks to investigate different levels of the reading process, such as word recognition, syntactic parsing, or semantic integration. It seems to be tacitly assumed that the underlying cognitive process that constitute reading are stable across those tasks. However, nothing is known about what happens when readers switch from one reading task to another. The stability assumptions of the reading process suggest that the cognitive system resolves this switching between two tasks quickly. Here, we present an alternative language-game hypothesis (LGH) of reading that begins by treating reading as a softly-assembled process and that assumes, instead of stability, context-sensitive flexibility of the reading process. LGH predicts that switching between two reading tasks leads to longer lasting phase-transition like patterns in the reading process. Using the nonlinear-dynamical tool of recurrence quantification analysis, we test these predictions by examining series of individual word reading times in self-paced reading tasks where native (L1) and second language readers (L2) transition between random word and ordered text reading tasks. We find consistent evidence for phase-transitions in the reading times when readers switch from ordered text to random-word reading, but we find mixed evidence when readers transition from random-word to ordered-text reading. In the latter case, L2 readers show moderately stronger signs for phase-transitions compared to L1 readers, suggesting that familiarity with a language influences whether and how such transitions occur. The results provide evidence for LGH and suggest that the cognitive processes underlying reading are not fully stable across tasks but exhibit soft-assembly in the interaction between task and reader characteristics."
