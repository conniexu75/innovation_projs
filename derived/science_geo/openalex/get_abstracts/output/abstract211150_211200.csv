After simultaneously grasping and viewing the object, the observers were required to indicate their impression of it by drawing it or by matching another object to it. The results reveal that vision is strongly dominant, often without the observer's being aware of a conflict."

This finding supports the hypothesis that there is independent control of the synthesis of alpha-chains."

https://openalex.org/W2011800129,"CHROMOSOMAL and non-chromosomal mutations to streptomycin resistance have been described in Chlamydomonas reinhardi1–3. The chromosomal mutants, sr-1, are resistant to low levels of streptomycin (50–100 µg/ml.), possess a Mendelian pattern of inheritance, are closely linked or allelic, and lie in the left arm of linkage group IX. The non-chromosomal mutants, sr-2, are resistant to high levels of streptomycin (500 µg/ml.) and exhibit a uniparental pattern of inheritance. When a mating is made between wild-type cells (ss) and cells of an sr-2 mutant, all the progeny in each tetrad are, with rare exceptions1,4, endowed with the resistance-level of the mating type plus (mt+) parent. The purpose of the present communication is to show that this pattern breaks down when diploids are made between sr-2 and ss cells and that a large proportion of the diploid clones segregate both resistant and sensitive cells during vegetative growth."
https://openalex.org/W224778184,"IN a recent publication1, α1-acid glycoprotein, a human plasma glycoprotein, was shown to be polymorphic. At pH 2.9, that is, near its isoelectric point, seven zones were observed if the mentioned protein had been isolated from pooled normal blood. Moreover, it could be demonstrated that, following enzymatic removal of essentially all sialic acid, the modified pooled α1-acid glycoprotein resolved at pH 4.8 into two major and a minor faster moving component2."

https://openalex.org/W2022258604,"THAT mosquitoes may feed on flowers and sources of food other than blood has been observed many times. Notable among these observations are those of Wesenberg-Lund1, Haeger2, West and Jenkins3, and Sandholm and Price4. Mosquitoes which visit flowers in greatest numbers are various species of Aedes. According to most of the observations recorded, the food consumed is liquid or semi-liquid. The only reference to indicate that mosquitoes may be able to feed on dry food was found in a paper by Downs and Arizmendi5 on colonization of Mexican anophelines. These two authors substituted powdered sugar for honey solutions which they normally supplied to the colonies and noted that females more readily took blood after having fed on powdered sugar. They did not further elaborate on this part of their work, and there was no mention of how the powdered sugar was presented to the mosquitoes."

https://openalex.org/W2052034547,"THE availability of highly purified rare earths, elements 21 and 58–71, has stimulated interest in their chemical and physical properties1. Haley et al.2–6 have examined their biological effects and reported that although they can produce non-specific liver damage they exert their greatest toxicity on the ocular and dermal tissues. However, even this damage can be repaired with time and results in no permanent injury. Recently, it was observed that the intradermal injection in guinea pigs of 0.05 ml. aqueous solutions of 1 × 104−1 × 106 concentrations of praseodymium, neodymium, europium, dysprosium, hol-mium, erbium or lutetium chlorides resulted in the formation of 2-mm diameter nodules containing crystalline deposits (Fig. 1). Observation for periods of 45 days showed no decrease in nodule size or any resorption of the crystalline deposits."
https://openalex.org/W2031672035,"THE content of deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA) in non-dividing somatic cells is believed to be constant1,2. For this reason the nucleic acid content is a reference standard in several biochemical investigations. On the other hand, there are few data which lead to the conclusion that DNA content is not very constant3 and one has to assume that DNA occurs also in a metabolic form4."

https://openalex.org/W1970893970,"THE concept of the relative biological efficiency of different radiations is one that has considerable practical and theoretical interest, and an extensive literature exists which describes in detail the problems of the determination and interpretation of relative biological efficiencies1. Variations in the relative biological efficiency of different radiations are attributable to differences in their ion density or linear energy transfer, defined as the rate of energy loss in eV/μ of irradiated material. Recently an opportunity arose at this laboratory to determine the relative biological efficiency of a highly energetic radiation with low linear energy transfer characteristics—an almost pure beam of μ- mesons. These have a mass of about 200me, one negative charge, and an energy range in this experiment of 2–8 GeV (with a peak at 4–6 GeV)."

The implications of the results of this study and previous studies on similar material are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2090867332,"EXTENDED maintenance in vitro of rumen oligotrich protozoa has been reported by Coleman1. Similar results have not been achieved with the rumen holotrich protozoa2. Coleman1 suggested that to accomplish maintenance of the oligotrich protozoa satisfactorily, it was desirable to control the numbers of bacteria present rather than to eliminate them. One of the principal differences between oligotrich and holotrich protozoa is that the former ingests and then digests starch granules, while holotrichs utilize mainly soluble carbohydrates3. In view of this fact, it would seem possible that competition between bacteria and protozoa for available substrate may be greater in the case of holotrichs than with oligotrichs."

For giant axons in the steady state the coefficient of distribution (Q = Cin/Cout, where Cin and Cout represent respectively intra- and extra-cellular concentration) for the acid dye (cyanole) was found to be 0.12 with the external dye concentration varying from 0.1 to 1.0 per cent (ref. 3). At the same time the coefficient of distribution of the basic dye (neutral red) changed from 5.5 to 0.65 on a corresponding increase in Cout from 0.004 to 0.16 per cent (ref. 2)."
