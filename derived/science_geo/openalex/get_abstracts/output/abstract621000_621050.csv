https://openalex.org/W2898236851,"Digital soil mapping has been widely used to develop statistical models of the relationships between environmental variables and soil attributes. This study aimed at determining and mapping the spatial distribution of the variability in soil chemical properties of the agricultural floodplain lands of the Bara district in Nepal. The study was carried out in 23 Village Development Committees with 12,516 ha total area, in the southern part of the Bara district. A total of 109 surface soil samples (0 to 15 cm depth) were collected and analyzed for pH, organic matter (OM), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P, expressed as P2O5), potassium (K, expressed as K2O), zinc (Zn), and boron (B) status. Descriptive statistics showed that most of the measured soil chemical variables (other than pH and P2O5) were skewed and non-normally distributed and logarithmic transformation was then applied. A geostatistical tool, kriging, was used in ArcGIS to interpolate measured values for those variables and several digital map layers were developed based on each soil chemical property. Geostatistical interpolation identified a moderate spatial variability for pH, OM, N, P2O5, and a weak spatial variability for K2O, Zn, and B, depending upon the use of amendments, fertilizing methods, and tillage, along with the inherent characteristics of each variable. Exponential (pH, OM, N, and Zn), Spherical (K2O and B), and Gaussian (P2O5) models were fitted to the semivariograms of the soil variables. These maps allow farmers to assess existing farm soils, thus allowing them to make easier and more efficient management decisions and maintain the sustainability of productivity."
https://openalex.org/W2898301137,"Defining worldwide human genetic variation is a critical step to reveal how genome plasticity contributes to disease. Yet, there is currently no metric to assess the representativeness and completeness of current and widely used data on genetic variation. We show here that Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) genes can serve as such metric as they are both the most polymorphic and the most studied genetic system. As a test case, we investigated the 1,000 Genomes Project panel. Using high-accuracy in silico HLA typing, we find that over 20% of the common HLA variants and over 70% of the rare HLA variants are missing in this reference panel for worldwide genetic variation, due to undersampling and incomplete geographical coverage, in particular in Oceania and West Asia. Because common and rare variants both contribute to disease, this study thus illustrates how HLA diversity can detect and help fix incomplete sampling and hence accelerate efforts to draw a comprehensive overview of the genetic variation that is relevant to health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2898306713,"The aim of this study was to identify anatomical indication ranges for different lateral wall cochlear implant electrodes to support surgeons in the preoperative preparation.272 patients who were implanted with a FLEX20, FLEX24, FLEX28, or a custom-made device (CMD) were included in this study. The cochlear duct length (CDL) and basal cochlear diameter (length A) were measured within preoperative imaging data. The parameter A was then employed to additionally compute CDL estimates using literature approaches. Moreover, the inserted electrode length (IEL) and insertion angle (IA) were measured in postoperative CT data. By combining the preoperative measurements with the IA data, the covered cochlea length (CCL) and relative cochlear coverage (CC) were determined for each cochlea.The measurements of the CDL show comparable results to previous studies. While CDL measurements and estimations cover similar ranges overall, severe deviations occur in individual cases. The electrode specific IEL and CCL are fairly consistent and increase with longer electrodes, but relatively wide ranges of electrode specific CC values were found due to the additional dependence on the respective CDL. Using the correlation of IEL and CCL across electrode arrays, CDL ranges for selected arrays were developed (FLEX24: 31.3-34.4, FLEX28: 36.2-40.1, FLEXSoft: 40.6-44.9).Our analysis shows that electrode specific CC varies due to the CDL variation. Preoperative measurement of the CDL allows for an individualized implant length selection yielding optimized stimulation and a reduced risk of intraoperative trauma. The CDL, as derived from preoperative CT imaging studies, can help the implant surgeon select the appropriate electrode array to maximize the patient's outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2898346350,"The centromere specific histone H3 variant CENP-A/CENH3 specifies where the kinetochore is formed in most eukaryotes. Despite tight regulation of CENP-A levels in normal cells, overexpression of CENP-A is a feature shared by various types of solid tumors and results in its mislocalization to non-centromeric DNA. How CENP-A is assembled ectopically and the consequences of this mislocalization remain topics of high interest. Here, we report that in human colon cancer cells, the H3.3 chaperones HIRA and DAXX promote ectopic CENP-A deposition. Moreover, the correct balance between levels of the centromeric chaperone HJURP and CENP-A is essential to preclude ectopic assembly by H3.3 chaperones. In addition, we find that ectopic localization can recruit kinetochore components, and correlates with mitotic defects and DNA damage in G1 phase. Finally, CENP-A occupancy at the 8q24 locus is also correlated with amplification and overexpression of the MYC gene within that locus. Overall, these data provide insights into the causes and consequences of histone variant mislocalization in human cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2951278863,"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV), is a viral hemorrhagic fever with a high case fatality rate. Favipiravir was reported to be effective in the treatment of SFTSV infection in vivo in type I interferon receptor knockout (IFNAR−/−) mice at treatment dosages of both 60 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day for a duration of 5 days. In this study, the efficacy of favipiravir at dosages of 120 mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day against SFTSV infection in an IFNAR−/− mouse infection model was investigated. IFNAR−/− mice were subcutaneously infected with SFTSV at a 1.0 × 106 50% tissue culture infectious dose followed by twice daily administration of favipiravir, comprising a total dose of either 120 mg/kg/day or 200 mg/kg/day. The treatment was initiated either immediately post infection or at predesignated time points post infection. Neutralizing antibodies in the convalescent-phase mouse sera was examined by the pseudotyped VSV system. All mice treated with favipiravir at dosages of 120 mg/kg/day or 200 mg/kg/day survived when the treatment was initiated at no later than 4 days post infection. A decrease in body weight of mice was observed when the treatment was initiated at 3–4 days post infection. Furthermore, all control mice died. The body weight of mice did not decrease when treatment with favipiravir was initiated immediately post infection at dosages of 120 mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in the convalescent-phase mouse sera. Similar to the literature-reported peritoneal administration of favipiravir at 300 mg/kg/day, the oral administration of favipiravir at dosages of 120 mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day to IFNAR−/− mice infected with SFTSV was effective."
https://openalex.org/W2894796701,"Developments in information technology offer opportunities to enhance medication safety in primary care. We evaluated the implementation and adoption of a complex pharmacist-led intervention involving the use of an electronic audit and feedback surveillance dashboard to identify patients potentially at risk of hazardous prescribing or monitoring of medicines in general practices. The intervention aimed to create a rapid learning health system for medication safety in primary care. This study aimed to explore how the intervention was implemented, adopted and embedded into practice using a qualitative process evaluation.Twenty two participants were purposively recruited from eighteen out of forty-three general practices receiving the intervention as well as clinical commissioning group staff across Salford UK, which reflected the range of contexts in which the intervention was implemented. Interviews explored how pharmacists and GP staff implemented the intervention and how this affected care practice. Data analysis was thematic with emerging themes developed into coding frameworks based on Normalisation Process Theory (NPT).Engagement with the dashboard involved a process of sense-making in which pharmacists considered it added value to their work. The intervention helped to build respect, improve trust and develop relationships between pharmacists and GPs. Collaboration and communication between pharmacists and clinicians was primarily initiated by pharmacists and was important for establishing the intervention. The intervention operated as a rapid learning health system as it allowed for the evidence in the dashboard to be translated into changes in work practices and into transformations in care.Our study highlighted the importance of the combined use of information technology and the role of pharmacists working in general practice settings. Medicine optimisation activities in primary care may be enhanced by the implementation of a pharmacist-led electronic audit and feedback system. This intervention established a rapid learning health system that swiftly translated data from electronic health records into changes in practice to improve patient care. Using NPT provided valuable insights into the ways in which developing relationships, collaborations and communication between health professionals could lead to the implementation, adoption and sustainability of the intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2898156587,"Objective Medication administration errors (MAEs) are a common risk to patient safety in mental health hospitals, but an absence of in-depth studies to understand the underlying causes of these errors limits the development of effective remedial interventions. This study aimed to investigate the causes of MAEs affecting inpatients in a mental health National Health Service (NHS) hospital in the North West of England. Methods Registered and student mental health nurses working in inpatient psychiatric units were identified using a combination of direct advertisement and incident reports and invited to participate in semi-structured interviews utilising the critical incident technique. Interviews were designed to capture the participants’ experiences of inpatient MAEs. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and subject to framework analysis to illuminate the underlying active failures, error/violation-provoking conditions and latent failures according to Reason’s model of accident causation. Results A total of 20 participants described 26 MAEs (including 5 near misses) during the interviews. The majority of MAEs were skill-based slips and lapses (n = 16) or mistakes (n = 5), and were caused by a variety of interconnecting error/violation-provoking conditions relating to the patient, medicines used, medicines administration task, health care team, individual nurse and working environment. Some of these local conditions had origins in wider organisational latent failures. Recurrent and influential themes included inadequate staffing levels, unbalanced staff skill mix, interruptions/distractions, concerns with how the medicines administration task was approached and problems with communication. Conclusions To our knowledge this is the first published in-depth qualitative study to investigate the underlying causes of specific MAEs in a mental health hospital. Our findings revealed that MAEs may arise due to multiple interacting error and violation provoking conditions and latent ‘system’ failures, which emphasises the complexity of this everyday task facing practitioners in clinical practice. Future research should focus on developing and testing interventions which address key local and wider organisational ‘systems’ failures to reduce error."
https://openalex.org/W2898386049,"The experience of social stress during adolescence is associated with higher vulnerability to drug use. Increases in the acquisition of cocaine self-administration, in the escalation of cocaine-seeking behavior, and in the conditioned rewarding effects of cocaine have been observed in rodents exposed to repeated social defeat (RSD). In addition, prolonged or severe stress induces a proinflammatory state with microglial activation and increased cytokine production. The aim of the present work was to describe the long-term effects induced by RSD during adolescence on the neuroinflammatory response and synaptic structure by evaluating different glial and neuronal markers. In addition to an increase in the conditioned rewarding effects of cocaine, our results showed that RSD in adolescence produced inflammatory reactivity in microglia that is prolonged into adulthood, affecting astrocytes and neurons of two reward-processing areas of the brain (the prelimbic cortex, and the nucleus accumbens core). Considered as a whole these results suggest that social stress experience modulates vulnerability to suffer a loss of glia-supporting functions and neuronal functional synaptic density due to drug consumption in later life."
https://openalex.org/W2898532521,"More than 70 human adenovirus types were identified divided into 7 different species (A-G). Diseases caused by human adenoviruses are type-dependent and can range from mild to severe respiratory infections, gastrointestinal infections or eye infections such as epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. Unfortunately there is no specific anti-adenovirus therapy available. Here we addressed the question whether treatment with cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) for anti-adenoviral therapy such as virus-mediated ulcerations may be feasible. CAP has already been explored for the treatment of dermatological diseases such as chronic wounds. To investigate whether CAP is an effective antiviral tool, purified human adenovirus types derived from different human adenovirus species (HAdV -4, -5, -20, -35, -37, -50) tagged with luciferase were treated with defined dosages of plasma. The CAP treatment was varied by incrementally increasing the time span of CAP treatment. After CAP treatment, the virus containing solution was added to eukaryotic cells and the viral load was determined by measurement of luciferase expression levels. Through the plasma treatment the adenovirus driven luciferase expression directly correlating with adenovirus transduction efficiencies could be reduced for HAdV-5 and HAdV-37. Plasma treatment had no influence on adenovirus derived luciferase expression levels for HAdV-4 and HAdV-50 and it even had a positive effect on luciferase expression levels for HAdV-20 and HAdV-35. These results suggest that CAP has a type dependent effect on adenoviruses and that infectivity can be even increased for certain adenovirus types. Further studies should address the mechanisms behind this phenomenon. In summary we demonstrate that CAP may represent an interesting option for antiviral treatment in a virus type dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2898315671,"Objective We characterized the dynamics of eosinophils in blood and in the infarcted myocardium in patients and in a swine model of reperfused myocardial infarction (MI). The association of eosinophil dynamics with various outcomes was assessed. Methods Serial eosinophil count and pre-discharge cardiac magnetic resonance were carried out in a prospective series of 620 patients with a first ST-elevation MI. In a swine model of reperfused MI, the dynamics of circulating eosinophils and their presence in the infarcted myocardium were determined. In autopsies from chronic MI patients, eosinophils were quantified. Results Patient eosinophil count sharply decreased 12h post-reperfusion compared to arrival. A lower minimum eosinophil count was associated with more extensive edema, microvascular obstruction, and infarct size as measured by cardiac magnetic resonance, and also with a higher rate of cardiac events (death, re-infarction, or heart failure) during follow-up. In the experimental model, eosinophil count boosted during ischemia and dropped back immediately post-reperfusion. Myocardial samples revealed progressive eosinophil migration into the infarcted myocardium, especially areas with microvascular obstruction. Markers of eosinophil maturation and survival (interleukin-5), degranulation (eosinophil cationic protein) and migration (eotoxin-1) were detected in the blood of patients, and in porcine myocardium. Eosinophil infiltration was detected in autopsies from chronic MI patients. Conclusion Eosinopenia post-MI was associated with an impaired cardiac structure and adverse events. The decay in circulating eosinophils soon after reperfusion mirrors their migration into the infarcted myocardium, as reflected by their presence in heart samples from swine and patients. Further studies are needed to understanding this unexplored pathway and its therapeutic implications."
https://openalex.org/W2898168387,"Asymptomatic colonization with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae has been described for humans, various mammal species, and birds. Here, antimicrobial resistant bacteria were recovered from dog feces originating in Germany, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Croatia, and Ukraine, with a subset of mostly E. coli isolates obtained from a longitudinal collection over twelve months. In vitro antimicrobial resistance testing revealed various patterns of resistance against single or all investigated beta-lactam antibiotics, with none of the 101 isolates resistant against two tested carbapenem antibiotics. Whole genome sequence analysis revealed bacteria species-specific patterns for 23 antimicrobial resistance coding DNA sequences (CDS) that were unapparent from the in vitro analysis alone. Phylogenetic analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) revealed clonal bacterial isolates originating from different dogs, suggesting transmission between dogs in the same community. However, individual resistant E. coli clones were not detected over a period longer than seven days. Multi locus sequence typing (MLST) of 85 E. coli isolates revealed 31 different sequence types (ST) with an accumulation of ST744 (n = 9), ST10 (n = 8), and ST648 (n = 6), although the world-wide hospital-associated CTX-M beta-lactamase producing ST131 was not detected. Neither the antimicrobial resistance CDSs patterns nor the phylogenetic analysis revealed an epidemiological correlation among the longitudinal isolates collected from a period longer than seven days. No genetic linkage could be associated with the geographic origin of isolates. In conclusion, healthy dogs frequently carry ESBL-producing bacteria, independent to prior treatment, which may be transmitted between individual dogs of the same community. Otherwise, these antimicrobial resistant bacteria share few commonalities, making their presence eerily unpredictable."
https://openalex.org/W2898509099,"Previous studies have shown that the CB1 receptor antagonist reverses steatohepatitis and its related features of metabolic syndrome, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, the beneficial effects of CB1 receptor blockade on hepatic steatosis and inflammation have not been investigated independently of its effects on body weight and glycemic control. At 32 weeks of age, OLETF rats were administered with rimonabant (10 mg·kg−1·day−1) by oral gavage for 6 weeks. No significant changes in body weight, OGTT, and serum glucose were observed in spite of rimonabant-decreased food intake. Moreover, there was a significant difference between initial and final body weight, regardless of rimonabant administration, indicating that OLETF rats were severely diabetic rats. Rimonabant administration significantly decreased serum liver enzyme levels such as ALT and AST, hepatic fat accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and cell death as demonstrated by the number of TUNEL-positive cells in severely uncontrolled diabetic OLETF rats. Significant decreases in hepatic gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines (CD11b, F4/80, MCP1, and TNFα), negative inflammatory mediators (SOCS1 and SOCS3), and fibrosis-related proteins (TGFβ, collagen 1, and TIMP1) were found in rimonabant-treated OLETF rats. Six-week administration of rimonabant significantly upregulated mRNA levels of CPT1α and PPARα related to β-oxidation. Moreover, significant increases in Nrf2 gene expression and its downstream genes, NQO1, GSAT, HO-1, and TXNRD1 along with increased AMPK phosphorylation were noted in uncontrolled diabetic rats treated with rimonabant. The observed potent inhibitory effects of CB1 receptor blockade on hepatic fat infiltration and cellular death in severely uncontrolled diabetic rats indicate that CB1 receptor is a possible therapeutic target. Increased Nrf2 and AMPK phosphorylation may play a role in the mechanism of rimonabant action."
https://openalex.org/W2898165195,"Storm surge is often the greatest threat to life and critical infrastructures during hurricanes and violent storms. Millions of people living in low-lying coastal zones and critical infrastructure within this zone rely on accurate storm surge forecast for disaster prevention and flood hazard mitigation. However, variability in residual sea level up-estuary, defined here as observed sea level minus predicted tide, can enhance total water levels; variability in the surge thus needs to be captured accurately to reduce uncertainty in site specific hazard assessment. Delft3D-FLOW is used to investigate surge variability, and the influence of storm surge timing on barotropic tide-surge propagation in a tide-dominant estuary using the Severn Estuary, south-west England, as an example. Model results show maximum surge elevation increases exponentially up-estuary and, for a range of surge timings consistently occurs on the flood tide. In the Severn Estuary, over a distance of 40 km from the most upstream tide gauge at Oldbury, the maximum surge elevation increases by 255%. Up-estuary locations experience short duration, high magnitude surge elevations and greater variability due to shallow-water effects and channel convergence. The results show that surge predictions from forecasting systems at tide gauge locations could under-predict the magnitude and duration of surge contribution to up-estuary water levels. Due to the large tidal range and dynamic nature of hyper-tidal estuaries, local forecasting systems should consider changes in surge elevation and shape with distance up-estuary from nearby tide gauge sites to minimize uncertainties in flood hazard assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2898185816,"Background Although it is a preventable and treatable disease, tuberculosis remains a major medical and public health problem throughout the world. The control and elimination of tuberculosis is currently challenged by the development and spread of antituberculosis drug resistance. The resistance is often correlated to the absence of properly implemented control measures that lead to poor treatment outcomes. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to assess poor treatment outcomes and its determinants among tuberculosis patients in selected health facilities in East Wollega zone, Western Ethiopia. Method A five-year retrospective cross-sectional study design was employed. Data were collected from patients’ medical record from January to March 2017. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Descriptive statistics were used to generate and summarize frequencies. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to associate the potential determinants of poor treatment outcomes. Results From 995 patients with documented treatment outcomes, 58.9% were males with a mean age of 31.9±16.3 years and 58% lived in rural areas. Majorities of cases (95.7%) were newly treated ones. Nearly half of the cases had extrapulmonary tuberculosis and 6.8% were co-infected with HIV. Nearly three-quarter of patients had completed their treatment while 17.2%, 2.9%, 4.8%, 0.4% patients were cured, defaulted, died, and failed, respectively. The overall treatment success rate was 91.9%. Being treated in Anger Gute health center (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.27; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18–4.38); male (AOR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.06–3.10); lived in rural areas (AOR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.02–2.91); previously treated (AOR: 2.72; 95% CI: 1.16–6.39) and unknown HIV status (AOR: 4.56; 95% CI: 1.98–10.50) were determinants of poor treatment outcomes. Conclusion The current treatment success rate was exceeded the recommended target. However, special attention and strict follow up is required for tuberculosis patients with high risk of unsuccessful treatment outcomes including male, rural resident, previously treated and unknown in HIV status patients throughout their treatment periods."
https://openalex.org/W2898300767,"To develop a patient derived xenograft (PDX) model of cervical cancer and cervical dysplasia using the subrenal capsule.Cervical cancer (12 Squamous Cell Carcinoma, 1 Adenocarcinoma, 1 Adenosquamous Carcinoma), 7 cervical dysplasia biopsy and normal cervical tissues were transplanted beneath the renal capsule of immunocompromised NOD/SCID/gamma mice. Resulting tumours were harvested and portions serially transplanted into new recipient mice for up to three in vivo passages. Parent and xenograft tumours were examined by immunohistochemistry for p16INK41, HPV, and CD-45. Single cell suspensions of mixed mouse and human, or human only cell populations were also transplanted.The overall engraftment rate for the primary cervical cancer PDX model was 71.4 ±12.5% (n = 14). Tumours maintained morphological, histoarchitecture and immunohistochemical features of the parent tumour, and demonstrated invasiveness into local tissues. Single cell suspensions did not produce tumour growth in this model. Mean length of time (32.4 +/- 3.5 weeks) for the transplanted tissue to generate a tumour in the animal was similar between successive transplantations. Three of four xenografted cervical dysplasia tissues generated microscopic cystic structures resembling dysplastic cervical tissue. Normal cervical tissue (4 of 5 xenografted) also developed microscopic cervical tissue grafts.The subrenal capsule can be used for a PDX model of human cervical cancer with a good engraftment rate and the ability to model in vivo characteristics of cervical cancer. For the first time we have demonstrated that cervical dysplasia and normal cervical tissue generated microscopic tissues in a PDX model."
https://openalex.org/W2898448734,"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) modulates mechanosensitive vagal afferent nerves in the gastrointestinal tract. ATP is stored in secretory vesicles via the ATP transporter VNUT. Recently, the bisphosphate clodronate was reported to inhibit VNUT and was suggested to be a safe potent therapeutic option for chronic pain. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is activated by mechanical stimuli and some epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and becomes sensitized under inflammatory conditions. We have previously reported that TRPV4 and VNUT are expressed in mouse esophageal keratinocytes and that TRPV4 activation induces ATP release in gastric epithelial cells. Here we show the expression of TRPV4 and VNUT in normal human gastrointestinal cell derived cell lines (GES-1 and CCD 841) and in tissues from normal and VNUT-KO mice. TRPV4 agonists (GSK101 or 8,9-EET) induced an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ and/or current responses in mouse primary colonic epithelial cells and CCD 841 cells, but not in cells isolated from TRPV4-KO mice. TRPV4 agonists (GSK101 or 5.6-EET) also induced ATP release in GES-1 and CCD 841 cells, which could be blocked by the VNUT inhibitor, clodronate. Thus, VNUT inhibition with clodronate could represent a novel therapeutic option for visceral pain."
https://openalex.org/W2898585041,"HIV and AIDS care requires frequent visits to the hospital. Patient satisfaction with care services during hospital visits is important in considering quality and outcome of care. Increasing number of patients needing treatment led to the decentralization of care to lower level hospitals without documented patient perception on the quality of services. The study determined and compared patient satisfaction with HIV and AIDS care services in public and private hospitals and identified the factors that influence it.This was a cross-sectional comparative study of patients receiving antiretroviral treatment in public and private hospitals in Anambra State. The sampling frame for the hospitals consisted of all registered public and private hospitals that have rendered antiretroviral services for at least one year. There were three public urban, nine public rural, eleven private urban and ten private rural hospitals that met the criteria. One hospital was selected by simple random sampling (balloting) from each group. Out of a total of 6334 eligible patients (had received ART for at least 12 months), 1270 were recruited by simple random sampling from the hospitals proportionate to size of patient in each hospital. Adapted, validated and pretested Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ18) was interviewer-administered on consenting patients as an exit interview. A Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were conducted at 5% level of significance.There were 635 participants each in public and private hospitals. Of the 408 patients who had primary education or less, 265(65.0%) accessed care in public hospitals compared to 143(35.0%) who accessed care in private hospital (p<0.001). Similarly, of the 851 patients who were currently married, 371 (43.6%) accessed their care in public compared to 480 (56.4%) who accessed care in private (p<0.001). The proportion of participants who were satisfied were more in public hospitals (71.5%) compared to private hospitals (41.4%). The difference in proportion was statistically significant (χ2 = 116.85, p <0.001). Good retention in care [AOR: 2.3, 95%CI: 1.5-3.5] was the only predictor of satisfaction in public hospitals while primary education [adjusted odds ratio (AOR); 2.3, 95%CI: 1.5-3.4], residing in rural area [AOR: 2.0, 95%CI: 1.4-2.9], and once-daily dosing [AOR: 3.2, 95%CI: 2.1-4.8] were independent predictors of patient' satisfaction among private hospital respondents.Satisfaction was higher among patients attending public hospitals. Patient's satisfaction was strongly associated with retention in care among patients in public hospitals. However, in private hospitals, it was influenced by the patient's level of education, place of residence, and antiretroviral medication dosing frequency."
https://openalex.org/W2790076230,"A systematic understanding of the evolution and growth dynamics of invasive solid tumors in response to different chemotherapy strategies is crucial for the development of individually optimized oncotherapy. Here, we develop a hybrid three-dimensional (3D) computational model that integrates pharmacokinetic model, continuum diffusion-reaction model and discrete cell automaton model to investigate 3D invasive solid tumor growth in heterogeneous microenvironment under chemotherapy. Specifically, we consider the effects of heterogeneous environment on drug diffusion, tumor growth, invasion and the drug-tumor interaction on individual cell level. We employ the hybrid model to investigate the evolution and growth dynamics of avascular invasive solid tumors under different chemotherapy strategies. Our simulations indicate that constant dosing is generally more effective in suppressing primary tumor growth than periodic dosing, due to the resulting continuous high drug concentration. In highly heterogeneous microenvironment, the malignancy of the tumor is significantly enhanced, leading to inefficiency of chemotherapies. The effects of geometrically-confined microenvironment and non-uniform drug dosing are also investigated. Our computational model, when supplemented with sufficient clinical data, could eventually lead to the development of efficient in silico tools for prognosis and treatment strategy optimization."
https://openalex.org/W2898308612,"The positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [18F]MNI-659, selective for phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A), is a promising tool to assess an early biomarker for Huntington's disease (HD). In this study we investigated [18F]MNI-659 uptake in the Q175 mouse model of HD. Given the focal striatal distribution of PDE10A as well as the striatal atrophy occurring in HD, the spatial normalization approach applied during the processing could sensibly affect the accuracy of the regional quantification. We compared the use of a magnetic resonance images (MRI) template based on individual MRI over a PET and CT templates for regional quantification and spatial normalization of [18F]MNI-659 PET images. We performed [18F]MNI-659 PET imaging in six months old heterozygous (HET) Q175 mice and wild-type (WT) littermates, followed by X-ray computed tomography (CT) scan. In the same week, individual T2-weighted MRI were acquired. Spatial normalization and regional quantification of the PET/CT images was performed on MRI, [18F]MNI-659 PET, or CT template and compared to binding potential (BPND) using volumes manually delineated on the individual MR images. Striatal volume was significantly reduced in HET mice (-7.7%, p<0.0001) compared to WT littermates. [18F]MNI-659 BPND in striatum of HET animals was significantly reduced (p<0.0001) when compared to WT littermates using all three templates. However, BPND values were significantly higher for HET mice using the PET template compared to the MRI and CT ones (p<0.0001), with an overestimation at lower activities. On the other hand, the CT template spatial normalization introduced larger variability reducing the effect size. The PET and CT template-based approaches resulted in a lower accuracy in BPND quantification with consequent decrease in the detectability of disease effect. This study demonstrates that for [18F]MNI-659 brain PET imaging in mice the use of an MRI-based spatial normalization is recommended to achieve accurate quantification and fully exploit the detectability of disease effect."
https://openalex.org/W2898518933,"Intramuscular (IM) vaccination with formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (FI-RSV) failed in clinical trials due to vaccine-enhanced respiratory disease. To test the efficacy of skin vaccination against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), we investigated the immunogenicity, efficacy, and inflammatory disease after microneedle (MN) patch delivery of FI-RSV vaccine (FI-RSV MN) to the mouse skin with or without an adjuvant of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL). Compared to IM vaccination, MN patch delivery of FI-RSV was more effective in clearing lung viral loads and preventing weight loss, and in diminishing inflammation, infiltrating immune cells, and T helper type 2 (Th2) CD4 T cell responses after RSV challenge. With MPL adjuvant, MN patch delivery of FI-RSV significantly increased the immunogenicity and efficacy as well as preventing RSV disease as evidenced by lung viral clearance and avoiding pulmonary histopathology. Improved efficacy and prevention of disease by FI-RSV MN with MPL were correlated with no sign of airway resistance, lower levels of Th2 cytokines and infiltrating innate inflammatory cells, and higher levels of Th1 T cell responses into the lung. This study suggests that MN patch delivery of RSV vaccines to the skin with MPL adjuvant would be a promising vaccination method."

Design Retrospective case-series in five maternity units in a perinatal network. Setting All women who underwent IUBT for persistent PPH after vaginal delivery from January 2011 to December 2015 in these hospitals. Methods All maternity apply the same management policy for PPH. IUBT, using a Bakri balloon, was used as a second line therapy for persistent PPH after failure of bimanual uterine massage and uterotonics to stop bleeding after vaginal delivery. Women who required another second line therapy (embolization or surgical procedures) to stop bleeding after IUBT were defined as cases, and women whom IUBT stopped bleeding were defined as control group. We determined independent predictors for failed IUBT using multiple regression and adjusting for demographics with adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results During the study period, there were 91,880 deliveries in the five hospitals and IUBT was used in 108 women to control bleeding. The success rate was 74.1% (80/108). In 28 women, invasive procedures were required (19 embolization and 9 surgical procedures with 5 peripartum hysterectomies). Women with failed IUBT were more often obese (25.9% vs. 8.1%; p = 0.03), duration of labor was shorter (363.9 min vs. 549.7min; p = 0.04), and major PPH (≥1,500 mL) before IUBT was more frequent (64% vs. 40%; p = 0.04). Obesity was a predictive factor of failed IUBT (aOR 4.40, 95% CI 1.06–18.31). Major PPH before IUBT seemed to be another predictor of failure (aOR 1.001, 95% CI 1.000–1.002), but our result did not reach statistical significativity. Conclusion Intrauterine balloon tamponade is an effective second line therapy for persistent primary PPH after vaginal delivery. Pre-pregnancy obesity is a risk factor of IUBT failure."
https://openalex.org/W2898332467,"Bletilla striata is an endangered orchid that has been used for millennia as a medicinal herb, in cosmetics and as a horticultural plant. To construct the first nucleotide database for this species and to develop abundant EST-SSR markers for facilitating further studies, various tissues and organs of plants in the main developmental stages were harvested for mRNA isolation and subsequent RNA sequencing. A total of 106,054,784 clean reads were generated by using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. The reads were assembled into 127,261 unigenes by the Trinity package; the unigenes had an average length of 612 bp and an N50 of 957 bp. Of these unigenes, 67,494 (51.86%) were annotated in a series of databases. Of these annotated unigenes, 41,818 and 24,615 were assigned to gene ontology categories and clusters of orthologous groups, respectively. Additionally, 20,764 (15.96%) unigenes were mapped onto 275 pathways using the KEGG database. In addition, 25,935 high-quality EST-SSR primer pairs were developed from the 15,433 unigenes by MISA mining. To validate the accuracy of the newly designed markers, 87 of 100 randomly selected primers were effectively amplified; 63 of those yielded PCR products of the expected size, and 25 yielded products with significant amounts of polymorphism among the 4 landraces. Furthermore, the transferability test of the 25 polymorphic markers was performed in 6 individuals of two closely related genus Phalaenopsis and dendrobium. Which results showed a total of 5 markers can successfully amplified among these populations. This research provides a comprehensive nucleotide database and lays a solid foundation for functional gene mining and genomic research in B. striata. The developed EST-SSR primers could facilitate phylogenetic studies and breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2898537013,"Morphometric differences were investigated among five fish species of subfamily Barbinae from the Ganga river system through traditional morphometrics and the truss network system. Species taken into account were Puntius chola (Hamilton 1822), Puntius sophore (Hamilton 1822), Pethia ticto (Hamilton 1822), Pethia conchonius (Hamilton 1822) and Systomus sarana (Hamilton 1822). Although, taxonomists carefully examine external body features to discriminate these species, there is still a risk of misidentification during a visual assessment. In the present study, the traditional morphological analysis included 22 morphometric measurements and 10 meristic counts. Truss network system of 14 landmarks was interconnected to yield 91 distance variables. The principal component analysis (PCA), discriminant function analysis (DFA) and cluster analysis (CA) were employed in order to determine morphometric variations. In traditional analysis, 29 characters out of 32 were found significant (p<0.05). Eight principal components were extracted through PCA explaining 85.30% of the total variance in samples, DFA correctly classified 100.0% of original grouped cases and 100.0% of cross-validated grouped cases. Truss analysis showed that all the 90 characters were significant (p<0.05). PCA extracted four principal components explaining 96.45% of the total variance. DFA correctly classified 96.1% of original grouped cases and 92.1% of cross-validated grouped cases. The results acquired from the traditional as well as truss analyses indicate significant morphometric heterogeneity. However, variations are not the same for the two different methods (traditional and truss) employed for the analyses. Shape differences among species were evident from relative warps (RW) supporting truss network analysis. Geometric morphometric methods (GMM), but limited use of Procrustes methods revealed even very small dissimilarity between groups. In spite of determining the morphometric differentiation among species, the present study also provides a useful insight on the application and complementary role of truss analysis with traditional morphometric analysis in the correct classification of the selected species."
https://openalex.org/W2952429882,"This study aimed to determine the impact of stocking density on the liver proteome and cecal microbiota of Peking ducks. A total of 1,200 21-day-old ducks were randomly assigned to 5 stocking density groups of 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 ducks/m2, with 6 replicates for each group. At 40 days of age, duck serum and pectorals were collected for biochemical tests; liver and cecal contents of ducks were gathered for proteome and microbiota analysis, respectively. Serum MDA increased while pectorals T-AOC reduced linearly with enhancing stocking density. Duck lipid metabolism was altered under different stocking density as well. Serum LDL-C increased linearly with increasing stocking density. Proteome analysis revealed fatty acid biosynthesis proteins such as acyl-CoA synthetase family member 2 and fatty acid oxidation related proteins including acyl-CoA dehydrogenase long chain and acyl-coenzyme A oxidase were enriched in high stocking density group. Additionally, high stocking density increased oxidative response associated proteins such as DDRGK domain containing 1. Furthermore, increasing stocking density diminished proteins of anti-oxidant capacity including regucalcin and catalase. 16S rDNA analysis revealed that higher stocking density was accompanied with decreased microbial diversity, as well as depletion of anti-inflammatory bacterial taxa, including Bacteroidales, Butyricimonas and Alistipe. Besides, reduced bile acid metabolism-associated bacteria such as Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiales and Desulfovibrionaceae were found in the high-density group. Both proteome and 16S rDNA results showed inflammation and chronic liver disease trend in the high-density group, which suggests the involvement of the liver-gut axis in oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2898148278,"Objective 
Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common surgical emergency in preterm infants, and pathogenesis associates with changes in the fecal microbiome. As fecal samples incompletely represent microbial communities in intestinal mucosa, we sought to determine the NEC tissue-specific microbiome and assess its contribution to pathogenesis.


Design 
We amplified and sequenced the V1-V3 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene extracted from intestinal tissue and corresponding fecal samples from 12 surgical patients with NEC and 14 surgical patients without NEC. Low quality and non-bacterial sequences were removed, and taxonomic assignment was made with the Ribosomal Database Project. Operational taxonomic units were clustered at 97%. We tested for differences between NEC and non-NEC samples in microbiome alpha- and beta-diversity and differential abundance of specific taxa between NEC and non-NEC samples. Additional analyses were performed to assess the contribution of other demographic and environmental confounding factors on the infant tissue and fecal microbiome.


Results 
The fecal and tissue microbial communities were different. NEC was associated with a distinct microbiome, which was characterized by low diversity, higher abundances of Staphylococcus and Clostridium_sensu_stricto, and lower abundances of Actinomyces and Corynebacterium. Infant age and vancomycin exposure correlated with shifts in the tissue microbiome.


Conclusion 
The observed low diversity in NEC tissues suggests that NEC is associated with a bacterial bloom and a distinct mucosal bacterial community. The exact bacterial species that constitute the bloom varied by infant and were strongly influenced by age and exposure to vancomycin."
https://openalex.org/W2898405152,"Media sclerosis (MS) and peripheral artery disease (PAD) may coincide, particularly in type 2 diabetics (T2D) and in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In contrast to non-diabetics, in T2D PAD is more severe and more distal. Although MS is suspected to play a role, the underlying pathophysiological reasons for the differences still remain elusive today. We tested the hypothesis that MS is a promoter of atherosclerosis as it occurs in T2D with PAD by interfering with arterial remodeling using an in-silico simulation. We confirmed that MS aggravates PAD by promoting negative remodeling. We found that the effect is more pronounced in smaller distal arteries compared to larger proximal ones. Our results suggest that the degree of this divergence depends on the ratio between the thickness of the intima relative to the thickness of the media/adventitia of the individually affected arteries."
https://openalex.org/W2898504643,"Background Guidelines recommend a break-in period of 2 weeks before starting peritoneal dialysis (PD), but PD within 14 days is also an acceptable and safe alternative to hemodialysis (HD) in patients with an urgent need. However, the effect of the break-in period within 48 hours or later had not been evaluated for early technical complications, long-term maintenance, and survival in patients starting urgent PD. Methods Of 360 patients with a surgically inserted PD catheter, we evaluated 190 patients who needed urgent PD and 29 patients who received conventional PD at a single center between January 2007 and December 2014 in this retrospective observational study. Enrolled patients were divided according to break-in period of <48 hours (P1) or 2–13 days (P2) before starting urgent PD. The primary endpoint was incidence of early technical complications and secondary endpoints included long-term PD maintenance, and patient survival. Results PD was started in 103 patients (54.2%) within 48 hours and in 87 patients (45.8%) within 2 to 13 days. The incidence of early technical complication was significantly higher in P1 group (28.2%) than in P2 group (10.3%) (P = 0.002). The need for a repositioning procedure was significantly greater in P1 group (14.6%) than in P2 group (3.4%) (P = 0.009). However, we observed no significant differences between the two groups with respect to the prevalence of catheter dysfunction requiring change to HD within 6 months or incidence of peritonitis or exit-site infection. There was no significant difference in PD maintenance and patient survival according to the break-in period between P1 and P2 as well as against the control group. Conclusion Urgent PD was associated with a low incidence of early technical complications if start was avoided within 48 hours after catheter insertion, and long-term PD maintenance was independent of the break-in period."
https://openalex.org/W2898315137,"Mutations in interleukin-10 receptor (IL-10R) genes are one cause of very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease with perianal lesions, which can be cured by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Using a functional test, which assesses responsiveness of peripheral monocytes to IL-10, we identified three unrelated Portuguese patients carrying two novel IL-10RB mutations. In the three patients, sequencing of genomic DNA identified the same large deletion of exon 3 which precluded protein expression. This mutation was homozygous in two patients born from consanguineous families and heterozygous in the third patient born from unrelated parents. Microsatellite analysis of the IL10RB genomic region revealed a common haplotype in the three Portuguese families pointing to a founder deletion inherited from a common ancestor 400 years ago. In the third patient, surface expression of IL-10R was normal but signaling in response to IL-10 was impaired. Complementary DNA sequencing and next-generation sequencing of IL10RB locus with custom-made probes revealed a ≈ 6 Kb duplication encompassing the exon 6 which leads to a frameshift mutation and a loss of the TYK2-interacting Box 2 motif. Altogether, we describe two novel copy number variations in IL10RB, one with founder effect and one preserving cell surface expression but abolishing signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2898510249,"The German yellowjacket (Vespula germanica) is an opportunist predator and a scavenger, whose eclectic diet also includes honey, brood, dead and live honey-bees. There is no evidence in this species of coordinated attacks against bees involving other conspecifics, although intraspecific competition has been already reported between two or more individuals during feeding. Our aim was to gain further knowledge on the feeding behavior of V. germanica in order to evaluate its role in an apiary. Sight observations of predation and necrophagy behaviors were carried out at the ground level near hives. We also investigated how intraspecific competition can influence the feeding display in this species. Our results confirm the major role of the German yellowjacket as a scavenger, because its diet is based mostly on bee carrions. Intraspecific competition during feeding was sometimes observed. When these events occurred, the interference of another wasp led to the bee escaping only in three cases. Our study also revealed that intraspecific competition events increase when the resource is fresh (predation vs necrophagy), and that the number of competing wasps was significantly higher when the food consisted of pupae and drones, compared to adult bees. When competition involved two individuals (the most frequent case), the winner was frequently the first wasp to reach the resource in both predation and necrophagy events. This suggests that the energy invested in foraging or predating activity and in defence of prey is usually rewarded."
https://openalex.org/W2898580098,"The modern cattle was domesticated from aurochs, sharing its physiological traits into two subspecies Bos taurus and Bos indicus. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding short RNAs of ~22nt which have a key role in the regulation of many cellular and physiological processes in the animal. The current study was aimed to predict and annotate the potential mutations in indicine miRNAs throughout the genome using de novo and homology-based in silico approaches. Genome-wide mapping was performed in available indicine assembly by the homology-based approach and 768 miRNAs were recovered out of 808 reported taurine miRNAs belonging to 521 unique mature miRNA families. While 42 precursors were dropped due to lack of secondary miRNA structure, increasing stringency or decreasing similarity between the two genomes' miRNA. Increasing tendency of miRNAs incidence was observed on chr5, chr7, chr8, chr12 and chr21 with 19 polycistronic miRNA within 1-kilobase distance throughout the indicine genome. Notably, 12 miRNAs showed copy number variation. Eighteen miRNAs showed a mutation in their mature sequences in which eight were found in their seed region. Whilst in de novo based approach, 12 novel potential miRNAs on Y chromosome in indicine cattle along with a new miRNA (bind-miR-1264) on chrX were found. The final data set is annotated and explains the impending target genes that are responsible for enhanced immunity, heat tolerance and disease tolerance regulation in indicine. The study conforms to better understanding and perceptive approach towards indicine genome."
https://openalex.org/W2898152406,"Objective To identify changes in work-related psychological attitudes that influence mental health improvement in school teachers after participation in a psychological group program. Methods In an exploratory study with N = 544 matched cases we combined a screening instrument for general mental health (GHQ) with measures of work-related behavioral and experiential patterns (AVEM). We compared four GHQ change types pre and post intervention with regard to their performance on eleven sub-scales that figure as professional resources. Factors that showed significant relative changes and thus (likely) contributed to improved health status were identified by means of pairwise t-tests and corresponding effect sizes. Results Decreases in willingness to work to exhaustion (VB), in striving for perfection (PS), and in the tendency for resignation in the face of failure (RT), as well as an increase of distancing ability (DF) and of inner calm and balance (IR) appear to be the main factors influencing health improvement in the intervention. Simultaneously, an increase of satisfaction with life (LZ) is observed. Conclusions The balanced use of professional resources is a critical ingredient in maintaining teachers' health. Adjusting the balance between commitment and resistance through factors found in this analysis help teachers in maintaining and strengthening resilience. The coaching program addresses these factors by focusing on personal attitudes and good interpersonal relationships in the school environment."
https://openalex.org/W2898341492,"Yes-associated protein (YAP) acts as a mechanotransducer in determining the cell fate of murine C2C12 mesenchymal precursors as investigated after stimulation with ultrasound. We applied Focused Low-Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound (FLIPUS) at a sound frequency of 3.6 MHz, 100 Hz pulse repetition frequency (PRF), 27.8% duty cycle (DC), and 44.5 mW/cm2 acoustic intensity ISATA for 5 minutes and evaluated early cellular responses. FLIPUS decreased the level of phosphorylated YAP on Serine 127, leading to higher levels of active YAP in the nucleus. This in turn enhanced the expression of YAP-target genes associated with actin nucleation and stabilization, cytokinesis, and cell cycle progression. FLIPUS enhanced proliferation of C2C12 cells, whereas silencing of YAP expression abolished the beneficial effects of ultrasound. The expression of the transcription factor MyoD, defining cellular myogenic differentiation, was inhibited by mechanical stimulation. This study shows that ultrasound exposure regulates YAP functioning, which in turn improves the cell proliferative potential, critical for tissue regeneration process."
https://openalex.org/W2898215374,"Detailed assessment of hydrochar wetting properties, which could provide an essential understanding of underlying mechanisms during its application to soils, is lacking. We characterized hydrochar produced from hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) performed on poultry litter at various temperatures and for different times in terms of hydrophobicity and surface free energy properties. Hydrochar was more hydrophobic than untreated poultry litter, and its hydrophobicity increased with increasing HTC temperature (contact angle > 130°). These changes were correlated with degradation of hemicellulose and cellulose. Hydrochar produced at 250°C contained mostly lignin and displayed high hydrophobicity over both prolonged wetting periods and repeated wetting cycles. Surface free energy was calculated using the Owens–Wendt–Rabel–Kaelble and Wu models, with the latter resulting in lower standard errors. The surface free energy decreased as HTC treatment severity increased from 26 mJ/m2 in the poultry litter to 8 mJ/m2 after treatment at 250°C for 60 min. The dispersive component fraction of the surface free energy increased with increasing treatment severity. This study demonstrated that changes in the physical composition of hydrochar due to increased treatment severity increase its hydrophobicity and decrease its surface free energy. Moreover, due to non-persistent hydrophobicity, hydrochar produced at temperatures lower than 250°C will likely not show adverse effects on soils."

Changes in the QTc (corrected QT) interval before and after liver transplantation (LT) for the treatment of liver cirrhosis (LC) and its association with clinical outcomes have not been fully evaluated.From January 2011 to May 2016, consecutive 516 consecutive recipients were enrolled into LT registry and the median follow-up was 31 months (IQR 12-52). Patients with an available electrocardiogram before LT and 1 month after from LT were analyzed. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to prolonged QTc interval. The patient groups were analyzed separately according whether the electrocardiogram was preoperative or postoperative. The primary outcome was all-cause death during the follow-up period.A total of 283 patients were enrolled in the study. In the preoperative QTc prolongation group, there was not a significant rate difference in all-cause mortality in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53-1.66; P = 0.26). However, in the postoperative QTc prolongation group, mortality was significantly increased (HR, 1.78; 95%CI, 1.05-3.03; P = 0.03) in patients who underwent LT.In patients who underwent LT for LC, postoperative QTc prolongation on ECG, rather than preoperative, is associated with mortality.

https://openalex.org/W2898488366,"When patients have strong initial attitudes about a medical intervention, they might not be open to learning new information when choosing whether or not to receive the intervention. We aim to show that non-fit messaging (messages framed in a manner that is incongruent with recipients' motivational orientation) can increase attention to the message content, thereby de-intensifying an initial attitude bias and reducing the influence of this bias on choice. In this study, 196 students received information about the pros and cons of a vaccine, framed in either a fit or non-fit manner with their motivational orientation. The results show that when information was presented in a non-fit (vs. fit) manner, the strength of participants' initial attitude was reduced. An eye-tracking procedure indicated that participants read information more thoroughly (measured by the average length of fixation time while reading) in the non-fit condition versus fit condition. This average time of fixation mediated the effect of message framing on the strength of people's attitudes. A reduction in attitude was associated with participants' ability to recall the given information correctly and make a choice consistent with the provided information. Non-fit messaging increases individuals' willingness to process information when individuals' pre-existing attitude biases might otherwise cause them to make uninformed decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2898511294,"Conditions experienced during early-life can cause the onset of oxidative stress, resulting in pervasive effects on diverse life-history traits, including lifespan. In birds, maternally-transferred egg substances may exert positive or negative influence over the offspring phenotype. Among these, testosterone can upregulate the bioavailability of certain antioxidants but simultaneously promotes the production of pro-oxidants, leading to an oxidative stress situation, which is one of the main forces causing telomere attrition However, no study has investigated the role of this androgen on telomere dynamics in birds and little is known about the effects of yolk testosterone on oxidative status in early-life of these species. We physiologically increased the levels of yolk testosterone by in ovo injections in yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) to evaluate the effects induced by this androgen on hatchlings plasma total antioxidant capacity, amount of pro-oxidant molecules and telomere length at hatching. Testosterone supplementation did not increase hatchling body growth, did not result in the overproduction of pro-oxidant molecules nor a reduction of antioxidant capacity. Accordingly, telomere length at hatching was not affected by testosterone treatment, although hatchlings from the third-laid eggs showed shorter telomeres than their siblings from first- and second-laid eggs, independently of testosterone treatment. Our results suggest that injection of physiological levels of testosterone does not induce oxidative stress to hatchlings and, consequently do not affect telomere dynamics during early post-natal periods."

Some pet food companies have adopted whole sorghum in their formulations, however sorghum flour and (or) its phenolic rich seed coat might provide added benefit to companion animal diets. The objective of this experiment was to evaluate diets utilizing sorghum flour (FLD), and sorghum mill feed (MFD) relative to whole sorghum (WSD), and conventional grains (rice, corn and wheat; CON) in a typical dog diet. Adult (1-3 yr) Beagle dogs (n = 12; 10.6 kg ± 1.4) were randomly assigned to individual pens with ad libitum access to water. Dogs were fed twice daily and adapted to diet (9 d), and then total feces were collected for 5 d over 4 periods in a 4x4 replicated Latin square design. Fecal output for determination of digestibility was estimated using Cr2O3 as a marker. Number of defecations were quantified, and feces were scored. Approximately 3 mL of blood from each dog was collected at the end of each period and stored at -80° until further analyses. Means were separated using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Intake did not differ among treatments (average 187 g/d), but dogs fed the MFD excreted a larger (P<0.05) amount of feces, had more defecations per day, and lower (P<0.05) overall nutrient digestibility compared to the other treatments. The FLD had the highest (P<0.05) dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP) and gross energy (GE) digestibility, suggesting a possible application in ""easy-to-digest"" pet foods. Dogs fed the MFD had the highest (P < 0.05) plasma oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) value, but plasma ferulic and p-coumaric acids did not differ among treatments. Sorghum fractions have potential application in pet food; wherein, a bran rich fraction may promote antioxidant capacity, and flour increased digestibility."

The objective of this study was to evaluate and characterize changes in muscle tissue characteristics of hind limbs in young, dystrophic mice using MRI. Mdx4cv (n = 25) and age-matched C57BL/6J (n = 5) were imaged at 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 weeks of age. Multiple MR measurements were taken from the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles. There were significant differences between dystrophic and control groups for all three muscle types when comparing transverse relaxation times (T2) in lower hind limb muscles. Additionally, fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity, and eigenvalue analysis of diffusion tensor imaging also demonstrated significant differences between groups. Longitudinal relaxation times (T1) displayed no significant differences between groups. The earliest time points in the magnetization transfer ratio measurements displayed a significant difference. Histological analysis revealed significant differences in the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles between groups with the mdx mice displaying greater variability in muscle fiber size in later time points. The multi-parametric MRI approach offers a promising alternative for future development of a noninvasive avenue for tracking both disease progression and treatment response."
https://openalex.org/W2898542025,"Cold atmospheric-pressure plasma (CAP) is a relatively new method used for bacterial inactivation. CAP is ionized gas that can be generated by applying an electric current to air or a feeding gas. It contains reactive species and emits UV radiation, which have antibacterial activity. Previous data suggests that CAP is effective in microbial inactivation and can decontaminate and sterilize surfaces, but its exact mode of action is still under debate. This study demonstrates the effect of CAP on the whole proteome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms, which is a dominant pathogen in cystic fibrosis and medical device-related infections. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to identify differentially regulated proteins of whole cell P. aeruginosa extracts. A total of 16 proteins were identified to be affected by plasma treatment compared to the control. Eight of the identified proteins have functions in transcription and translation and their expression changes are likely to be part of a general physiological response instead of a CAP-specific adaptation. However, CAP also affected bacterioferritin (Bfr), Isocitrate dehydrogenase (Idh), Trigger factor (Tig) and a chemotaxis protein, which may be involved in P. aeruginosa's specific response to CAP. We confirm that bacterioferritin B plays a role in the bacterial response to CAP because ΔbfrB mutants of both PAO1 and PA14 are more susceptible to plasma-induced cell-death than their corresponding wild-type strains. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing the effect of plasma on the whole proteome of a pathogenic microorganism. It will help our understanding of the mode of action of CAP-mediated bacterial inactivation and thus support a safe and effective routine use of CAP in clinical and industrial settings."
https://openalex.org/W2898096404,"This study aimed to evaluate 1) the influence of gibberellic acid (GA3) in the development of Tifton 85 bermudagrass grown in constructed wetland systems (CWs) and 2) the plant's capacity to remove nutrients and sodium from synthetic municipal wastewater (SMW). The experiment was carried out in Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil, and consisted of foliar applications of GA3 set in randomized blocks design, with four replicates and 6 treatments as following: NC (control with plants); 0 μM GA3; N1: 5 μM GA3; N2: 25 μM GA3; N3: 50 and N4: 100 μM GA3 per CWs, NC* (control with no plants): 0 μM GA3. The study was conducted over two crop cycles in the spring 2016. The parameters used to evaluate the performance of the Tifton 85 bermudagrass were its plant height, productivity, chlorophyll measurement, number of internodes, nutrients and Na removals. Chemical analyses of the effluents were conducted. In response to the application of GA3, the increase in height of Tifton 85 bermudagrass in the first crop cycle was higher than the increase in height in the second crop cycle. The decrease in plant growth in response to GA3 in the second crop cycle may be linked to the age of the plant tissue and climatic conditions. The greater growth of the plants cultivated in the CWs allows a more efficient removal of pollutants, using simple management and low cost. The results suggest that applying 50 μM of GA3 to the development of Tifton 85 bermudagrass provides higher dry matter yield and removal of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sodium for the first crop cycle in CWs. However, in the second crop cycle, the application of GA3 had no effect on dry matter production and nutrient removal by Tifton 85 bermudagrass in CWs."
https://openalex.org/W2898288139,"Background Certified nursing assistants (CNAs) in palliative care units often encounter the death of patients and undergo emotional burdens because of their altruistic practices. However, the influences of altruism and perceptions of death on the work morale of CNAs remain unclear. The fact that morale can be improved by modifying related factors justifies the necessity of a theoretical model of morale for CNAs. However, such a model is currently absent. Based on relevant literature, factors including altruism, social support, perceptions of death, and job satisfaction are related to morale through the mediation of job stress. Aim This study was aimed toward determining the influencing factors and developing a structural model of morale with regard to CNAs working in palliative care units. Design The hypothesized model was tested in a cross-sectional design with structural equation modeling using AMOS 23. Setting/Participants A total of 413 CNAs from five hospice units in Taiwan participated in the survey. Results Goodness-of-fit indexes, including χ2/DF = 2.187, PGFI = 0.461, and PNFI = 0.462, among others, confirmed the modified model fit the data well. Altruism, social support, perceptions of death, and job satisfaction were negatively related to job stress (-0.238, -0.196, -0.204, and -0.131, respectively). Altruism and social support positively affected job satisfaction (0.635 and 0.553). Factors directly affecting morale included altruism, social support, job stress, and job satisfaction (0.837, 0.711, -0.244, and 0.540, respectively). The relationship between altruism and morale was the strongest among all the direct paths toward morale. Job stress was the major mediator in these relationships. Conclusion Altruism is imperative for morale. The confirmed model is called the Five Constructs to Morale (5CM) model. These findings indicate the need to assess the levels of altruism and perceptions of death during the recruitment of CNAs. From the perspective of human resource management and organizational behavior, CNAs with a high level of altruism and a positive attitude toward death assure the well-being of end of life patients because of work involvement and commitment to the challenging work of hospice care. The cultivation of a supportive environment and coping strategies are suggested for the management of CNAs facing patient death. Hospice care decision makers should carefully assess morale levels among health professionals by applying the 5CM model. Identifying modifiable factors that can improve morale among nursing staff in hospice care to ensure work fulfillment and quality care merits emphasis in clinical practice. The establishment of effective strategies to facilitate the work morale of nursing staff is suggested for palliative care units. Morale improvement related task should be a global public health priority."

Many other studies found specific associations of oxytocin, arginine-vasopressin, serotonin and dopamine receptor gene polymorphisms with various aspects of trait empathy. As all these receptors belong to the guanine-binding protein (G protein) coupled receptor family, it is a reasonable assumption, that alterations in genes encoding G protein subunits also influence the signal transduction in empathy related circuits. However, to the best of our knowledge, these genomic variations have not yet been studied in genetic research on empathy. Methods Here, we analysed associations of a common polymorphism of the GNAS gene (C393T) in a previously characterized sample of 421 healthy blood donors (231 M, 190 F; age 18–74). The GNAS gene encodes the G protein adenylyl cyclase stimulator (Gαs) G protein subunit, which activates cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent pathways by stimulating the adenylyl cyclase. Cognitive and emotional aspects of dispositional empathy were tested using Davis’ Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI). Results In the complete sample, associations of C393T genotype with IRI empathy scores, including cognitive empathy (p = 0.055) and perspective taking (p = 0.057) scores did not reach a level of significance. None of the IRI scores was near to being significantly associated with C393T genotype for men alone. In females, however, genotype was significantly associated with cognitive empathy (r = -.204, p = 0.005) and perspective taking (r = -.209, p = 0.004), accounting for 4.2% and 4.4% of variability. The association of genotype with perspective taking remained significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons (p = 0.045). The 393C-allele, which had been identified as a risk factor in several medical conditions such as hypertension, obesity and diabetes, was associated with higher cognitive empathy compared to the T allele in our sample. Conclusions The results suggest a significant association of GNAS C393T genotypes with the cognitive empathic capacity of perspective taking. This association could only be found in female participants."
https://openalex.org/W2949554306,"Understanding biological response to stimuli requires identifying mechanisms that coordinate changes across pathways. One of the promises of multi-omics studies is achieving this level of insight by simultaneously identifying different levels of regulation. However, computational approaches to integrate multiple types of data are lacking. An effective systems biology approach would be one that uses statistical methods to detect signatures of relevant network motifs and then builds metabolic circuits from these components to model shifting regulatory dynamics. For example, transcriptome and metabolome data complement one another in terms of their ability to describe shifts in physiology. Here, we extend a previously described linear-modeling based method used to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with metabolic changes. We apply this strategy to link changes in sulfur, amino acid and lipid production under heat stress by relating ratios of compounds to potential precursors and regulators. This approach provides integration of multi-omics data to link previously described, discrete units of regulation into functional pathways and identifies novel biology relevant to the heat stress response, in addition to generating hypotheses."

Besides morphological changes, relaxation times and diffusion capacity of involved bowel segments can be obtained by MRI. The aim of this study was to assess the use of multiparametric MRI in the diagnosis of experimentally induced colitis in mice, and evaluate the diagnostic benefit of parameter combinations using machine learning. This study relied on colitis induction by Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS) and investigated the colon of mice in vivo as well as ex vivo. Receiver Operating Characteristics were used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive- and negative-predictive values (PPV and NPV) of these single values in detecting DSS-treatment as a reference condition. A Model Averaged Neural Network (avNNet) was trained on the multiparametric combination of the measured values, and its predictive capacity was compared to those of the single parameters using exact binomial tests. Within the in vivo subgroup (n = 19), the avNNet featured a sensitivity of 91.3% (95% CI: 86.6-96.0%), specificity of 92.3% (95% CI: 85.1-99.6%), PPV of 96.9% (94.0-99.9%) and NPV of 80.0% (95% CI: 69.9-90.1%), significantly outperforming all single parameters in at least 2 accuracy measures (p < 0.003) and performing significantly worse compared to none of the single values. Within the ex vivo subgroup (n = 30), the avNNet featured a sensitivity of 87.4% (95% CI: 82.6-92.2%), specificity of 82.9% (95% CI: 76.1-89.7%), PPV of 88.9% (84.3-93.5%) and NPV of 80.8% (95% CI: 73.8-87.9%), significantly outperforming all single parameters in at least 2 accuracy measures (p < 0.015), exceeded by none of the single parameters. In experimental mouse colitis, multiparametric MRI and the combination of several single measured values to an avNNet can significantly increase diagnostic accuracy compared to the single parameters alone. This pilot study will provide new avenues for the development of an MR-derived colitis score for optimized diagnosis and surveillance of inflammatory bowel disease."
https://openalex.org/W2898516461,"Uncaria guianensis is native to the Amazon and is used traditionally as an anti-inflammatory. Natural populations of the species have declined markedly in recent times because of strong anthropic pressure brought about by deforestation and indiscriminate collection. The aim of the present study was to assess the genetic and chemical diversity among eight natural populations of U. guianensis located in the Brazilian states of Acre, Amapá and Amazonas. A set of four primer combinations was employed in sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) amplifications of leaf DNA, and the fragments were analyzed in an LI-COR model 4300 DNA Analyzer. Genetic variability within the populations (81%) was substantially greater than that detected between them (19%). The highest percentage of polymorphic loci (90.21%) and the largest genetic variability were observed in the population located in Mazagão, Amapá. Genetic differentiation between populations was high (Fst = 0.188) and the studied populations formed three distinct genetic groups (K = 3). The population located in Assis Brasil, Acre, presented the highest average content of the mitraphylline (0.60 mg/g dry weight,). However, mitraphylline and isomitraphylline not detected in most individuals in the studied populations, and it is questionable whether they should be considered as chemical markers of the species. The genetic data confirm the urgent need for conservation programs for U. guianensis, and for further studies aimed at ascertaining the genetic basis and heritability of alkaloid accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2898165611,"This study evaluated the effects of childhood experiences of parental corporal punishment (CP) and neglectful parenting (NP) on Japanese university students’ endorsement of parental CP (EPP) to discipline children, in relation to subjective happiness (SH). A total of 536 undergraduate students who showed no physical symptoms completed anonymous paper-based questionnaires addressing demographic characteristics, undergraduate classes, and recent health conditions on SF-8 (PCS, MCS). It was found that the proportions of participants who experienced pervasive CP and NP were larger in men than in women (36.5% vs. 19.4% for CP; 22.1% vs. 9.7% for NP). Multiple regression analyses (n = 346) revealed that the CP score was associated with positive EPP (β = 0.310, p < 0.001). Further, students whose major was nursery education reported significantly lower level of EPP; however, neither SH nor good recent health conditions significantly reduced EPP. The NP score was inversely associated with the SH score (β = -0.253, p < 0.001) (n = 346). In conclusion, childhood experiences of parental CP may affect adolescents’ views related to their own parenting. Further investigation using internationally comparable methodologies, especially in prospective cohort studies, is warranted, not only in Japan but also in other Asian countries."
https://openalex.org/W2898500473,"The design of experimental protocols that use animal models to assess the impact of a stress on a population or to determine the life span expectancy impact can be time-consuming due to the need for direct observations of dead and living animals. These experiments are usually based on the detectable activity of animals such as food intake or mobility and can sometimes produce either under- or overestimated results. The tardigrade Hypsibius exemplaris is an emerging model for the evolutionary biology of the tardigrade phylum because of its convenient laboratory breeding and the recent introduction of new molecular tools. In this report, we describe the use of a new fluorescent dye that can specifically stain dead tardigrades. Furthermore, we also monitored the absence of a toxic side effect of the death-linked fluorescent dye on tardigrade populations. Finally, we conclude that tardigrade experiments that require survival counting of the Hypsibius exemplaris species can be greatly improved by using this technique in order to limit underestimation of alive animals."
https://openalex.org/W2898253134,"The availability of biological information in public databases has increased exponentially. To ensure the accuracy of this information, researchers have adopted several methods and refinements to avoid the dissemination of incorrect information; for example, several automated tools are available for annotation processes. However, manual curation ensures and enriches biological information. Additionally, the genomic finishing process is complex, resulting in increased deposition of drafts genomes. This introduces bias in other omics analyses because incomplete genomic content is used. This is also observed for complete genomes. For example, genomes generated by reference assembly may not include new products in the new sequence or errors or bias can occur during the assembly process. Thus, we developed ImproveAssembly, a tool capable of identifying new products missing from genomic sequences, which can be used for complete and draft genomes. The identified products can improve the annotation of complete genomes and drafts while significantly reducing the bias when the information is used in other omics analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2898454985,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) followed by extensive cell loss, inflammation, and scarring, often permanently damages neurological function. Biomaterial scaffolds are promising but currently have limited applicability in SCI because after entering the scaffold, regenerating axons tend to become trapped and rarelyre-enter the host tissue, the reasons for which remain to be completely explored. Here, we propose a mathematical model and computer simulation for characterizing regenerative axons growing along a scaffold following SCI, and how their growth may be guided. The model assumed a solid, spherical, multifunctional, biomaterial scaffold, that would bridge the rostral and caudal stumps of a completely transected spinal cord in a rat model and would guide the rostral regenerative axons toward the caudal tissue. Other assumptions include the whole scaffold being coated with extracellular matrix components, and the caudal area being additionally seeded with chemoattractants. The chemical factors on and around the scaffold were formulated to several coupled variables, and the parameter values were derived fromexisting experimental data. Special attention was given to the effects of coating strength, seeding location, and seeding density, as well as the ramp slope of the scaffold, on axonal regeneration. In numerical simulations, a slimmer scaffold provided a small slope at the entry ""on-ramp"" area that improved the success rate of axonal regeneration. If success rates are high, an increased number of regenerative axons traverse through the narrow channels, causing congestion and lowering the growth rate. An increase in the number of severed axons (300-12000) did not significantly affect the growth rate, but it reduced the success rate of axonal regeneration. However, an increase in the seeding densities of the complexes on the whole scaffold, and that in the seeding densities of the chemoattractants on the caudal area, improved both the success and growth rates. However, an increase in the density of thecomplexes on the whole scaffold risks an over-eutrophic surface that harms axonal regeneration.Although theoretical predictions are yet to be validated directly by experiments, this theoretical tool can advance the treatment of SCI, and is also applicable to scaffolds with other architectures."
