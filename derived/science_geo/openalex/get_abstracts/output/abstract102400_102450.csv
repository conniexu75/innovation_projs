https://openalex.org/W2052766715,"Mechanical stresses were applied directly to cell surface receptors with a magnetic twisting device. The extracellular matrix receptor, integrin beta 1, induced focal adhesion formation and supported a force-dependent stiffening response, whereas nonadhesion receptors did not. The cytoskeletal stiffness (ratio of stress to strain) increased in direct proportion to the applied stress and required intact microtubules and intermediate filaments as well as microfilaments. Tensegrity models that incorporate mechanically interdependent struts and strings that reorient globally in response to a localized stress mimicked this response. These results suggest that integrins act as mechanoreceptors and transmit mechanical signals to the cytoskeleton. Mechanotransduction, in turn, may be mediated simultaneously at multiple locations inside the cell through force-induced rearrangements within a tensionally integrated cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1653408396,"The oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) in the arterial wall is thought to contribute to human atherosclerotic lesion formation, in part by the high affinity uptake of oxidized LDL (OxLDL) by macrophages, resulting in foam cell formation. We have utilized cloning by expression to identify CD36 as a macrophage receptor for OxLDL. Transfection of a CD36 clone into 293 cells results in the specific and high affinity binding of OxLDL, followed by its internalization and degradation. An anti-CD36 antibody blocks 50% of the binding of OxLDL to platelets and to human macrophage-like THP cells. Furthermore, like mouse macrophages, 293 cells expressing CD36 recognize LDL which has been oxidized only 4 h, whereas more extensive oxidation of the LDL is required for recognition by the other known OxLDL receptors, the acetylated LDL (AcLDL) receptor and Fc gamma RII-B2. CD36 may play a role in scavenging LDL modified by oxidation and may mediate effects of OxLDL on monocytes and platelets in atherosclerotic lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2089193539,"The mechanisms by which mammals discriminate a vast array of diverse odors are poorly understood. To gain insight into the organizational strategies underlying this discriminatory capacity, we have examined the spatial distribution of odorant receptor RNAs in the mouse olfactory epithelium. We have observed topographically distinct patterns of receptor RNAs suggesting that the nasal cavity is divided into a series of expression zones. The zones exhibit bilateral symmetry in the two nasal cavities and are organized along the dorsal-ventral and medial-lateral axes. Within each zone, a neuron may select a gene for expression from a zonal gene set via a stochastic mechanism. The observed zonal patterning may serve as an initial organizing step in olfactory sensory information coding."
https://openalex.org/W2008976996,"Sry is expressed at higher levels in the adult testis, where no function has been determined, than in the genital ridge, its critical site of action. cDNA and 5' RACE clones isolated from testis or from Sry-transfected cell lines have an unusual structure, with 3' sequences located in a 5' position. RNAase protection assays and reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions confirmed that these unusual RNA molecules represent the most abundant transcript in testis. Furthermore, oligonucleotide hybridization and RNAase H digestion proved that these Sry RNA molecules are circular. Similar transcripts were detected in the testes of mice with Mus musculus musculus, Mus musculus domesticus, and Mus spretus Sry genes. The circular RNA is found in the cytoplasm but is not substantially bound to polysomes. We suggest that the circles arise from normal splicing processes as a consequence of the unusual genomic structure surrounding the Sry locus in the mouse."
https://openalex.org/W2017329375,"We have determined the gene structure for the NMDA receptor subunit gene NMDAR1. We found eight splice variants that arise from different combinations of a single 5' terminal exon insertion and three different 3' terminal exon deletions, relative to NMDAR1. We analyzed the modulation by Zn2+ of currents through homomeric receptors assembled from these splice variants and found that, in addition to its well-known inhibitory effect at high concentrations, Zn2+ potentiates agonist-induced currents at submicromolar concentrations (EC50 = 0.50 microM). This potentiation is observed only with a subset of NMDAR1 splice variants that show additional differences in pharmacological properties. Zn2+ potentiation is rapidly reversible, noncompetitive with either glutamate or glycine, and voltage independent. Zn2+ potentiation is mimicked by Cd2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+, but not by Mn2+, Co2+, Fe3+, Sn2+, or Hg2+. Our results suggest a possible role for Zn2+ as a positive modulator of NMDA receptors in certain regions of the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2027646146,"Actin filaments are highly concentrated in postsynaptic densities at central excitatory synapses, but their influence on postsynaptic glutamate receptors is unknown. We tested whether actin depolymerization influences NMDA channel activity in whole-cell recording on cultured hippocampal neurons. The ATP- and calcium-dependent rundown of NMDA channels was prevented when actin depolymerization was blocked by phalloidin. Rundown of AMPA/kainate receptors was unaffected by phalloidin. Cytochalasins, which enhance actin-ATP hydrolysis, induced NMDA channel rundown, whereas taxol or colchicine, which stabilize or disrupt microtubule assembly, had no effect. Protease inhibitors also had no effect. Our results suggest that calcium and ATP can influence NMDA channel activity by altering the state of actin polymerization and are consistent with a proposed model in which actin filaments compartmentalize a channel regulatory protein."

In a cellular assay, gene-specific antisense inhibition occurred at nanomolar concentrations of oligonucleotide, was dose-dependent and exquisitely sensitive to sequence mismatches, and was correlated with the melting temperature and length of oligonucleotide. Activity was independent of RNA target site and cell type but was detectable only when the oligonucleotides were microinjected or delivered with cell-permeabilizing agents. These oligonucleotides may have important applications in therapy and in studies of gene function."

https://openalex.org/W2066138756,"Antigen receptors on B and T lymphocytes transduce signals by activating nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs). A family of receptor PTKs contains kinase insert regions with the sequence tyrosine-X-X-methionine (where X is any amino acid) that when phosphorylated mediate the binding and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). The CD19 membrane protein of B cells enhances activation through membrane immunoglobulin M (mIgM) and was found to contain a functional analog of the kinase insert region. Ligation of mIgM induced phosphorylation of CD19 and association with PI 3-kinase. Thus, CD19 serves as a surrogate kinase insert region for mIgM by providing the means for PI 3-kinase activation by nonreceptor PTKs."
https://openalex.org/W1638694981,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) plays a central role in transepithelial ion transport by acting as a tightly regulated apical chloride channel. Regulation is achieved by the concerted action of ATP at conserved nucleotide binding folds and serine phosphorylation at multiple sites by protein kinases A (PKA) and C (PKC). A previous investigation concluded that activation by PKA is critically dependent on phosphorylation at four of the nine predicted PKA sites in the R domain (S660A, S737A, S795A, S813A), because a Quad mutant lacking these sites could not be activated. We show in the present work that not only can this mutant be phosphorylated and activated, but a mutant in which all 10 predicted PKA sites have been altered still retains significant PKA-activated function. Potentiation of the PKA response by PKC is also preserved in this mutant. Thus CFTR may be regulated by cryptic PKA sites which also mediate interactions between different kinases. Such hierarchical phosphorylation of CFTR by obvious and cryptic PKA sites could provide a metered response to secretagogues."

https://openalex.org/W2145737940,"A 17 amino acid peptide containing the arginine-rich region of the HIV Rev protein binds specifically to Rev response element (RRE) RNA. Even though it is highly charged, the peptide forms an alpha helix in solution, but only when its N- and C-termini are modified to provide favorable electrostatic interactions with the helix macrodipole. Binding affinity for IIB RNA (the primary binding site within the RRE) increases with alpha helix content, whereas nonspecific binding affinity is independent of helix content. Binding of mutant peptides demonstrates that one threonine, one asparagine, and four arginine side chains are important for sequence-specific recognition. Transactivation of the HIV LTR using Tat-Rev peptide hybrids and the RRE IIB site indicates that the peptide adopts an alpha-helical conformation in vivo. The results suggest that interactions with the RNA backbone may help to orient the alpha helix in the major groove of RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1590348341,"The role of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in the cytotoxic action of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was examined. Recently, we described the characterization of TNF-resistant sublines isolated from TNF-sensitive cell line L929 (Hayakawa, M., Oku, N., Takagi, T., Hori, T., Shibamoto, S., Yamanaka, Y., Takeuchi, K., Tsujimoto, M., and Ito, F. (1991) Cell Struct. Funct. 16, 333-340). The most remarkable features of these TNF-resistant sublines were the defects in TNF-stimulated arachidonate metabolism. In this study, we characterized the PLA2 activities of these sublines and found a significant decrease in the activity in one of the TNF-resistant sublines, C12 cells. The enzymological features, such as Ca2+ requirement and substrate specificity, suggested that the high molecular weight arachidonoyl-selective cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) was involved in the TNF action. Northern hybridization analysis demonstrated the reduced expression of high molecular weight cPLA2 in C12 cells. Furthermore, expression of a cloned cPLA2 cDNA in C12 cells increased the sensitivity of cells to the TNF cytotoxicity. These results indicate the crucial role of the high molecular weight cPLA2 in the TNF-induced cytolysis."

Rods and each type of cones express genetically related yet different forms of photopigments. Enzymes that control the light-stimulated hydrolysis of cGMP in rods and cones are also the product of distinct genes. Two different cDNA clones encoding cGMP-gated channels have been characterized from the chicken retina. Expression of cDNAs in Xenopus oocytes gives rise to cGMP-stimulated channel activity. Antibodies against a synthetic peptide specific for the C-terminal amino acid sequence derived from one clone stain outer segments of cone but not rod photoreceptors. Therefore chicken rod and cone cells each express different forms of cGMP-gated channels that are genetically related to each other.

https://openalex.org/W1563545308,"We examined the involvement of tyrosine kinase activity in the bradykinin (BK)-mediated signal transduction process. Immunoblots with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies following BK stimulation of human fibroblasts showed tyrosine phosphorylation of specific proteins that could be inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and tyrphostin. Image analysis data from individual cells stimulated by BK in the presence of genistein and tyrphostin showed that these inhibitors block the plateau phase but not the rapid transient phase of the BK-induced calcium response. That the loss of the plateau phase was due to blockage of calcium entry rather than stimulation of calcium pump activity was confirmed by examining the influx of Ba2+ following BK stimulation. The Ca2+ imaging results were confirmed by 45Ca2+ uptake measurements and extended to another tyrosine kinase inhibitor (methyl 2,5-dihydroxycinnamate), which was found to interfere with the fura-2 signal and therefore could not be used in imaging experiments. The fact that three structurally distinct inhibitors of tyrosine kinase activity inhibited BK-stimulated calcium influx, while an inactive analogue of genistein (daidzein) did not, strongly suggests the involvement of tyrosine kinases in the regulation of a BK-induced calcium entry pathway. To our knowledge, this is the first report of tyrosine kinase involvement in the regulation of calcium entry following activation of a receptor that lacks endogenous tyrosine kinase activity and is known to be coupled to phosphatidylinositol turnover. We found that calcium entry in HSWP (human foreskin fibroblast) cells can also be stimulated by emptying the intracellular calcium stores with thapsigargin. Genistein also inhibits the plateau phase of the thapsigargin-induced calcium response while leaving the transient phase intact. This suggests that the Ca2+ influx pathway induced by depletion of intracellular calcium stores with thapsigargin also may be regulated via a tyrosine kinase pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2076860978,"Animal cap explants from Xenopus embryos injected with a dominant negative Raf-1 mutant, termed NAF (not a functional Raf), demonstrated a complete block to basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-stimulated mesoderm induction. Activin induction of mesoderm was normal in embryos that expressed NAF. Injection of NAF RNA into 2-cell stage embryos blocked normal development during neurula stages and caused severe posterior truncations in tadpoles. The phenotype induced by NAF could be rescued by coinjection of wild-type raf-1 RNA. The NAF mutant functioned by specifically blocking the activation of endogenous Raf kinase activity. These findings suggest that Raf-1 mediates FGF, but not activin, receptor signaling during mesoderm induction and implicate Raf-1 as a key signaling molecule in the development of posterior structure."
https://openalex.org/W1485297726,"Abstract Active proteolytic fragments of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-delta 1 (PLC-delta 1) were generated by trypsin digestion of the native protein. Brief proteolysis produced a 77-kDa fragment that contained the highly conserved X and Y regions but lacked the amino-terminal domain (amino acids 1-60). Prolonged digestion of PLC-delta 1 produced two fragments, one of 45 kDa that contained the entire X region and another of 32 kDa that consisted of the entire Y region and COOH-terminal domain. The 45- and 32-kDa fragments were isolated as an active heterodimeric complex. The 77-kDa fragment and the complex catalyzed calcium-dependent hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in detergent/phospholipid mixed micelles. When compared with the native enzyme, both the 77-kDa fragment and the complex exhibited a reduced capacity to processively hydrolyze PIP2; increasing the mole fraction of PIP2 in the mixed micelle surface greatly increased the rate of PIP2 hydrolysis catalyzed by the native enzyme but not the fragments. Both fragments also exhibited a reduced affinity for substrate; the native enzyme bound to bilayer vesicles consisting of phosphatidylcholine and PIP2 with high affinity (Ka approximately 10(6) M-1), whereas the fragments bound weakly (Ka < 10(4) M-1). These results demonstrate that the X, Y, and COOH-terminal regions form a calcium-dependent catalytic core that is resistant to proteolysis. The amino-terminal domain appears to be essential for high affinity binding to PIP2 but not catalysis. These observations are consistent with the idea that the amino-terminal domain forms part of a PIP2 binding site, which anchors PLC-delta 1 to the membrane surface during processive hydrolysis of its substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2018526617,"Mitochondrial large ribosomal RNA (mtlrRNA) has been identified as a cytoplasmic factor that induces pole cell formation in embryos whose ability to form a germ line has been abolished by treatment with ultraviolet light. In situ hybridization analyses reveal that mtlrRNA is enriched in germ plasm and is tightly associated with polar granules, the distinctive organelles of germ plasm, which supports the idea that mtlrRNA functions in pole cell formation. This suggests that a product from the mitochondrial genome, along with nuclear products, participates in a key event in embryonic development: determination of the germ line."

https://openalex.org/W1495481916,"We have investigated the role of protein kinase C (PKC) in human melanogenesis. The level of PKC activity paralleled the total melanin content in cultured newborn melanocytes. Activation of PKC by treatment with 5 x 10(-7) M phorbol dibutyrate acutely caused a doubling in the activity of tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in melanogenesis, known to correlate directly with melanin synthesis in these cells. When PKC was depleted to 5-10% of initial levels, there was a 40-50% parallel reduction in tyrosinase activity; and regeneration of PKC activity was associated with the recovery of tyrosinase activity. By Northern blot analysis, the alpha and beta but not the gamma isoforms were detectable in melanocytes. By Western blot analysis, the racially determined pigment level in cultured melanocytes correlated with PKC-beta protein expression. In a pigmented human melanoma line (P-MM4, 20-30 ng melanin/micrograms protein)and its nonpigmented subclone (NP-MM4, undetectable melanin), PKC-alpha mRNA was expressed in both, whereas PKC-beta mRNA was detectable only in P-MM4 cells. Tyrosinase protein level was comparable in both cell lines. When NP-MM4 cell lysate was incubated with melanocyte lysate known to contain PKC-beta, tyrosinase activity per microgram of melanocyte protein in the combined lysate increased, consistent with activation of the previously inactive tyrosinase of NP-MM4 origin. Moreover, NP-MM4 cells transiently transfected with PKC-beta cDNA increased tyrosinase activity from undetectable to detectable levels. These combined data show that PKC-beta regulates human melanogenesis by activating tyrosinase."
https://openalex.org/W1567381189,"The catalytic properties of electrophoretically homogeneous RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRP, EC 2.7.7.48) from tomato leaf tissue were studied with the aid of oligonucleotides of defined sequence. It was found that RdRP catalyzes in vitro the transcription of short single-stranded RNA and DNA molecules into precisely complementary RNA copies up to the full length of these templates. The transcription of RNA- and DNA-oligonucleotide templates was equally effective. Differences in transcription efficiency were found to depend on nucleotide sequence rather than on the RNA or DNA nature of the single-stranded nucleic acid. Double-stranded nucleic acids such as poly(A).poly(U) and a double-stranded DNA 14-mer were not transcribed. The RdRP-directed transcription could be primed because RNA and DNA dinucleotides and trinucleotides complementary to the 3'-terminal nucleotides of the template were extended by the enzyme. The unprimed transcription was shown to start preferentially at the 3'-terminal nucleotides of the template. RdRP is capable of adding a single noncomplementary nucleotide to the 3' terminus of about 50% of the runoff transcripts. AMP was preferred over GMP, whereas CMP and UMP were terminally added at very low frequency."

https://openalex.org/W2050352537,"Overlapping cDNAs encoding the entire heavy chain of cytoplasmic dynein (MAP 1C) have been obtained. A 4644 amino acid polypeptide containing four ATP-binding consensus sequences is predicted. Homology with the sea urchin flagellar outer arm dynein beta heavy chain is observed within the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein. The N-terminal third of the two polypeptides shows no clear relationship, suggesting that this region of MAP 1C is responsible for its association with retrograde organelles and other functions. Northern blot analysis reveals a 16.5 kb band in brain and other tissues. Southern blot analysis is consistent with a single cytoplasmic dynein gene. Thus, in contrast with cilia and flagella, which contain numerous forms of dynein, our results are consistent with the existence of only a single cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain gene, which appears to produce only a single transcript."
https://openalex.org/W1571092378,"Glutathione peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.9) is one of a unique group of prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes that contain the unusual amino acid selenocysteine. The genes for these selenoproteins encode for the atypical amino acid at a TGA codon (UGA in the mRNA transcripts), which normally functions as a termination signal. The present studies analyzed the functional importance of sequences in the coding and 3'-untranslated regions of transcripts of the primary human cellular glutathione peroxidase gene (GPX1) to the insertion of at this UGA codon. Deletions in potential stem-loop or hairpin structures in the coding region did not substantially diminish incorporation of into glutathione peroxidase transiently expressed by the pCMV4 vector in COS-1 cells. However, insertion was completely abolished by deletion of four-nucleotide sequences in the 3'-untranslated region from within a conserved selenocysteine insertion motif also found in the 3'-untranslated region of mammalian genes for other selenoproteins. Moreover, in constructs fusing the glutathione peroxidase 3'-untranslated region to the coding region of rab5b (an unrelated protein normally without any selenium moiety), the glutathione peroxidase 3'-untranslated region was sufficient to direct the translation of an opal (UGA) mutation as selenocysteine. Thus, our data directly demonstrate the importance of the insertion motif in the glutathione peroxidase gene and specifically show that sequence elements in the 3'-untranslated region are both necessary and sufficient for translational insertion of at a UGA codon in eukaryotic mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1532941171,"An RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRP, EC 2.7.7.48) from tomato leaf tissue was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. A terminal transferase activity that was found to cofractionate with RdRP from DEAE-Sepharose and DNA-cellulose columns was removed by chromatography on a Mono Q column. The highly purified RdRP exhibits a specific activity of 500 nmol x mg-1 x 30 min-1, which corresponds to a 100,000-fold enrichment of the enzyme. In buffer containing 50% glycerol, its activity decreased by about 15%/month. RdRP activity coincided with the silver staining intensity of a single 128-kDa polypeptide when the fractions eluted from the Mono Q column were analyzed by electrophoresis in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Its molecular mass and its sedimentation coefficient of 6.6 S indicate that RdRP is a nearly globular molecule. The catalytic activity of RdRP is resistant to alpha-amanitin and actinomycin D. In tomato leaves systemically infected with potato spindle tuber viroid, the activity of RdRP was found to be increased about 3-fold compared with RdRP isolated from healthy leaf tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1572960817,"The synthesis rates of DNA, rRNA, bulk mRNA, protein, and RNA polymerase beta- and beta'-subunits were determined as functions of growth rate in a wild-type Escherichia coli strain, which produces guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp), and in a delta relA delta spoT mutant which does not produce ppGpp. The rate of stable RNA synthesis per amount of protein depends on three factors: RNA polymerase concentration, RNA polymerase activity, and the distribution of active RNA polymerase between stable and mRNA genes, measured as the stable RNA synthesis rate/total RNA synthesis rate, rs/rt. In the wild-type strain, all three factors increase with growth rate. In the ppGpp-deficient strains, only RNA polymerase synthesis and activity, but not rs/rt, increased with growth rate. Thus, adjustments of rs/rt require ppGpp. In the absence of ppGpp, the synthesis of rRNA and bulk mRNA both varied in direct proportion to the concentration of active RNA polymerase, in contrast to the wild-type strain, in which only rRNA synthesis increased with growth rate, while mRNA synthesis remained constant. Thus, a control specific for rRNA is absent in strains lacking ppGpp. In rich media, the ppGpp-deficient strain synthesized up to 4-fold more mRNA than wild-type bacteria, which was associated with a similarly increased RNA polymerase activity. We propose that RNA polymerase is rendered inactive in wild-type bacteria due to ppGpp-dependent transcriptional pausing during the synthesis of mRNA. Finally, the control of replication initiation was altered in ppGpp-less bacteria, apparently reflecting indirect changes in the cell physiology, rather than a direct effect of ppGpp on replication initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1583092524,"Vitronectin is an adhesive glycoprotein that binds to the extracellular matrix and interacts with integrin receptors on the surface of adherent cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that the conformationally altered, heparin binding form of vitronectin is removed from the matrix by receptor-mediated endocytosis and degraded through a lysosomal pathway (Panetti, T. S., and McKeown-Longo, P. J. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 11988-11993). The present studies were undertaken to determine the role of cell surface integrins in the endocytosis and degradation of vitronectin. RGDS peptides, used to disrupt the binding of vitronectin to cell surface integrins, inhibited degradation of vitronectin but had no effect on the binding of vitronectin to the cell layer. Localization of vitronectin in the cell layer by indirect immunofluorescence indicated that the RGDS peptides inhibited degradation by preventing the internalization of vitronectin by the cells. To determine which vitronectin receptor was involved in mediating the endocytosis, vitronectin degradation was measured in the presence of monoclonal antibodies. Antibodies against the alpha v beta 5 but not the alpha v beta 3 integrin inhibited degradation of vitronectin by 80%. This study demonstrates a new role for integrins in regulating internalization and degradation of molecules from the extracellular matrix."

The 2.8-A structure of the phosphocarrier protein, HPr from Escherichia coli, complexed to the Fab fragment of the monoclonal antibody, Jel42, has been determined. This allows the first comparison of epitope predictions from extensive site-directed mutagenesis experiments, coupled with biological activity studies (Sharma, S., Georges, F., Klevit, R. E., Delbaere, L. T. J., Lee, J. S., and Waygood, E. B. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 4877-4881), with those from x-ray analysis. There are 14 amino acid residues of E. coli HPr that interact with the Jel42 antigen-binding site. Nine of these were correctly assigned by the mutagenesis studies. Of the 5 remaining residues, Met-1 could not be altered; two others appear to have critical roles in determining protein conformation; the other 2 residues have a minimal effect on antibody binding since they are located on the periphery of the epitope with one face of their side chains in van der Waals contact with the antibody and the other face in contact with solvent. Four residues were incorrectly assigned to the epitope. These residues were located adjacent to epitope residues that were likely perturbed by these mutations. This study demonstrates that mutations which caused greater than 10-fold changes in antibody binding affinity were correctly assigned to the epitope by the mutagenesis experiments. Guidelines are also presented in order to minimize incorrect assignments."

https://openalex.org/W1579838330,"A major unresolved issue in the area of signal transduction relates to the role of particular isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC) in mediating cellular responses subsequent to activation of that enzyme. We have addressed this issue by the use of antisense technology. We have stably transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells with antisense PKC alpha, PKC beta, or both PKC alpha and -beta cDNAs. The transfected cDNA was integrated and expressed. We have isolated cells in which expression of PKC alpha is inhibited. In cells transfected with antisense PKC alpha or both PKC alpha and -beta, phorbol ester-stimulated release of arachidonate and its metabolites was inhibited, whereas in cells transfected with antisense PKC beta cDNA alone, phorbol ester-stimulated arachidonate release was not significantly different from control cells. We thus demonstrate the use of a novel technique to inhibit PKC isoform expression. We show that inhibition of expression of PKC alpha causes a loss in phospholipase A2-mediated arachidonate release. Antisense-inhibited expression of PKC isoforms may provide a useful approach to define additional functions of particular PKC isoforms."

Both stearic acid and palmitic acid were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of alkaline hydrolysates of purified P-selectin. Deletion or mutation of Cys766 eliminated [3H] palmitic acid labeling of P-selectin in transfected COS-7 cells.

R., Cohn, J. A., Bertuzzi, G., Greengard, P., and Nairn, A. C. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 12742-12752), but so far the functional effect of the PKC-dependent phosphorylation has not been clarified. We investigated the effect of PKC on the CFTR-mediated Cl- transport by treating with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), the cell line C127i stably expressing CFTR wild type (C127 CFTRw/t), or CFTR bearing the most common mutation deltaF508 (C127 CFTRdF508). We show that PMA activates Cl- efflux in C127 CFTRw/t, but not in C127 CFTRdF508 and C127i. The PMA-dependent activation of CFTR is not mediated by increase of intracellular [cAMP] and is not the result of a primary activation of a K+ conductive pathway. These results strongly suggest that PKC activates directly CFTR-mediated Cl- transport."
https://openalex.org/W1588521281,"Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a gastrointestinal hormone that acts through a G protein-coupled receptor to stimulate pancreatic enzyme secretion. In this work, we demonstrate that CCK stimulation of dispersed pancreatic acini results in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins. This is mediated via a calcium-dependent pathway, also activated by a phenethyl ester analogue of CCK and calcium ionophores, and by a protein kinase C-dependent cascade, also activated by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. All demonstrable stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation events were inhibited by genistein, with different subsets of proteins affected by staurosporine and H-7. The importance of tyrosine phosphorylation events in agonist-stimulated amylase secretion was studied using genistein and staurosporine as protein kinase inhibitors. Genistein inhibited the secretory response to CCK, its phenethyl ester analogue, and calcium ionophores, all known to stimulate secretion in a calcium-dependent fashion. In contrast, genistein had no effect on the secretory response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, suggesting that the protein kinase C-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation events were not involved in the secretory mechanism. Furthermore, CCK-induced secretion was not affected by relatively specific protein kinase C inhibition by H-7, but was decreased by staurosporine, an inhibitor of both protein kinase C and tyrosine kinase activities in these cells. These results provide evidence that acinar cell tyrosine phosphorylation is stimulated by agonists acting via calcium-dependent and protein kinase C-dependent pathways, with only the calcium-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation cascade involved in triggering hormone-induced amylase release."
https://openalex.org/W1522673104,"Vitronectin is a structurally labile molecule with a native, non-heparin binding form and a conformationally altered, heparin binding form. To understand the physiological significance of the two conformers of vitronectin, we examined the metabolism of both conformers by cultured human skin fibroblasts. Both native and altered vitronectin bound to confluent fibroblast monolayers. Both conformers of vitronectin competed equally well for the binding of altered vitronectin to the cell layer, suggesting that both conformers bound to the same site in the cell layer. In contrast, 125I-altered vitronectin, but not 125I-native vitronectin, was degraded to trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity by the fibroblast monolayer. Degradation of vitronectin was saturable, sensitive to chloroquine, and occurred intracellularly, suggesting that vitronectin was degraded through a lysosomal pathway. Heparin and thrombospondin inhibited the degradation of altered vitronectin. The degradation of native vitronectin was induced by addition of gamma-thrombin which exposes vitronectin's cryptic heparin-binding domain. These studies suggest that the heparin-binding domain in vitronectin is required for the clearance of vitronectin from the matrix. In addition, these data demonstrate that the conformation of vitronectin regulates its half-life in the matrix. These studies provide the first evidence for a distinct function for the conformers of vitronectin."
https://openalex.org/W1525697035,"Abstract Previous kinetic studies have characterized the intracellular folding pathway of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-beta subunit in which each of the folding intermediates can be biochemically identified based on the formation of disulfide (S-S) bonds: p beta 1-early--> p beta 1-late--> p beta 2-free--> p beta 2-combined--> native hCG-alpha beta. Based on these data, we postulated that hCG-beta folding coincides with the formation of specific S-S bonds. We have now tested this hypothesis employing Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with mutated hCG-beta genes in which the Cys residues required for the formation of the final four (of six total) S-S bonds were replaced by Ala. When the Cys residues required for the third hCG-beta S-S linkage to form (bond 9-90) were substituted, folding did not proceed beyond the earliest detectable folding intermediate (p beta 1-early). In the absence of the subsequently formed S-S bond (bond 23-72), p beta 1-early was converted into a second folding intermediate (p beta 1-late), but conversion to the next intermediate (p beta 2-free) was inhibited. When either of the final two S-S bonds (the carboxyl-terminal 93-100 or 26-110 bonds) were removed, conversion of p beta 1-late to p beta 2-free was detected, but conversion of p beta 2-free to the last folding intermediate (p beta 2-combined) was not observed. These data support the hypothesis that individual S-S bonds are involved in discrete steps in the hCG-beta folding pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1495510097,"Abstract Actinomycin Synthetase II (ACMS II), which activates threonine and valine by a thioltemplate mechanism during the synthesis of the actinomycin half-molecule 4-methyl-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (4-MHA) pentapeptide lactone, was purified to near homogeneity from Streptomyces chrysomallus. It is a single polypeptide chain of M(r) 280,000 and contains 4'-phosphopantetheine as a covalently bound prosthetic group. ACMS II charges itself with threonine but not with the 4-MHA analogue p-toluic acid via a specific sulfhydryl group at the expense of ATP. Charging of ACMS II with p-toluic acid in thioester linkage took place, however, only when actinomycin synthetase I (ACMS I), a 4-MHA-AMP ligase, was present. In the additional presence of L-threonine, enzyme-bound p-toluyl-L-threonine was formed on ACMS II. The latter compound was also formed when chemically synthesized p-toluic acid adenylate was added instead of ACMS I and p-toluic acid. This indicates that p-toluic acid adenylate is a free intermediate in the reaction and that charging of the enzyme and acylation of threonine are both catalyzed by ACMS II rather than by ACMS I. Chemically synthesized thioesters of p-toluic acid and coenzyme A, pantetheine, or beta-alanyl-cysteamine reacted with ACMS II, threonine, and ATP with formation of enzyme-bound p-toluyl-threonine. In contrast, p-toluyl-cysteamine thioester was inactive, which indicates structural constraints in the reactivity of free thioesters of p-toluic acid with ACMS II. Such constraints obviously require structural similarity of the artificial substrate to a p-toluic acid thioester formed on the enzyme's surface in the course of the reaction. Since free coenzyme A was not involved in the charging of p-toluic acid or in p-toluyl-threonine formation, the sulfhydryl group of the 4'-phosphopantetheine cofactor is most likely the primary acceptor of p-toluic acid (or 4-MHA) in the initiation of peptide lactone formation."
https://openalex.org/W1556070851,"The regenerating proximal tubule epithelium in the rat has striking similarity with rat kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTE) in primary culture (Wallin, A., Zhang, G., Jones, T. W., Jaken, S., and Stevens, J. L. (1992) Lab. Invest. 66, 474-484). We used this in vitro model to investigate mechanisms which may regulate aspects of nephrogenic repair in vivo, and in particular the role of fibroblast (heparin-binding) growth factor type-1 (FGF-1) expression. FGF-1 was present predominantly as a 14.3-kDa polypeptide in rat kidney. Biological activity and mRNA for FGF-1 increased dramatically in primary RPTE in culture along with an increase in a 18.3-kDa FGF-1. Cycloheximide blocked FGF-1 expression in primary culture indicating that the increase represents newly synthesized factor rather than release from the extracellular matrix. The maximal increase in expression occurs after the peak of RPTE proliferation. Activity was not present in the medium but intracellular FGF-1 was released from RPTE by scrape wounding. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that FGF-1 expression increased in regenerating proximal tubule epithelial cells 5 days after nephrotoxic damage. Collectively, the data suggest that autocrine expression of FGF-1 by regenerating proximal tubule epithelial cells plays a role in the regulation of nephrogenic repair."
https://openalex.org/W1566396698,"Antibodies to dermatan sulfate proteoglycan II (decorin) have been used to study various aspects of the structure, function, and occurrence of this proteoglycan. The epitopes of five monoclonal antibodies (7B1, 5D1, 3B3, 6D6, and 1XA) were localized to specific cyanogen bromide fragments of the protein core separated by gel filtration. One large (159 residue) cyanogen bromide peptide was further digested with endoproteinase Lys-C and the peptides separated by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. In this way sequences of a suitable length (21-52 residues) for epitope mapping by synthesis of overlapping hexa- and octapeptides were identified. For each of the five monoclonal antibodies a short linear sequence with antigenic activity, from 4 to 8 amino acids long, depending on the particular antibody, was identified. The locations of the epitopes were correlated with various properties of the protein core predicted from the known amino acid sequence. It was observed that, at most, only one was localized in a region predicted to involve a beta-turn. Although four epitopes were in regions predicted to be moderately hydrophilic, accessible, and flexible, one was located in a hydrophobic sequence predicted to be highly inflexible and inaccessible. The implications of this observation in relation to the function of this proteoglycan are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1644708200,"Abstract A series of monoclonal antibodies against p51/p66 human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) were prepared by immunizing mice with the native enzyme immobilized on nitrocellulose. One of these antibodies, designated 1E8, was found to inhibit both RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent polymerase activities of RT but had no effect on the RNase H activity of the enzyme. This inhibition was noncompetitive with respect to primer/template and competitive with respect to deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP). The extent of 1E8 inhibition of RT polymerase activity decreased with increasing concentrations of dNTP in the incubation but was not affected by changes in primer/template concentration. 1E8 bound equally well in solution to both free RT and to the RT-primer/template complex. However, binding to the latter was significantly reduced by the addition of increasing concentrations of dNTP. The ability of dNTP to inhibit the interaction of 1E8 with the RT-primer/template complex was dependent on the identity of the homopolymeric primer/template used; only that dNTP complementary to the template was effective in this respect. 1E8 bound to the p51/p66 reverse transcriptase heterodimer in solution and reacted with both p51 and p66 subunits of reverse transcriptase on Western blots. The antibody is therefore presumed to recognize a linear surface epitope on the enzyme. 1E8 was found to specifically recognize a peptide with the sequence KKDSTKWRK. This sequence corresponds to residues 65-73 of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, a region identified as highly antigenic by several computer algorithms. Two mutations within this sequence have been identified with resistance to 3'-azido,3'-deoxythymidine. We conclude that residues 65-73 of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase may be at or near the polymerase active site of the enzyme, and may form part of the deoxynucleoside triphosphate binding domain of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1556152770,"Abstract Sea urchin testis-specific H1 and H2B histones (Sp H1 and Sp H2B) are characterized by reversibly phosphorylated N-terminal regions consisting largely of multiple clustered SPKK tetrapeptides (serine-proline adjacent to two basic amino acids). This report presents data showing differences in DNA affinities between peptides containing dephosphorylated and phosphorylated N-terminal regions. Sp H1 and its phosphorylated derivative (pSp H1) were purified by hydroxylapatite chromatography. Peptides containing the N-terminal regions of Sp H1 and pSp H1 (NP and pNP, respectively) were produced by digestion with Staphylococcus aureus protease. NP and two forms of pNP differing in phosphate content were purified by DNA-cellulose chromatography. The DNA affinities of the peptides were compared using several criteria. NP was bound more tightly by DNA-cellulose than pNPs. NP precipitated DNA under a broad range of NaCl concentrations; pNPs did not. Both NP and pNPs protected DNA against thermal denaturation, but NP created a more stable DNA-peptide complex. Thirty to sixty times more pNP than NP was required to obtain equivalent inhibition of Hoechst 33258 binding to DNA. NP did not behave as a competitive inhibitor of DNA binding by Hoechst 33258 binding to DNA. We conclude that during spermatogenesis, dephosphorylation of the Sp H1 N-terminal region increases its basicity and thus its affinity for DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1591229203,"We observed that decline of thymidine kinase (TK) enzyme activity was severalfold faster than the decay of full length TK mRNA during growth arrest of 3T6 mouse fibroblasts or during differentiation of myoblasts (C2Cl12) or F9 embryonal carcinoma cells. In order to study the molecular mechanism of this disparate behavior, a polyclonal antiserum against mouse TK was raised in rabbit. High level expression of mouse TK polypeptide in Escherichia coli was achieved with a T7 RNA polymerase-directed expression system. Using the antiserum in immunoblotting, no indication for a pool of inactive enzyme was found during differentiation of F9 or growth arrest of 3T6 cells. Pulse labeling of these cells in vivo with [35S]methionine showed a more than 6-fold decrease in the rate of TK-protein synthesis of in F9 cells after 3 days of treatment with retinoic acid as well as in 3T6 cells after 16 h under low serum. This was not due to increased turnover of the protein as measured in pulse chase experiments. In addition, full length TK mRNA stayed associated with polysomes under these conditions in F9 as well as 3T6 cells. Taken together the results suggest that endogenous TK mRNA becomes translationally repressed under a variety of conditions when mouse cells cease to grow."

https://openalex.org/W1559915299,"Although several tyrosine kinases are present in human neutrophils, little is known regarding the biochemical basis for their activation. We have identified two tyrosine kinase activities in 0.1 and 1% Triton cell extracts of human neutrophils using a non-denaturing gel assay. The first protein tyrosine kinase activity of a faster mobility was associated exclusively with the 0.1% Triton cell extract. The second activity, of slower mobility, was mainly associated with the 0.1% Triton cell extract and to a lesser extent with the 1% Triton cell extract. A modulation of the activities and the distribution of these two tyrosine kinase activities was observed upon stimulation of neutrophils with PDBu (phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate), a direct PKC (protein kinase C) activator. The addition of 1 microM PDBu induced a time-dependent decrease of both tyrosine kinases in the 0.1% Triton cell extract. Although the fast mobility tyrosine kinase activity disappeared completely, the slow mobility tyrosine activity decreased only partially. Concomitantly, an increase in the latter activity was detected in the 1% Triton cell extract. The pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation upon PDBu stimulation was also examined and the results showed that the phorbol ester induced time-dependent increases in the level of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in at least 10 distinct bands. Two lines of evidence indicated that the effects of PDBu were mediated by PKC: 1) The stereo-isomer of PDBu, 4 alpha-PDBu, did not affect the activities and distribution of the tyrosine kinases, and 2) The PKC inhibitor, RO 318220, prevented the redistribution of the tyrosine kinase activities and inhibited the stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation induced by PDBu. These results show that the activity and distribution of at least two human neutrophil tyrosine kinases are modulated after the activation of PKC and that the low mobility tyrosine kinase activity is the most sensitive to PDBu. Based on previous studies, the fast mobility tyrosine kinase activity was likely to be a member of the pp60src tyrosine kinase family and the slower one may be related to the pp93fes. Furthermore, these results begin to define the nature of the relationships among the PKC- and the tyrosine kinase-signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1590241969,"The secretion from the salivary glands in the dipteran Chironomus tentans has previously been shown to contain secretory proteins encoded by a set of related genes belonging to the Balbiani ring multigene family. Here we describe the characterization of a gene for an additional secretory protein of a novel type. This sp240/420 gene is built from virtually identical 477-base pair repeats organized in tandem. The gene exhibits extensive length polymorphism since allelic length variants with from 12 to 22 repeats were recorded. Antibodies have been raised against the gene product, and it is shown also that the protein varies in size between 240 and 420 kDa. The protein is rich in serine and threonine residues (30%) and has N-linked carbohydrate chains, presumably on each repeat. Despite careful preparation of the gland lumen proteins, the sp240/420 protein was found to form protein ladders of regularly degraded protein, suggesting that this degradation occurs naturally in the salivary glands. Although all previously characterized salivary gland secretory protein genes in C. tentans belong to the same multigene family, the sp240/420 gene appears to represent a novel, unrelated type of repetitive gene. The chromosomal location of the gene was mapped and was found to reside in region 17 on chromosome I."
https://openalex.org/W1606143988,"Two distinct receptors, which bind both tumor necrosis factor-alpha and tumor necrosis factor-beta (TNF-alpha and TNF-beta), have been previously identified and cloned from transformed cells. The present study identifies a novel receptor subtype in normal human liver which binds TNF-alpha but not TNF-beta. TNF-alpha but not TNF-beta competes for 125I-TNF-alpha binding and incorporation into affinity-labeled complexes in human liver plasma membranes (HLPM). Antisera to the cloned receptors competed for 125I-TNF-alpha binding to plasma membranes isolated from various transformed cell lines but not to HLPM. However, mRNAs corresponding in size to both known TNF receptors were detected in liver RNA, making it likely that post-transcriptional modifications account for the TNF-alpha specificity of HLPM. These observations suggest that the effects of TNF-alpha and TNF-beta on some normal tissues may be more distinct than previously realized."
https://openalex.org/W2171059532,"A radiation inactivation technique was employed to determine the functional size of adenosine triphosphatase from Escherichia coli (EF0EF1-ATPase). Functional units of the membrane-bound and the soluble ATPases were estimated to be 300 +/- 39 and 295 +/- 32 kDa, respectively. The presence of the free radical scavenger dithiothreitol was crucial in measuring the radiation inactivation size of ATPase. When gramicidin and carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone were added, an increase in the functional mass of membrane-bound ATPase was observed. In contrast, valinomycin and KCl had hardly any effect on the functional size of ATPase. We also determined a functional unit of 355 +/- 33 kDa for proton translocation by a fluorescence quenching technique. A reconstitution study using irradiated coupling factor 1 (EF1)-depleted membrane revealed that the functional mass of the proton channel was 96 +/- 11 kDa. A similar functional size for ATP-Pi exchange and ATP hydrolysis implies that both reactions might utilize identical machinery. Furthermore, functional units of soluble EF1 for unisite (nonsteady state) and multisite (steady state) ATP hydrolysis were calculated as 200 +/- 32 and 298 +/- 32 kDa, respectively. A working hypothesis was proposed from radiation inactivation analysis to elucidate the structure and mechanism of F1-ATPase."
