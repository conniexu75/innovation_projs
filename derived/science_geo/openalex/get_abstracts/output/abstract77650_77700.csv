https://openalex.org/W1588593248,"Abstract Gluconeogenesis from lactate, pyruvate, fructose, glycerol, amino acids, and other compounds was examined in the isolated rat liver perfused with buffer containing blood cells and serum albumin. The following observations were made. The condition of the liver remained good during 2 hours of perfusion at 37° as judged by its gross appearance, oxygen uptake, bile production, water content, and linear rates of glucose production from various substrates. The highest rate of glucose production (about 120 µmoles per g of liver per hour) was observed with saturating concentrations of fructose or dihydroxyacetone. This rate was double that with a saturating level of l-lactate or pyruvate, suggesting that the steps limiting gluconeogenesis from lactate or pyruvate lie before the formation of triose phosphate. The concentration of lactate for half-maximum gluconeogenesis was about 2 mm and that of pyruvate, about 1 mm. The same maximum rate of gluconeogenesis was observed with both substrates. Glycerol, d-glyceraldehyde, l-alanine, or l-serine at high concentrations supported rates of gluconeogenesis about double that found without added substrate (or approximately one-half the maximum rate with l-lactate). d-Lactate, other amino acids, and Krebs cycle intermediates were poor precursors when added singly. With a mixture of amino acids at plasma concentrations, basal glucose production was increased 3-fold and with 1 mm lactate it was doubled. The mean time for conversion of lactate to glucose was 75 sec. The rate of glucose utilization by the liver was low compared with gluconeogenesis. High levels of glucose did not suppress gluconeogenesis from saturating concentrations of lactate. Glucose was the major product of lactate, pyruvate, and fructose metabolism. Lactate production with fructose was greater than that with glucose. With pyruvate-2-14C, there was a 3-fold greater incorporation of isotope into glucose plus glycogen than into CO2. With pyruvate-1-14C, labeling of hexose was much less than that of CO2 and was 38% of that found with pyruvate-2-14C. A mathematical treatment of the isotopic data was developed. With certain assumptions, it was computed that pyruvate was converted to oxalacetate at twice the rate at which it was converted to acetyl coenzyme A, and that most of the acetyl-CoA formed from pyruvate entered the Krebs cycle. It was also deduced that the rate of conversion of oxalacetate to phosphopyruvate was 3-fold greater than the rate of conversion to citrate. There was no correlation between the rates of gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis. Lactate increased glucose production 4-fold but decreased ketogenesis by 70%. Physiological levels of oleate stimulated ketogenesis but not gluconeogenesis in livers from fasted or fed rats. In fed rats, octanoate increased ketogenesis 3-fold but did not affect gluconeogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2159891999,"Abstract The stoichiometry, equilibrium, and kinetic properties of a terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase isolated from calf thymus gland are described. The reaction catalyzed may be written dXTP + d(pY)m (Mg++)/→ d(pY)m(pX)n + nPPi and the ratio of polymer nucleotide to monomer at equilibrium (pH 7.0, 35°) is about 99 when X and Y = adenine. Purine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate polymerizations proceed readily in 8 mm Mg++ at low buffer strengths (40 mm). For deoxyadenosine triphosphate, under these conditions, Km = 1.1 x 10-4 m and Vmax varies from about 0.03 to 0.30 µmole min-1 mg-1 with various oligodeoxynucleotide initiators. At a constant chain length, Km values for oligodeoxynucleotide decrease in the order cytosine g thymine g adenine g guanine g hypoxanthine. Within a homologous series, a limiting value of Km and a maximum value for Vmax are reached at the penta- to septanucleotide. Pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates polymerize best in the presence of 1 mm Co++ at higher buffer strengths (200 mm). Syntheses of polydeoxyadenylate, polydeoxyinosinate, polydeoxycytidylate, and polydeoxythymidylate in greater than 80% yield are achieved under optimal conditions. Preparation of random copolymers is also described."
https://openalex.org/W2062209086,"The (+/-) reference is defined as the result of alternate addition and subtraction and division by N (the number of sample functions). Under suitable conditions both the (+/-) reference and the variable component (noise) of the usual average tend to be derived from the same Gaussian process, and the former can be used as a measure of the latter. This property is most easily applied when the noise is derived from a stationary process. Application of the (+/-) reference and the average of the square of the voltage in studies of evoked response is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1583122397,"In the absence of glucose, significant amounts of labeled pyruvate were converted to glyceride-glycerol by rat epididymal fat pads in vitro. Using specifically labeled pyruvate-14C we found twice as much C-2 incorporated into glyceride-glycerol as C-1. Although this ratio is not affected by changes in dietary conditions, the amount of pyruvate incorporated into glyceride-glycerol is decreased 3-fold in fasted rats as compared to fasted-refed animals. The addition of glucose to the incubation medium depressed the appearance of label in glycerol and stimulated the formation of fatty acids from pyruvate. Under all dietary conditions, over 90% of pyruvate C-1 and 43 to 49% of pyruvate C-2 incorporated into glycerol were in the α carbon atoms. These results indicate the occurrence of the dicarboxylic acid shuttle in adipose tissue and are supported by the following findings: phosphoenolpyruvate-carboxykinase activity is present in soluble and mitochondrial fractions of adipose tissue; its activity increases with fasting when compared to the fasted-refed animal; and it is sufficiently high to account for the observed rates of conversion of pyruvate to glycerol. This pathway, under conditions of glucose deprivation, may supply α-glycerophosphate for the re-esterification of fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W2144233693,"Abstract Holotryptophanase in the presence of K+ undergoes a pH-dependent change (pK 7.2) from a protonated, enzymatically inactive form (EH), λmax 420 mµ, to a deprotonated, active form (E), λmax 337 mµ. Only the inactive form appears when K+, which is required for activity, is replaced by Na+ or imidazole. Both forms of the enzyme are completely inactivated by borohydride reduction, indicating that each contains an azomethine link between coenzyme and apoenzyme. e-Pyridoxyllysine was isolated from the hydrolyzed reduced enzyme in amounts corresponding to the 4 moles of pyridoxal-P that were found by spectrophotometric titration to combine with the native apoenzyme (mol wt 220,000). Interaction with its substrates (or quasisubstrates) to form an ES complex partially protects tryptophanase against inactivation by borohydride reduction, indicating that such interaction replaces the azomethine link from coenzyme to protein with a similar linkage from coenzyme to substrate. On addition of substrates or of competitive inhibitors such as l-alanine, tryptophanase exhibits an absorption maximum near 500 mµ, which disappears as the substrates are decomposed, but remains unchanged in the presence of the inhibitors. Exchange experiments in the presence of D2O or T2O show that the α hydrogen of l-alanine is labilized under these conditions. On these and other grounds, the 500 mµ band is ascribed to a quinonoid intermediate, EX, that lacks the α proton of the bound amino acid. A pK value of 6.65 was determined indirectly for labilization of the α proton of l-alanine, thus indicating the probable participation of an imidazole group of the enzyme in the labilization reaction. The tritium exchange reaction with tryptophan is shown to occur at rates faster than the over-all rate of pyruvate formation. α,β elimination reactions catalyzed by tryptophanase thus occur in two distinct steps: elimination of an α hydrogen from ES to form EX, followed by elimination of the β substituent from EX to form an enzyme-aminoacrylate complex, EA. In conjunction with previous kinetic data, the results show that the β elimination reaction per se is the rate-limiting step. These data thus support fully the mechanism shown in Equation 1 for these reactions. Partial structures for the intermediates are discussed. The pronounced spectral EH (±H+)/⇌ E (±S)/⇌ ES (±H+)/⇌ EX (±R-)/⇌ EA (-E/→/H2O pyruvate + NH3 (1) changes that occur when Na+ replaces K+ in the ionic environment of holotryptophanase indicate important changes in conformation of the active site of the holoenzyme. Such changes are also indicated by differences in the rate of combination of apoenzyme with pyridoxal-P under the two sets of conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2339614621,"Abstract A large amount of an unknown compound is found in urine of patients with isovaleric acidemia, an inborn error of leucine metabolism. Analytical data including nuclear magnetic resonance, mass and infrared spectra are presented, which establish the identity of this compound as N-isovalerylglycine. This report constitutes the first demonstration and isolation of N-isovalerylglycine from human material as well as from any other natural sources. Demonstration of this compound supports the assumption that the enzyme defect in these patients is at the level of conversion of isovaleryl coenzyme A to β-methylcrotonyl coenzyme A."
https://openalex.org/W1569367682,"Abstract A low resolution (4A) electron density map of horse heart cytochrome c crystals has been obtained by x-ray diffraction methods. The molecule is a prolate spheroid, approximately 25 x 25 x 37 A. It has a cleft or crevice along one side into which the heme is inserted, normal to the surface, with only one of the edges of the porphyrin ring exposed to solvent. The ligands occupying coordination positions 5 and 6 of the heme iron extend out from either side of the cleft. The thioether links binding the vinyl side chains of the heme to cysteinyl residues in positions 14 and 17 of the amino acid sequence are visible. One of the iron ligands can be identified from its shape and location as the imidazole side chain of the histidyl residue in position 18. The other is not an imidazole side chain and is probably located in the carboxyl-terminal half of the amino acid sequence. There is little or no α-helix present, the body of the molecule being an extended chain shell around a core of packed hydrophobic side chains."

https://openalex.org/W1598575181,"Abstract Sedimentation equilibrium studies on rabbit tropomyosin have indicated heterogeneity under conditions in which it has previously been considered to exist as a single molecular species. At neutral pH, solutions of tropomyosin consist of a monomer in equilibrium with higher molecular weight species. Molecular weight determinations at high ionic strength by low speed equilibrium sedimentation and osmotic pressure indicate dissociation on dilution to give a value close to 68,000 for the molecular weight at zero concentration. Estimates of the size of the smallest macromolecular species present at both low and high ionic strength were made by the high speed equilibrium technique, and these were in accord with a molecular weight of 68,000 for the native tropomyosin monomer. Determination of molecular weights in 8 m urea by equilibrium sedimentation and osmotic pressure indicate further dissociation to two subunits of molecular weight 33,500. The subunits appear to be very similar in mass and charge, and the results are consistent with a two-chain structure for the native monomer. On the hypothesis that tropomyosin consists of two adjacent α helices, the length of the molecule is approximately 437 A. Although the existence of material other than tropomyosin can be detected in both aqueous buffer and 8 m urea, the results of gel filtration, chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose, and gel electrophoresis suggest that the amounts are insufficient to affect the conclusions of this study."

https://openalex.org/W1553411933,"Abstract It has been demonstrated that the β chain of the hemoglobin of the adult goat (β-A) is replaced by another type of β chain (β-C) during severe anemia from blood loss. Since two adult hemoglobin types (A and B), which differ in their α chains, may be present in the adult goat, both hemoglobin types disappear during anemia and are replaced by two new hemoglobin types. The β-C chain of the goat differs from the β-A chain of the goat by a minimal number of 18 residues and from the β-C chain of the sheep by perhaps only 1 amino acid residue. The β-A chain of the goat differs from the β-A chain of the sheep by perhaps only 4 residues and from the β-B chain of the sheep by perhaps 7 residues. These data suggest a common ancestor of the β-C chains of the goat and the sheep with a divergence of the β-A in the goat and of β-A and β-B in the sheep after the creation of the β-C genes."

https://openalex.org/W1490623476,"Several reagents have been employed to determine the role of the thiol groups in fumarase. The nature of the reaction of these reagents indicates that the thiol groups are not associated with active site structures but are buried in a hydrophobic environment in the interior of the enzyme. Several observations are in accord with this view. The rate of reaction of the thiol groups is much slower in the native, active enzyme than in the unfolded, inactive molecule. The rate of reaction is also a function of the polarity of the thiol reagent. Uncharged aliphatic reagents react faster than more polar reagents. The rate of reaction of a series of alkyl mercury nitrates increases in proportion to the number of methylene groups in the alkyl side chain. In dilute aqueous solutions of aliphatic alcohols, the rate of reaction of p-chloromercuribenzoate with the thiol groups increases with alcohol concentration and the number of methylene groups in the alcohol. The rate of reaction of iodoacetate at pH 6.5 is minimal at 23.5° but increases at lower or higher temperatures. An increase in reactivity at low temperatures appears to occur as a consequence of a decreased strength of hydrophobic interactions at low temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W1580432953,"Abstract The reaction between crystalline human ferroxidase (ferro: O2 oxido-reductase, EC 1.12.3) and the substrate, Fe(II), was studied by a stop-flow method. The rate constants for four separate steps —enzyme-substrate complex formation, separation of product from the enzyme, reoxidation by molecular oxygen, and a rate-determining step—were estimated to be k1 = 1.2 x 106 m-1 sec-1, k2 ≈ 13 sec-1, k3 = 570 x 103 m-1 sec-1, and k'2 = 1.1 sec-1, respectively. The rate-determining process in catalytic action by ferroxidase is possibly a conformational change of the enzyme molecule before the reoxidation. Spectral evidence for the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex in the early stage of the reaction between ferroxidase and Fe(II) was obtained. The lifetime of the enzyme-substrate complex was found to be very short, approximately 40 msec. The sequence of the reaction and possible rate-determining step in ferroxidase activity is discussed, and the data obtained in the present experiment are compared with those reported elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W2070767026,"A new hemoglobin (Hb), Portland 1, has been found in a newborn infant having multiple congenital anomalies and complex autosomal chromosomal mosaicism. The new hemoglobin has a unique tetrameric structure (molecular weight, 66,000) composed of two pairs of different types of chains, neither of which is alpha, gamma(2)x(2). The x-chain of Hb Portland 1 may be a new type of hemoglobin chain, but the available evidence suggests that it may be identical with the epsilon chain. We suggest that Hb Portland 1 is an embryonic hemoglobin that persisted until after birth in relatively large amounts in this patient."
https://openalex.org/W1480940989,"Abstract During the steady state of tryptophan pyrrolase (a hemecontaining dioxygenase) reaction, a new spectral species was observed having absorption maxima at 415, 545, and 580 mµ. This spectrum was due neither to a ferric nor a ferrous state of the heme nor a mixture of both. Since it was observed only in the presence of both tryptophan and oxygen and resembled the spectra of known oxygenated heme protiens, it was interpreted to be due to an oxygenated intermediate, presumably a ternary complex of oxygen, tryptophan, and the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1647158668,"Abstract Tryptophan pyrrolase, measured in an assay where its activity was proportional to its reaction with a specific antiserum, was induced in the liver of adrenalectomized rats by only those tryptophan analogues that also specifically promoted the conjugation of the apotryptophan pyrrolase in vitro and in vivo whether or not these analogues had affinity for the catalytic site of the tryptophan pyrrolase. The apotryptophan pyrrolase induced by hydrocortisone became conjugated upon injection of these analogues, and the elevated level was maintained in vivo as long as sufficient amount of the analogues was present. This action in vivo of the inducers with a site on the enzyme different from the catalytic site was associated with a decreased rate of disappearance of the protein and an increased rate of its synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1498967310,"Abstract Reactivation of diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate inhibited human serum cholinesterase by pyridine-2-aldoxime methiodide and isonitrosoacetophenone has been investigated as a function of reactivator concentration, pH, and temperature in boric acid-borax buffer and in salt solution. Constants shown were the dissociation constants of the diethylphosphoryl cholinesterase reactivator complex for the reactivation by pyridine-2-aldoxime methiodide and the bimolecular rate constants for that by isonitrosoacetophenone. The protonation constants of the diethylphosphoryl cholinesterase were evaluated from the relationship between pH and the dissociation constants of the complex; they indicated a value of 8.4 in buffer medium and 7.8 in salt solution. Changes in reactivation rate and in apparent activation energy of reactivation due to the medium changes may be explained by the nature of the activated complex formed in the respective reactivation processes."

https://openalex.org/W1548973224,"Abstract Glutamate mutase from Clostridium tetanomorphum contains two different protein components or subunits. Purification of Component E has been previously reported. This paper describes the purification of the second protein, Component S, approximately 350-fold in 20 to 25% yield. The purified protein shows no detectable β-methylaspartase or Component E activity, and contains no significant amount of vitamin B6 or vitamin B12 derivatives. When in the reduced state, the enzyme appears to be at least 90% pure. The molecular weight of Component S was found to be 17,000 ± 1,000 by sedimentation equilibrium, sedimentation velocity, and gel filtration techniques. The amino acid composition of the protein was determined. Component S requires incubation with thiols for maximal activity and is inhibited by iodoacetate and arsenite. Out of a total of 5 sulfhydryl groups in the native protein, 1 or 2 appear to be essential for activity. These sulfhydryl groups readily undergo reversible oxidation to form dimer molecules and other inactive oxidized forms when the protein is exposed to air in the absence of thiols. However, the protein is most stable when stored in the absence of thiols. The effect on mutase activity of adding increasing amounts of either component to a fixed amount of the other component suggests that an equilibrium exists between the two components and the active complex. No inhibition occurs at superoptimal levels of either component when they are sufficiently purified. Half-maximal activity is obtained when the molar ratio of Component E to Component S is approximately 1. The insensitivity of Component E to iodoacetate inhibition suggests that the requirement of the mutase reaction for thiols reflects only the necessity of maintaining the sulfhydryl groups of Component S in the reduced state. Greater activity is obtained when Component S is incubated with mercaptoethanol before addition of other assay components than with any other order of addition of the thiol. Increasing the S:E molar ratio 50-fold, from about 0.3 to 16, was shown to decrease the Michaelis constant for the benzimidazolylcobamide coenzyme 40-fold. Binding experiments with dimethylbenzimidazolylcobamide coenzyme showed that Component E alone binds coenzyme weakly, but much more coenzyme is bound when an excess of Component S is present. Component S alone binds little, if any, coenzyme. No stable complex between the mutase components could be detected by gel filtration techniques. No spectral changes were observed upon addition of coenzyme or coenzyme plus substrate to the enzyme components, either separately or together."
https://openalex.org/W1590397388,"Abstract The activation of the apoenzyme of tryptophan pyrrolase in preparations from hydrocortisone-induced rats was shown to consist of two separate, sequential steps, only the second of which is necessary to activate preparations from tryptophan-induced rats. These reactions are as follows. (a) Conjugation of the apoenzyme to the oxidized holoenzyme with hematin supplied by added methemoglobin, a reaction which requires the presence of l-tryptophan or certain analogues and which is inhibited by thiol reagents as well as by globin. (b) Reduction of the oxidized holoenzyme, a reaction which is promoted by l-tryptophan specifically and by ascorbate. It is reversed by oxidation in air in the absence of l-tryptophan. Conjugation is the more rapid of the two reactions, especially at lower temperatures. The over-all activation is, therefore, limited by the rate of reduction. The sites on the apoenzyme and the holoenzyme that react with l-tryptophan for conjugation and catalysis, respectively, are different. They are distinguished by the wider specificity and higher affinity of the site on the apoenzyme involved in conjugation."
https://openalex.org/W206532343,"Abstract Evidence is presented that transglutaminase catalyzes the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate and that this esterolysis occurs at or near a site involved in the other activities of the enzyme. Calcium or strontium is required for this reaction. p-Nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis is effectively inhibited by another transglutaminase substrate, carbobenzoxy (CBZ)-l-glutaminylglycine. Parallel losses in the esterolytic and hydroxamate incorporation activities are observed following treatment of transglutaminase with iodoacetamide. The pH profile for esterolysis is similar, in certain respects, to that for hydroxamate incorporation. The turnover number, 92 ± 13 moles of p-nitrophenol formed min-1 mole of enzyme-1 at pH 6, 24°, in 5% isopropyl alcohol and at saturating levels of calcium ion, is approximately 20- and 100-fold those at pH 8 reported for rabbit muscle 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase and chymotrypsin, respectively. A kinetic evaluation of this calcium-dependent transglutaminase-catalyzed esterolysis reaction shows that the mechanism differs from that of the hydroxamate incorporation reaction. The activator constant (Ka) of calcium (0.8 ± 0.25 x 10-3 m at pH 6, 24°) and the apparent dissociation constant (K'd) determined for the metal-enzyme complex by equilibrium dialysis (1 ± 0.6 x 10-3 m at pH 7, 2°) are approximately an order of magnitude lower than the Ka of calcium reported for the hydroxamate incorporation reaction and the Kd values derived from calcium-induced conformational changes in the enzyme protein. The Ka of calcium in the esterolysis reaction shows a marked decrease as the pH is increased with an apparent pK at 6.4, while the Kd for this cation, as measured by ultraviolet difference spectrophotometry, is independent of pH over the range studied. The calcium ion level required for reactivity of an essential —SH group of transglutaminase was found to be in the range of the Ka of calcium in the esterase reaction and the K'd for the calcium-enzyme complex as measured by equilibrium dialysis. Re-examination of the hydroxamate incorporation reaction at pH 5.4 and at high substrate and low calcium ion levels revealed a dependence of maximum velocity on cation concentration and a nonlinear relationship between reciprocal velocity and reciprocal metal ion concentration. These observations support and extend a previous suggestion that transglutaminase functions in combination with divalent cation as a metal-enzyme complex. They also form the basis for a proposition that metal ion combines in two different positions on the enzyme, thus giving rise to three possible enzyme-metal complexes. A complex containing only 1 metal ion serves to catalyze the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate, whereas the complex in which cation is bound at both sites in the enzyme is essential for amine incorporation into the glutamine substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1543303570,"Whereas the fluorescence of proteins has been extensively investigated, in particular by Weber and co-workers, the phosphorescence has been little investigated. This paper reports studies of the phosphorescence of a representative group of proteins and aromatic amino acids. The previously discovered quenching of the fluorescence of tyrosine and tryptophan in acid and alkaline pH is accompanied by an enhancement of the phosphorescence. The quenching of tyrosine fluorescence in proteins at neutral pH and by formate ion at neutral pH is accompanied by a quenching of the phosphorescence. Interpretation of these phenomena depends on a series of assumptions concerning the excited states of tyrosine and tyrosinate ion, which are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. Basically, tyrosine and tyrosinate ion are assumed to have π, π* states at lower energies than n, π* states. In tyrosinate ion the 3n, π* state is assumed to lie below the first excited singlet π, π* state. This facilitates singlet to triplet conversion (intersystem crossing) and accounts for the quenching of the fluorescence and the enhancement of the phosphorescence of tyrosinate ion as compared to tyrosine. An even more speculative assumption concerning the 3n, π* state is made to explain the fact that in tyrosine hydrogen-bonded to bases both the fluorescence and phosphorescence are quenched. In the heme proteins myoglobin and hemoglobin, neither fluorescence nor phosphorescence is seen at neutral or alkaline pH. When the heme is separated, the residual protein exhibits normal emission. In neutral solution the emission is quenched by energy transfer from the excited singlet states of tyrosine and tryptophan to the excited states of the heme. In alkaline solution, on the other hand, reasons are given for believing that the transfer is either from the excited triplet or from singlet states of the acids to the excited singlets of the heme."
https://openalex.org/W1486673642,"Abstract Accumulation of tricarboxylic acids related to lysine biosynthesis has been demonstrated in a yeast mutant, Ly12, which requires lysine as a growth factor in synthetic medium but can substitute α-aminoadipic acid for the nutritional requirement of lysine. Both radioactive and nonradioactive intermediates have been isolated from the growth medium under appropriate conditions and have been identified chromatographically, chemically, and spectroscopically as homocitric, cis-homoaconitic, and homoisocitric acids. Homocitric acid is in equilibrium as the free acid and lactone following treatment with formic acid. These intermediates in the lysine pathway are not accumulated in the wild-type yeast. The mutant Ly12 does not accumulate α-ketoadipic acid, indicating that the biochemical block in this mutant corresponds to the biosynthetic step preceding α-ketoadipic acid. Accumulation of these tricarboxylic acids in the culture medium of a lysine auxotroph provides additional evidence in support of their obligate intermediary role in lysine biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1521611096,"Abstract When the enzymic conversion of 3-deoxy-2-oxo-l-arabonate to 2,5-dioxovalerate is carried out in HTO or D2O, isotopic hydrogen is incorporated at C-3 and C-4 of the product. In D2O, 1 deuterium atom is incorporated stereospecifically at each position. Treatment of the enzyme with NaBH4 in the presence of substrate leads to inactivation of the enzyme and to covalent binding of 1 mole of substrate to 1 mole of enzyme. It was therefore concluded that the substrate and enzyme interact to form a Schiff base. A mechanism for the over-all reaction is proposed in which the enzyme-substrate Schiff base participates and which accounts for the observed isotope incorporation."
https://openalex.org/W1546502103,"Abstract Methods for the preparation of guanosine triphosphate-γ-32P, 3H-coenzyme A, and 14C-succinyl-3H-CoA are described. Various forms of succinic thiokinase from pig heart are prepared and isolated. They include the phosphorylated enzyme, the enzyme-bound CoA, and the enzyme-bound succinyl-CoA. From the amounts of those substrates bound to the enzyme, it is concluded that a molecule of the enzyme has at least two, and probably four, binding sites (presumably also catalytic centers). The enzyme catalyzes the 14C-GDP exchange with GTP requiring Mg++, 32P-inorganic phosphate exchange with GTP requiring Mg++ and CoA, and the exchanges of 14C-succinate and 3H-CoA with succinyl-CoA in the presence of Mg++ ions. These isotope exchanges and the occurrence of various intermediates are in general agreement with the previously suggested reaction mechanism consisting of three partial reactions and two high energy forms of the enzyme, succinic thiokinase ∼ P and succinic thiokinase ∼ CoA. However, a number of considerations are presented which must be clarified further before a definitive conclusion is reached. Incidental to the succinic thiokinase work, the occurrence of a phosphorylated intermediate of nucleoside diphosphokinase from pig heart has been found."
https://openalex.org/W1551105161,"Studies on the biosynthesis of the 7-deazaadenine base of the antibiotic, tubercidin, in growing cultures of Streptomyces tubercidicus are described. Isotope incorporation patterns suggest that the pyrimido moiety of a purine serves as the precursor of the pyrimido portion of 7-deazaadenine and that carbon atoms 1 and 2 of ribose may be incorporated into the pyrrole moiety of 7-deazaadenine. These conclusions are based on the following experimental observations. Carbon atom 8 of adenine-8-14C is metabolized to 14CO2 during the biosynthesis of tubercidin. 14C from adenine-2-14C, but not adenine-8-14C, is incorporated into 7-deazaadenine. The extents of incorporation of glycine and formate into cellular adenine and 7-deazaadenine are similar. The addition of adenine to cultures of S. tubercidicus inhibits the incorporation of 14C from glycine-1-14C into both cellular adenine and 7-deazaadenine. Ribose-1-14C is incorporated into the 7-deazaadenine ring. The amide nitrogen of the glutamine and the amino nitrogen of aspartic acid are incorporated into 7-deazaadenine. The implications of these findings with respect to the biological transformation of purines to 7-deazaadenine are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2079163040,"The administration to rats of the ethyl analog of methionine, ethionine, results in the rapid decrease in the hepatic concentration of adenosine triphosphate followed by an extensive disaggregation of polysomes to ribosome monomers and a concomitant inhibition of protein synthesis. These effects are readily reversed by the injection of methionine or precursors of adenine nucleotides such as adenine. The reformation of liver polyribosomes in such animals following the administration of adenine plus methionine was found to occur under conditions in which new RNA synthesis was markedly inhibited. Free messenger RNA without attached ribosomes must be capable of remaining functionally active in the liver cytoplasm for many hours."
https://openalex.org/W1479969474,"Abstract Uptakes by embryonic chick bone of various neutral amino acids and the effects on these uptakes of low temperature, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and competing amino acids were measured. At 38°, diffusible radioactivity gradients of more than 1.0 between total tissue water and incubation medium were established for each of 15 amino acids tested. At 4°, by contrast, entry of amino acids into the intracellular fraction was slow and did not proceed against a concentration gradient. Amino acid accumulation was completely inhibited by NEM. This inhibition was not immediate, however, and, during the first ½ hour of exposure to NEM, amino acid gradients were developed. Thereafter, net efflux occurred until, in some experiments, virtually all of the free amino acid had been expelled from the cells. If the bones in the presence of NEM were incubated at 4° after the first 30 min at 38°, net efflux did not occur; instead, the 30-min gradients were retained unchanged for at least 2½ hours. It was concluded that the NEM-treated tissue is capable of driving amino acid efflux by a metabolically dependent process despite inhibition of influx capacity. In this respect, inhibition by NEM differs from inhibition by actinomycin D, puromycin, or chilling. Evidence is presented for the existence of at least two sites for the transport of neutral amino acids by embryonic bones. The sites appear to be analogous to the alanine-preferring (A) and leucine-preferring (L) sites described by Christensen and colleagues. The A site specificity, as indicated by sensitivity to inhibition by alanine, is especially high for proline and α-aminoisobutyric acid. l site dependence is most notable for isoleucine, and in this tissue is defined more clearly by sensitivity to tryptophan than by sensitivity to leucine. Leucine has mixed A and L site affinities, as do most of the other amino acids tested."
https://openalex.org/W1988467679,"At pressures up to 125 atmospheres, helium failed to anesthetize mice; at slightly higher pressures (135 to 145 atmospheres) it proved lethal. With Italian newts (Triturus italicus), whose sensitivity to anesthesia by nitrogen is similar to that of mice, responsiveness was lost at pressures between 165 and 245 atmospheres, whether the pressure was achieved with helium or neon, or hydrostatically. It was concluded that the anesthetic pressures of helium and neon, for mice and newts, are higher than the tolerable mechanical pressures."
https://openalex.org/W1564045972,"Abstract The effects of myo-inositol deficiency on amino acid transport and accumulation by KB cells were studied with the aid of 14C-labeled serine, glycine, and α-aminoisobutyric acid. Kinetic studies of influx of these amino acids showed that inositol deficiency decreases the initial influx rate and the Vmax of all three amino acids. The magnitude of this decrease depends on the severity of inositol deficiency. The steady state accumulation levels of these amino acids established after influx were significantly reduced in deficient cells. Similarly the steady state distribution ratios of α-aminoisobutyric acid, established after influx or following efflux from previously loaded cells, were decreased in inositol-deficient cells, the magnitude of this decrease becoming larger as deficiency progressed. The relative efflux rate of α-aminoisobutyric acid from previously loaded cells was the same in both normal and deficient cells, and it was directly proportional to the initial intracellular concentration of α-aminoisobutyric acid. Inositol-deficient cells were unable to increase the steady state accumulation levels of α-aminoisobutyric acid to the same extend as normal cells, in response to increasing concentrations of extracellular Na+. No differences were observed between normal and deficient cells in their ability to accumulate α-aminoisobutyric acid at different concentrations of extracellular K+ or Ca++. It is concluded that inositol deficiency impairs the mechanism responsible for the uptake and accumulation of amino acids by KB cells."

https://openalex.org/W2095370377,"Although acoustic communication is not pronounced in reptiles, analysis of single auditory neurons in the medulla oblongata shows that the cochlea is a frequency analyser. Auditory neurons of the lizard Coleonyx variegatus respond to acoustic stimuli over a range of less than 0.1 to 17 kilohertz and are maximally responsive between 0.8 and 2.0 kilohertz. The frequencies to which they are most sensitive differ from neuron to neuron, ranging from 0.11 to 4 kilohertz. Some neurons have an inhibitory area which greatly overlaps the response area, so that inhibitory areas do not seem to sharply tune the response area at this level of the auditory tract. The inhibitory area is responsible for producing in some neurons a phasic response and nonmonotonic relation between sound intensity and number of impulses. The response pattern shows a tendency to change from tonic to phasic in more advanced auditory centers. This may serve to code rapid changes in the acoustic stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1929218648,"Abstract Dihydrosphingosine-4,5-3H was synthesized via the catalytic tritiation of N-carbobenzoxysphingosine. The tritium activities on carbon atoms 4 and 5 were 47 and 37%, respectively; the remainder of 16% on carbon atoms 6 to 18 was due to double bond migration, or carbon-bonded hydrogen exchange, or both. Radiochemical impurities of high specific activity were formed during the synthesis and were detected with iodine vapor after thin layer chromatography. They did not act as a substrate for phytosphingosine biosynthesis. From the ratio of isotope in substrate and product, it was concluded that dihydrosphingosine-4,5-3H was utilized intact in the formation of phytosphingosine. N-Acetyldihydrosphingosine-4,5-3H, N-acetyl-1-14C-dihydrosphingosine-4,5-3H, and triacetyldihydrosphingosine-4,5-3H did not serve as substrates for the synthesis of phytosphingosine. It was suggested that this was due to the low solubility of these compounds rather than to the absence of the appropriate enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1962851447,"Abstract At moderate concentrations the methyl, ethyl, or butyl esters of 10 amino acids inhibit the growth of Astasia. At least 8 of these also inhibit the growth of Euglena, although Euglena is generally less sensitive to these esters than Astasia. None of the amino acids tested at comparable concentrations inhibit growth except cysteine. The concentrations of ester required for 50% inhibition of growth rate depend not only on the amino acid, but on the ester group, increasing inhibition being generally observed with increasing size of the alcohol moiety. Recovery takes place primarily by nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the ester. Inhibition is highly pH-sensitive, with little inhibition below pH 5 and maximal inhibition above pH 6. Experiments with 14C-leucine ethyl ester indicate that Astasia is much less permeable to this ester at low pH. These observations led to the hypothesis that the amino acid esters inhibited growth by interfering with the corresponding aminoacyl transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) synthetases. Consistent with this hypothesis were the observations that: (a) phenylalanine ethyl ester inhibited the synthesis of an induced acid phosphatase; (b) the methyl and ethyl esters of serine, which did not inhibit growth, did not inhibit a partially purified seryl-tRNA synthetase of Astasia; (c) the methyl and ethyl esters of leucine, which inhibited growth, competitively inhibited the partially purified leucyl-tRNA synthetase of Astasia. Other growth experiments demonstrated that, whereas leucine slightly protected against growth inhibition by leucine ethyl ester, phenylalanine potentiated growth inhibition due to phenylalanine ethyl ester. It was then found that partially purified phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase is inhibited by excess substrate concentrations. It is suggested that some amino acid esters may be useful inhibitors of the first committed steps of protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1515034180,"Abstract Acetoacetic decarboxylase (acetoacetate carboxy lyase, EC 4.1.1.4), as extracted from acetone-powdered Clostridium acetobutylicum, contains some enzyme which is expressed and an equal amount which is latent and which may be measured only after its exposure by heating. Activation of the latent decarboxylase is an effectively irreversible, time- and temperature-dependent process which is kinetically first order. ΔHa for this activation is 25 kcal per mole. The expressed decarboxylase can be irreversibly inhibited by treatment with borohydride plus acetoacetate or 2-oxopropane sulfonate, without affecting the latent decarboxylase. The latent decarboxylase and the expressed decarboxylase sediment identically in a sucrose density gradient and are not separated by the procedures employed in the purification of the enzyme. The initially expressed decarboxylase and that which is exposed by heating, exhibit the same Km for acetoacetate and Ki for 2-oxopropane sulfonate. Monovalent anions protect against the irreversible inhibition of the enzyme by substrate plus BH4- but have no effect on the activation of the latent decarboxylase or on the thermal stability of the enzyme. Acetylacetone is similarly without effect on the process of heat activation but strikingly enhances the heat stability of the decarboxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1571303618,"Previous studies have indicated that nonheme iron may function as an electron carrier in the succinate oxidase pathway of Mycobacterium phlei. The nature and distribution of this component in the bacterium were investigated. A modified method for the quantitative determination of nonheme iron in mammalian and bacterial electron transport systems was developed. The bacterial electron transport particles accounted for only one-fifth of the total protein but were found to contain half of the total iron. In keeping with their electron transport function, the particles contained 89% of the heme iron of the extract. Nonheme iron was released in the ferrous state from particulate and supernatant fractions following boiling with trichloracetic acid. The release of iron from the particulate protein was found to be inhibited by mercurials. This inhibitory action of mercurials was reversed by mercaptoethanol or cysteine. In contrast, mercurials did not inhibit the release of iron from the supernatant protein, but the iron was released in the ferric state. A relation between sulfhydryl groups and iron content was indicated by the action of mercurials. The labile sulfide and flavin adenine dinucleotide content of the bacterial preparations was lower than the content of nonheme iron."
https://openalex.org/W1575980461,"Abstract This paper shows that reproducible proton magnetic resonance spectra of a low molecular protein, insulin, and of medium sized polypeptides (insulin A and B chains) can be recorded and interpreted consistently in terms of proton resonances from chemically different hydrogen atoms. For example, porcine and bovine insulin proton magnetic resonance spectra differ. The experimental procedure adopted has been to accumulate 100 to 400 single spectra from a standard Varian A-60 spectrometer on a computer, C-1024, thus improving the otherwise prohibitive signal to noise ratio. The denaturing agent, CF3COOH, was used as solvent in order to minimize the line broadening from which spectra of aqueous solutions suffer. This strong acid reacts with insulin as shown by fluorine resonance experiments, but slowly enough to permit conclusive experiments within 3 to 4 hours at 27°. The occurrence of spin-split signals from methyl and phenyl group protons and an estimate of the total signal response from the insulin protons indicate high intramolecular mobility for insulin dissolved in CF3COOH."
https://openalex.org/W1503001591,"Abstract The effect of myo-inositol deficiency on the ability of KB cells to synthesize de novo nucleotides and nucleic acids was studied with the aid of 1-14C-serine and 2-14C-glycine. Cells grown for 2 or 3 days without inositol showed a greater rate of incorporation of glycine into purine nucleotides than normal cells, when incubated with 1.7 mm 14C-serine or 14C-glycine. Similar results were obtained when the rates of incorporation of radioactivity into nucleic acids and proteins were measured as a function of inositol deficiency. The level of serine hydroxymethylase activity, the size of the intracellular glycine pool, and the rate of interconversion of serine and glycine were not affected by the deficiency. When incubated with 2-14C-glycine or 1-14C-serine inositol-deficient cells were unable to concentrate these amino acids to the same extent as normal cells. It is concluded that inositol deficiency impairs the ability of KB cells to maintain normal concentration gradients of glycine and serine across the cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1592108356,"Abstract Rabbit antibodies to 1-α-dinitrophenylaminoribonuclease, 41-e-dinitrophenylamino-RNase, RNase A, and their oxidized derivatives have been prepared. Only 1-α-dinitrophenylamino-RNase gives an appreciable decrease in precipitin and complement fixation reactions when compared with the appropriate unlabeled form. The two antisera to 41-e-dinitrophenylamino-RNase had no antibody to the dinitrophenyl group as judged by cross-reaction and hapten inhibition, and little antibody as estimated by precipitation with dinitrophenylated bovine γ-globulin. All other dinitrophenylated RNase derivatives elicited considerable antibody to the dinitrophenyl group. Perhaps the dinitrophenyl group on lysine 41 is folded into the interior. The binding constants are heterogeneous for the interaction between α-14C-dinitrophenyllysine and antibody to oxidized 41-e-dinitrophenylamino-RNase. Although both monomeric and dimeric RNase precipitate equal amounts of antibody when the reaction is carried out in small volumes, 1.5 to 2 times as much antigen on a nitrogen basis is required to reach equivalence when dimer is used. In precipitin studies with 41-e-14C-dinitrophenylamino-RNase monomer and dimer, the ratio of antibody to antigen was 2.00 ± 0.06 with monomer and varied from 1.71 in antibody excess to 1.28 in antigen excess with dimer. Certain antigenic sites are less reactive or decreased in concentration in the dimer."
