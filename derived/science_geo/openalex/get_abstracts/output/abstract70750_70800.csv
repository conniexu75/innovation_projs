https://openalex.org/W1582996069,"Glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cyclic AMP stimulated gluconeogenesis from lactate in perfused livers from fasted and fed rats. The stimulation was most marked when these agents were added to livers from fasted rats in which gluconeogenesis had become partially inactive during a preliminary perfusion without substrate. It is suggested that inactivation is consequent to the degradation of endogenous glucagon and catecholamines. Inactivation could be prevented by high levels of lactate. On a molar basis, glucagon was about 100-fold more effective in stimulating gluconeogenesis than the catecholamines, and 100,000 times more effective than exogenous cyclic AMP. Gluconeogenesis was as sensitive as glycogenolysis to stimulation by any of the agents and was as rapidly activated. It is proposed that cyclic AMP mediates the action of glucagon and catecholamines on gluconeogenesis. Glucagon stimulated gluconeogenesis from lactate and pyruvate but not from dihydroxyacetone or fructose, suggesting a point of action in the gluconeogenic pathway between pyruvate and triose phosphate. The maximum rate of gluconeogenesis from oxalacetate was about the same as that from pyruvate. Because lactate production from oxalacetate was substantial and the same tissue level of malate was found with pyruvate or oxalacetate, it appeared that oxalacetate was not metabolized as such by the liver but only after breakdown to pyruvate. Ethanol stimulated gluconeogenesis and lactate formation from pyruvate. The effects of ethanol and glucagon were additive indicating that glucagon does not act by increasing NADH supply. The gluconeogenic effect of glucagon was observed with concentrations of lactate in the physiological range. It is proposed that glucagon plays a physiological role in the maintenance of the blood glucose through control of gluconeogenesis as well as glycogenolysis in the liver. Sympathetic nervous activity, leading to the intrahepatic release of catecholamine, may also play an important role in increasing glucose output and lactate uptake by the liver, particularly during exercise or hypoglycemia."

Weight, water content, glycogen, and RNA increased in uteri and oviducts of rats, chickens, and quail receiving o,p′-DDT; p,p′-DDT produced little if any response. The o,p′-DDT did not accumulate in the reproductive or adipose tissues to a greater extent than p,p′-DDT."
https://openalex.org/W1546967274,"Abstract During incubation in vitro, uterine tissue readily converts the nonutilizable sugar, 2-deoxyglucose-1-14C, to 2-deoxyglucose-6-P-14C. This process appears to be analogous to transport and phosphorylation of glucose and is a sensitive measure of the activity in the early steps of uterine sugar metabolism. Nonradioactive 2-deoxyglucose-1-14C and d-glucose show similar inhibition of 2-deoxyglucose-1-14C phosphorylation at equimolar concentrations, but 3-O-methylglucose does not inhibit this reaction. Conversion of 2-deoxyglucose-1-14C to 2-deoxyglucose-6-P-14C by uteri from rats treated for 1 hour with 5 µg of estradiol-17β showed a 135% increase above control values, and this conversion rate continues to increase with longer periods of hormone treatment. The results show that estradiol accelerates either the transport or phosphorylation steps in early uterine sugar metabolism. Kinetic analyses indicate that estradiol increases the tissue Vmax for 2-deoxyglucose-1-14C phosphorylation without changing the tissue Km. Cycloheximide injected 30 min prior to estradiol abolishes the effect of the hormone, implying that the development of this metabolic response is dependent on protein synthesis."

Longer exposures produce aftereffects which are visible 20 hours after stimulation. Thus, experience which pairs simple attributes (color and motion) of visual stimulation can result in a lasting modification of perception."

The mixture consisted of unsaturated 24-ethylcholesterols possessing Delta(7)-, Delta(5,7)-, and Delta(5)-bonds together with their Delta(22)-derivatives and a small amount of cholesterol. The major component was 24-ethyl-Delta(7)-cholestenol. Squalene and phytol were also evident."
https://openalex.org/W1566345246,"Abstract The factors effecting the reversible interconversion between the protomeric and polymeric forms of liver acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase were investigated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and electron microscopy. Certain anions (citrate, isocitrate, malonate, tricarballylate, sulfate, and Pi), acetyl-CoA, high protein concentration, and pH 6 to 7 promote aggregation of the protomer. Other factors, such as carboxylation of the enzyme to produce enzyme-CO2-, Cl-, and pH values greater than 7.5, cause dissociation of the polymeric form. Citrate and isocitrate, but not tricarballylate or Pi, are capable of promoting the transition of the carboxylated enzyme (enzyme-CO2-) to the polymeric state. Under the conditions for carboxylase assay or for measuring the rates of other carboxylase-catalyzed reactions, all of which involve enzyme-CO2- as intermediate, isocitrate and citrate promote aggregation of the carboxylase to its polymeric form and a 15- to 16-fold activation of catalysis; neither tricarballylate nor Pi has this effect. Binding experiments reveal that acetyl-CoA carboxylase has one tight binding site per protomer (mol wt 410,000) for citrate (Kd, 2 to 3 x 10-6 m) and another for acetyl-CoA (Kd, 4 x 10-6 m). Acetyl-CoA binding at the latter site is unaffected by the presence of citrate. Dissociation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS; 0.1%) gives rise to subunits with a sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) of 4.3 S. By equilibrium dialysis against 0.1% SDS-35S, the carboxylase was found to bind 0.57 g of the detergent per g of carboxylase protein. The subunit molecular weight, determined by sedimentation equilibrium corrected for detergent binding, was 114,000 and by electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (1% SDS), 110,000. The presence of nonidentical subunits is indicated by the fact that there is a single biotinyl prosthetic group and there are single binding sites for both citrate and acetyl-CoA on the 410,000 molecular weight protomer."

https://openalex.org/W1483928419,"Abstract The photo-oxidation of lysozyme (hen's egg white), sensitized by methylene blue in 84% acetic acid solution, causes the selective modification of the methionyl residues, which are converted to the sulfoxide. The photo-oxidized protein shows a drastically reduced enzymic activity. The data obtained by comparing the sensitivity to proteolytic enzymes, as well as the accessibility of disulfide bonds to reducing agents and the optical parameters, for the native and the photo-oxidized lysozyme, allow one to correlate the loss of catalytic efficiency attending photo-oxidation with a conformational change of the protein. The segments of the polypeptide chain containing some tryptophyl residues play a major role in such rearrangement. Chemical reduction of the photo-oxidized lysozyme by aqueous 2-mercaptoethanol results in the restoration of the primary and tertiary structure, characteristic of the native lysozyme. A high recovery of enzymic activity is also obtained."

These findings suggest an alternative to the hypothesis that the neural organization of hypothalamic drive systems is modified by experience."
https://openalex.org/W1491462592,Abstract Chloramphenicol does not inhibit protein synthesis in mitochondria and synaptosomes isolated from rat brain cortex. Acetoxycycloheximide markedly inhibits protein synthetic activity in both preparations. These responses are the inverse of those observed with liver mitochondria. The anomalous response of brain mitochondria cannot be accounted for by cytoplasmic ribosomal contamination. There is no evidence that synaptosomal protein synthesis is catalyzed by subcellular components other than mitochondria.

https://openalex.org/W1483009610,"Abstract The solubilization and partial purification of β-galactosidase and β-glucuronidase from rabbit brain, using 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-galactopyranoside and 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-glucuronide as substrates, were achieved through preparation of an acetone powder, extraction of the powder with buffer, fractionation with ammonium sulfate, ion-exchange chromatography, and Sephadex gel filtration. It is shown that there are two different β-galactosidases and two different β-glucuronidases in rabbit brain active toward the mentioned substrates. The major β-galactosidase was purified approximately 500-fold over the homogenate and the β-glucuronidase approximately 3,000-fold. The purified enzymes were free of β-glucosidase activity. The most highly purified preparations of the two β-galactosidases also hydrolyzed o- and p-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside, and lactose but did not catalyze the hydrolysis of galactosylgalactosylglucosyl-ceramide and galactosylglucosyl-ceramide. The estimated molecular weights of the two galactosidases were 81,000 and 103,000, and of the β-glucuronidase, 266,000. A micromethod for the measurement of β-galactosidase activity when using complex glycosphingolipid substrates is described."

https://openalex.org/W1491833442,"It has been shown that the acetamido methyl protons of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine undergo a chemical shift to higher fields in their proton magnetic resonance spectrum when the inhibitor is bound to lysozyme. The observed chemical shift in the presence of the enzyme is different for the agr- and s-anomeric forms of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranose indicating either a difference in the affinity of the anomeric forms for lysozyme or different magnetic environments for the methyl protons in their enzyme-bound state. That the agr- and s-anomeric forms of GlcAc bind to lysozyme in a competitive fashion was indicated by observing the proton magnetic resonance spectra in the presence of 2-acetamido-d3-2-deoxy-agr-d-glucopyranose. The methyl glycosides, methyl-agr-GlcAc and methyl-s-GlcAc, were also shown to bind competitively with both anomers of GlcAc. Quantitative analysis of the chemical shift data observed for the association of GlcAc with lysozyme was complicated by the mutarotation of GlcAc between its agr- and s-anomeric forms. However, in the case of the methyl glucosides, where the conformation of each anomer is frozen, it was possible to analyze the chemical shift data in a straightforward manner, and the dissociation constant as well as the chemical shift of the acetamido methyl protons of the enzyme-inhibitor complex was determined for both anomers. The results indicate that the two anomers of methyl-GlcAc bind to lysozyme with slightly different affinities but that the acetamido methyl groups of both anomers experience identical magnetic environments in the enzyme-inhibitor complex."

https://openalex.org/W1542528979,"Abstract A possible approach to the preparation of heavy atom-containing protein crystals through covalent attachment of a metal-chelating group to the protein is described. The reactions of lysozyme and guanidinated lysozyme with methyl picolinimidate are shown to introduce 6.6 to 7 and 1.1 to 1.3 picolinimidinyl groups, respectively, into the protein molecule by reaction of the reagent with the amino groups converting them to picolinamidine functions. Studies with model picolinamidines reported here and by others show that the picolinamidine group strongly chelates d orbital transition metal ions. Both of the derivatives of lysozyme can be induced to form large crystals under suitable conditions, and both possess considerable lytic activity."

https://openalex.org/W2064390895,"DEVAULT et al.1 have proposed that electron transfer through biological structures over distances of a few tens of Ångstroms occurs by tunnelling, the height of the energy barrier stipulated being 1 eV. Similarly, Wei2 has suggested that electron tunnelling through the nerve membrane is involved in producing the N-shaped current voltage characteristics observed in, for example, squid axons3 and other membranes4. The question of the relative probability of the electron going over instead of through the barrier—in other words, electron transfer by hopping—has, however, not yet been resolved."

Development of arterial constriction does not depend upon the development of bradycardia. During pacing, arterial constriction continues in the absence of bradycardia. Increases in heart rate to values greater than 120 beats per minute during a dive produce a progressive decrease in mean aortic pressure, which suggests that one major function of bradycardia is to reduce cardiac output, thus matching left ventricular output to the restricted vascular bed and decreased venous return associated with diving."
