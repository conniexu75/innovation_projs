https://openalex.org/W1964983631,Enantiomerically pure polyhydroxylated natural products are synthesized by using a reiterative two-carbon extension cycle consisting of four steps. The generality and efficiency of this methodology are demonstrated in the total synthesis of all eight L-hexoses.
https://openalex.org/W1990450210,"A dimeric hemoglobin was purified from nitrogen-fixing root nodules formed by association of Rhizobium with a nonleguminous plant, Parasponia. The oxygen dissociation rate constant is probably sufficiently high to allow Parasponia hemoglobin to function in a fashion similar to that of leghemoglobin, by oxygen buffering and transport during symbiotic nitrogen fixation. The identification of hemoglobin in a nonlegume raises important questions about the evolution of plant hemoglobin genes."
https://openalex.org/W1976814756,"Cellulose from plants having crassulacean acid metabolism was enriched in deuterium but not in oxygen-18 in relation to cellulose from C(3) and C(4) plants growing in the same area, indicating that the deuterium enrichment is due to isotopic fractionation during biochemical reactions rather than during evapotranspiration. Hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope ratios of cellulose from the plants in this restricted area showed more variability than that observed in samples collected across an entire continent. Biological factors appear to be as important as environmental factors in determining the isotope ratios of plant cellulose."
https://openalex.org/W1969903344,"4-Amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid is more toxic to many broad-leaved plants than 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid. It is comparable in absorption by foliage, in translocation, and in soil-leaching characteristics; in soil, however, it retains its activity for a longer time."
https://openalex.org/W2157038705,"Organic reefs and shore erosion record the intersection of sea level with islands. From this record it is possible to reconstruct the history of vertical movement of the islands and the adjacent deep sea floor, including midplate swells. As judged by coral thickness, islands with barrier reefs sink as though they were on thermally youthful crust regardless of the actual age. Reefless islands do not sink until truncated by erosion. Apparently, thermal subsidence is balanced by isostatic uplift in response to erosion. Barrier reefs prevent wave erosion of encircled volcanoes and capture products of stream erosion so that isostatic uplift is eliminated. Insular shelves widen initially at rates of 0.6 to 1.7 kilometers per million years; the rates decrease with time. Thus the subsidence of islands depends on the size of the is land and the presence of reefs, and it may not always be the same as that of the surrounding oceanic crust."
https://openalex.org/W2054910145,"A series of small cation molybdates, MgMoO(4), MnMoO(4), FeMoO(4), CoMoO(4), NiMoO(4), and ZnMoO(4) with the wolframite structure characteristic of the corresponding tungstates have been synthesized at high pressure and temperature. The high-pressure compounds revert to the ambient pressure modifications if heated in air at 600 degrees C."

https://openalex.org/W1993196514,"A swarm of honeybees will move up to 75 m (250 feet) without its queen but only for 3 to 8 minutes. The swarm is aware of the presence of its queen, but the queen does not lead the swarm from one location to another. Bees return to a queen which cannot follow the swarm in flight and in fact are capable of finding a queen ""lost along the way."" The source of the odoriferous substance(s) responsible for a swarm's detection of its queen appears to be glands in her head."
https://openalex.org/W2054166158,"A simple method has been developed for the cultivation of colonies of Cordylophora lacustris. The colonies, attached to microscope slides slanted in beakers, are grown in a culture solution containing five required ions. Artemia larvae are supplied as food. Increase in hydranth number is exponential with a doubling time of about 3 days."

The program's main weakness was failure to transmit attitudes and information relevant to teaching science, not only as a body of knowledge, but as a way of thinking."
https://openalex.org/W1979397742,"Cross-linking is a process of considerabie commercial as well as biological importance. It gives useful properties to a wide variety of polymers; some, such as rubber would be almost useless if it did not occur. The facilitate of cross-linking for commercnai purposes, however, usually entails the use of heat or certain additives, or both. The agents sometimes alter certain of the properties of these polymer disadvantageously. Radiation can bring about cross- linking without the use of heat or additives. In addition, it can do this in polymers in which it is difficult to bring about cross-linking by other means. Unfortunately, the G value for crosslinking, which is a measure of the process efficiency, is usually so low that relatively large radiation doses are needed. This makes the technique still economically unattractive. The use of certain types of additives sharply increases the G values in some instances, but these additives are in themselves relatively expensive. In addition, some of the materials in which cross-linking is produced by radiation seem to have poorer mechanical properties than equivalent materials in which it is produced chemically. Despite the production of a certain amount of polyethylene in which cross-linking has been brought about by radiation,more » realization of the commercial promise of this process seems to be far in the future. The large amount of work in this field has resulted in a better understanding of both polymers and radiation chemistry. (auth)« less"

The definite Arctic and North Atlantic affinities of the microfauna suggest a possible migration through the Bering-Chukchi seaway during the late Pleistocene."
https://openalex.org/W2048810699,"Two species of Pogonophora on the continental slope off southern New England are reported. Two species were found: Siboglinum ekmani Jägersten and Siboglinum sp., an undescribed species. The density of both species combined, at 366 m, was 30 per square meter and at 567 m depth, it was 25 per square meter. The dominant macrobenthic organisms with which they were associated were polychaete worms and foraminiferans."
https://openalex.org/W2093012219,"The herbicides N-(3-chloro-4-methyphenyl)-2-methylpentamamide (solan) and 1, 1'-dimethyl-4, 4'dipyridylium dichloride (paraquat) were less toxic to tomato plants when applied together than either one alone. However, the combination was more toxic to crabgrass and eggplant. This phenomenon may result from the interaction of the herbicides with photosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2085986858,The low-energy extranuclear electrons emitted by iodine-125 can be used for electron microscope autoradiography with results comparable to those obtained with tritium. Autoradiographs of tritium-labeled bacteria showed that 71 percent of all reacted grains localized on the cell. This figure was 86 percent when I(125)-labeled bacteria were used.
