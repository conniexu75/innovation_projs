https://openalex.org/W1534369246,"A partial sequence for α-lactalbumin, one of the two proteins of lactose synthetase, has been established. This sequence includes the exact position of all but 15 of the 123 residues in the molecule, and two of the four disulfide bonds. This partial structure shows that α-lactalbumin has a close structural similarity to hens egg white lysozyme. When the sequences of the two proteins are aligned, 40 residues in α-lactalbumin are identical with corresponding residues in lysozyme. An additional 27 residues at corresponding positions are chemically similar. From these observations it is concluded that the genes for α-lactalbumin and egg white lysozyme are derived from a common ancestor. It is proposed that an ancestral gene which controlled the sequence of a lysozyme-like enzyme duplicated, and the duplicate genes evolved independently giving rise to the genes for α-lactalbumin and the lysozymes."

Stereoscopic pictures of part of the map and a skeletal model are presented. Features of the structure include 15% helix, 15% hydrophobic core, and appreciable antiparallel-β chain pairing. The configuration of the main chain and assignment of —S—S bridges closely resembles the structure of Rnase-A of Kartha, Bello, and Harker (3) except where there is a chemical difference. The structure is also compatible with much of the relevant chemical literature."
https://openalex.org/W2069645886,"A mechanism of mammalian teratogenesis involving inhibition of embryotrophic nutrition is suggested and exemplified by the action of trypan blue on pregnant rats. There is evidence for the localization of trypan blue in heterolysosomes of the epithelium of the visceral yolk sac, and our experiments indicate that the dye is an inhibitor of a selection of hydrolytic enzymes present in lysosomal fractions from homogenates of rat visceral yolk sac. It seems likely that trypan blue inhibits the intracellular digestion of embryotroph by the visceral yolk-sac epithelium; the conceptus may therefore be deprived of essential nutrients at critical stages of development."
https://openalex.org/W2091863287,Interactions among female paper wasps of newly founded colonies suggest that dominance relations assign social (reproductive) roles to siblings in a way advantageous to both dominants and subordinates. In various social animals dominance relations may have been an important prerequisite for the evolution of a division of labor between reproductive and nonreproductive (or less reproductive) adults.
https://openalex.org/W2073718116,"The particular agricultural adaptation we have been considering is the ultimate determinant of the presence of malaria parasites in the intracellular environment of the human red blood cell. This change in the cellular environment is deleterious for normal individuals, but individuals with the sickle-cell gene are capable of changing their red-cell environment so that intense parasitism never develops. Normal individuals suffer higher mortality rates and lower fertility rates in a malarious environment than individuals with the sickle-cell trait do, so the latter contribute proportionately more people to succeeding generations."
https://openalex.org/W1594649928,"Abstract A particulate enzyme preparation, obtained from sheep submaxillary gland, catalyzed the transfer of N-acetyl-d-galactosamine from its uridine diphosphate derivative to certain protein acceptors. The proteins were prepared from sheep submaxillary mucin by enzymatic or chemical treatments that removed the disaccharide residues from the mucin. Only these proteins served as N-acetylgalactosamine acceptors. The N-acetylgalactosamine glycosidic bonds in the product were alkali-labile, suggesting that they were linked to the hydroxyamino acid residues. The high degree of specificity exhibited by the transferase indicates that it catalyzes the first step in the conversion of the protein to this type of glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W2083075266,"A strain of mycoplasma not previously described has been isolated from the chorion, decidua, and amnion of a patient who sustained a spontaneous abortion during the middle trimester. The fetal membranes exhibited an inflammatory reaction, but no evidence of other infectious agents, bacterial or viral, was noted. The T strain identified is not a classical mycoplasma; it differs in growth and nutritional requirements from the T strains previously characterized."
https://openalex.org/W2172126996,"The present study was undertaken to examine the mechanism of insulin action on gluconeogenesis in the rat. Conversion of pyruvate to glucose was estimated by measuring the radioactivity of the blood glucose and liver glycogen at short intervals, usually between 5 min and 1 hour, after injection of pyruvate-3-14C. In alloxan-diabetic rats insulin at high dosage markedly lowered incorporation of pyruvate-3-14C into blood glucose, but also stimulated its incorporation into liver glycogen. However, total incorporation into blood glucose and liver glycogen was decreased by insulin. When insulin was withdrawn from insulin-treated, alloxan-diabetic rats, the incorporation rose gradually over 3 days to the untreated diabetic level. Insulin lowered the incorporation of pyruvate-3-14C into blood glucose of fasted or fat-fed rats, and also lowered incorporation in liver glycogen. Octanoate injected intraperitoneally into normal, carbohydrate-fed rats markedly enhanced pyruvate-3-14C incorporation into blood glucose. This effect was accompanied by lowered liver glycogen and increased blood glucose levels, but was without effect on the incorporation of pyruvate-3-14C into liver glycogen. On the basis of present knowledge of insulin action, taken in conjunction with known effects of long chain acyl coenzyme A esters and acetyl-CoA on intermediary metabolic reactions in liver, these results suggest that the high hepatic gluconeogenesis of fasting and diabetes is promoted by high hepatic acyl-CoA levels, and that the prompt and marked suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis by insulin is due to its antilipolytic action on adipose tissue."

Poeciliopsis lucida, a bisexual species, provides sperm for these monosexual forms which I designate as Cx, Cy, and Cz. Form Cy is a triploid that when test-mated to males of various species produces all-female, triploid offspring devoid of paternal characters. Both Cx and Cz are diploid and express characteristics of both parents."
https://openalex.org/W2024120778,"Hemoglobin Gun Hill, a new variant of adult hemoglobin, was found in a Caucasian and one of his three daughters. The abnormal hemoglobin had only half of the expected number of heme groups. Five amino acid residues appeared to be missing from the β-globin chains. These residues occur in linear sequence in normal β-chains in a region involved in heme-globin binding. A deletion of five amino acids in the β-chains of hemoglobin Gun Hill is postulated. The most likely mechanism for the origin of such a hemoglobin variant would appear to be unequal crossing-over during meiosis."

Lesions were induced with goldthioglucose in mice in the ventromedial region, including the arcuate and ventromedial nuclei. With the Fink-Heimer stain for degenerating axons, fiber connections between these two areas were demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1559071746,"Abstract l-Alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase was isolated from human liver and purified 900-fold. Pyridoxal phosphate was required for catalytic activity and enhanced the stability of the enzyme during purification and storage. The enzyme underwent activation when heated for 10 min in 10 µm pyridoxal phosphate. Activation resulted in the formation of a nondialyzable pyridoxal phosphate complex with the enzyme. The enzyme catalyzed the transfer of the α-amino group of l-alanine to glyoxylate, forming glycine. This reaction was completely irreversible under all experimental conditions used. Serine, arginine, tryptophan, and hydroxypyruvate were less effective substrates. The Michaelis constants for alanine and pyridoxal phosphate were 1 x 10-3 m and 1 x 10-6 m, respectively. The constant for glyoxylate could not be determined. The contribution of the enzyme to glycine, glyoxylate, and oxalate metabolism is considered, and the possible involvement of this enzyme in primary hyperoxaluria or oxalosis is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1630599512,"Abstract The velocities of reaction of N-ethylmaleimide and iodoacetamide with the reactive sulfhydryl groups of human hemoglobin were measured in solvents of varying pH and ionic strength, and at different temperatures. These solvents were chosen to cover a wide range of variation in the equilibrium, α2β2 ⇄ 2αβ, where α2β2 denotes the hemoglobin tetramer and αβ the dimer. There was no difference between the reactivity of the —SH groups of liganded dimers and that of these groups in liganded tetramers. However, the —SH groups of deoxy-dimers were much more reactive than those of deoxy-tetramers. Furthermore, the velocity of alkylation of the —SH groups of the deoxy-dimers which are present in tetramers composed of one deoxy-dimer and one liganded dimer is intermediate between the velocity of alkylation of these groups in free deoxy-dimers and that of the alkylation of —SH groups of deoxy-tetramers. These results are interpreted as evidence for the existence of three conformational states for deoxygenated αβ units: that of the free dimer, that of the dimer in a deoxygenated tetramer, and that of the dimer in a hybrid tetramer (a tetramer composed of one deoxy-dimer and one liganded dimer)."
https://openalex.org/W1669190037,"Abstract Adenosine aminohydrolase from calf intestinal mucosa was found capable of hydrolyzing several chemically unrelated substituents on position 6 of purine ribonucleoside. Km values increased in the following order: methylamino, hydroxylamino, amino, bromo, ethylamino, iodo, and chloro. The order of the rate of hydrolysis was amino, hydroxylamino, chloro, bromo, iodo, methylamino, and ethylamino. An amino group on position 2 of 6-halogenated purine ribonucleosides activated hydrolysis of the halide on position 6. Other position 6 substitutions gave rise to competitive inhibitors or inert nucleosides. Adenine nucleosides substituted on position 9 were either substrates or completely inert. The enzyme does not appear to have specific requirements for the 2'- or 3'-hydroxyl groups of adenosine but exhibits a marked requirement for the 5'-hydroxyl group. Apparently, the requirements for enzymatic binding of nucleosides are different from the requirements for the catalytic reaction. A comparison of kinetic parameters for adenosine aminohydrolase from calf intestinal mucosa and Aspergillus oryzae points to a fundamental difference between the two enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2011360850,"Starch-gel electrophoresis patterns of malate dehydrogenase from human tissue indicate a new genetic polymorphism for the mitochondrial form of the enzyme. Studies of families showed simple Mendelian segregation rather than maternal inheritance, suggesting that not all mitochondrial proteins are coded by mitochondrial DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2061132028,"Homogenates of rat cerebral cortex contain material corresponding to prostaglandins E(1), E(2), F(1)alpha, and F(2)alpha which are concentrated mainly in the light microsomal and mitochondrial fractions. Only the former fraction exhibits significant ability to synthesize prostaglandins E(1) and F(1)alpha from bis-homo-gamma-linolenic acid. After subfractionation of the crude mitochondrial fraction, prostaglandin E and F material is found mainly in the cholinergic and noncholinergic nerve endings. We conclude that the nerve endings are a storage site, whereas the light microsomes are the site of synthesis."

There occurred a marked release of the exogenous amine and, to a lesser extent, its deaminated metabolites, which varied with the region of brain tested and was inhibited by lysergic acid diethylamide."
https://openalex.org/W1964708624,Illumination of euglenas grown in the dark induces the formation of chloroplasts characterized by the simultaneous appearance of chlorophyll and galactosyl diglycerides in a relatively fixed ratio. The fatty acyl chains of the galactosyl diglycerides are constructed so that they can provide a stable lock-and-key fit with the phytol chains of chlorophyll in such a way as to localize the porphyrin structures of chlorophyll and space them for efficient photoreception. Light-starved photobiotic euglenas show chloroplast shrinkage with a concurrent partial loss of galactosyl diglycerides.
https://openalex.org/W2076258965,"Evidence from determinations of crystal structure relating to the shortening of carbon-oxygen bonds in the anomeric position in pyranose sugars is presented. There is a high degree of probability that the C(1)-O(1) bond is shortened by about 0.04 A relative to the other C-O single-bond lengths, except in the case of an axially oriented glycosidic group where there is evidence of a distinction between the two ring C-O bonds."
https://openalex.org/W104767528,"The conventional activity of electrophoretically purified horseradish peroxidase toward guaiacol, pyrogallol, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, and benzidine is abolished by removal of the heme prosthetic group with a mixture of cold acetone and hydrogen chloride. The apoenzyme, though devoid of peroxidase activity, retains its activity as an indoleacetic acid oxidase when it is supplied with 10(-5) mole of manganous ion and 2,4-dachlorophenol per liter. This oxidase activity is cyanide-sensitive; azide also inhibits under specific conditions of both pH and cofactor concentration. Partial restoration of the peroxidase activity by recombination of apoprotein with heme produces no effect on the oxidase activity, except that cofactors are no longer absolutely required. Therefore, it appears that the activity of peroxidase as an indoleacetic acid oxidase need not directly involve the heme prosthetic group, or that manganous ions and dichlorophenol can substitute for the heme group in the reaction between indoleacetic acid and oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1554466894,"Abstract A 3-ketosucrose-forming enzyme was purified from a soluble fraction of a sonic extract prepared from the cells of Agrobacterium tumefaciens grown on a sucrose medium. With the purified enzyme, FAD was shown to be the prosthetic group and it was also proved that the enzyme is a dehydrogenase. d-Glucose and d-glucosides showed the highest affinity for the enzyme and were converted to their corresponding 3-keto sugars. From these findings, in this paper the name of d-glucoside 3-dehydrogenase was proposed as a trivial name for the 3-ketosucrose-forming enzyme. Other characteristic properties of d-glucoside 3-dehydrogenase were as follows: (a) the Km values for sucrose and d-glucose are 3.8 x 10-4 m, and 1.6 x 10-4 m, respectively; (b) the optimum pH is 6.0 to 6.7; (c) the presence of Ca++ ions at 10-3 m inhibits the reaction almost completely; and (d) at acidic pH values, such as 5.2, Atabrine (10-3 m) shows a striking acceleration effect. A close similarity of substrate specificity between the receptor site of the sucrose transport system and that of d-glucoside 3-dehydrogenase in A. tumefaciens was observed. The differences between these functional sites in their relation to sucrose are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2088706174,"The migration of sensitized human monocytic-phagocytic cells from lymph-node tissue-culture suspensions was regularly and specifically inhibited by purified protein derivative or histoplasmin. Moreover, when nonsensitive cells were incubated with an RNA extract from lymph nodes of donors sensitive to purified protein derivative, histoplasmin, or both, the migration of these cells was specifically inhibited by these antigens. Ribonuclease inactivated the RNA extract."
https://openalex.org/W1975463360,"A technique has been developed for effectively separating the direct inductive effect of a light signal from its effect on the phase of the rhythm of sensitivity to photoperiodic induction. With this technique it has been shown that a 75-minute pulse of light per day, when appropriately positioned with respect to the circadian activity cycle of the sparrow Passer domesticus, is sufficient to produce a response normally produced only by long days. The results cannot be interpreted in terms of a requirement of an absolute amount of either darkness or light and offer strong confirmation of Bünning's hypothesis concerning the mechanism of photoperiodic time measurement."
https://openalex.org/W1489599123,"Abstract Chain elongation and 2-hydroxylation pathways, which are specific for very long chain fatty acids (gC18), have been found in the yeast, Candida utilis. The chain elongation system acts specifically on fatty acids of chain length C20 to C24; there is no detectable elongation of C18 and only trace activity with C19. The product of the elongation enzyme or enzymes is C26 when C20, C22, or C24 is substrate and is a mixture of C25 and C27 when the substrates are C21 and C23. The 2-hydroxylation enzyme converts C26 acid, formed in situ by chain elongation, to 2-hydroxyhexacosanoic acid. The enzyme seems quite specific for the C26 chain length, although there may be some activity for chain lengths C24, C25, and C27. In addition to the chain elongation and 2-hydroxylation systems, a relatively nonspecific system for the oxidative decarboxylation of 2-hydroxy acids has been studied in C. utilis. All 2-hydroxy fatty acids tested (C18 through C26 containing an even number of carbons) were converted, in part, to the unsubstituted acid containing 1 carbon less than the substrate. Decarboxylation was most efficient with 2-OH-C18 and least with 2-OH-C26 acids. Another product arising from the decarboxylation reaction was the aldehyde containing 1 carbon less than the 2-hydroxy acid substrate. The aldehydes were detected in trace amounts with the shorter chain substrates but were major products from the decarboxylation of 2-OH-C24 and 2-OH-C26. Presumably, the aldehyde is an intermediate between the 2-hydroxy acid substrate and the unsubstituted fatty acid which results as the final product in the oxidative decarboxylation process."
https://openalex.org/W1532270203,"Abstract This paper presents a model for the reaction of hemoglobin with ligands on the basis of the evidence that the αβ dimer is the unit of structure and function in the molecule and that there are very strong interactions between the α and β chains in a dimer. Thus, for all practical purposes, it can be assumed that 2 molecules of ligand combine with the αβ dimer at one time. The model is developed to show that there are five types of molecules in solutions of partially saturated hemoglobin: nonliganded tetramers, α2β2; liganded tetramers, α2*β2*; hybrid molecules composed of one liganded and one nonliganded dimer, αβα*β*; liganded dimers, α*β*; and nonliganded dimers, αβ. The contribution of these various species of hemoglobin to the total solute concentration clearly depends on the values of the tetramer to dimer dissociation constants for the liganded, nonliganded, and hybrid tetramers. The existence of hybrid molecules of the type αβα*β* is a key event in the combination of hemoglobin with ligand, because the affinity for ligand of the nonliganded dimer in such a hybrid molecule is assumed to differ from that of a dimer in a nonliganded tetramer. The model is expressed in quantitative terms, and it is shown that the derived equations describe the experimentally obtained oxygen saturation curves. Furthermore, the persistence of a high value of the Hill interaction coefficient, n, in solutions which promote the dissociation of the hemoglobin tetramers, α2β2, into αβ dimers (the so-called paradox of strong salt solutions) is compatible with the model proposed, which in fact predicts that this state of affairs will occur."
https://openalex.org/W2419504025,"This paper presents the results of measurements of the osmotic pressure of solutions of mixed hemoglobins in solvents that promote a significant degree of dissociation of the α2β2 tetramers into αβ dimers. The observed number average molecular weights of these solutions are greater than those calculated for the sum of the separate components with the assumption that there is no interaction among the different hemoglobins. This result indicates that interactions among the different hemoglobin species in solution do, in fact, occur. The observed interactions are shown to result from the formation of hybrid molecules of the type, (αβ)j(αβ)k, in solutions of mixtures of the parent hemoglobins, (α2β2)j and (α2β2)k. Furthermore, this type of interaction (the formation of hybrid molecules) is stated in quantitative terms, which allow for the calculation of the constants for the dissociation of such hybrid molecules into dimers, provided that the number of pure species is not greater than 2. Values of the dissociation constants, calculated from the experimental data for mixtures of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin and for mixtures of cyanmethemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin, are found to be intermediate between the values for deoxyhemoglobin and those for the liganded hemoglobins. The existence of hybrid molecules of the type (αβ)j(αβ)k is discussed with regard to recent proposals for the mechanism of reaction of hemoglobin with ligands and to the mechanism of the tetramer to dimer dissociation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1605304232,"Abstract Phenylalanine hydroxylase from Pseudomonas species has been purified 20- to 30-fold by ammonium sulfate precipitation, heat treatment, and diethylaminoethyl Sephadex chromatography. Activation by mercuric, cadmium, cupric, and cuprous ions as well as by ferrous ions has been observed. Several characteristics of the enzyme, such as its affinity for oxygen, tetrahydropteridine, and substrate, and its heat stability, have been measured in the presence of different metal activators. The properties of the enzyme were found to be substantially unchanged by the use of different metal ions as activators. Activation by ferrous ion did not produce any change in the molecular weight of the enzyme as measured by sucrose density sedimentation. Comparison of this enzyme with rat liver phenylalanine hydroxylase showed that the enzymes differ in several aspects, most strikingly in their molecular weights."
https://openalex.org/W1514153421,"Abstract Sulfite reductase (EC 1.8.1.2) has been purified 190-fold from spinach leaves. The enzyme catalyzes the reduction of sulfite to sulfide, with the use of reduced methyl viologen. NADH and NADPH are not capable of replacing reduced methyl viologen. A stoichiometry of 6 molecules of reduced methyl viologen oxidized per molecule of sulfide formed has been found. The enzyme, following treatment with reduced methyl viologen, is sensitive to inhibition by p-chloromercuribenzoate and cyanide. Without treatment with reduced methyl viologen the enzyme is not sensitive to either compound. Inhibition is not relieved by thiol compounds. Sensitivity of the enzyme to p-chloromercuribenzoate is lost in the presence of sulfite, while cyanide sensitivity remains. These results suggest the occurrence of two catalytically active sites, a p-chloromercuribenzoate-sensitive, sulfite-protected site, and a cyanide-sensitive site. Nucleoside di- and triphosphates, irrespective of the kinds of base and sugar, stimulate reductase activity. Pyrophosphate gives the same stimulation as nucleoside diphosphates. This effect is observed in 2-(hydroxymethyl)-2-(N-glycine)-1,3-dihydroxypropane buffer, but not in phosphate buffer."
https://openalex.org/W1489084005,"Abstract Interactions of tetrahydrofolate synthetase with its substrates were examined by measuring the effects of the reaction components on the relaxation rate of the water protons caused by manganese. A small enhancement (1.5) of the relaxation rate was observed when the enzyme was added to a solution of MnCl2 (in 0.5 m KCl) and was attributed to the presence of multiple nonspecific binding sites for Mn2+. Upon the addition of ATP or ADP much larger enhancements, 6.3 and 13.4, respectively, were observed. This result indicates that the metal-nucleotide complex, and not the free nucleotide, is the substrate in the reaction. De-enhancement of the relaxation rate and inhibition of the initial velocity were observed when the ratio of ATP to Mn2+ became greater than 10, an indication of competition between MnATP and free ATP. Dissociation constants for enzyme-MnATP and enzyme-MnADP calculated from the magnetic resonance data agreed fairly well with the Km of ATP and Ki of ADP. The addition of dl-tetrahydrofolate or dl-10-formyltetrahydrofolate to solutions of enzyme-MnATP or enzyme-MnADP caused a 2- to 3-fold de-enhancement. The deenhancement is attributed to the formation of enzyme-Mn-nucleotide-tetrahydrofolate quaternary complexes. From a titration of the effect of dl-tetrahydrofolate on et of the ternary complexes, the dissociation constant of dl-tetrahydrofolate from the quaternary complex was found to be in good agreement with the Km value determined kinetically. It is proposed that the change in the enhancement of the proton relaxation rate, observed when tetrahydrofolate or its formyl derivative binds to the enzyme, results from a conformational change in the protein in the region of the Mn-nucleotide binding site which is essential for enzyme activity."

https://openalex.org/W46149425,"Abstract α-Crystallin, one of the major soluble lens proteins, is composed of approximately 50 subunits. Each subunit contains but one sulfhydryl group. However, owing to the packing arrangement of the subunits in the aggregate macromolecule, a large fraction of the sulfhydryl groups is inaccessible to p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (HMB) at neutral pH and 20°. The sulfhydryl groups are exposed by increasing temperature. Studies at different temperatures of the reactivity of the —SH groups toward HMB suggest that α-crystallin may exist in at least three different stable aggregate forms. At any temperature between 20 and 34°, 71% of the —SH groups of the α-crystallin preparations α1 from the periphery of the lens (α1P) and the α1 from the nucleus of the lens (α1N) react with HMB. When the number of HMB-reactive —SH groups in these fractions is plotted against temperatures between 34 and 50° a linear increase is obtained until, at 50°, all sulfhydryl groups are exposed. The α2 preparation from the periphery of the lens (α2P) has 54% of its sulfhydryl groups available to HMB in the 20–34° range. A linear increase with temperature in the number of HMB-reactive —SH groups can be observed to 70° at which point all —SH groups are exposed. Of the —SH groups of the α2 preparation from the nucleus of the lens (α2N) 46% react with HMB at 20° and a linear increase with temperature to 70° is observed. All of these reactions are reversible. Any of the aggregate forms described above can be reversibly transformed to the other conformations by alteration in pH or salt concentration, or by addition of low concentrations of urea. The effect of pH upon the availability of the —SH groups to HMB with increasing temperature suggests that an ionizable group with a pK of approximately 9.6 may be involved in the unmasking of the —SH groups of all the α preparations. If any of the α-crystallin macromolecular forms are reversibly deaggregated, the reaggregated material appears to be packed in the α2N form on the basis of its temperature-sulfhydryl group reactivity relationship. However, treatment with low concentrations of urea will cause re-establishment of the initial conformation. Studies with oxidized material indicate that only 35% of the —SH groups in the aggregate molecule can form disulfide bonds, although in the deaggregated state all of the —SH groups are capable of forming disulfides. At 25° few of the HMB-reactive —SH groups of α1N and α1P and none of the groups of α2P and α2N appear to form disulfide bonds. The data suggest that there are no exposed —SH groups on the outer surface of the α-crystallin macromolecules, and that the —SH groups are immobilized by the aggregate structure, so that most of them are incapable of forming disulfide groups."
https://openalex.org/W1602018923,"Abstract The rate at which zinc dissociates from the inactive zinc complex of phosphoglucomutase is measured under a variety of conditions. The zinc dissociation rate is reduced about 50-fold by bound substrate, whereas added histidine increases the dissociation rate in a concentration-dependent manner; however, neither substrate nor histidine appreciably alters zinc binding by the enzyme. Histidine and other ligands probably participate in metal transfer in a manner formally analogous to the participation of buffer components in hydrogen ion transfer, whereas the substrate effect appears to be steric in nature. Possible applications of these observations to the general problem of removing metal ions from proteins are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2046069989,"Resting membrane potential and total cell resistance of human meningioma cells in tissue culture have been measured with fine microelectrodes. Addition of either antiserum inactivated with heat or control serum from normal rabbits produced small depolarizations (2 to 4 millivolts) with no discernible ( 5 percent) change in resistance. Addition of antiserums with complement, however, produced larger depolarizations and decreases in resistance before any changes in cell morphology were visible with light microscopy; as cytoplasmic swelling progressed, membrane potential dropped close to zero, and resistance decreased five- to tenfold. The electrical recording technique may be useful in the study of sublethal as well as lethal damage to immune cells and, in particular, may permit temporal resolution of damaging events and repair mechanisms in a single cell."

No egg mortality during cultivation, nor any slowing of development could be detected in either experiment. It may be presumed that the mortality of mouse ova during the period before implantation has no essential effect on the resulting fertility. During cultivation of oviducts for 144 hours, there occurred in most blastocysts herniation of their walls resulting in a formation similar to the blastocyst, and a migration of a disorganized mass of cells, some of which resembled the giant trophoblastic cells. After transplantation of ova fertilized in vitro to recipients, in four cases there occurred nidation and subsequent normal development of the embryo."

Hypersensitive animals, as compared to controls, show no alteration in liver weight (as percentage of body weight), but they manifest a significant shortening of time for induction of anesthesia. Induced hypersensitivity to barbiturates is apparently not the result of alterations in the metabolism of these agents, but it may be related to enhanced susceptibility of the central nervous system to these drugs."

The phenomenon is doubly illusory because the higher of two objects has been presumed to appear more distant. The illusion is probably limited to small visual angles (about 2 degrees).

https://openalex.org/W1579346609,Abstract Three temperate coliphages were examined for their ability to direct the synthesis of a new deoxyribonuclease and a new DNA polymerase concomitant with phage development. No new nuclease or polymerase activity was detected in extracts of Escherichia coli C600 infected with the noninducible phages 186 and 299. The defective phage carried by E. coli 15 also failed to produce detectable amounts of new nuclease or polymerase activity after induction by thymine starvation.

https://openalex.org/W1527282049,"Abstract When rat liver mitochondria were incubated for 15 min at 37° and pH 7.4 in 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrochloride, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm inorganic orthophosphate, and 1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetate, the resulting loss of endogenous K+ was greatly increased by the addition of 2.5 to 10 mm ammonium sulfate or sodium sulfate to the incubation medium. The increased rate of K+ loss, which could be completely prevented by the addition of ATP, succinate, or glutamate to the medium, began 4 to 8 min after the start of incubation. Ammonium sulfate and sodium sulfate also increased the loss of K+ when the mitochondria were first suspended at 0° in a solution containing KCl before being added to the incubation medium. When KCl was added to the mitochondria after 15 min of incubation at 37°, both the passive uptake and the active uptake of K+ were not affected by the simultaneous addition of either 10 mm ammonium sulfate or sodium sulfate. However, when mitochondria were incubated for 15 min with ammonium sulfate before the addition of KCl, active uptake of K+ appeared to be abolished. In the absence of exogenous Pi, sodium sulfate inhibited the loss of endogenous K+, while ammonium sulfate still caused an increased K+ loss. In the absence of exogenous Mg++, both ammonium sulfate and sodium sulfate inhibited the loss of endogenous K+ whether or not Pi was present in the medium. Addition of sulfate ions to the incubation medium also increased the leakage from mitochondria of compounds showing an absorption maximum at 259 mµ."
