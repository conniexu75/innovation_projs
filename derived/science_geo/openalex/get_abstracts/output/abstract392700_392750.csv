Here, we profiled gene expression in 38 distinct purified populations of human hematopoietic cells and used probabilistic models of gene expression and analysis of cis-elements in gene promoters to decipher the general organization of their regulatory circuitry. We identified modules of highly coexpressed genes, some of which are restricted to a single lineage but most of which are expressed at variable levels across multiple lineages. We found densely interconnected cis-regulatory circuits and a large number of transcription factors that are differentially expressed across hematopoietic states. These findings suggest a more complex regulatory system for hematopoiesis than previously assumed.

More than 2 × 1011 hematopoietic cells from at least 11 lineages are produced daily in humans from a small pool of self-renewing adult stem cells (Quesenberry and Colvin, 2005Quesenberry P.J. Colvin G.A. Hematopoietic Stem Cells, Progenitor Cells, and Cytokines.in: Beutler E. Lichtman M.A. Coller B.S. Kipps T.J. Seligsohn U. Williams Hematology. McGraw-Hill, New York2005: 153-174Google Scholar). Production of each cell type is highly regulated and responsive to environmental stimuli. Mutations or aberrant expression of regulatory proteins cause both benign and malignant hematologic disorders. The hematopoietic system is also well suited for an analysis of the global architecture of the molecular circuits controlling human cellular differentiation. Hematopoietic stem cells, progenitor cells, and terminally differentiated cells can be isolated using flow cytometry. Moreover, many aspects of hematopoietic differentiation can be recapitulated in vitro. Finally, high-speed multiparameter flow cytometry and cDNA amplification procedures allow us to purify and profile gene expression from rare subpopulations (Ebert and Golub, 2004Ebert B.L. Golub T.R. Genomic approaches to hematologic malignancies.Blood. 2004; 104: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A dominant model of hematopoiesis posits that it is controlled by a hierarchy of a relatively small number of critical transcription factors (TFs) that are sequentially expressed, are largely restricted to a specific lineage, and can interact directly to mediate and reinforce cell fate decisions (Iwasaki and Akashi, 2007Iwasaki H. Akashi K. Hematopoietic developmental pathways: on cellular basis.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 6687-6696Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Genetically engineered mice have been used to map the maturation stage at which key TFs are essential (Orkin and Zon, 2008Orkin S.H. Zon L.I.

Recent genome-wide studies suggest a more complex architecture in regulatory circuits involving larger numbers of TFs that control different combinations of modules of coexpressed genes (Amit et al., 2009Amit I.

Complex circuits with a larger number of TFs than previously assumed, each with a major regulatory effect, are emerging from studies in immune cell types (Amit et al., 2009Amit I. Garber M.

Schwartz P.H. et al.Regulatory networks define phenotypic classes of human stem cell lines.Nature. 2008; 455: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and cell differentiation in invertebrates (Davidson, 2001Davidson E.H. Genomic Regulatory Systems: In Development and Evolution. Academic Press, Burlington, MA2001Google Scholar). These two views leave open several key questions in understanding the regulatory architecture of human hematopoiesis. (1) Are distinct hematopoietic cell states characterized mostly by induction of lineage-specific genes or by a unique combination of modules, wherein the distinct capacities of each cell type are largely determined through the reuse of modules? (2) Is hematopoiesis determined solely by a few master regulators, or does it involve a more complex network with a larger number of factors? (3) What are the regulatory mechanisms that maintain cell state in the hematopoietic system, and how do they change as cells differentiate? Here, we measured mRNA profiles in 38 prospectively purified cell populations, from hematopoietic stem cells, through multiple progenitor and intermediate maturation states, to 12 terminally differentiated cell types (Figure 1). We found distinct, tightly integrated, regulatory circuits in hematopoietic stem cells and differentiated cells, implicated dozens of new regulators in hematopoiesis, and demonstrated a substantial reuse of gene modules and their regulatory programs in distinct lineages. We validated our findings by experimentally determining the binding sites of four TFs in hematopoietic stem cells, by examining the expression of a set of 33 TFs in erythroid and myelomonocytic differentiation in vitro, and by investigating the function of 17 of these TFs using RNA interference. Our data provide strong evidence for the role of complex interconnected circuits in hematopoiesis and for “anticipatory binding” to the promoters of their target genes in hematopoietic stem cells. Our data set and analyses will serve as a comprehensive resource for the study of gene regulation in hematopoiesis and differentiation. We defined 38 distinct cell states based on cell surface marker expression, representing hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, terminally differentiated cells, and intermediate states (Figure 1 and Table S1 available online). For each state, we purified samples separately from four to seven independent donors by multiparameter flow cytometry (Experimental Procedures), yielding 211 samples. Cells from all stem and progenitor populations were purified from umbilical cord blood. Terminally differentiated lymphocyte populations were purified from peripheral blood, as terminal differentiation is completed in these cells upon exposure to antigens after birth (Table S1). In all cases, cells were harvested fresh and were processed and sorted immediately. We isolated mRNA from each cell type and measured expression profiles using Affymetrix microarrays (Experimental Procedures). The global transcriptional profiles are consistent with the established topology of hematopoietic differentiation. Replicate samples from a single state but different donors and samples from multiple states within a lineage are highly correlated with each other, and profiles from related lineages are also similar (Figure 2A ). Of note, hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) samples do not form a separate cluster but are highly similar to early progenitors in the megakaryocyte/erythrocytes lineage (MEGA/ERY), suggesting that their transcriptional state is largely maintained in some of the early progenitors. These findings are also apparent in a systematic unsupervised analysis using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) (Brunet et al., 2004Brunet J.-P. Tamayo P. Golub T.R. Mesirov J.P. Metagenes and molecular pattern discovery using matrix factorization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 4164-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar) (Figure S1A ) and hierarchical clustering (Figure S1B). We further validated our data set by confirming that previously published lineage-specific gene signatures are significantly enriched in the expected lineage compared to other lineages (FDR < 0.25; Figure S1C and Extended Experimental Procedures).Figure S1Clustering and Characterization of Transcriptional Profiles, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Clustering using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) (Brunet et al., 2004Brunet J.-P.

(D) Functional enrichment in lineage signatures. Shown are selected functional categories (rows) that are over represented in at least one of the signatures (columns). Filled entry indicates significant enrichment (FDR < 5%). See also Table S2. In a supervised analysis, we found that each of the five dominant states in our data set—HSPCs, differentiated erythroid cells, granulocytes/monocytes B cells, and T cells—is distinguished by a set of significantly differentially expressed genes specific to each lineage as compared to the others (Figure 2B and Table S2). Some of these genes are expressed more than 100-fold higher in one cell type (e.g., granzyme genes in certain T cell and NK cell populations, PROM1 [CD133 antigen], and HOXA9 in stem and progenitor cells). The signature genes are enriched for molecular functions and biological processes consistent with the functional differences between lineages (Figure S1D and Table S2). Of note, a set of 16 genes comprised of the 5′ partners of known translocations in leukemias (Mitelman et al., 2010Mitelman, F., Johansson, B., and Mertens, F. (2010). Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations and Gene Fusions in Cancer (http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Chromosomes/Mitelman).Google Scholar) is enriched in the HSPC population (p < 0.013). This suggests that the 5′ partners of leukemia-causing translocations, containing the promoters of the fusion genes, tend to be selectively expressed in stem and progenitor cell populations. The diversity of gene expression across hematopoietic lineages is comparable to the diversity in gene expression observed across a host of human tissue types. The number of genes that are differentially expressed throughout our hematopoiesis data set (outlier analysis) (Tibshirani and Hastie, 2007Tibshirani R. Hastie T. Outlier sums for differential gene expression analysis.Biostatistics. 2007; 8: 2-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (Extended Experimental Procedures) is comparable to that determined for an atlas of 79 different human tissues (Su et al., 2004Su A.I.

To dissect the architecture of the gene expression program, we used the Module Networks (Segal et al., 2003Segal E. Shapira M. Regev A. Pe'er D. Botstein D. Koller D. Friedman N. Module networks: identifying regulatory modules and their condition-specific regulators from gene expression data.Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar) algorithm (Experimental Procedures) to find modules of strongly coexpressed genes and associate them with candidate regulatory programs that (computationally) predict their expression pattern. We identified 80 gene modules (Figure 3A ; modules are numbered arbitrarily by the algorithm) covering the 8968 genes that are expressed in the majority of the samples of at least one cell population. The genes in each of the modules are tightly coexpressed (Figure S2), and the 80 modules have largely distinct expression patterns (Figure 3A and Figure S2) and are enriched for genes with distinct biological functions (Figure 3B and Table S3).Figure S2Expression Pattern of 80 Gene Modules, Related to Figure 3Show full captionShown are the expression patterns of all the gene members in each of the 80 modules (rows) across all 211 samples (columns).

The samples are organized according to the differentiation tree topology (top); the modules' numbers are indicated by the left bar. Colors and normalization as in Figure 2B; abbreviations as in Figure 1. A small number of modules are expressed in very specific cell states and reflect the unique functional capacities of a single lineage. For example, module 889 is expressed in terminal erythroid differentiation and is enriched for genes encoding blood group antigens and organic cation transporters; module 691 is expressed in B lymphocytes and is enriched for genes encoding immunoglobulins and BCR-signaling pathway components; and module 721 is expressed in granulocytes and monocytes and includes genes encoding enzymes and cytokine receptors that are essential for inflammatory responses. Conversely, most modules are expressed at varying levels across multiple lineages, suggesting reuse of their genes in multiple hematopoietic contexts. These include modules expressed in both HSC and progenitor populations (e.g., numbers 865, 679, and 805), in both B and T cells (e.g., 673 and 703), in both granulocyte/monocyte populations and lymphocytes (e.g., 817, 799, and 649), and across all myeloid (e.g., 583) or all lymphoid cells (e.g., 931). Reuse of modules reflects the differential functional requirements for specific biochemical programs in the various cell states. For example, mitochondrial and oxidative phosphorylation modules (e.g., 847, 583, and 883) are induced in erythroid progenitors that produce high levels of heme and are affected most by mitochondrial mutations (Chen et al., 2009Chen M.L. Logan T.D. Hochberg M.L. Shelat S.G. Yu X. Wilding G.E. Tan W. Kujoth G.C. Prolla T.A.

To delineate the relation between gene expression and differentiation, we projected each module's expression pattern onto the known topology of the differentiation tree (Figure 4 and Figure S4). For example, consider module 865 (Figure 4A and Figure S3), which is strongly induced in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and contains genes encoding key HSPC cell surface markers (CD34 and CD117) and transcriptional regulators (GATA2, HOXA9, HOXA10, MEIS1, and N-MYC). By projecting the module on the differentiation tree, we observe that its induced state in HSCs persists through several consecutive differentiation steps and is repressed at three main points (Figure 4A, arrowheads): (1) after the granulocyte/monocyte progenitor, (2) after erythroid progenitors, and (3) in the differentiation of HSCs toward the lymphocyte lineage.Figure 4Propagation and Transitions in Modules' Expression along HematopoiesisShow full captionShown are the mean expression levels of the module's genes in each cell state (colored squares) and selected changes in the predicted regulators, as highlighted in the text (upward arrowhead, regulator induced; downward arrowhead, regulator repressed).

How Ca2+ channels are recruited to active zones, however, remains unknown. Using unbiased yeast two-hybrid screens, we here identify a direct interaction of the central PDZ domain of the active-zone protein RIM with the C termini of presynaptic N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels but not L-type Ca2+ channels. To test the physiological significance of this interaction, we generated conditional knockout mice lacking all multidomain RIM isoforms. Deletion of RIM proteins ablated most neurotransmitter release by simultaneously impairing the priming of synaptic vesicles and by decreasing the presynaptic localization of Ca2+ channels. Strikingly, rescue of the decreased Ca2+-channel localization required the RIM PDZ domain, whereas rescue of vesicle priming required the RIM N terminus. We propose that RIMs tether N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels to presynaptic active zones via a direct PDZ-domain-mediated interaction, thereby enabling fast, synchronous triggering of neurotransmitter release at a synapse.

Deletion of RIM proteins ablated most neurotransmitter release by simultaneously impairing the priming of synaptic vesicles and by decreasing the presynaptic localization of Ca2+ channels. Strikingly, rescue of the decreased Ca2+-channel localization required the RIM PDZ domain, whereas rescue of vesicle priming required the RIM N terminus. We propose that RIMs tether N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels to presynaptic active zones via a direct PDZ-domain-mediated interaction, thereby enabling fast, synchronous triggering of neurotransmitter release at a synapse. At presynaptic active zones, Ca2+ channels bind to PDZ domains of RIM proteins Deletion of RIM proteins decreases presynaptic Ca2+ influx and vesicle priming RIMs tether Ca2+ channels to presynaptic active zones for fast, synchronous release RIM PDZ but not C2 domains are essential for tethering presynaptic Ca2+ channels At a synapse, action potentials induce Ca2+ influx into a presynaptic terminal, which triggers rapid synchronous neurotransmitter release, thereby initiating synaptic transmission (Katz, 1969Katz B. The Release of Neural Transmitter Substances. Liverpool Univ. Press, Liverpool1969Google Scholar). Release is mediated by synaptic vesicle exocytosis at the active zone, a specialized region of the presynaptic plasma membrane that docks and primes vesicles for exocytosis (Wojcik and Brose, 2007Wojcik S.M. Brose N. Regulation of membrane fusion in synaptic excitation-secretion coupling: Speed and accuracy matter.Neuron. 2007; 55: 11-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Fast synchronous release requires colocalization of Ca2+ channels with the release machinery at the active zone (Llinas et al., 1992Llinas R. Sugimori M. Silver R.B.

Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels consist of a pore-forming α1 subunit and accessory β and α2δ subunits (Catterall et al., 2005Catterall W.A. Perez-Reyes E. Snutch T.P. Striessnig J.

Presynaptic neurotransmitter release almost exclusively depends on N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels containing CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 α1 subunits, respectively; R-type Ca2+ channels containing CaV2.3 α1 subunits may also contribute, whereas L-type and T-type Ca2+ channels containing CaV1 and CaV3 α1 subunits do not (Castillo et al., 1994Castillo P.E.

Active zones are composed of evolutionarily conserved proteins, including Munc13s, RIMs, RIM-BPs (RIM-binding proteins), ELKS's, and α-liprins (Wojcik and Brose, 2007Wojcik S.M. Brose N.

Of these proteins, RIMs are likely the central organizers because they directly or indirectly interact with all other known active-zone proteins and with synaptic vesicles (Mittelstaedt et al., 2010Mittelstaedt T. Alvarez-Baron E. Schoch S. RIM proteins and their role in synapse function.Biol. Chem. 2010; 391: 599-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Several presynaptic proteins were shown to interact with Ca2+ channels. However, none of the reported interactions is selective for N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels. For example, (1) the RIM C2A and C2B domains bind to α1 subunits of L- and N-type Ca2+ channels (Coppola et al., 2001Coppola T. Magnin-Luthi S. Perret-Menoud V. Gattesco S. Schiavo G. Regazzi R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32756-32762Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), (2) the RIM C2B domain interacts with the β4 Ca2+ channel subunit (Kiyonaka et al., 2007Kiyonaka S. Wakamori M. Miki T. Uriu Y. Nonaka M. Bito H. Beedle A.M. Mori E. Hara Y. De Waard M. et al.RIM1 confers sustained activity and neurotransmitter vesicle anchoring to presynaptic Ca2+ channels.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) that associates with all Ca2+ channels subtypes but is not required for neurotransmitter release (Qian and Noebels, 2000Qian J. Noebels J.L. Presynaptic Ca(2+) influx at a mouse central synapse with Ca(2+) channel subunit mutations.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 163-170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and (3) the proline-rich sequences of RIMs bind to RIM-BPs (Wang et al., 2000Wang Y. Sugita S. Sudhof T.C. The RIM/NIM family of neuronal C2 domain proteins. Interactions with Rab3 and a new class of Src homology 3 domain proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20033-20044Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) that in turn bind to L-, N-, and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels (Hibino et al., 2002Hibino H. Pironkova R. Onwumere O. Vologodskaia M. Hudspeth A.J. Lesage F. RIM binding proteins (RBPs) couple Rab3-interacting molecules (RIMs) to voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels.Neuron. 2002; 34: 411-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Thus, no plausible hypothesis at present suggests how N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels are selectively recruited to presynaptic active zones. More importantly, no presynaptic protein has been identified that is essential for recruiting N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels to presynaptic terminals. Only α-neurexins, which are presynaptic cell-adhesion molecules, were found to be required for presynaptic Ca2+-channel function (Missler et al., 2003Missler M. Zhang W. Rohlmann A. Kattenstroth G. Hammer R.E. Gottmann K. Sudhof T.C. Alpha-neurexins couple Ca2+ channels to synaptic vesicle exocytosis.Nature. 2003; 424: 939-948Crossref Scopus (475) Google Scholar). α-neurexins, however, are also essential for the organization of other components of the presynaptic release machinery, and no molecular mechanism is known that links α-neurexins to active zones or Ca2+ channels. Using an unbiased yeast two-hybrid screen, we here identify a direct interaction of P/Q- and N-type Ca2+ channels with RIM PDZ domains. To test whether RIMs act to localize Ca2+ channels to active zones, and whether this function requires the PDZ domains of RIMs, we generated conditional double knockout (KO) mice of all RIM isoforms that contain PDZ domains. Using these mice, we show by electrophysiological recordings, Ca2+ imaging, and quantitative immunostaining of Ca2+ channels that RIMs are essential for localizing Ca2+ channels to release sites. Moreover, we show that only two RIM sequences are required for localization of Ca2+ influx to active zones: their PDZ domains that bind to Ca2+ channels and their proline-rich sequences that bind to RIM-BPs, which in turn bind to Ca2+ channels. Thus, we propose that RIMs tether Ca2+ channels to active zones via two parallel essential interactions, direct binding of Ca2+ channels to the RIM PDZ domains that is specific for N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels and indirect binding of Ca2+ channels to RIMs via RIM-BPs that is shared among different types of Ca2+ channels. We performed yeast-two hybrid screens for proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic C-terminal sequences of P/Q- and N-type Ca2+ channels. We chose these Ca2+-channel baits because P/Q- and N-type Ca2+ channels mediate nearly all presynaptic Ca2+ influx, and their C termini have been implicated in targeting Ca2+ channels to the active zone (Catterall et al., 2005Catterall W.A. Perez-Reyes E. Snutch T.P. Striessnig J. International Union of Pharmacology. XLVIII. Nomenclature and structure-function relationships of voltage-gated calcium channels.Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 57: 411-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). The C termini of N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels contain three conserved sequence motifs (Figure 1A and Figure S1A available online): an SH3 domain-binding motif (RQLPGTP), a PNGY motif, and a C-terminal sequence motif (DxWC). Among 84 and 134 independent prey clones obtained in P/Q- and N-type Ca2+-channel screens, 33 and 16 prey clones, respectively, represented RIM-BPs (Figure 1B), consistent with earlier studies (Hibino et al., 2002Hibino H. Pironkova R. Onwumere O. Vologodskaia M. Hudspeth A.J. Lesage F.

In addition, 2 and 3 independent prey clones, respectively, contained RIM1 fragments, whose only overlapping sequence encoded the PDZ domain (Figure 1C).Figure S1Binding of RIM PDZ Domains to C-Terminal Ca2+-Channel Peptides Shown by NMR Spectroscopy and Isothermal Calorimetry, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Alignment of conserved sequence motifs in the C-terminal tails of α1 subunits of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.(B–D) 1H-15N HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled RIM1 (B, 40 μM; C, 35 μM) or RIM2 PDZ domains (D, 40 μM) in the absence (black contours) or presence (colored contours) of unlabeled peptides corresponding to the C-terminal sequences of ELKS1b (B; 100 μM peptide), N-type Ca2+ channel (C; 230 μM peptide, similar results were obtained with N-type Ca2+ channel peptides and the RIM2 PDZ domain, data not shown), or P/Q-type Ca2+ channel (D, 100 μM peptide).

When we used the RIM2 PDZ domain (data not shown), P/Q-type Ca2+-channel peptides bound with a Kd of 42 ± 12 μM (N = 1.09). The direct interaction of the RIM1 PDZ domain with P/Q- and N-type Ca2+ channels was unexpected, prompting us to quantify it using liquid yeast two-hybrid assays. We found that the RIM1 PDZ domain strongly and specifically bound to P/Q- and N-type Ca2+ channels, whereas no other RIM1 domain tested exhibited Ca2+-channel binding activity (Figures 1D–1F). Mutations in the three conserved motifs of the cytoplasmic sequences of N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels showed that only the C-terminal sequence motif was essential for binding to RIM1 PDZ domains, as predicted for a PDZ-domain interaction (Figures 1E and 1F). To validate the interaction of RIM PDZ domains with Ca2+ channels by an independent method, we employed NMR spectroscopy. We produced a recombinant 15N-labeled RIM1 PDZ domain and acquired 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra in the absence or presence of unlabeled peptide from the C terminus of the P/Q-type Ca2+ channel (residues RHDAYSESEDDWC). Previous studies of the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the RIM1 PDZ domain (Lu et al., 2005Lu J. Li H. Wang Y. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Solution structure of the RIM1alpha PDZ domain in complex with an ELKS1b C-terminal peptide.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 455-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) allowed us to assign cross-peak shifts induced by the Ca2+-channel peptide to specific residues in the RIM PDZ domain (see Extended Experimental Procedures, experimental rationale 1). We found that the C terminus of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels directly bound to the ligand-binding pocket of the RIM1 PDZ domain (Figures 1G and 1H and Figure S1B). Additional 1H-15N HSQC experiments revealed analogous binding of the C terminus of N-type Ca2+ channels to the RIM1 PDZ domain, and of Ca2+ channels to the RIM2 PDZ domain (Figures S1C and S1D). An atomic model suggests that the Ca2+-channel sequence fits well into the PDZ-domain-binding pocket (Figures 1H and 1I). The binding envisioned in this model agrees with the shifts we observed in the HSQC spectra in cross-peaks from residues such as K651, K653, and K694, which contribute to the binding pocket of the RIM1 PDZ domain and move upon P/Q-type Ca2+-channel peptide binding (Figure 1G). Furthermore, we confirmed these interactions by isothermal calorimetry with the RIM1 PDZ domain (Figures S1E and S1F), yielding dissociation constants similar to those of other PDZ-domain interactions (P/Q-type Ca2+ channel, 10.3 ± 0.6 μM; N-type Ca2+ channel, 23.4 ± 1.7 μM; Wiedemann et al., 2004Wiedemann U. Boisguerin P. Leben R. Leitner D. Krause G. Moelling K. Volkmer-Engert R. Oschkinat H. Quantification of PDZ domain specificity, prediction of ligand affinity and rational design of super-binding peptides.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 703-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, RIM PDZ domains stoichiometrically interact with the C-terminal sequences of N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, which are not found in L- and T-type Ca2+ channels. The binding of RIM PDZ domains to Ca2+ channels was unexpected because RIM PDZ domains interact with the active-zone protein ELKS (a.k.a., Rab6-binding protein, CAST, or ERC; Ohtsuka et al., 2002Ohtsuka T.

https://openalex.org/W2008202172,"Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is highly expressed in more than 70% of breast cancers and functions as an oncogene. However, an exact mechanism by which KLF4 enhances tumorigenesis of breast cancer remains unknown. In this study, we show that KLF4 was highly expressed in cancer stem cell (CSC)-enriched populations in mouse primary mammary tumor and breast cancer cell lines. Knockdown of KLF4 in breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) decreased the proportion of stem/progenitor cells as demonstrated by expression of stem cell surface markers such as aldehyde dehydrogenase 1, side population and by in vitro mammosphere assay. Consistently KLF4 overexpression led to an increase of the cancer stem cell population. KLF4 knockdown also suppressed cell migration and invasion in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, knockdown of KLF4 reduced colony formation in vitro and inhibited tumorigenesis in immunocompromised non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice, supporting an oncogenic role for KLF4 in breast cancer development. Further mechanistic studies revealed that the Notch signaling pathway was required for KLF4-mediated cell migration and invasion, but not for CSC maintenance. Taken together, our study provides evidence that KLF4 has a potent oncogenic role in mammary tumorigenesis likely by maintaining stem cell–like features and by promoting cell migration and invasion. Thus, targeting KLF4 may provide an effective therapeutic approach to suppress tumorigenicity in breast cancer."

Both clusters are repressed by Polycomb group (PcG) proteins. Here, we show that genes of the two Hox complexes can interact within nuclear PcG bodies in tissues where they are corepressed. This colocalization increases during development and depends on PcG proteins. Hox gene contacts are conserved in the distantly related Drosophila virilis species and they are part of a large gene interaction network that includes other PcG target genes. Importantly, mutations on one of the loci weaken silencing of genes in the other locus, resulting in the exacerbation of homeotic phenotypes in sensitized genetic backgrounds. Thus, the three-dimensional organization of Polycomb target genes in the cell nucleus stabilizes the maintenance of epigenetic gene silencing.

A subset of Polycomb target genes frequently colocalize within Drosophila nuclei Hox gene contacts depend on Polycomb proteins and are evolutionarily conserved Specific regulatory DNA elements affect Hox gene contacts Decrease of Hox gene contacts reduces silencing The organization of chromosomal domains in the cell nucleus plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression during cellular differentiation and development (Fraser and Bickmore, 2007Fraser P.

During interphase, eukaryotic chromosomes are organized as distinct domains called chromosome territories, which adopt specific structure and position in the cell nucleus. These territories are not strictly delimited in the nuclear space, allowing for some intermingling with other chromosomes (Branco and Pombo, 2006Branco M.R. Pombo A. Intermingling of chromosome territories in interphase suggests role in translocations and transcription-dependent associations.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e138Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). It has been reported that chromosomal elements separated by large genomic distances are sometimes able to interact in the nuclear space. The phenomenon of long-range contacts between different chromosomal loci has been called “chromosome kissing” (Cavalli, 2007Cavalli G. Chromosome kissing.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Chromosome kissing has been reported for X chromosome inactivation, where the two copies come transiently in close proximity at the onset of the inactivation process (Okamoto and Heard, 2009Okamoto I. Heard E. Lessons from comparative analysis of X-chromosome inactivation in mammals.Chromosome Res. 2009; 17: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The same phenomenon has been observed in few other situations. However, it is not clear how these contacts may contribute to gene regulation in living organisms (Sexton et al., 2009Sexton T.

In Drosophila melanogaster, Hox genes are the most prominent PcG targets. They are organized in two complexes: the Antennapedia complex (ANT-C) spans approximately 400 kb and comprises five Hox genes (lab, pb, Dfd, Scr, and Antp) that specify parts of the head and the anterior thorax (Kaufman et al., 1990Kaufman T.C. Seeger M.A. Olsen G. Molecular and genetic organization of the antennapedia gene complex of Drosophila melanogaster.Adv. Genet. 1990; 27: 309-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), while the bithorax complex (BX-C) spans approximately 350 kb and contains three Hox genes (Ubx, abd-A, and Abd-B) involved in the development of the posterior thorax and the abdomen (Duncan, 1987Duncan I. The bithorax complex.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1987; 21: 285-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, Lewis et al., 2003Lewis E.B. Pfeiffer B.D. Mathog D.R. Celniker S.E. Evolution of the homeobox complex in the Diptera.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R587-R588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The nuclear organization of the BX-C has been studied by Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) and Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) approaches (Lanzuolo et al., 2007Lanzuolo C. Roure V. Dekker J. Bantignies F. Orlando V. Polycomb response elements mediate the formation of chromosome higher-order structures in the bithorax complex.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This study revealed the existence of long-distance interactions among the major elements bound by PcG proteins, including PREs and core promoters. Importantly, upon activation of the Abd-B gene, its interactions with the other genes of the complex are lost. Two particular PRE-containing elements called Fab-7 and Mcp, both involved in the regulation of Abd-B, have been directly implicated in chromosome kissing events when extra copies were introduced in the fly genome as transgenes. In both cases, contacts strengthen PcG-dependent gene silencing and kissing events occur specifically at PcG bodies (Bantignies et al., 2003Bantignies F. Grimaud C. Lavrov S. Gabut M. Cavalli G.

Cell. 2006; 17: 2158-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), although they are clearly tissue-specific and do not occur in several larval tissues containing polytene chromosomes (Fedorova et al., 2008Fedorova E. Sadoni N. Dahlsveen I.K. Koch J. Kremmer E. Eick D. Paro R. Zink D. The nuclear organization of Polycomb/Trithorax group response elements in larval tissues of Drosophila melanogaster.Chromosome Res. 2008; 16: 649-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These data raise the question of whether PcG bodies might be involved in the functional compartmentalization of the Hox clusters or other Polycomb target genes. In D. melanogaster, the ANT-C and BX-C complexes are located on the right arm of chromosome 3 (3R), separated by approximately 10 Mb of euchromatic sequences that contain more than 1,200 annotated genes and represent more than one-third of the euchromatic fraction of 3R (Figure 1A ). In this work, we provide evidence that the two distant Hox clusters can be corepressed by PcG proteins via association in three-dimensional nuclear space between the Antennapedia (Antp) gene from the ANT-C and the Abdominal-B (Abd-B) and Ultrabithorax (Ubx) genes from the BX-C. We define this phenomenon as “Hox gene kissing.” Furthermore, 3C on chip (4C) confirmed Hox contacts and revealed additional Abd-B partner loci. Importantly, Hox gene kissing is conserved in D. virilis, a species evolutionarily separated from D. melanogaster by around 60 Myr. Moreover, we demonstrate that the BX-C element Fab-7 participates in Hox gene kissing, and that removal of this element weakens silencing of distant genes in the ANT-C locus, indicating that PcG-dependent chromatin contacts have a functional role in stabilizing gene silencing. We first analyzed the relative positioning of the two Hox complexes in the nucleus, starting with the most distal genes within each complex: Abd-B from the BX-C, and Antp from the ANT-C. We used two-color FISH in whole mount embryos and larval tissues, followed by three-dimensional image analysis (Bantignies et al., 2003Bantignies F. Grimaud C. Lavrov S. Gabut M. Cavalli G. Inheritance of Polycomb-dependent chromosomal interactions in Drosophila.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2406-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We compared embryonic and larval nuclei with different Hox gene expression profiles (Castelli-Gair, 1998Castelli-Gair J. Implications of the spatial and temporal regulation of Hox genes on development and evolution.Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 42: 437-444PubMed Google Scholar, Kosman et al., 2004Kosman D. Mizutani C.M.

Vinca alkaloids enhance the half-life of tumour ornithine decarboxylase.Cancer Lett. 1994; 81: 209-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We first focused on developmental stage 10–11, when PcG-mediated regulation of homeotic genes has already initiated (Pirrotta et al., 1995Pirrotta V. Chan C.S. McCabe D. Qian S. Distinct parasegmental and imaginal enhancers and the establishment of the expression pattern of the Ubx gene.Genetics. 1995; 141: 1439-1450PubMed Google Scholar). 3D image acquisitions were carried out in ectodermal interphase diploid nuclei in three different regions along the anteroposterior axis of the embryo: the head, where both genes are repressed, a thoracic region including parasegments (PS) 4 and 5, where Antp is expressed and Abd-B repressed, and the posterior tip of the embryo (PS 13 and 14), where the reciprocal situation is observed, i.e., Abd-B is activated and Antp repressed. Abd-B and the Antp gene rarely colocalized in the thoracic PS and in the posterior PS, with colocalization rates of 4% and 7.6%, respectively. In contrast, the association between the loci was significantly stronger in the head where both loci are repressed (18%, Figure 1B,C). This was reflected in a global three-dimensional distance distribution skewed toward shorter distances in the head (Table S1, available online). Later during development, the association between Antp and Abd-B was reinforced in anterior larval tissues compared to more posterior tissues such as leg and wing discs, where only Antp is active (Figure S1A and Table S2). Antp also colocalized with the repressed Ubx gene in the head compartment of embryonic nuclei, and this interaction was lost in the trunk (PS4/5), where Antp is active. In the posterior PS, however, where both Ubx and Antp are repressed, they colocalized significantly more than in PS4/5 (Figures S1B and S1C and Table S2). This indicates that Hox gene kissing correlates with the repression status of both Hox genes. Next we combined FISH with immunostaining using a Polycomb antibody (FISH-I) to analyze the nuclear localization of Antp, Abd-B, and Ubx relative to PcG bodies. Repressed genes are associated with large PcG bodies in 80% to 85% of the cases. In embryo heads, where both Antp and Abd-B are colocalized, the two genes were found in the same PcG body (Figure 1D). In posterior segments, Abd-B is clearly outside PcG bodies in 80% of the cases (Figure 1D), although the two Hox complexes can still associate via kissing of Antp and Ubx within PcG bodies (Figure S1C). In the thoracic PS4/5, in which the Antp gene is activated, Antp is outside PcG bodies in 85% of the cases, while Abd-B and Ubx are inside (data not shown), correlating with the lack of colocalization between Antp and the other genes. We then analyzed whether PcG proteins are required for Hox gene kissing. First, two non-PcG target genes, beat-Vc and CG17622, which are located on chromosome 3R and separated by 10 Mb like the Hox complexes, colocalize in less than 5% of the nuclei (Figure 1E and Table S1). Second, in the head of Polycomb and Polycomb-like mutant embryos, the Antp and Abd-B genes colocalize in about 5% of the nuclei, i.e., much less than in WT and close to the two control genes beat-Vc and CG17622 (Figure 1F and Table S1). This indicates that PcG proteins are required for pairing of the two loci. Even heterozygous mutations in the Pc and Pcl genes reduced the frequency of gene kissing in anterior larval tissues (Figure 1G and Table S1). These data show that Hox gene kissing occurs within PcG bodies in a PcG-dependent manner. In order to analyze whether Hox loci only contact each other or whether they have other interacting partners in the nucleus, we developed a modified 4C protocol (see Experimental Procedures, Figure S2, and Figure S3). The Fab-7 element from the BX-C regulates the Abd-B expression and plays a role in long distance interactions inside the BX-C as well as at greater genomic distances (Bantignies et al., 2003Bantignies F. Grimaud C. Lavrov S. Gabut M. Cavalli G. Inheritance of Polycomb-dependent chromosomal interactions in Drosophila.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2406-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, Lanzuolo et al., 2007Lanzuolo C. Roure V. Dekker J.

Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used Fab-7 as the 4C bait fragment in order to analyze its interaction with other loci along the 3R chromosome arm in larval brain and anterior larval discs. We found an extensive series of interactions along the 3R chromosome arm (Figure 2A ). The strongest interactions occur within the BX-C. Other strong interactors are two PcG target regions, the ss and srp-pnr loci, located at a distance of 0.5 and 1 Mb, respectively (see Figure 2B). Significant interaction events are also observed at long distances. Four are particularly strong, corresponding to the NK-C, E5/ems, prospero and the ANT-C loci, and four others are weaker, corresponding to the grn, hth, pnt, and Drop loci (Figures 2A and 2C). Strikingly, all these major 4C hits are Polycomb bound regions (Schuettengruber et al., 2009Schuettengruber B. Ganapathi M. Leblanc B. Portoso M. Jaschek R. Tolhuis B. van Lohuizen M. Tanay A. Cavalli G. Functional Anatomy of Polycomb and Trithorax Chromatin Landscapes in Drosophila Embryos.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e13Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Moreover, a global analysis indicates that the 4C hits are highly enriched in Polycomb and its associated H3K27me3 repressive chromatin mark (Figure 2D).Figure S3Reproducibility of 4C Experiments and Statistical Analysis of Long-Range Interactions, Related to Figure 2 and Figure 5Show full caption(A) Processed 4C profiles as log-ratios on chromosome 3R, showing from top to bottom: WT-r1, WT-r2 (replicates 1 and 2 of 4C experiments in WT), F12-r1 and F12-r2 (replicates 1 and 2 of 4C experiments in the Fab-712 line), with WT-r1 paired with F12-r1, and WT-r2 paired with F12-r2.(B) Control scatter plots showing per probe reproducibility of processed 4C log-ratios between replicates as well as between paired experiments.(C) Per replicate 4C profile domainograms on chromosome 3R corresponding to, from top to bottom: WT-r1, WT-r2, F12-r1 and F12-r2 experiments.(D) Example of a domainogram corresponding to one of the random permutations of the 4C profiles that were used to estimate statistical score thresholds.

They are organized in tandem and expressed in a few specialized cells in the embryonic parasegments and in the head (Jagla et al., 1997aJagla K. Frasch M. Jagla T. Dretzen G. Bellard F.

The BX-C and NK-C loci colocalized in approximately 20% of the nuclei in the head and in PS4/5 where both genes are repressed in most of the cells. This interaction decreased significantly in PS13 where Abd-B is active and lbl mostly repressed (Figure 3B and Table S3). “Ménage à trois” type of contacts among Antp-Abd-B-lbl are rarely observed (approximately 1% of the nuclei in embryonic heads, Figure S4), indicating that gene contacts are not all occurring simultaneously. To appreciate whether the colocalization frequency of divergently expressed PcG target genes may reflect background behavior, we then analyzed by FISH the distance between Abd-B and beat-Vc, a non-PcG target gene that lies 4.2 Mb away from Abd-B, a distance similar to the lbl/lbe locus. In all tissues, the frequencies of colocalization were similar to those observed for Abd-B and lbl/lbe in a divergently expressing tissue, while they were lower than in tissues corepressing Abd-B and lbl/lbe (Figure 3C and Table S3). This suggests that PcG-mediated silencing specifically induces gene kissing.Figure S4Rare “Ménage à Trois” between Antp, Abd-B, and lbl/lbe, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Three-color FISH with the Abd-B, Antp, lbl/lbe loci.

These results confirm the observation that gene contacts between PcG target genes are more frequent when the genes are corepressed.

Here, we show that yeast INO80 facilitates these diverse processes at least in part by controlling genome-wide distribution of the histone variant H2A.Z. In the absence of INO80, H2A.Z nucleosomes are mislocalized, and H2A.Z levels at promoters show reduced responsiveness to transcriptional changes, suggesting that INO80 controls H2A.Z dynamics. Additionally, we demonstrate that INO80 has a histone-exchange activity in which the enzyme can replace nucleosomal H2A.Z/H2B with free H2A/H2B dimers. Genetic interactions between ino80 and htz1 support a model in which INO80 catalyzes the removal of unacetylated H2A.Z from chromatin as a mechanism to promote genome stability."

Moreover, germline mutations of PTEN have been identified in cancer-susceptibility syndromes such as Cowden syndrome (Di Cristofano et al., 1998Di Cristofano A. Pesce B. Cordon-Cardo C. Pandolfi P.P.

Furthermore, cells harboring phosphatase-inactive PTEN mutants retain residual tumor-suppressive activity, leading to the hypothesis that PTEN exerts functions that are independent of its phosphatase activity (Blanco-Aparicio et al., 2007Blanco-Aparicio C.

Mechanistically, we have reported that ubiquitination of PTEN regulates its nuclear compartmentalization (Song et al., 2008Song M.S. Salmena L. Carracedo A. Egia A. Lo-Coco F. Teruya-Feldstein J.

However, the tumor-suppressive functions of PTEN within the nucleus still remain poorly defined. Cell-cycle progression is controlled by ubiquitination-mediated proteolysis of cell-cycle machinery. The two major E3 ubiquitin ligases controlling this process are SCF (Skp1/Cullin/F-box protein complex) and APC/C (anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome). SCF mainly controls target protein levels during S phase, whereas APC/C is thought to be active from mitosis to late G1 (Cardozo and Pagano, 2004Cardozo T. Pagano M.

The anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome: a machine designed to destroy.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). APC/C contains at least 11 different structural subunits, and its activity is controlled through the binding of CDC20 and CDH1, which recognize and recruit specific substrates. CDC20 is active in early mitosis whereas CDH1 activity is restricted to late mitosis and G1 (Pines, 2006Pines J.

Morgan D.O. Finishing mitosis, one step at a time.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 894-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Specific APC/C substrates include mitotic cyclins (Cyclins A and B), mitotic kinases (Aurora kinases, PLK1, Nek2A), proteins involved in chromosome segregation (Securin, Sgo1), DNA replication proteins (Geminin, Cdc6), an F-box protein (SKP2), and transcription factors (Ets2, FoxM1) (Manchado et al., 2010Manchado E.

The emerging role of APC/CCdh1 in controlling differentiation, genomic stability and tumor suppression.Oncogene. 2010; 29: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Of importance, APC-CDH1 substrates, such as Cyclin A, PLK1, Aurora A, CDC20, or SKP2, are overexpressed in human tumors and are associated with chromosomal instability and poor prognosis (Carter et al., 2006Carter S.L. Eklund A.C. Kohane I.S. Harris L.N. Szallasi Z. A signature of chromosomal instability inferred from gene expression profiles predicts clinical outcome in multiple human cancers.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 1043-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). In mice, Cdh1 heterozygosity results in the development of epithelial tumors, suggesting that CDH1 may be a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor (Garcia-Higuera et al., 2008Garcia-Higuera I. Manchado E. Dubus P. Canamero M. Mendez J. Moreno S. Malumbres M. Genomic stability and tumour suppression by the APC/C cofactor Cdh1.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 802-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Downregulation of CDH1 has been reported in many cancers, including those of prostate, ovary, liver, and brain, and during the malignant progression of a B-lymphoma cell line (Bassermann et al., 2008Bassermann F. Frescas D. Guardavaccaro D. Busino L. Peschiaroli A. Pagano M.

Overexpression of murine fizzy-related (fzr) increases natural killer cell-mediated cell death and suppresses tumor growth.Blood. 2000; 96: 259-263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, inactivation of APC-CDH1 in cancer may lead to unchecked accumulation of its targets with profound consequences for cell-cycle and genomic stability. In this study, we demonstrate that nuclear PTEN directly enhances the activity of APC/C by promoting its association with CDH1. Conversely, PTEN loss impairs the activity of the APC-CDH1 tumor-suppressive complex. Critically, PTEN activates APC-CDH1 in a phosphatase-independent manner, an observation that has important implications for cancer therapy. In order to identify novel tumor-suppressive pathways regulated by PTEN, we immunoprecipitated exogenous Myc-tagged PTEN from the nuclear extracts of PTEN-deficient PC3 cells and identified interacting proteins by mass spectrometry (Figure 1A and Figure S1A available online). Remarkably, four APC/C constituents including APC3/CDC27, APC4, APC5,and APC7 were identified as nuclear PTEN-associated proteins. We validated the binding between endogenous PTEN and the four APC/C components in DU145 cells by performing reciprocal immunoprecipitations (Figure 1B) and observed that the binding was restricted to the nucleus (Figures S1B and S1C). Notably, an in vitro binding assay revealed that the interaction of PTEN with APC3 is restricted to the COOH terminus of PTEN, indicating that the N-terminal phosphatase domain is dispensable for this interaction (Figure 1C). Critically, PTEN immunoprecipitation complexes displayed ubiquitinating ability toward the well-established APC/C target Cyclin B (Figure 1D).Figure S1Related to Figure 1 and Figure 2Show full captionIdentification of APC/C as nuclear PTEN-interacting protein.(A) Identification of novel nuclear PTEN-associated proteins.

Top panel shows the density unit (D.U.) of Cyclin B-Ub conjugates analyzed by the ImageJ 1.38× software. We next assessed the functional relevance of this physical interaction. To test whether PTEN directly affects the levels of APC/C targets, we developed a model system in which we could dissociate the consequences of acute PTEN induction from the ensuing cell-cycle effects. For this we used a Tetracyclin-inducible (Tet-on)-PTEN cellular system in asynchronously growing PC3 cells (Rubin et al., 1991Rubin S.J. Hallahan D.E. Ashman C.R. Brachman D.G. Beckett M.A. Virudachalam S. Yandell D.W. Weichselbaum R.R. Two prostate carcinoma cell lines demonstrate abnormalities in tumor suppressor genes.J. Surg. Oncol. 1991; 46: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this cellular system, acute PTEN induction precedes any sizable effects on cell-cycle distribution for at least 12 hr (Figure 1E). By contrast, in this timeframe PTEN induction led to a marked and rapid proteasome-dependent downregulation of APC/C targets. This was reverted by MG132 treatment, at time points much earlier than any detectable effect on cell-cycle distribution (Figure 1E). Moreover, we found that APC/CDH1 target levels were increased in vivo in Pten null prostates at time points where the incidence of prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and the increase of cell proliferation are low (Figure 1F, Figure S1D, and data not shown). Similarly, PTEN silencing in DU145 cells led to the upregulation of the APC/C targets, Cyclin A2, Geminin, PLK1, Aurora A, and CDC20, whereas overexpression of PTEN in PTEN-deficient LNCaP and PC3 cells reduced APC/C target levels concomitant with G1 cell-cycle arrest (Figures S1E and S1F). Our data show that PTEN interacts with components of the APC/C complex and PTEN status alters the level of APC/C complex target proteins. Thus, we hypothesized that PTEN can regulate the ubiquitin ligase activity of APC/C. Indeed, in vitro APC/C ubiquitin ligase assays revealed that Cyclin B ubiquitination by APC/C was increased in a dose-dependent manner by recombinant PTEN protein in the presence of CDH1 (Figure 2A ). By contrast, the ubiquitin ligase activity of APC/C was reduced in Pten−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) compared to wild-type cells (Figure 2B). Remarkably, nuclear but not cytoplasmic PTEN immunoprecipitates were capable of ubiquitinating Cyclin B (Figure 2C). Next, we sought to ascertain the mechanism by which PTEN regulates APC/C function. APC/C activation occurs upon the association with two different adaptor proteins, CDC20 and CDH1 (Cardozo and Pagano, 2004Cardozo T. Pagano M. The SCF ubiquitin ligase: insights into a molecular machine.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, Peters, 2006Peters J.M. The anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome: a machine designed to destroy.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Whereas CDC20 activates APC/C in early mitosis, APC-CDH1 is active in late mitosis and during G1 (Pines, 2006Pines J. Mitosis: a matter of getting rid of the right protein at the right time.Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 55-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, Sullivan and Morgan, 2007Sullivan M. Morgan D.O. Finishing mitosis, one step at a time.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 894-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In vitro Cyclin B ubiquitination assays revealed that the ubiquitin ligase activity of PTEN immunoprecipitates in interphase was higher than in mitosis (Figure S1G). We therefore examined whether PTEN regulates the formation of the APC-CDH1 complex. In vivo, reintroduction of PTEN into PC3 cells increased the association between APC3 and CDH1 (Figure 2D, top panel), whereas PTEN knockdown in DU145 dramatically reduced the coimmunoprecipitation of APC3 and CDH1 (Figure 2D, bottom panel). In vitro binding assay revealed that PTEN favors the assembly between APC3 and CDH1 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2E). Taken together, these results suggest that PTEN promotes the association between APC and CDH1, thereby enhancing the activity of APC-CDH1. Despite the increasing number of studies emphasizing the importance of nuclear PTEN as a tumor suppressor (Planchon et al., 2008Planchon S.M. Waite K.A. Eng C. The nuclear affairs of PTEN.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, Salmena et al., 2008Salmena L. Carracedo A. Pandolfi P.P. Tenets of PTEN tumor suppression.Cell. 2008; 133: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar), how nuclear PTEN exerts its tumor-suppressive activity remains unclear. We have demonstrated that PTEN monoubiquitination at lysines 13 and 289 is essential for its nuclear localization and tumor-suppressive function, and conversely, deubiquitination of PTEN by HAUSP renders PTEN predominantly cytoplasmic (Song et al., 2008Song M.S. Salmena L. Carracedo A. Egia A. Lo-Coco F. Teruya-Feldstein J. Pandolfi P.P. The deubiquitinylation and localization of PTEN are regulated by a HAUSP-PML network.Nature. 2008; 455: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, Trotman et al., 2007Trotman L.C. Wang X.

Therefore, we tested whether a nuclear-excluded PTENK13,289E mutant (Figure 3A ) could still regulate APC-CDH1. In vivo ubiquitination assay showed that, unlike wild-type PTEN, nuclear-excluded PTENK13,289E was unable to promote the Cyclin B ubiquitination and to reduce the level of APC-CDH1 targets despite antagonizing AKT activation (Figure 3B and Figure S2A ). Importantly, coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that PTENK13,289E mutant failed to interact with APC3 (Figure 3C). Because both PTEN and APC-CDH1 are known negative regulators of cell proliferation (Salmena et al., 2008Salmena L. Carracedo A. Pandolfi P.P.

The emerging role of APC/CCdh1 in controlling differentiation, genomic stability and tumor suppression.Oncogene. 2010; 29: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we next examined the effects of nuclear exclusion of PTEN on cell growth. BrdU incorporation analysis revealed that nuclear-excluded PTENK13,289E mutant was ineffective in suppressing S phase entry after release from nocodazole block, whereas PTENWT significantly delayed the G1-S transition accompanied with a reduction in the level of APC-CDH1 targets (Figure 3D and Figure S2B). This observation is of critical relevance as it allowed us to uncouple the effect of PTEN on Akt and APC-CDH1 toward cell-cycle regulation. In line with this notion, PTENWT but not PTENK13,289E overexpression led to a downregulation of CDK2 activity due to reduction in the level of Cyclin A2 rather than Cyclin E at the G1-S transition, suggesting that nuclear PTEN might regulate the G1-S transition through reduction in the level of Cyclin A2, an APC-CDH1 target (Figure 3E). We also ascertained whether the delay in S phase entry by PTEN could be due to failure to be released from the nocodazole block or to exit from mitosis. PTENK13,289E as well as PTENWT overexpression had little impact on mitotic exit, as measured by the positivity of phospho-histone H3 (Figures S2C and S2D). In addition, PTENWT- or PTENK13,289E-expressing PC3 cells exhibited similar proportions of cells in mitosis upon nocodazole block, suggesting that PTEN might not be involved in spindle checkpoint (SAC) as well. Taken together, these results suggest that nuclear localization of PTEN is necessary for activation of APC-CDH1, thereby regulating cell-cycle progression.Figure S2Related to Figure 3Show full captionNuclear-excluded PTENK13,289E mutant impairs regulation of APC-CDH1 targets.(A) PTENK13,289E mutant impairs reduction of APC-CDH1 targets.

How these components are recruited to nascent autophagosomes is poorly understood, and although much is known about signaling mechanisms that restrain autophagy, the nature of positive inductive signals that can promote autophagy remain cryptic. We find that the Ras-like small G protein, RalB, is localized to nascent autophagosomes and is activated on nutrient deprivation. RalB and its effector Exo84 are required for nutrient starvation-induced autophagocytosis, and RalB activation is sufficient to promote autophagosome formation. Through direct binding to Exo84, RalB induces the assembly of catalytically active ULK1 and Beclin1-VPS34 complexes on the exocyst, which are required for isolation membrane formation and maturation. Thus, RalB signaling is a primary adaptive response to nutrient limitation that directly engages autophagocytosis through mobilization of the core vesicle nucleation machinery.

Among the earliest is the dephosphorylation of inhibitory mTOR-dependent sites on the ULK1-Atg13-FIP200 induction complex (Hosokawa et al., 2009aHosokawa N. Hara T. Kaizuka T. Kishi C. Takamura A.

This presumably releases ULK1 activity to facilitate auto-phosphorylation of the ULK1-ATG13-FIP200 complex and assembly with the vertebrate-specific autophagy protein ATG101 (Hosokawa et al., 2009aHosokawa N.

Through currently undescribed mechanisms, this leads to the activation of an autophagy specific class III PI(3)K complex, the Beclin1-ATG14L-VPS34-VPS15 complex. This activity coats a cup-shaped isolation membrane with phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, PI(3)P, which serves as a recruitment signal for the ATG16-ATG5/ATG12 component of the isolation membrane elongation machinery (Suzuki et al., 2001Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. The pre-autophagosomal structure organized by concerted functions of APG genes is essential for autophagosome formation.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Two ubiquitin-like molecules, ATG12 and LC3, undergo conjugation to ATG5 and phosphatidylethanolamine respectively to promote autophagosome formation. ATG12 is activated by ATG7 (E1), transferred to ATG10 (E2), followed by covalent linkage to an internal lysine on ATG5 (Mizushima et al., 1998aMizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T.

In the second conjugation system, LC3 is first cleaved by the cysteine protease, ATG4, which exposes a C-terminal glycine residue. ATG7 (E1) activates LC3 and transfers it to ATG3 (E2) (Amar et al., 2006Amar N. Lustig G. Ichimura Y. Ohsumi Y. Elazar Z.

These key signaling events are coordinated with dynamic membrane events to culminate in the formation of a double-membrane autophagosome. The autophagosome ultimately fuses with a lysosome that facilitates the turnover of engulfed material by lysosomal/vacuolar acid hydrolases. How signaling intermediates are coordinated with the dynamic membrane events during the autophagosome biogenesis is currently unknown. RalA and RalB are close relatives to the founding members of the Ras GTPase superfamily. They are engaged in response to mitogenic, trophic, and hormonal signals by a diverse group of guanyl nucleotide exchange factors that fall into two major groups: those that are directly Ras-responsive via a carboxy terminal Ras binding domain and those that are apparently mobilized by phosphoinositide second messengers via a carboxy terminal Pleckstrin homology domain (Bodemann and White, 2008Bodemann B.O.

Ral-GTPases: approaching their 15 minutes of fame.Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 419-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Although a number of RalGTP effector proteins have been identified that couple RalA/B activation to dynamic cell biological processes, an overarching occupation of the Ral GTPases is the direct regulation of the Sec6/8, or exocyst, complex (Bodemann and White, 2008Bodemann B.O.

Two members of the heterooctomeric exocyst complex, Sec5 (EXOC2) and Exo84 (EXOC8), are bona fide effector molecules that mediate RalA/B regulation of dynamic secretory vesicle targeting and tethering processes (Bodemann and White, 2008Bodemann B.O.

Cell. 2007; 13: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Distinct from regulation of membrane trafficking, RalB has been demonstrated to mediate signal transduction cascades supporting the host defense response. On Toll-like receptor activation, RalB/Sec5 complex assembly directly participates in activation of the innate immune signaling kinase TBK1 to facilitate an interferon response (Chien et al., 2006Chien Y. Kim S. Bumeister R. Loo Y.M. Kwon S.W. Johnson C.L. Balakireva M.G. Romeo Y. Kopelovich L. Gale Jr., M. et al.RalB GTPase-mediated activation of the IkappaB family kinase TBK1 couples innate immune signaling to tumor cell survival.Cell. 2006; 127: 157-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This combination of roles, vesicle trafficking/tethering and signal cascade assembly/activation, suggests that Ral/exocyst effector complexes may coordinate dynamic membrane trafficking events with stimulus-dependent signaling events. Here we show that the small G protein, RalB, and an Exo84-dependent subcomplex of the exocyst are critical for nutrient starvation and pathogen-induced autophagosome formation. Native RalB proteins localize to sites of nascent autophagosome formation and accumulate in the “active” GTP-bound state under nutrient limited conditions. RalB, but not its close homolog RalA, is required for autophagosome biogenesis and is sufficient to activate autophagy in human epithelial cells. The mechanism of action is through direct triggering of vesicle nucleation by assembly of an active ULK1-Beclin1-VPS34 initiation complex on the RalB effector protein Exo84. Thus, the RalB-Exo84 effector complex defines a key proximal regulatory component of the cellular response to nutrient deprivation. Accumulating observations indicate direct participation of the heterooctomeric exocyst (aka Sec6/8) complex in adaptive responses to pathogen challenge (Bhuvanakantham et al., 2010Bhuvanakantham R.

Most strikingly, core innate immune signaling through TBK1 and STING is supported by the Sec5 subunit of the exocyst (Chien et al., 2006Chien Y. Kim S. Bumeister R. Loo Y.M. Kwon S.W. Johnson C.L.

Barber G.N. STING regulates intracellular DNA-mediated, type I interferon-dependent innate immunity.Nature. 2009; 461: 788-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). To help generate molecular leads that may account for the participation of exocyst components in host defense signaling, we used high throughput yeast two-hybrid screening to isolate a cohort of proteins that can associate with exocyst subunits (Formstecher et al., 2005Formstecher E. Aresta S. Collura V. Hamburger A. Meil A. Trehin A. Reverdy C. Betin V. Maire S. Brun C. et al.Protein interaction mapping: a Drosophila case study.Genome Res. 2005; 15: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Among this cohort, both negative (RUBICON) and positive (FIP200, ATG14L) modulators of autophagy were isolated in the first-degree interaction neighborhood of Sec3 (see Experimental Procedures). Given the functional convergence of Ral/exocyst signaling and autophagy in pathogen recognition and clearance, we examined the association of exocyst components and autophagy proteins in human epithelial cell cultures. The interaction of Sec3 with RUBICON and ATG14L was validated by expression co-IP (Figures 1A and 1B). In addition Exo84 and Sec5 could interact with RUBICON and ATG14L, as would be expected if autophagosome machinery/exocyst interactions occur in the context of multisubunit exocyst complexes (Figures 1C–1F). Immunoprecipitation of the core exocyst subunit, Sec8, recovers all characterized components of the exocyst complex (Grindstaff et al., 1998Grindstaff K.K. Yeaman C. Anandasabapathy N. Hsu S.C.

Therefore, to examine if the exocyst may be associated with the LC3-modification machinery that drives elongation of isolation membranes, we probed Sec8 complexes for the presence of ATG5/ATG12 conjugates. As shown, Sec8-ATG5/ATG12 complexes were recovered from both overexpression co-IPs (Figure 1G) and by coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins (Figure 1H), indicating a physical integration of the exocyst and autophagosome assembly machinery.

To examine the potential participation of Ral GTPase signaling in the regulation of autophagy, we first tested the consequence of blocking Ral-GTP/effector interactions on amino acid starvation-induced autophagosome accumulation and on isolation membrane encapsulation of bacterial pathogens. Expression of the minimal Ral-binding domain of the Ral effector RalBP1/RLIP76 (RLIP[RBD]) is dominant inhibitory to the action of endogenous RalA and RalB proteins through direct competition with Ral effector molecules (Chien et al., 2006Chien Y.

RLIP(RBD) expression blocked both LC3 punctae formation and LC3 turnover (Figure 1I). As a surrogate measure for autophagic flux, we quantitated the total endogenous LC3 signal of individual cells after amino acid starvation, and found that RLIP(RBD) expression inhibited LC3 protein turnover in a dose-dependent fashion (Figure 1K). To investigate the contribution of Ral signaling to pathogen-responsive LC3 modification of membranes, mRFP-LC3 expressing HeLa cells were infected with GFP-labeled Salmonellae typhimurium. As expected if Ral signaling supports this response, RLIP(RBD) expression blocked recruitment of LC3 to internalized Salmonellae (Figure 1J). In addition, we found that ectopic expression of RalB was sufficient to induce the accumulation of LC3 punctae in cervical cancer cells (Figures 1L and 1M) and in immortalized bronchial epithelial cells (Figured 1N and 1O) in the absence of amino acid starvation or pathogen exposure. Remarkably, RalB(G23V) expression in nutrient rich conditions was sufficient to induce an accumulation of LC3 punctae that was 4–5-fold higher than that induced by amino acid deprivation (Figure 1O). This accumulation is likely associated with increased autophagic flux as RalB(G23V)-induced LC3 punctae were further increased by chloroquine-mediated inhibition of autophagosome turnover (Figure 1O; p = 0.011, Student's t test), and this correlated with accumulation of phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated LC3 (Figure 1P). Thus Ral signaling appears to be necessary and sufficient to engage autophagy. Evaluation of interactions between Ral signaling and autophagy in animals was carried out in Drosophila dRal hypomorphs (Ral35d), which have a weak loss-of-bristle phenotype associated with post-mitotic cell-specific apoptosis (Balakireva et al., 2006Balakireva M. Rossé C. Langevin J. Chien Y.C. Gho M. Gonzy-Treboul G. Voegeling-Lemaire S. Aresta S. Lepesant J.A.

Biol. 2006; 26: 8953-8963Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Depletion of ATG14L, ATG1 (ULK1), ATG8a (LC3), ATG6 (Beclin), or VPS34, by in vivo expression of corresponding dsRNA, significantly enhanced the Ral35d phenotype (see Table S1 available online). To directly investigate the individual contributions of human Ral GTPases and exocyst proteins to regulated autophagosome biogenesis, we next tested the consequence of siRNA-mediated RalA, RalB, and exocyst subunit depletion on nutrient starvation-induced autophagy. Depletion of RalA, in a stable GFP-LC3 expressing cell line, had no consequence on GFP-LC3 signal accumulation or punctae formation. In contrast, RalB depletion significantly impaired starvation-induced LC3 punctae formation and LC3 turnover (Figure 2A ). The extent of autophagosome inhibition observed on RalB depletion, as monitored by quantitation of GFP-LC3 punctae and total GFP-LC3 signal intensity, was equivalent to that seen on depletion of the known components of autophagosome formation, ATG5 or Beclin1 (Figures 2B and 2C). An equivalent analysis of the exocyst subunits Sec8, Sec5, and Exo84 indicated selective contributions of exocyst components to presumed autophagosome formation. Depletion of Sec8, a central exocyst subunit, had equivalent consequences as depletion of RalB, ATG5, or Beclin1. In contrast, among the two Ral effectors in the exocyst, Sec5 and Exo84, only Exo84 depletion impaired starvation-induced LC3 punctae formation and increased LC3 accumulation (Figures 2B and 2C). Evaluation of each of the eight exocyst subunits suggested that in addition to Sec8 and Exo84, Sec3 and Exo70 are limiting for support of autophagocytosis (Figure 2D and Figure S1A ). The selective requirement for Exo84 versus Sec5 indicates that RalB regulation of autophagy is likely independent of the previously characterized RalB/Sec5/TBK1 signaling pathway (Chien et al., 2006Chien Y.

https://openalex.org/W2051932976,"Gene-selective epigenetic reprogramming and shifts in cellular bioenergetics develop when Toll-like receptors (TLR) recognize and respond to systemic life-threatening infections. Using a human monocyte cell model of endotoxin tolerance and human leukocytes from acute systemic inflammation with sepsis, we report that energy sensor sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) coordinates the epigenetic and bioenergy shifts. After TLR4 signaling, SIRT1 rapidly accumulated at the promoters of TNF-α and IL-1β, but not IκBα; SIRT1 promoter binding was dependent on its co-factor, NAD(+). During this initial process, SIRT1 deacetylated RelA/p65 lysine 310 and nucleosomal histone H4 lysine 16 to promote termination of NFκB-dependent transcription. SIRT1 then remained promoter bound and recruited de novo induced RelB, which directed assembly of the mature transcription repressor complex that generates endotoxin tolerance. SIRT1 also promoted de novo expression of RelB. During sustained endotoxin tolerance, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), the rate-limiting enzyme for endogenous production of NAD(+), and SIRT1 expression increased. The elevation of SIRT1 required protein stabilization and enhanced translation. To support the coordination of bioenergetics in human sepsis, we observed elevated NAD(+) levels concomitant with SIRT1 and RelB accumulation at the TNF-α promoter of endotoxin tolerant sepsis blood leukocytes. We conclude that TLR4 stimulation and human sepsis activate pathways that couple NAD(+) and its sensor SIRT1 with epigenetic reprogramming."

The underlying signalling pathways, of major clinicopathological relevance, are unknown. We combined genome-wide expression profiling with genetic complementation to identify genes that are differentially expressed when conditionally immortalised human fibroblasts undergo senescence upon activation of the p16-pRB and p53-p21 tumour suppressor pathways. This identified 816 up and 961 downregulated genes whose expression was reversed when senescence was bypassed. Overlay of this data set with the meta-signatures of genes upregulated in cancer showed that nearly 50% of them were downregulated upon senescence showing that even though overcoming senescence may only be one of the events required for malignant transformation, nearly half of the genes upregulated in cancer are related to it. Moreover 65 of the up and 26 of the downregulated genes are known downstream targets of nuclear factor (NF)-κB suggesting that senescence was associated with activation of the NF-κB pathway. Direct perturbation of this pathway bypasses growth arrest indicating that activation of NF-κB signalling has a causal role in promoting senescence."

After introducing chromatin organization and its impact on gene regulation and human health, we then describe methods that detect nucleosome positioning and occupancy levels using chromatin immunoprecipitation in combination with deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq), a strategy that is now straightforward and cost efficient.

https://openalex.org/W1980098393,"There is now evidence for both increased and decreased activity of the enzymes controlling the methylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27) in cancer. One of these enzymes, KDM6B formally known as JMJD3, a histone demethylase, which removes the trimethyl mark from H3K27, is required for the lineage commitment and terminal differentiation of neural stem cells and of keratinocytes. Our results suggest that KDM6B may also have a role in antigen-driven B-cell differentiation. KDM6B expression increases in B-cell subsets with increasing stage of differentiation, and gene expression profiling shows that KDM6B transcriptional targets in germinal centre B (GC B) cells are significantly enriched for those differentially expressed during memory and plasma cell differentiation. Our results also suggest that aberrant expression of KDM6B may contribute to the pathogenesis of Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL), an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) associated malignancy. KDM6B is over-expressed in primary HL and induced by the EBV oncogene, latent membrane protein (LMP1) in GC B cells, the presumptive progenitors of HL. Consistent with these observations, we found that KDM6B transcriptional targets in GC B cells are enriched for genes differentially expressed in HL, and that KDM6B depletion can restore the tri-methylation of H3K27 on these genes."

Interestingly, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), the miR-23b target, is detected in cervical cancer, but not in normal cervical tissues. Thus, the importance of miR-23b and uPA in HPV-associated cervical cancer development is investigated. In this study, the high-risk subtype HPV-16 E6 oncoprotein was found to decrease the expression of miR-23b, increase the expression of uPA, and thus induce the migration of human cervical carcinoma SiHa and CaSki cells. uPA is the target gene for miR-23b as the miR repressed uPA expression and interacted with the 3'-untranslated region of uPA mRNA. The tumor suppressor p53 is known to be inactivated by HPV-16 E6. A consensus p53 binding site is detected in the promoter region of miR-23b, whereas p53 trans-activated and also interacted with the miR's promoter. Therefore, p53 is believed to mediate the HPV-16 E6 downregulation of miR-23b. From the above, miR-23b/uPA are confirmed to be involved in HPV-16 E6-associated cervical cancer development."

A built-in lid encapsulates substrate proteins within the central chaperonin chamber. Here, we describe the fate of the substrate during the nucleotide cycle of group II chaperonins. The chaperonin substrate-binding sites are exposed, and the lid is open in both the ATP-free and ATP-bound prehydrolysis states. ATP hydrolysis has a dual function in the folding cycle, triggering both lid closure and substrate release into the central chamber. Notably, substrate release can occur in the absence of a lid, and lid closure can occur without substrate release. However, productive folding requires both events, so that the polypeptide is released into the confined space of the closed chamber where it folds. Our results show that ATP hydrolysis coordinates the structural and functional determinants that trigger productive folding."

Here we investigated whether sortilin, a Vps10p domain-sorting receptor believed to participate in retromer-mediated transport of select membrane cargoes, contributes to the subcellular trafficking and activity of BACE1. Our initial studies revealed increased levels of sortilin in post-mortem brain tissue of AD patients and that overexpression of sortilin leads to increased BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP in cultured cells. In contrast, RNAi suppression of sortilin results in decreased BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP. We also found that sortilin interacts with BACE1 and that a sortilin construct lacking its cytoplasmic domain, which contains putative retromer sorting motifs, remains bound to BACE1. However, expression of this truncated sortilin redistributes BACE1 from the trans-Golgi network to the endosomes and substantially reduces the retrograde trafficking of BACE1.

Cancer. 2008; 112: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). p27 was originally described as a CDK inhibitor, with cyclin E-CDK2 complexes as its primary targets (17Polyak K. Lee M.H.

Science. 1996; 272: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Low p27 levels are associated with a poor prognosis in most tumors (19Chu I.M. Hengst L. Slingerland J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 253-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 20Slingerland J. Pagano M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). p27 is regulated mainly at the protein stability level. The degradation of p27 by proteosomes is preceded by ubiquitylation (21Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar), which is mediated by the SCFSKP2 complex, in which SKP2 is the p27-recognizing subunit (22Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A.

To be recognized by the SCFSKP2 complex, p27 must be bound to cyclin-CDK complexes and phosphorylated at Thr-187. p27 bound to cyclin E-CDK2 is a target for phosphorylation by the bound CDK2 or a second active cyclin E-CDK2 complex at Thr-187 (reviewed in Refs. 25Galea C.A.

Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 2342-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The oncogenic activity of SKP2 is attributed mainly to low p27 levels, and consistently, the levels of SKP2 and p27 inversely correlate in many tumors and cell models (13Hershko D.D.

MYC and p27 show functional antagonism in proliferation: MYC and the loss of p27 cooperate in animal carcinogenesis models (27Martins C.P. Berns A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3739-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and MYC abrogates p27 function in proliferation. The antagonistic effect of MYC is mediated through several mechanisms (reviewed in Refs. 11Lutz W. Leon J. Eilers M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 61-71PubMed Google Scholar). MYC down-regulates murine p27 at the transcriptional level (28Yang W. Shen J. Wu M. Arsura M. FitzGerald M. Suldan Z. Kim D.W. Hofmann C.S. Pianetti S. Romieu-Mourez R. Freedman L.P. Sonenshein G.E.

A correlation between MYC and SKP2 expression was recently described in a murine lymphoma model, with only modest effects on p27 levels (34Old J.B. Kratzat S. Hoellein A. Graf S. Nilsson J.A.

The previous studies are nonetheless hampered by the fact that SKP2 is induced in cell cycle stimulation, which is also a well known MYC activity. This has made it difficult to distinguish whether SKP2 induction is a direct effect of MYC. Here we studied the MYC-SKP2-p27 axis in different cell models with conditional MYC expression in which MYC is induced in cell cycle-arrested cells. We show for here that SKP2 is a direct MYC target gene and that MYC-mediated SKP2 up-regulation contributes to p27 degradation.

Cell proliferation was determined by cell counting in a hemocytometer. KMERpSR or KMERshSKP2 cells (107) were resuspended in 0.2 ml of RPMI/Geltrex (Invitrogen) (1:1). The cell suspension was injected subcutaneously into the right and left flanks of 6-week-old female athymic nude mice (Hsd:Athymic Nude-Foxn1 nu/nu; Harlan Laboratories models); after 21–24 days, the mice were euthanized, and the tumors were weighed. Total RNA from cell lines and bone marrow cells was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RT was performed with i-Script reverse transcriptase (Bio-Rad). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed with the SYBRGreen PCR kit (Bio-Rad). The sequences of primers used and amplicon sizes are shown in supplemental Table S1. The data were normalized to ribosomal protein S14 mRNA levels. Total cell lysates and immunoblots were carried out as described (39Muñoz-Alonso M.J. Acosta J.C. Richard C. Delgado M.D. Sedivy J.

ChIP was performed using Dynabeads-Protein G (Dynal Biotech) coupled to anti-MYC antibody and rabbit IgG as specificity control. Quantitative PCR of eluted DNA was performed with the primers of SKP2 and lactate dehydrogenase genes indicated in supplemental Table S1. Kp27MER cells were treated with ZnSO4 and/or 4HT for 24 h and immunostained with anti-SKP2 and -p27 antibodies as described and revealed with fluorescein- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies as described (40Acosta J.C.

The cells were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) with DAPI to visualize nuclei. The cells (3 × 106) were electroporated with an Amaxa electroporator and Mirus Ingenio (Mirus Bio LLC) transfection reagent. KmycJ cells were transfected with 3 μg of the −1148-SKP2 promoter (46Huang Y.C. Hung W.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 209: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or pGL3basic vector (Promega) as control. K562 or KmycJ cells were nucleofected with 1.5 μg of 4×Ebox-Luc or the MYC-unresponsive 4×EboxMut-Luc reporter constructs (47Kiessling A. Sperl B. Hollis A. Eick D. Berg T. Chem.

The cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured in duplicate in a dual luciferase reporter gene assay system (Promega). The data were normalized to Renilla luciferase values (0.5 μg of pRL-TK vector in each transfection). Bone marrow mononuclear cells (prepared by Ficoll-Hypaque) from 4 healthy controls, 31 CML patients at diagnosis, and 8 patients that achieved the remission of the leukemia after treatment (Complete Molecular Response) (48Baccarani M.

The patients were from the Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla (Santander) and Hospital Universitario Dr. Negrín (Las Palmas). The study was approved by the ethics committees of both hospitals. We studied the MYC-SKP2 relationship in cell models in which (i) ectopic MYC expression is activated or induced and (ii) MYC induction does not stimulate cell proliferation, a critical condition to avoid SKP2 up-regulation subsequent to cell cycle progression. In the Kp27MER cell line, p27 can be induced with ZnSO4, and MYC can be activated with 4HT (Fig. 1A, top panel). Large scale gene expression profiling in these cells showed that MYC activation provoked up-regulation of SKP2 mRNA (40Acosta J.C. Ferrándiz N. Bretones G. Torrano V. Blanco R. Richard C. O'Connell B. Sedivy J. Delgado M.D. León J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 7286-7295Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We set out to validate this microarray data. Induction of p27 resulted in rapid growth arrest (Fig. 1A) and SKP2 expression was down-regulated (Fig. 1C), as predicted. Importantly, MYC activation did not modify p27-mediated growth arrest in this model (Fig. 1A), confirming previous results (40Acosta J.C. Ferrándiz N. Bretones G. Torrano V. Blanco R. Richard C. O'Connell B. Sedivy J. Delgado M.D. León J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 7286-7295Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). MYC activation (i.e. 4HT treatment) nonetheless resulted in a 2-fold increase in SKP2 mRNA in proliferation-arrested Kp27MER cells (Fig. 1B, black bars). Moreover, MYC activation induced robust up-regulation of SKP2 protein, as detected by immunoblot (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 3 and 4). The immunoblot also showed down-regulation of endogenous MYC following activation of ectopic MYC. This well known effect of ectopic MYC (49Penn L.J. Brooks M.W. Laufer E.M. Land H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 50Grignani F. Lombardi L. Inghirami G. Sternas L. Cechova K. Dalla-Favera R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3913-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) confirmed MycER activation by 4HT. In contrast to MycER-expressing cells, 4HT did not modify SKP2 expression in Kp27-5 cells, in which p27 is induced by Zn2+ but which do not carry the MycER allele (Fig. 1B). We used KMER4 cells treated with 1 μm imatinib, a BCR-ABL inhibitor that causes rapid down-regulation of endogenous MYC in K562 cells (51Gómez-Casares M.T. Vaqué J.P. Lemes A. Molero T. Delgado M.D. León J. Haematologica. 2004; 89: 241-243PubMed Google Scholar). MYC activation with 4HT in KMER4 cells did not rescue the proliferation arrest mediated by imatinib (Fig. 1D). Treatment of KMER4 with imatinib led to down-regulation of SKP2 mRNA, as detected by RT-qPCR (Fig. 1E), and protein, as detected by immunoblot (Fig. 1F). Activation of MYC in the presence of imatinib resulted in a 2-fold induction of SKP2 mRNA after 24 h (Fig. 1E) and protein (Fig. 1F, compare lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 3 and 4). Although BCR-ABL was previously reported to induce SKP2 (36Andreu E.J. Lledó E. Poch E. Ivorra C. Albero M.P. Martínez-Climent J.A. Montiel-Duarte C. Rifón J. Pérez-Calvo J. Arbona C. Prósper F.

Res. 2009; 33: 1520-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and to induce MYC (51Gómez-Casares M.T. Vaqué J.P. Lemes A. Molero T. Delgado M.D. León J. Haematologica. 2004; 89: 241-243PubMed Google Scholar, 53Xie S. Lin H. Sun T. Arlinghaus R.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7137-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), here we show that ectopic MYC up-regulates SKP2 in proliferation-arrested cells with inhibited BCR-ABL. The KmycJ cell line is a K562 derivative that bears a ZnSO4-inducible MYC allele (37Delgado M.D. Lerga A. Cañelles M. Gómez-Casares M.T. León J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1659-1665PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of K562 and KmycJ cells with 10 nm TPA resulted in growth arrest (Fig. 2A). TPA also induced a marked down-regulation of MYC, and as anticipated, SKP2 mRNA and protein expression were also repressed by TPA (supplemental Fig. S1). MYC induction did not rescue cells from TPA-induced growth arrest (Fig. 2A), confirming previous reports (54Lerga A. Crespo P. Berciano M. Delgado M.D. Cañelles M. Calés C. Richard C. Ceballos E. Gutierrez P. Ajenjo N. Gutkind S. León J. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 639-654PubMed Google Scholar). We induced MYC in KmycJ cells pretreated (12 h) with 10 nm TPA, i.e. when the cells had very low endogenous MYC levels. In these TPA-arrested cells, MYC induction with Zn2+ resulted in a notable increase in SKP2 mRNA, as assessed by RT-qPCR (Fig. 2B), and in protein, as determined in immunoblot (Fig. 2C). The results were similar when we used a different MYC-inducible K562 cell line (KmycB) (not shown). Finally, we assayed SKP2 induction by MYC in the KmycBp53 cell line. This is a K562-derived cell line bearing a p53 mutant that is activated at 32 °C and a Zn2+-inducible MYC transgene (41Ceballos E. Delgado M.D. Gutierrez P. Richard C. Müller D. Eilers M. Ehinger M. Gullberg U. León J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2194-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). MYC induction did not antagonize the p53-mediated proliferation arrest at 32 °C (Fig. 2D). We found that MYC induction with Zn2+ resulted in the increase of SKP2 mRNA (Fig. 2E) and SKP2 protein (Fig. 2F), despite the fact that the cells were growth-arrested by p53 at 32 °C. We conclude that MYC induction provokes SKP2 induction independently of cell cycle activation. To confirm the effects of MYC on SKP2 expression, we silenced MYC in K562 cells using siRNA. K562 cells were nucleofected with a short hairpin MYC vector (pRS-shMYC) (35Bernard D. Pourtier-Manzanedo A. Gil J. Beach D.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1724-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). MYC silencing was confirmed by immunoblot and was accompanied by down-regulation of SKP2 protein (Fig. 3A) and mRNA (Fig. 3B). MYC silencing also resulted in down-regulation of B23/nucleophosmin mRNA (a MYC target gene used as positive control) but not of SKP1 mRNA, which encodes another component of the SCFSKP2 complex used here as negative control (Fig. 2B). To confirm the effect of MYC on SKP2 expression in cell models other than K562, we studied SKP2 expression in P493-6 cells, a human lymphoblastoid cell line carrying a tetracycline-repressible MYC transgene (55Pajic A. Spitkovsky D. Christoph B. Kempkes B. Schuhmacher M. Staege M.S. Brielmeier M. Ellwart J. Kohlhuber F. Bornkamm G.W. Polack A. Eick D. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In these cells, doxycycline treatment led to rapid MYC down-regulation accompanied by down-regulation of SKP2 protein (Fig. 3C) and mRNA (Fig. 3D). We also tested TM1 cells, a mink lung epithelial cell line also carrying a tet-off human MYC allele (42Warner B.J. Blain S.W. Seoane J. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5913-5922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In TM1 cells, doxycycline addition provoked MYC and SKP2 down-regulation (Fig. 3E), although the cells continued to grow (not shown). Finally, we used the Myc-null rat cell line HO15.19, which does not express MYC (43Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Adachi S. Sedivy J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1039-1048PubMed Google Scholar). We analyzed MYC and SKP2 expression after serum deprivation in Myc-null and parental cells (TGR1). SKP2 levels were much lower but detectable in Myc-null cells. In contrast to parental cells, however, there was little decrease in SKP2 levels in response to serum deprivation (Fig. 3F). We conclude that MYC is a major regulator of SKP2 expression in cells from different tissues and species. To assess whether MYC directly activated transcription of the SKP2 gene, we performed the induction experiments in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) using Kp27MER cells, in which MYC can be activated with 4HT and p27 can be induced by ZnSO4. The cells were pretreated with 10 nm TPA (12 h) to down-regulate endogenous MYC and then treated with 10 μg/ml CHX for different periods. CHX effectiveness was confirmed by lack of induction of p27 protein in response to Zn2+ (Fig. 4A, compare p27 in lanes 1 and 2 versus lanes 3 and 4 in the absence of 4HT and lanes 5 and 6 versus lanes 7 and 8 in its presence). As predicted, endogenous MYC showed a high degradation rate. MycER was more stable in presence of 4HT (Fig. 4A, compare MycER levels in lanes 9 and 10 versus lanes 11 and 12), although the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. In sharp contrast, we found that SKP2 was a long-lived protein (>6 h). SKP2 mRNA levels were determined by RT-qPCR. The results showed that 4HT activation of MycER led to increased SKP2 mRNA levels, even in the absence of synthesis of new proteins; this was probably dependent on the MycER activated by 4HT (Fig. 4B). Both MYC and MycER protein levels were very low after 6 h of CHX treatment, precluding analysis of SKP2 mRNA expression at longer treatment times. We tested the ability of MYC to activate the human SKP2 promoter through promoter-luciferase assays. We transfected KmycJ cells with a luciferase reporter containing 1148 bp of SKP2 promoter (46Huang Y.C. Hung W.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 209: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The results showed that the SKP2 promoter was activated by MYC (Fig. 5A, top panel). Consistent with MYC repression by TPA, MYC transactivation activity was reduced in TPA-treated cells after transfection and was elevated when MYC was induced by Zn2+. As a positive control, we used a luciferase reporter bearing four E-boxes (4×Ebox-Luc), which was also activated by MYC (Fig. 5A, bottom panel). The empty luciferase construct and the reporter with four mutated E-boxes (4×EboxMut-Luc) were used for normalization. These results suggested that SKP2 could be a direct MYC target g"
https://openalex.org/W2302039093,"The c-Myc transcription factor activates a cascade of downstream targets to form a complex transcriptional program that ultimately leads to cellular transformation. Although a large number of protein-encoding genes as well as non-coding RNAs were identified as Myc targets, only a few have been validated to be functionally important for c-Myc-driven transformation. Here, we identify a microRNA (miRNA), miR-378, as a novel target of the c-Myc oncoprotein that is able to cooperate with activated Ras or HER2 to promote cellular transformation. Mechanistically, miR-378 achieves this oncogenic effect, at least in part, by targeting and inhibiting the anti-proliferative BTG family member, TOB2, which is further elucidated as a candidate tumor suppressor to transcriptionally repress proto-oncogene cyclin D1. Therefore, our study identifies miR-378-TOB2-cyclin D1 as a functional module to mediate the cross talk between Myc and Ras signaling in cellular transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2078748685,"Axin, a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, is a key scaffold protein for the β-catenin destruction complex. It has been previously shown that multiple post-translational modification enzymes regulate the level of Axin. Here, we provide evidence that protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) directly interacts with and methylates the 378th arginine residue of Axin both in vitro and in vivo. We found that the transient expression of PRMT1 led to an increased level of Axin and that knockdown of endogenous PRMT1 by short hairpin RNA reduced the level of Axin. These results suggest that methylation by PRMT1 enhanced the stability of Axin. Methylation of Axin by PRMT1 also seemingly enhanced the interaction between Axin and glycogen synthase kinase 3β, leading to decreased ubiquitination of Axin. Consistent with the role of PRMT1 in the regulation of Axin, knockdown of PRMT1 enhanced the level of cytoplasmic β-catenin as well as β-catenin-dependent transcription activity. In summary, we show that the methylation of Axin occurred in vivo and controlled the stability of Axin. Therefore, methylation of Axin by PRMT1 may serve as a finely tuned regulation mechanism for Wnt/β-catenin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2142395008,"Mucolipin-3 (MCOLN3) is a pH-regulated Ca(2+) channel that localizes to the endosomal pathway. Gain-of-function mutation in MCOLN3 causes the varitint-waddler (Va) phenotype in mice, which is characterized by hearing loss, vestibular dysfunction, and coat color dilution. The Va phenotype results from a punctual mutation (A419P) in the pore region of MCOLN3 that locks the channel in an open conformation causing massive entry of Ca(2+) inside cells and inducing cell death by apoptosis. Overexpression of wild-type MCOLN3 produces severe alterations of the endosomal pathway, including enlargement and clustering of endosomes, delayed EGF receptor degradation, and impaired autophagosome maturation, thus suggesting that MCOLN3 plays an important role in the regulation of endosomal function. To understand better the physiological role of MCOLN3, we inhibited MCOLN3 function by expression of a channel-dead dominant negative mutant (458DD/KK) or by knockdown of endogenous MCOLN3. Remarkably, we found that impairment of MCOLN3 activity caused a significant accumulation of luminal Ca(2+) in endosomes. This accumulation led to severe defects in endosomal acidification as well as to increased endosomal fusion. Our findings reveal a prominent role for MCOLN3 in regulating Ca(2+) homeostasis at the endosomal pathway and confirm the importance of luminal Ca(2+) for proper acidification and membrane fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2024494768,"Cyclophilin A (CyPA) is a ubiquitously distributed peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) that possesses diverse biological functions. Extracellular CyPA is a potent chemokine, which can directly induce leukocyte chemotaxis and contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammation-mediated diseases. Although it has been identified that the chemotaxis activity of CyPA is mediated through its cell surface signaling receptor CD147, the role of CyPA PPIase activity in this process is disputable, and the underlying molecular mechanism is still poorly understood. In this study, we present the first evidence that CyPA induces leukocyte chemotaxis through a direct binding with the ectodomain of CD147 (CD147ECT), independent of its PPIase activity. Although NMR study indicates that the CD147ECT binding site on CyPA overlaps with the PPIase active site, the PPIase inactive mutant CyPAR55A exhibits similar CD147ECT binding ability and chemotaxis activity to those of CyPAWT. Furthermore, we have identified three key residues of CyPA involved in CD147ECT binding and found that mutations H70A, T107A, and R69A result in similar levels of reduction in CD147ECT binding ability and chemotaxis activity for CyPA, without affecting the PPIase activity.

Leukocyte trafficking and recruitment are critical processes and essential aspects in host immune surveillance as well as for inflammation-mediated pathology. Although chemokines are the main regulators of leukocyte trafficking, extracellular cyclophilins have been shown to have potent chemoattractant properties for human leukocytes (1Arora K. Gwinn W.M.

Many structures of free CyPA and CyPA complexes with interacting molecules, such as CsA or CsA variants, substrate peptides, as well as the HIV-1 capsid protein, have been determined (7Ke H. Huai Q. Front Biosci. 2004; 9: 2285-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The structure of CyPA is composed of eight strands of antiparallel β-sheets in a flattened β-barrel with two helices capping the top and bottom. A shallow pocket on the barrel surface, constituting residues Arg-55, Phe-60, Met-61, Gln-63, Phe-113, Trp-121, Leu-122, and His-126, is the PPIase active site, and Arg-55 was identified to be a crucial catalytic residue.

Cancer. 2006; 106: 2284-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In addition, the cell surface expression of CD147 was reported to be regulated by the cytosolic CyPA (23Yurchenko V. Pushkarsky T. Li J.H. Dai W.W. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17013-17019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms of CyPA/CD147 interaction may have profound therapeutic value with respect to therapies for inflammation and viral infection (24Obchoei S. Wongkhan S. Wongkham C. Li M. Yao Q. Chen C. Med. Sci. Monit. 2009; 15: RA221-RA232PubMed Google Scholar, 25Yurchenko V. Constant S. Bukrinsky M.

Immunol. 2010; 160: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). So far, the molecular mechanism of CyPA/CD147 interaction is still poorly understood. Two CyPA-responsive sites on CD147 have been identified. It was first reported that residues Pro-180 and Gly-181 in the ectodomain of CD147 are critical for the signaling and chemotaxis induced via CyPA. The PPIase activity of CyPA was suggested to be crucial for the CyPA/CD147 interaction responsible for chemotaxis as CyPAH126A and CyPAF60A mutants with less than 1% of the wild-type (WT) CyPA catalytic efficiency failed to initiate the signaling event of chemotaxis (15Yurchenko V. Zybarth G. O'Connor M. Dai W.W. Franchin G. Hao T. Guo H. Hung H.C. Toole B. Gallay P. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22959-22965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). It was later reported that the cell surface expression of CD147 correlates with the capacity of its transmembrane domain to interact with CyPA. Residue Pro-211 in the transmembrane domain of CD147, instead of residue Pro-180 in the ectodomain, was found to be critical for this interaction (23Yurchenko V. Pushkarsky T. Li J.H. Dai W.W. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17013-17019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that CyPA can catalyze the isomerization of Pro-211 but not Pro-180 in vitro (27Schlegel J. Redzic J.S. Porter C.C. Yurchenko V. Bukrinsky M. Labeikovsky W. Armstrong G.S. Zhang F. Isern N.G. DeGregori J. Hodges R. Eisenmesser E.Z. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 391: 518-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mechanism of the signal transduction attributable to extracellular interaction between CD147 and its ligand, secreted CyPA, remains unclear. Here, we report that the ectodomain of CD147 (CD147ECT) can directly interact with CyPA, which should be responsible for the leukocyte chemotaxis induced by CyPA. We found that the CD147ECT binding site on CyPA overlaps with the PPIase active site and the CsA binding site, but the chemotaxis activity of CyPA is unrelated to its PPIase activity. The cDNA fragment encoding human CyPA was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-CGGCATATGGTCAACCCCACCGTGTTCTTCGAC-3′ and 5′-CCGCCTCGAG TTCGAGTTGTCCACAGTCAGC-3′, in which NdeI and XhoI restriction enzyme sites (underlined) have been added, respectively. The PCR product was doubly digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into the expression vector pET-32a+, with a C-terminal His6 tag introduced. The cDNA fragment encoding CD147ECT (residues 22–205) was amplified via PCR with primers 5′-GCGGAATTCATATGGCTGCTGGTACCGTTTTCACCACCGTTGAAG ACCTG-3′ and 5′-CAATACTCGAGGTGCGTGCGCACGCGGAGCG-3′, in which NdeI and XhoI restriction enzyme sites (underlined) have been added, respectively. The PCR product was doubly digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into the expression vector pGEX, which produces CD147ECT with a GST tag at the N terminus. CyPA site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using a QuikChange kit from Qiagen. These DNA constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. For protein expression, all plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3), respectively. For wild-type CyPA and its mutants, the bacteria were cultured to in LB medium at 16 °C until A600 reached 1.0, and isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to the culture to induce protein expression at a final concentration of 100 mg/liter. Cells were harvested 12 h later, resuspended in 50 mm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.0, and homogenized by sonication. The cell lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was loaded directly onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated in PBS (pH 7.0) with 10 mm imidazole and 300 mm NaCl. The target protein was eluted using PBS (pH 7.0) with 200 mm imidazole and was further purified by gel filtration with a Superdex 75 size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.0) with 50 mm NaCl using an ÄKTApurifier 100 system. Uniformly 15N-labeled protein was prepared by growing bacteria in minimal medium with 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen. For GST-fused CD147ECT, E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring the recombinant plasmid pGEX/CD147ECT were grown in LB medium at 18 °C until A600 reached 0.8, protein expression was induced with 100 mg/liter isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cells was harvested after 20 h of growth. GST-CD147ECT was purified from the soluble fraction using a Sepharose 4B-glutathione column (Amersham Biosciences) and subsequent gel filtration with Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.3). Expression and purification of untagged CD147ECT protein were as described previously (28Yu X.L. Hu T. Du J.M. Ding J.P. Yang X.M. Zhang J. Yang B. Shen X. Zhang Z. Zhong W.D. Wen N. Jiang H. Zhu P. Chen Z.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18056-18065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Chemotaxis assays (29Boyden S. J. Exp. Med. 1962; 115: 453-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar) were conducted with the neutrophil-like cell line, HL-60, in a 48-well modified Boyden chamber (Neuro Probe), with the upper and lower compartments separated by a polyvinyl pyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filter of 5-μm pore size (Neuro Probe). HL-60 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) in binding medium (serum-free RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin) were added into the upper compartments, whereas the binding medium containing 10 nm CyPAWT or CyPA mutants or medium alone (for random migration) was added to the lower wells. For chemokinesis control, 10 nm CyPAR55A was added to both the upper and the lower chambers. Anti-CD147 antibody (50 μg/ml) (BD Biosciences) was added to the cells in the upper chambers to investigate its effect. The chambers were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 90 min. The filter was then removed, fixed, and stained with Wright Giemsa (Sigma-Aldrich), and the number of HL-60 cells appearing on the bottom surface of the filter was counted under a microscope in at least four randomly selected fields for each well. Each experimental condition was assayed in triplicate wells. The chemotaxis cell number was calculated by deducting the average migrated cell number for the random migration control test from that for the CyPAWT or CyPA mutants. The relative chemotaxis ability of the CyPA mutant to CyPAWT was calculated by dividing the chemotaxis cell number of CyPA mutants by that of CyPAWT. All uniformly 15N-labeled CyPA NMR samples were in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) with 50 mm NaCl and 0.006% 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid in 90% H2O, 10% D2O plus Complete, an EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). All NMR experiments were performed at 298 K on a Bruker Avance 800-MHz NMR spectrometer (with CryoProbe). Two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded for uniformly 15N-labeled CyPAWT or CyPA mutants (0.2 mm) with or without CD147ECT (0.6 mm). All NMR spectra were processed with NMRPipe and analyzed using NMRView. An equal amount of the purified GST or GST-CD147ECT (1 μg) was applied to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube containing 0.1 ml of Sepharose 4B-glutathione beads suspension (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed with 600 μl of washing buffer (20 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.3). Then, 1 μg of purified CyPAWT or CyPA mutants was added. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed again four times using the washing buffer with protease inhibitor mixture. The beads were then collected and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer for Western blot analysis. Two primary antibodies, anti-CD147 and anti-His tag, were used to detect the GST-CD147ECT and CyPAWT or its mutants, respectively. Protein bands were visualized using the ECL Plus detection system (Amersham Biosciences) with HRP-conjugated secondary goat anti-mouse antibody. The protein amount was taken as the grayscale of each visualized band. The binding ability of CyPAWT or CyPA mutants toward CD147ECT was calculated as the proportion of CyPA protein amount to the corresponding GST-CD147ECT protein amount for each pulldown test. PPIase activity was determined in a coupled assay with chymotrypsin using the synthetic tetrapeptide succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-4-nitroanilide (Sigma) (30Moss M.L. Palmer R.E. Kuzmic P. Dunlap B.E. Henzel W. Kofron J.L. Mellon W.S. Royer C.A. Rich D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22054-22059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 930 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 50 μl of 200 μm solution of α-chymotrypsin were mixed in the spectrometer cell and preincubated at 0 °C for 10 min. Then 10 μl of 1 μm CyPA or mutant solution to be assayed was added, and after 5 min, the assay was initiated by adding 10 μl of a 7.8 mm solution of the peptide dissolved in 0.47 m LiCl in trifluoroethanol. The cis-to-trans isomerization of the Ala-Pro peptide bond, coupled with the chymotryptic cleavage of the trans peptide, was followed by the increase in absorbance at 390 nm for 40 s in a spectrophotometer. The temperature was controlled at 0 °C during the assay. The uncatalyzed cis-trans isomerization in the absence of CyPA was performed as a blank control, and the CyPA PPIase activity on CD147 engagement was performed with the addition of 10 μl of 2 μm CD147ECT to the reaction system. We first performed the in vitro chemotaxis assay to determine the chemotactic activity of wild-type CyPA (CyPAWT) and the inactive mutant CyPAR55A toward the neutrophil-like cell HL-60 using a Boyden chamber. Residue Arg-55 of CyPA is an essential catalytic residue, and the R55A mutation results in complete loss of the PPIase activity (31Zydowsky L.D. Etzkorn F.A. Chang H.Y. Ferguson S.B. Stolz L.A. Ho S.I. Walsh C.T. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1092-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The response of HL-60 cells to CyPAWT was dose-dependent and exhibited a typical bell-shaped curve with an optimal chemotactic dose of 10 nm (data not shown). When anti-CD147 antibody was added to HL-60 cells, the number of cells that migrated in response to CyPAWT decreased significantly (Fig. 1A), indicating that the chemotactic activity of CyPA is indeed due to the CD147 expression on HL-60 cells. Unexpectedly, we found that the CyPAR55A mutant displays similar chemotactic ability to CyPAWT, and the number of cells that migrated in response to CyPAR55A was about 90% of that for CyPAWT, at 10 nm. To control for chemokinesis, we conducted the experiment with CyPAR55A added into both the upper and the lower chambers at the same concentration, and the migrated cell number was about the same as that of the negative control group without CyPA (Fig. 1A). These results indicate that the PPIase function of CyPA is not critical to its chemotactic activity mediated by CD147. Because CD147 has been identified as the cell surface receptor of CyPA and it is essential for cyclophilin-mediated signaling (1Arora K. Gwinn W.M. Bower M.A. Watson A. Okwumabua I. MacDonald H.R. Bukrinsky M.I. Constant S.L. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 15Yurchenko V. Zybarth G. O'Connor M. Dai W.W. Franchin G. Hao T. Guo H. Hung H.C. Toole B. Gallay P. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22959-22965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), we next conducted the in vitro GST pulldown assay to examine whether the ectodomain of CD147 (CD147ECT, residues 22–205) is capable of directly interacting with CyPA. CyPAWT with a C-terminal His tag was incubated with GST-fused CD147ECT (GST-CD147ECT) bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. After washing extensively, proteins bound to the beads were analyzed with Western blot using anti-His tag and anti-CD147 monoclonal antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1C, CyPAWT does bind GST-CD147ECT, but not free GST as the negative control, indicating that there is a direct binding between CyPA and the ectodomain of CD147. We also performed GST pulldown assay to detect the binding between CD147ECT and CyPAR55A. The amount of CyPAR55A binding to GST-CD147ECT was about 90% of that for CyPAWT, suggesting that CyPAR55A also binds CD147ECT with a comparable affinity. Next, we used NMR spectroscopy to probe the interaction between CyPAWT and CD147ECT. Because protein backbone NH signals (cross-peak) in the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum are sensitive to nearby local chemical environment change, the binding of another protein will cause NH signal intensity or chemical shift changes for residues at the binding site. Therefore, the CD147 binding site on CyPA can be identified from the comparison of the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra of CyPA with and without CD147ECT. With the addition of unlabeled CD147ECT, some NH signals in the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of 15N-labeled CyPAWT became weaker or even disappeared, accompanied with small chemical shift changes (Fig. 2A). The decrease in NH signal intensity is most likely due to the intermediate NMR time scale conformational exchange for CyPA and CD147ECT binding, which results in line broadening of NMR signals. We calculated the NH signal intensity ratio for each residue of 15N-labeled CyPAWT with and without 3-fold unlabeled CD147ECT (Fig. 2B). Residues with over 2.8-fold intensity reduction include Ile-56, Gly-65, His-70, Gly-72, Ser-99, Ala-101, Asn-102, Ala-103, Thr-107, and Asn-108 (labeled in Fig. 2A), and residues Arg-55, Ile-57, Met-61, Gln-63, Gly-74, Gly-75, Lys-82, Leu-98, Gly-104, Gly-109, Ser-110, and Gln-111 also show significant reduction (1.8–2.8-fold) in NH signal intensities. By mapping these residues onto the crystal structure of CyPA, it is obvious that they are spatially clustered and mainly located at the area constituting the PPIase active site and two nearby loops consisting of residues 65–75 and 102–110 (Fig. 2C). This area should be the CD147ECT binding site on CyPA, and it also overlaps with the CsA binding site on CyPA. We thus examined the effect of CD147ECT binding on the PPIase activity of CyPA and found that CyPA does display dramatically lowered PPIase activity in the presence of CD147ECT (Fig. 2D), confirming that CD147ECT has an inhibitory effect on the PPIase activity, as does CsA. Analyzing structures of free CyPA and its complexes with peptide substrates or CsA revealed that most of the CyPA residues affected by CD147ECT binding are related to substrates and CsA binding or involved in structural packing, except residues His-70 and Thr-107. To determine whether this direct binding between CyPA and the ectodomain of CD147 is related to the chemotactic activity of CyPA, we mutated His-70, Thr-107, and Arg-69 (the residue preceding His-70) into alanine individually because the side chains of these three residues are known to be frequently involved in intermolecular interaction. Meanwhile, the side chains of the three residues are solvent-exposed and pointed away from the substrate and CsA binding sites on CyPA; thus mutations H70A, T107A, and R69A would not have a significant effect on the overall structure of CyPA. It has been reported that H70A mutation does not affect the PPIase activity of CyPA (32Eisenmesser E.Z. Millet O. Labeikovsky W. Korzhnev D.M. Wolf-Watz M. Bosco D.A. Skalicky J.J. Kay L.E. Kern D. Nature. 2005; 438: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar), and our enzymatic assay results also indicated that mutations R69A, H70A, and T107A have little effect on the PPIase activity of CyPA (Fig. 2D). We again employed the GST pulldown assay to study the effect of these mutations on the binding affinity between CyPA and CD147ECT. Indeed, all three CyPA mutants showed significantly decreased affinity toward CD147ECT as compared with CyPAWT. As shown in Fig. 1D, CyPAR69A only retains 30% of the binding ability for CyPAWT to CD147ECT, whereas CyPAH70A and CyPAT107A possess 54 and 45% of the CD147ECT binding abilities, respectively. Two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra of these CyPA mutants confirmed that the three point mutations do not cause a large change to the structure of CyPA as the spectra of the mutants are quite similar to that of CyPAWT and only NH signals of residues close to the mutated residue are affected by the mutations (supplemental Fig. 1). These results suggest that the side chains of residues Arg-69, His-70, and Thr-107 are mainly responsible for binding CD147ECT. We then carried out chemotaxis experiments for CyPAR69A, CyPAH70A, and CyPAT107A mutants and found that these mutants also displayed decreased chemotactic ability. At 10 nm, the chemotaxis cell number for CyPAR69A was 33% of that for CyPAWT, and the chemotactic abilities of CyPAH70A and CyPAT107A were reduced to 43 and 38% of that for CyPAWT, respectively (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that the residues Arg-69, His-70, and Thr-107 are also important for CyPA to function in the leukocyte chemotaxis, although they are not involved in the PPIase activity of CyPA, which confirms that the PPIase function of CyPA is unrelated to its chemotactic activity. It is interesting to note that the degrees of reduction in chemotactic ability for CyPAR55A, CyPAT107A, CyPAH70A, and CyPAR69A mutants correlate well with the degrees of reduction in the binding affinity with CD147ECT (Fig. 1E), strongly suggesting that the direct interaction between CyPA and the ectodomain of CD147 should be responsible for the chemotaxis activity of CyPA. Although it is well documented that extracellular CyPA induces the migration of leukocyte through its receptor CD147, the underlying mechanism is still poorly understood. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrate that the PPIase activity of CyPA is not related to its chemotaxis function because on the one hand, a PPIase inactive mutant CyPAR55A has a comparable chemotactic ability for the neutrophil as CyPAWT. On the other hand, we have identified CyPA mutations H70A, T107A, and R69A at the CD147ECT binding site that significantly decrease the chemotactic ability of CyPA without affecting its PPIase activity. So far, there are two well established mechanisms for CyPA to regulate the biological functions of its interacting proteins: (i) induce protein conformational change through catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of a prolyl peptide bond, as in the case of interleukin-2 tyrosine kinase and Crk (10Mallis R.J. Brazin K.N. Fulton D.B. Andreotti A.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 900-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 11Brazin K.N. Mallis R.J. Fulton D.B. Andreotti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell. 2007; 25: 483-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); and (ii) inhibit the phosphatase activity of calcineurin by forming complex together with CsA (33Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that CyPA can directly interact with the ectodomain of CD147, rather than interacting as an enzyme and a substrate, and our NMR data revealed that the CD147ECT binding site on CyPA overlaps with the PPIase active site and the CsA binding site of CyPA. The three mutations of the binding site residues, H70A, T107A, and R69A, reduced the binding affinity of CyPA for the ectodomain of CD147 and also decreased the chemotactic ability of CyPA to similar levels. Therefore, the PPIase activity-independent interaction between CyPA and the ectodomain of CD147 should be responsible for the leukocyte chemotaxis activity of CyPA. Our results are not in conflict with the previous observation that mutants CyPAH126A and CyPAF60A fail to initiate the signaling event of chemotaxis, whereas they have less than 1% of the CyPAWT catalytic activity (15Yurchenko V. Zybarth G. O'Connor M. Dai W.W. Franchin G. Hao T. Guo H. Hung H.C. Toole B. Gallay P. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22959-22965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In our NMR experimental data, NH signals of CyPA residues Phe-60 and His-126 are not significantly affected by CD147ECT binding. Analysis of CyPA structures suggests that the aromatic side chains of both residue Phe-60 and residue His-126 play a role in defining the conformation of the loop consisting of residues 118–125 (supplemental Fig. 2). Therefore, mutating either side chain into a methyl group may result in the loop collapse into the PPIase active site pocket, which thus possibly blocks the binding of peptide substrates or CD147. Two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled CyPAH126A and CyPAF60A are significantly different from that of CyPAWT with a large number of NH signals not overlapping (supplemental Fig. 2), strongly suggesting that mutations H126A and F60A have a much more broad impact on the structure of CyPA. Our finding is consistent with the previous results that the ectodomain of CD147 does not exist in an inherent cis-trans equilibrium dictated by a proline residue, and no peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerization catalyzed by CyPA for the ectodomain of CD147 was observed (27Schlegel J. Redzic J.S. Porter C.C. Yurchenko V. Bukrinsky M. Labeikovsky W. Armstrong G.S. Zhang F. Isern N.G. DeGregori J. Hodges R. Eisenmesser E.Z. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 391: 518-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Recently, more studies have started to reveal that CyPA can regulate biological processes independent of its PPIase activity (34Liu X. Sun L. Yu M. Wang Z. Xu C. Xue Q. Zhang K. Ye X. Kitamura Y. Liu W. Cell Microbiol. 2009; 11: 730-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 35Elbaz B. Valitsky M. Davidov G. Rahamimoff H. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 7634-7642Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). It was found that intracellular CyPA regulates influenza A virus infectivity through direct interaction with the virus matrix protein (M1) in a PPIase-independent manner (34Liu X. Sun L. Yu M. Wang Z. Xu C. Xue Q. Zhang K. Ye X. Kitamura Y. Liu W. Cell Microbiol. 2009; 11: 730-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Also, it was recently reported that CyPA is involved in the functional expression of Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), which can be inhibited by CsA, whereas the PPIase activity of CyPA is not mandatory (35Elbaz B. Valitsky M. Davidov G. Rahamimoff H. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 7634-7642Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Taken together, we speculate that it may be a general property for CyPA to regulate cellular processes through a novel PPIase-independent mechanism. Although CsA is a potent inhibitor of the PPIase activity of CyPs (36Kofron J.L. Kuzmic P. Kishore V. Colón-Bonilla E. Rich D.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6127-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), CsA derives not from inhibition of isomerase activity but rather from interruption of signaling events in complex with CyPA (37Walsh C.T. Zydowsky L.D. McKeon F.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13115-13118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our NMR data showed that the CD147ECT binding site on CyPA overlaps with both the PPIase active site and the CsA binding site (38Spitzfaden C. Braun W. Wider G. Widmer H. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 463-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and it is expected that CsA inhibits CyPA-induced chemotaxis by blocking the interaction between CyPA and the ectodomain of CD147 because of the high binding affinity of CsA to CyPA (Kd = 10−8-10−9 m). Therefore, CsA can block the direct interaction between CyPA and CD147. In addition, it can also block any function of CyPA involving the area that CsA binds. As CsA is a widely used tool in research on CyPA and other cyclophilins, our results illustrate that it is a common misunderstanding that the inhibitory effect of CsA is simply viewed as the effect of blocking the PPIase activity of CyPA (39Calhoun C.C. Lu Y.C. Song J. Chiu R. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2009; 320: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 40Zheng J. Koblinski J.E. Dutson L.V. Feeney Y.B. Clevenger C.V. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7769-7778Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In summary, our findings indicate that CyPA induces chemotaxis through a direct interaction with the ectodomain of CD147 in a PPIase-independent manner, suggesting that there exists a novel mechanism for CyPA to regulate cell signaling. Given its role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, the CyPA/CD147 interaction has been suggested to be an attractive target for therapeutic interventions. The fact that residues Arg-69, His-70, and Thr-107 of CyPA are critical for both CD147 binding and chemotaxis, but not for the PPIase activity, may hint at the possibility for developing novel anti-inflammatory drugs that selectively inhibit the chemotaxis activity without affecting the PPIase activity of CyPA. Further studies are needed to establish the roles of CD147 ectodomain in this cellular process and the detailed molecular mechanism for the function of extracellular CyPA, and thus to explore new therapeutic applications for CyPA.

We report here a comprehensive analysis of the effects of epothilone B, ixabepilone (IXEMPRATM), laulimalide, and peloruside A on CET conformation.

More importantly, the major mode of MT stabilization by MSAs is the tightening of the longitudinal interactions between two adjacent αβ-tubulin heterodimers at the interdimer interface. In contrast to previous observations reported with bovine brain tubulin, the lateral interactions between the adjacent protofilaments in CET are particularly strongly stabilized by peloruside A and laulimalide, drugs that bind outside the taxane site.

https://openalex.org/W2052814975,"Pancreas cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies and is characterized by activating mutations of Kras, present in 95% of patients. More than 60% of pancreatic cancers also display increased c-Src activity, which is associated with poor prognosis. Although loss of tumor suppressor function (for example, p16, p53, Smad4) combined with oncogenic Kras signaling has been shown to accelerate pancreatic duct carcinogenesis, it is unclear whether elevated Src activity contributes to Kras-dependent tumorigenesis or is simply a biomarker of disease progression. Here, we demonstrate that in the context of oncogenic Kras, activation of c-Src through deletion of C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) results in the development of invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) by 5–8 weeks. In contrast, deletion of CSK alone fails to induce neoplasia, while oncogenic Kras expression yields PDA at low frequency after a latency of 12 months. Analysis of cell lines derived from Ras/Src-induced PDA's indicates that oncogenic Ras/Src cooperativity may lead to genomic instability, yet Ras/Src-driven tumor cells remain dependent on Src signaling and as such, Src inhibition suppresses growth of Ras/Src-driven tumors. These findings demonstrate that oncogenic Ras/Src cooperate to accelerate PDA onset and support further studies of Src-directed therapies in pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1980337598,"The transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor (AR) is regulated by both ligand binding and post-translational modifications, including acetylation and small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)ylation. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are known to catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from both histones and non-histone proteins. In this study, we report that HDAC4 binds to and inhibits the activity of the AR. This inhibition was found to depend on the SUMOylation, instead of deacetylation, of the AR. Consistently, HDAC4 increases the level of AR SUMOylation in both whole-cell and cell-free assay systems, raising the possibility that the deacetylase may act as an E3 ligase for AR SUMOylation. Knock down of HDAC4 increases the activity of endogenous AR and androgen induction of prostate-specific antigen expression and prostate cancer cell growth, which is associated with decreased SUMOylation of the receptor. Overall, the studies identify HDAC4 as a positive regulator for AR SUMOylation, revealing a deacetylase-independent mechanism of HDAC action in prostate cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2059598052,"SmgGDS is an atypical guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that promotes both cell proliferation and migration and is up-regulated in several types of cancer. SmgGDS has been previously shown to activate a wide variety of small GTPases, including the Ras family members Rap1a, Rap1b, and K-Ras, as well as the Rho family members Cdc42, Rac1, Rac2, RhoA, and RhoB. In contrast, here we show that SmgGDS exclusively activates RhoA and RhoC among a large panel of purified GTPases. Consistent with the well known properties of GEFs, this activation is catalytic, and SmgGDS preferentially binds to nucleotide-depleted RhoA relative to either GDP- or GTPγS-bound forms. However, mutational analyses indicate that SmgGDS utilizes a distinct exchange mechanism compared with canonical GEFs and in contrast to known GEFs requires RhoA to retain a polybasic region for activation. A homology model of SmgGDS highlights an electronegative surface patch and a highly conserved binding groove. Mutation of either area ablates the ability of SmgGDS to activate RhoA. Finally, the in vitro specificity of SmgGDS for RhoA and RhoC is retained in cells. Together, these results indicate that SmgGDS is a bona fide GEF that specifically activates RhoA and RhoC through a unique mechanism not used by other Rho family exchange factors."
https://openalex.org/W1964047410,"K-ras mutations are associated with smoking-induced lung cancer and poor clinical outcomes. In mice, K-ras mutations are sufficient to induce lung tumors, which require phosphoinoside-3-kinase (PI3K) and further downstream, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation. However, the roles of individual Akt isoforms that link PI3K and mTOR are unknown. Here, we show that deletion of Akt1 but not Akt2 or Akt3 prevents lung tumorigenesis in a tobacco carcinogen-induced model and a genetic model. Akt1 deletion prevented tumor initiation as well as tumor progression, coincident with decreased Akt signaling in tumor tissues. In contrast, deletion of Akt3 increased tumor multiplicity in the carcinogen model and increased tumor size in the genetic model. Fibroblasts lacking Akt1 are resistant to transformation by mutant K-ras and stimulation by epidermal growth factor. Human lung cancer cells with mutant K-ras and diminished Akt1 levels fail to grow in vivo. These data suggest that Akt1 is the primary Akt isoform activated by mutant K-ras in lung tumors, and that Akt3 may oppose Akt1 in lung tumorigenesis and lung tumor progression. Given that Akt inhibitors in clinical development as cancer therapeutics are not isoform selective, these studies support specific targeting of Akt1 to mitigate the effects of mutant K-ras in lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2046929648,"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), which is transiently expressed during development of the central and peripheral nervous system. ALK has been recently identified as a major neuroblastoma predisposition gene and activating mutations have also been identified in a subset of sporadic neuroblastoma tumors. Two hot spots of ALK mutations have been observed at positions F1174 and R1275. Here, we studied stably transfected cell lines expressing wild-type or F1174L- or R1275Q-mutated ALK in parallel with a neuroblastoma cell line (CLB-GE) in which the allele mutated at position F1174 is amplified. We observed that the mutated ALK variants were essentially intracellular and were largely retained in the reticulum/Golgi compartments. This localization was corroborated by a defect of N-linked glycosylation. Although the mutated receptors exhibited a constitutive activation, the minor pool of receptor addressed to the plasma membrane was much more tyrosine phosphorylated than the intracellular pool. The use of antagonist monoclonal antibodies suggested that the constitutive activity of the mutated receptors did not require the dimerization of the receptor, whereas adequate dimerization triggered by agonist monoclonal antibodies increased this activity. Finally, kinase inactivation of the mutated receptors restored maturation and cell-surface localization. Our results show that constitutive activation of ALK results in its impaired maturation and intracellular retention. Furthermore, they provide a rationale for the potential use of kinase inhibitors and antibodies in ALK-dependent tumors."

However, the reasons why Brca1-deficiency leads to the development of cancer are not clearly understood. Activation of Akt kinase is one of the most common molecular alterations associated with human malignancy. Increased Akt kinase activity has been reported in most breast cancers. We previously found that downregulation of Brca1 expression or mutations of the Brca1 gene activate the Akt oncogenic pathway. To further investigate the role of Brca1/Akt in tumorigenesis, we analyzed Brca1/Akt expression in human breast cancer samples and found that reduced expression of Brca1 was highly correlated with increased phosphorylation of Akt. Consistent with the clinical data, knockdown of Akt1 by short-hairpin RNA inhibited cellular proliferation of Brca1 mutant cells. Importantly, depletion of Akt1 significantly reduced tumor formation induced by Brca1-deficiency in mice. The third generation inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), Palomid 529, significantly suppressed Brca1-deficient tumor growth in mice through inhibition of both Akt and mTOR signaling. Our results indicate that activation of Akt is involved in Brca1-deficiency mediated tumorigenesis and that the mTOR pathway can be used as a novel target for treatment of Brca1-deficient cancers."

Minion F.C. Gene. 1998; 214: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Several Mycoplasma species possess adhesins in gene families or multigene operons that display antigenic variation (11Baseggio N. Glew M.D. Markham P.F. Whithear K.G. Browning G.F. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1429-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12Dallo S.F. Baseman J.B. Microb. Pathog. 1991; 10: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Reddy S.P. Rasmussen W.G. Baseman J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5943-5951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of the currently described M. hyopneumoniae adhesins belong to the P97/P102 paralog family, with the exception of P159, which is nonetheless located immediately upstream of a P97 paralog. The mhp183 gene is expressed as a 125-kDa preprotein that undergoes a posttranslational cleavage event to create the functional 97-kDa protein P97 (14Hsu T. Minion F.C. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4762-4766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zhang Q. Young T.F. Ross R.F. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). P97 is directly involved in the adherence of M. hyopneumoniae to host respiratory cilia (9Hsu T. Artiushin S. Minion F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1317-1323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and contains two heparin-binding domains (8Jenkins C. Wilton J.L. Minion F.C. Falconer L. Walker M.J. Djordjevic S.P. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Heparin is a glycosaminoglycan able to inhibit adherence of M. hyopneumoniae to swine cilia in vitro (16Zhang Q. Young T.F. Ross R.F. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1616-1622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recruitment of heparin to the mycoplasmal surface provides a possible bridging molecule that may bind a range of extracellular matrix components, thereby increasing the potential of M. hyopneumoniae to colonize the host (8Jenkins C. Wilton J.L. Minion F.C. Falconer L. Walker M.J. Djordjevic S.P. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17Duensing T.D. Wing J.S. van Putten J.P. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4463-4468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, P97 is not exclusively responsible for adherence of M. hyopneumoniae, as binding to cilia is still observed when adherence via P97 is blocked (15Zhang Q. Young T.F. Ross R.F. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent research has uncovered several other proteins, including P159 (18Burnett T.A. Dinkla K. Rohde M. Chhatwal G.S. Uphoff C.

Of these, P159, P216, and Mhp271 are heparin-binding proteins (4Wilton J. Jenkins C. Cordwell S.J. Falconer L. Minion F.C. Oneal D.C. Djordjevic M.A. Connolly A. Barchia I. Walker M.J.

The host extracellular matrix contains several possible ligands for M. hyopneumoniae adherence (16Zhang Q. Young T.F. Ross R.F. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1616-1622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The extracellular matrix component fibronectin is often central to the adherence of pathogenic bacteria to host cells. Adherence to fibronectin may also trigger cytoskeletal rearrangements and host cell invasion (19Chaussee M.S. Cole R.L. van Putten J.P.M. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3226-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Girón J.A. Lange M. Baseman J.B. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 197-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fibronectin-binding domains have been identified in Mhp271 (7Deutscher A.T. Jenkins C. Minion F.C. Seymour L.M. Padula M.P. Dixon N.E. Walker M.J. Djordjevic S.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 78: 444-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and P116 (10Seymour L.M. Deutscher A.T. Jenkins C. Kuit T.A. Falconer L. Minion F.C. Crossett B. Padula M. Dixon N.E. Djordjevic S.P. Walker M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 33971-33978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The domain of P116 able to bind fibronectin also contains a C-terminal lysine that mediates adherence to plasminogen (10Seymour L.M. Deutscher A.T. Jenkins C. Kuit T.A. Falconer L. Minion F.C. Crossett B. Padula M. Dixon N.E. Djordjevic S.P. Walker M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 33971-33978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Plasmin(ogen) is present in both plasma and basement membranes; active plasmin is a serine protease capable of hydrolyzing extracellular matrix components including fibronectin, collagen, and laminin (21Dubreuil J.D. Giudice G.D. Rappuoli R. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Damage to cells by plasmin(ogen) can also expose extracellular matrix components, increasing the potential for adherence by a colonizing pathogen (22Scarselli M. Serruto D. Montanari P. Capecchi B. Adu-Bobie J. Veggi D. Rappuoli R. Pizza M. Aricò B. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). There is evidence that, like heparin, plasminogen may also function as a bridging molecule to contribute to bacterial attachment (23Pancholi V. Fontan P. Jin H. Microb. Pathog. 2003; 35: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). All of the proteins in the P97/P102 paralog family studied thus far have been characterized as adhesins. These exhibit a common mechanism of utilizing extracellular matrix components to contribute to the binding of host cilia by M. hyopneumoniae. An ability to recognize and adhere to components of the extracellular matrix is broadly applicable to a wide range of bacterial species, enabling bacteria to anchor to the host, thus establishing colonization (24Patti J.M. Allen B.L. McGavin M.J. Höök M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 585-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). A putative 120-kDa P97 paralog (Mhp107) is encoded by the gene mhp107. The contribution of P97 and related paralogs to adherence and colonization by M. hyopneumoniae is the basis for our interest in establishing whether Mhp107 is a member of this multifunctional adhesin family. This study utilized proteomic analyses to determine expression and surface location of Mhp107. Characterization of the binding of recombinant Mhp107 fragments to heparin, fibronectin, and plasminogen was undertaken. The ability of Mhp107 to interact with porcine kidney epithelial-like (PK15) cells and swine cilia was established, implying a role for Mhp107 in adherence and colonization of M. hyopneumoniae. M. hyopneumoniae strains were grown in Friis medium and harvested as described previously (25Scarman A.L. Chin J.C. Eamens G.J. Delaney S.F. Djordjevic S.P. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). M. hyopneumoniae strain 232 (26Bereiter M. Young T.F. Joo H.S. Ross R.F. Vet. Microbiol. 1990; 25: 177-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was used throughout this study unless stated otherwise. Additional strains of M. hyopneumoniae were isolated from various locations, including the laboratory-adapted strain J (25Scarman A.L. Chin J.C. Eamens G.J. Delaney S.F. Djordjevic S.P.

Forbes-Faulkner, Oonoonba Veterinary Laboratory, Queensland, Australia). Escherichia coli TOP10 or BL21 star (DE3) (Invitrogen) were grown on Luria-Bertani agar plates or cultured in Luria-Bertani medium with shaking at 200 rpm. Ampicillin was added to media at 100 μg/ml when required. Polymerase chain reactions used PfuUltratm High-Fidelity II DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and a cooled gradient palm cycler GC1–96 (Corbett Research, Australia). Primer sequences are provided in supplemental Table S1. Amplification of mhp107 from M. hyopneumoniae strain 232 chromosomal DNA and subsequent cloning using the pET151/D-TOPO® cloning kit (Invitrogen) to construct pET151:mhp107 was performed following the manufacturer's instructions. As TGA encodes tryptophan in M. hyopneumoniae, site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was performed to change in-frame TGA codons to TGG in the pET151:mhp107 construct. Regions of the pET151:mhp107 construct were then amplified and cloned using the pET151/D-TOPO® cloning kit to generate the recombinant polyhistidine fusion proteins described in this study (F1Mhp107-F3Mhp107). DNA sequencing was performed on the resulting recombinant plasmid constructs to ensure conformity to mhp107. Expression of recombinant proteins was in E. coli strain BL21 star (DE3). Recombinant plasmid constructs were transformed into this strain, and once cell growth reached an A600 of 0.8, protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Purification of proteins was performed under denaturing conditions using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Purified proteins were dialyzed into 0.01% SDS in PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, 137 mm sodium chloride, 2 mm potassium phosphate, 2.7 mm potassium chloride (pH 7.4)). Antisera against recombinant Mhp107 protein fragments were raised in New Zealand White rabbits with three injections of antigen at 2-week intervals, using a method described previously (8Jenkins C. Wilton J.L. Minion F.C. Falconer L. Walker M.J. Djordjevic S.P. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Serum was separated from clotted blood by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 10 min. The resulting serum was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min to pellet remaining red blood cells. Antisera were affinity-purified using the antigen protein bound to the nitrocellulose membrane according to Seymour et al. (10Seymour L.M. Deutscher A.T. Jenkins C. Kuit T.A. Falconer L. Minion F.C.

The method described by Cole et al. (28Cole J.N. Djordjevic S.P. Walker M.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 425: 295-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was utilized for Western blot analysis. Detection of Mhp107 expression by M. hyopneumoniae was undertaken using ESI-MS/MS analysis of M. hyopneumoniae proteins separated by SDS-PAGE of M. hyopneumoniae aqueous phase proteins. Extraction of the M. hyopneumoniae aqueous phase proteins using Triton X-114 was performed as described by Wise and Kim (29Wise K.S. Kim M.F. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5546-5555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with initial overnight cell lysis at 4 °C in 1% Triton X-114, 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. ESI 2The abbreviation used is: ESI, electrospray ionization. -MS/MS analysis was performed as described previously (10Seymour L.M. Deutscher A.T. Jenkins C. Kuit T.A. Falconer L. Minion F.C.

Chem. 2010; 285: 33971-33978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); identified peptides are detailed in supplemental Table S2. Immunoblot analyses were used in addition to ESI-MS/MS analysis to further elucidate Mhp107 expression. Immunoblots were performed with M. hyopneumoniae cell lysates, and aqueous phase proteins were probed with the purified polyclonal antisera. Immunoblot analysis was also employed to investigate variations in the expression and processing of Mhp107 among M. hyopneumoniae field strains. Immunoblots were performed using cell lysates probed with purified polyclonal antisera. The subcellular location of Mhp107 was identified using trypsin-treated intact M. hyopneumoniae as described previously (30Wilton J.L. Scarman A.L. Walker M.J. Djordjevic S.P. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1931-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Trypsin treatment was performed with trypsin concentrations of 0–150 μg/ml. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot with the purified polyclonal antisera; a control blot was probed with L7/L12, a ribosomal protein found in the cytosol (18Burnett T.A. Dinkla K. Rohde M. Chhatwal G.S. Uphoff C. Srivastava M. Cordwell S.J. Geary S. Liao X. Minion F.C. Walker M.J. Djordjevic S.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 669-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), to verify the integrity of M. hyopneumoniae cells following trypsin treatment. All immunoblot analyses were performed alongside negative control blots probed with affinity-purified preimmune sera. The ability of recombinant Mhp107 protein fragments to interact with heparin was assessed in microtiter plates based on the method described by Burnett et al. (18Burnett T.A. Dinkla K. Rohde M. Chhatwal G.S. Uphoff C. Srivastava M. Cordwell S.J. Geary S. Liao X. Minion F.C. Walker M.J. Djordjevic S.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 669-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Minor modification of this method included allowing 1 μg of recombinant protein to adsorb overnight in each well of 96-well plates (Nunc). Wells were blocked in 2% skim milk in PBS prior to 1.5-h incubation with 0–50 μg/ml biotinylated heparin (Calbiochem) with and without 1 mg/ml unlabeled heparin to determine the level of nonspecific binding observed in total binding results. Competitive binding assays were also performed according to Burnett et al. (18Burnett T.A. Dinkla K. Rohde M. Chhatwal G.S. Uphoff C. Srivastava M. Cordwell S.J. Geary S. Liao X. Minion F.C. Walker M.J. Djordjevic S.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 669-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Interactions of recombinant Mhp107 protein fragments with fibronectin and plasminogen were investigated on a Biacore T100 instrument (Biacore AB, Sweden). Preparation of recombinant proteins, ligand immobilization, and kinetics assays were performed as described previously (10Seymour L.M. Deutscher A.T. Jenkins C. Kuit T.A. Falconer L. Minion F.C.

Porcine plasminogen was purified using affinity chromatography (31Sanderson-Smith M. Batzloff M. Sriprakash K.S. Dowton M. Ranson M. Walker M.J. J. Biol.

The activity and purity of plasminogen was assessed with Spectrozyme PL (American Diagnostica, Inc.) (10Seymour L.M. Deutscher A.T. Jenkins C. Kuit T.A. Falconer L. Minion F.C. Crossett B. Padula M.

Fibronectin and plasminogen were used as the ligands in the surface plasmon resonance kinetics assays, and binding of recombinant Mhp107 proteins was performed over a range of concentrations (0–500 nm). Additional cycles were performed with 200 nm F1Mhp107 in the presence of 10, 50, and 100 μm ϵ-aminocaproic acid, a lysine analog, to determine whether lysine residues were responsible for the observed plasminogen binding. Analysis of F3Mhp107 association kinetics with fibronectin were determined as the sum of two exponentials for a heterogeneous surface as described by Deutscher et al. (7Deutscher A.T. Jenkins C.

All other binding data analysis used the 1:1 Langmuir binding model with BiaEvaluation software 3.1 (Biacore AB). The ability of recombinant Mhp107 fragments to promote binding to PK15 cells was determined using protein-coated microspheres. Coating of Fluoresbrite® polychromatic red polystyrene microspheres (Polysciences) was performed according to Seymour et al. (10Seymour L.M. Deutscher A.T. Jenkins C. Kuit T.A. Falconer L.

Briefly, PK15 cells were grown to confluence before varying periods of incubation with protein-coated microspheres. PK15 cells were washed, fixed, and stained before visualization by confocal microscopy. One-way analyses of variance with a Dunnett's comparison against results from BSA-coated beads were performed with GraphPad Prism version 4 software (GraphPad) to determine significance. The cilia-binding ability of recombinant Mhp107 fragments was investigated with an adherence assay used previously to identify M. hyopneumoniae adhesins. Microtiter plates were coated with purified cilia from tracheal mucosa of specific pathogen-free swine as described previously (16Zhang Q. Young T.F. Ross R.F. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1616-1622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mhp107 proteins were incubated with swine cilia, and bound protein was detected colorimetrically as described previously (4Wilton J. Jenkins C. Cordwell S.J. Falconer L. Minion F.C. Oneal D.C. Djordjevic M.A. Connolly A. Barchia I. Walker M.J. Djordjevic S.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 566-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in triplicate and repeated twice. Statistical analysis with an analysis of variance with a Tukey's comparison was performed. Wells containing no protein were used as negative controls. A cilia-binding protein, P159 (F4P159), (18Burnett T.A. Dinkla K. Rohde M. Chhatwal G.S. Uphoff C. Srivastava M. Cordwell S.J. Geary S. Liao X. Minion F.C. Walker M.J. Djordjevic S.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 669-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) was used as a positive control. The hypothetical protein Mhp107 (GenBanktm accession number AAV27416) is a P97 paralog encoded by mhp107. Mhp107 consists of 1032 amino acids with a predicted pI of 8.81. Analysis with SignalP 3.0 server identifies a signal peptide located between amino acids 1–34 with a probability of 0.952. Prediction by TMPred detects a transmembrane domain region between amino acids 17–33 with a score of 2408. MS/MS analysis of M. hyopneumoniae proteins extracted from an SDS-PAGE gel slice containing proteins in the mass range of 79–104 kDa detected peptides that mapped to Mhp107 (Fig. 1A), demonstrating expression of Mhp107. This observation corroborates evidence of in vivo transcription of mhp107 (6Adams C. Pitzer J. Minion F.C. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 7784-7787Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Attempts to express full-length Mhp107 in E. coli were unsuccessful (data not shown); consequently, Mhp107 was expressed as three distinct adjoining polyhistidine-tagged proteins (Fig. 1, B–C). Antisera raised against these fragments were used to characterize M. hyopneumoniae expression of Mhp107 by immunoblot analysis of the M. hyopneumoniae proteome (Fig. 1D). A 104-kDa protein was detected by antisera raised against each of the Mhp107 fragments. Immunoblot analysis did not indicate extensive proteolytic processing of Mhp107, despite extensive processing of other M. hyopneumoniae adhesins (10Seymour L.M. Deutscher A.T. Jenkins C. Kuit T.A. Falconer L. Minion F.C. Crossett B. Padula M. Dixon N.E. Djordjevic S.P. Walker M.J. J. Biol.

Immunoblots with Mhp107 sera recognized a ∼100-kDa Mhp107 protein in the M. hyopneumoniae field strains tested (Fig. 2A), showing that the expression of Mhp107 in vitro is common to M. hyopneumoniae strains isolated from distinct locations. Only minor differences in processing of Mhp107 were observed among the field strains. The cellular location of Mhp107 was investigated via trypsin treatment of M. hyopneumoniae cells. As a result of trypsin treatment, the 104-kDa protein recognized by Mhp107 antisera was observed to be degraded, suggesting that the protein is surface-located (Fig. 2B). As a control to confirm the integrity of M. hyopneumoniae cells throughout trypsin treatment, sera against the intracellular protein L7/L12 was used to confirm that L7/L12 remained intact (18Burnett T.A. Dinkla K. Rohde M. Chhatwal G.S. Uphoff C. Srivastava M. Cordwell S.J. Geary S. Liao X. Minion F.C. Walker M.J. Djordjevic S.P. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2045782182,"The sodium- and chloride-coupled glycine neurotransmitter transporters (GLYTs) control the availability of glycine at glycine-mediated synapses. The mainly glial GLYT1 is the key regulator of the glycine levels in glycinergic and glutamatergic pathways, whereas the neuronal GLYT2 is involved in the recycling of synaptic glycine from the inhibitory synaptic cleft. In this study, we report that stimulation of P2Y purinergic receptors with 2-methylthioadenosine 5'-diphosphate in rat brainstem/spinal cord primary neuronal cultures and adult rat synaptosomes leads to the inhibition of GLYT2 and the stimulation of GLYT1 by a paracrine regulation. These effects are mainly mediated by the ADP-preferring subtypes P2Y(1) and P2Y(13) because the effects are partially reversed by the specific antagonists N(6)-methyl-2'-deoxyadenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate and pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-6-azo(2-chloro-5-nitrophenyl)-2,4-disulfonate and are totally blocked by suramin. P2Y(12) receptor is additionally involved in GLYT1 stimulation. Using pharmacological approaches and siRNA-mediated protein knockdown methodology, we elucidate the molecular mechanisms of GLYT regulation. Modulation takes place through a signaling cascade involving phospholipase C activation, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production, intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization, protein kinase C stimulation, nitric oxide formation, cyclic guanosine monophosphate production, and protein kinase G-I (PKG-I) activation. GLYT1 and GLYT2 are differentially sensitive to NO/cGMP/PKG-I both in brain-derived preparations and in heterologous systems expressing the recombinant transporters and P2Y(1) receptor. Sensitivity to 2-methylthioadenosine 5'-diphosphate by GLYT1 and GLYT2 was abolished by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of nitric-oxide synthase. Our data may help define the role of GLYTs in nociception and pain sensitization."
https://openalex.org/W2006057301,"E26 transforming sequence-related gene (ERG) is a transcription factor involved in normal hematopoiesis and is dysregulated in leukemia. ERG mRNA overexpression was associated with poor prognosis in a subset of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Herein, a genome-wide screen of ERG target genes was conducted by chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip (ChIP-chip) in Jurkat cells. In this screen, 342 significant annotated genes were derived from this global approach. Notably, ERG-enriched targets included WNT signaling genes: WNT11, WNT2, WNT9A, CCND1 and FZD7. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of normal and primary leukemia bone marrow material also confirmed WNT11 as a target of ERG in six of seven patient samples. A larger sampling of patient diagnostic material revealed that ERG and WNT11 mRNA were co-expressed in 80% of AML (n=30) and 40% in T-ALL (n=30) bone marrow samples. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of ERG confirmed downregulation of WNT11 transcripts. Conversely, in a tet-on ERG-inducible assay, WNT11 transcripts were co-stimulated. A WNT pathway agonist, 6-bromoindirubin-3-oxime (BIO), was used to determine the effect of cell growth on the ERG-inducible cells. The addition of BIO resulted in an ERG-dependent proliferative growth advantage over ERG-uninduced cells. Finally, ERG induction prompted morphological transformation whereby round unpolarized K562 cells developed elongated protrusions and became polarized. This morphological transformation could effectively be inhibited with BIO and with siRNA knockdown of WNT11. In conclusion, ERG transcriptional networks in leukemia converge on WNT signaling targets. Specifically, WNT11 emerged as a direct target of ERG. Potent ERG induction promoted morphological transformation through WNT11 signals. The findings in this study unravel new ERG-directed molecular signals that may contribute to the resistance of current therapies in acute leukemia patients with poor prognosis characterized by high ERG mRNA expression."

https://openalex.org/W2142296573,"The copper-transporting P1B-type ATPases (Cu-ATPases) ATP7A and ATP7B are key regulators of physiological copper levels. They function to maintain intracellular copper homeostasis by delivering copper to secretory compartments and by trafficking toward the cell periphery to export excess copper. Mutations in the genes encoding ATP7A and ATP7B lead to copper deficiency and toxicity disorders, Menkes and Wilson diseases, respectively. This report describes the interaction between the Cu-ATPases and clusterin and demonstrates a chaperone-like role for clusterin in facilitating their degradation. Clusterin interacted with both ATP7A and ATP7B in mammalian cells. This interaction increased under conditions of oxidative stress and with mutations in ATP7B that led to its misfolding and mislocalization. A Wilson disease patient mutation (G85V) led to enhanced ATP7B turnover, which was further exacerbated when cells overexpressed clusterin. We demonstrated that clusterin-facilitated degradation of mutant ATP7B is likely to involve the lysosomal pathway. The knockdown and overexpression of clusterin increased and decreased, respectively, the Cu-ATPase-mediated copper export capacity of cells. These results highlight a new role for intracellular clusterin in mediating Cu-ATPase quality control and hence in the normal maintenance of copper homeostasis, and in promoting cell survival in the context of disease.

Menkes (MD) 2The abbreviations used are: MD, Menkes disease; WD, Wilson disease; BCS, bathocuproinedisulfonic acid; Cu-ATPase, copper-transporting P1B-type ATPase; MBD, metal binding domain; MRE, metal-responsive element. and Wilson (WD) diseases are genetically inherited disorders of copper metabolism. They illustrate the essential requirement for copper and the dire consequences of its dysregulation (1Danks D.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.M. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2211-2235Google Scholar). MD is an X-linked copper deficiency disorder that arises due to mutation of ATP7A (OMIM 309400). The primary site of the defect are the intestinal enterocytes, which take up dietary copper, but absorption into the portal circulation is impaired due to defective ATP7A-mediated copper efflux (2Monty J.F. Llanos R.M. Mercer J.F. Kramer D.R. J. Nutr. 2005; 135: 2762-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 3Nyasae L. Bustos R. Braiterman L. Eipper B. Hubbard A. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2007; 292: G1181-G1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Consequently, systemic copper deficiency accounts for the wide range of neurological and developmental defects (1Danks D.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.M. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2211-2235Google Scholar). WD is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper toxicity that results from mutation of ATP7B (OMIM 277900). Defective ATP7B-mediated biliary copper excretion leads to chronic copper accumulation in the liver and often in the brain. Patients develop liver failure and/or neurological symptoms such as movement disorders, seizures, and psychosis (1Danks D.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.M. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2211-2235Google Scholar). ATP7A and ATP7B are copper-transporting P1B-type ATPases (Cu-ATPases) and are key regulators of physiological copper status. They are large transmembrane proteins with six N-terminal metal-binding domains (MBDs). Each MBD comprises ∼70 amino acids, contains the highly conserved copper-binding motif GMXCXXC, and binds one copper ion. ATP7A and ATP7B carry out ATP-dependent copper translocation across cellular membranes for metallation of secretory cuproenzymes and for efflux of excess copper as a protective mechanism (reviewed in Ref. 4Lutsenko S. Barnes N.L. Bartee M.Y. Dmitriev O.Y. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 1011-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). ATP7A and ATP7B reside at the trans-Golgi network, where they receive copper from the copper chaperone ATOX1. With increased intracellular copper levels, ATP7A and ATP7B traffic to exocytic vesicles near the basolateral or apical membranes, respectively (2Monty J.F. Llanos R.M. Mercer J.F. Kramer D.R. J. Nutr. 2005; 135: 2762-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 3Nyasae L. Bustos R. Braiterman L. Eipper B. Hubbard A. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest.

Mercer J.F. Gastroenterology. 2006; 130: 493-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For both MD and WD, there is a high degree of clinical variability (7de Bie P. Muller P. Wijmenga C. Klomp L.W. J. Med. Genet. 2007; 44: 673-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 8Tümer Z. Møller L.B. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2010; 18: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). For MD, ∼170 different mutations in ATP7A have been reported, whereas ∼400 different mutations of ATP7B have been described (Human Gene Mutation Database). Although genotype/phenotype correlations have been difficult, it is generally accepted that the clinical expression of these diseases and patient response to treatment depends on the type of mutation in ATP7A/ATP7B, which in turn can affect the levels and activity of ATP7A/ATP7B, their post-translational modifications, protein-protein interactions, cellular localization, and/or ability to traffic in response to copper (7de Bie P. Muller P. Wijmenga C. Klomp L.W. J. Med. Genet. 2007; 44: 673-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 8Tümer Z. Møller L.B. Eur. J. Hum.

For both MD and WD, there are reports of identical mutations, even among siblings, conferring variable clinical expression (10Borm B. Møller L.B. Hausser I. Emeis M. Baerlocher K. Horn N. Rossi R. J. Pediatr. 2004; 145: 119-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11Duc H.H. Hefter H. Stremmel W. Castañeda-Guillot C. Hernández A. Cox D.W. Auburger G. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 6: 616-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), thus implicating other factors in determining the clinical phenotype. Environmental factors and allelic variants of modifying genes may contribute to the diversity of patient symptoms and onset of disease. COMMD1 is a protein that is absent in Bedlington terrier dogs with a copper toxicosis syndrome similar to WD (12van de Sluis B.J. Breen M. Nanji M. van Wolferen M. de Jong P. Binns M.M. Pearson P.L. Kuipers J. Rothuizen J. Cox D.W. Wijmenga C. van Oost B.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Heterozygosity for a specific silent missense mutation in COMMD1 possibly resulted in an earlier onset of WD in patients with known ATP7B mutations (13Stuehler B. Reichert J. Stremmel W. Schaefer M. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Hence, COMMD1 may represent a modifier gene affecting the clinical presentation of WD (13Stuehler B. Reichert J. Stremmel W. Schaefer M. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Clusterin (Apolipoprotein J) was among the potential ATP7B-interacting partners identified previously in a yeast two-hybrid screen (14Lim C.M. Cater M.A. Mercer J.F. La Fontaine S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14006-14014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Clusterin is a 449-amino acid, heterodimeric glycoprotein that interacts with a variety of proteins. It is ubiquitously expressed and present in most body fluids with the highest expression in the brain (15Aronow B.J. Lund S.D. Brown T.L. Harmony J.A. Witte D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Clusterin has been implicated in pathological conditions in which oxidative stress plays a central role such as aging, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer progression (16Trougakos I.P. Gonos E.S. Free. Radic. Res. 2006; 40: 1324-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Based on its large repertoire of unrelated binding partners, it has been also implicated in diverse physiological processes such as lipid transport, cell differentiation, regulation of apoptosis, clearance of cellular debris, and stabilization of misfolded proteins (16Trougakos I.P. Gonos E.S. Free. Radic. Res. 2006; 40: 1324-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Both cytoprotective and cytotoxic roles for clusterin have been reported. Functionally, clusterin is similar to the small heat shock proteins with chaperone-like activity, binding to stressed and misfolded proteins (17Humphreys D.T. Carver J.A. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Wilson M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6875-6881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Much of the work on clusterin has focused on its role as an extracellular chaperone (18Wilson M.R. Yerbury J.J. Poon S. Mol. Biosyst. 2008; 4: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 19Wyatt A. Yerbury J. Poon S. Dabbs R. Wilson M.R. Adv. Cancer. Res. 2009; 104: 89-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), binding to exposed hydrophobic regions of proteins and maintaining them in a state competent for subsequent refolding by other chaperones, e.g. HSP70 (20Wyatt A.R. Yerbury J.J. Wilson M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21920-21927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Poon S. Rybchyn M.S. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Carver J.A.

Wilson M.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15953-15960Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the role of clusterin in regulating the activity of ATP7A and ATP7B and its participation in copper homeostasis. We demonstrated an interaction between clusterin and the Cu-ATPases that was modulated by oxidative stress and mutations in ATP7B that led to its misfolding. We further demonstrated that clusterin has a role in facilitating the degradation of misfolded or unstable ATP7B, and its overexpression and knockdown affected intracellular copper levels. Therefore, clusterin plays a key role in Cu-ATPase quality control, which is necessary for maintaining normal copper homeostasis and cell survival in the context of disease. Our findings support the possibility that clusterin gene (CLU) variations that affect its expression, function or efficiency could be one mechanism that underlies the variable clinical phenotypes of MD and WD. Given the emphasis on extracellular clusterin, the Cu-ATPases also serve as a valuable model for deciphering the role of intracellular clusterin in protein turnover. ATP7B cDNA constructs encoding WT ATP7B, ATP7B(MBD 1–6del), and ATP7B(MBD 3–5del), and N-terminal FLAG-tagged WT-ATP7B-FLAG and ATP7B-G85V-FLAG were generated previously (23Cater M.A. Forbes J.

Clusterin cDNA in pIREShyg1 (Clontech) was kindly provided by Saverio Bettuzzi (University of Parma). pTriEx/ATP7B-N was kindly provided by Svetlana Lutsenko (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). Clusterin siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon (catalogue no. L-019513-00-0005). The metal response element (MRE)-luciferase and Renilla reporter constructs were generated previously (25van den Berghe P.V. Folmer D.E. Malingré H.E. van Beurden E. Klomp A.E. van de Sluis B.

Shield K. Deal Y. Mercer J.F. Gastroenterology. 2006; 130: 493-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Human neuroblastoma M17 cells were cultured at 37 °C in Opti-Mem® reduced serum medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Where indicated, the growth medium was supplemented with 50–200 μm CuCl2, 50–500 μm bathocuproinedisulfonic acid (BCS), 50–500 μm D-penicillamine, 0.5–2 mm hydrogen peroxide, 2–10 mm diamide, 53 μm cycloheximide, 5 μm lactacystin, or 5 μm NH4Cl, prior to harvesting cells. HEK293T cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (25van den Berghe P.V. Folmer D.E. Malingré H.E. van Beurden E. Klomp A.E. van de Sluis B. Merkx M. Berger R.

Protein complexes were eluted with 1 m glycine, pH 2.0, neutralized in 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and analyzed by Western blotting together with ∼50 μg total protein extracts. Protein extracts were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the following antibodies: sheep anti-ATP7B (diluted 1/1000) (23Cater M.A. Forbes J. La Fontaine S. Cox D. Mercer J.F. Biochem.

To control for protein loading either mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin (diluted 1/5000) (Sigma) or rabbit anti-β-tubulin antibodies (diluted 1/5000) (Abcam) were used. FLAG-tagged proteins were detected using HRP-conjugated mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody (diluted 1/5000) (Sigma). Secondary antibodies used included HRP-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG (Millipore), rabbit anti-goat IgG (Sigma), and sheep anti-mouse IgG (Dako) (diluted 1/10,000). Proteins were detected using Immobilon Western HRP Substrate Peroxide Solution (Millipore), and the images were captured using the Luminescent Image Analyzer LAS-3000 (Fujifilm). Adult mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation, and the livers were harvested and frozen on dry ice. Liver tissue protein extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (26Tao T.Y. Liu F. Klomp L. Wijmenga C. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41593-41596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with the appropriate antibodies. The luciferase reporter assay was carried out essentially as described previously (25van den Berghe P.V. Folmer D.E. Malingré H.E. van Beurden E. Klomp A.E. van de Sluis B. Merkx M. Berger R. Klomp L.W. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells were seeded into a 96-well plate and transfected with the Renilla-luciferase and MRE-luciferase reporter constructs, then co-transfected with the pEBB-FLAG empty vector, pIREShyg1/clusterin, clusterin siRNA, pEBB/WT-ATP7B-FLAG, pEBB/WT-ATP7B-FLAG plus pIREShyg1/clusterin, or pEBB/WT-ATP7B-FLAG plus clusterin siRNA. After 24 h, the cells were either left untreated or treated with 150 μm CuCl2 (16 h). The cells were rinsed with PBS, harvested in passive lysis buffer (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and assayed by luminometry (Centro LB960, Berthold Technologies) using the Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay system (Promega) for firefly and Renilla luciferase activity. The relative light units were calculated by dividing firefly luciferase measurements by Renilla luciferase measurements. All values are expressed as fold induction relative to the pEBB empty vector control or pEBB/WT-ATP7B-FLAG incubations (set as 1). Copper in cell pellets of transfected HEK293T cells was measured as described (5Cater M.A. La Fontaine S. Shield K. Deal Y. Mercer J.F. Gastroenterology. 2006; 130: 493-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded into 25-cm2 flasks and transfected with 5 μg of plasmid DNA for 48 h. The medium was supplemented with 150 μm CuCl2 for the final 16 h, and then cell pellets were prepared for copper measurements. Copper in cell pellets was measured by inductively coupled plasma MS (UltraMass 700, Varian). Within each experiment, the average of triplicate determinations was used for comparisons. Unless otherwise indicated, data are reported as means ± S.E., where n = at least 3. Statistical analysis was carried out using Student's t test. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments using HepG2 cells verified the yeast two-hybrid data and showed that endogenous ATP7B and clusterin interact in mammalian cells (Fig. 1A). The anti-ATP7B antibody immunoprecipitated both ATP7B and clusterin, whereas an unrelated antibody anti-ZnT1, and preimmune serum did not precipitate either protein (Fig. 1A). The two bands sometimes observed in the clusterin immunoblots may represent different glycosylated forms of clusterin as it is known to be heavily glycosylated (29Kapron J.T. Hilliard G.M. Lakins J.N. Tenniswood M.P. West K.A. Carr S.A. Crabb J.W. Protein. Sci. 1997; 6: 2120-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the reverse experiment, an anti-clusterin antibody also was able to immunoprecipitate ATP7B and clusterin (data not shown). ATP7B-clusterin interaction in mouse liver was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments using a mouse anti-Atp7b antibody (Fig. 1B). Although clusterin was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen with the ATP7B N terminus as a bait (14Lim C.M. Cater M.A. Mercer J.F. La Fontaine S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14006-14014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), it also interacted with ATP7B lacking the N terminus (MBD 1–6del), and hence the interaction was not dependent on the MBDs (supplemental Fig. 1). When HepG2 intracellular copper levels were manipulated either by copper supplementation (CuCl2, 24 h) or chelation (BCS and D-penicillamine, 72 h) (Fig. 1, C and D, respectively), the degree of ATP7B-clusterin interaction increased in a dose-dependent manner. The additional lower molecular weight band detected in the ATP7B immunoblots likely represents a degradation product of ATP7B that was previously characterized (30Bartee M.Y. Ralle M. Lutsenko S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 5573-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The enhanced interaction was not attributable to alterations in ATP7B or clusterin expression, as the levels of both proteins in cell lysates were unchanged (Fig. 1, C and D). Therefore, intracellular copper levels influence ATP7B and clusterin interaction, with any variance from the basal level stimulating an increased interaction. Clusterin activity is initiated in response to cellular stresses (17Humphreys D.T. Carver J.A. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Wilson M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6875-6881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 20Wyatt A.R. Yerbury J.J. Wilson M.R. J. Biol.

Takayanagi M. Tsukahara H. J. Toxicol. Sci. 2009; 34: 229-236Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 32Rice R.H. Vidrio E.A. Kumfer B.M. Qin Q. Willits N.H. Kennedy I.M. Anastasio C. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2009; 181: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To determine whether the interaction is modulated directly by oxidative stress, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were repeated using HepG2 cells treated with either H2O2 (20 min) or diamide (15 min) (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively). Both oxidizing agents increased the ATP7B-clusterin interaction in a dose-dependent manner. The levels of hemoxygenase-1, a commonly used marker of oxidative stress, increased after treating the cells with H2O2, diamide, CuCl2, and BCS/D-penicillamine (Fig. 2C). These results suggested that both copper excess and deficiency enhance the interaction between ATP7B and clusterin through the generation of oxidative stress, rather than representing a direct copper-specific effect. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments carried out using the ATP7A-expressing M17 neuroblastoma cells revealed that clusterin also interacts with ATP7A (Fig. 3). Similar to ATP7B, this interaction was substantially increased when cells were exposed to fluctuations in copper levels (Fig. 3A) or to oxidative stress mediated by H2O2 or diamide (Fig. 3B). We investigated the possibility that clusterin interacts to a greater extent with misfolded, unstable ATP7B variants. We generated N-terminally truncated variants of ATP7B, which localized throughout the cell in a reticulated pattern, indicative of misfolded protein that is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (23Cater M.A. Forbes J. La Fontaine S. Cox D. Mercer J.F. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Retention in the endoplasmic reticulum is common for misfolded ATP7B variants (7de Bie P. Muller P. Wijmenga C. Klomp L.W. J. Med.

U.S.A. 1998; 95: 10854-10859Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis of CHO-K1 cells that expressed these truncated variants in which MBDs 1–6 (MBD 1–6del) or 3–5 (MBD 3–5del) were deleted (Fig. 4A), verified that these deletions caused temperature-sensitive instability (supplemental Fig. 2). To determine whether ATP7B instability influenced its interaction with clusterin, we investigated clusterin binding to the truncated ATP7B variants at both 30 °C and 37 °C (Fig. 4B). For the truncated variants, while their expression levels were increased at 30 °C compared with 37 °C, the amount of clusterin that co-precipitated with them was markedly decreased at 30 °C compared with 37 °C (Fig. 4B). We concluded that more clusterin binds to unstable than to stable ATP7B proteins. Previous studies suggested that clusterin both increases protein stability and targets proteins for degradation. To determine whether clusterin interaction with ATP7B provides stability or facilitates its degradation, we investigated the impact of clusterin overexpression on WT-ATP7B and a mutant ATP7B protein (ATP7B-G85V) derived by introducing a WD patient mutation (Human Gene Mutation Database) (Fig. 5). This mutant protein is unstable and localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, characteristic of a misfolded ATP7B protein (24de Bie P. van de Sluis B. Burstein E. van de Berghe P.V. Muller P. Berger R. Gitlin J.D. Wijmenga C. Klomp L.W. Gastroenterology. 2007; 133: 1316-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding clusterin and either WT-ATP7B (Fig. 5, A and B) or ATP7B-G85V (Fig. 5, C and D). Although there is slight variability in transient expression levels of clusterin between independent experiments, clusterin levels are clearly increased above endogenous levels, and the overall trends relating to its effects on ATP7B levels are clearly apparent. Levels of WT-ATP7B were decreased when clusterin was overexpressed compared with cells only expressing WT-ATP7B (Fig. 5, A and B, compare lanes 1 and 4). This decrease was more pronounced for ATP7B-G85V co-expressed with clusterin compared with ATP7B-G85V alone (Fig. 5, C and D, compare lanes 1 and 4). Clusterin co-expression in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide led to a further decrease in the level of ATP7B proteins (Fig. 5, A–D, lanes 4 and 5). We concluded that clusterin facilitates ATP7B degradation. To determine the involvement of the proteasomal and lysosomal degradation pathways, lactacystin and NH4Cl were used to inhibit these pathways, respectively. With lactacystin treatment, there was partial rescue of ATP7B-G85V levels but not WT-ATP7B(Fig. 5, A and C, lanes 2 and 3). With clusterin overexpression in combination with lactacystin treatment, there was no evidence of rescue but a further reduction in WT-ATP7B and ATP7B-G85V levels (Fig. 5, A and C, lanes 3 and 6 and lanes 5 and 6). We concluded that the proteasomal degradation pathway is unlikely to play a significant role in clusterin-facilitated ATP7B proteolysis. NH4Cl treatment also resulted in partial rescue of ATP7B-G85V levels both without and with clusterin overexpression, implicating the lysosomal pathway in clusterin-facilitated ATP7B degradation (Fig. 5D). A similar rescue effect was evident with WT-ATP7B but only when clusterin was overexpressed (Fig. 5B, lanes 4–6). The incomplete rescue (back to basal levels) was likely due to the fact that clusterin overexpression preceded NH4Cl treatment, so that ATP7B degradation was already underway before NH4Cl was added. These data confirmed that clusterin facilitates the degradation of misfolded ATP7B and indicated that the lysosomal pathway is likely to be involved in this clusterin-facilitated degradation of ATP7B. To determine whether clusterin levels affected intracellular copper levels, an MRE-luciferase reporter assay was employed (25van den Berghe P.V. Folmer D.E. Malingré H.E. van Beurden E.

https://openalex.org/W1988445910,"β-Interferons (IFN-βs) represent one of the first line treatments for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, slowing disease progression while reducing the frequency of relapses. Despite this, more effective, well tolerated therapeutic strategies are needed. Cannabinoids palliate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) symptoms and have therapeutic potential in MS patients although the precise molecular mechanism for these effects is not understood. Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling controls innate immune responses and TLRs are implicated in MS. Here we demonstrate that the synthetic cannabinoid R(+)WIN55,212-2 is a novel regulator of TLR3 and TLR4 signaling by inhibiting the pro-inflammatory signaling axis triggered by TLR3 and TLR4, whereas selectively augmenting TLR3-induced activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and expression of IFN-β. We present evidence that R(+)WIN55,212-2 strongly promotes the nuclear localization of IRF3. The potentiation of IFN-β expression by R(+)WIN55,212-2 is critical for manifesting its protective effects in the murine MS model EAE as evidenced by its reduced therapeutic efficacy in the presence of an anti-IFN-β antibody. R(+)WIN55,212-2 also induces IFN-β expression in MS patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells, whereas down-regulating inflammatory signaling in these cells. These findings identify R(+)WIN55,212-2 as a novel regulator of TLR3 signaling to IRF3 activation and IFN-β expression and highlights a new mechanism that may be open to exploitation in the development of new therapeutics for the treatment of MS."
https://openalex.org/W2088844201,"Transforming growth factor-β family cytokines have diverse actions in the maintenance of cardiac homeostasis. Follistatin-like 3 (Fstl3) is an extracellular regulator of certain TGF-β family members, including activin A. The aim of this study was to examine the role of Fstl3 in cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac myocyte-specific Fstl3 knock-out (KO) mice and control mice were subjected to pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Cardiac hypertrophy was assessed by echocardiography and histological and biochemical methods. KO mice showed reduced cardiac hypertrophy, pulmonary congestion, concentric LV wall thickness, LV dilatation, and LV systolic dysfunction after TAC compared with control mice. KO mice displayed attenuated increases in cardiomyocyte cell surface area and interstitial fibrosis following pressure overload. Although activin A was similarly up-regulated in KO and control mice after TAC, a significant increase in Smad2 phosphorylation only occurred in KO mice. Knockdown of Fstl3 in cultured cardiomyocytes inhibited PE-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated Fstl3 overexpression blocked the inhibitory action of activin A on hypertrophy and Smad2 activation. Transduction with Smad7, a negative regulator of Smad2 signaling, blocked the antihypertrophic actions of activin A stimulation or Fstl3 ablation. These findings identify Fstl3 as a stress-induced regulator of hypertrophy that controls myocyte size via regulation of Smad signaling."

We suggest that AMPK activation via PKC might be a general mechanism to regulate IRES-dependent translation in cancer cells. The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Src was the first proto-oncogene to be discovered in the vertebrate genome. c-Src is overexpressed and activated in many human cancers, including lung, skin, colon, breast, and ovarian malignancies. The elevated protein levels and catalytic activity have been linked to the development of cancer and progression to metastases. However, despite the fact that c-Src is one of the oldest and most investigated proto-oncogenes, the precise functions of c-Src in cancer remain unclear. In addition to increasing cell proliferation, a key role of c-Src in cancer seems to be to promote invasion and motility, functions that might contribute to tumor progression (for review, see Refs. 1Martin G.S.

The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) maintains the balance between ATP production and consumption in eukaryotic cells (for review, see Refs. 7Hardie D.G. Int. J. Obes. 2008; 32: S7-S12Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 8Hardie D.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). Mammalian AMPK is sensitive to the cellular AMP/ATP ratio and is activated by metabolic stresses such as hypoxia and glucose deprivation. AMPK is also modulated by cytokines that regulate whole body energy balance, including leptin and interleukin-6 (for review, see Refs. 7Hardie D.G. Int. J. Obes. 2008; 32: S7-S12Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 8Hardie D.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). AMPK is a conserved heterotrimeric protein comprised of a catalytic (α1 or α2) subunit and two regulatory (β1 or β2 and γ1, γ2, or γ3) subunits. Following binding of AMP to the γ subunit, AMPK is activated by LKB1, which phosphorylates AMPK at a conserved threonine residue (Thr-172) on the α subunit. This mechanism allows the system to act as a sensor of cellular energy status (for review, see Refs. 7Hardie D.G. Int. J. Obes. 2008; 32: S7-S12Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 8Hardie D.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). Upon activation, AMPK switches on catabolic pathways that generate ATP, such as the uptake and metabolism of glucose and fatty acids. AMPK also switches off anabolic pathways that consume ATP, but are not necessary for survival, such as the synthesis of fatty acids, glycogen, and proteins. Thus, AMPK plays a dual role in cancer. On the one hand, AMPK activates glycolysis and angiogenesis, promoting cell survival (7Hardie D.G. Int. J. Obes. 2008; 32: S7-S12Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 8Hardie D.G. Nat. Rev.

On the other hand, active AMPK also switches off anabolic processes, including protein synthesis, through the inhibition of mTOR (11Hahn-Windgassen A. Nogueira V. Chen C.C. Skeen J.E. Sonenberg N.

Previously, we found that AMPK activity increases during HPV16 transformation of human keratinocytes (4Mizrachy-Schwartz S. Kravchenko-Balasha N. Ben-Bassat H. Klein S. Levitzki A. PLoS One. 2007; 2: e628Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were intrigued to examine the status of AMPK in cancer cells. Here, we report that AMPK activity is high in several known cancer cell lines. We find that AMPK activation is regulated through c-Src, PLCγ, PKCα, and LKB1 in some of these cancer cell lines.

MCF7 (breast cancer) cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS. All media were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and all cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. A431 and OVCAR3 cells were transfected using DharmaFECT1 according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, for a 6-well plate 2 μm siRNAs in 1 × siRNA buffer were diluted into serum-free medium and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. 5 μl of DharmaFECT1 was diluted with 195 μl of serum-free medium, and after 5 min at room temperature the reagent was incubated with 2 μm siRNA for 20 min at room temperature. 1.6 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS was added to the siRNA·DharmaFECT1 complex and dropped onto the cells. 96 h after transfection, cells were harvested. At 60–70% confluence, cells were starved of serum for 2 h. The medium was replaced with medium lacking serum containing PP1, BIS1, rapamycin, AICAR, compound C, or U73122 and the cells were incubated further, as indicated. The protein content of cell lysates generated by nondenaturing detergents was quantified using the micro-Bradford assay (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with the Zor-Selinger modifications (14Zor T. Selinger Z. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Protein determination for denatured lysates was performed using the bound Coomassie Blue method: samples (5 μl) and BSA standards (1–10 μg) were spotted onto numbered 3MM filter paper strips (0.5 × 1.5 cm; Whatman). Filter papers were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (2.5 g/liter in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid; Bio-Rad), and unbound dye was washed with destaining solution (20% methanol, 7% acetic acid). Bound Coomassie was eluted by incubating the filters in 1 ml of 3% SDS at 37 °C for 1 h with shaking in a 24-well plate. 200-μl samples were transferred to a 96-well plate, and the absorbance of the eluted solution was measured at 595 nm in an ELISA reader. Cells were washed with PBS (50 mm NaH2PO, 50 mm Na2HPO4, 0.77 m NaCl), and denatured cell lysates were prepared by scraping the cells in the presence of Laemmli sample buffer (40% glycerol, 0.2 m Tris, pH 6.8, 20% β-mercaptoethanol, 12% SDS, and bromphenol blue) and boiling the samples for 10 min. Aliquots of cell extracts containing the same amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Sartorius). The membranes were blocked with TBS-T (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20) containing 5% low fat milk, incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, and then with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch) for 45 min at room temperature. After each incubation the membranes were thoroughly washed with TBS-T (four times for 3 min). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). For densitometric analysis, several exposures were made, and only subsaturation exposures were analyzed. Densitometry of immunoblots was performed with ImageJ 1.61 (National Institutes of Health) or EZQuant software. When needed, blots were stripped of antibodies by using Restore Plus Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's instructions, or by incubating in 2% SDS, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, at 55 °C for 20 min. After stripping, the blots were washed with TBST, blocked with 5% milk in TBST, and reprobed. The following antibodies were used: anti-ACC (catalogue no. 3602, dilution 1:1,000), anti-phospho-ACC-S79 (catalog 3661, 1:1,000), anti-AMPKα (2532, 1:1,000), anti-phospho-AMPKα-T172 (2531, 1:1,000), anti-phospho-c-Src-Y416 (2101, 1:1,000), anti-LKB1 (3050, 1:1,000), anti-phospho-LKB1-S428 (3051, 1:1,000), anti-PKCα (2056, 1:1,000), anti-phospho-PKCα-T638 (9375, 1:1,000), anti-PKCζ (9372, 1:1,000), anti-phospho-PKCζ-T410/403 (9378, 1:1,000), anti-PLCγ (2822, 1:1,000), anti-phospho-PLCγ-Y783 (2821, 1:1,000), anti-Hif-1α (3716, 1:1,000), anti-GAPDH (2118, 1:1,000) from Cell Signaling Technology; anti-ERK2 (sc-7383, 1:1,000), from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A431 and OVCAR3 cells were transfected with the bicistronic reporter construct (1 μg of DNA/well). 48 h after transfection the cells were treated for 4 h with AICAR or compound C (CC). After 52 h, cell lysates were prepared and assayed for firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activity.

The bicistronic reporter plasmid containing the 5′-UTR of HIF-1α and the pStemRhifF plasmid, which contains a hairpin before the SPL cistron, were kindly provided by Prof. G. J. Goodall (Adelaide, Australia) (17Lang K.J. Kappel A. Goodall G.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1792-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with the appropriate reporter plasmids, as above. At the time indicated, cells were harvested, and protein extracts were prepared by lysis with Reporter Lysis Buffer. FFL and SPL activities were assayed with a dual-luciferase kit using a Luminoskan Ascent (Thermo Labsystem) luminometer. For the bicistronic constructs containing the 5′-UTR of HIF-1α, FFL activity was normalized to SPL activity, to correct for transfection efficiencies. GST-tagged LKB1 was transfected and expressed in HEK293 cells and purified on glutathione-Sepharose as described previously (18Boudeau J. Baas A.F. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Kieloch A. Schutkowski M.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5102-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with GelCode blue stain reagent (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amount of purified protein was estimated using a BSA standard curve, which was loaded on the same gel. Increasing amounts of GST-LKB1 (10, 20, 40, and 80 ng) were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 60 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2, 3 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1.2 mm DTT, 20 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of active GST-PKCα (20 ng/reaction). The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer and the proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was subjected to autoradiography. Afterward, membranes were blocked with 5% low fat milk in TBST and reacted with anti-LKB1, anti-phospho-LKB1-S428 and anti-PKCα. For co-immunoprecipitation, the cells were lysed by scraping at 4 °C with lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 313 μg/ml benzamidine, and 0.2 mm AEBSF. Lysates were centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 10 min. Lysates comprising 0.5–1 mg of protein were used to immunoprecipitate c-Src and PLCγ1 from A431 and OVCAR3 cells. Antibodies against c-Src (mAb 327 or sc-208; Santa Cruz) or PLCγ1 (2822 from Cell Signaling or M156 from Abcam) were coupled to protein G-Sepharose (mAb 327) or A-Sepharose (sc-208, 2822 and M156) (Amersham Biosciences). 60 μl of protein A or G was coupled to 250 μl of α-c-Src (mAb 327) antibody (in medium) or to 2 μg of α-c-Src (sc-208) antibody by incubating them for 2 h at 4 °C. 60 μl of protein A was coupled to 1:50 diluted α-PLCγ (2822) antibody or 20 μl of α-PLCγ (M156) antibody by incubating them for 2 h at 4 °C. After coupling, the beads were washed five times with PBS to remove excess antibody. Lysates were incubated with coupled beads overnight at 4 °C on a rotating platform. Immunocomplexes were washed once with lysis buffer and five times with PBS, sample buffer was added to the beads, and the samples were boiled for 10 min before SDS-PAGE separation. To characterize AMPK regulation in transformed cells, we examined AMPK activity in a set of cancer cell lines, including A431, OVCAR3, HeLa, HT-29, MCF7, SKOV-3, T-24, and PC3 cells. We compared these cells with primary keratinocytes, which represent nontransformed cells of epithelial origin. The levels of the activated (phosphorylated) form of AMPK (Thr-172), as well as the phosphorylation of its direct substrate, ACC (Ser-79), were elevated in A431, OVCAR3, HeLa, T-24, MCF7, and PC-3 cells, compared with K cells, but not in SKOV-3 and HT-29 cells (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). In this study we conducted more detailed experiments on two of the cell lines: OVCAR3 and A431. c-Src is known to be activated in OVCAR3 and A431 cells (19Wiener J.R. Windham T.C. Estrella V.C.

Biochem. 1994; 225: 1047-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to investigate whether c-Src regulates AMPK activity in these cell lines. Inhibition of c-Src by its inhibitor, PP1 (21Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar), led to reduced activation of AMPK (as indicated by P-AMPKα) and reduced phosphorylation of its direct substrate, ACC, in both OVCAR3 and A431 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, siRNA-mediated depletion of c-Src using siRNA also resulted in reduced activity of AMPK in both cell lines (Fig. 2, C and D). Because previous studies demonstrated that the activation of AMPK is PKCζ-dependent (22Xie Z. Dong Y. Zhang M. Cui M.Z. Cohen R.A. Riek U. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Zou M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6366-6375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 23Xie Z. Dong Y. Scholz R. Neumann D. Zou M.H. Circulation. 2008; 117: 952-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), we tested whether PKCζ mediates AMPK activation by c-Src. Interestingly, the inhibition of PKC by BIS1 significantly attenuated AMPK activity (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). Nevertheless, PP1 treatment had no effect on the phosphorylation of PKCζ (Thr-410/Thr-403) (supplemental Fig. S2, C and D). Therefore, PKCζ is not the intermediate involved in the activation of AMPK by c-Src in these cells. However, the finding that BIS1 treatment led to AMPK inhibition (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B) implied that other PKC isoforms may be involved in the regulation of AMPK by c-Src. A connection between c-Src and PKCα had been reported previously in breast cancer cells (24Longo M. Brama M. Marino M. Bernardini S. Korach K.S. Wetsel W.C. Scandurra R. Faraggiana T. Spera G. Baron R. Teti A. Migliaccio S. Bone. 2004; 34: 100-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 25Tan M. Li P. Sun M. Yin G. Yu D. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of Src inhibition on PKCα in our cells. Treatment of A431 and OVCAR3 cells with the Src inhibitor, PP1, led to a reduction in the phosphorylated (activated) form of PKCα (Thr-638) (18Boudeau J. Baas A.F. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Kieloch A. Schutkowski M. Prescott A.R. Clevers H.C. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5102-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), in both A431 and OVCAR3 cells (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). Furthermore, siRNA against c-Src also led to a reduction in PKCα activation (supplemental Fig. S3, C and D). These results confirm that c-Src regulates PKCα in these cell lines. The phorbol ester, TPA, is known to activate PKC. Treatment of OVCAR3 and A431 cells with TPA resulted in increased phosphorylation of PKCα (Thr-638), as well as of AMPKα (Thr-172) and ACC (Ser-79) (Fig. 3, A and B). Furthermore, siRNA against PKCα led to reduced activity of AMPK in A431 and OVCAR3 cells (Fig. 3, C and D). Although the up-regulation of PKCα by c-Src has been shown previously, the mechanism of this activation remains unknown (25Tan M. Li P. Sun M. Yin G. Yu D. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recently, it was found that c-Src can be co-immunoprecipitated with PKCα from breast cancer cell lines (25Tan M. Li P. Sun M. Yin G. Yu D. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether such an association occurs in OVCAR3 and A431 cells. c-Src was immunoprecipitated with two different c-Src-specific antibodies, but Western blot analysis with c-Src and PKCα antibodies failed to show an interaction between PKCα and c-Src (data not shown). Thus, c-Src regulates PKCα in OVCAR3 and A431 cells, in an indirect manner. The initial step in the activation of PKC can be executed by PDK1 (26Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 27Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that the phosphorylation of PDK1 by c-Src is required for PDK1 activation (28Taniyama Y. Weber D.S. Rocic P. Hilenski L. Akers M.L. Park J. Hemmings B.A. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8019-8029Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 29Yang K.J. Shin S.

Chem. 2008; 283: 1480-1491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, we explored whether PDK1 mediates PKCα activation by c-Src in A431 and OVCAR3 cells. Depletion of PDK1 by siRNA in these cells had a minor effect, if any, on the activity of PKCα (supplemental Fig. S4). Therefore, we conclude that PDK1 is not a major player in transmitting the signal from Src to PKCα. Regulation of PLCγ1 by c-Src has been reported previously (30Shah K. Vincent F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5418-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 31Nozawa H. Howell G. Suzuki S. Zhang Q. Qi Y. Klein-Seetharaman J. Wells A. Grandis J.R. Thomas S.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2008; 14: 4336-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32Wang J. Taba Y. Pang J. Yin G. Yan C. Berk B.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and regulation of PKC isoforms by PLCγ1 has long been known (for review, see Ref. 33Martiny-Baron G. Fabbro D. Pharmacol. Res. 2007; 55: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether Src signaled to PKCα via PLCγ. Following immunoprecipitation of c-Src from A431 and OVCAR3 lysates, we observed a weak association between c-Src and PLCγ1 (Fig. 4, A and B). The reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation with anti-PLCγ1 antibody confirmed these results (Fig. 4, C and D). Interestingly, an antibody against an epitope in the N terminus of PLCγ1 precipitated c-Src (Fig. 4, C and D), whereas an antibody against an epitope in the C terminus failed (supplemental Fig. S5). In light of these results, we speculated that PLCγ1 mediates the activation of PKCα by c-Src. Inhibition of c-Src by PP1 or its depletion by siRNA led to a reduction in the phosphorylation of PLCγ1 at Tyr-783 (supplemental Fig. S6). Phosphorylation is one of the key mechanisms that regulate the activity of PLCγ1, and phosphorylation at Tyr-783 was reported to activate PLCγ1 (34Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). We also note that in SrcNIH cells, which are NIH 3T3 cells transformed with active Src (Y529F) (12Lin P.H. Shenoy S. Galitski T. Shalloway D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 401-405PubMed Google Scholar), the levels of phosphorylated PLCγ1 were higher than in the parental NIH 3T3 cell line. Moreover, PP1 strongly inhibited the phosphorylation of PLCγ1 at Tyr-783, in SrcNIH cells (supplemental Fig. S7). We next inhibited PLCγ using U73122 (35Kassis J. Moellinger J. Lo H. Greenberg N.M. Kim H.G. Wells A. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 2251-2260PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kayali A.G. Eichhorn J. Haruta T. Morris A.J. Nelson J.G. Vollenweider P. Olefsky J.M. Webster N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13808-13818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This led to a decrease in the phosphorylation of PKCα (Fig. 4E). Thus, the signal from c-Src to AMPK is transmitted via PLCγ and PKCα. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that AMPKα might be a direct substrate of PKCα. However, co-immunoprecipitation failed to detect an interaction between AMPKα and PKCα in OVCAR3 or A431 cells (data not shown). Previously, it had been shown that PKCζ activates AMPK through the serine/threonine kinase, LKB1. Following the phosphorylation of LKB1 at Ser-428, LKB1 is translocated from the nucleus to the cytosol, where it associates with AMPK and activates it (22Xie Z. Dong Y. Zhang M. Cui M.Z. Cohen R.A. Riek U. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Zou M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6366-6375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 23Xie Z. Dong Y. Scholz R. Neumann D. Zou M.H. Circulation. 2008; 117: 952-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether LKB1 also mediates the activation of AMPK by PKCα. We found that the inhibition of PKC by BIS1 caused a reduction in the phosphorylation of LKB1 at Ser-428 (Fig. 5, A and B), whereas the activation of PKCα by TPA led to increased phosphorylation of LKB at Ser-428 (Fig. 5, C and D). Furthermore, the depletion of PKCα by siRNA led to a marked reduction in the phosphorylation of LKB1. The inhibition of c-Src by PP1 or the depletion of c-Src by siRNA led to a reduction in the phosphorylation of LKB1 (supplemental Fig. S8). To examine whether PKCα directly phosphorylates LKB1, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using purified GST-LKB1 and active GST-PKCα, in the presence of MgATP and [γ-32P]ATP and then separated the reaction mixes by SDS-PAGE and transferred them to nitrocellulose. Autoradiography of the blot showed that in the absence of active PKCα, GST-LKB1 was not significantly phosphorylated. However, in the presence of active PKCα, [γ-32P]ATP was incorporated into GST-LKB1, and the degree of incorporated [γ-32P]ATP was proportional to the amount of GST-LKB1 in the assay. Furthermore, Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-LKB1 antibody showed an increase in Ser-428 phosphorylation of LKB1 (supplemental Fig. S9A). Thus, PKCα activates LKB1 in OVCAR3 and A431 cells. Inhibition of LKB1 using siRNA led to reduced phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC, but not of PKCα, indicating that LKB1 transmits the signal from PKCα to AMPK (supplemental Fig. S8E). Inhibition of Src using PP1 led to decreased phosphorylation of PLCγ, PKCα, LKB1, AMPK, and ACC (supplemental Fig. S9B). In light of these results, we conclude that c-Src regulates AMPK via PLCγ, PKCα, and LKB1 in OVCAR3 and A431 cells. AMPK plays a central role in the regulation of protein synthesis. It inhibits mTOR via the phosphorylation and activation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2). TSC2 is a subunit of the TSC1/TSC2 (hamartin/tuberin) complex which negatively regulates mTOR signaling. Thus, AMPK mediates the inhibition of cap-dependent translation (11Hahn-Windgassen A. Nogueira V. Chen C.C. Skeen J.E. Sonenberg N. Hay N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32081-32089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 37Dowling R.J. Zakikhani M. Fantus I.G. Pollak M. Sonenberg N. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 10804-10812Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that in the course of cell transformation a switch from cap to IRES-dependent translation occurred. This switch corresponded with the progressive activation of AMPK during transformation (4Mizrachy-Schwartz S. Kravchenko-Balasha N. Ben-Bassat H. Klein S. Levitzki A. PLoS One. 2007; 2: e628Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here, we examined whether AMPK can divert translation toward IRES-dependent translation in OVCAR3 and A431 cells. To this end we used a luciferase reporter system that utilizes reciprocal bicistronic plasmids from which both cap and IRES-dependent translation can be measured (15Ueda T. Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Fukuyama H. Nagata S. Fukunaga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6539-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In both cell lines, the activation of AMPK by AICAR (11Hahn-Windgassen A.

Chem. 2005; 280: 32081-32089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) led to an increase in IRES-dependent translation (supplemental Fig. S10, A, B, E, and F) and a reduction in cap-dependent translation (supplemental Fig. S10, C, D, G, and H). Correspondingly, the addition of the AMPK inhibitor, compound C (38Kim E.K. Miller I. Aja S. Landree L.E. Pinn M. McFadden J. Kuhajda F.P. Moran T.H. Ronnett G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19970-19976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), led to a decline in the IRES fraction. Interestingly, compound C treatment also reduced cap-dependent translation (supplemental Fig. S10, C, D, G, and H). To verify that we were indeed measuring IRES-dependent translation from the HIF 5′-UTR, and not read-through translation, we used the pStemRHifF plasmid (Fig. S10I), in which cap-dependent translation is strongly inhibited. The ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase activity was even higher from pStemRhifF than from pRhifF, indicating that cap-dependent translation of the Renilla luciferase was repressed and the firefly luciferase was read from the IRES site in the 5′-UTR (17La"
https://openalex.org/W2013199516,"Fbx4 is an F-box constituent of Skp-Cullin-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligases that directs ubiquitylation of cyclin D1. Ubiquitylation of cyclin D1 requires phosphorylation of both cyclin D1 and Fbx4 by GSK3β. GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of Fbx4 Ser12 during the G1/S transition regulates Fbx4 dimerization, which in turn governs Fbx4-driven E3 ligase activity. In esophageal carcinomas that overexpress cyclin D1, Fbx4 is subject to inactivating mutations that specifically disrupt dimerization, highlighting the biological significance of this regulatory mechanism. In an effort to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate dimerization, we sought to identify proteins that differentially bind to wild-type Fbx4 versus a cancer-derived dimerization-deficient mutant. We provide evidence that phosphorylation of Ser12 generates a docking site for 14-3-3ɛ. 14-3-3ɛ binds to endogenous Fbx4 and this association is impaired by mutations that target either Ser8 or Ser12 in Fbx4, suggesting that this N-terminal motif in Fbx4 directs its interaction with 14-3-3ɛ. Knockdown of 14-3-3ɛ inhibited Fbx4 dimerization, reduced SCFFbx4 E3 ligase activity and stabilized cyclin D1. Collectively, the current results suggest a model wherein 14-3-3ɛ binds to Ser12-phosphorylated Fbx4 to mediate dimerization and function."

Cyclin D1 (CycD1) is one of the most frequently amplified oncogenes in many types of cancers and it is also associated with the development of metastasis. Despite this, we still do not know which are all the relevant pathways by which CycD1 induces oncogenic processes. CycD1 functions can be either dependent or independent of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk4, and they affect several cellular aspects such as proliferation, cell attachment and migration. In this work, we reveal a novel function of CycD1 that fosters our understanding of the oncogenic potential of CycD1. We show that CycD1 binds to the small GTPases Ral A and B, which are involved, through exocyst regulation, in the progression of metastatic cancers, inducing anchorage-independent growth and cell survival of transformed cells. We show that CycD1 binds active Ral complexes and the exocyst protein Sec6, and co-localizes with Ral GTPases in trans-Golgi and exocyst-rich regions. We have also observed that CycD1-Cdk4 phosphorylates the Ral GEF Rgl2 'in vitro' and that CycD1-Cdk4 activity stimulates accumulation of the Ral GTP active forms. In accordance with this, our data suggest that CycD1-Cdk4 enhances cell detachment and motility in collaboration with Ral GTPases. This new function may help explain the contribution of CycD1 to tumor spreading."
https://openalex.org/W1964098109,"Angiogenesis is regulated by highly coordinated function of various proteins with pro- and anti-angiogenic functions. Among the many cytoplasmic signaling proteins that are activated by VEGFR-2, activation of PLCγ1 is considered to have a pivotal role in angiogenic signaling. In previous study we have identified c-Cbl as a negative regulator of PLCγ1 in endothelial cells, the biochemical and biological significance of c-Cbl, however, in angiogenesis in vivo and molecular mechanisms involved were remained elusive. In this study, we report that genetic inactivation of c-Cbl in mice results in enhanced tumor angiogenesis and retinal neovascularization. Endothelial cells derived from c-Cbl null mice displayed elevated cell proliferation and tube formation in response to VEGF stimulation. Loss of c-Cbl also resulted in robust activation of PLCγ1 and increased intracellular calcium release. c-Cbl-dependent ubiquitination selectively inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 and mostly refrained from ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Hence, we propose c-Cbl as an angiogenic suppressor protein where upon activation it uniquely modulates PLCγ1 activation by ubiquitination and subsequently inhibits VEGF-driven angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2042067791,"Factor XIII (FXIII) is a pro-transglutaminase found in the plasma as well as intracellularly in platelets and macrophages. Plasma FXIII is activated by thrombin cleavage (FXIIIa*) and acts in the final stages of blood coagulation cascade. In contrast, the function and activation of cellular FXIII are less characterized. Cellular FXIII relies on a conformational activation of the protein. The nonproteolytic activation of FXIII to FXIIIa° induced by Ca(2+) alone is well known, but up until now it has been discussed under which conditions the process can be induced and whether it can be reversed. Here, we study the nature of the Ca(2+)-induced FXIII activation. Previously used methods to evaluate FXIII activity detect both FXIIIa* and FXIIIa° because they rely on occurrence of enzyme activity or on active site Cys-314 solvent accessibility. Therefore, an analytical HPLC method was developed that separates zymogen recombinant FXIII (rFXIII) from rFXIIIa°. The data demonstrate that nonproteolytic activation and deactivation are highly dependent on Ca(2+) concentration, buffer, and salt components. Moreover, it is established that Ca(2+) activation of rFXIII is fully reversible, and only 2-5 mm CaCl(2) is sufficient to retain full rFXIIIa° activity. However, below 2 mm CaCl(2) the rFXIIIa° molecule deactivates. The deactivated molecule can subsequently undergo a new activation round. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that thermal stress of freeze-dried rFXIII can induce a new predisposed form that activates faster than nonstressed rFXIII."

NS oligomerization occurs in HL-60 leukemic cells and Raji B lymphoblasts that express high levels of c-Myc and have high intrinsic levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS); reducing agents dissociate NS into monomers and dimers. Exposure of U2OS osteosarcoma cells with low levels of intrinsic ROS to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induces thiol-reversible disulfide bond-mediated oligomerization of NS. Increased exposure to H2O2 impairs NS degradation, immobilizes the protein within the nucleolus, and results in detergent-insoluble NS. The regulation of NS by ROS was validated in a murine lymphoma tumor model in which c-Myc is overexpressed and in CD34+ cells from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis. In both instances, increased ROS levels were associated with markedly increased expression of NS protein and thiol-reversible oligomerization. Site-directed mutagenesis of critical cysteine-containing regions of nucleostemin altered both its intracellular localization and its stability. MG132, a potent proteasome inhibitor and activator of ROS, markedly decreased degradation and increased nucleolar retention of NS mutants, whereas N-acetyl-l-cysteine largely prevented the effects of MG132. These results indicate that NS is a highly redox-sensitive protein. Increased intracellular ROS levels, such as those that result from oncogenic transformation in hematopoietic malignancies, regulate the ability of NS to oligomerize, prevent its degradation, and may alter its ability to regulate cell proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2068782133,"In the present study we demonstrate an association between mammalian myosin Va and cytoplasmic P bodies, microscopic ribonucleoprotein granules that contain components of the 5'-3' mRNA degradation machinery. Myosin Va colocalizes with several P body markers and its RNAi-mediated knockdown results in the disassembly of P bodies. Overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of myosin Va reduced the motility of P bodies in living cells. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that myosin Va physically associates with eIF4E, an mRNA binding protein that localizes to P bodies. In contrast, we find that myosin Va does not play a role in stress granule formation. Stress granules are ribonucleoprotein structures that are involved in translational silencing and are spatially, functionally, and compositionally linked to P bodies. Myosin Va is found adjacent to stress granules in stressed cells but displays minimal localization within stress granules, and myosin Va knockdown has no effect on stress granule assembly or disassembly. Combined with recently published reports demonstrating a role for Drosophila and mammalian class V myosins in mRNA transport and the involvement of the yeast myosin V orthologue Myo2p in P body assembly, our results provide further evidence that the class V myosins serve an important role in the transport and turnover of mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1965919679,"The c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase (MetR) is frequently overexpressed and constitutively phosphorylated in a number of human malignancies. Activation of the receptor by its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), leads to increased cell proliferation, motility, survival and disruption of adherens junctions. In this study, we show that hTid-1, a DNAJ/Hsp40 chaperone, represents a novel modulator of the MetR signaling pathway. hTid-1 is a co-chaperone of the Hsp70 family of proteins, and has been shown to regulate a number of cellular signaling proteins including several involved in tumorigenic and apoptotic pathways. In this study we demonstrate that hTid-1 binds to unphosphorylated MetR and becomes dissociated from the receptor upon HGF stimulation. Overexpression of the short form of hTid-1 (hTid-1S) in 786-0 renal clear cell carcinomas (RCCs) enhances MetR kinase activity leading to an increase in HGF-mediated cell migration with no discernible effect on cell proliferation. By contrast, knockdown of hTid-1 markedly impairs both the onset and amplitude of MetR phosphorylation in response to HGF without altering receptor protein levels. hTid-1-depleted cells display defective migratory properties, coincident with inhibition of ERK/MAP kinase and STAT3 pathways. Taken together, our findings denote hTid-1S as an essential regulatory component of MetR signaling. We propose that the binding of hTid-1S to MetR may stabilize the receptor in a ligand-competent state and this stabilizing function may influence conformational changes that take place during the catalytic cycle that promote kinase activation. Given the prevalence of HGF/MetR pathway activation in human cancers, targeted inhibition of hTid-1 may be a useful therapeutic in the management of MetR-dependent malignancies."
