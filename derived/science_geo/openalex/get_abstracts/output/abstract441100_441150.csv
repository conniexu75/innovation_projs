https://openalex.org/W2097572487,"Panos Deloukas, Nilesh Samani and colleagues report a large-scale association analysis using the Metabochip array in 63,746 coronary artery disease cases and 130,681 controls. They identify 15 susceptibility loci, refine previous associations and use network analysis to highlight biological pathways. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the commonest cause of death. Here, we report an association analysis in 63,746 CAD cases and 130,681 controls identifying 15 loci reaching genome-wide significance, taking the number of susceptibility loci for CAD to 46, and a further 104 independent variants (r2 < 0.2) strongly associated with CAD at a 5% false discovery rate (FDR). Together, these variants explain approximately 10.6% of CAD heritability. Of the 46 genome-wide significant lead SNPs, 12 show a significant association with a lipid trait, and 5 show a significant association with blood pressure, but none is significantly associated with diabetes. Network analysis with 233 candidate genes (loci at 10% FDR) generated 5 interaction networks comprising 85% of these putative genes involved in CAD. The four most significant pathways mapping to these networks are linked to lipid metabolism and inflammation, underscoring the causal role of these activities in the genetic etiology of CAD. Our study provides insights into the genetic basis of CAD and identifies key biological pathways."

Part of this loss is because of the effects of warmer air temperatures, and another because of the rising ocean temperatures to which they are being exposed. Joughin et al. (p. 1172 ) review how ocean-ice interactions are impacting ice sheets and discuss the possible ways that exposure of floating ice shelves and grounded ice margins are subject to the influences of warming ocean currents. Estimates of the mass balance of the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica have differed greatly—in some cases, not even agreeing about whether there is a net loss or a net gain—making it more difficult to project accurately future sea-level change. Shepherd et al. (p. 1183 ) combined data sets produced by satellite altimetry, interferometry, and gravimetry to construct a more robust ice-sheet mass balance for the period between 1992 and 2011. All major regions of the two ice sheets appear to be losing mass, except for East Antarctica. All told, mass loss from the polar ice sheets is contributing about 0.6 millimeters per year (roughly 20% of the total) to the current rate of global sea-level rise."

We found that a functional polymorphism altering chromatin interaction between the transcription start site and long-range enhancers in the FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) gene, an important regulator of the stress hormone system, increased the risk of developing stress-related psychiatric disorders in adulthood by allele-specific, childhood trauma-dependent DNA demethylation in functional glucocorticoid response elements of FKBP5. This demethylation was linked to increased stress-dependent gene transcription followed by a long-term dysregulation of the stress hormone system and a global effect on the function of immune cells and brain areas associated with stress regulation. This identification of molecular mechanisms of genotype-directed long-term environmental reactivity will be useful for designing more effective treatment strategies for stress-related disorders."

Ke et al. (p. 1177 , see the cover; see the Perspective by Gothelf ) present an alternative approach to 3D assembly that builds upon modular assembly of 2D DNA tiles. One hundred and two distinct shapes were created from four-domain, 32-nucleotide single-stranded DNAs that assembled like children's blocks; each block could bind to four neighboring blocks through specific pairing interactions. Computer design and stepwise assembly allowed assembly of hollow shapes with a variety of internal cavities."
https://openalex.org/W2032566387,"A dome-shaped superconducting region appears in the phase diagrams of many unconventional superconductors. In doped band insulators, however, reaching optimal superconductivity by the fine-tuning of carriers has seldom been seen. We report the observation of a superconducting dome in the temperature-carrier density phase diagram of MoS(2), an archetypal band insulator. By quasi-continuous electrostatic carrier doping achieved through a combination of liquid and solid gating, we revealed a large enhancement in the transition temperature T(c) occurring at optimal doping in the chemically inaccessible low-carrier density regime. This observation indicates that the superconducting dome may arise even in doped band insulators."
https://openalex.org/W2146973661,"Establishing the age of each mutation segregating in contemporary human populations is important to fully understand our evolutionary history and will help to facilitate the development of new approaches for disease-gene discovery. Large-scale surveys of human genetic variation have reported signatures of recent explosive population growth, notable for an excess of rare genetic variants, suggesting that many mutations arose recently. To more quantitatively assess the distribution of mutation ages, we resequenced 15,336 genes in 6,515 individuals of European American and African American ancestry and inferred the age of 1,146,401 autosomal single nucleotide variants (SNVs). We estimate that approximately 73% of all protein-coding SNVs and approximately 86% of SNVs predicted to be deleterious arose in the past 5,000-10,000 years. The average age of deleterious SNVs varied significantly across molecular pathways, and disease genes contained a significantly higher proportion of recently arisen deleterious SNVs than other genes. Furthermore, European Americans had an excess of deleterious variants in essential and Mendelian disease genes compared to African Americans, consistent with weaker purifying selection due to the Out-of-Africa dispersal. Our results better delimit the historical details of human protein-coding variation, show the profound effect of recent human history on the burden of deleterious SNVs segregating in contemporary populations, and provide important practical information that can be used to prioritize variants in disease-gene discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2003553455,"Several of the thousands of human long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been functionally characterized; however, potential roles for lncRNAs in somatic tissue differentiation remain poorly understood. Here we show that a 3.7-kilobase lncRNA, terminal differentiation-induced ncRNA (TINCR), controls human epidermal differentiation by a post-transcriptional mechanism. TINCR is required for high messenger RNA abundance of key differentiation genes, many of which are mutated in human skin diseases, including FLG, LOR, ALOXE3, ALOX12B, ABCA12, CASP14 and ELOVL3. TINCR-deficient epidermis lacked terminal differentiation ultrastructure, including keratohyalin granules and intact lamellar bodies. Genome-scale RNA interactome analysis revealed that TINCR interacts with a range of differentiation mRNAs. TINCR-mRNA interaction occurs through a 25-nucleotide 'TINCR box' motif that is strongly enriched in interacting mRNAs and required for TINCR binding. A high-throughput screen to analyse TINCR binding capacity to approximately 9,400 human recombinant proteins revealed direct binding of TINCR RNA to the staufen1 (STAU1) protein. STAU1-deficient tissue recapitulated the impaired differentiation seen with TINCR depletion. Loss of UPF1 and UPF2, both of which are required for STAU1-mediated RNA decay, however, did not have differentiation effects. Instead, the TINCR-STAU1 complex seems to mediate stabilization of differentiation mRNAs, such as KRT80. These data identify TINCR as a key lncRNA required for somatic tissue differentiation, which occurs through lncRNA binding to differentiation mRNAs to ensure their expression."
https://openalex.org/W2080854581,"Nitrogen-rich heterocyclic compounds have had a profound effect on human health because these chemical motifs are found in a large number of drugs used to combat a broad range of diseases and pathophysiological conditions. Advances in transition-metal-mediated cross-coupling have simplified the synthesis of such molecules; however, C-H functionalization of medicinally important heterocycles that does not rely on pre-functionalized starting materials is an underdeveloped area. Unfortunately, the innate properties of heterocycles that make them so desirable for biological applications--such as aqueous solubility and their ability to act as ligands--render them challenging substrates for direct chemical functionalization. Here we report that zinc sulphinate salts can be used to transfer alkyl radicals to heterocycles, allowing for the mild (moderate temperature, 50 °C or less), direct and operationally simple formation of medicinally relevant C-C bonds while reacting in a complementary fashion to other innate C-H functionalization methods (Minisci, borono-Minisci, electrophilic aromatic substitution, transition-metal-mediated C-H insertion and C-H deprotonation). We prepared a toolkit of these reagents and studied their reactivity across a wide range of heterocycles (natural products, drugs and building blocks) without recourse to protecting-group chemistry. The reagents can even be used in tandem fashion in a single pot in the presence of water and air."
https://openalex.org/W2016708835,"Modeling the Brain Neurons are pretty complicated cells. They display an endless variety of shapes that sprout highly variable numbers of axons and dendrites; they sport time- and voltage-dependent ion channels along with an impressive array of neurotransmitter receptors; and they connect intimately with near neighbors as well as former neighbors who have since moved away. Simulating a sizeable chunk of brain tissue has recently become achievable, thanks to advances in computer hardware and software. Eliasmith et al. (p. 1202 ; see the Perspective by Machens ) present their million-neuron model of the brain and show that it can recognize numerals, remember lists of digits, and write down those lists—tasks that seem effortless for a human but that encompass the triad of perception, cognition, and behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2077116159,"Chronic infections strain the regenerative capacity of antiviral T lymphocyte populations, leading to failure in long-term immunity. The cellular and molecular events controlling this regenerative capacity, however, are unknown. We found that two distinct states of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells exist in chronically infected mice and humans. Differential expression of the T-box transcription factors T-bet and Eomesodermin (Eomes) facilitated the cooperative maintenance of the pool of antiviral CD8(+) T cells during chronic viral infection. T-bet(hi) cells displayed low intrinsic turnover but proliferated in response to persisting antigen, giving rise to Eomes(hi) terminal progeny. Genetic elimination of either subset resulted in failure to control chronic infection, which suggests that an imbalance in differentiation and renewal could underlie the collapse of immunity in humans with chronic infections."

Face recognition and processing are so completely central to human social interactions that these functions are supported by specialized regions in the brain. One of the fundamental aspects being processed is emotion, particularly whether the emotion being expressed is positive or negative. Nevertheless, neuroimaging studies have documented that perceiving opposite emotions often activates the same or overlapping regions. Aviezer et al. (p. 1225 ) report that the recognition of positive versus negative emotions actually relies on information communicated by the body—the extent to which perceivers identified joy versus grief in composite figures was driven by whether the body came from a joyous (versus grievous) image rather than the face."
https://openalex.org/W2051393353,"Mechanisms controlling the proliferative activity of neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) have a pivotal role to ensure life-long neurogenesis in the mammalian brain. How metabolic programs are coupled with NSPC activity remains unknown. Here we show that fatty acid synthase (Fasn), the key enzyme of de novo lipogenesis, is highly active in adult NSPCs and that conditional deletion of Fasn in mouse NSPCs impairs adult neurogenesis. The rate of de novo lipid synthesis and subsequent proliferation of NSPCs is regulated by Spot14, a gene previously implicated in lipid metabolism, that we found to be selectively expressed in low proliferating adult NSPCs. Spot14 reduces the availability of malonyl-CoA, which is an essential substrate for Fasn to fuel lipogenesis. Thus, we identify here a functional coupling between the regulation of lipid metabolism and adult NSPC proliferation."

The structure of the mature, active form of TbCatB has so far not provided sufficient information for the design of a safe and specific drug against T. brucei. By combining two recent innovations, in vivo crystallization and serial femtosecond crystallography, we obtained the room-temperature 2.1 angstrom resolution structure of the fully glycosylated precursor complex of TbCatB. The structure reveals the mechanism of native TbCatB inhibition and demonstrates that new biomolecular information can be obtained by the ""diffraction-before-destruction"" approach of x-ray free-electron lasers from hundreds of thousands of individual microcrystals."
https://openalex.org/W2071352397,"Cryptophyte and chlorarachniophyte algae are transitional forms in the widespread secondary endosymbiotic acquisition of photosynthesis by engulfment of eukaryotic algae. Unlike most secondary plastid-bearing algae, miniaturized versions of the endosymbiont nuclei (nucleomorphs) persist in cryptophytes and chlorarachniophytes. To determine why, and to address other fundamental questions about eukaryote-eukaryote endosymbiosis, we sequenced the nuclear genomes of the cryptophyte Guillardia theta and the chlorarachniophyte Bigelowiella natans. Both genomes have >21,000 protein genes and are intron rich, and B. natans exhibits unprecedented alternative splicing for a single-celled organism. Phylogenomic analyses and subcellular targeting predictions reveal extensive genetic and biochemical mosaicism, with both host- and endosymbiont-derived genes servicing the mitochondrion, the host cell cytosol, the plastid and the remnant endosymbiont cytosol of both algae. Mitochondrion-to-nucleus gene transfer still occurs in both organisms but plastid-to-nucleus and nucleomorph-to-nucleus transfers do not, which explains why a small residue of essential genes remains locked in each nucleomorph."
https://openalex.org/W2069777680,"Rachel Freathy and colleagues report results of a large-scale genome-wide association study of birth weight. They identify four loci newly associated with this trait and find overlap between birth weight–associated loci and those influencing adult height and metabolism. Birth weight within the normal range is associated with a variety of adult-onset diseases, but the mechanisms behind these associations are poorly understood1. Previous genome-wide association studies of birth weight identified a variant in the ADCY5 gene associated both with birth weight and type 2 diabetes and a second variant, near CCNL1, with no obvious link to adult traits2. In an expanded genome-wide association meta-analysis and follow-up study of birth weight (of up to 69,308 individuals of European descent from 43 studies), we have now extended the number of loci associated at genome-wide significance to 7, accounting for a similar proportion of variance as maternal smoking. Five of the loci are known to be associated with other phenotypes: ADCY5 and CDKAL1 with type 2 diabetes, ADRB1 with adult blood pressure and HMGA2 and LCORL with adult height. Our findings highlight genetic links between fetal growth and postnatal growth and metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1994751787,"Single-molecule FRET assays used to probe the conformational dynamics of ubiquitin chains reveal that conformational selection is an important mechanism of ubiquitin chain recognition. Post-translational modification of protein by ubiquitin regulates many biological processes. Ubiquitin is conjugated to its substrates either as a monomer or as polymeric chains. These chains come in various forms with distinct linkage types, for instance through the Lys 48, Lys 63 or Met 1 residues, depending on the cell function involved. In this study, Komander and colleagues use single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays to probe the conformational dynamics of ubiquitin chains. The results suggest that conformational selection is an important mechanism of chain recognition by ubiquitin-binding domains and deubiquitinases, suggesting that factors influencing ubiquitin chain conformation and dynamics may be regulators of the ubiquitin system. Mechanisms of protein recognition have been extensively studied for single-domain proteins1, but are less well characterized for dynamic multidomain systems. Ubiquitin chains represent a biologically important multidomain system that requires recognition by structurally diverse ubiquitin-interacting proteins2,3. Ubiquitin chain conformations in isolation are often different from conformations observed in ubiquitin-interacting protein complexes, indicating either great dynamic flexibility or extensive chain remodelling upon binding. Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we show that Lys 63-, Lys 48- and Met 1-linked diubiquitin exist in several distinct conformational states in solution. Lys 63- and Met 1-linked diubiquitin adopt extended ‘open’ and more compact ‘closed’ conformations, and ubiquitin-binding domains and deubiquitinases (DUBs) select pre-existing conformations. By contrast, Lys 48-linked diubiquitin adopts predominantly compact conformations. DUBs directly recognize existing conformations, but may also remodel ubiquitin chains to hydrolyse the isopeptide bond. Disruption of the Lys 48–diubiquitin interface changes conformational dynamics and affects DUB activity. Hence, conformational equilibria in ubiquitin chains provide an additional layer of regulation in the ubiquitin system, and distinct conformations observed in differently linked polyubiquitin may contribute to the specificity of ubiquitin-interacting proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2061775535,"The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway is one of two general protein transport systems found in the prokaryotic cytoplasmic membrane and is conserved in the thylakoid membrane of plant chloroplasts. The defining, and highly unusual, property of the Tat pathway is that it transports folded proteins, a task that must be achieved without allowing appreciable ion leakage across the membrane. The integral membrane TatC protein is the central component of the Tat pathway. TatC captures substrate proteins by binding their signal peptides. TatC then recruits TatA family proteins to form the active translocation complex. Here we report the crystal structure of TatC from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus. This structure provides a molecular description of the core of the Tat translocation system and a framework for understanding the unique Tat transport mechanism."

New research uses whole-organism screening to identify key regulators of fasting metabolism in zebrafish, including ligands for the mitochondrial transporter protein TSPO. Improving the control of energy homeostasis can lower cardiovascular risk in metabolically compromised individuals. To identify new regulators of whole-body energy control, we conducted a high-throughput screen in transgenic reporter zebrafish for small molecules that modulate the expression of the fasting-inducible gluconeogenic gene pck1. We show that this in vivo strategy identified several drugs that affect gluconeogenesis in humans as well as metabolically uncharacterized compounds. Most notably, we find that the translocator protein ligands PK 11195 and Ro5-4864 are glucose-lowering agents despite a strong inductive effect on pck1 expression. We show that these drugs are activators of a fasting-like energy state and, notably, that they protect high-fat diet–induced obese mice from hepatosteatosis and glucose intolerance, two pathological manifestations of metabolic dysregulation. Thus, using a whole-organism screening strategy, this study has identified new small-molecule activators of fasting metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2064770755,"Mutations in phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) or genomic alterations in the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase-signalling pathway are the most common genetic alterations reported in human prostate cancer. However, the precise mechanism underlying how indolent tumours with PTEN alterations acquire metastatic potential remains poorly understood. Recent studies suggest that upregulation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signalling triggered by PTEN loss will form a growth barrier as a defence mechanism to constrain prostate cancer progression, underscoring that TGF-β signalling might represent a pre-invasive checkpoint to prevent PTEN-mediated prostate tumorigenesis. Here we show that COUP transcription factor II (COUP-TFII, also known as NR2F2), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, serves as a key regulator to inhibit SMAD4-dependent transcription, and consequently overrides the TGF-β-dependent checkpoint for PTEN-null indolent tumours. Overexpression of COUP-TFII in the mouse prostate epithelium cooperates with PTEN deletion to augment malignant progression and produce an aggressive metastasis-prone tumour. The functional counteraction between COUP-TFII and SMAD4 is reinforced by genetically engineered mouse models in which conditional loss of SMAD4 diminishes the inhibitory effects elicited by COUP-TFII ablation. The biological significance of COUP-TFII in prostate carcinogenesis is substantiated by patient sample analysis, in which COUP-TFII expression or activity is tightly correlated with tumour recurrence and disease progression, whereas it is inversely associated with TGF-β signalling. These findings reveal that the destruction of the TGF-β-dependent barrier by COUP-TFII is crucial for the progression of PTEN-mutant prostate cancer into a life-threatening disease, and supports COUP-TFII as a potential drug target for the intervention of metastatic human prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2045728532,"Measurements of surface reflectance of permanently shadowed areas near Mercury's north pole reveal regions of anomalously dark and bright deposits at 1064-nanometer wavelength. These reflectance anomalies are concentrated on poleward-facing slopes and are spatially collocated with areas of high radar backscatter postulated to be the result of near-surface water ice. Correlation of observed reflectance with modeled temperatures indicates that the optically bright regions are consistent with surface water ice, whereas dark regions are consistent with a surface layer of complex organic material that likely overlies buried ice and provides thermal insulation. Impacts of comets or volatile-rich asteroids could have provided both dark and bright deposits."

https://openalex.org/W2015716486,"Cyclotides are disulfide-rich macrocyclic peptides that display a wide range of bioactivities and represent an important group of plant defense peptide biologics. A few linear variants of cyclotides have recently been identified. They share a high sequence homology with cyclotides but are biosynthetically unable to cyclize from their precursors. All hitherto reported cyclotides and their acyclic variants were isolated from dicot plants of the Rubiaceae, Violaceae, Cucurbitaceae, and recently the Fabaceae and Solanaceae families. Although several cyclotide-like genes in the Poaceae family were known from the data mining of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nucleotide database, their expression at the protein level has yet to be proven. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of nine novel linear cyclotides, designated as panitides L1-9, from the Panicum laxum of the Poaceae family and provide the first evidence of linear cyclotides at the protein level in a monocot plant. Disulfide mapping of panitide L3 showed that it possesses a cystine knot arrangement similar to cyclotides. Several panitides were shown to be active against Escherichia coli and cytotoxic to HeLa cells. They also displayed a high stability against heat and proteolytic degradation. Oxidative folding of the disulfide-reduced panitide L1 showed that it can fold efficiently into its native form. The presence of linear cyclotides in both dicots and monocots suggests their ancient origin and existence before the divergence of these two groups of flowering plants. Moreover, the Poaceae family contains many important food crops, and our discovery may open up new avenues of research using cyclotides and their acyclic variants in crop protection."

Over millions of years, flowing river water carved out the canyon that today measures over 1.6 km deep and 29 km long. Most models posit that the majority of the canyon formed 5 to 6 million years ago. Using thermochronometry, Flowers and Farley (p. 1616 , published online 29 November) examined the temperature-dependent diffusion of helium within mineral grains representative of the canyon basement, which cools as erosion brings crustal rocks near the surface. After validating the approach across the younger eastern canyon, the model suggests that the western canyon experienced an ancient cooling event induced by erosional processes, such that the canyon likely reached near modern depths by 70 million years ago—nearly 60 million years earlier than generally believed."
https://openalex.org/W2054340362,"AKT is a critical effector kinase downstream of the PI3K pathway that regulates a plethora of cellular processes including cell growth, death, differentiation, and migration. Mechanisms underlying activated phospho-AKT (pAKT) translocation to its action sites remain unclear. Here we show that NEDD4-1 is a novel E3 ligase that specifically regulates ubiquitin-dependent trafficking of pAKT in insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 signaling. NEDD4-1 physically interacts with AKT and promotes HECT domain-dependent ubiquitination of exogenous and endogenous AKT. NEDD4-1 catalyzes K63-type polyubiquitin chain formation on AKT in vitro. Plasma membrane binding is the key step for AKT ubiquitination by NEDD4-1 in vivo. Ubiquitinated pAKT translocates to perinuclear regions, where it is released into the cytoplasm, imported into the nucleus, or coupled with proteasomal degradation. IGF-1 signaling specifically stimulates NEDD4-1-mediated ubiquitination of pAKT, without altering total AKT ubiquitination. A cancer-derived plasma membrane-philic mutant AKT(E17K) is more effectively ubiquitinated by NEDD4-1 and more efficiently trafficked into the nucleus compared with wild type AKT. This study reveals a novel mechanism by which a specific E3 ligase is required for ubiquitin-dependent control of pAKT dynamics in a ligand-specific manner."

The Notch receptor binds its ligands Delta and Serrate and is able to discriminate between them in different contexts. However, the specific domains in Notch responsible for this selectivity are poorly defined. Through genetic screens in Drosophila, we isolated a mutation, Notch(jigsaw), that affects Serrate- but not Delta-dependent signaling. Notch(jigsaw) carries a missense mutation in epidermal growth factor repeat-8 (EGFr-8) and is defective in Serrate binding. A homologous point mutation in mammalian Notch2 also exhibits defects in signaling of a mammalian Serrate homolog, Jagged1. Hence, an evolutionarily conserved valine in EGFr-8 is essential for ligand selectivity and provides a molecular handle to study numerous Notch-dependent signaling events."

Here we use single-molecule and ensemble assays to show that large T antigen assembled on the SV40 origin unwinds DNA efficiently as a single hexamer that translocates on single-stranded DNA in the 3'-to-5' direction. Unexpectedly, large T antigen unwinds DNA past a DNA-protein crosslink on the translocation strand, suggesting that the large T antigen ring can open to bypass bulky adducts. Together, our data underscore the profound conservation among replicative helicase mechanisms, and reveal a new level of plasticity in the interactions of replicative helicases with DNA damage."

Iron is typically bioavailable only when present in a dissolved state; however, a large fraction of the total iron in the oceans exists as tiny solid-phase particles ranging in size from a few nanometers to a few micrometers. von der Heyden et al. (p. 1199 ) used high-resolution x-ray microscopy and spectroscopy to characterize the distribution of iron particles along two transects of the Southern Ocean. Analysis of a number of individual particles reveals strong variation in iron oxidation state, particle mineralogy, and substitution of aluminum for iron—all of which control the solubility, and hence bioavailability, of iron."
https://openalex.org/W2085470111,"Glioblastomas are very difficult tumors to treat because they are highly invasive and disseminate within the normal brain, resulting in newly growing tumors. We have identified netrin-1 as a molecule that promotes glioblastoma invasiveness. As evidence, netrin-1 stimulates glioblastoma cell invasion directly through Matrigel-coated transwells, promotes tumor cell sprouting and enhances metastasis to lymph nodes in vivo. Furthermore, netrin-1 regulates angiogenesis as shown in specific angiogenesis assays such as enhanced capillary endothelial cells (EC) sprouting and by increased EC infiltration into Matrigel plugs in vivo, as does VEGF-A. This netrin-1 signaling pathway in glioblastoma cells includes activation of RhoA and cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB). A novel finding is that netrin-1-induced glioblastoma invasiveness and angiogenesis are mediated by activated cathepsin B (CatB), a cysteine protease that translocates to the cell surface as an active enzyme and co-localizes with cell surface annexin A2 (ANXA2). The specific CatB inhibitor CA-074Me inhibits netrin-1-induced cell invasion, sprouting, and Matrigel plug angiogenesis. Silencing of CREB suppresses netrin-1-induced glioblastoma cell invasion, sprouting, and CatB expression. It is concluded that netrin-1 plays an important dual role in glioblastoma progression by promoting both glioblastoma cell invasiveness and angiogenesis in a RhoA-, CREB-, and CatB-dependent manner. Targeting netrin-1 pathways may be a promising strategy for brain cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2057220683,"DNA Repair in Vitro Accurate replication of the genome is critical to an organism's continued survival. Damaged DNA not repaired before the commencement of replication can cause the DNA replication fork to stall or collapse, which can result in mutation or recombination, with potentially serious consequences for cell and organism. Fork regression involving a so-called “chicken foot” structure (Holliday junction) is thought to provide one mechanism for dealing with unrepaired DNA damage during replication. Manosas et al. (p. 1217 ) analyzed the action of the T4 bacteriophage replisome and helicase UvsW on a stalled-fork mimic in vitro, using a magnetic trap. UvsW was able to switch migration directions, which was essential for remodeling the stalled fork. Together, UvsW and T4 holoenzyme were able to drive template switching and lesion bypass in vitro."

Using three-dimensional (3D) computer graphics and computational biology to study scale generation, Milinkovitch et al. (p. 78 , published online 29 November; see the cover) show that crocodilians' face and jaw scales do not follow this rule but emerge by physical cracking of the developing skin in a tension field. Thus, a crocodile's head scales are not genetically controlled developmental units but are random polygonal domains of keratinized skin that are generated from a self-organizing physical process."
https://openalex.org/W2055011794,"The mechanisms by which functional left/right asymmetry arises in morphologically symmetric nervous systems are poorly understood. Here, we provide a mechanistic framework for how functional asymmetry in a postmitotic neuron pair is specified in C. elegans. A key feature of this mechanism is a temporally separated, two-step activation of the lsy-6 miRNA locus. The lsy-6 locus is first “primed” by chromatin decompaction in the precursor for the left neuron, but not the right neuron, several divisions before the neurons are born. lsy-6 expression is then “boosted” to functionally relevant levels several divisions later in the mother of the left neuron, through the activity of a bilaterally expressed transcription factor that can only activate lsy-6 in the primed neuron. This study shows how cells can become committed during early developmental stages to execute a specific fate much later in development and provides a conceptual framework for understanding the generation of neuronal diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2067303080,"In eukaryotes, the differentiation of cellular extensions such as cilia or neuronal axons depends on the partitioning of proteins to distinct plasma membrane domains by specialized diffusion barriers. However, examples of this compartmentalization strategy are still missing for prokaryotes, although complex cellular architectures are also widespread among this group of organisms. This study reveals the existence of a protein-mediated membrane diffusion barrier in the stalked bacterium Caulobacter crescentus. We show that the Caulobacter cell envelope is compartmentalized by macromolecular complexes that prevent the exchange of both membrane and soluble proteins between the polar stalk extension and the cell body. The barrier structures span the cross-sectional area of the stalk and comprise at least four proteins that assemble in a cell-cycle-dependent manner. Their presence is critical for cellular fitness because they minimize the effective cell volume, allowing faster adaptation to environmental changes that require de novo synthesis of envelope proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2013430573,"Allosteric conformations and proteolytic activities of each subunit of the trimeric E. coli DegS protease share a cooperatively coupled energy landscape that allows regulation via the binding of substrate and OMP peptides. The PDZ domains of the trimeric DegS protease bind unassembled outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) that accumulate in the Escherichia coli periplasm. This cooperative binding reaction triggers a proteolytic cascade that activates a transcriptional stress response. To dissect the mechanism of allosteric activation, we generated hybrid DegS trimers with different numbers of PDZ domains and/or protease-domain mutations. By studying the chemical reactivity and enzymatic properties of these hybrids, we show that all subunits experience a strongly coupled energetic landscape. For example, OMP peptide binding to a single PDZ domain stimulates active site chemical modification and proteolytic cleavage in the attached and neighboring protease domains. OMP peptide binding relieves inhibitory PDZ interactions, whereas the interfaces between protease domains in the trimeric DegS core mediate positively cooperative activation driven by both substrate binding and inhibition relief."

https://openalex.org/W1974991907,"Secretion of anti-serpin B13 autoantibodies in young diabetes-prone nonobese diabetic mice is associated with reduced inflammation in pancreatic islets and a slower progression to autoimmune diabetes. Injection of these mice with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against serpin B13 also leads to fewer inflammatory cells in the islets and more rapid recovery from recent-onset diabetes. The exact mechanism by which anti-serpin activity is protective remains unclear. We found that serpin B13 is expressed in the exocrine component of the mouse pancreas, including the ductal cells. We also found that anti-serpin B13 mAb blocked the inhibitory activity of serpin B13, thereby allowing partial preservation of the function of its target protease. Consistent with the hypothesis that anti-clade B serpin activity blocks the serpin from binding, exposure to exogenous anti-serpin B13 mAb or endogenous anti-serpin B13 autoantibodies resulted in cleavage of the surface molecules CD4 and CD19 in lymphocytes that accumulated in the pancreatic islets and pancreatic lymph nodes but not in the inguinal lymph nodes. This cleavage was inhibited by an E64 protease inhibitor. Consequently, T cells with the truncated form of CD4 secreted reduced levels of interferon-γ. We conclude that anti-serpin antibodies prevent serpin B13 from neutralizing proteases, thereby impairing leukocyte function and reducing the severity of autoimmune inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2088841927,"Histone transcription and deposition are tightly regulated with the DNA replication cycle to maintain genetic integrity. Ams2 is a GATA-containing transcription factor responsible for core histone gene expression and for CENP-A loading at centromeres in fission yeast. Ams2 levels are cell cycle-regulated, and after the S phase Ams2 is degraded by the SCF(pof3) ubiquitin ligase; however, the regulation of Ams2 in G(1) or meiosis is poorly understood. Here we show that another ubiquitin ligase, the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) targets Ams2 for destruction in G(1). Ubiquitylation and destruction of Ams2 is dependent upon a coactivator Cdh1/Ste9 and the KEN box in the C terminus of Ams2. We also find that stabilization of Ams2 sensitizes cells to the anti-microtubule drug thiabendazole and the histone deacetylase inhibitor tricostatin A when a histone deacetylase gene hst4 is deleted, suggesting that histone acetylation together with Ams2 stability ensures the coupling of mitosis to DNA replication. Furthermore, in meiosis, the failure of the APC/C-mediated destruction of Ams2 is deleterious, and pre-meiotic DNA replication is barely completed. These data suggest that Ams2 destruction via both the APC/C and the SCF ubiquitin ligases underlies the coordination of histone expression and DNA replication."

https://openalex.org/W2077831872,"Since the discovery of mitotic spindle microtubules, there have been two competing ideas about the origins of forces for chromosome segregation during cell division: the dynamics of microtubules, and the action of motor enzymes. When I entered this research field in the late 1960s, the sliding filament theory of muscle contraction was already well established, and contemporary structural and biochemical work on cilia made a motor-based mechanism for mitosis seem likely. Moreover, my colleagues and I discovered a remarkably simple model for mitosis based on the postulate of a single, microtubule-sliding motor and some — then plausible — assumptions about spindle microtubule polarity. So in spite of the beautiful work by Shinya Inoue and his students showing the importance of microtubule depolymerization for permitting chromosome motions, I was committed to the idea that motors were the drivers. Microtubule dynamics might be a mitotic regulator, but they seemed unlikely to provide the motive force.

Evidence for this position mounted during the 1970s and 1980s. Electron microscopy demonstrated rearrangements of spindle microtubules consistent with the idea that spindle elongation was driven by microtubule sliding. Experiments on spindle ‘models’, made by lysing cells in buffers that maintained spindle structure, showed that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was required for interpolar microtubule sliding, as happens during spindle elongation. The discovery of the kinesin motor and the determination of its sequence led to the realization that several mitotic mutants in fungi carried genes encoding defective kinesin-like proteins. The localization of dynein to kinetochores, where this pole-directed, microtubule-dependent motor could help move chromosomes to the spindle poles, enhanced the case. Although an assay our lab developed for microtubule polarity demonstrated that the simple model for mitosis was wrong, some spindle motions really did seem to depend on motors. Why not all of them?

In 1988, however, Marc Kirschner’s group published a provocative paper in Nature entitled ‘Polewards chromosome movement driven by microtubule depolymerization in vitro’, which showed how controversial the issue remained. Discussions in our lab led me to believe that it was imperative to develop an assay to look directly at the ability of microtubule depolymerization to exert forces on chromosomes. Martine Coue and Vivian Lombillo, a postdoctoral researcher and graduate student in our lab, took this project on. Using chromosomes isolated from chinese hamster ovary cells and tubulin purified from bovine brain, they constructed chambers for light microscopy in which the pole-facing ends of many labile microtubules were tethered firmly to small regions on the coverslip, and chromosomes were attached at or near the free microtubule plus ends. With this set-up, and in collaboration with Curt Pfarr and Corey Nislow, Martine and Vivian explored the conditions necessary to make chromosomes move. I had expected that motion would require Mg–ATP, and that we might even be able to identify the motor that did the job. I was amazed to learn that ATP was not required, and that function-blocking antibodies to dynein had no effect on the rates of movement seen. All that was needed was tubulin depolymerization from the chromosome-associated microtubule ends. The only plausible source of motive force in this assay was tubulin depolymerization itself, so we had to conclude that microtubule dynamics could indeed generate chromosome motion.

These results changed my approach to mitotic mechanisms. They did not negate the evidence that motors were important for aspects of mitosis, but they suggested that chromosome motion to the spindle poles could be motor-independent. So how did the mechanism work? These initial experiments defined several lines of work that have occupied our group ever since. Are microtubule-dependent motors dispensable for chromosome-to-pole motion in vivo? What molecules serve as tethers to couple the ‘payload’ to tubulin depolymerization? How much force can a depolymerizing microtubule generate? How is depolymerization regulated, so chromosomes move at their normal, stately pace?

Katya Grishchuk in the lab made a strain of fission yeast in which all the genes for pole-directed motor enzymes were deleted, yet the chromosomes continued to move polewards with a final speed no different from in wild-type cells, a result that has been extended to budding yeast by Tomo Tanaka’s group (University of Dundee, Scotland). Many labs have now identified kinetochore proteins that are essential for the formation of successful linkages between chromosomes and spindle microtubules, and our group has explored the biophysical properties of several of these, testing their ability to couple chromosomes to shortening microtubules. Some motor enzymes will do the job, even if they have to be pushed backwards by the depolymerization reaction. Some non-motor molecules will also work: protein complexes that will assemble into rings, proteins that bind to microtubule walls, and even some that bind the flaring strands of tubulin at a microtubule’s depolymerizing end. Moreover, depolymerization can generate plenty of force. We can now envision mechanical parallels between mitosis in eukaryotes and chromosome segregation in bacteria, where fibre-dependent motors do not exist but fibre dynamics seem important. The Kirschner paper and our initial system for depolymerization-dependent motility were turning points that led our lab in exciting directions that I would never have anticipated during the days of my fascination with motors."
