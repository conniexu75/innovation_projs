True prions stably maintain unique conformations (“strains”) in vivo that link structure to patterns of pathology. We now find that tau meets this criterion. Stably expressed tau repeat domain indefinitely propagates distinct amyloid conformations in a clonal fashion in culture. Reintroduction of tau from these lines into naive cells reestablishes identical clones. We produced two strains in vitro that induce distinct pathologies in vivo as determined by successive inoculations into three generations of transgenic mice. Immunopurified tau from these mice recreates the original strains in culture. We used the cell system to isolate tau strains from 29 patients with 5 different tauopathies, finding that different diseases are associated with different sets of strains. Tau thus demonstrates essential characteristics of a prion. This might explain the phenotypic diversity of tauopathies and could enable more effective diagnosis and therapy.

Tauopathies are a diverse group of neurodegenerative diseases defined by accumulation of fibrillar deposits of the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) (Lee et al., 2001Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Neurodegenerative tauopathies.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar). Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common tauopathy, affects >30 million people worldwide and will afflict >120 million by 2050 (Holtzman et al., 2011Holtzman D.M. Morris J.C. Goate A.M. Alzheimer’s disease: the challenge of the second century.Sci Transl Med. 2011; 3: 77sr1Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). MAPT mutations cause dominantly inherited tauopathies (Hutton et al., 1998Hutton M. Lendon C.L. Rizzu P. Baker M. Froelich S. Houlden H. Pickering-Brown S. Chakraverty S. Isaacs A. Grover A. et al.Association of missense and 5′-splice-site mutations in tau with the inherited dementia FTDP-17.Nature. 1998; 393: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (2913) Google Scholar) and most increase the propensity of tau to form amyloids (Barghorn et al., 2000Barghorn S. Zheng-Fischhöfer Q. Ackmann M. Biernat J. von Bergen M. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Structure, microtubule interactions, and paired helical filament aggregation by tau mutants of frontotemporal dementias.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11714-11721Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), which are paracrystalline protein assemblies rich in beta-sheet structure (Bonar et al., 1969Bonar L. Cohen A.S. Skinner M.M. Characterization of the amyloid fibril as a cross-beta protein.Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1969; 131: 1373-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Most tauopathy cases are sporadic, with variable clinical and pathological presentation (Lee et al., 2001Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Neurodegenerative tauopathies.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar). The prion hypothesis posits that pathological aggregates of the mammalian prion protein (PrP) cause infectious, sporadic, and familial neurodegenerative diseases (Prusiner, 1998Prusiner S.B. Prions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5147) Google Scholar). In contrast, yeast prions are adaptive and confer phenotypic diversity and rapid evolution of new traits in times of stress (True and Lindquist, 2000True H.L. Lindquist S.L. A yeast prion provides a mechanism for genetic variation and phenotypic diversity.Nature. 2000; 407: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Both yeast and mammalian prions form strains, which are encoded by distinct fibrillar structures (Safar et al., 1998Safar J. Wille H. Itri V. Groth D. Serban H. Torchia M. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Eight prion strains have PrP(Sc) molecules with different conformations.Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1157-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar, Toyama et al., 2007Toyama B.H. Kelly M.J.S. Gross J.D. Weissman J.S. The structural basis of yeast prion strain variants.Nature. 2007; 449: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Prion strains determine the incubation periods of disease in humans (Kim et al., 2012Kim C. Haldiman T. Surewicz K. Cohen Y. Chen W. Blevins J. Sy M.-S. Cohen M. Kong Q. Telling G.C. et al.Small protease sensitive oligomers of PrPSc in distinct human prions determine conversion rate of PrP(C).PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8: e1002835Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and mice (Legname et al., 2006Legname G. Nguyen H.-O.B. Peretz D. Cohen F.E. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Continuum of prion protein structures enciphers a multitude of prion isolate-specified phenotypes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 19105-19110Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In addition, human prion strains are thought to underlie clinical symptoms and pathological presentation (Collinge and Clarke, 2007Collinge J. Clarke A.R. A general model of prion strains and their pathogenicity.Science. 2007; 318: 930-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that common neurodegenerative diseases such as AD could be caused by a prion-like mechanism was suggested three decades ago (Prusiner, 1984Prusiner S.B. Some speculations about prions, amyloid, and Alzheimer’s disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 310: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Recently, however, experimental work on diverse amyloids has generated new interest (Frost and Diamond, 2010Frost B. Diamond M.I. Prion-like mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases.Nat. Rev.

Prior studies suggest that tau aggregates spread among cells via templated conformational change (Frost et al., 2009aFrost B. Jacks R.L. Diamond M.I.

Jaton A.L. et al.Exogenous induction of cerebral beta-amyloidogenesis is governed by agent and host.Science. 2006; 313: 1781-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Bona fide prions are defined by propagation of distinct conformational strains in vivo, and prior studies have hinted at prion-like strain properties of non-PrP human amyloids. For example, amyloid β protein forms at least two distinct, self-propagating fibrillar conformations in vitro (Petkova et al., 2005Petkova A.T. Leapman R.D. Guo Z. Yau W.-M. Mattson M.P. Tycko R. Self-propagating, molecular-level polymorphism in Alzheimer's beta-amyloid fibrils.Science. 2005; 307: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar) and in vivo (Lu et al., 2013Lu J.-X.

Others have demonstrated propagation in vitro of distinct tau (Frost et al., 2009bFrost B. Ollesch J. Wille H. Diamond M.I.

Neurodegener. 2013; 8: 17Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). While provocative, these prior studies have not demonstrated that noninfectious proteopathic seeds act as true prions. Specifically, it has not been shown that distinct conformations or “strains” are capable of transmission into a living cell or organism, propagation through multiple generations, extraction, and reintroduction to naive cells or organisms to replicate the same structural phenotype (Collinge and Clarke, 2007Collinge J. Clarke A.R. A general model of prion strains and their pathogenicity.Science. 2007; 318: 930-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). This is important not for semantic reasons, but because if prion mechanisms underlie human disease, only stably propagating strains can account for stereotyped clinical presentation and network spread. In this study, we have found that tau acts as a prion by these criteria, and, further, that individual human tauopathies are associated with unique strains. Amino acid sequence disparities impair cross-seeding between PrP moieties from different species, leading to “seeding barriers” (Collinge and Clarke, 2007Collinge J. Clarke A.R. A general model of prion strains and their pathogenicity.Science. 2007; 318: 930-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). To test the fidelity of hetero- versus homotypic seeding for tau, we expressed several amyloidogenic proteins and exposed them to a variety of fibrillar seeds. Prolonged expression of full-length (FL) tau can be toxic to dividing cells. Thus for tau, we expressed the aggregation-competent core, termed the repeat domain (tau RD; aa 244–372 of the 441 aa FL tau 4R2N) (Wischik et al., 1988Wischik C.M. Novak M. Thøgersen H.C. Edwards P.C. Runswick M.J. Jakes R. Walker J.E. Milstein C. Roth M. Klug A. Isolation of a fragment of tau derived from the core of the paired helical filament of Alzheimer disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1988; 85: 4506-4510Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). We generated polyclonal HEK293 cell lines stably expressing tau RD-YFP, α-synuclein-YFP, or huntingtin (htt) exon 1(Q25)-YFP (see Figure S1A for construct diagrams). Inclusions did not occur in any line without exposure to exogenous fibrils. However, upon transduction of fibrils (Aβ [1–42], htt exon 1 N17[Q35], α-synuclein, tau RD) with liposomes, we observed homotypic but not heterotypic seeding for each amyloidogenic protein (Figure 1A; Figure S1B for quantification), consistent with sequence-specific templating. Prior reports have indicated that in certain cases, α-synuclein aggregates can cross-seed FL tau (Giasson et al., 2003Giasson B.I. Forman M.S. Higuchi M. Golbe L.I. Graves C.L. Kotzbauer P.T. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Initiation and synergistic fibrillization of tau and alpha-synuclein.Science. 2003; 300: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, Guo et al., 2013Guo J.L.

Neurosci. 2011; 31: 7604-7618Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested this for both YFP-tagged and untagged versions of FL tau 4R1N P301S. We observed only homotypic seeding and no cross-seeding of tau by α-synuclein or any other amyloid (Figures S1C and S1D). This is consistent with sequence-specific templating, although we cannot rule out the possibility that different amyloid conformers are capable of heterologous seeding, as has previously been reported (Guo et al., 2013Guo J.L. Covell D.J. Daniels J.P. Iba M. Stieber A. Zhang B. Riddle D.M. Kwong L.K. Xu Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Distinct α-synuclein strains differentially promote tau inclusions in neurons.Cell. 2013; 154: 103-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Amyloids typically feature a cross beta-sheet conformation (Bonar et al., 1969Bonar L. Cohen A.S. Skinner M.M. Characterization of the amyloid fibril as a cross-beta protein.Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1969; 131: 1373-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We exploited two proline substitutions (I277P/I308P) in tau that block its ability to enter into this quaternary form (von Bergen et al., 2001von Bergen M. Barghorn S. Li L. Marx A. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Mutations of tau protein in frontotemporal dementia promote aggregation of paired helical filaments by enhancing local beta-structure.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48165-48174Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) to test whether inclusion formation requires this property. Polyclonal HEK293 cell lines stably expressing tau RD-YFP with no mutations (wild-type, WT), P301L/V337M (LM: proaggregation), ΔK280 (proaggregation), or ΔK280/I277P/I308P (2P: antiaggregation) were transduced with tau RD fibrils. All formed inclusions except tau RD(2P)-YFP, confirming that beta-sheet structure is required for tau RD inclusion formation in our model system (Figure 1B).

Structural and functional characterization of two alpha-synuclein strains.Nat Commun. 2013; 4: 2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) form persistent intracellular inclusions in cultured cells. We tested this for tau RD. We transduced tau RD fibrils or buffer into polyclonal tau RD(LM)-YFP (hereafter, referred to as tau RD) cells, chosen for their superior ability to be seeded relative to tau RD(WT)-YFP, and quantified the percentage of cells with inclusions on every other passage. Transduced fibrils induced tau RD inclusions that persisted >50 days postexposure (Figure 1C). We hypothesized that the aggregated state was stably inherited because inclusion-containing cells formed local clusters (Figure 1D). To test this, we sparsely diluted fibril-transduced tau RD cells to isolate individual colonies. These were composed of either 100% inclusion-negative (Figure 1E) or 100% inclusion-positive (Figure 1F) cells, indicating stable inheritance of the aggregated state. Only prion protein (PrP) (Birkett et al., 2001Birkett C.R. Hennion R.M. Bembridge D.A. Clarke M.C. Chree A. Bruce M.E. Bostock C.J. Scrapie strains maintain biological phenotypes on propagation in a cell line in culture.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3351-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and certain fungal prions (e.g., Sup35 [PSI+]) (Derkatch et al., 1996Derkatch I.L. Chernoff Y.O. Kushnirov V.V. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Liebman S.W. Genesis and variability of [PSI] prion factors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 1996; 144: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) unequivocally propagate distinct conformational states, or strains, in cell culture. To test the ability of tau RD to propagate distinct conformers, we diluted fibril-transduced monoclonal tau RD cells and isolated individual clones that stably propagated inclusions (Figure 2A). Previous work with the Sup35 protein has indicated that inclusion morphology is a proxy for biochemically distinct yeast prion strains in dividing mammalian cells (Krammer et al., 2009Krammer C. Kryndushkin D. Suhre M.H. Kremmer E. Hofmann A. Pfeifer A. Scheibel T. Wickner R.B. Schätzl H.M. Vorberg I. The yeast Sup35NM domain propagates as a prion in mammalian cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 462-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We thus characterized 20 tau RD clones based on inclusion morphology, numbered in order of isolation. Most (Figure S2A) featured small juxtanuclear inclusions with many nuclear speckles, exemplified by clone 9 (Figure 2B). Clone 10 alone propagated a single, large juxtanuclear inclusion (Figure 2B). We confirmed that stably propagated tau RD inclusions were amyloids as clones 9 and 10, but not inclusion-negative clone 1, bound X-34, a Congo red derivative that stains beta-sheet structures (Figure 2C). To characterize the clones biochemically, we first used semidenaturing detergent agarose gel electrophoresis (SDD-AGE), a method that differentiates strains based on aggregate size (Kryndushkin et al., 2003Kryndushkin D.S. Alexandrov I.M. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Kushnirov V.V. Yeast [PSI+] prion aggregates are formed by small Sup35 polymers fragmented by Hsp104.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49636-49643Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Tau RD species from clone 10 were larger than those propagated by clone 9 (Figure 2D). Thus, the clone 10 fibrils might not be as readily fragmented into smaller species (Tanaka et al., 2006Tanaka M. Collins S.R. Toyama B.H. Weissman J.S. The physical basis of how prion conformations determine strain phenotypes.Nature. 2006; 442: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Next, we used sedimentation analysis to differentiate the strains (Tanaka et al., 2006Tanaka M. Collins S.R. Toyama B.H. Weissman J.S. The physical basis of how prion conformations determine strain phenotypes.Nature. 2006; 442: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Clone 1 had entirely soluble tau RD, whereas clones 9 and 10 had insoluble tau RD (Figure 2E). Clone 10 featured more soluble tau RD than clone 9. To probe for structural differences, we used limited proteolysis as has been used previously for differentiating PrP conformers (Bessen and Marsh, 1994Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. Distinct PrP properties suggest the molecular basis of strain variation in transmissible mink encephalopathy.J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7859-7868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lines propagating aggregates (clones 9, 10) featured pronase-resistant species between 10 and 13 kDa, as well as between 20 and 25 kDa in size (Figure 2F). Clone 9 produced a smear between 10 and 13 kDa, whereas clone 10 produced a clear doublet. These studies indicated clear differences in biochemical characteristics of the clones, consistent with distinct strain conformations. Prion strains often have different seeding efficiencies, which can result in variable incubation times in vivo (Legname et al., 2006Legname G. Nguyen H.-O.B. Peretz D. Cohen F.E. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Continuum of prion protein structures enciphers a multitude of prion isolate-specified phenotypes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 19105-19110Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Thus we compared the clones, modifying a preexisting split-luciferase complementation assay (Naik and Piwnica-Worms, 2007Naik S. Piwnica-Worms D. Real-time imaging of beta-catenin dynamics in cells and living mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 17465-17470Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) for use as a tau aggregation sensor (Figure S1A). Clone 1 contained no seeding activity. However, inclusion-containing lines seeded robustly, especially clone 9, which seeded more than clone 10 (Figure 2G). Differences in seeding were not an artifact of cell confluency, as determined by normalizing to cell number in seeding experiments (Figure S2B). Next, we compared the toxicities of clones 9 and 10. Although clone 9 lysate initially seeded a greater number of cells, these were rapidly eliminated relative to those induced by clone 10 (Figure 2H). Furthermore, cells containing clone 9-derived inclusions grew more slowly than those derived from clone 10 (Figure 2I). Whereas growth rate of nontransfected HEK293 cells was not affected by inoculation with clone 9 lysate, growth of tau RD cells was impaired following the same treatment (Figure S2C). This was not seen for clone 10. Finally, an LDH assay suggested that clone 9 lysate is toxic to tau RD cells relative to a sham treatment (Figure S2D). A previous study reported that tau from human brain can induce aggresome structures in vitro (Santa-Maria et al., 2012Santa-Maria I. Varghese M. Ksiezak-Reding H. Dzhun A. Wang J. Pasinetti G.M. Paired helical filaments from Alzheimer disease brain induce intracellular accumulation of Tau protein in aggresomes.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 20522-20533Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the subcellular localization of inclusions associated with clones 9 and 10. Based on antivimentin stains (Figure S2E), electron microscopy (Figure S2F), and anti-γ-tubulin stains (Figure S2G), we conclude that juxtanuclear clone 10 inclusions are canonical aggresomes, unlike the inclusions of clone 9. Intranuclear clone 9 inclusions did not colocalize with PML bodies (Figure S2H). Thus, clones 9 and 10 propagate conformationally distinct tau prion strains, with different consequences for the cell. To test the fidelity of strain inheritance, we passaged them continuously for 6 months. Inclusion morphologies (Figure 2J) and limited proteolysis patterns (Figure 2K) associated with clones 9 and 10 were unaltered. Thus, tau RD prion strains are robust, maintaining their phenotypes indefinitely in cell culture. To rule out an effect of cell background on strain formation, we transduced clone 9 and 10 lysates into naive monoclonal tau RD cells, isolating 6 colonies (A–F) for each (Figure 3A). We evaluated derivative clones (9C was lost in passage) by inclusion morphology (Figure 3B), SDD-AGE (Figure 3C), sedimentation analyses (Figure 3D; Figure S3B), seeding activity (Figure 3E), and limited proteolysis (Figure 3F). In all cases, derivative clones matched their associated progenitors, indicating that tau RD prion strains are encoded by conformation, independent of cell background. Faithful templating into naive cells also occurred after passive addition of lysates to media (Figure S3A), thus indicating that bypassing physiological uptake is not necessary for templating. With a Tet Off line to control tau RD expression, we demonstrated that the aggregate-positive phenotype can be cured by stopping expression for 7 days and then restarting it (Figures S3C and S3D). To rule out an artifact of using artificial truncated tau RD and dividing cell model systems, we examined FL tau inclusion formation in primary cortical neurons. Neurons expressing FL tau P301S-YFP formed detergent-resistant inclusions following treatment with clone 9 or 10, but not clone 1 or PBS (Figure 3G). Clone 9 seeded very robustly relative to clone 10 (Figure S3E). Clone 9 lysate created inclusions throughout the soma and processes of neurons with untagged and YFP-tagged FL P301S tau, whereas clone 10 lysate primarily seeded inclusion bodies confined to the soma (Figure 3G; Figures S3F and S3G). Corroborating prior studies (Aoyagi et al., 2007Aoyagi H. Hasegawa M. Tamaoka A. Fibrillogenic nuclei composed of P301L mutant tau induce elongation of P301L tau but not wild-type tau.J. Biol.

In eukaryotic cells, chromatin structure and posttranslational modification of histone proteins play central roles in regulating gene expression. This is exemplified in animals where polycomb group proteins function as chromatin-based transcriptional repressors through their capacity to catalyze histone modifications and form higher order chromatin structures (recently reviewed in Schwartz and Pirrotta, 2013Schwartz Y.B.

Loss of polycomb protein function in Drosophila leads to abnormal body plan specification and in vertebrates polycomb orthologs are essential for normal embryonic development. Polycomb proteins are also perturbed in a range of cancers, suggesting that the polycomb system is critical for maintenance of normal cell identity (Bracken and Helin, 2009Bracken A.P. Helin K. Polycomb group proteins: navigators of lineage pathways led astray in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Polycomb proteins are generally found in one of two protein complexes, the polycomb repressive complexes 1 or 2 (PRC1 or PRC2). In mammals, the catalytic core of PRC2 is comprised of EZH1 or EZH2, which trimethylate histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3) (Cao et al., 2002Cao R. Wang L. Wang H. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H.

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms by which polycomb group proteins recognize their target sites and initiate repressive chromatin domains remain poorly defined.

Based on these initial observations, the prevailing view over the past decade has been that PRC1 is recruited in a hierarchical manner to sites with pre-existing PRC2 activity and H3K27me3. However, it has recently emerged that CBX proteins are in direct competition with two additional factors, RYBP/YAF2, for a mutually exclusive binding site on RING1A/B (Wang et al., 2010Wang R.

Significantly, H3K27me3-binding CBX proteins are limited to canonical PRC1 complexes containing either PCGF2 (MEL18) or PCGF4 (BMI1) and the Polyhomeotic proteins (PHC1/2/3) (Gao et al., 2012Gao Z.

The identification of variant PRC1 complexes and the observation that RING1B can occupy many of its target sites in the absence of H3K27me3 suggests that the hierarchical recruitment mechanism cannot explain all PRC1 complex targeting (Schoeftner et al., 2006Schoeftner S. Sengupta A.K. Kubicek S. Mechtler K. Spahn L. Koseki H. Jenuwein T. Wutz A.

Therefore, the central principles that underpin recognition of polycomb target sites in vivo and the molecular chain of events that leads to the formation of polycomb domains integrating both PRC1 and PRC2 activity remain unclear. In this study, we utilize a de novo targeting system and discover, contrary to expectation based on the proposed hierarchical recruitment mechanism, that binding of variant PRC1 complexes to chromatin is sufficient to initiate the formation of a polycomb domain containing PRC2 and H3K27me3. This activity is inherent to variant PRC1 complexes and relies on H2AK119ub1. Building on this striking observation, genetic ablation approaches in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) reveal that deletion of PRC1 has dramatic genome-wide effects on PRC2 occupancy and H3K27me3. We further demonstrate that recognition of nonmethylated DNA by KDM2B, part of the PCGF1/PRC1 variant complex, is important for deposition of H2AK119ub1 and recruitment of PRC2 to a subset of CpG island targets and that this targeting activity is essential for normal mouse development. Together, these observations reveal a new PRC1-dependent logic for polycomb domain formation. The hierarchical recruitment model posits that PRC2-dependent H3K27me3 is required to recruit canonical PRC1 complexes to chromatin. The recent demonstration that variant PRC1 complexes bind to many target sites, albeit at lower levels, independently of H3K27me3 suggests that PRC1 function may be more complex than previously envisaged (Tavares et al., 2012Tavares L. Dimitrova E. Oxley D. Webster J. Poot R. Demmers J. Bezstarosti K. Taylor S. Ura H. Koide H. et al.RYBP-PRC1 complexes mediate H2A ubiquitylation at polycomb target sites independently of PRC2 and H3K27me3.Cell. 2012; 148: 664-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). This new insight necessitates a more detailed examination of mammalian PRC1 complex function and targeting in vivo. Therefore, we sought to design a system in which individual PRC1 complexes could be targeted de novo to a chromatin environment free from the complexities and regulatory influences of natural polycomb target sites. To achieve this, a large bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing human DNA that lacks identifiable genes and shows no evidence for gene-, enhancer-, or polycomb-associated chromatin modifications was selected and bacterial Tet operator (TetO) DNA-binding sites were centrally inserted (Figure 1B). Importantly, the TetO lacks CpG dinucleotides and has no resemblance to natural polycomb targets which are CpG-rich (Ku et al., 2008Ku M. Koche R.P. Rheinbay E. Mendenhall E.M. Endoh M. Mikkelsen T.S. Presser A. Nusbaum C. Xie X. Chi A.S. et al.Genomewide analysis of PRC1 and PRC2 occupancy identifies two classes of bivalent domains.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000242Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). The TetO BAC was transposed into mouse ES cells at a site on chromosome 8, effectively flanking the TetO array with long stretches of inert chromatin (Figures 1B, S1A, and S1B). Fusion of PRC1 components to the bacterial Tet repressor (TetR) DNA-binding domain would permit de novo recruitment to the TetO array (Figure 1C) and the direct consequences of fusion protein occupancy could be examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). In mammals, PCGF proteins (PCGF1-6) are thought to define the composition of individual PRC1 complexes and regulate their assembly and function (Figure 1A). To dissect how individual PRC1 complexes function on chromatin, PCGF1-5 were fused to TetR and stably expressed in the TetO cell line (Figure 1C). ChIP experiments revealed that TetR-PCGF fusion proteins bound the TetO array and diminished to background levels in flanking regions (Figure 1D). All PCGF proteins resulted in recruitment of RING1B, but surprisingly, only PCGF1, 3, and 5, which exclusively form variant PRC1 complexes (Farcas et al., 2012Farcas A.M. Blackledge N.P. Sudbery I.

PRC1 and PRC2 largely occupy a common set of target sites in vivo (Ku et al., 2008Ku M. Koche R.P. Rheinbay E. Mendenhall E.M. Endoh M. Mikkelsen T.S. Presser A. Nusbaum C. Xie X.

Therefore, the possibility that PRC1 could potentially drive a reciprocal process and mediate PRC2 occupancy has not been specifically examined. By directly targeting individual PRC1 complexes to the TetO array, a unique opportunity existed to test whether PRC1 complexes can also drive PRC2 occupancy. Surprisingly, in the TetR-PCGF1, 3, and 5 fusion lines, ChIP analysis revealed binding of PRC2 components and H3K27me3 in regions flanking the TetO (Figure 1E). In contrast, TetR fusions with PCGF proteins that can form canonical PRC1 complexes (PCGF2 and 4) resulted in little, if any, PRC2 targeting and H3K27me3 (Figure 1E). Strikingly, variant complex-dependent PRC2 recruitment and H3K27me3 was also observed at a single naturally occurring TetO site in the mouse genome (Figures S1C and S1D), indicating that this is not unique to the engineered TetO array. Therefore, contrary to expectation based on the hierarchical recruitment mechanism, de novo recruitment of the PCGF 1, 3, and 5 variant PRC1 complexes results in the formation of a polycomb domain containing PRC2 and H3K27me3. Surprisingly, PCGF proteins that form canonical PRC1 complexes appeared less competent at H2AK119ub1 placement in tethering assays (Figure 1D). This lack of activity could be inherent to canonical PRC1 complexes or possibly result from their covalent fusion to TetR. To circumvent the necessity to fuse canonical complexes to TetR, PRC2 was recruited to the TetO via a TetR-EED fusion (Figure 2A) (Hansen et al., 2008Hansen K.H. Bracken A.P. Pasini D. Dietrich N. Gehani S.S. Monrad A. Rappsilber J. Lerdrup M. Helin K. A model for transmission of the H3K27me3 epigenetic mark.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1291-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). This led to deposition of H3K27me3 and recruitment of endogenous PCGF2 and CBX7, but not PCGF1, suggesting PRC2-dependent recruitment of canonical PRC1 complexes (Figure 2B). As was the case with direct tethering of PCGF2 or 4, native canonical PRC1 complex nucleation failed to deposit H2AK119ub1, suggesting the lack of activity in canonical PRC1 tethering experiments does not result from TetR fusion (Figure 2B). Interestingly, the binding profiles for canonical PRC1 components were not completely coincident with H3K27me3, as might be expected if occupancy was entirely CBX dependent. It remains unclear why this disparity in profiles existed, but it may result from secondary structural effects driven by exclusive canonical PRC1 complex recruitment (Isono et al., 2013Isono K. Endo T.A. Ku M. Yamada D. Suzuki R. Sharif J. Ishikura T. Toyoda T. Bernstein B.E. Koseki H. SAM domain polymerization links subnuclear clustering of PRC1 to gene silencing.Dev. Cell. 2013; 26: 565-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) or other undefined mechanisms involved in canonical PRC1 recruitment to regions containing PRC2 and H3K27me3. Interestingly, a similar discordance between CBX (PC) protein binding and H3K27me3 was observed at polycomb target sites in Drosophila cell culture models (Schwartz et al., 2006Schwartz Y.B. Kahn T.G. Nix D.A. Li X.Y. Bourgon R. Biggin M. Pirrotta V. Genome-wide analysis of Polycomb targets in Drosophila melanogaster.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 700-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this apparent failure of PRC2 and H3K27me3 to direct H2AK119ub1 parallels observations in mouse ESC lines devoid of H3K27me3 where levels of H2AK119ub1 at polycomb target sites are largely unaffected (Schoeftner et al., 2006Schoeftner S. Sengupta A.K. Kubicek S. Mechtler K. Spahn L. Koseki H. Jenuwein T. Wutz A. Recruitment of PRC1 function at the initiation of X inactivation independent of PRC2 and silencing.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3110-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, Tavares et al., 2012Tavares L. Dimitrova E. Oxley D. Webster J. Poot R. Demmers J. Bezstarosti K. Taylor S. Ura H.

Together, these observations strongly suggest that PRC2-mediated recruitment of canonical PRC1 complexes fails to catalyze significant levels of H2AK119ub1. The unexpected observation that variant PRC1 complexes can nucleate PRC2 to establish a polycomb domain de novo suggests that a feature associated with variant complex occupancy, perhaps H2AK119ub1, is responsible for this activity (Figure 1). To test this possibility, a single polypeptide fusion between the dimerization domains of RING1B and PCGF4 was engineered and fused to TetR (Bentley et al., 2011Bentley M.L. Corn J.E. Dong K.C. Phung Q. Cheung T.K. Cochran A.G.

This minimal RING1B/PCGF4 catalytic domain (RPCD) does not form normal PRC1 complexes (Figure 3A) but retains H2AK119ub1 E3 ligase activity (Figure 3B) (Cooper et al., 2014Cooper S. Dienstbier M.

When mutations were engineered in TetR-RPCD (TetR-RPCDmut), rendering it incapable of catalyzing H2AK119ub1, PRC2 and H3K27me3 were no longer recruited to the TetO (Figure 3B). This suggests that H2AK119ub1, and not simply binding of PRC1 complexes, is the central determinant driving PRC1-dependent recruitment of PRC2. To examine the possibility that H2AK119ub1 may play a general role in PRC2 localization and activity at normal polycomb target sites, we exploited a Ring1a−/−Ring1bfl/fl mouse ESC system, in which H2AK119ub1 can be rapidly depleted by removing the catalytic core of all PRC1 complexes (RING1A/B) through addition of the drug tamoxifen, without disrupting the cellular protein levels of PRC2 components (Endoh et al., 2008Endoh M.

Following RING1A/B deletion, ChIP-sequencing revealed a clear loss of SUZ12, EZH2, and H3K27me3 at individual genes (Figures 4D and S2A) and at target sites genome-wide (Figure 4E and 4F). Indeed, 85% of SUZ12 and 83% of EZH2 sites showed a greater than 1.5-fold reduction in occupancy after PRC1 removal (Figures 4G and S3A). A closer inspection of SUZ12 sites defined as having a less than 1.5-fold change in PRC2, revealed that these sites do exhibi"
https://openalex.org/W2008540208,"Recent studies have demonstrated that the anti-diabetic drug, metformin, can exhibit direct antitumoral effects, or can indirectly decrease tumor proliferation by improving insulin sensitivity. Despite these recent advances, the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in decreasing tumor formation are not well understood. In this study, we examined the antiproliferative role and mechanism of action of metformin in MCF-7 cancer cells treated with 10 mM of metformin for 24, 48, and 72 hours. Using BrdU and the MTT assay, it was found that metformin demonstrated an antiproliferative effect in MCF-7 cells that occurred in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Flow cytometry was used to analyze markers of cell cycle, apoptosis, necrosis and oxidative stress. Exposure to metformin induced cell cycle arrest in G0-G1 phase and increased cell apoptosis and necrosis, which were associated with increased oxidative stress. Gene and protein expression were determined in MCF-7 cells by real time RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. In MCF-7 cells metformin decreased the activation of IRβ, Akt and ERK1/2, increased p-AMPK, FOXO3a, p27, Bax and cleaved caspase-3, and decreased phosphorylation of p70S6K and Bcl-2 protein expression. Co-treatment with metformin and H2O2 increased oxidative stress which was associated with reduced cell number. In the presence of metformin, treating with SOD and catalase improved cell viability. Treatment with metformin resulted in an increase in p-p38 MAPK, catalase, MnSOD and Cu/Zn SOD protein expression. These results show that metformin has an antiproliferative effect associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, which is mediated by oxidative stress, as well as AMPK and FOXO3a activation. Our study further reinforces the potential benefit of metformin in cancer treatment and provides novel mechanistic insight into its antiproliferative role."
https://openalex.org/W2014708514,"GABA release from interneurons in VTA, projections from the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) was selectively activated in rat brain slices. The inhibition induced by μ-opioid agonists was pathway dependent. Morphine induced a 46% inhibition of IPSCs evoked from the RMTg, 18% from NAc, and IPSCs evoked from VTA interneurons were almost insensitive (11% inhibition). In vivo morphine treatment resulted in tolerance to the inhibition of RMTg, but not local interneurons or NAc, inputs. One common sign of opioid withdrawal is an increase in adenosine-dependent inhibition. IPSCs evoked from the NAc were potently inhibited by activation of presynaptic adenosine receptors, whereas IPSCs evoked from RMTg were not changed. Blockade of adenosine receptors selectively increased IPSCs evoked from the NAc during morphine withdrawal. Thus, the acute action of opioids, the development of tolerance, and the expression of withdrawal are mediated by separate GABA afferents to dopamine neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1976215621,"Vimentin is an intermediate filament protein whose expression correlates with increased metastatic disease, reduced patient survival and poor prognosis across multiple tumor types. Despite these well-characterized correlations, the molecular role of vimentin in cancer cell motility remains undefined. To approach this, we used an unbiased phosphoproteomics screen in lung cancer cell lines to discover cell motility proteins that show significant changes in phosphorylation upon vimentin depletion. We identified the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), VAV2, as having the greatest loss of phosphorylation owing to vimentin depletion. Since VAV2 serves as a GEF for the small Rho GTPase Rac1, a key player in cell motility and adhesion, we explored the vimentin-VAV2 pathway as a potential novel regulator of lung cancer cell motility. We show that VAV2 localizes to vimentin-positive focal adhesions (FAs) in lung cancer cells and complexes with vimentin and FA kinase (FAK). Vimentin loss impairs both pY142-VAV2 and downstream pY397-FAK activity showing that vimentin is critical for maintaining VAV2 and FAK activity. Importantly, vimentin depletion reduces the activity of the VAV2 target, Rac1, and a constitutively active Rac1 rescues defects in FAK and cell adhesion when vimentin or VAV2 is compromised. Based upon this data, we propose a model whereby vimentin promotes FAK stabilization through VAV2-mediated Rac1 activation. This model may explain why vimentin expressing metastatic lung cancer cells are more motile and invasive."
https://openalex.org/W2079484912,"Chemoresistance to platinums, such as cisplatin, is of critical concern in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Recent evidence has linked epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) as a contributing mechanism. The current study explored the connection between cellular responses to cisplatin and EMT in ovarian cancer. Expression microarrays were utilized to estimate the EMT status as a binary phenotype, and the transcriptional responses of 46 ovarian cancer cell lines to cisplatin were measured at dosages equivalent to 50% growth inhibition. Phenotypic responses to cisplatin were quantified with respect to cell number, proliferation rate and apoptosis, and then compared with the epithelial or mesenchymal status. Ovarian cancer cell lines with an epithelial status exhibited higher resistance to cisplatin treatment in the MTS assay than those with a mesenchymal status. Pathway analyses revealed the induction of G1/S- and S-phase genes (P=0.001) and the activation of multiple NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) downstream genes (P=0.0016) by cisplatin selectively in epithelial-like cell lines. BrdU incorporation and Caspase-3/7 release assays confirmed impaired apoptosis in epithelial-like ovarian cancer cells. In clinical samples, we observed resistance to single platinum treatment and the selective activation of the NF-κB pathway by platinum in ovarian cancers with an epithelial status. Overall, our results suggest that, in epithelial-like ovarian cancer cells, NF-κB activation by cisplatin may lead to defective apoptosis, preferential proliferation arrest and a consequential decreased sensitivity to cisplatin."
https://openalex.org/W2079945043,"Successful embryonic development is dependent on factors secreted by the reproductive tract. Dickkopf-1 (DKK1), an antagonist of the wingless-related mouse mammary tumor virus (WNT) signaling pathway, is one endometrial secretory protein potentially involved in maternal-embryo communication. The purpose of this study was to investigate the roles of DKK1 in embryo cell fate decisions and competence to establish pregnancy. Using in vitro-produced bovine embryos, we demonstrate that exposure of embryos to DKK1 during the period of morula to blastocyst transition (between d 5 and 8 of development) promotes the first 2 cell fate decisions leading to increased differentiation of cells toward the trophectoderm and hypoblast lineages compared with that for control embryos treated with vehicle. Moreover, treatment of embryos with DKK1 or colony-stimulating factor 2 (CSF2; an endometrial cytokine known to improve embryo development and pregnancy establishment) between d 5 and 7 of development improves embryo survival after transfer to recipients. Pregnancy success at d 32 of gestation was 27% for cows receiving control embryos treated with vehicle, 41% for cows receiving embryos treated with DKK1, and 39% for cows receiving embryos treated with CSF2. These novel findings represent the first evidence of a role for maternally derived WNT regulators during this period and could lead to improvements in assisted reproductive technologies."
https://openalex.org/W2136759971,"Background and Objectives There is increasing evidence that galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) and Gd-IgA1-containing immune complexes are important for the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). In the present study, we assessed a novel noninvasive multi-biomarker approach in the diagnostic test for IgAN. Materials and Methods We compared serum levels of IgA, IgG, Gd-IgA1, Gd-IgA1-specific IgG and Gd-IgA1-specific IgA in 135 IgAN patients, 79 patients with non-IgAN chronic kidney disease (CKD) controls and 106 healthy controls. Serum was collected at the time of kidney biopsy from all IgAN and CKD patients. Results Each serum marker was significantly elevated in IgAN patients compared to CKD (P<0.001) and healthy controls (P<0.001). While 41% of IgAN patients had elevated serum Gd-IgA1 levels, 91% of these patients exhibited Gd-IgA1-specific IgG levels above the 90th percentile for healthy controls (sensitivity 89%, specificity 92%). Although up to 25% of CKD controls, particularly those with immune-mediated glomerular diseases including lupus nephritis, also had elevated serum levels of Gd-IgA1-specific IgG, most IgAN patients had elevated levels of Gd-IgA1-specific antibody of both isotypes. Serum levels of Gd-IgA1-specific IgG were associated with renal histological grading. Furthermore, there was a trend toward higher serum levels of Gd-IgA1-specific IgG in IgAN patients with at least moderate proteinuria (≥1.0 g/g), compared to patients with less proteinuria. Conclusions Serum levels of Gd-IgA1-specific antibodies are elevated in most IgAN patients, and their assessment, together with serum levels of Gd-IgA1, improves the specificity of the assays. Our observations suggest that a panel of serum biomarkers may be helpful in differentiating IgAN from other glomerular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2084404626,"Pipes that transport drinking water through municipal drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) are challenging habitats for microorganisms. Distribution networks are dark, oligotrophic and contain disinfectants; yet microbes frequently form biofilms attached to interior surfaces of DWDS pipes. Relatively little is known about the species composition and ecology of these biofilms due to challenges associated with sample acquisition from actual DWDS. We report the analysis of biofilms from five pipe samples collected from the same region of a DWDS in Florida, USA, over an 18 month period between February 2011 and August 2012. The bacterial abundance and composition of biofilm communities within the pipes were analyzed by heterotrophic plate counts and tag pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes, respectively. Bacterial numbers varied significantly based on sampling date and were positively correlated with water temperature and the concentration of nitrate. However, there was no significant relationship between the concentration of disinfectant in the drinking water (monochloramine) and the abundance of bacteria within the biofilms. Pyrosequencing analysis identified a total of 677 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (3% distance) within the biofilms but indicated that community diversity was low and varied between sampling dates. Biofilms were dominated by a few taxa, specifically Methylomonas, Acinetobacter, Mycobacterium, and Xanthomonadaceae, and the dominant taxa within the biofilms varied dramatically between sampling times. The drinking water characteristics most strongly correlated with bacterial community composition were concentrations of nitrate, ammonium, total chlorine and monochloramine, as well as alkalinity and hardness. Biofilms from the sampling date with the highest nitrate concentration were the most abundant and diverse and were dominated by Acinetobacter."
https://openalex.org/W2040158754,"Approximately 70% of all newly diagnosed breast cancers express estrogen receptor (ER)-α. Although inhibiting ER action using targeted therapies such as fulvestrant (ICI) is often effective, later emergence of antiestrogen resistance limits clinical use. We used antiestrogen-sensitive and -resistant cells to determine the effect of antiestrogens/ERα on regulating autophagy and unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling. Knockdown of ERα significantly increased the sensitivity of LCC1 cells (sensitive) and also resensitized LCC9 cells (resistant) to antiestrogen drugs. Interestingly, ERα knockdown, but not ICI, reduced nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like (NRF)-2 (UPR-induced antioxidant protein) and increased cytosolic kelch-like ECH-associated protein (KEAP)-1 (NRF2 inhibitor), consistent with the observed increase in ROS production. Furthermore, autophagy induction by antiestrogens was prosurvival but did not prevent ERα knockdown-mediated death. We built a novel mathematical model to elucidate the interactions among UPR, autophagy, ER signaling, and ROS regulation of breast cancer cell survival. The experimentally validated mathematical model explains the counterintuitive result that knocking down the main target of ICI (ERα) increased the effectiveness of ICI. Specifically, the model indicated that ERα is no longer present in excess and that the effect on proliferation from further reductions in its level by ICI cannot be compensated for by increased autophagy. The stimulation of signaling that can confer resistance suggests that combining autophagy or UPR inhibitors with antiestrogens would reduce the development of resistance in some breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2099408190,"Only humans and higher primates have high uric acid blood levels. Although high uric acid causes gout, it has been linked with human longevity because of its hypothetical antioxidant function. Recent studies reveal that p53 has significant roles in cellular metabolism. One example of this is an antioxidant function that potentially contributes to tumor suppression. Here, we reported a first beneficial link between p53 and uric acid. We identified the uric acid transporter SLC2A9 (also known as GLUT9) as a direct p53 target gene and a key downstream effector in the reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through transporting uric acid as a source of antioxidant. Oxidative stress induced SLC2A9 expression in a p53-dependent manner, and inhibition of SLC2A9 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) or anti-gout drugs such as probenecid significantly increased ROS levels in an uric acid-dependent manner and greatly sensitized cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. Conversely, expression of SLC2A9 reduced ROS and protected against DNA damage and cell death, suggesting its antioxidant function. The increased production of ROS because of p53 loss was rescued by SLC2A9 expression. Furthermore, decreased SLC2A9 expression was observed in several cancer types and was associated with a poorer prognosis. Our findings suggest that the p53-SLC2A9 pathway is a novel antioxidant mechanism that uses uric acid to maintain ROS homeostasis and prevent accumulation of ROS-associated damage that potentially contributes to cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2053248895,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal of all gynecological cancers, and encompasses distinct histological subtypes that have specific genetic and tissues-of-origin differences. Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) represents approximately 10% of cases and has been termed a stress responsive cancer. OCCC is characterized by increased expression of oxidative stress and glycolysis-related genes. In the present study, we hypothesized that bioenergetic profiling might uniquely distinguish OCCC from other EOC histological subtypes. Using an extracellular flux analyzer, OCCC lines (ES-2, TOV-21-G) were shown to be highly metabolically active, with high oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and high extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), indicative of enhanced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and glycolytic rate, respectively. A high bioenergetics profile was associated with the cell lines' ability to form anchorage independent spheroids. Given their high glycolytic and mitochondrial activity, OCCC cells displayed strong sensitivity to 2-deoxy-D-glucose and Rotenone growth inhibition, although this chemosensitivity profile was not specific to only OCCC cells. Bioenergetic profiling also identified a non-OCCC cell line, OVCA420, to have severely compromised mitochondrial function, based on low OCR and a lack of stimulation of maximal respiration following application of the uncoupler FCCP. This was accompanied by mitochondrial morphology changes indicative of enhanced fission, increased expression of the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1, a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and dependence on glycolysis. Importantly, this loss of mitochondrial function was accompanied by the inability of OVCA420 cells to cope with hypoxic stress, and a compromised ability to stabilize HIF-1α in response to 1% O2 hypoxia. This knowledge may be imperative for researchers planning to utilize this cell line for further studies of metabolism and hypoxia, and suggests that altered mitochondrial fission dynamics represents a phenotype of a subpopulation of EOCs."

We set out to test this mechanism taking advantage of the new methods for imaging the macula with high resolution by optical coherence tomography (OCT) in patients with lesions in the posterior visual pathway. Additionally, we explored the association between thinning of GCL as an imaging marker of visual impairment such as visual field defects. Methods Retrospective case note review of patients with retrogeniculate lesions studied by spectral domain OCT of the macula and quadrant pattern deviation (PD) of the visual fields. Results We analysed 8 patients with either hemianopia or quadrantanopia due to brain lesions (stroke = 5; surgery = 2; infection = 1). We found significant thinning of the GCL in the projecting sector of the retina mapping to the brain lesion. Second, we found strong correlation between the PD of the visual field quadrant and the corresponding macular GCL sector for the right (R = 0.792, p<0.001) and left eyes (R = 0.674, p<0.001). Conclusions The mapping between lesions in the posterior visual pathway and their projection in the macula GCL sector corroborates retrograde trans-synaptic neuronal degeneration after brain injury as a mechanism of damage with functional consequences. This finding supports the use of GCL thickness as an imaging marker of trans-synaptic degeneration in the visual pathway after brain lesions."

To better understand the mechanisms behind how maize responds to phosphate stress, we compared the proteome analysis results of two groups of maize leaves that were treated separately with 1,000 µM (control, +P) and 5 µM of KH2PO4 (intervention group, -P) for 25 days. In total, 1,342 protein spots were detected on 2-DE maps and 15.43% had changed (P<0.05; ≥1.5-fold) significantly in quantity between the +P and -P groups. These proteins are involved in several major metabolic pathways, including photosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, secondary metabolism, signal transduction, protein synthesis, cell rescue and cell defense and virulence. The results showed that the reduction in photosynthesis under low phosphorus treatment was due to the down-regulation of the proteins involved in CO2 enrichment, the Calvin cycle and the electron transport system. Electron transport and photosynthesis restrictions resulted in a large accumulation of peroxides. Maize has developed many different reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging mechanisms to cope with low phosphorus stress, including up-regulating its antioxidant content and antioxidase activity. After being subjected to phosphorus stress over a long period, maize may increase its internal phosphorus utilization efficiency by altering photorespiration, starch synthesis and lipid composition. These results provide important information about how maize responds to low phosphorus stress."

In this study, we studied the expression of miR-20a in normal, benign and malignant thyroid samples, and its effect on thyroid cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Methodology/Principal Findings The expression of miR-20a in normal, benign and malignant thyroid tissue was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Thyroid cancer cells were transfected with miR-20a and the effect on cellular proliferation, tumor spheroid formation, and invasion was evaluated. Target genes of miR-20 were determined by genome-wide mRNA expression analysis with miR-20a overexpression in thyroid cancer cells and target prediction database. Target genes were validated by quantitative PCR and immunoblotting, and luciferase assays. MiR-20a expression was significantly higher in anaplastic thyroid cancer than in differentiated thyroid cancer, and benign and normal thyroid tissues. MiR-20a significantly inhibited thyroid cancer cell proliferation in vitro (p<0.01) and in vivo (p<0.01), tumor spheroid formation (p<0.05) and invasion (p<0.05) in multiple thyroid cancer cell lines. We found that LIMK1 was a target of miR-20a in thyroid cancer cell lines and direct knockdown of LIMK1 recapitulated the effect of miR-20a in thyroid cancer cells. Conclusions/Significance To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that miR-20a plays a role as a tumor suppressor in thyroid cancer cells and targets LIMK1. Our findings suggest the upregulated expression of miR-20a in anaplastic thyroid cancer counteracts thyroid cancer progression and may have therapeutic potential."

If grapes from a given terroir are assumed to reflect this origin in their chemical compositions, the corresponding wine should also reflect it. The aim of this work was therefore to reveal the ""terroir"" expression within the chemodiversity of grapes and related wines, using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry. Grapes and corresponding wines, from two distinct - though very proximate - terroirs of Burgundy were analyzed over three vintages (2010, 2011 and 2012). Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography were used as untargeted and targeted approaches to discriminate complex chemical fingerprints for vintages, classes (wines, skins or musts), and terroirs. Statistical analyses revealed that even if vintages have the most significant impact on fingerprints, the most significant terroir differences are seen in the grapes of a given vintage."
https://openalex.org/W2163774896,"Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a major foodborne human pathogen causing disease worldwide. Cattle are a major reservoir for this pathogen and those that shed E. coli O157:H7 at >104 CFU/g feces have been termed “super-shedders”. A rich microbial community inhabits the mammalian intestinal tract, but it is not known if the structure of this community differs between super-shedder cattle and their non-shedding pen mates. We hypothesized that the super-shedder state is a result of an intestinal dysbiosis of the microbial community and that a “normal” microbiota prevents E. coli O157:H7 from reaching super-shedding levels. To address this question, we applied 454 pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes to characterize fecal bacterial communities from 11 super-shedders and 11 contemporary pen mates negative for E. coli O157:H7. The dataset was analyzed by using five independent clustering methods to minimize potential biases and to increase confidence in the results. Our analyses collectively indicated significant variations in microbiome composition between super-shedding and non-shedding cattle. Super-shedders exhibited higher bacterial richness and diversity than non-shedders. Furthermore, seventy-two operational taxonomic units, mostly belonging to Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla, were identified showing differential abundance between these two groups of cattle. The operational taxonomic unit affiliation provides new insight into bacterial populations that are present in feces arising from super-shedders of E. coli O157:H7."
https://openalex.org/W1981528089,"Phytophthora sojae, an oomycete pathogen, produces a large number of effector proteins that enter into host cells. The Crinklers (Crinkling and Necrosis, CRN) are cytoplasmic effectors that are conserved in oomycete pathogens and their encoding genes are highly expressed at the infective stages in P. sojae. However, their roles in pathogenesis are largely unknown. Here, we functionally characterized an effector PsCRN70 by transiently and stably overexpressing it in Nicotiana benthamiana. We demonstrated that PsCRN70 was localized to the plant cell nucleus and suppressed cell death elicited by all the tested cell death-inducing proteins, including BAX, PsAvh241, PsCRN63, PsojNIP and R3a/Avr3a. Overexpression of the PsCRN70 gene in N. benthamiana enhanced susceptibility to P. parasitica. The H2O2 accumulation in the PsCRN70-transgenic plants was reduced compared to the GFP-lines. The transcriptional levels of the defense-associated genes, including PR1b, PR2b, ERF1 and LOX, were also down-regulated in the PsCRN70-transgenic lines. Our results suggest that PsCRN70 may function as a universal suppressor of the cell death induced by many elicitors, the host H2O2 accumulation and the expression of defense-associated genes, and therefore promotes pathogen infection."
https://openalex.org/W2086797350,"MicroRNAs (miRs) are noncoding RNAs (17-25 nt) that control translation and/or mRNA degradation. Using Northern blot analysis, we identified that miR-1 is specifically expressed in growth plate cartilage in addition to muscle tissue, but not in brain, intestine, liver, or lung. We obtained the first evidence that miR-1 is highly expressed in the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate, with an 8-fold increase compared with the proliferation zone; this location coincides with the Ihh and Col X expression regions in vivo. MiR-1 significantly induces chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. We further identified histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) as a target of miR-1. HDAC4 negatively regulates chondrocyte hypertrophy by inhibiting Runx2, a critical transcription factor for chondrocyte hypertrophy. MiR-1 inhibits both endogenous HDAC4 protein by 2.2-fold and the activity of a reporter gene bearing the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of HDAC4 by 3.3-fold. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous miR-1 relieves the repression of HDAC4. Deletion of the miR-1 binding site in HDAC4 3'-UTR or mutated miR-1 abolishes miR-1-mediated inhibition of the reporter gene activity. Overexpression of HDAC4 reverses miR-1 induction of chondrocyte differentiation markers Col X and Ihh. HDAC4 inhibits Runx2 promoter activity in a dosage-dependent manner. Thus, miR-1 plays an important role in the regulation of the chondrocyte phenotype during the growth plate development via direct targeting of HDAC4."
https://openalex.org/W2023405006,"Pregnancy is a known risk factor for malaria which is associated with increased maternal and infant mortality and morbidity in areas of moderate-high malaria transmission intensity where Plasmodium falciparum predominates. The nature and impact of malaria, however, is not well understood in pregnant women residing in areas of low, unstable malaria transmission where P. falciparum and P. vivax co-exist.A large longitudinal active surveillance study of malaria was conducted in the Chittagong Hill Districts of Bangladesh. Over 32 months in 2010-2013, the period prevalence of asymptomatic P. falciparum infections was assessed by rapid diagnostic test and blood smear and compared among men, non-pregnant women and pregnant women. A subset of samples was tested for infection by PCR. Hemoglobin was assessed. Independent risk factors for malaria infection were determined using a multivariate logistic regression model.Total of 34 asymptomatic P. falciparum infections were detected by RDT/smear from 3,110 tests. The period prevalence of asymptomatic P. falciparum infection in pregnant women was 2.3%, compared to 0.5% in non-pregnant women and 0.9% in men. All RDT/smear positive samples that were tested by PCR were PCR-positive, and PCR detected additional 35 infections that were RDT/smear negative. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, pregnant women had 5.4-fold higher odds of infection as compared to non-pregnant women. Malaria-positive pregnant women, though asymptomatic, had statistically lower hemoglobin than those without malaria or pregnancy. Asymptomatic malaria was found to be evenly distributed across space and time, in contrast to symptomatic infections which tend to cluster.Pregnancy is a risk factor for asymptomatic P. falciparum infection in the Chittagong Hill Districts of Bangladesh, and pregnancy and malaria interact to heighten the effect of each on hemoglobin. The even distribution of asymptomatic malaria, without temporal and spatial clustering, may have critical implications for malaria elimination strategies."
https://openalex.org/W1966668504,"Cancer metastasis is a complex process involving cell-cell interactions mediated by cell adhesive molecules. In this study we determine the adhesion strength between an endothelial cell monolayer and tumor cells of different metastatic potentials using Atomic Force Microscopy. We show that the rupture forces of receptor-ligand bonds increase with retraction speed and range between 20 and 70 pN. It is shown that the most invasive cell lines (T24, J82) form the strongest bonds with endothelial cells. Using ICAM-1 coated substrates and a monoclonal antibody specific for ICAM-1, we demonstrate that ICAM-1 serves as a key receptor on endothelial cells and that its interactions with ligands expressed by tumor cells are correlated with the rupture forces obtained with the most invasive cancer cells (T24, J82). For the less invasive cancer cells (RT112), endothelial ICAM-1 does not seem to play any role in the adhesion process. Moreover, a detailed analysis of the distribution of rupture forces suggests that ICAM-1 interacts preferentially with one ligand on T24 cancer cells and with two ligands on J82 cancer cells. Possible counter receptors for these interactions are CD43 and MUC1, two known ligands for ICAM-1 which are expressed by these cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2030008286,"Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are key molecules that mediate neuropathic pain. Although hydrogen is an established antioxidant, its effect on chronic pain has not been characterized. This study was to investigate the efficacy and mechanisms of hydrogen-rich normal saline induced analgesia.In a rat model of neuropathic pain induced by L5 spinal nerve ligation (L5 SNL), intrathecal injection of hydrogen-rich normal saline relieved L5 SNL-induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Importantly, repeated administration of hydrogen-rich normal saline did not lead to tolerance. Preemptive treatment with hydrogen-rich normal saline prevented development of neuropathic pain behavior. Immunofluorochrome analysis revealed that hydrogen-rich normal saline treatment significantly attenuated L5 SNL-induced increase of 8-hydroxyguanosine immunoreactive cells in the ipsilateral spinal dorsal horn. Western blot analysis of SDS/PAGE-fractionated tyrosine-nitrated proteins showed that L5 SNL led to increased expression of tyrosine-nitrated Mn-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in the spinal cord, and hydrogen-rich normal saline administration reversed the tyrosine-nitrated MnSOD overexpression. We also showed that the analgesic effect of hydrogen-rich normal saline was associated with decreased activation of astrocytes and microglia, attenuated expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the spinal cord.Intrathecal injection of hydrogen-rich normal saline produced analgesic effect in neuropathic rat. Hydrogen-rich normal saline-induced analgesia in neuropathic rats is mediated by reducing the activation of spinal astrocytes and microglia, which is induced by overproduction of hydroxyl and peroxynitrite."
https://openalex.org/W2022526122,"Abnormal patterns of DNA methylation are one of the hallmarks of cancer cells. The process of aging has also been associated with similar, albeit less dramatic, changes in methylation patterns, leading to the hypothesis that age-related changes in DNA methylation may partially underlie the increased risk of cancer in the elderly. Here we studied 377 participants aged 85 yr from the Newcastle 85+ Study to investigate the extent of, and interindividual variation in, age-related changes in DNA methylation at specific CpG islands. Using highly quantitative pyrosequencing analysis, we found extensive and highly variable methylation of promoter-associated CpG islands with levels ranging from 4% to 35%, even at known tumor suppressor genes such as TWIST2. Furthermore, the interindividual differences in methylation seen across this elderly population phenocopies multiple features of the altered methylation patterns seen in cancer cells. Both aging- and cancer-related methylation can occur at similar sets of genes, both result in the formation of densely methylated, and likely transcriptionally repressed, alleles, and both exhibit coordinate methylation across multiple loci. In addition, high methylation levels were associated with subsequent diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma during a 3-yr follow-up period (P=0.00008). These data suggest that the accumulation of age-related changes in promoter-associated CpG islands may contribute to the increased cancer risk seen during aging.-Gautrey, H. E., van Otterdijk, S. D., Cordell, H. J., Newcastle 85+ study core team, Mathers, J. C., Strathdee, G. DNA methylation abnormalities at gene promoters are extensive and variable in the elderly and phenocopy cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2051385844,"miR-200a has been implicated in the pathogenesis of meningiomas, one of the most common central nervous system tumors in humans. To identify how miR-200a contributes to meningioma pathogenesis at the molecular level, we used a comparative protein profiling approach using Gel-nanoLC-MS/MS and identified approximately 130 dysregulated proteins in miR-200a-overexpressing meningioma cells. Following the bioinformatic analysis to identify potential genes targeted by miR-200a, we focused on the non-muscle heavy chain IIb (NMHCIIb), and showed that miR-200a directly targeted NMHCIIb. Considering the key roles of NMHCIIb in cell division and cell migration, we aimed to identify whether miR-200a regulated these processes through NMHCIIb. We found that NMHCIIb overexpression partially rescued miR-200a-mediated inhibition of cell migration, as well as cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, siRNA-mediated silencing of NMHCIIb expression resulted in a similar migration phenotype in these cells and inhibited meningioma tumor growth in mice. Taken together, these results suggest that NMHCIIb might serve as a novel therapeutic target in meningiomas."
https://openalex.org/W1998790126,"Presenilins are the enzymatic components of γ-secretase complex that cleaves amyloid precursor protein, Notch and β-catenin, which has critical roles in the development of Alzheimer's disease and cancer cell growth. Therefore, in the present study, we studied the effects and mechanisms of PS2 knockout on lung cancer development and possible mechanisms as a key regulator of lung tumor development. We compared carcinogen-induced tumor growth between PS2 knockout mice and wild-type mice. PS2 knockout mice showed increased urethane (1 mg/g)-induced lung tumor incidence when compared with that of wild-type mice with decreased activity of γ-secretase in the lung tumor tissues. Consequently, iPLA2 activities in lung tumor tissues of PS2 knockout mice were much higher than in tumor tissues of wild-type mice. Furthermore, knockdown of PS2 using PS2 siRNA decreased γ-secretase activity with increased iPLA2 activity in the lung cancer cells (A549 and NCI-H460), leading to increased lung cancer cell growth. PS2 knockout mice and PS2 knockdown lung cancer cells showed increased DNA-binding activities of nuclear factor kappa-beta, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and AP-1 which are critical transcriptional factors of iPLA2 than those of PS2 wild-type mice and control lung cancer cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the loss of PS2 could have a critical role in lung tumor development through the upregulation of iPLA2 activity by reducing γ-secretase."
https://openalex.org/W2064466992,"Although the infiltrative behavior of malignant gliomas is one of their most critical aspects, the mechanisms underlying it have not yet been elucidated. To migrate in the brain parenchyma, malignant glioma cells need to bypass the cell–cell contact inhibitory signals. Here we propose that the blinding of cell–cell contact sensing in gliomas is caused by an unusual mechanism of cadherin switch, involving the replacement of N-cadherin with R-cadherin (Rcad) at the cell–cell junctions and the activation of ERK and p27. In our model of malignant glioma, we found that Rcad expression is necessary and sufficient to release cells from contact inhibition of proliferation, and is necessary, although not sufficient, for overriding contact inhibition of migration and for tumorigenicity. Altogether, these observations suggest that Rcad is a potential target for malignant glioma therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2065155364,"Background We confirmed that the filaggrin gene mutation c.3321delA is associated with atopic dermatitis in our previous genome wide association study of the Chinese Han population. c.3321delA is the most common filaggrin gene mutation in Chinese atopic dermatitis patients but is not present in European populations. Objective To investigate the genetic model for the c.3321delA mutation and to determine the correlation between c.3321delA and atopic dermatitis clinical phenotypes in the Chinese Han population. Method The filaggrin gene mutation c.3321delA was sequenced in 1,080 atopic dermatitis patients and 908 controls from the Chinese population. The χ2 test, ANOVA,nonparametric tests and logistic regression were used to investigate the relationship between the c.3321delA genotype and atopic dermatitis clinical phenotypes in the Chinese Han population. Results Analyses of the genetic model revealed that the additive model best described the c.3321delA mutation (P = 3.09E-11, OR = 3.43, 95%CI = 2.38–4.96). Stratified analyses showed that the c.3321delA allele frequency distribution is significantly associated with concomitant skin xerosis (P = 1.68E-03, OR = 2.13,95%CI = 1.32–3.46), palmar hyperlinearity (P = 3.64E-17, OR = 4.0,95%CI = 2.86–5.70), white dermatographism (P = 4.25E-03, OR = 1.82,95%CI = 1.22–2.71), food intolerance (P = 1.51E-03, OR = 1.76,95%CI = 1.23–2.50) and disease severity ( P = 9.67E-05). Conclusion Our study indicates that the filaggrin gene mutation c.3321delA is associated with clinical phenotypes of atopic dermatitis in the Chinese Han population, which might help us gain a better understanding on the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis."
https://openalex.org/W1975418566,"Background Ischemic stroke is the combinatorial effect of many pathological processes including the loss of energy supplies, excessive intracellular calcium accumulation, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses. The brain's ability to maintain energy demand through this process involves metabolism of glycogen, which is critical for release of stored glucose. However, regulation of glycogen metabolism in ischemic stroke remains unknown. In the present study, we investigate the role and regulation of glycogen metabolizing enzymes and their effects on the fate of glycogen during ischemic stroke. Results Ischemic stroke was induced in rats by peri-vascular application of the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 and forebrains were collected at 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours post-stroke. Glycogen levels and the expression and activity of enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism were analyzed. We found elevated glycogen levels in the ipsilateral hemispheres compared with contralateral hemispheres at 6 and 24 hours (25% and 39% increase respectively; P<0.05). Glycogen synthase activity and glycogen branching enzyme expression were found to be similar between the ipsilateral, contralateral, and sham control hemispheres. In contrast, the rate-limiting enzyme for glycogen breakdown, glycogen phosphorylase, had 58% lower activity (P<0.01) in the ipsilateral hemisphere (24 hours post-stroke), which corresponded with a 48% reduction in cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) activity (P<0.01). In addition, glycogen debranching enzyme expression 24 hours post-stroke was 77% (P<0.01) and 72% lower (P<0.01) at the protein and mRNA level, respectively. In cultured rat primary cerebellar astrocytes, hypoxia and inhibition of PKA activity significantly reduced glycogen phosphorylase activity and increased glycogen accumulation but did not alter glycogen synthase activity. Furthermore, elevated glycogen levels provided metabolic support to astrocytes during hypoxia. Conclusion Our study has identified that glycogen breakdown is impaired during ischemic stroke, the molecular basis of which includes reduced glycogen debranching enzyme expression level together with reduced glycogen phosphorylase and PKA activity."
https://openalex.org/W1994472120,"FATP1 mediates skeletal muscle cell fatty acid import, yet its intracellular localization and metabolic control role are not completely defined. Here, we examine FATP1 localization and metabolic effects of its overexpression in mouse skeletal muscle. The FATP1 protein was detected in mitochondrial and plasma membrane fractions, obtained by differential centrifugation, of mouse gastrocnemius muscle. FATP1 was most abundant in purified mitochondria, and in the outer membrane and soluble intermembrane, but not in the inner membrane plus matrix, enriched subfractions of purified mitochondria. Immunogold electron microscopy localized FATP1-GFP in mitochondria of transfected C2C12 myotubes. FATP1 was overexpressed in gastrocnemius mouse muscle, by adenovirus-mediated delivery of the gene into hindlimb muscles of newborn mice, fed after weaning a chow or high-fat diet. Compared to GFP delivery, FATP1 did not alter body weight, serum fed glucose, insulin and triglyceride levels, and whole-body glucose tolerance, in either diet. However, fatty acid levels were lower and β-hydroxybutyrate levels were higher in FATP1- than GFP-mice, irrespective of diet. Moreover, intramuscular triglyceride content was lower in FATP1- versus GFP-mice regardless of diet, and β-hydroxybutyrate content was unchanged in high-fat-fed mice. Electroporation-mediated FATP1 overexpression enhanced palmitate oxidation to CO2, but not to acid-soluble intermediate metabolites, while CO2 production from β-hydroxybutyrate was inhibited and that from glucose unchanged, in isolated mouse gastrocnemius strips. In summary, FATP1 was localized in mitochondria, in the outer membrane and intermembrane parts, of mouse skeletal muscle, what may be crucial for its metabolic effects. Overexpressed FATP1 enhanced disposal of both systemic fatty acids and intramuscular triglycerides. Consistently, it did not contribute to the high-fat diet-induced metabolic dysregulation. However, FATP1 lead to hyperketonemia, likely secondary to the sparing of ketone body oxidation by the enhanced oxidation of fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W2085280095,"The Dlx5 and Dlx6 genes encode homeodomain transcription factors essential for the proper development of limbs in mammalian species. However, the role of their teleost counterparts in fin development has received little attention. Here, we show that dlx5a is an early marker of apical ectodermal cells of the pectoral fin buds and of the median fin fold, but also of cleithrum precursor cells during pectoral girdle development. We propose that early median fin fold establishment results from the medial convergence of dlx5a-expressing cells at the lateral edges of the neural keel. Expression analysis also shows involvement of dlx5a during appendage skeletogenesis. Using morpholino-mediated knock down, we demonstrate that disrupted dlx5a/6a function results in pectoral fin agenesis associated with misexpression of bmp4, fgf8a, and1 and msx genes. In contrast, the median fin fold presents defects in mesenchymal cell migration and actinotrichia formation, whereas the initial specification seems to occur normally. Our results demonstrate that the dlx5a/6a genes are essential for the induction of pectoral fin outgrowth, but are not required during median fin fold specification. The dlx5a/6a knock down also causes a failure of cleithrum formation associated with a drastic loss of runx2b and col10a1 expression. The data indicate distinct requirements for dlx5a/6a during median and pectoral fin development suggesting that initiation of unpaired and paired fin formation are not directed through the same molecular mechanisms. Our results refocus arguments on the mechanistic basis of paired appendage genesis during vertebrate evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2009984937,"Multinucleation is associated with malignant neoplasms; however, the molecular mechanism underlying the nuclear abnormality remains unclear. Loss or mutation of PTEN promotes the development of malignant tumors. We now demonstrate that increased expression of the oncogene MCT-1 (multiple copies in T-cell malignancy 1) antagonizes PTEN gene presentation, PTEN protein stability and PTEN functional activity, thereby further promoting phosphoinositide 3 kinase/AKT signaling, survival rate and malignancies of the PTEN-deficient cells. In the PTEN-null cancer cells, MCT-1 interacts with p190B and Src in vivo, supporting that they are in proximity of the signaling complexes. MCT-1 overexpression and PTEN loss synergistically augments the Src/p190B signaling function that leads to inhibition of RhoA activity. Under such a condition, the incidence of mitotic catastrophes including spindle multipolarity and cytokinesis failure is enhanced, driving an Src/p190B/RhoA-dependent neoplastic multinucleation. Targeting MCT-1 by the short hairpin RNA markedly represses the Src/p190B function, improves nuclear structures and suppresses xenograft tumorigenicity of the PTEN-null breast cancer cells. Consistent with the oncogenic effects in vitro, clinical evidence has confirmed that MCT-1 gene stimulation is correlated with p190B gene promotion and PTEN gene suppression in human breast cancer. Accordingly, MCT-1 gene induction is recognized as a potential biomarker of breast tumor development. Abrogating MCT-1 function may be a promising stratagem for management of breast cancer involving Src hyperactivation and/or PTEN dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2010669667,"Genomic analyses revealed that many cancers have acquired abnormalities in their expression of pro- or anti-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 protein family. It is, however, unknown whether changes in pro- or anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members have similar impact on tumorigenesis or whether changes in one subgroup have disproportionate impact. We compared the consequences of concomitant loss of anti-apoptotic Bclx and pro-apoptotic Bim on MYC-induced lymphomagenesis. Whereas only loss of both Bclx alleles markedly forestalled tumorigenesis, loss of a single Bim allele overcame this blockade. Conversely, loss of even a single Bim allele sufficed to substantially accelerate lymphomagenesis, and only loss of both but not loss of a single allele of Bclx could attenuate this acceleration. The evidence that modest (two-fold) monoallelic changes in the expression of at least some BH3-only proteins can profoundly impact tumorigenesis suggests that such aberrations, imposed by epigenetic or genetic changes, may expedite tumorigenesis more effectively than elevated expression of pro-survival BCL-2 family members. These findings further our understanding of the mechanisms of lymphomagenesis and possibly also cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2074122857,"Road mortality is thought to be a leading cause of turtle population decline. However, empirical evidence of the direct negative effects of road mortality on turtle population abundance is lacking. The purpose of this study was to provide a strong test of the prediction that roads reduce turtle population abundance. While controlling for potentially confounding variables, we compared relative abundance of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) in 20 ponds in Eastern Ontario, 10 as close as possible to high traffic roads (Road sites) and 10 as far as possible from any major roads (No Road sites). There was no significant effect of roads on painted turtle relative abundance. Furthermore, our data do not support other predictions of the road mortality hypothesis; we observed neither a higher relative frequency of males to females at Road sites than at No Road sites, nor a lower average body size of turtles at Road than at No Road sites. We speculate that, although roads can cause substantial adult mortality in turtles, other factors, such as release from predation on adults and/or nests close to roads counter the negative effect of road mortality in some populations. We suggest that road mitigation for painted turtles can be limited to locations where turtles are forced to migrate across high traffic roads due, for example, to destruction of local nesting habitat or seasonal drying of ponds. This conclusion should not be extrapolated to other species of turtles, where road mortality could have a larger population-level effect than on painted turtles."
https://openalex.org/W1993115734,"Background There is hardly evidence on maintenance treatment with antidepressants in primary care. Nevertheless, depression guidelines recommend maintenance treatment i.e. treatment to prevent recurrences, in patients with high risk of recurrence, and many patients use maintenance treatment with antidepressants. This study explores the characteristics of patients on maintenance treatment with antidepressants in general practice, and compares these characteristics with guideline recommendations for maintenance treatment. Methods We used data (baseline, two-year and four-year follow-up) of primary care respondents with remitted depressive disorder (≥6 months) from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (n = 776). Maintenance treatment was defined as the use of an antidepressant for ≥12 months. Multilevel logistic regression was used to describe the association between sociodemographic, clinical and care characteristics and use of maintenance treatment with antidepressants. Results Older patients, patients with a lower education, those using benzodiazepines or receiving psychological/psychiatric care and patients with a concurrent history of a dysthymic or anxiety disorder more often received maintenance treatment with antidepressants. Limitations Measurements were not made at the start of an episode, but at predetermined points in time. Diagnoses were based on interview (CIDI) data and could therefore in some cases have been different from the GP diagnosis. Conclusions Since patients with chronic or recurrent depression do not use maintenance treatment with antidepressants more often, characteristics of patients on maintenance treatment do not fully correspond with guideline recommendations. However, patients on maintenance treatment appear to be those with more severe disorder and/or more comorbidity."
https://openalex.org/W2057347219,"In bats, the wing membrane is anchored not only to the body and forelimb, but also to the hindlimb. This attachment configuration gives bats the potential to modulate wing shape by moving the hindlimb, such as by joint movement at the hip or knee. Such movements could modulate lift, drag, or the pitching moment. In this study we address: 1) how the ankle translates through space during the wingbeat cycle; 2) whether amplitude of ankle motion is dependent upon flight speed; 3) how tension in the wing membrane pulls the ankle; and 4) whether wing membrane tension is responsible for driving ankle motion. We flew five individuals of the lesser dog-faced fruit bat, Cynopterus brachyotis (Family: Pteropodidae), in a wind tunnel and documented kinematics of the forelimb, hip, ankle, and trailing edge of the wing membrane. Based on kinematic analysis of hindlimb and forelimb movements, we found that: 1) during downstroke, the ankle moved ventrally and during upstroke the ankle moved dorsally; 2) there was considerable variation in amplitude of ankle motion, but amplitude did not correlate significantly with flight speed; 3) during downstroke, tension generated by the wing membrane acted to pull the ankle dorsally, and during upstroke, the wing membrane pulled laterally when taut and dorsally when relatively slack; and 4) wing membrane tension generally opposed dorsoventral ankle motion. We conclude that during forward flight in C. brachyotis, wing membrane tension does not power hindlimb motion; instead, we propose that hindlimb movements arise from muscle activity and/or inertial effects."

TU-100 includes ginger, ginseng, and Japanese pepper, each component possessing bioactive properties. The effects of TU-100 and individual components were investigated in a model of intestinal T lymphocyte activation using anti-CD3 antibody. To determine contribution of intestinal bacteria, specific pathogen free (SPF) and germ free (GF) mice were used. TU-100 or its components were delivered by diet or by gavage. Anti-CD3 antibody increased jejunal accumulation of fluid, increased TNFα, and induced intestinal epithelial apoptosis in both SPF and GF mice, which was blocked by either TU-100 or ginger, but not by ginseng or Japanese pepper. TU-100 and ginger also blocked anti-CD3-stimulated Akt and NF-κB activation. A co-culture system of colonic Caco2BBE and Jurkat-1 cells was used to examine T-lymphocyte/epithelial cells interactions. Jurkat-1 cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 to produce TNFα that activates epithelial cell NF-κB. TU-100 and ginger blocked anti-CD3 antibody activation of Akt in Jurkat cells, decreasing their TNFα production. Additionally, TU-100 and ginger alone blocked direct TNFα stimulation of Caco2BBE cells and decreased activation of caspase-3 and polyADP ribose. The present studies demonstrate a new anti-inflammatory action of TU-100 that is microbe-independent and due to its ginger component."
https://openalex.org/W1991341392,"Sponges and bacteria have lived together in complex consortia for 700 million years. As filter feeders, sponges prey on bacteria. Nevertheless, some bacteria are associated with sponges in symbiotic relationships. To enable this association, sponges and bacteria are likely to have developed molecular communication systems. These may include molecules such as N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones, produced by Gram-negative bacteria also within sponges. In this study, we examined the role of N-3-oxododecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C12-HSL) on the expression of immune and apoptotic genes of the host sponge Suberites domuncula. This molecule seemed to inhibit the sponge innate immune system through a decrease of the expression of genes coding for proteins sensing the bacterial membrane: a Toll-Like Receptor and a Toll-like Receptor Associated Factor 6 and for an anti-bacterial perforin-like molecule. The expression of the pro-apoptotic caspase-like 3/7 gene decreased as well, whereas the level of mRNA of anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-2 Homolog Proteins did not change. Then, we demonstrated the differential expression of proteins in presence of this 3-oxo-C12-HSL using 3D sponge cell cultures. Proteins involved in the first steps of the endocytosis process were highlighted using the 2D electrophoresis protein separation and the MALDI-TOF/TOF protein characterization: α and β subunits of the lysosomal ATPase, a cognin, cofilins-related proteins and cytoskeleton proteins actin, α tubulin and α actinin. The genetic expression of some of these proteins was subsequently followed. We propose that the 3-oxo-C12-HSL may participate in the tolerance of the sponge apoptotic and immune systems towards the presence of bacteria. Besides, the sponge may sense the 3-oxo-C12-HSL as a molecular evidence of the bacterial presence and/or density in order to regulate the populations of symbiotic bacteria in the sponge. This study is the first report of a bacterial secreted molecule acting on sponge cells and regulating the symbiotic relationship."
https://openalex.org/W2059453871,"Objective In vascular biology, endothelial KCa2.3 and KCa3.1 channels contribute to arterial blood pressure regulation by producing membrane hyperpolarization and smooth muscle relaxation. The role of KCa2.3 and KCa3.1 channels in the pulmonary circulation is not fully established. Using mice with genetically encoded deficit of KCa2.3 and KCa3.1 channels, this study investigated the effect of loss of the channels in hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. Approach and Result Male wild type and KCa3.1−/−/KCa2.3T/T(+DOX) mice were exposed to chronic hypoxia for four weeks to induce pulmonary hypertension. The degree of pulmonary hypertension was evaluated by right ventricular pressure and assessment of right ventricular hypertrophy. Segments of pulmonary arteries were mounted in a wire myograph for functional studies and morphometric studies were performed on lung sections. Chronic hypoxia induced pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy, increased lung weight, and increased hematocrit levels in either genotype. The KCa3.1−/−/KCa2.3T/T(+DOX) mice developed structural alterations in the heart with increased right ventricular wall thickness as well as in pulmonary vessels with increased lumen size in partially- and fully-muscularized vessels and decreased wall area, not seen in wild type mice. Exposure to chronic hypoxia up-regulated the gene expression of the KCa2.3 channel by twofold in wild type mice and increased by 2.5-fold the relaxation evoked by the KCa2.3 and KCa3.1 channel activator NS309, whereas the acetylcholine-induced relaxation - sensitive to the combination of KCa2.3 and KCa3.1 channel blockers, apamin and charybdotoxin - was reduced by 2.5-fold in chronic hypoxic mice of either genotype. Conclusion Despite the deficits of the KCa2.3 and KCa3.1 channels failed to change hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension, the up-regulation of KCa2.3-gene expression and increased NS309-induced relaxation in wild-type mice point to a novel mechanism to counteract pulmonary hypertension and to a potential therapeutic utility of KCa2.3/KCa3.1 activators for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W1980294288,"Background Puumala virus (PUUV) is the most important hantavirus species in Central Europe. Nephropathia epidemica (NE), caused by PUUV, is characterized by acute renal injury (AKI) with thrombocytopenia and frequently gastrointestinal symptoms. Methods 456 patients with serologically and clinically confirmed NE were investigated at time of follow-up in a single clinic. The course of the NE was investigated using medical reports. We identified patients who had endoscopy with intestinal biopsy during acute phase of NE. Histopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular analyses of the biopsies were performed. Results Thirteen patients underwent colonoscopy or gastroscopy for abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting during acute phase of NE. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed PUUV nucleocapsid antigen in 11 biopsies from 8 patients; 14 biopsies from 5 patients were negative for PUUV nucleocapsid antigen. IHC localized PUUV nucleocapsid antigen in endothelial cells of capillaries or larger vessels in the lamina propria. Rate of AKI was not higher and severity of AKI was not different in the PUUV-positive compared to the PUUV-negative group. All IHC positive biopsies were positive for PUUV RNA using RT-PCR. Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed clustering of all PUUV strains from this study with viruses previously detected from the South-West of Germany. Long-term outcome was favorable in both groups. Conclusions In patients with NE, PUUV nucleocapsid antigen and PUUV RNA was detected frequently in the intestine. This finding could explain frequent GI-symptoms in NE patients, thus demonstration of a more generalized PUUV infection. The RT-PCR was an effective and sensitive method to detect PUUV RNA in FFPE tissues. Therefore, it can be used as a diagnostic and phylogenetic approach also for archival materials. AKI was not more often present in patients with PUUV-positive IHC. This last finding should be investigated in larger numbers of patients with PUUV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2014962191,"BLM is a DNA helicase important for the restart of stalled replication forks and for homologous recombination (HR) repair. Mutations of BLM lead to Bloom Syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by elevated levels of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), dwarfism, immunodeficiency, infertility and increased cancer predisposition. BLM physically interacts with MUS81, an endonuclease involved in the restart of stalled replication forks and HR repair. Herein we report that loss of Mus81 in Blm hypomorph mutant mice leads to infertility, and growth and developmental defects that are not observed in single mutants. Double mutant cells and mice were hypersensitive to Mitomycin C and γ-irradiation (IR) compared with controls and their repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) mediated by HR pathway was significantly defective, whereas their non-homologous-end-joining repair was elevated compared with controls. We also demonstrate the importance of the loss of the nuclease activity of Mus81 in the defects observed in Mus81(-/-) and double mutant cells. Exacerbated IR-induced chromosomal aberration was observed in double mutant mice and despite their reduced SCE levels, these mutants showed increased tumorigenesis risks. Our data highlight the importance of Mus81 and Blm in DNA DSB repair pathways, fertility, development and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2046662805,"To promote the efficient and safe application of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors as a gene transfer tool in the central nervous system (CNS), transduction efficiency and clearance were studied for serotypes commonly used to transfect distinct areas of the brain. As AAV2 was shown to transduce only small volumes in several brain regions, this study compares the transduction efficiency of three AAV pseudotyped vectors, namely AAV2/1, AAV2/5 and AAV2/8, in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH). No difference was found between AAV2/1 and AAV2/5 in transduction efficiency. Both AAV2/1 and AAV2/5 achieved a higher transduction rate than AAV2/8. One hour after virus administration to the brain, no viral particles could be traced in blood, indicating that no or negligible numbers of virions crossed the blood-brain barrier. In order to investigate survival of AAV in blood, clearance was determined following systemic AAV administration. The half-life of AAV2/1, AAV2/2, AAV2/5 and AAV2/8 was calculated by determining virus clearance rates from blood after systemic injection. The half-life of AAV2/2 was 4.2 minutes, which was significantly lower than the half-lives of AAV2/1, AAV2/5 and AAV2/8. With a half-life of more than 11 hours, AAV2/8 particles remained detectable in blood significantly longer than AAV2/5. We conclude that application of AAV in the CNS is relatively safe as no AAV particles are detectable in blood after injection into the brain. With a half-life of 1.67 hours of AAV2/5, a systemic injection with 1×109 genomic copies of AAV would be fully cleared from blood after 2 days."
https://openalex.org/W1966777193,"PDZGEF is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small G protein Rap. It was recently found that PDZGEF contributes to establishment of intestinal epithelial polarity downstream of the kinase Lkb1. By binding to phosphatidic acid enriched at the apical membrane, PDZGEF locally activates Rap2a resulting in induction of brush border formation via a pathway that includes the polarity players TNIK, Mst4 and Ezrin. Here we show that the PDZ domain of PDZGEF is essential and sufficient for targeting PDZGEF to the apical membrane of polarized intestinal epithelial cells. Inhibition of PLD and consequently production of phosphatidic acid inhibitis targeting of PDZGEF to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, localization requires specific positively charged residues within the PDZ domain. We conclude that local accumulation of PDZGEF at the apical membrane during establishment of epithelial polarity is mediated by electrostatic interactions between positively charged side chains in the PDZ domain and negatively charged phosphatidic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1993816171,"Cdc kinase subunit (Cks) proteins Cks1 and Cks2 are adaptor-like proteins that bind many cyclin-dependent kinases. A wealth of clinical data has shown that Cks proteins are overexpressed in many types of human cancers and this often correlates with increased tumor aggressiveness. Previously, we showed that Cks overexpression abrogates the intra-S-phase checkpoint, a major barrier to oncogene-mediated transformation. Interestingly, the intra-S-phase checkpoint is crucial for the cellular response to replication stress, a major pathway of apoptosis induction by many chemotherapeutic agents. Here, we demonstrate cancer cells that overexpress Cks1 or Cks2 override the intra-S-phase checkpoint in the presence of replication stress-inducing chemotherapies such as 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and methotrexate (MTX) leading to enhanced sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, enforced expression of Cks1 in an MTX-resistant breast cancer cell line was found to restore drug sensitivity. Our results suggest that Cks proteins are important determinants of apoptosis induction of replication stress-inducing chemotherapies such as 5-FU."
https://openalex.org/W2037044994,"Introduction The efficacy of treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) can differ depending on the patient's serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) genotype, and the effects of varying plasma concentrations of drugs can also vary. We investigated the association between the paroxetine plasma concentration and clinical response in patients with different 5-HTTLPR genotypes. Methods Fifty-one patients were enrolled in this study. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was used to evaluate patients at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks. The patients' paroxetine plasma concentrations at week 6 were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Additionally, their 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms (alleles S and L) were analyzed using a polymerase chain reaction with specific primers. We divided the participants into two groups based on their L haplotype: the SS group and the SL and LL group. We performed single and multiple regression analyses to investigate the associations between MADRS improvement and paroxetine plasma concentrations or other covariates for each group. Results There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to demographic or clinical data. In the SS group, the paroxetine plasma concentration was significantly negatively correlated with improvement in MADRS at week 6. In the SL and LL group, the paroxetine plasma concentration was significantly positively correlated with improvement in MADRS at week 6 according to the results of the single regression analysis; however, it was not significantly correlated with improvement in MADRS at week 6 according to the results of the multiple regression analysis. Conclusion Among patients with MDD who do not respond to paroxetine, a lower plasma concentration or a lower oral dose of paroxetine might be more effective in those with the SS genotype, and a higher plasma concentration might be more effective in those with the SL or LL genotype."
https://openalex.org/W2051300892,"Chemokines are small secreted proteins functionally involved in the immune system's regulation of lymphocyte migration across numerous mammalian species. Given its growing popularity in immunological models, we investigated the structure and function of chemokine CXCL12 protein in tree shrews. We found that CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 in tree shrew had structural similarities to their homologous human proteins. Phylogenetic analysis supports the view that tree shrew is evolutionarily-close to the primates. Our results also showed that the human recombinant CXCL12 protein directly enhanced the migration of tree shrew's lymphocytes in vitro, while AMD3100 enhanced the mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) from bone marrow into peripheral blood in tree shrew in vivo. Collectively, these findings suggested that chemokines in tree shrews may play the same or similar roles as those in humans, and that the tree shrew is a viable animal model for studying human immunological diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2023794388,"Understanding the molecular mechanisms of oral carcinogenesis will yield important advances in diagnostics, prognostics, effective treatment, and outcome of oral cancer. Hence, in this study we have investigated the proteomic and peptidomic profiles by combining an orthotopic murine model of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), mass spectrometry-based proteomics and biological network analysis. Our results indicated the up-regulation of proteins involved in actin cytoskeleton organization and cell-cell junction assembly events and their expression was validated in human OSCC tissues. In addition, the functional relevance of talin-1 in OSCC adhesion, migration and invasion was demonstrated. Taken together, this study identified specific processes deregulated in oral cancer and provided novel refined OSCC-targeting molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1982019355,"Adenoidal tissue (also known as nasopharyngeal tonsils) of 58% of humans in the pediatric age group contains immature T-lymphoid cells with the phenotype of thymocytes (TdT+,CD1abc+, cytoplasmic CD3+, coexpressing CD4 and CD8, lacking an Intraepithelial Lymphocyte-associated phenotype). The notable difference in comparison to palatine tonsils is the clustering in groups and sheets, comprising hundreds or thousands of cells (1.7%±0.2 of total T cells). The thymic epithelium is morphologically and phenotypically absent. Adenoids share with tonsils and lymph nodes the presence of immature B cell precursors (TdT+, CD1a-, Pax5+, Surrogate light chain±), however in these latter the presence of TdT+, CD1a+, Pax5- precursors is absent or limited to individual cells. Human adenoids are distinct among the Waldeyer's ring lymphoid tissue because of the known embryogenic derivation from the third pharyngeal pouch, from which the thymus develops; in addition, they may display phenotypic incomplete features of a vestigial thymus."
https://openalex.org/W2035410291,"Diversin was recently reported to play roles in Wnt and JNK pathways. However, the expression pattern and biological roles of diversin in human breast cancer have not been reported. In the present study, we found that diversin was overexpressed in breast cancer specimens by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Significant association was observed between diversin overexpression and TNM stage (p = 0.0036), nodal metastasis (p = 0.0033), negative estrogen receptor expression (p = 0.0012) and triple-negative status (p = 0.0017). Furthermore, colony formation assay and matrigel invasion assay showed that knockdown of diversin expression in MDA-MB-231 cell line with high endogenous expression decreased cell proliferation and cell invasion. Transfection of diversin plasmid in MCF-7 cell line increased cell proliferation and invasion. Further analysis showed that diversin depletion downregulated JNK phosphorylation while its overexpression upregulated JNK phosphorylation. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that diversin was overexpressed in human breast cancers. Diversin could contribute to breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion."
