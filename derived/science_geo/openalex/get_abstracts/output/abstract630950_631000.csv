Retreating and thinning glaciers are icons of climate change3 and affect regional runoff4 as well as global sea level5,6. In past reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, estimates of changes in glacier mass were based on the multiplication of averaged or interpolated results from available observations of a few hundred glaciers by defined regional glacier areas7-10. For data-scarce regions, these results had to be complemented with estimates based on satellite altimetry and gravimetry11. These past approaches were challenged by the small number and heterogeneous spatiotemporal distribution of in situ measurement series and their often unknown ability to represent their respective mountain ranges, as well as by the spatial limitations of satellite altimetry (for which only point data are available) and gravimetry (with its coarse resolution). Here we use an extrapolation of glaciological and geodetic observations to show that glaciers contributed 27 ± 22 millimetres to global mean sea-level rise from 1961 to 2016. Regional specific-mass-change rates for 2006-2016 range from -0.1 metres to -1.2 metres of water equivalent per year, resulting in a global sea-level contribution of 335 ± 144 gigatonnes, or 0.92 ± 0.39 millimetres, per year. Although statistical uncertainty ranges overlap, our conclusions suggest that glacier mass loss may be larger than previously reported11. The present glacier mass loss is equivalent to the sea-level contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet12, clearly exceeds the loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet13, and accounts for 25 to 30 per cent of the total observed sea-level rise14. Present mass-loss rates indicate that glaciers could almost disappear in some mountain ranges in this century, while heavily glacierized regions will continue to contribute to sea-level rise beyond 2100."
https://openalex.org/W2929538902,"It is well established that ferroptosis is primarily controlled by glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Surprisingly, we observed that p53 activation modulates ferroptotic responses without apparent effects on GPX4 function. Instead, ALOX12 inactivation diminishes p53-mediated ferroptosis induced by reactive oxygen species stress and abrogates p53-dependent inhibition of tumour growth in xenograft models, suggesting that ALOX12 is critical for p53-mediated ferroptosis. The ALOX12 gene resides on human chromosome 17p13.1, a hotspot of monoallelic deletion in human cancers. Loss of one Alox12 allele is sufficient to accelerate tumorigenesis in Eμ-Myc lymphoma models. Moreover, ALOX12 missense mutations from human cancers abrogate its ability to oxygenate polyunsaturated fatty acids and to induce p53-mediated ferroptosis. Notably, ALOX12 is dispensable for ferroptosis induced by erastin or GPX4 inhibitors; conversely, ACSL4 is required for ferroptosis upon GPX4 inhibition but dispensable for p53-mediated ferroptosis. Thus, our study identifies an ALOX12-mediated, ACSL4-independent ferroptosis pathway that is critical for p53-dependent tumour suppression."

https://openalex.org/W2929173597,"Here we delineate the ontogeny of the mammalian endoderm by generating 112,217 single-cell transcriptomes, which represent all endoderm populations within the mouse embryo until midgestation. We use graph-based approaches to model differentiating cells, which provides a spatio-temporal characterization of developmental trajectories and defines the transcriptional architecture that accompanies the emergence of the first (primitive or extra-embryonic) endodermal population and its sister pluripotent (embryonic) epiblast lineage. We uncover a relationship between descendants of these two lineages, in which epiblast cells differentiate into endoderm at two distinct time points-before and during gastrulation. Trajectories of endoderm cells were mapped as they acquired embryonic versus extra-embryonic fates and as they spatially converged within the nascent gut endoderm, which revealed these cells to be globally similar but retain aspects of their lineage history. We observed the regionalized identity of cells along the anterior-posterior axis of the emergent gut tube, which reflects their embryonic or extra-embryonic origin, and the coordinated patterning of these cells into organ-specific territories."
https://openalex.org/W2936259264,"RNA aptamers and RNA aptamer-based devices can be genetically encoded and expressed in cells to probe and manipulate cellular function. However, their usefulness in the mammalian cell is limited by low expression and rapid degradation. Here we describe the Tornado (Twister-optimized RNA for durable overexpression) expression system for achieving rapid RNA circularization, resulting in RNA aptamers with high stability and expression levels. Tornado-expressed transcripts contain an RNA of interest flanked by Twister ribozymes. The ribozymes rapidly undergo autocatalytic cleavage, leaving termini that are ligated by the ubiquitous endogenous RNA ligase RtcB. Using this approach, protein-binding aptamers that otherwise have minimal effects in cells become potent inhibitors of cellular signaling. Additionally, an RNA-based fluorescent metabolite biosensor for S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) that is expressed at low levels when expressed as a linear RNA achieves levels sufficient for detection of intracellular SAM dynamics when expressed as a circular RNA. The Tornado expression system thus markedly enhances the utility of RNA-based approaches in the mammalian cell."
https://openalex.org/W2936229315,"Background and purpose We designed an 8-week caregiver-mediated exercise program with e-health support after stroke (CARE4STROKE) in addition to usual care with the aim to improve functional outcome and to facilitate early supported discharge by increasing the intensity of task specific training. Methods An observer-blinded randomized controlled trial in which 66 stroke patient-caregiver couples were included during inpatient rehabilitation. Patients allocated to the CARE4STROKE program trained an additional amount of 150 minutes a week with a caregiver and were compared to a control group that received usual care alone. Primary outcomes: self-reported mobility domain of the Stroke Impact Scale 3.0 (SIS) and length of stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes: motor impairment, strength, walking ability, balance, mobility and (Extended) Activities of Daily Living of patients, caregiver strain of caregivers, and mood, self-efficacy, fatigue and quality of life of both patients and caregivers. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 8 and 12 weeks after randomization. Results No significant between-group differences were found regarding SIS-mobility after 8 (β 6.21, SD 5.16; P = 0.229) and 12 weeks (β 0.14, SD 2.87; P = 0.961), and LOS (P = 0.818). Significant effects in favor of the intervention group were found for patient’s anxiety (β 2.01, SD 0.88; P = 0.023) and caregiver’s depression (β 2.33, SD 0.77; P = 0.003) post intervention. Decreased anxiety in patients remained significant at the 12-week follow-up (β 1.01, SD 0.40; P = 0.009). Conclusions This proof-of concept trial did not find significant effects on both primary outcomes mobility and LOS as well as the secondary functional outcomes. Treatment contrast in terms of total exercise time may have been insufficient to achieve these effects. However, caregiver-mediated exercises showed a favorable impact on secondary outcome measures of mood for both patient and caregiver.

https://openalex.org/W2952567086,"Inverted formin 2 (INF2) is a member of the formin family of actin assembly factors. Dominant missense mutations in INF2 are linked to two diseases: focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, a kidney disease, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a neuropathy. All of the disease mutations map to the autoinhibitory diaphanous inhibitory domain. Interestingly, purified INF2 is not autoinhibited, suggesting the existence of other cellular inhibitors. Here, we purified an INF2 inhibitor from mouse brain tissue, and identified it as a complex of lysine-acetylated actin (KAc-actin) and cyclase-associated protein (CAP). Inhibition of INF2 by CAP-KAc-actin is dependent on the INF2 diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID). Treatment of CAP-KAc-actin-inhibited INF2 with histone deacetylase 6 releases INF2 inhibition, whereas inhibitors of histone deacetylase 6 block the activation of cellular INF2. Disease-associated INF2 mutants are poorly inhibited by CAP-KAc-actin, suggesting that focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease result from reduced CAP-KAc-actin binding. These findings reveal a role for KAc-actin in the regulation of an actin assembly factor by a mechanism that we call facilitated autoinhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2938680857,"Introduction Understanding context and how this can be systematically assessed and incorporated is crucial to successful implementation. We describe how context has been assessed (including exploration or evaluation) in Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD) implementation research projects focused on improving health in people with or at risk of chronic disease and how contextual lessons were incorporated into the intervention or the implementation process. Methods Using a web-based semi-structured questionnaire, we conducted a cross-sectional survey to collect quantitative and qualitative data across GACD projects (n = 20) focusing on hypertension, diabetes and lung diseases. The use of context-specific data from project planning to evaluation was analyzed using mixed methods and a multi-layered context framework across five levels; 1) individual and family, 2) community, 3) healthcare setting, 4) local or district level, and 5) state or national level. Results Project teams used both qualitative and mixed methods to assess multiple levels of context (avg. = 4). Methodological approaches to assess context were identified as formal and informal assessments, engagement of stakeholders, use of locally adapted resources and materials, and use of diverse data sources. Contextual lessons were incorporated directly into the intervention by informing or adapting the intervention, improving intervention participation or improving communication with participants/stakeholders. Provision of services, equipment or information, continuous engagement with stakeholders, feedback for personnel to address gaps, and promoting institutionalization were themes identified to describe how contextual lessons are incorporated into the implementation process. Conclusions Context is regarded as critical and influenced the design and implementation of the GACD funded chronic disease interventions. There are different approaches to assess and incorporate context as demonstrated by this study and further research is required to systematically evaluate contextual approaches in terms of how they contribute to effectiveness or implementation outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2936750492,"Introduction Adipose tissue is considered an important metabolic tissue, in charge of energy storage as well as being able to act in systemic homeostasis and inflammation. Epigenetics involves a series of factors that are important for gene regulation or for chromatin structure, mostly DNA methylation and histone-tail modifications, which can be modified by environmental conditions (nutrition, lifestyle, smoking…). Since metabolic diseases like obesity and diabetes are closely related to lifestyle and nutrition, epigenetic deregulation could play an important role in the onset of these diseases and vice versa. However, little is known about histone marks in human adipose tissue. In a previous work, we developed a protocol for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of frozen human adipose tissue. By using this method, this study investigates, for the first time, the H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) mark (open chromatin) on the promoter of several factors involved in adipogenesis, lipid metabolism and inflammation in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from human subjects with different degrees of body mass index (BMI) and metabolic disease. Methodology VAT was collected and frozen at -80°C. 100 mg VAT samples were fixed in 0.5% formaldehyde and homogenized. After sonication, the sheared chromatin was immune-precipitated with an anti-H3K4me3 antibody linked to magnetic beads and purified. H3K4me3 enrichment was analyzed by qPCR for LEP, LPL, SREBF2, SCD1, PPARG, IL6, TNF and E2F1 promoters. mRNA extraction on the same samples was performed to quantify gene expression of these genes. Results H3K4me3 was enriched at the promoter of E2F1, LPL, SREBF2, SCD1, PPARG and IL6 in lean normoglycemic compared to morbid obese subjects with prediabetes. Accordingly H3K4me3 mark enrichment at E2F1, LPL, SREBF2, SCD1, PPARG and IL6 promoters was positively correlated with the BMI and the HOMA-IR. Regression analysis showed a strong relationship between the BMI with H3K4me3 at the promoter of E2F1 and LPL, and with mRNA levels of LEP and SCD. In the case of HOMA-IR, the regression analysis showed associations with H3K4me3 enrichment at the promoter of SCD1 and IL6, and with the mRNA of LEP and SCD1. Moreover H3K4me3 at the E2F1 promoter was positively associated to E2F1 mRNA levels. Conclusions H3K4me3 enrichment in the promoter of LEP, LPL, SREBF2, SCD1, PPARG, IL6, TNF and E2F1 is directly associated with increasing BMI and metabolic deterioration. The H3k4me3 mark could be regulating E3F1 mRNA levels in adipose tissue, while no associations between the promoter enrichment of this mark and mRNA levels existed for the other genes studied."

Chemical analysis by NMR and GPC showed that copolyesters were formed with decreasing molecular weight as p-coumaric acid content was increased. Physical characteristics, such as thermal and mechanical properties, as well as water uptake and water permeability, depended on the mole fraction of p-coumaric acid. The p-coumarate repetitive units increased the antioxidant capacity of the copolymers, showing antibacterial activity against the common pathogen Escherichia coli. In addition, all the synthesized copolyesters, except the one with the highest concentration of the phenolic acid, were cytocompatible and hemocompatible, thus becoming potentially useful for skin regeneration applications."
https://openalex.org/W2936827664,"Histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) and HDAC9 are class IIa HDACs that function as signal-responsive repressors of the epigenetic program for pathological cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. The conserved deacetylase domains of HDAC5 and HDAC9 are not required for inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, the biological function of class IIa HDAC catalytic activity in the heart remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that catalytic activity of HDAC5, but not HDAC9, suppresses mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation and subsequent induction of NF-E2–related factor 2 (NRF2)–dependent antioxidant gene expression in cardiomyocytes. Treatment of cardiomyocytes with TMP195 or TMP269, which are selective class IIa HDAC inhibitors, or shRNA-mediated knockdown of HDAC5 but not HDAC9 leads to stimulation of NRF2-mediated transcription in a reactive oxygen species–dependent manner. Conversely, ectopic expression of catalytically active HDAC5 decreases cardiomyocyte oxidative stress and represses NRF2 activation. These findings establish a role of the catalytic domain of HDAC5 in the control of cardiomyocyte redox homeostasis and define TMP195 and TMP269 as a novel class of NRF2 activators that function by suppressing the enzymatic activity of an epigenetic regulator."
https://openalex.org/W2940369354,"To describe the epidemiology of EOS including blood culture utilisation, across a large and geographically diverse Australian health district.Sepsis in the first three days of life remains a leading cause of death and morbidity. In high-income countries, group B Streptococcus (GBS) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) have dominated as causes of EOS for five decades.An 11-year retrospective cohort study to determine the epidemiology of EOS. Incidence rates were calculated per 1000 live births. Logistic regression with linear temporal trend and covariates for potential effect modifiers were employed. Blood culture utilisation was determined by examining the rate of babies undergoing blood culture within 72 hours of birth.Among 93,584 live born babies, 65 had confirmed EOS (0.69/1000 live births); 22 term, 43 preterm. Across the 4 largest birth units, the proportion of babies having blood culture within 72 hours of birth varied from 1.9-5.1% for term and 21-35% for preterm babies. The annual change in the EOS rate was significant, OR 0.91 (95% CI, 0.84 to 0.99, p = 0.03). Group B Streptococcus was the most common cause of EOS in term neonates at 0.35/1000 live births (95% CI, 0.07-0.63) in 2006 and 0.1/1000 live births (95% CI, 0-0.2) in 2016. Escherichia coli was the most common cause in preterm babies at 3.4/1000 (95% CI, 0.11-6.76) in 2006 reducing significantly to 1.35/1000 live births (95% CI, -0.07-2.78) by 2016.Escherichia coli and GBS were the most common causes of EOS in preterm and term babies respectively. Rates of all cause term and preterm EOS declined significantly as did preterm sepsis due to E. coli. While rate of sepsis due to early-onset GBS declined, this did not reach significance. Given the high proportion of preterm babies undergoing blood culture, it is unlikely that any EOS events were missed."
https://openalex.org/W2930356124,"Obese patients are more likely to develop periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) after primary total joint arthroplasty. This study compared the clinical and microbiological characteristics of non-obese, obese and severely obese patients with early PJI, in order to ultimately optimize antibiotic prophylaxis and other prevention measures for this specific patient category.We retrospectively evaluated patients with early PJI of the hip and knee treated with debridement, antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR) between 2006 and 2016 in three Dutch hospitals. Only patients with primary arthroplasties indicated for osteoarthritis were included. Early PJI was defined as an infection that developed within 90 days after index surgery. Obesity was defined as a BMI ≥30kg/m2 and severe obesity as a BMI ≥35kg/m2.A total of 237 patients were analyzed, including 64 obese patients (27.0%) and 62 severely obese patients (26.2%). Compared with non-obese patients, obese patients had higher rates of polymicrobial infections (60.3% vs 33.3%, p<0.001) with more often involvement of Enterococcus species (27.0% vs 11.7%, p = 0.003). Moreover, severely obese patients had more Gram-negative infections, especially with Proteus species (12.9% vs 2.3%, p = 0.001). These results were only found in periprosthetic hip infections, comprising Gram-negative PJIs in 34.2% of severely obese patients compared with 24.7% in obese patients and 12.7% in non-obese patients (p = 0.018).Our results demonstrate that obese patients with early periprosthetic hip infections have higher rates of polymicrobial infections with enterococci and Gram-negative rods, which stresses the importance of improving preventive strategies in this specific patient category, by adjusting antibiotic prophylaxis regimens, improving disinfection strategies and optimizing postoperative wound care."
https://openalex.org/W2927429411,"Processing of pro-interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 is regulated by multiprotein complexes, known as inflammasomes. Inflammasome activation results in generation of bioactive IL-1β and IL-18, which can exert potent pro-inflammatory effects. Our aim was to develop a whole blood-based assay to study the inflammasome in vitro and that also can be used as an assay in clinical studies. We show whole blood is a suitable milieu to study inflammasome activation in primary human monocytes. We demonstrated that unprocessed human blood cells can be stimulated to activate the inflammasome by the addition of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) within a narrow timeframe following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) priming. Stimulation with LPS resulted in IL-1β release; however, addition of ATP is necessary for ""full-blown"" inflammasome stimulation resulting in high IL-1β and IL-18 release. Intracellular cytokine staining demonstrated monocytes are the major producers of IL-1β in human whole blood cultures, and this was associated with activation of caspase-1/4/5, as detected by a fluorescently labelled caspase-1/4/5 probe. By applying caspase inhibitors, we show that both the canonical inflammasome pathway (via caspase-1) as well as the non-canonical inflammasome pathway (via caspases-4 and 5) can be studied using this whole blood-based model."
https://openalex.org/W2935740047,"Introduction Behavioral Activation is a behavioral-based treatment that has been proposed as suitable for smoking cessation, as it simultaneously addresses reinforcement-related variables and also mood management. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of a cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation treatment with components of behavioral activation (SCBSCT-BA) with a standard cognitive-behavioral treatment (SCBSCT), and a wait-list control group (WL). Method The sample was comprised of 275 adults smokers (61.4% females, mean age = 45.36, SD = 10.96). After baseline assessment sessions, participants were randomized (ratio: 2.2.1.) to SCBSCT-BA, SCBSCT, or WL. Active groups received 8 weekly 1-hour face-to-face group sessions. Biochemically verified smoking abstinence and depressive symptoms were assessed at the end of treatment, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. Results Significant treatment effects in 7-dayspoint prevalence abstinence rates were found for both active groups at the end of treatment. Abstinence rates at 12-months follow-up were 30% for SCBSCT-BA, and 18% for SCBSCT. Using Multiple Imputation for missing data, regression analysis showed significantly greater ORs for the SCBSCT-BA condition (vs. SCBSCT) at the end of treatment and at 3-months follow-up. At 6-, and 12-months follow-ups, ORs for the SCBSCT-BA condition, although greater, did not reach statistical significance. Multilevel analysis showed that abstinence was related to reductions in depressive symptoms. Conclusions SCBSCT-BA obtained positive results at short and medium term. Participants who quit smoking experienced a significant reduction in depressive symptoms. Findings support the benefit of adding BA to a cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation treatment.

https://openalex.org/W2937058936,"To assess the prevalence of self-reported dental pain and its association with sociodemographic, clinical and behavioral/psychosocial indicators among 8- to 10-year-old Brazilian schoolchildren.A cross-sectional study was carried out with 1,589 eight- to ten-year-old children randomly selected from public schools of Florianopolis, Brazil. Self-reports of dental pain were collected through a single question as follows: ""In the last month, how many times have you had pain in your teeth?"" Caries experience was determined by the DMFT/dmft index and its clinical consequences by the PUFA/pufa index. Dental trauma, dental fluorosis and molar-incisor hypomineralization were assessed through the Andreasen, Dean and European Academy of Pediatric Dentistry classifications, respectively. Clinical signs of dental erosion were also observed. Sociodemographic indicators were obtained through a questionnaire answered by the children's caregivers. Information about behavioral/psychosocial indicators was collected through questions from the Brazilian version of the Child Perception Questionnaire 8-10 years (CPQ8-10). Descriptive analysis, chi-square test, and hierarchically adjusted Poisson regression models were performed.819 children (51.5%) reported episodes of dental pain in the last month prior to the study, whereas 55.6% (n = 509) were girls. The presence of dental pain was significantly associated with sex, trouble sleeping, difficulty eating, school absenteeism, difficulty with paying attention in class, difficulty doing homework, staying away from recreational activities, caries experience, PUFA/pufa index and ulceration (p<0.05).The prevalence of self-reported dental pain in 8- to 10- year-old Brazilian schoolchildren was high and was associated with sociodemographic, clinical and behavioral/psychosocial indicators."
https://openalex.org/W2927654184,"Auxin response factor (ARF) is a member of the plant-specific B3 DNA binding superfamily. Here, we report the results of a comprehensive analysis of ARF genes in allotetraploid Brassica napus (2n = 38, AACC). Sixty-seven ARF genes were identified in B. napus (BnARFs) and divided into four subfamilies (I–IV). Sixty-one BnARFs were distributed on all chromosomes except C02; the remaining were on Ann and Cnn. The full length of the BnARF proteins was highly conserved especially within each subfamily with all members sharing the N-terminal DNA binding domain (DBD) and the middle region (MR), and most contained the C-terminal dimerization domain (PBI). Twenty-one members had a glutamine-rich MR that may be an activator and the remaining were repressors. Accordingly, the intron patterns are highly conserved in each subfamily or clade, especially in DBD and PBI domains. Several members in subfamily III are potential targets for miR167. Many putative cis-elements involved in phytohormones, light signaling responses, and biotic and abiotic stress were identified in BnARF promoters, implying their possible roles. Most ARF proteins are likely to interact with auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAA) -related proteins, and members from different subfamilies generally shared many common interaction proteins. Whole genome-wide duplication (WGD) by hybridization between Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea and segmental duplication led to gene expansion. Gene loss following WGD is biased with the An-subgenome retaining more ancestral genes than the Cn-subgenome. BnARFs have wide expression profiles across vegetative and reproductive organs during different developmental stages. No obvious expression bias was observed between An- and Cn-subgenomes. Most synteny-pair genes had similar expression patterns, indicating their functional redundancy. BnARFs were sensitive to exogenous IAA and 6-BA treatments especially subfamily III. The present study provides insights into the distribution, phylogeny, and evolution of ARF gene family."

In cancer cells, the ROS H2O2 can be generated during ligand-induced receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation and can further enhance RTK autophosphorylation by inhibiting protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity (6Bae Y.S.

For the INFS pathway, FGFR-1 is pumped out from the ER and enters the cytosol before entering the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex, whereas for the INTERNET pathway, EGFR remains membrane-bound and is transferred from the ER membrane connecting to outer nuclear membrane, through nuclear pore complex and then into the inner nuclear membrane (13Lee H.H.

The exact mechanism by which the MRIN enters the nucleus from inner nuclear membrane is not yet clear. However, Sec61β in the inner nuclear membrane is required, and a membrane-associated vesicle is likely involved (16Wang Y.N. Wang H. Yamaguchi H. Lee H.J. Lee H.H. Hung M.C.

However, the biological function of c-MET is not limited to its canonical signaling role from plasma membrane. c-MET holoreceptor also translocates into the nucleus rapidly to initiate calcium signaling in liver cells upon HGF stimulation (37Gomes D.A.

Moreover, constitutively active cytosolic fragments of c-MET (MET-CTF) are present continuously in the nuclei of TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 and involved in transcription regulation (38Matteucci E. Bendinelli P. Desiderio M.A. Nuclear localization of active HGF receptor Met in aggressive MDA-MB231 breast carcinoma cells.Carcinogenesis. 2009; 30 (19357348): 937-94510.1093/carcin/bgp080Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that c-MET can translocate into nucleus to interact with and phosphorylates PARP1 in response to H2O2 stimulation, which contributes to PARP inhibitor resistance in TNBC (10Du Y. Yamaguchi H. Wei Y. Hsu J.L. Wang H.L. Hsu Y.H. Lin W.C. Yu W.H. Leonard P.G. Lee 4th, G.R. Chen M.K. Nakai K. Hsu M.C. Chen C.T.

Med. 2016; 22 (26779812): 194-20110.1038/nm.4032Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that upon H2O2 stimulation, c-MET holoreceptor utilizes INTERNET pathway to translocate into the nucleus via the COPI/Sec61β-mediated retrograde vesicle trafficking. The H2O2-induced nuclear transport of c-MET occurs independently from c-MET phosphorylation. Moreover, we also show that nuclear c-MET can interact with KU proteins, which binds DNA double-strand breaks in DNA repair. Our findings suggested the involvement of H2O2-induced nuclear c-MET in DNA damage repair. To investigate whether full-length c-MET holoreceptor can translocate into the nucleus in response to ROS, we treated several c-MET–expressing cell lines derived from human mammary gland (MCF10A and MCF12A) or breast cancers with 10 mm H2O2 followed by cellular fraction and Western blotting to detect c-MET. We observed an accumulation of full-length c-MET in the nucleus for all cell lines tested after H2O2 treatment, whereas differential response to H2O2 treatment was observed for the truncated form of c-MET (MET-CTF) (Fig. 1A). We then further stimulated MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells with increasing concentrations of H2O2 and found that nuclear c-MET holoreceptor accumulation ocurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Treatment of 1–10 mm H2O2 induced c-MET nuclear translocation. The concentration of H2O2 at 10 mm was used in our experimental setting to observe significant nuclear c-MET accumulation to study mechanisms of membrane receptor trafficking. This concentration has been shown to be sufficient to affect multiple physiology functions in mammalian cells including DNA damage (39Shimizu S. Ishii M. Yamamoto T. Momose K. Mechanism of nitric oxide production induced by H2O2 in cultured endothelial cells.Res. Commun. Mol. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1997; 95 (9144831): 227-239PubMed Google Scholar, 40Björkman U. Ekholm R. Hydrogen peroxide degradation and glutathione peroxidase activity in cultures of thyroid cells.Mol.

Time-course experiments indicated that a 30-min H2O2 stimulation is sufficient for c-MET nuclear accumulation in both MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells (Fig. 1C). ROS inducing agents, such as doxorubicin, IR, and sodium arsenite, can also induce accumulation of full-length nuclear c-MET in breast cancer cells (Fig. 1, D and E, and Fig. S1), suggesting that c-MET nuclear translocation phenomenon is not limited to direct H2O2 treatment. On the contrary, chemotherapeutic agents that do not stimulate ROS accumulation, such as cisplatin and paclitaxel, did not induce nuclear c-MET accumulation (Fig. S1). We also found that prolonged ligand treatment (100 ng/ml HGF for 1–6 h) stimulated full-length nuclear MET accumulation in both MDA-MB-231 (1 h) and BT549 cells (6 h) (Fig. S2). Quantitative Western blotting analysis showed that full-length nuclear c-MET increased by 2-fold in MDA-MB-231 cells and by up to 7-fold in BT-549 cells (Fig. S2). However, unlike ligand-stimulated nuclear EGFR accumulation, which takes only within 30 min (18Wang Y.N. Lee H.H. Lee H.J. Du Y. Yamaguchi H. Hung M.C. Membrane-bound trafficking regulates nuclear transport of integral epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB-2.J. Biol.

Together, c-MET can translocate into the nucleus efficiently in response to different stimuli, but the ligand-induced translocation seems to be slower than that of EGFR. To determine the number of cells that contained nuclear c-MET after HGF or H2O2 stimulation, we performed several experiments using MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells. Immunostaining of c-MET indicated that it mainly located in the cytosol under normal culture conditions (control). It also aggregated at the perinuclear and nuclear regions in response to either HGF or H2O2 stimulation. Quantitative confocal microscopy also showed increasing amounts of cells containing nuclear c-MET after H2O2 stimulation. Consistent with the results from Western blotting analysis, we observed an apparent increase in the number of c-MET–containing nuclei following H2O2 treatment but only subtle increases in those treated with HGF (Fig. 1F). These results indicated that prolonged and high-concentration ligand stimulation at 100 ng/ml can induce c-MET holoreceptor nuclear translocation, but the response is less efficient than cellular stress stimulation. As mentioned, oxidative stress elicits stronger nuclear translocation of c-MET than did ligand stimulation (Fig. 1, B and F, and Fig. S2); we further investigated the mechanisms of c-MET nuclear transport under H2O2 stimulation. Based on the detection of full-length c-MET, which contains the transmembrane domain, we speculated that c-MET nuclear trafficking may occur via the membrane-bound INTERNET retrograde trafficking mechanism utilized by EGFR. To validate our hypothesis, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with Golgi apparatus inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA) for 30 min to interrupt normal Golgi function prior to H2O2 treatment. BFA treatment decreased the accumulation of nuclear c-MET holoreceptor (Fig. 2A), suggesting that c-MET is transported to the Golgi apparatus before reaching the nucleus. Membrane-bound cargo transport requires microtubules; therefore, we investigated whether disrupting the microtubule assembly also affects c-MET nuclear transport. We found that H2O2-induced c-MET nuclear translocation is reduced in cells pretreated with microtubule-depolarizing agent nocodazole, as well as microtubule dynamicity-decreasing agent paclitaxel (Fig. 2, B and C). Because c-MET is primarily localized in the cytosol in breast cancer cells under normal culture condition, it may be challenging to determine whether the cytoskeleton is important for c-MET nuclear transport. To this end, we investigated the effects of microtubule inhibition in membrane c-MET transport to the cytosolic compartment in HeLa cells, in which the majority of c-MET is localized in the cell membrane under normal culture condition and is widely used t"

This study examines the association between maternal education as a widely used indicator of SES and outcome in newborns requiring surgical correction of congenital anomalies.Ambispective data analysis of newborns with esophageal atresia (EA), intestinal atresia (IA), congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), omphalocele (OC), gastroschisis (GS) undergoing surgery between 01/2008-11/2017 accessing the clinical databases Neodat and Viewpoint. Maternal education was determined according to the validated education classification CASMIN and stratified into ""low"" SES and ""high"" SES group. Endpoints were incidence of postoperative complications, length of mechanical ventilation, and readmission to NICU.Inclusion of 169 patients with EA (n = 32), IA (n = 24), CDH (n = 47), OC (n = 19), GS (n = 47). Women of low SES (n = 67, 40%) attended fewer prenatal screenings (total, 4.6 vs. 7.9, P<0.0001; EA, 3.7 vs. 7.1, P = 0.0002; IA, 3.5 vs. 9.4, P = 0.0006; OC, 2.5 vs. 8.8, P = 0.009; GS, 4.1 vs. 7.0, P = 0.002). Low SES was associated with higher incidence of patients born small for gestational age (37% vs. 20%, P = 0.019), with additional congenital malformations (37% vs. 15%, P = 0.001), being born in a peripheral center (7% vs. 0%, P = 0.008), and with higher incidence of 5´APGAR scores <7 (23% vs. 7%, P = 0.004). Moreover, low SES was associated with higher incidence of postoperative complications (total 70% vs. 32%, P<0.0001; EA, 60% vs. 23%, P = 0.04; IA, 67% vs. 11%, P = 0.008; CDH, 83% vs. 46%, P = 0.009; GS, 74% vs. 25%, P = 0.001), and higher readmission rate to NICU (IA, 33% vs. 0%, P = 0.043; GS, 32% vs. 4%, P = 0.007).Low maternal education is associated with a reduced uptake of prenatal screenings, adverse neonatal outcomes, and higher incidence of postoperative complications in newborns with congenital anomalies. Primary prevention and specific support should be provided prenatally for families with low SES to avoid adverse outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2938306096,"Hormonal assessment tools are important for determining the reproductive success of production animals. This study used non-invasive wool assessment to quantify changes in progesterone and cortisol levels in reproducing female merino sheep. Wool samples were collected from a group of n = 46 maiden merino ewes (22-25 months old), naturally joined under natural light conditions in southern New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Three shearing opportunities were conducted as part of standard on-farm management practices. The wool samples were collected at three different dates during 2017, January (prior to rams being put out with the mob and to provide a baseline level since previous shearing in May 2016), September (during very late stages of gestation-approximately 2 weeks prior to parturition) and December (ewes had given birth and ~2-month-old lambs were at foot). Analysis of cortisol and progesterone was conducted concurrently from the same sample of wool. The hormones in wool samples quantified using commercially available cortisol and progesterone enzyme-immunoassay kits. Wool cortisol concentrations increased significantly (p = 3.04E-14) from pre-joining in January (1.33±0.12 ng/g) to late gestation in September (3.59±0.12 ng/g). Concentration of wool cortisol post-lambing in December (3.27±0.14 ng/g) did not decline significantly (p = 0.124) after gestation however remained significantly higher (p = 3.82E-10) than pre-joining levels. Wool progesterone (PG) concentrations increased significantly (p = 1.83E-33) from pre-joining (0.04±0.005 ng/g) in January to late gestation in September (5.53±0.13 ng/g) with a significant (p = 5.44E-59) decline observed in December (0.05±0.003 ng/g) to post- pregnancy concentrations. No significant difference was shown between pre-joining and post lambing PG concentrations (p = 0.057). Our results showed that non-invasive assessment of hormones in Merino sheep wool reflected significant increase in both cortisol and progesterone guided by pregnancy."

However, high proportions of these men have never undertaken HIV testing. We assessed barriers to and facilitators of HIV testing among men who purchase sex in Indonesia, including the acceptability of HIV self-testing. A qualitative study was conducted during December 2016-January 2017 at fourteen sex-work venues and one voluntary HIV counselling and testing (VCT) clinic in Bali. Interviews were conducted with men who purchase sex exploring the men's views on HIV testing. Data were examined using thematic analysis. Twenty-nine men participated in the study. The themes that emerged regarding the barriers to HIV testing included fear of potential shame, embarrassment, and confidentiality breach in accessing HIV testing; fear of social exclusion if the test result was positive; self-treatment and prevention; the distance to a clinic; time constraints; and fear of an invasive testing method. Factors that were seen as facilitating a test were the convenience of time and place; the provision of speedy results; and privacy. Participants expressed interest in HIV self-testing and preferred it to clinic-based testing due to the privacy and confidentiality of the results. The findings support the introduction of an HIV self-testing strategy among this group to improve access to HIV testing."

All patients identified as presumptive MDR-TB (defined as i) previously treated TB patients which included recurrent TB, return after loss to follow up, treatment after failure and ii) new TB patients that were non-converters at three months of treatment or in close contact with a known MDR-TB patient) during October 2006 to June 2013 were eligible for phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST). Pre-diagnosis attrition (presumptive MDR-TB not undergoing culture and DST) and pre-treatment attrition (confirmed MDR-TB patients not initiated on treatment) was calculated. Diagnosis delay was the time interval from DST eligibility to DST result, treatment initiation delay was fom DST result to treatment initiation and total delay was from DST eligbility to treatment initiation. Factors associated with attrition and delay were identified using log binomial regression and linear regression, respectively.Of 78 564 presumptive MDR-TB patients, 2 470 (3.1%) underwent pre-diagnosis attrition. Of 9 283 MDR-TB patients, 3 361 (36.2%) underwent pre-treatment attrition. Median(IQR) diagnosis delay was 84 (64, 114) days; treatment initation delay was 23(6,68) days and total delay was 117(77,187) days. Long diagnosis delay was an independent predictor of pre-treatment attrition in a dose response relationship. While pre-treatment attrition was less likely among presumptive criterion 'previously treated' and with increasing time period, it was more likey among elderly and in east and west region. While the diagnosis delay increased with time period, treatment initiation delay and total delay reduced with time period. Short diagnosis delay was associated with west region, smear negative patients and presumptive criterion 'treatment after lost to follow up'. Short treatment initiation delay was associatied with east and west regions while long treatment initiation delay was associated with elderly and presumptive criterion 'recurrent TB'. Total delay predictors were similar to treatment initiation delay. In addition, short total delay was associated with presumptive criterion 'treatment after failure'.The diagnosis and treatment delay were long and the pre-treatment attrition was considerable high. Long diagnosis delay is likely to predict pre-treatment attrition."

Our group is developing quantitative imaging methods for the preclinical arm of a co-clinical trial studying immunotherapy and radiotherapy in a soft tissue sarcoma model. In line with treatment for patients enrolled in the clinical trial SU2C-SARC032, primary mouse sarcomas are imaged with multi-contrast micro-MRI (T1 weighted, T2 weighted, and T1 with contrast) before and after immune checkpoint inhibition and pre-operative radiation therapy. Similar to the patients, after surgery the mice will be screened for lung metastases with micro-CT using respiratory gating. A systems evaluation was undertaken to establish a quantitative baseline for both the MR and micro-CT systems against which others systems might be compared. We have constructed imaging protocols which provide clinically-relevant resolution and contrast in a genetically engineered mouse model of sarcoma. We have employed tools in 3D Slicer for semi-automated segmentation of both MR and micro-CT images to measure tumor volumes efficiently and reliably in a large number of animals. Assessment of tumor burden in the resulting images was precise, repeatable, and reproducible. Furthermore, we have implemented a publicly accessible platform for sharing imaging data collected during the study, as well as protocols, supporting information, and data analyses. In doing so, we aim to improve the clinical relevance of small animal imaging and begin establishing standards for preclinical imaging of tumors from the perspective of a co-clinical trial."
https://openalex.org/W2939507045,"We describe methods to improve the efficiency with which HIV-1 Envelope glycoprotein SOSIP trimer immunogens can be produced by transient transfection of ExpiCHO-S cells and then affinity purified using the trimer-specific human monoclonal antibody PGT145. The specificity of PGT145 for properly folded trimers allows for the facile, one-step, isolation of these immunogens in research laboratories. PGT145 columns are also valuable as a component of more complex purification processes in current Good Manufacturing Practice programs. However, we found that PGT145 purification was highly variable and markedly inefficient when used to process supernatants from transiently transfected ExpiCHO-S cells expressing the BG505 SOSIP.664 and other trimeric Env proteins. In contrast, no such problems arose when the same Env proteins derived from a stable CHO cell line were processed on the same PGT145 columns, or with transient transfection supernatants from 293F cells. An investigation of the ExpiCHO-S transfection system identified the presence of polyanions, including but perhaps not limited to dextran sulfate, in the Enhancer component of the transfection system. We hypothesized that these polyanions bound to the cationic PGT145 epitope on the trimers and impeded their ability to bind to the PGT145 affinity column. We found that replacing the Enhancer component with alternative culture medium supplements substantially increased the yield of PGT145-purifiable trimers, and we also confirmed that both dextran sulfate and the Enhancer component were indeed inhibitors of PGT145 binding to BG505 SOSIP.664 trimers in immunoassays. The presence of polyanions, including but not limited to nucleic acids, should be considered in other circumstances where PGT145 columns are less efficient than expected at purifying native-like trimers."

The results showed that a total of 127,939 Unigenes with average length of 1,190 bp were obtained by assembly, of which 46% were annotated in the Nr database. A total of 1,698 differentially expressed genes were screened by differential gene expression analysis, of which 920 genes showed up-regulated expression and 778 genes showed down-regulated expression. Both GO and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes were enriched in spliceosomes, ribosomes, bile secretion, ABC transport pathways, and cellular nitrogen compound synthesis. A further in-depth analysis obtained 8 genes that may be associated with low-temperature traits of F. chinensis. Five of them displayed up-regulated expression, including ATP-binding cassette protein C, acid ceramidase, glutathione transferase, C-type lectin and heat shock protein HSP70. The remaining three genes, γ-butyl betaine hydroxylase, β-hexosaminidase A and long chain fatty acid-CoA ligase displayed down-regulated expression. Eight differentially expressed genes were randomly selected and the real time RT-PCR verification showed that their expression levels were consistent with the sequencing results, demonstrating the accuracy of the sequencing results. The results of this study provide basic data for revealing the molecular mechanisms of F. chinensis in response to low temperature stress and the molecular assisted breeding of F. chinensis in low temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2936385354,"The complement-like pathway of the African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae provides protection against infection by diverse pathogens. A functional requirement for a core set of proteins during infections by rodent and human malaria parasites, bacteria, and fungi suggests a similar mechanism operates against different pathogens. However, the extent to which the molecular mechanisms are conserved is unknown. In this study we probed the biochemical responses of complement-like pathway to challenge by the Gram-positive bacterium Staphyloccocus aureus. Western blot analysis of the hemolymph revealed that S. aureus challenge activates a TEP1 convertase-like activity and promotes the depletion of the protein SPCLIP1. S. aureus challenge did not lead to an apparent change in the abundance of the LRIM1/APL1C complex compared to challenge by the Gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli. Following up on this observation using a panel of LRIM1 and APL1C antibodies, we found that E. coli challenge, but not S. aureus, specifically activates a protease that cleaves the C-terminus of APL1C. Inhibitor studies in vivo and in vitro protease assays suggest that a serine protease is responsible for APL1C cleavage. This study reveals that despite different challenges converging on activation of a TEP1 convertase-like activity, the mosquito complement-like pathway also includes pathogen-specific reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2950795148,"We observed that heat shock of Caenorhabditis elegans leads to the formation of nuclear double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) foci, detectable with a dsRNA-specific monoclonal antibody. These foci significantly overlap with nuclear HSF-1 granules. To investigate the molecular mechanism(s) underlying dsRNA foci formation, we used RNA-seq to globally characterize total RNA and immunoprecipitated dsRNA from control and heat shocked worms. We find a subset of both sense and antisense transcripts enriched in the dsRNA pool by heat shock overlap with dsRNA transcripts enriched by deletion of tdp-1, which encodes the C. elegans ortholog of TDP-43. Interestingly, transcripts involved in translation are over-represented in the dsRNAs induced by either heat shock or deletion of tdp-1. Also enriched in the dsRNA transcripts are sequences downstream of annotated genes (DoGs), which we globally quantified with a new algorithm. To validate these observations, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to confirm both antisense and downstream of gene transcription for eif-3.B, one of the affected loci we identified."

Study design A cross-sectional study of skilled health providers (doctors, nurses and midwives) working in the hospitals during the period. Setting Six general hospitals (4 in the south and 2 in the north), and two teaching hospitals (both in the Northern part) of the country. Population All skilled providers offering EMOC services in the hospitals during the study. Methods A pre-tested self-administered questionnaire was used to obtain information relating to socio-demographic characteristics, the respondents’ knowledge and skills in offering specific EMOC services (as compared to standard World Health Organization recommendations), and their confidence in transferring the skills to mid-level providers. Data were analyzed with univariate, bivariate, binary and multinomial logistic regression analyses. Main outcome measures: knowledge and skills in EMOC services by hospital and overall. Results A total of 341 health providers (148 doctors and 193 nurses/midwives) participated in the study. Averagely, the providers scored less than 46% in a composite EMOC knowledge score, with doctors scoring considerable higher than the nurses/midwives. Similarly, doctors scored higher than nurses/midwives in the self-reporting of confidence in carrying out specific EMOC functions. Health providers that scored higher in knowledge were significantly more likely to report confidence in performing specific EMOC functions as compared to those with lower scores. The self-reporting of confidence in transferring clinical skills was also higher in those with higher EMOC knowledge scores. Conclusion The knowledge and reported skills on EMOC by health providers in referral facilities in Nigeria was lower than average. We conclude that the in-service training and re-training of health providers should be included in national policy and programs that address maternal mortality prevention in referral facilities in the country.

https://openalex.org/W2937671923,"Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is the most important tick-transmitted pathogen. It belongs to the Flaviviridae family and causes severe human neuroinfections. In this study, protective efficacy of the chimeric antibody chFVN145 was examined in mice infected with strains belonging to the Far-Eastern, European, and Siberian subtypes of TBEV, and the antibody showed clear therapeutic efficacy when it was administered once one, two, or three days after infection. The efficacy was independent of the TBEV strain used to infect the mice; however, the survival rate of the mice was dependent on the dose of TBEV and of the antibody. No enhancement of TBEV infection was observed when the mice were treated with non-protective doses of chFVN145. Using a panel of recombinant fragments of the TBEV glycoprotein E, the neutralizing epitope for chFVN145 was localized in domain III of the TBEV glycoprotein E, in a region between amino acid residues 301 and 359. In addition, three potential sites responsible for binding with chFVN145 were determined using peptide phage display libraries, and 3D modeling demonstrated that the sites do not contact the fusion loop and, hence, their binding with chFVN145 does not result in increased attachment of TBEV to target cells."
https://openalex.org/W2938613452,"In homes, problems in daily functioning of older people often occur in the bathroom, especially in the transfers to the toilet and/or shower/bath. Assistive products have the potential to maximise functional independence (i.e. performance without assistance from another person) in everyday activities; however, more research is needed to better understand the impact of this technology on independence in the transfers in the bathroom. Additionally, little is known about the role of the environmental factors in the process of implementing bathroom adaptations. Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to examine the relationship between the use of assistive products and independence in the transfers in the bathroom. The secondary objective was to determine the role of the environmental factors in predicting the implementation of bathroom adaptations. 193 community-dwelling older adults with disabilities in the basic activities of daily life, who requested public long-term care services in Spain, were included. Data was collected in the participant´s homes using a standardised assessment procedure. There was no significant association between the number of categories of assistive products used in the toilet transfer and the independent performance of this task. In a multivariate model, the number of categories of assistive products used in the transfer to shower/bath was positively associated with the independent performance of this transfer (OR = 2.59, 95%CI = 1.48-4.53; p = 0.001). A multivariate analysis revealed that social functioning was significantly associated with the implementation of a bathroom adaptation; social risk was lower in participants who made an adaptation (OR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.63-0.93; p = 0.006). Assistive products may play an important role in promoting independence in the bathroom. Assistive product needs should be addressed when planning community-based interventions aimed at improving daily life. Moreover, social functioning had a strong influence on the installation of bathroom adaptations, suggesting the importance of paying special attention to social factors in the home adaptations planning process."
https://openalex.org/W2935835841,"Phosphodiesterase-6 (PDE6) plays a central role in both rod and cone phototransduction pathways. In the dark, PDE6 activity is suppressed by its inhibitory γ-subunit (Pγ). Rhodopsin-catalyzed activation of the G protein transducin relieves this inhibition and enhances PDE6 catalysis. We hypothesized that amino acid sequence differences between rod- and cone-specific Pγs underlie transducin's ability to more effectively activate cone-specific PDE6 than rod PDE6. To test this, we analyzed rod and cone Pγ sequences from all major vertebrate and cyclostome lineages and found that rod Pγ loci are far more conserved than cone Pγ sequences and that most of the sequence differences are located in the N-terminal region. Next we reconstituted rod PDE6 catalytic dimer (Pαβ) with various rod or cone Pγ variants and analyzed PDE6 activation upon addition of the activated transducin α-subunit (Gtα*-GTPγS). This analysis revealed a rod-specific Pγ motif (amino acids 9-18) that reduces the ability of Gtα*-GTPγS to activate the reconstituted PDE6. In cone Pγ, Asn-13 and Gln-14 significantly enhanced Gtα*-GTPγS activation of cone Pγ truncation variants. Moreover, we observed that the first four amino acids of either rod or cone Pγ contribute to Gtα*-GTPγS-mediated activation of PDE6. We conclude that physiological differences between rod and cone photoreceptor light responsiveness can be partially ascribed to ancient, highly conserved amino acid differences in the N-terminal regions of Pγ isoforms, demonstrating for the first time a functional role for this region of Pγ in the differential activation of rod and cone PDE6 by transducin."
https://openalex.org/W2938321294,"Anatomy of the muscle-tendon system is an important component to musculoskeletal models. In particular, the cross-sectional area of belly (mCSA) and tendon (tCSA) provides information about the maximum force that a muscle may exert. The ratio of mCSA to tCSA (rCSA) demonstrates how muscle force is related to the ability to resist/transmit the force to bone. Previous anatomical studies of the lumbar paraspinal muscles (LPM) showed that their bellies have large mCSA suggesting that they are powerful muscles. Surprisingly, surgical experience shows that the tendons of the LPM are among the thinnest tendons of the body. We therefore hypothesized that traditional biomechanics of the LPM and the rCSA do not correspond for LPM. In 10 fresh-frozen old cadavers, we measured the mCSA, tCSA and rCSA of the LPM (multifidus and the erector spinae, i.e. the longissimus and the iliocostalis); then, we compared these data with those of one of the weakest muscles in the body, i.e. the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) chosen because it shares some common anatomical features with the LPM, in particular with the erector spinae. For instance, the EDC has a polyarticular course and presents long and thin effector tendons. Among the LPM, the longissimus has the greatest mean ACSA with 10.42 cm2 compared with 9.16 cm2 for the iliocostalis and 0.24 cm2 for the multifidus. Mean ACSA of the EDC was almost ten times smaller than those of erector spinae. Regarding the mean tCSA, the EDC was the largest one with 11.48 mm2 compared with 2.69 mm2 and 1.43 mm2 for the longissimus, 5.74 mm2 and 2.38 mm2for the iliocostalis and 5.28 mm2 and 4.96 mm2 for the multifidus. Mean rCSAs of the erector spinae were extremely small, ranged from 1/156 for the spinal attachment of the iliocostalis to 1/739 for the rib attachment of the longissimus that suggests that tendons are an unsuitable size to transmit the force to bone. Mean rCSA of the multifidus and the EDC were in the same range with rCSA = 1/5 and rCSA = 1/9 respectively. The rCSA of the multifidus was substantial, but its ACSA (1cm2) corresponds to low-power muscles. This paradoxical anatomy compels us to consider the biomechanics of the LPM in a different way from that of the classical ""chord-like model"", i.e. the muscle belly creates a force that is applied to a bone piece through a tendon. The LPM have large contractile mass in a semi-rigid compartment inside which the pressure may increase. This result strengthens the hypothesis that high pressure and intrinsic stiffness of the LPM create two stiff bodies, closely attached to the spine thus ensuring its stabilization."

A diagnostic strategy that clarifies these uncertainties could enable personalized asthma treatment and mitigate antibiotic overuse.To explore the performance of validated peripheral blood gene expression signatures in discriminating bacterial, viral, and noninfectious triggers in subjects with asthma exacerbations.Subjects with suspected asthma exacerbations of various etiologies were retrospectively selected for peripheral blood gene expression analysis from a pool of subjects previously enrolled in emergency departments with acute respiratory illness. RT-PCR quantified 87 gene targets, selected from microarray-based studies, followed by logistic regression modeling to define bacterial, viral, or noninfectious class. The model-predicted class was compared to clinical adjudication and procalcitonin.Of 46 subjects enrolled, 7 were clinically adjudicated as bacterial, 18 as viral, and 21 as noninfectious. Model prediction was congruent with clinical adjudication in 15/18 viral and 13/21 noninfectious cases, but only 1/7 bacterial cases. None of the adjudicated bacterial cases had confirmatory microbiology; the precise etiology in this group was uncertain. Procalcitonin classified only one subject in the cohort as bacterial. 47.8% of subjects received antibiotics.Our model classified asthma exacerbations by the underlying bacterial, viral, and noninfectious host response. Compared to clinical adjudication, the majority of discordances occurred in the bacterial group, due to either imperfect adjudication or model misclassification. Bacterial infection was identified infrequently by all classification schemes, but nearly half of subjects were prescribed antibiotics. A gene expression-based approach may offer useful diagnostic information in this population and guide appropriate antibiotic use."
https://openalex.org/W2937746753,"The control of mammalian pests relies heavily on the use of pesticides that are often avoided and are not species-specific. These problems are particularly acute for pesticides used to control rats (Rattus spp.). The efficacy and targeting of control could be improved by attracting animals to control measures using species-specific cues. One cue that has the potential to attract rats is the 50 kHz calls they emit in positive social situations. Here we test the potential of these rat calls as a species-specific attractant by examining the response of laboratory rats (Rattus norvegicus; n = 48) and non-target bank voles (Myodes glareolus; n = 16) to 50 kHz calls from either sex in a compartmentalised laboratory arena. Sounds of rat movement and white noise acted as control treatments, with each sound tested against a silent control in the opposite side of the arena. When sound cues were played above an empty bait box, rats were attracted to spend time close to 50 kHz rat calls, climbing on top of boxes, regardless of the sex of subject or caller. When either 50 kHz rat calls or rat movement sounds were played inside an empty bait box, rats of both sexes spent 3–4 fold more time inside boxes and visited more frequently. Rats were not attracted by intermittent white noise. Bank voles were neither attracted to, nor avoided, 50 kHz rat calls played inside empty bait boxes. Our findings show that 50 kHz rat calls are an effective attractant for rats of both sexes under laboratory conditions, while not attracting non-target bank voles. These calls are strong candidates for providing a species-specific lure that may be attractive even in the absence of food bait, but further trials will be needed to assess their efficacy under field conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2938345686,"Phosphatidylcholine (PPC) formula has been therapeutically used to reduce areas of localized fat. However, no single research has been carried out on its effect on a variety of cells in adipose and muscle tissues. Herein, the current study aimed to explore the activity of PPC on different cells in adipose and muscle tissues and to investigate the molecular mechanisms contributing to the effects of PPC on lipolysis and apoptosis. mRNA expression levels of various genes were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Protein expression levels were observed through Western blotting and cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Lipolysis and caspase 3 activity assay were performed using commercial kits. PPC induces lipolysis and apoptosis in adipocytes (3T3-L1), but not in the other tested cells, including skeletal muscle cells (C2C12 myocytes), endothelial cells (HUVEC), and fibroblasts (BJ). The possible role of TNFα and IL-1β-mediated pathways on the effects of PPC was also revealed. We confirmed that treatment with PPC caused lipolysis and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (only in 3T3-L1 adipocytes). The effect of PPC observed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was not evident in C2C12 myocytes, HUVEC, and fibroblasts. PPC also increased TNFα and IL-1β expression and release in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in a dose-dependent fashion, but not in C2C12 myocytes, HUVEC, and BJ. Suppression of TNFα or IL-1β reversed PPC-induced lipolysis and apoptosis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, suggesting that PPC could promote adipocyte-specific lipolysis and apoptosis through TNFα and IL-1β-mediated signaling. We conclude that the specific activity of PPC on adipocyte in adipose without other tissue damages can be an effective approach for melting lipid."

To this end, larval tissues were exposed to NRB probes alone or in combination with other commercial dyes or GFP-tagged protein markers. Both probes were rapidly internalized by most tissues (except the central nervous system) allowing each organ in the microscope field to be readily distinguished at low magnification. At the cellular level, the probes showed a very similar distribution (except for fat bodies), defined by loss of signal in the nucleus and plasma membrane, and a preferential localization to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. They also recognized ER and mitochondrial phenotypes in the skeletal muscles of fruit fly models that had loss of function mutations in the atlastin and mitofusin genes, suggesting NRBMC009 and NRBZLW0047 as potentially useful screening tools for characterizing ER and mitochondria morphological alterations. Feeding of larvae and adult Drosophilae with the NRB-derived dyes led to staining of the gut and its epithelial cells, revealing a potential role in food intake assays. In addition, when flies were exposed to either dye over their entire life cycle no apparent functional or morphological abnormalities were detected. Rapid internalization, a bright signal, a compatibility with other available fluorescent probes and GFP-tagged protein markers, and a lack of toxicity make NRBZLW0047 and, particularly, NRBMC009 highly performing fluorescent probes for live cell microscopy studies and food intake assays in Drosophila."

We confirm they are both functional meso-diaminopimelate decarboxylases, although with lower activities than those previously reported for bacterial orthologs. We also report in-depth X-ray crystallographic structural analyses of each isoform at 1.9 and 2.4 Å resolution. We have captured the enzyme structure of one isoform in an asymmetric configuration, with one ligand-bound monomer and the other in an apo-form. Analytical ultracentrifugation and small-angle X-ray scattering solution studies reveal that A. thaliana meso-diaminopimelate decarboxylase adopts a homodimeric assembly. On the basis of our structural analyses, we suggest a mechanism whereby molecular interactions within the active site transduce conformational changes to the active-site loop. These conformational differences are likely to influence catalytic activity in a way that could allow for d-stereocenter selectivity of the substrate meso-diaminopimelate to facilitate the synthesis of l-lysine.

https://openalex.org/W2940106179,"Background Pharmacodynamic biomarkers are becoming increasingly valuable for assessing drug activity and target modulation in clinical trials. However, identifying quality biomarkers is challenging due to the increasing volume and heterogeneity of relevant data describing the biological networks that underlie disease mechanisms. A biological pathway network typically includes entities (e.g. genes, proteins and chemicals/drugs) as well as the relationships between these and is typically curated or mined from structured databases and textual co-occurrence data. We propose a hybrid Natural Language Processing and directed relationships-based network analysis approach using IBM Watson for Drug Discovery to rank all human genes and identify potential candidate biomarkers, requiring only an initial determination of a specific target-disease relationship. Methods Through natural language processing of scientific literature, Watson for Drug Discovery creates a network of semantic relationships between biological concepts such as genes, drugs, and diseases. Using Bruton’s tyrosine kinase as a case study, Watson for Drug Discovery’s automatically extracted relationship network was compared with a prominent manually curated physical interaction network. Additionally, potential biomarkers for Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibition were predicted using a matrix factorization approach and subsequently compared with expert-generated biomarkers. Results Watson’s natural language processing generated a relationship network matching 55 (86%) genes upstream of BTK and 98 (95%) genes downstream of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase in a prominent manually curated physical interaction network. Matrix factorization analysis predicted 11 of 13 genes identified by Merck subject matter experts in the top 20% of Watson for Drug Discovery’s 13,595 ranked genes, with 7 in the top 5%. Conclusion Taken together, these results suggest that Watson for Drug Discovery’s automatic relationship network identifies the majority of upstream and downstream genes in biological pathway networks and can be used to help with the identification and prioritization of pharmacodynamic biomarker evaluation, accelerating the early phases of disease hypothesis generation."

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, phosphatidylserine (PS) synthesized by PS synthase, Pss1, in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is decarboxylated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) by PS decarboxylase, Psd1, in the ER and mitochondria or by Psd2 in the endosome, Golgi, and/or vacuole, but the mechanism of interorganelle PS transport remains to be elucidated. Here we report that Sfh1, a member of Sec14 family proteins of S. cerevisiae, possesses the ability to enhance PE production by Psd2. Overexpression of SFH1 in the strain defective in Psd1 restored its growth on non-fermentable carbon sources and increased the intracellular and mitochondrial PE levels. Sfh1 was found to bind various phospholipids, including PS, in vivo. Bacterially expressed and purified Sfh1 was suggested to have the ability to transport fluorescently labeled PS between liposomes by fluorescence dequenching assay in vitro. Biochemical subcellular fractionation suggested that a fraction of Sfh1 localizes to the endosome, Golgi, and/or vacuole. We propose a model that Sfh1 promotes PE production by Psd2 by transferring phospholipids between the ER and endosome."
https://openalex.org/W2937216372,"The kidney is especially sensitive to diseases associated with overactivation of the complement system. While most of these diseases affect kidney glomeruli and the microvasculature, there is also evidence for tubulointerstitial deposition of complement factors. Complement inactivating factors on cell membranes comprise CD55, CD59 and CD46, which is also termed membrane cofactor protein (MCP). CD46 has been described as localized to glomeruli, but especially also to proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs). However, human cell culture models to assess CD46 function on RPTECs are still missing. Therefore, we here performed gene editing of RPTEC/TERT1 cells generating a monoclonal CD46-/- cell line that did not show changes of the primary cell like characteristics. In addition, factor I and CD46-mediated cleavage of C4b into soluble C4c and membrane deposited C4d was clearly reduced in the knock-out cell line as compared to the maternal cells. Thus, human CD46-/- proximal tubular epithelial cells will be of interest to dissect the roles of the epithelium and the kidney in various complement activation mediated tubulointerstitial pathologies or in studying CD46 mediated uropathogenic internalization of bacteria. In addition, this gives proof-of-principle, that telomerized cells can be used in the generation of knock-out, knock-in or any kind of reporter cell lines without losing the primary cell characteristics of the maternal cells."

Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies link variants with affected genes, helping to determine how these variants might regulate gene expression and may influence prostate cancer risk. In the current study, we performed eQTL analysis on 471 normal prostate epithelium samples and 249 PrCa-risk variants in 196 risk loci, utilizing RNA sequencing transcriptome data based on ENSEMBL gene definition and genome-wide variant data. We identified a total of 213 genes associated with known PrCa-risk variants, including 141 protein-coding genes, 16 lncRNAs, and 56 other non-coding RNA species with differential expression. Compared to our previous analysis, where RefSeq was used for gene annotation, we identified an additional 130 expressed genes associated with known PrCa-risk variants. We detected an eQTL signal for more than half (n = 102, 52%) of the 196 loci tested; 52 (51%) of which were a Group 1 signal, indicating high linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the peak eQTL variant and the PrCa-risk variant (r2>0.5) and may help explain how risk variants influence the development of prostate cancer."

Fairall and colleagues conducted a cluster-randomized trial to determine the effects/impact of STRETCH on patient health outcomes in South Africa between 2008 and 2010. The purpose of our replication study is to evaluate Fairall and colleagues' findings. We conducted push button and pure replication studies and measurement and estimation analyses (MEA). Our MEA validates the original findings: (1) overall, time to death did not differ between intervention (STRETCH) and control (ART) patients; (2) in a subgroup analysis of patients with CD4 counts of 201-350 cells per μL, the intervention group patients had a 30% lower risk of death than those in the control group, when controlling for baseline characteristics; (3) in a subgroup analysis of patients with CD4 counts of ≤200 cells per μL, time to death did not differ between the two groups; and (4) rates of viral suppression one year after enrollment did not differ between the intervention and control groups. This set of results have more caveats in the MEA. Although the intervention did not lead to improvements in the main outcomes, the effectiveness of STRETCH was proven to be similar to standard care while increasing the pool of prescribers, expanding their geographical range, and improving the quality of care for patients. Therefore, our analyses support the implementation of task shifting of antiretroviral therapy from doctors to trained nurses, which enhances confidence in the implementation of the intervention program and policymaking not only in South Africa but also in other developing countries that have similar circumstances."

The aim of this study was to use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to elucidate the morphological changes in PA vasculature after creation of a bidirectional cavopulmonary connection (BCPC) in children.This prospective study evaluated PA wall thickness and development of PA vasa vasorum (VV) in the distal PA of eight patients (BCPC group, 1.3 ± 0.3 years) and 20 age-matched children with normal pulmonary artery hemodynamics and morphology (Control group, 1.4 ± 0.3 years). VV development was defined by the VV area ratio, defined as the VV area divided by the adventitial area in cross-sectional images.There was no significant difference in PA wall thickness between the BCPC and control groups (0.12 ± 0.03 mm vs. 0.12 ± 0.02 mm, respectively). The VV area ratio was significantly greater in the BCPC group than in the Control group (14.5 ± 3.5% vs. 5.3 ± 1.6%, respectively; p<0.0001).OCT is a promising new tool for evaluating PA pathology, including the development of VV in patients after BCPC."
https://openalex.org/W2939081777,"Expression of hepcidin, the hormone regulating iron homeostasis, is increased by iron overload and decreased by accelerated erythropoiesis or iron deficiency. The purpose of the study was to examine the effect of these stimuli, either alone or in combination, on the main signaling pathway controlling hepcidin biosynthesis in the liver, and on the expression of splenic modulators of hepcidin biosynthesis. Liver phosphorylated SMAD 1 and 5 proteins were determined by immunoblotting in male mice treated with iron dextran, kept on an iron deficient diet, or administered recombinant erythropoietin for four consecutive days. Administration of iron increased liver phosphorylated SMAD protein content and hepcidin mRNA content; subsequent administration of erythropoietin significantly decreased both the iron-induced phosphorylated SMAD proteins and hepcidin mRNA. These results are in agreement with the recent observation that erythroferrone binds and inactivates the BMP6 protein. Administration of erythropoietin substantially increased the amount of erythroferrone and transferrin receptor 2 proteins in the spleen; pretreatment with iron did not influence the erythropoietin-induced content of these proteins. Erythropoietin-treated iron-deficient mice displayed smaller spleen size in comparison with erythropoietin-treated mice kept on a control diet. While the erythropoietin-induced increase in splenic erythroferrone protein content was not significantly affected by iron deficiency, the content of transferrin receptor 2 protein was lower in the spleens of erythropoietin-treated mice kept on iron-deficient diet, suggesting posttranscriptional regulation of transferrin receptor 2. Interestingly, iron deficiency and erythropoietin administration had additive effect on hepcidin gene downregulation in the liver. In mice subjected both to iron deficiency and erythropoietin administration, the decrease of hepcidin expression was much more pronounced than the decrease in phosphorylated SMAD protein content or the decrease in the expression of the SMAD target genes Id1 and Smad7. These results suggest the existence of another, SMAD-independent pathway of hepcidin gene downregulation."

Rapid degradation of ARE-containing mRNAs, referred to as ARE-mediated mRNA decay (AMD), is regulated by trans-acting ARE-binding proteins, which are either stabilizing factors (e.g. Hu antigen R (HuR)) or destabilizing factors (e.g. tristetraprolin, butyrate response factors (BRFs) 1 and 2 (also known as ZFP36 ring finger protein–like 1 and 2), KH-type splicing-regulatory protein (KSRP), and AU-rich element RNA-binding protein 1 (AUF1)). In this study, we provide molecular evidence that poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs are post-transcriptionally regulated via BRF1. Recent data suggest that under stressful conditions such as UVC irradiation and treatment with puromycin (Puro; a potent inhibitor of translation), poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs are stabilized by HuR in a translation-independent manner (23Ryu I.

To test the above hypothesis, we determined whether treatment with MG132, a potent inhibitor of the proteasome, can inhibit UVC-mediated up-regulation of poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs (Fig. 1A).

In contrast, the levels of total RDH mRNAs (poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs and HSL+ RDH mRNAs) and H3F3A mRNA, one of the RIH mRNAs, were only marginally affected by UVC irradiation. Notably, treatment with MG132 drastically inhibited the UVC-mediated up-regulation of all the tested poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs. Similarly, treatment with Puro up-regulated the poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs 10.1–125.3-fold. This up-regulation was almost completely reversed by MG132 treatment (Fig. 1B). In the 3′-UTR, the poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs harbor a novel cis-acting element called the PRSE, which is critical for stabilization of these mRNAs under various types of stress (23Ryu I. Park Y. Seo J.W. Park O.H. Ha H. Nam J.W. Kim Y.K. HuR stabilizes a polyadenylated form of replication-dependent histone mRNAs under stress conditions.FASEB J. 2019; 33 (30303743): 2680-269310.1096/fj.201800431RCrossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To test whether the effect of MG132 on the stability of poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs is related to the PRSE, a plasmid expressing HIST1H4K-MT10 reporter mRNA, which harbors the minimal PRSE of the HIST1H4K gene in the 3′-UTR, was transiently transfected into HeLa cells. The amount (Fig. 1C) and half-life (Fig. 1E) of poly(A)+ HIST1H4K-MT10 mRNA were found to be significantly increased upon UVC irradiation, in agreement with another report (23Ryu I. Park Y. Seo J.W. Park O.H. Ha H. Nam J.W. Kim Y.K. HuR stabilizes a polyadenylated form of replication-dependent histone mRNAs under stress conditions.FASEB J. 2019; 33 (30303743): 2680-269310.1096/fj.201800431RCrossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Of note, the observed increase by UVC irradiation was completely blocked by MG132 treatment (Fig. 1, C and E). In addition, the up-regulation of HIST1H4K-MT10 mRNA upon Puro treatment was reversed by MG132 treatment (Fig. 1, D and F). All these data suggest that stabilization of poly(A)+ RDH mRNA via a PRSE under stressful conditions depends on a proteasomal activity and that a putative labile cellular factor(s) is responsible for rapid degradation of poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs under normal conditions. HuR binds to an ARE or a U-rich sequence (24Ray D. Kazan H. Cook K.B. Weirauch M.T. Najafabadi H.S. Li X. Gueroussov S. Albu M. Zheng H. Yang A. Na H. Irimia M. Matzat L.H. Dale R.K. Smith S.A. et al.A compendium of RNA-binding motifs for decoding gene regulation.Nature. 2013; 499 (23846655): 172-17710.1038/nature12311Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). The PRSE serves as the binding platform for HuR (23Ryu I. Park Y. Seo J.W. Park O.H. Ha H. Nam J.W. Kim Y.K. HuR stabilizes a polyadenylated form of replication-dependent histone mRNAs under stress conditions.FASEB J. 2019; 33 (30303743): 2680-269310.1096/fj.201800431RCrossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), implying the presence of a putative ARE(s) in the PRSE. Indeed, the PRSE sequence contains several putative binding sites for HuR that are similar to the typical ARE consensus motif (A/U)UUU(A/U) (Fig. 2A). To determine whether the stability of poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs is influenced by AMD, we constructed several HIST1H4K-MT10 variants that contain mutations in putative AREs of the PRSE (Fig. 2A). Then, we tested whether the steady-state level of HIST1H4K-MT10 mRNA is affected by the mutations (Fig. 2B). Compared with the intact HIST1H4K-MT10 mRNA, the levels of all the variants increased 3.6–4.6-fold, indicating that poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs are AMD substrates. Of note, among the tested mutants, only HIST1H4K-MT10-A2 mRNA manifested a weak response to UVC irradiation (Fig. 2C), indicating that the second ARE within the PRSE is largely responsible for the stabilization of poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs under stressful conditions. According to our findings that (i) MG132 treatment inhibits the up-regulation of poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs upon exposure to cellular stresses (Fig. 1) and (ii) the AREs in the PRSE are involved in the regulation of poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs, we speculated that a labile decay-promoting ARE-binding protein(s) can facilitate the degradation of poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs. Indeed, it has been reported that some ARE-binding proteins are targeted by proteasomal activity (25Benjamin D. Schmidlin M. Min L. Gross B. Moroni C. BRF1 protein turnover and mRNA decay activity are regulated by protein kinase B at the same phosphorylation sites.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26 (17030608): 9497-950710.1128/MCB.01099-06Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 26Ngoc L.V. Wauquier C. Soin R. Bousbata S. Twyffels L. Kruys V. Gueydan C. Rapid proteasomal degradation of posttranscriptional regulators of the TIS11/tristetraprolin family is induced by an intrinsically unstructured region independently of ubiquitination.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2014; 34 (25246635): 4315-432810.1128/MCB.00643-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To identify the factors that are susceptible to stresses, the expression of previously known ARE-binding proteins was analyzed by Western blotting in total-cell extracts prepared from HeLa cells either pretreated or not pretreated with MG132 and either irradiated with UVC or not (Fig. 2D). The expression of KSRP, AUF1, and HuR was not significantly affected by UVC irradiation. In contrast, the levels of BRF1 and -2 diminished 2.5- and 3.3-fold, respectively, upon UVC irradiation. Furthermore, the expression of BRF1, but not BRF2, was restored by MG132 treatment. Puro treatment yielded a similar pattern except that BRF2 expression was partially restored by MG132 treatment (Fig. 2E). All these data suggest that BRF1 (and possibly BRF2) plays a role in the control of stability of poly(A)+ RDH mRNA. Cellular stresses stabilize poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs probably by invoking degradation of BRFs. Accordingly, cellular stresses may affect an interaction of BRFs with poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs. Therefore, we determined whether BRFs bind to poly(A)+ RDH mRNA and whether their interaction is affected by cellular stresses. To this end, we performed a pulldown assay using in vitro–synthesized biotinylated RNA, either PRSE RNA or PRSE-Rev RNA, and the extracts obtained from UVC-irradiated or nonirradiated HeLa cells (Fig. 3A). The PRSE-Rev RNA served as a negative control because it contains reverse-complementary sequences of the PRSE. Under nonirradiation conditions, HuR specifically associated with the PRSE RNA. This association was gradually augmented by UVC irradiation in a time-dependent manner (3.7-fold at 2 h and 4.9-fold at 4 h). Intriguingly, BRF1, but not BRF2, specifically associated with the PRSE RNA under nonirradiation conditions. In contrast, when the cells were irradiated with UVC, the BRF1 association was reduced 3-fold. Of note, the association of nucleolin (an ARE-binding protein) with the PRSE was marginally affected by UVC irradiation. Next, we investigated whether MG132 can block the UVC-mediated dissociation of BRF1 from the poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs (Fig. 3B). In line with MG132-dependent inhibition of BRF1 degradation (Fig. 2), MG132 treatment blocked the UVC-mediated dissociation of BRF1 from the PRSE. Conversely, the augmented association of HuR with the PRSE upon UVC irradiation was inhibited by MG132, suggesting that HuR competes with BRF1 for binding to the PRSE of poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs. We next tested the possible competition between BRF1 and HuR for binding to PRSE. To this end, we employed in vivo cross-linking followed by RNA pulldown (in vivo RNA pulldown) experiments, which allows for monitoring a direct interaction between RNA-binding proteins and RNAs within the cell (27Park O.H.

HeLa cells were transfected with in vitro–synthesized biotinylated PRSE or PRSE-Rev RNAs. After that, the cells were subjected to in vivo RNA pulldown experiments. The results showed that although the amounts of biotinylated RNAs obtained after in vivo RNA pulldown were comparable before and after UVC irradiation (Fig. 3C), PRSE RNAs, but not PRES-Rev RNAs, associated with both BRF1 and HuR under nonirradiation conditions (Fig. 3D). Notably, UVC irradiation triggered dissociation of BRF1 from PRSE and an association of HuR with PRSE (Fig. 3D), indicating that BRF1 competes with HuR for binding to PRSE in poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs. We next investigated whether BRF1 can trigger rapid degradation of poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs via targeting the PRSE under normal conditions. First, down-regulation of BRF1, but not BRF2, increased the amount of poly(A)+ HIST1H4K-MT10 mRNAs (Figs. 4 and S1), indicating that BRF1 rather than BRF2 functions as the main destabilizing factor for poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs under normal conditions. Second, in line with our observations that HIST1H4K-MT10 variants lacking one of the AREs are up-regulated under normal conditions (Fig. 3), the amount of those variants was not affected by BRF1 down-regulation (Fig. 4, A and B). Third, our half-life analysis revealed that under nonirradiated conditions, all the tested endogenous poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs were rapidly degraded with half-lives ranging from 40.8 to 72.3 min (Fig. 4D). Conversely, UVC irradiation increased the half-lives of poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs 1.6–4.7-fold. Intriguingly, the observed increase in half-life was reversed by overexpression of MYC-BRF1. Of note, neither UVC irradiation nor BRF1 overexpression affected the stability of H3F3A mRNA. Overexpression of BRF1 was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 4C). Taken together, all these data indicate that BRF1 is a bona fide decay-promoting factor for poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs. Alteration of 3′-UTRs of mRNAs is critical for the regulation of gene expression. This event can generate multiple variants of mRNA containing a new repertoire of cis-acting elements, which recruit distinct families of trans-acting factors onto the 3′-UTR of the mRNAs to produce diverse physiological outcomes (16Elkon R. Ugalde A.P. Agami R. Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation: extent, regulation and function.Nat. Rev.

Likewise, the extended 3′-UTR of poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs may contain a new cis-acting element(s), which can serve as a platform for a different regulatory mode of gene expression, as compared with HSL+ RDH mRNAs. In this study, we provide evidence that BRF1 promotes rapid degradation of poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs via an association between BRF1 and AREs within the PRSE in the extended 3′-UTRs. On the basis of our observations, we propose a scenario for post-transcriptional regulation of RDH mRNAs (Fig. 4E). Stem loop–binding protein is cotranscriptionally recruited to the HSL in the 3′-UTR of newly synthesized nascent RDH pre-mRNAs in the nucleus. Then, the histone 3′-end–processing complex is loaded onto the HDE located downstream of the HSL and cleaves a site between HSL and HDE for formation of typical HSL+ RDH mRNAs. If the 3′-end processing is properly completed, mature HSL+ RDH mRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm for translation. However, if the 3′-end processing becomes inefficient or inappropriate because of intrinsic or extrinsic stresses, a putative polyadenylation signal downstream of the HDE will be recognized, thus leading to the formation of poly(A)+ RDH mRNA (6Brocato J.

Even under normal conditions, poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs can be generated by misprocessing of RDH pre-mRNAs (23Ryu I. Park Y. Seo J.W. Park O.H. Ha H. Nam J.W. Kim Y.K.

Therefore, the aberrant poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs should be cleared to maintain a proper ratio of histone protein to DNA. In this regard, the PRSE of poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs can serve as a mediator linking poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs to a surveillance pathway managed by AMD, particularly by BRF1. In conclusion, the present study suggests that the fate of poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs can be modulated via AMD. Although the functional role of poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs under stressful conditions is currently unknown, further attempts to identify their biological function and relation with AMD will help to expand our knowledge on the biology of regulation of histone gene expression.

https://openalex.org/W2939034016,"Caffeine is reported to be the most widely used pharmacologically active substance. It causes mental stimulation and increases blood pressure. Acute systolic and diastolic blood pressure response to caffeine attenuates in the course of regular caffeine use; tolerance to cardiovascular responses develops in some people. For some hypertension-prone people coffee ingestion may be harmful, and for others it may be beneficial. The aim of our work was to evaluate the effect of caffeine on postocclusive reactive hyperaemia (PORH), a test of microvascular function, and at the same time to monitor the central effects of caffeine on blood pressure and heart rate.Heart rate, arterial pressure, and cutaneous laser-Doppler (LD) flux were monitored in 32 healthy volunteers (aged 25.2 ± 4.3 years) before and after they ingested 200 mg of caffeine. LD flux was measured on a finger at rest and after the release of an 8-minute occlusion of digital arteries above the place of LD flux measurement. All parameters obtained after the ingestion of caffeine were compared to the values obtained before caffeine and to the values obtained after a placebo.We found slightly increased arterial pressure as well as decreased heart rate and resting LD flux (Dunnett's test, p<0.05) after the ingestion of caffeine. Caffeine significantly reduced the PORH response (Dunnett's test, p<0.01). The power of the low-frequency oscillations (0.06-0.15 Hz) of LD flux, representing vascular myogenic activity, increased significantly after the ingestion of caffeine at rest and during the PORH response. A correlation was found between the number of cups of coffee regularly consumed and resting LD flux values (R = 0.492, p = 0.00422), peak LD flux values during PORH (R = 0.458, p = 0.00847), and the PORH area (R = 0.506, p = 0.00313) after caffeine consumption.From the results, we can conclude that caffeine affects cutaneous microvascular function during rest and during a PORH response, and that it increases blood pressure and decreases heart rate."

Studies of diseases transmitted by leeches are scarce. The purpose of this study was to analyze the pathogens carried in pond-farmed medicinal leech in China. Leeches were collected from 6 farms in Hubei Province in central China. DNA was extracted from the internal organ of leeches to analyze the origin of blood meal. Leech genera were confirmed through amplification of 18S rRNA and mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene by PCR and host animal species were identified through amplification of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Species of Ehrlichia in the leech specimens were screened with PCR using specific primers. PCR amplification and DNA sequencing showed that 620 leeches were Hirudinaria sp. Ehrlichia DNA was detected in 39 specimens from 2 farms. We obtained a total of 65 sequences of the cytB gene from 620 leech internal organ samples including sequences of human (n = 5), rat (n = 1), domestic pig (n = 10), duck (n = 23), goose (n = 12) and buffalo (n = 14). Phylogenetic analysis of the rrs and groEL gene sequences showed that Ehrlichia detected in the study were closely related to Ehrlichia sp. in ticks from Korea and Japan. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on Ehrlichia DNA being detected from leeches. Our findings provided new data on Ehrlichia spp. and farmed leech species in China."

The role of declining physical health as a risk for depression in elderly men and women remains unclear. We assessed whether declining physical health predicted changes in depression over time among seniors using data from the International Mobility in Aging Study (IMIAS).IMIAS is a longitudinal population-based study of older adults in Canada, Colombia, and Brazil. We assessed change in depression by comparing Center for Epidemiology-Depression (CES-D) scores for 1161 men and women between 2012 and 2016, and used multiple regression to identify whether changes in chronic health conditions, grip strength and self-rated health predicted change in depression over time.Despite worsening physical health measured as chronic health conditions and grip strength, mean CES-D scores decreased from 8.15 (95% CI 7.70-8.60) in 2012 to 7.15 (95% CI 6.75 to 7.56) in 2016. Counterintuitively, women reported increased self-rated health despite having declining physical health, p = 0.004. Decreases in depressive symptoms were aligned with higher CES-D in 2012 and with increases in self-rated health among women and overall, and with high CES-D 2012 and increases in chronic health conditions in men, ps < 0.05.Mental health appears to be a fundamentally different construct than physical health in older adults, allowing seniors to experience improved mood despite declining physical health. Clinicians should not consider depression in elderly populations as an inevitability of aging."

Tube branching is achieved using tube fittings of various shapes, including T, Y, X, and L shapes. This study proposes a new innovative technique to produce T-shaped tubular fittings. The technique uses a specially designed die setup where a tube is placed inside a T-shaped die cavity and a metallic insert is used to deform the tube into the cavity, creating the T-fitting shape. Experimental and numerical methods are used to evaluate the process. The main outcome of this research is the successful creation of T-shaped copper tube fittings using a technique similar to tube hydroforming without the need for internal pressure. This technique could be modified to assist the production of T-fittings with thicknesses outside the hydroforming limits."
