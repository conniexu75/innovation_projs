https://openalex.org/W1963636759,"The enhanced aerodynamic performance of insects results from an interaction of three distinct yet interactive mechanisms: delayed stall, rotational circulation, and wake capture. Delayed stall functions during the translational portions of the stroke, when the wings sweep through the air with a large angle of attack. In contrast, rotational circulation and wake capture generate aerodynamic forces during stroke reversals, when the wings rapidly rotate and change direction. In addition to contributing to the lift required to keep an insect aloft, these two rotational mechanisms provide a potent means by which the animal can modulate the direction and magnitude of flight forces during steering maneuvers. A comprehensive theory incorporating both translational and rotational mechanisms may explain the diverse patterns of wing motion displayed by different species of insects."
https://openalex.org/W2012255417,"In contrast with the prevailing view that most tumors and metastases begin as avascular masses, evidence is presented here that a subset of tumors instead initially grows by coopting existing host vessels. This coopted host vasculature does not immediately undergo angiogenesis to support the tumor but instead regresses, leading to a secondarily avascular tumor and massive tumor cell loss. Ultimately, however, the remaining tumor is rescued by robust angiogenesis at the tumor margin. The expression patterns of the angiogenic antagonist angiopoietin-2 and of pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) suggest that these proteins may be critical regulators of this balance between vascular regression and growth."

Functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy humans was applied to dissociate neural activation patterns associated with acute pain and its anticipation. Expectation of pain activated sites within the medial frontal lobe, insular cortex, and cerebellum distinct from, but close to, locations mediating pain experience itself. Anticipation of pain can in its own right cause mood changes and behavioral adaptations that exacerbate the suffering experienced by chronic pain patients. Selective manipulations of activity at these sites may offer therapeutic possibilities for treating chronic pain."

https://openalex.org/W2033791639,"The signaling molecules that elicit embryonic induction of the liver from the mammalian gut endoderm or induction of other gut-derived organs are unknown. Close proximity of cardiac mesoderm, which expresses fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) 1, 2, and 8, causes the foregut endoderm to develop into the liver. Treatment of isolated foregut endoderm from mouse embryos with FGF1 or FGF2, but not FGF8, was sufficient to replace cardiac mesoderm as an inducer of the liver gene expression program, the latter being the first step of hepatogenesis. The hepatogenic response was restricted to endoderm tissue, which selectively coexpresses FGF receptors 1 and 4. Further studies with FGFs and their specific inhibitors showed that FGF8 contributes to the morphogenetic outgrowth of the hepatic endoderm. Thus, different FGF signals appear to initiate distinct phases of liver development during mammalian organogenesis."

We show here that disc cells have thin, actin-based extensions (cytonemes) that project to this signaling center. Cytonemes can be induced when cells from the lateral flanks of a wing disc are cultured next to cells from the A/P border or next to a source of fibroblast growth factor. Mouse limb bud cells also grow projections during a brief culture period, indicating that cytonemes are an attribute of both vertebrate and invertebrate cells. We suggest that cytonemes may be responsible for some forms of long-range cell–cell communication."

Associated with the cap structure at yeast telomeres is a subtelomeric domain of heterochromatin, containing the silent information regulator (SIR) complex. The Ku70/80 heterodimer (yKu) is associated both with the chromosome end and with subtelomeric chromatin. Surprisingly, both yKu and the chromatin-associated Rap1 and SIR proteins are released from telomeres in a RAD9-dependent response to DNA damage. yKu is recruited rapidly to double-strand cuts, while low levels of SIR proteins are detected near cleavage sites at later time points. Consistently, yKu- or SIR-deficient strains are hypersensitive to DNA-damaging agents. The release of yKu from telomeric chromatin may allow efficient scanning of the genome for DNA strand breaks."

The homologous enzyme succinate dehydrogenase also plays a prominent role in cellular energetics as a member of the Krebs cycle and as complex II of the aerobic respiratory chain. Fumarate reductase consists of four subunits that contain a covalently linked flavin adenine dinucleotide, three different iron-sulfur clusters, and at least two quinones. The crystal structure of intact fumarate reductase has been solved at 3.3 angstrom resolution and demonstrates that the cofactors are arranged in a nearly linear manner from the membrane-bound quinone to the active site flavin. Although fumarate reductase is not associated with any proton-pumping function, the two quinones are positioned on opposite sides of the membrane in an arrangement similar to that of the Q-cycle organization observed for cytochrome bc 1 ."

Croquemort (CRQ) is a CD36-related receptor expressed exclusively on these macrophages. Genetic evidence showed that crq was essential for efficient phagocytosis of apoptotic corpses but was not required for the engulfment of bacteria. The expression of CRQ was regulated by the amount of apoptosis. These data define distinct pathways for the phagocytosis of corpses and bacteria in Drosophila.

https://openalex.org/W1985544638,"The yeast Sir2/3/4p complex is found in abundance at telomeres, where it participates in the formation of silent heterochromatin and telomere maintenance. Here, we show that Sir3p is released from telomeres in response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), binds to DSBs, and mediates their repair, independent of cell mating type. Sir3p relocalization is S phase specific and, importantly, requires the DNA damage checkpoint genes MEC1 and RAD9. MEC1 is a homolog of ATM, mutations in which cause ataxia telangiectasia (A-T), a disease characterized by various neurologic and immunologic abnormalities, a predisposition for cancer, and a cellular defect in repair of DSBs. This novel mode by which preformed DNA repair machinery is mobilized by DNA damage sensors may have implications for human diseases resulting from defective DSB repair."

A 60-kilodalton fucosyltransferase (FTase) that adds this residue was purified from pea epicotyls. Peptide sequence information from the pea FTase allowed the cloning of a homologous gene, AtFT1, from Arabidopsis.

The 1.15 Å structure of the Vps27p FYVE domain reveals two antiparallel β sheets and an α helix stabilized by two Zn2+-binding clusters. The core secondary structures are similar to a rabphilin-3A Zn2+-binding domain and to the C1 and LIM domains. Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate binds to a pocket formed by the (R/K)(R/K)HHCR motif. A lattice contact shows how anionic ligands can interact with the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-binding site. The tip of the FYVE domain has basic and hydrophobic surfaces positioned so that nonspecific interactions with the phospholipid bilayer can abet specific binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate.

https://openalex.org/W1558737283,"Chromatin packaging in mammalian spermatozoa requires an ordered replacement of the somatic histones by two classes of spermatid-specific basic proteins, the transition proteins and the protamines. Temporal expression of transition proteins and protamines during spermatid differentiation is under translational control, and premature translation of protamine 1 leads to precocious nuclear condensation and sterility. We have previously suggested that the double-stranded (ds) RNA binding protein Prbp (encoded by the gene Tarbp2) functions as a translational regulator during mouse spermatogenesis. Here we show that Prbp is required for proper translational activation of the mRNAs encoding the protamines. We generated mice that carry a targeted disruption of Tarbp2 and determined that they were sterile and severely oligospermic. Using immunohistological analysis, we determined that the endogenous Prm2 mRNA and a reporter mRNA carrying protamine 1 translational-control elements were translated in a mosaic pattern. We showed that failure to synthesize the protamines resulted in delayed replacement of the transition proteins and subsequent failure of spermiation. The timing of Prbp expression suggests that it may function as a chaperone in the assembly of specific translationally regulated ribonucleoprotein particles."

To define the function of plakophilin-1 in desmosome assembly, interactions among the desmosomal cadherins, desmoplakin, and the armadillo family members plakoglobin and plakophilin-1 were examined. In transient expression assays, plakophilin-1 formed complexes with a desmoplakin amino-terminal domain and enhanced its recruitment to cell-cell borders; this recruitment was not dependent on the equimolar expression of desmosomal cadherins. In contrast to desmoplakin-plakoglobin interactions, the interaction between desmoplakin and plakophilin-1 was not mediated by the armadillo repeat domain of plakophilin-1 but by the non-armadillo head domain, as assessed by yeast two-hybrid and recruitment assays. We propose a model whereby plakoglobin serves as a linker between the cadherins and desmoplakin, whereas plakophilin-1 enhances lateral interactions between desmoplakin molecules.

PKP-1 was originally identified as Band 6, a 75-kDa keratin-associated protein component of desmosomes in stratified tissues (17Kapprell H.-P. Owaribe K. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1679-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). PKP-1 is also part of the armadillo gene family (18Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B.

In overlay assays, PKP-1 was recently found to bind to a number of desmosomal components, including desmoplakin and intermediate filament polypeptides (10Smith E.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which PKP-1 contributes to desmosome assembly and attachment to intermediate filaments remains unknown.We report here that the non-armadillo head domain of PKP-1 binds directly to the amino-terminal domain of desmoplakin and enhances its recruitment to cell junctions. Our data indicate that PKP-1 is a desmoplakin-binding partner in the desmosomal plaque and suggest a model by which PKP-1 recruits desmoplakin to desmosomes by increasing lateral interactions between junction components.DISCUSSIONThe results presented here provide insights into both the molecular basis of a cutaneous disorder in patients lacking PKP-1 (16McGrath J.A. McMillan J.R. Shemanko C.S. Runswick S.K. Leigh I.M. Lane E.B. Garrod D.R. Eady R.A.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and into the role of PKP-1 in desmosome assembly. In addition to binding to keratins (10Smith E.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 17Kapprell H.-P. Owaribe K. Franke W.W. J.

Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2259-2270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PKP-1 may also facilitate intermediate filament attachment to the desmosomal plaque by enhancing desmoplakin recruitment to the desmosome. In patients lacking PKP-1, epidermal fragility and blistering would be predicted because of the loss of intermediate filament-binding proteins in the desmosome. The head domain of PKP-1 but not the armadillo repeat domain binds to and recruits desmoplakin to cell borders (Figs. 1 and 4), highlighting a fundamental difference between PKP-1 and plakoglobin. In the case of plakoglobin, desmoplakin binds directly to the central armadillo motifs, and, although the first three repeats retain some binding ability, the entire collection of 13 repeats is required for a robust interaction (not shown). The fact that the PKP-1 armadillo domain remained diffuse in the cytoplasm was somewhat surprising because the arm repeats of plakoglobin, β-catenin, p120, and p0071 3M. Hatzfeld, M. Ruediger, and E. Klaile, unpublished observations. all bind to cadherins (31Hatzfeld M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 186: 179-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKP-1 does bind to some desmosomal cadherins when tested by in vitro overlay assays 4M. Hatzfeld, unpublished observations.(10Smith E.A. Fuchs E. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14075-14080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and PKP-1 did interact with Dsg1 in the yeast two-hybrid assay. However, the interaction was between Dsg1 and the non-armadillo head domain of PKP-1 (Fig. 4). Furthermore, in contrast to plakoglobin (8Kowalczyk A.P. Bornslaeger E.A. Borgwardt J.E. Palka H.L. Dhaliwal A.S. Corcoran C.M. Denning M.F. Green K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 23Kowalczyk A.P. Navarro P. Dejana E. Bornslaeger E.A. Green K.J. Kopp D.S. Borgwardt J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3045-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), transfection experiments demonstrated that full-length PKP-1 does not require co-expression with a cadherin to localize and recruit DP-NTP to cell-cell borders (Fig. 1). It is possible that PKP-1 preferentially associates with certain isoforms of desmosomal cadherins that are co-expressed with PKP-1 during epidermal differentiation, such as Dsg1 and or Dsc1. However, it appears that the primary binding partner for PKP-1 is desmoplakin and that equimolar amounts of cadherin·PKP-1 are not required for PKP-1 assembly into the plaque.Previous studies suggest that lateral interactions among desmosomal components are critical to the assembly process (8Kowalczyk A.P. Bornslaeger E.A. Borgwardt J.E. Palka H.L. Dhaliwal A.S. Corcoran C.M. Denning M.F. Green K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 10Smith E.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Together with the data presented here showing that PKP-1 enhances desmoplakin recruitment to the plasma membrane, these observations are consistent with the model in Fig. 5. In the absence of PKP-1, the number of available desmosomal cadherin-plakoglobin complexes would limit the total amount of desmoplakin present at the junction. However, the presence of PKP-1 would overcome this limitation by providing additional desmoplakin-binding sites at the membrane. Consistent with this, increased desmosomal localization of endogenous desmoplakin was observed in COS cells transiently expressing PKP-1 (not shown). The model also predicts that PKP-1 could associate laterally with multiple desmoplakin molecules, which might occur if PKP-1 forms dimers or multimers or if each PKP-1 molecule has multiple desmoplakin-binding sites. Because our present data cannot provide quantitative information on the stoichiometry of PKP-1·DP complexes, future work will be needed to test these possibilities. However, if PKP-1 were to associate with at least two desmoplakin molecules, this would provide an explanation for its ability to enhance DP-NTP recruitment to cell borders in the absence of exogenously expressed cadherins and plakoglobin. Secondary interactions between PKP-1 and the desmosomal cadherins might also occur, leading to further strengthening of the adhesive complex (see also Ref. 10Smith E.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).The data presented in this study also suggest that plakoglobin and PKP-1 exhibit fundamentally different modes of assembly into the desmosomal plaque, with plakoglobin linking desmosomal cadherins to desmoplakin and PKP-1 functioning largely in lateral interactions. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that desmosomes in suprabasal layers of the epidermis are larger than simple epithelial desmosomes or desmosomes from basal cells. During epidermal differentiation, desmosomes may increase in size and stability because of insertion of PKP-1/DP-complexes, thereby enhancing desmosome interactions with the cytoskeleton and rendering cells more resistant to mechanical stress. Presumably, this architectural arrangement of both linear and lateral interactions provides for a strong adhesive junction with multiple protein-protein interactions as targets for cellular regulation. Desmosomes are intercellular adhesive junctions that act as anchorage points for intermediate filament networks. The desmosomal cadherins, desmogleins and desmocollins, bind directly to the cytoplasmic protein plakoglobin (1Cowin P. Burke B. Curr. Opin.

Med. 1995; 181: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) severely compromises tissue integrity and function. Recently, the first human genetic disorders involving mutations in desmosomal genes have been reported. Haploinsufficiency of desmoplakin results in the disruption of intermediate filament interactions with desmosomes in palmoplantar epidermis (15Armstrong D.K.B. McKenna K.E. Purkis P. Green K.J. Eady R.A.J. Leigh I.M. Hughes A.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In addition, mutation of both alleles of plakophilin-1 (PKP-1) 1The abbreviations used are: PKP-1, plakophilin-1; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CMV, cytomegalovirus; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.1The abbreviations used are: PKP-1, plakophilin-1; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CMV, cytomegalovirus; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.and consequent loss of the protein causes epidermal fragility, perturbed desmoplakin localization, and detachment of intermediate filaments from the plasma membrane of keratinocytes (16McGrath J.A. McMillan J.R. Shemanko C.S. Runswick S.K. Leigh I.M. Lane E.B. Garrod D.R. Eady R.A.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). PKP-1 was originally identified as Band 6, a 75-kDa keratin-associated protein component of desmosomes in stratified tissues (17Kapprell H.-P. Owaribe K. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1679-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). PKP-1 is also part of the armadillo gene family (18Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 19Hatzfeld M. Kristjansson G.I. Plessmann U. Weber K. J.

Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1009-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In overlay assays, PKP-1 was recently found to bind to a number of desmosomal components, including desmoplakin and intermediate filament polypeptides (10Smith E.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which PKP-1 contributes to desmosome assembly and attachment to intermediate filaments remains unknown. We report here that the non-armadillo head domain of PKP-1 binds directly to the amino-terminal domain of desmoplakin and enhances its recruitment to cell junctions. Our data indicate that PKP-1 is a desmoplakin-binding partner in the desmosomal plaque and suggest a model by which PKP-1 recruits desmoplakin to desmosomes by increasing lateral interactions between junction components. DISCUSSIONThe results presented here provide insights into both the molecular basis of a cutaneous disorder in patients lacking PKP-1 (16McGrath J.A. McMillan J.R. Shemanko C.S. Runswick S.K. Leigh I.M. Lane E.B. Garrod D.R. Eady R.A.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and into the role of PKP-1 in desmosome assembly. In addition to binding to keratins (10Smith E.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 17Kapprell H.-P. Owaribe K. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1679-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 19Hatzfeld M. Kristjansson G.I. Plessmann U. Weber K. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2259-2270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PKP-1 may also facilitate intermediate filament attachment to the desmosomal plaque by enhancing desmoplakin recruitment to the desmosome. In patients lacking PKP-1, epidermal fragility and blistering would be predicted because of the loss of intermediate filament-binding proteins in the desmosome. The head domain of PKP-1 but not the armadillo repeat domain binds to and recruits desmoplakin to cell borders (Figs. 1 and 4), highlighting a fundamental difference between PKP-1 and plakoglobin. In the case of plakoglobin, desmoplakin binds directly to the central armadillo motifs, and, although the first three repeats retain some binding ability, the entire collection of 13 repeats is required for a robust interaction (not shown). The fact that the PKP-1 armadillo domain remained diffuse in the cytoplasm was somewhat surprising because the arm repeats of plakoglobin, β-catenin, p120, and p0071 3M. Hatzfeld, M. Ruediger, and E. Klaile, unpublished observations. all bind to cadherins (31Hatzfeld M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 186: 179-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKP-1 does bind to some desmosomal cadherins when tested by in vitro overlay assays 4M. Hatzfeld, unpublished observations.(10Smith E.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 32Mathur M. Goodwin L. Cowin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14075-14080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and PKP-1 did interact with Dsg1 in the yeast two-hybrid assay. However, the interaction was between Dsg1 and the non-armadillo head domain of PKP-1 (Fig. 4). Furthermore, in contrast to plakoglobin (8Kowalczyk A.P. Bornslaeger E.A. Borgwardt J.E. Palka H.L. Dhaliwal A.S. Corcoran C.M. Denning M.F. Green K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 23Kowalczyk A.P. Navarro P. Dejana E. Bornslaeger E.A. Green K.J. Kopp D.S. Borgwardt J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3045-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), transfection experiments demonstrated that full-length PKP-1 does not require co-expression with a cadherin to localize and recruit DP-NTP to cell-cell borders (Fig. 1). It is possible that PKP-1 preferentially associates with certain isoforms of desmosomal cadherins that are co-expressed with PKP-1 during epidermal differentiation, such as Dsg1 and or Dsc1. However, it appears that the primary binding partner for PKP-1 is desmoplakin and that equimolar amounts of cadherin·PKP-1 are not required for PKP-1 assembly into the plaque.Previous studies suggest that lateral interactions among desmosomal components are critical to the assembly process (8Kowalczyk A.P. Bornslaeger E.A. Borgwardt J.E. Palka H.L. Dhaliwal A.S. Corcoran C.M. Denning M.F. Green K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 10Smith E.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Together with the data presented here showing that PKP-1 enhances desmoplakin recruitment to the plasma membrane, these observations are consistent with the model in Fig. 5. In the absence of PKP-1, the number of available desmosomal cadherin-plakoglobin complexes would limit the total amount of desmoplakin present at the junction. However, the presence of PKP-1 would overcome this limitation by providing additional desmoplakin-binding sites at the membrane. Consistent with this, increased desmosomal localization of endogenous desmoplakin was observed in COS cells transiently expressing PKP-1 (not shown). The model also predicts that PKP-1 could associate laterally with multiple desmoplakin molecules, which might occur if PKP-1 forms dimers or multimers or if each PKP-1 molecule has multiple desmoplakin-binding sites. Because our present data cannot provide quantitative information on the stoichiometry of PKP-1·DP complexes, future work will be needed to test these possibilities. However, if PKP-1 were to associate with at least two desmoplakin molecules, this would provide an explanation for its ability to enhance DP-NTP recruitment to cell borders in the absence of exogenously expressed cadherins and plakoglobin. Secondary interactions between PKP-1 and the desmosomal cadherins might also occur, leading to further strengthening of the adhesive complex (see also Ref. 10Smith E.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).The data presented in this study also suggest that plakoglobin and PKP-1 exhibit fundamentally different modes of assembly into the desmosomal plaque, with plakoglobin linking desmosomal cadherins to desmoplakin and PKP-1 functioning largely in lateral interactions. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that desmosomes in suprabasal layers of the epidermis are larger than simple epithelial desmosomes or desmosomes from basal cells. During epidermal differentiation, desmosomes may increase in size and stability because of insertion of PKP-1/DP-complexes, thereby enhancing desmosome interactions with the cytoskeleton and rendering cells more resistant to mechanical stress. Presumably, this architectural arrangement of both linear and lateral interactions provides for a strong adhesive junction with multiple protein-protein interactions as targets for cellular regulation.

Here, the human U11/U12 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), a subunit of the minor (U12-dependent) spliceosome, was isolated. Twenty U11/U12 proteins were identified, including subsets unique to the minor spliceosome or common to both spliceosomes. Common proteins include four U2 snRNP polypeptides that constitute the essential splicing factor SF3b. A 35-kilodalton U11-associated protein homologous to the U1 snRNP 70K protein was also identified. These data provide fundamental information about proteins of the minor spliceosome and shed light on its evolutionary relationship to the major spliceosome."
https://openalex.org/W1989034907,"Neurotrophins have been implicated in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, but the underlying intracellular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Synaptic potentiation induced by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but not neurotrophin 3, was prevented by blockers of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) signaling. Activators of cAMP signaling alone were ineffective in modifying synaptic efficacy but greatly enhanced the potentiation effect of BDNF. Blocking cAMP signaling abolished the facilitation of BDNF-induced potentiation by presynaptic activity. Thus synaptic actions of BDNF are gated by cAMP. Activity and other coincident signals that modulate cAMP concentrations may specify the action of secreted neurotrophins on developing nerve terminals."

The seasonal amplitude of net ecosystem carbon exchange by northern Siberian ecosystems is shown to be greater in disturbed than undisturbed sites, due to increased summer influx and increased winter efflux. Increased disturbance could therefore contribute significantly to the amplified seasonal cycle of atmospheric carbon dioxide at high latitudes. Warm temperatures reduced summer carbon influx, suggesting that high-latitude warming, if it occurred, would be unlikely to increase seasonal amplitude of carbon exchange."
