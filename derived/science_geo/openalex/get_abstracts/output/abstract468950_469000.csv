https://openalex.org/W1977376374,"'Food addiction' shares a similar neurobiological and behavioral framework with substance addiction. However whether, and to what degree, 'food addiction' contributes to obesity in the general population is unknown.to assess 1) the prevalence of 'food addiction' in the Newfoundland population; 2) if clinical symptom counts of 'food addiction' were significantly correlated with the body composition measurements; 3) if food addicts were significantly more obese than controls, and 4) if macronutrient intakes are associated with 'food addiction'.A total of 652 adults (415 women, 237 men) recruited from the general population participated in this study. Obesity was evaluated by Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Fat percentage measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. 'Food addiction' was assessed using the Yale Food Addiction Scale and macronutrient intake was determined from the Willet Food Frequency Questionnaire.The prevalence of 'food addiction' was 5.4% (6.7% in females and 3.0% in males) and increased with obesity status. The clinical symptom counts of 'food addiction' were positively correlated with all body composition measurements across the entire sample (p<0.001). Obesity measurements were significantly higher in food addicts than controls; Food addicts were 11.7 (kg) heavier, 4.6 BMI units higher, and had 8.2% more body fat and 8.5% more trunk fat. Furthermore, food addicts consumed more calories from fat and protein compared with controls.Our results demonstrated that 'food addiction' contributes to severity of obesity and body composition measurements from normal weight to obese individuals in the general population with higher rate in women as compared to men."
https://openalex.org/W2032871452,"Objective There is ongoing debate on whether health literacy represents a skill-based construct for health self-management, or if it also more broadly captures personal ‘activation’ or motivation to manage health. This research examines 1) the association between patient activation and health literacy as they are most commonly measured and 2) the independent and combined associations of patient activation and health literacy skills with physical and mental health. Methods A secondary analysis of baseline cross-sectional data from the LitCog cohort of older adults was used. Participants (n = 697) were recruited from multiple US-based health centers. During structured face-to-face interviews, participants completed the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA), the Patient Activation Measure (PAM), the SF-36 physical health summary subscale, and Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Service (PROMIS) short form subscales for depression and anxiety. Results The relationship between health literacy and patient activation was weak, but significant (r = 0.11, p<0.01). In models adjusted for participant characteristics, lower health literacy was associated with worse physical health (β = 0.13, p<0.001) and depression (β = −0.16, p<0.001). Lower patient activation was associated with worse physical health (β = 0.19, p<0.001), depression (β = −0.27, p<0.001) and anxiety (β-0.24, p<0.001). Conclusions The most common measures of health literacy and patient activation are weakly correlated with each other, but also independently correlated with health outcomes. This suggests health literacy represents a distinct skill-based construct, supporting the Institute of Medicine’s definition. Deficits in either construct could be useful targets for behavioral intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2053172006,"Virus infection is restricted by intracellular immune responses in host cells, and this is typically modulated by stimulation of cytokines. The cytokines and host factors that determine the host cell restriction against hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are not well understood. We screened 36 cytokines and chemokines to determine which were able to reduce the susceptibility of HepaRG cells to HBV infection. Here, we found that pretreatment with IL-1β and TNFα remarkably reduced the host cell susceptibility to HBV infection. This effect was mediated by activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. A cytidine deaminase, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), was up-regulated by both IL-1β and TNFα in a variety of hepatocyte cell lines and primary human hepatocytes. Another deaminase APOBEC3G was not induced by these proinflammatory cytokines. Knockdown of AID expression impaired the anti-HBV effect of IL-1β, and overexpression of AID antagonized HBV infection, suggesting that AID was one of the responsible factors for the anti-HBV activity of IL-1/TNFα. Although AID induced hypermutation of HBV DNA, this activity was dispensable for the anti-HBV activity. The antiviral effect of IL-1/TNFα was also observed on different HBV genotypes but not on hepatitis C virus. These results demonstrate that proinflammatory cytokines IL-1/TNFα trigger a novel antiviral mechanism involving AID to regulate host cell permissiveness to HBV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2150499718,"Background Cyanobacteria play a significant role in the global carbon cycle. In Synechococcus elongatus, the carbon-fixing enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) is concentrated into polyhedral, proteinaceous compartments called carboxysomes. Methodology/Principal Findings Using live cell fluorescence microscopy, we show that carboxysomes are first detected as small seeds of RuBisCO that colocalize with existing carboxysomes. These seeds contain little or no shell protein, but increase in RuBisCO content over several hours, during which time they are exposed to the solvent. The maturing seed is then enclosed by shell proteins, a rapid process that seals RuBisCO from the cytosol to establish a distinct, solvent-protected microenvironment that is oxidizing relative to the cytosol. These closure events can be spatially and temporally coincident with the appearance of a nascent daughter RuBisCO seed. Conclusions/Significance Carboxysomes assemble in a stepwise fashion, inside-to-outside, revealing that cargo is the principle organizer of this compartment’s biogenesis. Our observations of the spatial relationship of seeds to previously formed carboxysomes lead us to propose a model for carboxysome replication via sequential fission, polymerization, and encapsulation of their internal cargo."
https://openalex.org/W2139351654,"This paper describes a hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) technique that combines the P300 potential, the steady state visually evoked potential (SSVEP), and event related de-synchronization (ERD) to solve a complicated multi-task problem consisting of humanoid robot navigation and control along with object recognition using a low-cost BCI system. Our approach enables subjects to control the navigation and exploration of a humanoid robot and recognize a desired object among candidates. This study aims to demonstrate the possibility of a hybrid BCI based on a low-cost system for a realistic and complex task. It also shows that the use of a simple image processing technique, combined with BCI, can further aid in making these complex tasks simpler. An experimental scenario is proposed in which a subject remotely controls a humanoid robot in a properly sized maze. The subject sees what the surrogate robot sees through visual feedback and can navigate the surrogate robot. While navigating, the robot encounters objects located in the maze. It then recognizes if the encountered object is of interest to the subject. The subject communicates with the robot through SSVEP and ERD-based BCIs to navigate and explore with the robot, and P300-based BCI to allow the surrogate robot recognize their favorites. Using several evaluation metrics, the performances of five subjects navigating the robot were quite comparable to manual keyboard control. During object recognition mode, favorite objects were successfully selected from two to four choices. Subjects conducted humanoid navigation and recognition tasks as if they embodied the robot. Analysis of the data supports the potential usefulness of the proposed hybrid BCI system for extended applications. This work presents an important implication for the future work that a hybridization of simple BCI protocols provide extended controllability to carry out complicated tasks even with a low-cost system."
https://openalex.org/W2011506319,"A combination of hyperthermia with radiotherapy and chemotherapy for various solid tumors has been practiced clinically. However, hyperthermic therapy has side effects, such as thrombocytopenia. Up to now, the pathogenesis of hyperthermia-induced thrombocytopenia remains unclear. Previous studies have shown that hyperthermia induces platelet apoptosis. However, the signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms involved in hyperthermia-induced platelet apoptosis have not been determined. Here we show that hyperthermia induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial ROS generation in a time-dependent manner in platelets. The mitochondria-targeted ROS scavenger Mito-TEMPO blocked intracellular ROS and mitochondrial ROS generation. By contrast, inhibitors of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase did not. Furthermore, Mito-TEMPO inhibited hyperthermia-induced malonyldialdehyde production and cardiolipin peroxidation. We also showed that hyperthermia-triggered platelet apoptosis was inhibited by Mito-TEMPO. Furthermore, Mito-TEMPO ameliorated hyperthermia-impaired platelet aggregation and adhesion function. Lastly, hyperthermia decreased platelet manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) protein levels and enzyme activity. These data indicate that mitochondrial ROS play a pivotal role in hyperthermia-induced platelet apoptosis, and decreased of MnSOD activity might, at least partially account for the enhanced ROS levels in hyperthermia-treated platelets. Therefore, determining the role of mitochondrial ROS as contributory factors in platelet apoptosis, is critical in providing a rational design of novel drugs aimed at targeting mitochondrial ROS. Such therapeutic approaches would have potential clinical utility in platelet-associated disorders involving oxidative damage."
https://openalex.org/W2141236632,"Qualifications such as ""global warming hysteria"" and ""energy policy schizophrenia"" put forward by some climate change skeptics, usually outside the academic arena, may suggest that people who seriously worry about the environment suffer from psychological imbalance. The present study aimed to refute this thesis. While habitual worrying in general is strongly associated with psychopathological symptoms, in a survey a near-zero correlation was found between habitual ecological worrying and pathological worry. Instead, habitual ecological worrying was associated with pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors, and with a personality structure characterized by imagination and an appreciation for new ideas. The study had sufficient statistical power and measures were valid and reliable. The results confirm that those who habitually worry about the ecology are not only lacking in any psychopathology, but demonstrate a constructive and adaptive response to a serious problem. In the public domain, these findings may contribute to a more rational and less emotional debate on climate change and to the prevention of stigmatization of people who are genuinely concerned about our habitat and are prepared to do something about it (""habitual worriers are not crazy""). In the academic arena this study may contribute to environmental psychology (""habitual worrying is part of a green identity""), as well as to the literature on worry and anxiety (""habitual worrying can be a constructive response"")."
https://openalex.org/W2122897710,"Here, we report that a unique mechanism of action exerted by stem cells in the repair of the traumatically injured brain involves their ability to harness a biobridge between neurogenic niche and injured brain site. This biobridge, visualized immunohistochemically and laser captured, corresponded to an area between the neurogenic subventricular zone and the injured cortex. That the biobridge expressed high levels of extracellular matrix metalloproteinases characterized initially by a stream of transplanted stem cells, but subsequently contained only few to non-detectable grafts and overgrown by newly formed host cells, implicates a novel property of stem cells. The transplanted stem cells manifest themselves as pathways for trafficking the migration of host neurogenic cells, but once this biobridge is formed between the neurogenic site and the injured brain site, the grafted cells disappear and relinquish their task to the host neurogenic cells. Our findings reveal that long-distance migration of host cells from the neurogenic niche to the injured brain site can be achieved through transplanted stem cells serving as biobridges for initiation of endogenous repair mechanisms. This is the first report of a stem cell-paved “biobridge”. Indeed, to date the two major schools of discipline in stem cell repair mechanism primarily support the concept of “cell replacement” and bystander effects of “trophic factor secretion”. The present novel observations of a stem cell seducing a host cell to engage in brain repair advances basic science concepts on stem cell biology and extracellular matrix, as well as provokes translational research on propagating this stem cell-paved biobridge beyond cell replacement and trophic factor secretion for the treatment of traumatic brain injury and other neurological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2036424134,"Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized in part by an elevated inflammatory status, and “modified exercise” is currently proposed as being a good therapeutic help for these patients. However, the mechanisms involved in the exercise-induced benefits are still poorly understood. The objective was to evaluate the effect of a single bout of moderate cycling (45 min at 55% VO2 max) on the inflammatory (serum IL-8; chemotaxis and O2− production by neutrophils; and IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-18 release by monocytes) and stress (cortisol; NA; and eHsp72) responses in women diagnosed with FM compared with an aged-matched control group of healthy women (HW). IL-8, NA, and eHsp72 were determined by ELISA. Cytokines released by monocytes were determined by Bio-Plex® system (LUMINEX). Cortisol was determined by electrochemoluminiscence, chemotaxis was evaluated in Boyden chambers and O2− production by NBT reduction. In the FM patients, the exercise induced a decrease in the systemic concentration of IL-8, cortisol, NA, and eHsp72; as well as in the neutrophil’s chemotaxis and O2− production and in the inflammatory cytokine release by monocytes. This was contrary to the completely expected exercise-induced increase in all those biomarkers in HW. In conclusion, single sessions of moderate cycling can improve the inflammatory status in FM patients, reaching values close to the situation of aged-matched HW at their basal status. The neuroendocrine mechanism seems to be an exercise-induced decrease in the stress response of these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2074275052,"Tooth implantation provides important phylogenetic and functional information about the dentitions of amniotes. Traditionally, only mammals and crocodilians have been considered truly thecodont, because their tooth roots are coated in layers of cementum for anchorage of the periodontal ligament, which is in turn attached to the bone lining the alveolus, the alveolar bone. The histological properties and developmental origins of these three periodontal tissues have been studied extensively in mammals and crocodilians, but the identities of the periodontal tissues in other amniotes remain poorly studied. Early work on dental histology of basal amniotes concluded that most possess a simplified tooth attachment in which the tooth root is ankylosed to a pedestal composed of ""bone of attachment"", which is in turn fused to the jaw. More recent studies have concluded that stereotypically thecodont tissues are also present in non-mammalian, non-crocodilian amniotes, but these studies were limited to crown groups or secondarily aquatic reptiles. As the sister group to Amniota, and the first tetrapods to exhibit dental occlusion, diadectids are the ideal candidates for studies of dental evolution among terrestrial vertebrates because they can be used to test hypotheses of development and homology in deep time. Our study of Permo-Carboniferous diadectid tetrapod teeth and dental tissues reveal the presence of two types of cementum, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone, and therefore the earliest record of true thecodonty in a tetrapod. These discoveries in a stem amniote allow us to hypothesize that the ability to produce the tissues that characterize thecodonty in mammals and crocodilians is very ancient and plesiomorphic for Amniota. Consequently, all other forms of tooth implantation in crown amniotes are derived arrangements of one or more of these periodontal tissues and not simply ankylosis of teeth to the jaw by plesiomorphically retaining ""bone of attachment"", as previously suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1978741663,"The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a major phenotype of cancer metastasis and invasion. As a druggable cancer target, the inhibition of protein kinase CK2 (formally named to casein kinase 2) has been suggested as a promising therapeutic strategy to treat EMT-controlled cancer metastasis. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 on the processes of cancer migration and invasion during the EMT in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells.The effect of CX-4945 on TGF-β1-induced EMT was evaluated in A549 cells treated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) and CX-4945. The effect of CX-4945 on TGF-β1-induced cadherin switch and activation of key signaling molecules involved in Smad, non-Smad, Wnt and focal adhesion signaling pathways were investigated by Western blot analysis, immunocytochemistry and reporter assay. Additionally, the effect of CX-4945 on TGF-β1-induced migration and invasion was investigated by wound healing assay, Boyden chamber assay, gelatin zymography, and the quantitative real-time PCR.CX-4945 inhibits the TGF-β1-induced cadherin switch and the activation of key signaling molecules involved in Smad (Smad2/3, Twist and Snail), non-Smad (Akt and Erk), Wnt (β-catenin) and focal adhesion signaling pathways (FAK, Src and paxillin) that cooperatively regulate the overall process of EMT. As a result, CX-4945 inhibits the migration and invasion of A549 cells accompanied with the downregulation of MMP-2 and 9.Clinical evaluation of CX-4945 in humans as a single agent in solid tumors and multiple myeloma has established its promising pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety profiles. Beyond regression of tumor mass, CX-4945 may be advanced as a new therapy for cancer metastasis and EMT-related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1979691822,"Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) is highly expressed by lymphatic endothelial cells and has been shown to stimulate lymphangiogenesis in adult mice. However, the role VEGFR2 serves in the development of the lymphatic vascular system has not been defined. Here we use the Cre-lox system to show that the proper development of the lymphatic vasculature requires VEGFR2 expression by lymphatic endothelium. We show that Lyve-1(wt/Cre);Vegfr2(flox/flox) mice possess significantly fewer dermal lymphatic vessels than Vegfr2(flox/flox) mice. Although Lyve-1(wt/Cre);Vegfr2(flox/flox) mice exhibit lymphatic hypoplasia, the lymphatic network is functional and contains all of the key features of a normal lymphatic network (initial lymphatic vessels and valved collecting vessels surrounded by smooth muscle cells (SMCs)). We also show that Lyve-1(Cre) mice display robust Cre activity in macrophages and in blood vessels in the yolk sac, liver and lung. This activity dramatically impairs the development of blood vessels in these tissues in Lyve-1(wt/Cre);Vegfr2(flox/flox) embryos, most of which die after embryonic day14.5. Lastly, we show that inactivation of Vegfr2 in the myeloid lineage does not affect the development of the lymphatic vasculature. Therefore, the abnormal lymphatic phenotype of Lyve-1(wt/Cre);Vegfr2(flox/flox) mice is due to the deletion of Vegfr2 in the lymphatic vasculature not macrophages. Together, this work demonstrates that VEGFR2 directly promotes the expansion of the lymphatic network and further defines the molecular mechanisms controlling the development of the lymphatic vascular system."
https://openalex.org/W2011856045,"Background Cardiac fibrogenesis in the late stage of viral myocarditis causing contractile dysfunction and ventricular dilatation, is a major pathogenic factor for the progression of myocarditis to serious cardiovascular diseases including dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and congestive heart failure (HF). Recent studies indicate that regulatory T cells (Tregs) are involved in the fibrotic process of liver and lung fibosis. However, the role of Tregs in the development of viral myocarditis-caused cardiac fibrosis and their therapeutic potential remains unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings Myocardial fibrosis was induced in BALB/c mice by intraperitoneal injection of Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) assessed by picrosirius red staining and detection of expression levels of collagen I, matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1). Myocardial Treg frequency was down-regulated during the course of viral myocarditis and a negative correlation with the severity of cardiac fibrosis was found. To explore the role of Tregs in CVB-induced cardiac fibrosis, Treg was in vivo depleted by injecting anti-CD25 mAb which resulted in aggravation of cardiac fibrosis. In consistent with that, after adoptive transfer of isolated Tregs into mice, significant amelioration of CVB3-induced cardiac fibrosis was confirmed. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) neutralizing antibodies were used in vivo and in vitro to explore the molecular mechanism of the therapeutic effect of Treg. It was found that administration of anti-IL-10 mAb after Treg transfer abrogated Treg’s treating effect and the inhibition of Treg on collagen production by cardiac fibroblasts was mediated mainly through IL-10. Conclusion/Significance Our data suggested that Tregs have a protective role in the fibrotic process of CVB3-induced cardiac fibrosis via secreting IL-10 and might provide an alternative option for the future treatment of cardiac fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W1976522578,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause a wide range of infections and inflammations in a variety of hosts, such as chronic biofilm associated lung infections in Cystic Fibrosis patients. Phosphate, an essential nutrient, has been recognized as an important signal that affects virulence in P. aeruginosa. In the current study we examined the connection between phosphate regulation and surface motility in P. aeruginosa. We focused on two important genes, pstS, which is involved in phosphate uptake, and phoB, a central regulator that responds to phosphate starvation. We found that a mutant lacking pstS is constantly starved for phosphate and has a hyper swarming phenotype. Phosphate starvation also induced swarming in the wild type. The phoB mutant, on the other hand, did not express phosphate starvation even when phosphate was limited and showed no swarming. A double mutant lacking both genes (pstS and phoB) showed a similar phenotype to the phoB mutant (i.e. no swarming). This highlights the role of phoB in controlling swarming motility under phosphate-depleted conditions. Finally, we were able to demonstrate that PhoB controls swarming by up-regulating the Rhl quorum sensing system in P. aeruginosa, which resulted in hyper production of rhamonlipids: biosurfactants that are known to induce swarming motility."
https://openalex.org/W2030833168,"The HIV-1 accessory protein Nef is an important virulence factor. It associates with cellular membranes and modulates the endocytic machinery and signaling pathways. Nef also increases the proliferation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which are sites for virus assembly and budding in macrophages. The RNA interference (RNAi) pathway proteins Ago2 and GW182 localize to MVBs, suggesting these to be sites for assembly and turnover of the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). While RNAi affects HIV replication, it is not clear if the virus encodes a suppressor activity to overcome this innate host response. Here we show that Nef colocalizes with MVBs and binds Ago2 through two highly conserved Glycine-Tryptophan (GW) motifs, mutations in which abolish Nef binding to Ago2 and reduce virus yield and infectivity. Nef also inhibits the slicing activity of Ago2 and disturbs the sorting of GW182 into exosomes resulting in the suppression of miRNA-induced silencing. Thus, besides its other activities, the HIV-1 Nef protein is also proposed to function as a viral suppressor of RNAi (VSR)."
https://openalex.org/W2070507509,"Several studies in mouse model of invasive aspergillosis (IA) and in healthy donors have shown that different Aspergillus antigens may stimulate different adaptive immune responses. However, the occurrence of Aspergillus-specific T cells have not yet been reported in patients with the disease. In patients with IA, we have investigated during the infection: a) whether and how specific T-cell responses to different Aspergillus antigens occur and develop; b) which antigens elicit the highest frequencies of protective immune responses and, c) whether such protective T cells could be expanded ex-vivo. Forty hematologic patients have been studied, including 22 patients with IA and 18 controls. Specific T cells producing IL-10, IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-17A have been characterized through enzyme linked immunospot and cytokine secretion assays on 88 peripheral blood (PB) samples, by using the following recombinant antigens: GEL1p, CRF1p, PEP1p, SOD1p, α1-3glucan, β1-3glucan, galactomannan. Specific T cells were expanded through short term culture. Aspergillus-specific T cells producing non-protective interleukin-10 (IL-10) and protective interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) have been detected to all the antigens only in IA patients. Lower numbers of specific T cells producing IL-4 and IL-17A have also been shown. Protective T cells targeted predominantly Aspergillus cell wall antigens, tended to increase during the IA course and to be associated with a better clinical outcome. Aspergillus-specific T cells could be successfully generated from the PB of 8 out of 8 patients with IA and included cytotoxic subsets able to lyse Aspergillus hyphae. Aspergillus specific T-cell responses contribute to the clearance of the pathogen in immunosuppressed patients with IA and Aspergillus cell wall antigens are those mainly targeted by protective immune responses. Cytotoxic specific T cells can be expanded from immunosuppressed patients even during the infection by using the above mentioned antigens. These findings may be exploited for immunotherapeutic purposes in patients with IA."
https://openalex.org/W1968786427,"White-nose syndrome (WNS) has claimed the lives of millions of hibernating insectivorous bats in North America. Its etiologic agent, the psychrophilic fungus Geomyces destructans, causes skin lesions that are the hallmark of the disease. The fungal infection is characterized by a white powdery growth on muzzle, ears and wing membranes. While WNS may threaten some species of North American bats with regional extinction, infection in hibernating bats in Europe seems not to be associated with significant mortality. We performed histopathological investigations on biopsy samples of 11 hibernating European bats, originating from 4 different countries, colonized by G. destructans. One additional bat was euthanized to allow thorough examination of multiple strips of its wing membranes. Molecular analyses of touch imprints, swabs and skin samples confirmed that fungal structures were G. destructans. Additionally, archived field notes on hibernacula monitoring data in the Harz Mountains, Germany, over an 11-year period (2000-2011) revealed multiple capture-recapture events of 8 banded bats repeatedly displaying characteristic fungal colonization. Skin lesions of G. destructans-affected hibernating European bats are intriguingly similar to the epidermal lesions described in North American bats. Nevertheless, deep invasion of fungal hyphae into the dermal connective tissue with resulting ulceration like in North American bats was not observed in the biopsy samples of European bats; all lesions found were restricted to the layers of the epidermis and its adnexae. Two bats had mild epidermal cupping erosions as described for North American bats. The possible mechanisms for any difference in outcomes of G. destructans infection in European and North American bats still need to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W2128876042,"Short-term feed deprivation (or fasting) is a common occurrence in aquacultured fish species whether due to season, production strategies, or disease. In channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) fasting impacts susceptibility to several bacterial pathogens including Flavobacterium columnare, the causative agent of columnaris disease. As columnaris gains entry through the gills and skin of fish, we examined here changes in transcriptional regulation induced in these surface mucosal tissues due to short-term (7 day) fasting. RNA-seq expression analysis revealed a total of 1,545 genes perturbed by fasting. Fasting significantly altered expression of critical innate immune factors in a manner consistent with lower immune fitness as well as dysregulating key genes involved in energy metabolism and cell cycling/proliferation. Downregulation of innate immune actors such as iNOS2b, Lysozyme C, and peptidoglycan recognition protein 6 is predicted to impact the delicate recognition/tolerance balance for commensal and pathogenic bacteria on the skin and gill. The highlighted expression profiles reveal potential mechanistic similarities between gut and surface mucosa and underscore the complex interrelationships between nutrition, mucosal integrity, and immunity in teleost fish."
https://openalex.org/W2002876239,"To identify genes implicated in metastatic colonization of the liver in colorectal cancer, we collected pairs of primary tumors and hepatic metastases before chemotherapy in 13 patients. We compared mRNA expression in the pairs of patients to identify genes deregulated during metastatic evolution. We then validated the identified genes using data obtained by different groups. The 33-gene signature was able to classify 87% of hepatic metastases, 98% of primary tumors, 97% of normal colon mucosa, and 95% of normal liver tissues in six datasets obtained using five different microarray platforms. The identified genes are specific to colon cancer and hepatic metastases since other metastatic locations and hepatic metastases originating from breast cancer were not classified by the signature. Gene Ontology term analysis showed that 50% of the genes are implicated in extracellular matrix remodeling, and more precisely in cell adhesion, extracellular matrix organization and angiogenesis. Because of the high efficiency of the signature to classify colon hepatic metastases, the identified genes represent promising targets to develop new therapies that will specifically affect hepatic metastasis microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2093386657,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses a type III secretion system to introduce the adenylyl and guanylyl cyclase exotoxin Y (ExoY) into the cytoplasm of endothelial cells. ExoY induces Tau hyperphosphorylation and insolubility, microtubule breakdown, barrier disruption and edema, although the mechanism(s) responsible for microtubule breakdown remain poorly understood. Here we investigated both microtubule behavior and centrosome activity to test the hypothesis that ExoY disrupts microtubule dynamics. Fluorescence microscopy determined that infected pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells contained fewer microtubules than control cells, and further studies demonstrated that the microtubule-associated protein Tau was hyperphosphorylated following infection and dissociated from microtubules. Disassembly/reassembly studies determined that microtubule assembly was disrupted in infected cells, with no detectable effects on either microtubule disassembly or microtubule nucleation by centrosomes. This effect of ExoY on microtubules was abolished when the cAMP-dependent kinase phosphorylation site (Ser-214) on Tau was mutated to a non-phosphorylatable form. These studies identify Tau in microvascular endothelial cells as the target of ExoY in control of microtubule architecture following pulmonary infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and demonstrate that phosphorylation of tau following infection decreases microtubule assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2146767526,"This work explores the impact of knots, knot depth and motif of the threading terminus in protein folding properties (kinetics, thermodynamics and mechanism) via extensive Monte Carlo simulations of lattice models. A knotted backbone has no effect on protein thermodynamic stability but it may affect key aspects of folding kinetics. In this regard, we found clear evidence for a functional advantage of knots: knots enhance kinetic stability because a knotted protein unfolds at a distinctively slower rate than its unknotted counterpart. However, an increase in knot deepness does not necessarily lead to more effective changes in folding properties. In this regard, a terminus with a non-trivial conformation (e.g. hairpin) can have a more dramatic effect in enhancing kinetic stability than knot depth. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the probability of the denatured ensemble to keep knotted is higher for proteins with deeper knots, indicating that knot depth plays a role in determining the topology of the denatured state. Refolding simulations starting from denatured knotted conformations show that not every knot is able to nucleate folding and further indicate that the formation of the knotting loop is a key event in the folding of knotted trefoils. They also show that there are specific native contacts within the knotted core that are crucial to keep a native knotting loop in denatured conformations which otherwise have no detectable structure. The study of the knotting mechanism reveals that the threading of the knotting loop generally occurs towards late folding in conformations that exhibit a significant degree of structural consolidation."
https://openalex.org/W2035629974,"The decline in ocean water pH and changes in carbonate saturation states through anthropogenically mediated increases in atmospheric CO2 levels may pose a hazard to marine organisms. This may be particularly acute for those species reliant on calcareous structures like shells and exoskeletons. This is of particular concern in the case of valuable commercially exploited species such as the king scallop, Pecten maximus. In this study we investigated the effects on oxygen consumption, clearance rates and cellular turnover in juvenile P. maximus following 3 months laboratory exposure to four pCO2 treatments (290, 380, 750 and 1140 µatm). None of the exposure levels were found to have significant effect on the clearance rates, respiration rates, condition index or cellular turnover (RNA: DNA) of individuals. While it is clear that some life stages of marine bivalves appear susceptible to future levels of ocean acidification, particularly under food limiting conditions, the results from this study suggest that where food is in abundance, bivalves like juvenile P. maximus may display a tolerance to limited changes in seawater chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W1984693806,"The examination of telomere dynamics is a recent technique in ecology for assessing physiological state and age-related traits from individuals of unknown age. Telomeres shorten with age in most species and are expected to reflect physiological state, reproductive investment, and chronological age. Loss of telomere length is used as an indicator of biological aging, as this detrimental deterioration is associated with lowered survival. Lifespan dimorphism and more rapid senescence in the larger, shorter-lived sex are predicted in species with sexual size dimorphism, however, little is known about the effects of behavioral dimorphism on senescence and life history traits in species with sexual monomorphism. Here we compare telomere dynamics of thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia), a species with male-biased parental care, in two ways: 1) cross-sectionally in birds of known-age (0-28 years) from one colony and 2) longitudinally in birds from four colonies. Telomere dynamics are compared using three measures: the telomere restriction fragment (TRF), a lower window of TRF (TOE), and qPCR. All showed age-related shortening of telomeres, but the TRF measure also indicated that adult female murres have shorter telomere length than adult males, consistent with sex-specific patterns of ageing. Adult males had longer telomeres than adult females on all colonies examined, but chick telomere length did not differ by sex. Additionally, inter-annual telomere changes may be related to environmental conditions; birds from a potentially low quality colony lost telomeres, while those at more hospitable colonies maintained telomere length. We conclude that sex-specific patterns of telomere loss exist in the sexually monomorphic thick-billed murre but are likely to occur between fledging and recruitment. Longer telomeres in males may be related to their homogamous sex chromosomes (ZZ) or to selection for longer life in the care-giving sex. Environmental conditions appeared to be the primary drivers of annual changes in adult birds."

The life cycle of Toxoplasma gondii is complex, with multiple proliferation and differentiation steps, of which tachyzoite proliferation is the most relevant to pathogenesis in humans and animals. Tachyzoites express invasion and virulence factors that are crucial for their survival and manipulation of host cell functions. The expression of those factors is tightly controlled during the tachyzoite cell cycle to permit their correct packaging in newly formed apical secretory organelles named micronemes and rhoptries in the daughter cells.

https://openalex.org/W2099180149,"Background Steviol glycoside biosynthesis pathway has emerged as bifurcation from ent-kaurenoic acid, substrate of methyl erythritol phosphate pathway that also leads to gibberellin biosynthesis. However, the genetic regulation of steviol glycoside biosynthesis has not been studied. So, in present study RNA interference (RNAi) based Agrobacterium mediated transient gene silencing (AMTS) approach was followed. SrKA13H and three SrUGTs (SrUGT85C2, SrUGT74G1 and SrUGT76G1) genes encoding ent-kaurenoic acid-13 hydroxylase and three UDP glycosyltransferases of steviol glycoside biosynthesis pathway were silenced in Stevia rebaudiana to understand its molecular mechanism and association with gibberellins. Methodology/Principal Findings RNAi mediated AMTS of SrKA13H and three SrUGTs has significantly reduced the expression of targeted endogenous genes as well as total steviol glycoside accumulation. While gibberellins (GA3) content was significantly enhanced on AMTS of SrUGT85C2 and SrKA13H. Silencing of SrKA13H and SrUGT85C2 was found to block the metabolite flux of steviol glycoside pathway and shifted it towards GA3 biosynthesis. Further, molecular docking of three SrUGT proteins has documented highest affinity of SrUGT76G1 for the substrates of alternate pathways synthesizing steviol glycosides. This could be a plausible reason for maximum reduction in steviol glycoside content on silencing of SrUGT76G1 than other genes. Conclusions SrKA13H and SrUGT85C2 were identified as regulatory genes influencing carbon flux between steviol glycoside and gibberellin biosynthesis. This study has also documented the existence of alternate steviol glycoside biosynthesis route."
https://openalex.org/W1981580786,"Domestication can influence many functional traits in plants, from overall life-history and growth form to wood density and cell wall ultrastructure. Such changes can increase fitness of the domesticate in agricultural environments but may negatively affect survival in the wild. We studied effects of domestication on stem biomechanics in manioc by comparing domesticated and ancestral wild taxa from two different regions of greater Amazonia. We compared mechanical properties, tissue organisation and wood characteristics including microfibril angles in both wild and domesticated plants, each growing in two different habitats (forest or savannah) and varying in growth form (shrub or liana). Wild taxa grew as shrubs in open savannah but as lianas in overgrown and forested habitats. Growth form plasticity was retained in domesticated manioc. However, stems of the domesticate showed brittle failure. Wild plants differed in mechanical architecture between shrub and liana phenotypes, a difference that diminished between shrubs and lianas of the domesticate. Stems of wild plants were generally stiffer, failed at higher bending stresses and were less prone to brittle fracture compared with shrub and liana phenotypes of the domesticate. Biomechanical differences between stems of wild and domesticated plants were mainly due to changes in wood density and cellulose microfibril angle rather than changes in secondary growth or tissue geometry. Domestication did not significantly modify “large-scale” trait development or growth form plasticity, since both wild and domesticated manioc can develop as shrubs or lianas. However, “finer-scale” developmental traits crucial to mechanical stability and thus ecological success of the plant were significantly modified. This profoundly influenced the likelihood of brittle failure, particularly in long climbing stems, thereby also influencing the survival of the domesticate in natural situations vulnerable to mechanical perturbation. We discuss the different selective pressures that could explain evolutionary modifications of stem biomechanical properties under domestication in manioc."
https://openalex.org/W2018525013,"Intracranial aneurysm initiation is poorly understood, although hemodynamic insult is believed to play an important role in triggering the pathology. It has recently been found in a rabbit model that while macrophages are absent during hemodynamic aneurysm initiation, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are elevated and co-localize with smooth muscle cells (SMCs). This study investigates whether SMCs play a mechanistic role in aneurysm initiation triggered by hemodynamics.Aneurysmal damage was induced at the basilar terminus via bilateral common carotid artery ligation in rabbits (n = 45, plus 7 sham controls). 16 ligated rabbits were treated with doxycycline to inhibit MMPs, 7 received clodronate liposomes to deplete circulating monocytes, and the rest received no drug. Effects of the treatments on aneurysm development were assessed histologically 5 days and 6 months after ligation. MMP production and expression of inflammatory markers by SMCs was monitored by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization.Treatment with doxycycline attenuated aneurysmal development examined at 5 days and 6 months, suggesting that MMPs contribute to aneurysm initiation. However, systemic depletion of macrophages did not decrease MMPs or suppress aneurysmal development. Immunofluorescence showed that during aneurysm initiation MMP-2 and MMP-9 were distributed in SMCs, and in situ hybridization indicated that they were transcribed by SMCs. In regions of early aneurysmal lesion, SMCs exhibited decreased expression of smooth muscle actin and increased NF-κB and MCP-1 expressions.During aneurysm initiation triggered by hemodynamics, SMCs rather than macrophages are responsible for MMP production that is critical for aneurysmal lesion development. These SMCs exhibit proinflammatory behavior."

The inhibitory effect of three 2-bromo-fatty acids of 2-bromohexanoic acid (2-BrHA), 2-bromooctanoic acid (2-BrOA) and 2-bromodecanoic acid (2-BrDA) was compared to get an insight into the biochemical nature of their probable dual inhibition against the two enzymes. The 2-bromo-compounds were found to inhibit rhamnolipid and PHA synthesis simultaneously in alkyl-chain-length dependent manner at several millimolar concentrations. The separate and dual inhibition of the RhlA and PhaG pathway by the 2-bromo-compounds in the wild-type cells was verified by investigating their inhibitory effects on the rhamnolipid and PHA synthesis in P. aeruginosa ΔphaG and ΔrhlA mutants. Unexpectedly, the order of inhibition strength was found 2-BrHA (≥90% at 2 mM) > 2-BrOA > 2-BrDA, equally for all of the rhamnolipids and PHA synthesis, swarming motility and biofilm formation. We suggest that the novel strongest inhibitor 2-BrHA could be potentially exploited to control the rhamnolipid-associated group behaviors of this pathogen as well as for its utilization as a lead compound in screening for antimicrobial agents based on new antimicrobial targets."
https://openalex.org/W2080999327,"Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is caused by a homozygous GAA repeat expansion mutation within intron 1 of the FXN gene, which induces epigenetic changes and FXN gene silencing. Bisulfite sequencing studies have identified 5-methylcytosine (5 mC) DNA methylation as one of the epigenetic changes that may be involved in this process. However, analysis of samples by bisulfite sequencing is a time-consuming procedure. In addition, it has recently been shown that 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5 hmC) is also present in mammalian DNA, and bisulfite sequencing cannot distinguish between 5 hmC and 5 mC.We have developed specific MethylScreen restriction enzyme digestion and qPCR-based protocols to more rapidly quantify DNA methylation at four CpG sites in the FXN upstream GAA region. Increased DNA methylation was confirmed at all four CpG sites in both FRDA cerebellum and heart tissues. We have also analysed the DNA methylation status in FRDA cerebellum and heart tissues using an approach that enables distinction between 5 hmC and 5 mC. Our analysis reveals that the majority of DNA methylation in both FRDA and unaffected tissues actually comprises 5 hmC rather than 5 mC. We have also identified decreased occupancy of the chromatin insulator protein CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) at the FXN 5' UTR region in the same FRDA cerebellum tissues.Increased DNA methylation at the FXN upstream GAA region, primarily 5 hmC rather than 5 mC, and decreased CTCF occupancy at the FXN 5' UTR are associated with FRDA disease-relevant human tissues. The role of such molecular mechanisms in FRDA pathogenesis has now to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2012769450,"Artificial structures can create novel habitat in the marine environment that has been associated with the spread of invasive species. They are often located in areas of high disturbance and can vary significantly in the area of free space provided for settlement of marine organisms. Whilst correlation between the amount of free space available and recruitment success has been shown in populations of several marine benthic organisms, there has been relatively little focus on invasive species, a group with the potential to reproduce in vast numbers and colonise habitats rapidly. Invasion success following different scales of disturbance was examined in the invasive acorn barnacle, Austrominiusmodestus, on a unique art installation located in Liverpool Bay. Population growth and recruitment success were examined by comparing recruitment rates within disturbance clearings of 4 different sizes and by contrasting population development with early recruitment rates over a 10 week period. Disturbed areas were rapidly recolonised and monocultures of A. modestus formed within 6 weeks. The size of patch created during disturbance had no effect on the rate of recruitment, while a linear relationship between recruit density and patch size was observed. Density-dependent processes mediated initial high recruitment resulting in population stability after 8-10 weeks, but densities continued to greatly exceed those reported in natural habitats. Given that artificial structures are likely to continue to proliferate in light of climate change projections, free-space is likely to become more available more frequently in the future supporting the expansion of fast-colonising species."
https://openalex.org/W1971195826,"It is of significant interest to understand how proteins interact, which holds the key phenomenon in biological functions. Using dynamic fluctuations in high frequency modes, we show that the Gaussian Network Model (GNM) predicts hot spot residues with success rates ranging between S 8–58%, C 84–95%, P 5–19% and A 81–92% on unbound structures and S 8–51%, C 97–99%, P 14–50%, A 94–97% on complex structures for sensitivity, specificity, precision and accuracy, respectively. High specificity and accuracy rates with a single property on unbound protein structures suggest that hot spots are predefined in the dynamics of unbound structures and forming the binding core of interfaces, whereas the prediction of other functional residues with similar dynamic behavior explains the lower precision values. The latter is demonstrated with the case studies; ubiquitin, hen egg-white lysozyme and M2 proton channel. The dynamic fluctuations suggest a pseudo network of residues with high frequency fluctuations, which could be plausible for the mechanism of biological interactions and allosteric regulation."

Early diagnosis is essential for rapid clinical treatment to avoid misdiagnosis and severe patient outcomes. Simple, sensitive and reliable diagnostic methods are urgently needed. In this study, we developed a duplex real-time PCR assay targeting the A. phagocytophilum ankA gene and the E. chaffeensis TRP120 gene, respectively. The lowest limit of detection of the duplex real-time PCR assay was 100 copies of the targeted A. phagocytophilum ankA gene and the E. chaffeensis TRP120 gene per reaction, and the specificity was 100%. Detection in blood DNA samples from the acute stage of illness for 22 HGA cases and 8 HME cases indicated that the duplex real-time PCR assay was more sensitive than the nested PCR assay. The infection of Citellus undulatus Pallas with A. phagocytophilum and E. chaffeensis was first confirmed in Xinjiang Province and the positive rate was 3.1% for A. phagocytophilum, 6.3% for E. chaffeensis and 3.1% for co-infection with both pathogens. The rates of A. phagocytophilum and E. chaffeensis infection of D. silvarum ticks collected from Shanxi Province were 8.2% and 14.8%, respectively, and the co-infection rate was 3.3%.

https://openalex.org/W2070534928,"It has been shown that healthy aging affects the ability to focus attention on a given task and to ignore distractors. Here, we asked whether long-term physical activity is associated with lower susceptibility to distraction of auditory attention, and how physically active and inactive seniors may differ regarding subcomponents of auditory attention. An auditory duration discrimination task was employed, and involuntary attentional shifts to task-irrelevant rare frequency deviations and subsequent reorientation were studied by analysis of behavioral data and event-related potential measures. The frequency deviations impaired performance more in physically inactive than active seniors. This was accompanied by a stronger frontal positivity (P3a) and increased activation of anterior cingulate cortex, suggesting a stronger involuntary shift of attention towards task-irrelevant stimulus features in inactive compared to active seniors. These results indicate a positive relationship between physical fitness and attentional control in elderly, presumably due to more focused attentional resources and enhanced inhibition of irrelevant stimulus features."
https://openalex.org/W2021797754,"Quality assessment (QA) for predicted protein structural models is an important and challenging research problem in protein structure prediction. Consensus Global Distance Test (CGDT) methods assess each decoy (predicted structural model) based on its structural similarity to all others in a decoy set and has been proved to work well when good decoys are in a majority cluster. Scoring functions evaluate each single decoy based on its structural properties. Both methods have their merits and limitations. In this paper, we present a novel method called PWCom, which consists of two neural networks sequentially to combine CGDT and single model scoring methods such as RW, DDFire and OPUS-Ca. Specifically, for every pair of decoys, the difference of the corresponding feature vectors is input to the first neural network which enables one to predict whether the decoy-pair are significantly different in terms of their GDT scores to the native. If yes, the second neural network is used to decide which one of the two is closer to the native structure. The quality score for each decoy in the pool is based on the number of winning times during the pairwise comparisons. Test results on three benchmark datasets from different model generation methods showed that PWCom significantly improves over consensus GDT and single scoring methods. The QA server (MUFOLD-Server) applying this method in CASP 10 QA category was ranked the second place in terms of Pearson and Spearman correlation performance."
https://openalex.org/W1990555300,"In glacier-fed systems climate change may have various effects over a range of time scales, including increasing river discharge, flood frequency and magnitude. This study uses a combination of empirical monitoring and modelling to project the impacts of climate change on the glacial-fed Middle Fork Toklat River, Denali National Park, Alaska. We use a regional calibration of the model HBV to account for a paucity of long term observed flow data, validating a local application using glacial mass balance data and summer flow records. Two Global Climate Models (HADCM3 and CGCM2) and two IPCC scenarios (A2 and B2) are used to ascertain potential changes in meteorological conditions, river discharge, flood frequency and flood magnitude. Using remote sensing methods this study refines existing estimates of glacial recession rates, finding that since 2000, rates have increased from 24m per year to 68.5m per year, with associated increases in ablation zone ice loss. GCM projections indicate that over the 21st century these rates will increase still further, most extensively under the CGCM2 model, and A2 scenarios. Due to greater winter precipitation and ice and snow accumulation, glaciers release increasing meltwater quantities throughout the 21st century. Despite increases in glacial melt, results indicate that it is predominantly precipitation that affects river discharge. Three of the four IPCC scenarios project increases in flood frequency and magnitude, events which were primarily associated with changing precipitation patterns, rather than extreme temperature increases or meltwater release. Results suggest that although increasing temperatures will significantly increase glacial melt and winter baseflow, meltwater alone does not pose a significant flood hazard to the Toklat River catchment. Projected changes in precipitation are the primary concern, both through changing snow volumes available for melt, and more directly through increasing catchment runoff."

We hypothesized that immunizing rabbits with viral envelope glycoproteins (Envs) from these patients may induce bNAbs, when formulated as a trimeric protein and in the presence of an adjuvant.Based on in vitro neutralizing activity in serum, patients with bNAbs were selected for cloning of their HIV-1 Env. Seven stable soluble trimeric gp140 proteins were generated from sequences derived from four adults and two children infected with either clade A or B HIV-1. From one of the clade A Envs both the monomeric and trimeric Env were produced for comparison. Rabbits were immunized with soluble gp120 or trimeric gp140 proteins in combination with the adjuvant dimethyl dioctadecyl ammonium/trehalose dibehenate (CAF01). Env binding in rabbit immune serum was determined using ELISAs based on gp120-IIIB protein. Neutralizing activity of IgG purified from rabbit immune sera was measured with the pseudovirus-TZMbl assay and a PBMC-based neutralization assay for selected experiments.It was initially established that gp140 trimers induce better antibody responses over gp120 monomers and that the adjuvant CAF01 was necessary for such strong responses. Gp140 trimers, based on HIV-1 variants from patients with bNAbs, were able to elicit both gp120IIIB specific IgG and NAbs to Tier 1 viruses of different subtypes. Potency of NAbs closely correlated with titers, and an gp120-binding IgG titer above a threshold of 100,000 was predictive of neutralization capability. Finally, peptide inhibition experiments showed that a large fraction of the neutralizing IgG was directed against the gp120 V3 region.Our results indicate that the strategy of reverse immunology based on selected Env sequences is promising when immunogens are delivered as stabilized trimers in CAF01 adjuvant and that the rabbit is a valuable model for HIV vaccine studies."

Its abundance is ∼0.1% of the total protein in the red cell membrane, although it is much more abundant in some specialized cells. Unfortunately, these latter cells are not available in quantity, hampering efforts to produce suitable crystals for x-ray structure analysis. Although PMCA could not yet be crystallized, insight into the structural organization of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), a member of the same family, has come from the elucidation of several crystal structures at atomic resolution, representing the pump in various intermediate states (see Refs. 2.Toyoshima C.

The membrane-buried region of SERCA is made up of 10 membrane-spanning helices and is connected to a large cytoplasmic headpiece, which is further separated into three distinct domains, denoted A (“actuator”), P (“phosphorylation”), and N (“nucleotide binding”). However, unlike SERCA, PMCA is highly regulated by calmodulin, which activates this protein by binding to an autoinhibitory region (4.Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Földes-Papp Z. Gárdos G.

The current kinetic model for the PMCA proposes that the enzyme exists in two main conformations, E1 and E2. E1 has a high affinity for Ca2+ and is readily phosphorylated by ATP, whereas E2 has a low affinity for Ca2+ and can be phosphorylated by Pi. After binding of intracellular Ca2+ to high affinity sites, E1 can be phosphorylated by ATP with formation of the intermediate E1P. A subsequent conformational transition to E2P would allow Ca2+ to be released to the extracellular medium from low affinity sites, followed by the hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme to E2 and a new conformational transition to E1 (7.Rega A.F. Garrahan P.J. The Ca2+ Pump of Plasma Membranes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1986: 115-125Google Scholar). During some stages of the reaction cycle, Ca2+ becomes occluded (i.e. trapped in the enzyme machinery) while it is transported from one side to the other side of the membrane (8.Ferreira-Gomes M.S.

It has been described that in addition to being the substrate in the phosphorylation of the E1Ca state, ATP also functions in a non-phosphorylating mode by enhancing the rates of the steps involved in phosphoenzyme turnover (E1PCa → E2P and E2P → E2) as well as the E2 → E1Ca transition of the dephosphoenzyme (9.Scofano H.M.

Modulatory ATP binding affinity in intermediate states of E2P dephosphorylation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 11792-11802Google Scholar). In PMCA, the mechanisms underlying these modulatory effects of ATP remain largely unresolved. By using [125I]TID-PC/16, we were previously able to assess different transmembrane conformations in PMCA: a first one in which the protein displays maximum lipid exposure corresponding to an autoinhibited state of the enzyme (E1CaI, in the presence of Ca2+ alone, hereafter denoted as E1Ca), a second one in which protein-lipid interactions are markedly decreased corresponding to an activated state (E1CaA, presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin), and a third one in the absence of Ca2+ (E2) (21.Mangialavori I. Villamil Giraldo A.M. Marino Buslje C. Ferreira Gomes M. Caride A.J. Rossi J.P. A new conformation in sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump and plasma membrane Ca2+ pumps revealed by a photoactivatable phospholipidic probe.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4823-4828Google Scholar). Using the same experimental approach, we were also able to measure equilibrium constants for different ligands through the change of transmembrane conformations in PMCA (22.Mangialavori I.C. Ferreira-Gomes M. Pignataro M.F. Strehler E.E. Rossi J.P. Determination of the dissociation constants for Ca2+ and calmodulin from the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump by a lipid probe that senses membrane domain changes.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 123-130Google Scholar). In order to obtain a complete understanding of the physical processes that involve ATP hydrolysis and Ca2+ transport, it is necessary to know more about the structure of the enzyme. The above results highlight the convenience of directly exploring the effects of different ligands on the PMCA transmembrane region. Applying this technique to PMCA, we were able to measure equilibrium constants for the dissociation of ligands from PMCA complexes and to draw structural conclusions about the regulation of the transport of Ca2+ in the presence of different ligands, such as ATP and vanadate, a well known inhibitor of P-ATPases, which forms a complex analogous to the phosphorylated intermediate E2P. Conformational movement of the ATP binding domain was determined using the fluorescent analog TNP-ATP. To assess the conformational behavior of the Ca2+ domain, we also studied the occlusion of Ca2+ in experimental conditions that lead the PMCA to different intermediates of the reaction cycle. All chemicals used in this work were of analytical grade and purchased mostly from Sigma. Recently drawn human blood for the isolation of PMCA was obtained from the Hematology Section of Fundacion Fundosol (Argentina). Blood donation in Argentina is voluntary, and therefore the donor provides informed consent for the donation of blood and for the subsequent legitimate use of the blood by the transfusion service. None of the experiments described in this paper included calmodulin in the incubation media, and therefore, all results refer to the autoinhibited form of the PMCA. PMCA was isolated from calmodulin-depleted erythrocyte membranes by the calmodulin affinity chromatography procedure (23.Niggli V. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. Purification of the (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase from human erythrocyte membranes using a calmodulin affinity column.J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9955-9958Google Scholar). Protein concentration after purification was about 10 μg/ml. No phospholipids were added at any step along the purification procedure. The purification procedure described preserves transport activity and the kinetic properties and regulatory characteristics of the enzyme in its native milieu (23.Niggli V. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. Purification of the (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase from human erythrocyte membranes using a calmodulin affinity column.J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9955-9958Google Scholar, 24.Filomatori C.V. Rega A.F. On the mechanism of activation of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase by ATP and acidic phospholipids.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22265-22271Google Scholar). Ca2+-ATPase activity was measured at 37 °C as the initial velocity of release of Pi from ATP, as described previously (7.Rega A.F. Garrahan P.J. The Ca2+ Pump of Plasma Membranes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1986: 115-125Google Scholar). The incubation medium contained 40 μm DMPC, 120 μm C12E10, 120 mm KCl, 30 mm MOPS-K (pH 7.4 at 37 °C), 2 mm ATP, 3.75 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, and enough CaCl2 to give 100 μm final free [Ca2+]. When necessary, sodium orthovanadate ((VO4)3−, also named vanadate hereafter) or lanthanum chloride (LaIII) was added at the concentrations indicated in the figures. Release of Pi was estimated according to the procedure of Fiske and SubbaRow (25.Fiske C.H. SubbaRow Y. The colorimetric determination of phosphorus.J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Google Scholar). Measurements were performed in a Jasco V-630 Bio spectrophotometer. The phosphorylated intermediates (EP) were measured as the amount of acid-stable 32P incorporated into the enzyme (0.9 μg/ml), according to the method described by Echarte et al. (26.Echarte M.M. Levi V. Villamil A.M. Rossi R.C. Rossi J.P. Quantitation of plasma membrane calcium pump phosphorylated intermediates by electrophoresis.Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 267-273Google Scholar). The phosphorylation was measured at 4 °C in a medium containing 30 mm MOPS-K (pH 7.4 at 4 °C), 120 mm KCl, 3.75 mm MgCl2, 120 μm C12E10, 40 μm DMPC, 2 mm EGTA, 30 μm [γ-32P]ATP, and enough CaCl2 to obtain 100 μm final free [Ca2+]. The reaction was started by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP under vigorous stirring, and after 1 min, it was stopped with an ice-cold solution of TCA (10% (w/v) final concentration). The tubes were centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 3.5 min at 4 °C. The samples were then washed once with 7% TCA, 150 mm H3PO4 and once with double-distilled water and processed for SDS-PAGE. For this purpose, the pellets were dissolved in a medium containing 150 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.5 at 14 °C), 5% SDS, 5% DTT, 10% glycerol, and bromphenol blue (sample buffer). Electrophoresis was performed at pH 6.3 (14 °C) in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. The reservoir buffer was 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.3, with 0.1% SDS. Migration of the sample components took place at 14 °C, with a current of 60 mA until the tracking dye reached a distance of about 10 cm from the top of the gel. Gels were stained, dried, and exposed to a Storage Phospho Screen (Amersham Biosciences). Unsaturated autoradiograms and stained gels were scanned with an HP Scanjet G2410 scanner. Analysis of the images was performed with GelPro Analyzer. EP quantification was achieved as described by Echarte et al. (26.Echarte M.M. Levi V. Villamil A.M. Rossi R.C. Rossi J.P. Quantitation of plasma membrane calcium pump phosphorylated intermediates by electrophoresis.Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 267-273Google Scholar). TTD-PC/16 (tin precursor) was a kind gift of Dr. J. Brunner (ETH Zentrum, Zurich, Switzerland). [125I]TID-PC/16 was prepared by radioiodination of its tin precursor according to Weber and Brunner (27.Durrer P. Gaudin Y. Ruigrok R.W. Graf R. Brunner J. Photolabeling identifies a putative fusion domain in the envelope glycoprotein of rabies and vesicular stomatitis viruses.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17575-17581Google Scholar). A photolabeling assay was carried out as described by Mangialavori et al. (21.Mangialavori I. Villamil Giraldo A.M. Marino Buslje C. Ferreira Gomes M. Caride A.J. Rossi J.P. A new conformation in sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump and plasma membrane Ca2+ pumps revealed by a photoactivatable phospholipidic probe.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4823-4828Google Scholar, 22.Mangialavori I.C. Ferreira-Gomes M. Pignataro M.F. Strehler E.E. Rossi J.P. Determination of the dissociation constants for Ca2+ and calmodulin from the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump by a lipid probe that senses membrane domain changes.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 123-130Google Scholar). A dried film of the photoactivatable reagent was suspended in PC/C12E10 mixed micelles containing 10 μg/ml of the membrane protein. The samples were incubated in the presence of necessary components for 10 min at 25 °C before being irradiated for 10 min with light from a filtered UV source (λ = 360 nm). Electrophoresis was performed according to the Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE method (28.Schägger H. von Jagow G. Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the separation of proteins in the range from 1 to 100 kDa.Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar). Polypeptides were stained with Coomassie Blue R; the isolated bands were excised from the gel, and the incorporation of radioactivity was directly measured on a γ-counter. The amount of protein was quantified by eluting each stained band, as described previously (29.Ball E.H. Quantitation of proteins by elution of Coomassie Brilliant Blue R from stained bands after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 23-27Google Scholar), including bovine serum albumin in each gel as a standard for protein quantification. Specific incorporation was calculated as the ratio between the measured radioactivity and the amount of protein determined for each band. In all cases, a sample in the presence of 2 mm EGTA was included as a control and was taken as 100% of the specific incorporation. This condition was included in the figures only when it was necessary for the result analysis. The procedure for measuring the occlusion of Ca2+ in microsomes containing PMCA involves a system for overexpression of the PMCA and the use of a rapid mixing device combined with a filtration chamber, allowing the isolation of the enzyme and quantification of calcium occluded (8.Ferreira-Gomes M.S. González-Lebrero R. de la Fuente M.C. Strehler E.E. Rossi R.C. Rossi J.P. Calcium occlusion in plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 32018-32025Google Scholar, 30.Rossi R.C. Kaufman S.B. González-Lebrero R.M. Nørby J.G. Garrahan P.J. An attachment for nondestructive, fast quenching of samples in rapid-mixing experiments.Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 276-285Google Scholar). In a typical experiment, one volume of a microsomal preparation suspended in a solution with 30 mm MOPS-K (pH 7.4 at 25 °C), 120 mm KCl, and 400 nm thapsigargin was mixed with the same volume of a solution containing the same concentrations of MOPS-K and KCl plus 3.75 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and enough [45Ca2+]CaCl2 to obtain the concentrations of free Ca2+ indicated in the figures. For some experiments, either 50 μm (VO4)3− or 50 μm LaIII (in this case, to minimize the possibility of precipitation with LaIII, ATP was 25 μm instead of 2 mm) was also included in the latter solution. Measurements were carried out in equilibrium conditions at 25 °C. To ensure the achievement of equilibrium, a reaction time of 3 s was selected after measuring the time courses of occluded calcium in different incubation media. Reactions were quenched by injecting the reaction mixture into the filtration chamber (quenching and washing chamber) at a flow rate of 1–5 ml/s. During the injection process, the fluid was mixed with an ice-cold washing solution flowing at a rate of 30–40 ml/s and then filtered through a Millipore filter (AA, 0.8-μm pore size) placed in the quenching and washing chamber in order to retain the microsomal suspension that included the enzyme. To ensure that the initial temperature in the quenching and washing chamber was 1–2 °C and that the flow was constant, about 50 ml of washing solution was allowed to run through the filter prior to the injection of the reaction mixture, and 240 ml of washing solution was applied to the filter thereafter. The composition of the washing solution was 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4 at 2 °C) and 10 mm EDTA. After the washing solution was drained, the filter was removed, dried under a lamp, and counted for 45Ca2+ radioactivity in a scintillation counter. This was converted into nmol of Ca2+ using the specific activity value of the 45Ca2+ in the reaction mixture. Ca2+ occluded was considered equal to the 45Ca2+ radioactivity retained by the enzyme after subtracting the blank values. These were estimated from the amount of 45Ca2+ retained by the filters in the presence of enzyme that was heat-inactivated for 2 h at 50 °C. The fluorescence measurements were made in a quartz cell of 3 × 3 mm using an SLM- spectrofluorometer AMINCO BOWMAN Series 2 (Spectronic Instrument Inc., Rochester, NY). The excitation and emission bandwidths were set at 4 nm. Purified PMCA (10 μg/ml) was reconstituted in a medium containing 40 μm DMPC, 120 μm C12E10, 120 mm KCl, 30 mm MOPS-K (pH 7.4 at 25 °C), 1 mm MgCl2 and then incubated with one of the following components for 10 min at 25 °C: (i) 2 mm EGTA, (ii) 100 μm free Ca2+, (iii) 2 mm EGTA plus 50 μm (VO4)3−, or (iv) 100 μm free Ca2+ plus 50 μm (VO4)3−. After incubation, increasing concentrations of TNP-ATP were added to each condition as described previously by Qu et al. (31.Qu Q. Russell P.L. Sharom F.J. Stoichiometry and affinity of nucleotide binding to P-glycoprotein during the catalytic cycle.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1170-1177Google Scholar). The fluorescence emission was measured at 539 nm after excitation at 495 nm and corrected for light scattering by background subtraction. An aliquot of the same solution without protein was titrated as a control in all experiments. In this case, the fluorescence emission behavior of TNP-ATP was linear and less than 15% of the fluorescence emission in the presence of protein. As described previously by Pérez-Gordones et al. (32.Pérez-Gordones M.C. Lugo M.R. Winkler M. Cervino V. Benaim G. Diacylglycerol regulates the plasma membrane calcium pump from human erythrocytes by direct interaction.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2009; 489: 55-61Google Scholar), in the presence of calcium, no hydrolysis was observed of TNP-ATP. As was reported for other ATPases (33.Lin S.H. Faller L.D.

The ASAs of two crystal structures of SERCA were compared as an approach to analyze the changes in incorporation of [125I]TID-PC/16 in the PMCA intermediates E1Ca and E1PCa. The crystal structures used for comparison were those of E1·2Ca (Protein Data Bank code 1su4) (38.Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Crystal structure of the calcium pump of sarcoplasmic reticulum at 2.6 Å resolution.Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Google Scholar) and Ca2E1P (Protein Data Bank code 3ba6) (39.Olesen C. Picard M.

The transmembrane regions were taken as explicitly defined in Uniprot for sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2, accession number P20647.

Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Google Scholar) with a solvent radius of 1.4 Å. Theoretical equations were fitted to the results by nonlinear regression based on the Gauss-Newton algorithm using commercial programs (Excel and Sigma-Plot for Windows, the latter providing not only the best fitting values of the parameters but also their S.E.). The goodness of fit of a given equation to the experimental results was evaluated by the corrected AIC criterion (42.Burnham K.P. Anderson D.R. Model Selection and Multimodel Inference. 2nd Ed. Springer, New York2002: 60-85Google Scholar) defined as AICC = N ln(SS/N) + 2P N/(N − P − 1), where N is the number of data, P is the number of parameters plus one, and SS is the sum of weighted square residual errors. Unitary weights were considered in all cases, and the best equation was chosen as that giving the lower value of AICC. The AIC criterion is based on information theory and selects an equation among several possible equations on the basis of its capacity to explain the results using a minimal number of parameters. Ca2+-ATPase activity of purified PMCA was measured in the presence of 100 μm free Ca2+ and increasing concentrations of vanadate (Fig. 1A) or LaIII (Fig. 1B). Equation 1 was fitted to the experimental data (continuous lines), v=V0KlKl+[l](Eq. 1) where [I] is the concentration of inhibitor (either (VO4)3− or LaIII), V0 is the Ca2+-ATPase activity in the absence of inhibitor, and KI is the concentration of inhibitor needed for half-maximal effect. The value of KI for (VO4)3− was 1.5 ± 0.1 μm, and it was similar to that reported previously (43.Cantley Jr., L.C. Cantley L.G. Josephson L. A"
https://openalex.org/W2088901293,"Soil disturbance has been widely recognized as an important factor influencing the structure and dynamics of plant communities. Although soil reworkers were shown to increase habitat complexity and raise the risk of plant invasion, their role in regulating the interactions between native and invasive species remains unclear. We proposed that crab activities, via improving soil nitrogen availability, may indirectly affect the interactions between invasive Spartina alterniflora and native Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter in salt marsh ecosystems. We conducted a two-year mesocosm experiment consisting of five species combinations, i.e., monocultures of three species and pair-wise mixtures of invasive and native species, with crabs being either present or absent for each combination. We found that crabs could mitigate soil nitrogen depletion in the mesocosm over the two years. Plant performance of all species, at both the ramet-level (height and biomass per ramet) and plot-level (density, total above- and belowground biomass), were promoted by crab activities. These plants responded to crab disturbance primarily by clonal propagation, as plot-level performance was more sensitive to crabs than ramet-level. Moreover, crab activities altered the competition between Spartina and native plants in favor of the former, since Spartina was more promoted than native plants by crab activities. Our results suggested that crab activities may increase the competition ability of Spartina over native Phragmites and Scirpus through alleviating soil nitrogen limitation."
https://openalex.org/W2062428924,"Diptera are vectors of major human and animal pathogens worldwide, such as dengue, West-Nile or bluetongue viruses. In seasonal environments, vector-borne disease occurrence varies with the seasonal variations of vector abundance. We aimed at understanding how diptera-borne viruses can persist for years under seasonal climates while vectors overwinter, which should stop pathogen transmission during winter. Modeling is a relevant integrative approach for investigating the large panel of persistence mechanisms evidenced through experimental and observational studies on specific biological systems. Inter-seasonal persistence of virus may occur in hosts due to viremia duration, chronic infection, or vertical transmission, in vector resistance stages, and due to a low continuous transmission in winter. Using a generic stochastic modeling framework, we determine the parameter ranges under which virus persistence could occur via these different mechanisms. The parameter ranges vary according to the host demographic regime: for a high host population turnover, persistence increases with the mechanism parameter, whereas for a low turnover, persistence is maximal for an optimal range of parameter. Persistence in hosts due to long viremia duration in a few hosts or due to vertical transmission is an effective strategy for the virus to overwinter. Unexpectedly, a low continuous transmission during winter does not give rise to certain persistence, persistence barely occurring for a low turnover of the susceptible population. We propose a generic framework adaptable to most diptera-borne diseases. This framework allows ones to assess the plausibility of each persistence mechanism in real epidemiological situations and to compare the range of parameter values theoretically allowing persistence with the range of values determined experimentally."
https://openalex.org/W2135232674,"Noninfectious comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases have become increasingly prevalent and occur earlier in life in persons with HIV infection. Despite the emerging body of literature linking environmental exposures to chronic disease outcomes in the general population, the impacts of environmental exposures have received little attention in HIV-infected population. The aim of this study is to investigate whether individuals living with HIV have elevated prevalence of heavy metals compared to non-HIV infected individuals in United States.We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2010 to compare exposures to heavy metals including cadmium, lead, and total mercury in HIV infected and non-HIV infected subjects.In this cross-sectional study, we found that HIV-infected individuals had higher concentrations of all heavy metals than the non-HIV infected group. In a multivariate linear regression model, HIV status was significantly associated with increased blood cadmium (p=0.03) after adjusting for age, sex, race, education, poverty income ratio, and smoking. However, HIV status was not statistically associated with lead or mercury levels after adjusting for the same covariates.Our findings suggest that HIV-infected patients might be significantly more exposed to cadmium compared to non-HIV infected individuals which could contribute to higher prevalence of chronic diseases among HIV-infected subjects. Further research is warranted to identify sources of exposure and to understand more about specific health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2045940111,"The diabetes mellitus Incidence Cohort Registry (DiMelli) aims to characterize diabetes phenotypes by immunologic, metabolic, and genetic markers. We classified patients into three groups according to islet autoantibody status and examined whether patients with multiple diabetes-associated autoantibodies, one autoantibody, or without autoantibodies differed with respect to clinical, metabolic, and genetic parameters, including an insulin sensitivity (IS) score based on waist, HbA1c, and triglycerides. We also assessed whether metabolic markers predicted the immune status.As of June 2012, 630 patients in Bavaria, Germany, aged <20 years diagnosed with any type of diabetes within the preceding 6 months were registered in DiMelli. We compared the clinical and laboratory parameters between islet autoantibody status defined patient groups. Parameters showing the strongest associations were included in principal component analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess the ability of the IS Score to predict islet autoantibody status.Patients with multiple islet autoantibodies, one autoantibody, or without autoantibodies were significantly different in terms of BMI percentile, weight loss before diagnosis, fasting C-peptide (all, P<0.001), and IS Score (P=0.034). However, principal component analysis revealed no distinct patterns according to autoantibody status. At the optimal IS Score cut-off for predicting islet autoantibody positivity (single compared to none), the specificity was 52.0% and the sensitivity was 86.8%. With respect to prediction of multiple autoantibodies (compared to none), specificity and sensitivity were slightly lower and in combination inferior to those obtained using the BMI percentile and fasting C-peptide.The DiMelli study indicated that patients with and without islet autoantibodies differed with respect to metabolic and genetic markers but there was considerable overlap of phenotypes, and autoantibody status could not be predicted by these parameters. Thus, our results suggest that refined diabetes classification may require both immune and metabolic phenotyping."
https://openalex.org/W1976184897,"Background In humans it has been reported that a major site of the latent reservoir of HIV is within CD4+ T cells expressing the memory marker CD45RO, defined by the mAb UCHL1. There are conflicting reports regarding the expression of this antigen in macaques, the most relevant animal species for studying HIV pathogenesis and testing new therapies. There is now a major effort to eradicate HIV reservoirs and cure the infection. One approach is to eliminate subsets of cells housing the latent reservoir, using UCHL1 to target these cells. So that such studies may be performed in macaques, it is essential to determine expression of CD45RO. Methods We have used immunofluorescence and flow cytometry to study cell surface expression of CD45RO on lymphocytes from PBMC, lymphoid, and GI organs of rhesus, pigtailed, and cynomolgus macaques. Both direct and indirect immunofluorescence experiments were performed. Findings CD45RO is expressed on a subset of CD4+ lymphocytes of all pigtailed, a fraction of rhesus, and neither of the cynomolgus macaques studied. The binding of UCHL1 to macaque cells was of lower avidity than to human cells. This could be overcome by forming UCHL1 multimers. Directly conjugating fluors to UCHL1 can inhibit UCHL1 binding to macaque cells. Patterns of UCHL1 expression differ somewhat in macaques and humans, and from that of other memory markers often used in macaques. Conclusions CD45RO, defined with mAb UCHL1, is well expressed on CD4+ cells in pigtailed macaques. Using tissues recovered from latently infected pigtailed macaques we are determining whether UCHL1, or other memory markers, can define the cellular locus of the reservoir. The low avidity of this interaction could limit the utility of UCHL1, in its conventional form, to eliminate cells in vivo and test this approach in macaque models of HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W1990248871,"Proximal spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the most common inherited motor neuropathy and the leading hereditary cause of infant mortality. Currently there is no effective treatment for the disease, reflecting a need for pharmacologic interventions that restore performance of dysfunctional motor neurons or suppress the consequences of their dysfunction. In a series of assays relevant to motor neuron biology, we explored the activities of a collection of tetrahydroindoles that were reported to alter the metabolism of amyloid precursor protein (APP). In Drosophila larvae the compounds suppressed aberrant larval locomotion due to mutations in the Khc and Klc genes, which respectively encode the heavy and light chains of kinesin-1. A representative compound of this class also suppressed the appearance of axonal swellings (alternatively termed axonal spheroids or neuritic beads) in the segmental nerves of the kinesin-deficient Drosophila larvae. Given the importance of kinesin-dependent transport for extension and maintenance of axons and their growth cones, three members of the class were tested for neurotrophic effects on isolated rat spinal motor neurons. Each compound stimulated neurite outgrowth. In addition, consistent with SMA being an axonopathy of motor neurons, the three axonotrophic compounds rescued motor axon development in a zebrafish model of SMA. The results introduce a collection of small molecules as pharmacologic suppressors of SMA-associated phenotypes and nominate specific members of the collection for development as candidate SMA therapeutics. More generally, the results reinforce the perception of SMA as an axonopathy and suggest novel approaches to treating the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2023166978,"In the ultimatum game, two players divide a sum of money. The proposer suggests how to split and the responder can accept or reject. If the suggestion is rejected, both players get nothing. The rational solution is that the responder accepts even the smallest offer but humans prefer fair share. In this paper, we study the ultimatum game by a learning-mutation process based on quantal response equilibrium, where players are assumed boundedly rational and make mistakes when estimating the payoffs of strategies. Social learning is never stabilized at the fair outcome or the rational outcome, but leads to oscillations from offering 40 percent to 50 percent. To be precise, there is a clear tendency to increase the mean offer if it is lower than 40 percent, but will decrease when it reaches the fair offer. If mutations occur rarely, fair behavior is favored in the limit of local mutation. If mutation rate is sufficiently high, fairness can evolve for both local mutation and global mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2034592270,"Rankings are ubiquitous around the world. Here I investigate spatial ranking patterns of English Words and Chinese Characters, and reveal a common construction pattern related to phase separation. In detail, I analyze a list of different words in the English language, and find that the frequency of the number of letters per word linearly or nonlinearly decays over its rank in the frequency table. I interpret the linearly decaying area as a linear phase that covers 96.4% words, which is in sharp contrast to a nonlinear phase (representing the nonlinearly decaying area) that covers the remaining 3.6% words. Amazingly, the phase separation phenomenon with the same two percentages of 96.4% and 3.6% holds also for the relation between strokes and characters in the Chinese language although English and Chinese are two distinctly different language systems. The common construction pattern originates from the log-normal distributions of frequencies of words or characters, which can be understood by the joint effect of both the Weber-Fechner law in psychophysics and the principle of maximum entropy in information theory."
https://openalex.org/W2030956584,"Abnormally high concentrations of extracellular glutamate in the brain may cause neuronal damage via excitotoxicity. Thus, tight regulation of glutamate release is critical to neuronal function and survival. Excitotoxicity is caused mainly by overactivation of the extrasynaptic NMDA receptor (NMDAR) and results in specific cellular changes, including calcium-induced activation of calpain proteases. Here, we report that presenilin-1 (PS1) null mouse cortical neuronal cultures have increased amounts of calpain-dependent spectrin breakdown products (SBDPs) compared with WT cultures. NMDAR antagonists blocked accumulation of SBDPs, suggesting abnormal activation of this receptor in PS1 null cultures. Importantly, an increase in SBDPs was detected in cultures of at least 7 days in vitro but not in younger cultures. Conditioned medium from PS1 null neuronal cultures at 8 days in vitro contained higher levels of glutamate than medium from WT cultures and stimulated production of SBDPs when added to WT cultures. Use of glutamate reuptake inhibitors indicated that accumulation of this neurotransmitter in the media of PS1 null cultures was due to increased rates of release. PS1 null neurons showed decreased cell surface expression and phosphorylation of the GluN2B subunit of NMDAR, indicating decreased amounts of extrasynaptic NMDAR in the absence of PS1. Inhibition of γ-secretase activity in WT neurons caused changes similar to those observed in PS1 null neurons. Together, these data indicate that the PS1/γ-secretase system regulates release of glutamate, tyrosine phosphorylation, and surface expression of GluN2B-containing NMDARs.Background: Presenilin-1/γ-secretase is critical to neuronal function.Results: Inhibition of presenilin-1/γ-secretase increases release of glutamate, stimulating NMDAR and calpain while decreasing phosphorylation and surface expression of neuronal GluN2B.Conclusion: Presenilin-1/γ-secretase regulates glutamate release, NMDAR-dependent calpain activity, and modification of GluN2B.Significance: This study reveals a role for γ-secretase in release of glutamate, a neurotransmitter central to neuronal function, and excitotoxicity, a stress important to neurodegeneration.

https://openalex.org/W2045512719,"The present study examined effects of role-play experience on reading the mind of people with different perception. It is normally difficult but very important in daily life to understand people with different characteristics, including those with restricted color vision. We explored the mechanisms of reading the mind of people with different perception. Forty university students were introduced to a communication task in which the use of mindreading was essential. During each trial, participants viewed a shelf, presented on a laptop computer, which contained several familiar objects, and they were instructed to touch an object on the shelf following an instruction issued by a partner who stood at the opposite side of the shelf. There were two partners: one was a monkey with normal color vision and the other was a dog with restricted color vision. The monkey could see all the objects in the same colors as the participants, whereas the dog saw some objects in different colors (e.g., he saw as yellow objects that the participants saw as red). Participants were required to respond according to the partner's instruction. In the restricted color vision condition, the dog saw the colors of objects differently; thus, participants had to work out his intentions (i.e., mind read), according to his different perspective. In the normal color vision condition, all objects were in the same colors as those seen by the monkey. Before the test phase, the role-play group had a role-play experience in which participants assumed the role of people with restricted color vision. No-role-play participants made significantly more errors in the restricted color vision condition than in the normal color vision condition, whereas among role-play participants, there was no difference between conditions. These results suggest that role-play experience facilitates reading the mind of people with perceptual experiences different from our own."
https://openalex.org/W2055062132,"Background The hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and treponema pallidum (TP) are blood-borne pathogens. They can lead to nosocomial and occupational infections in health care settings. We aimed to identify the prevalence of and risk factors associated with HBV, HCV, HIV and TP infections among patients with eye diseases at a tertiary eye hospital in Southern China. Methods From July 2011 to June 2012, a total of 26,386 blood units were collected from eye patients, including inpatients and the day surgery patients at Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, one of the biggest eye hospitals in China. Based on the primary diagnoses from this period, the subjects were classified into different ocular disease groups. All blood samples were tested for HBsAg, anti-HCV, anti-HIV and anti-TP. Result The overall prevalence of HBV, HCV, TP and HIV was 9.79%, 0.99%, 2.43% and 0.11%, respectively. The prevalence of HBsAg was much lower among patients younger than 20 years compared to other age groups. In addition, the risk of HBsAg was associated with the male gender, ocular trauma and glaucoma. The prevalence of TP increased with age and the prevalence among patients older than 30 was higher than that in patients younger than 20 years. Conclusions The prevalence of HBV, HCV, HIV and TP in patients with eye diseases was identified. This information can be utilised to strengthen the health education and implementation of universal safety precautions to prevent the spread of blood-borne pathogens in health care settings."
