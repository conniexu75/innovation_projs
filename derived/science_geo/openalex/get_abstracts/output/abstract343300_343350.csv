https://openalex.org/W1970018403,"A new system of high-temperature superconductors is reported. The compounds, Mo(6 - x)A(x)S(6) where A is Cu, Zn, Mg, Ag, Cd, Sn, or Pb, are rhombohedral with a approximately 6.5 angstroms and approximately 90 degrees . The transition temperatures range from approximately 2.5 degrees K for the Cd compound to approximately 13 degrees K for the Pb compound."
https://openalex.org/W1999283805,"Empirical laws psychology may be based on physical measurements (for example, voltages, times), counting, ordering, or just classifying. It is a pointless, though widespread practice to use a physical measure or a count as a ""definition"" of a psychological variable; this practice obscures the fact that all one has done is measured a physical variable, or counted. What is important are the empirical laws that are established by use of such quantitative or qualitative observations. Some kinds of empirical relations and laws yield measurement structures, akin to the qualitative structures underlying fundamental measurement in physics. Measurement structures are empirical structures that can be described most simply by introduction of a new numerical function; such a function is a new measure, and is typically interpreted as measuring some particular psychological variable Measurement structures, formulated abstractly, sometimes provide valuable tools for formulating new empirical hypotheses to be tested; but in many instances, other kinds of theory may be more appropriate. The main focus of research ought always to be the discovery of simple laws; these may or may not lead to new measures."
https://openalex.org/W2005527847,"The emergence of the adult cecropia silk moth from the pupal skin involves a stereotyped series of abdominal movements-the pre-eclosion behavior. This behavior, triggered by a neurosecretory hormone, consists of three phases that are characterized by the relative frequency and pattern of movements. Electrical recordings from a nerve cord with severed peripheral nerves demonstrate that the pre-eclosion behavior is prepatterned in the abdominal ganglia. In response to the hormone, the entire 1.25-hour behavioral program can be activated and ""read off"" in the absence of sensory feedback."
https://openalex.org/W2075134774,"Both cis-9-and cis-11-tetradecenyl acetate were isolated from 2500 virgin females of the summer fruit tortrix moth Adoxophyes orana (F.v.R.) by gel permeation, column chromatography on silica gel, and gas chromatography. Their chemical, physical, and biological properties were identical to those of the synthetic compounds. In contrast to the single compounds, mixtures of these pheromones were highly active in laboratory and field tests. Catches, in traps, with the pheromone mixture were comparable to those obtained when live females were used as bait. This is the first example of a member of the lepidoptera in which the presence of two isomers is an absolute requirement for activity in laboratory and in field experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2091923918,"A unique, species-specific amino acid composition is identified with each of 16 species of planktonic Foraminifera isolated from the tops of deep-sea sediment cores. This amino acid pattern appears to directly reflect the genotype. The total amino acid content ranges from 2.0 to 4.2 micromoles per gram of calcified tissue or 0.02 to 0.04 percent by weight. Analyses of two Early Miocene species indicate that characteristic compositional differences are sufficiently well preserved over geologic time to determine phylogenetic affinities among extinct species living at least 18 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W1965003389,"A return expedition to the hot brine area of the Red Sea in 1971 found that the temperature of the brine had increased, indicating that the process that formed the underlying deposits rich in heavy metals is still occurring. About 0.346 cubic kilometers of water having a minimum temperature of 104 degrees C has been added over the last 52 months. Calculations suggest that this water may have come from a relatively shallow depth; this result coupled with the fact that fracture zones are found north and south of the brine area indicates a relatively local source for the brine, rather than the Strait of Bab el Mandeb, as previously suggested."

https://openalex.org/W2060463278,"Notwithstanding the relatively low degree of ground resolution, many of the major structural features of Alaska can be identified on the Nimbus IV IDCS image, exposed at an altitude of 600 nautical miles (1100 km). In addition, linears of regional extent that may be structurally controlled can be seen, many of which have not yet been recognized in surface mapping. The synoptic view provided by the image brings into focus an orthogonal set of fractures trending north-northeast and east-south-east and not heretofore apparent in regional maps of Alaska. This orthogonal fracture set may reflect a conjugate set of fractures within the crust, which has exerted significant control over the geologic history of the state. Increased resolution in other images from space platforms, such as the resolution of 200 to 650 feet (60 to 200 m) planned for the satellite television cameras of the ERTS program (20), will permit the discernment of finer detail and a greater accuracy in identifying and locating geologic features."

https://openalex.org/W2027646770,An elliptical caldera (2.1 by 2.8 kilometers) at the summit of Mauna Kea volcano is inferred to lie buried beneath hawaiite lava flows and pyroclastic cones at an altitude of approximately 3850 meters. Stratigraphic relationships indicate that hawaiite eruptions began before a pre-Wisconsin period of ice-cap glaciation and that the crest of the mountain attained its present altitude and gross form during a glaciation of probable Early Wisconsin age.

Several weeks later an eruption occurred very close to this site. The high noise level appeared to be associated in some way with the impending eruption."
