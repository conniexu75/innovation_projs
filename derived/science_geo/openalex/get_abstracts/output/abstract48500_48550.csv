https://openalex.org/W2121134984,"Using modified adenovirus and beta-globin transcription units, I constructed pairs of transcripts that contained mutually complementary sequences in their introns. Upon incubation of the annealed transcripts in a cell-free splicing system, an exon from one member of the dimeric complex was accurately spliced to an exon from the other. The occurrence of such intermolecular, or trans, splicing in vitro raises the possibility that some of the mRNAs in a cell acquire exons from more than one primary transcript."
https://openalex.org/W1965238536,"Two exon segments from two separate RNA molecules can be joined in a trans splicing process. In trans splicing reactions, an RNA molecule containing an exon, a 5' splice site, and adjacent intron sequences was mixed with an RNA molecule containing an exon, a 3' splice site, and adjacent intron sequences. The efficiency of trans splicing of these two RNAs increased if the two termini of the intervening sequences were paired in a short RNA duplex. However, trans splicing of two RNA molecules with no significant complementarity was also observed. These results strongly suggest that significant secondary structures within intervening sequences could affect the splicing of flanking exons. Similarly, RNAs that are complementary to segments within the intervening sequences could potentially regulate the selection of splice sites. Finally, some organisms might use trans splicing to distribute a single exon to many different mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2006036404,"The N-myc gene, which is distantly related to the proto-oncogene c-myc, was first detected as an amplified sequence in human neuroblastoma cell lines and tumours1,2. It has since been revealed that there is up to a 300-fold amplification of N-myc DNA in almost 50% of advanced metastatic human neuroblastomas, whereas amplification is not detected in less advanced tumours that have a better prognosis (ref. 3 and M.S., unpublished data). Although expression of N-myc is detectable in all neuroblastoma cell lines and tumours examined, its level is greatly enhanced when the N-myc gene is amplified4,5. Recently, it has been shown that on co-transfection with the c-Ha-ras (EJ) gene, N-myc can induce the malignant transformation of rat embryo fibroblasts6. Taken together, these data imply a function for N-myc in the development and/or progression of human neuroblastomas. Surveys indicate that N-myc also may be amplified and/or expressed in two other types of human tumours and cell lines derived from them: retino-blastomas and small cell lung cancers4,5,7,8. Here, we report that N-myc is expressed at high levels in mouse and human teratocarcinoma stem cells, thus identifying another tumour cell type that expresses the N-myc gene. In addition, we found that N-myc is abundantly expressed in mouse embryos at mid-gestation and that its expression appears to decrease as the embryo approaches term. In the adult mouse, N-myc is expressed at an approximately fivefold lower level in the brain than in teratocarcinoma stem cells and embryos, and at even lower levels in the adult testis and kidney. Our data represent the first demonstration of expression of the N-myc gene in normal cells, and suggest that N-myc may be involved in mammalian embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1579538028,"We have previously reported that molybdate-stabilized cytosol prepared from 32P-labeled L-cells contains two phosphoproteins (a 90-92- and a 98-100-kDa protein) that elute from an affinity resin of deoxycorticosterone-derivatized agarose in a manner consistent with the predicted behavior of the glucocorticoid receptor (Housley, P. R., and Pratt, W. B. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 4630-4635). In the present work we report that both the 90-92- and 98-100-kDa 32P-labeled proteins are also extracted from molybdate-stabilized cytosol by incubation with a monoclonal antibody and protein A-Sepharose. Only the 98-100-kDa protein is specifically labeled when either L-cell cytosol or L-cell cytosol proteins bound to the affinity resin are labeled with the glucocorticoid binding site-specific affinity ligand [3H]dexamethasone 21-mesylate. The 98-100-kDa protein labeled with [3H]dexamethasone mesylate is adsorbed to protein A-Sepharose in an immune-specific manner after reaction with the monoclonal antibody. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel analysis of the protein A-Sepharose-bound material resulting from incubating the monoclonal antibody with a mixture of 32P-labeled cytosol and [3H]dexamethasone mesylate-labeled cytosol demonstrates identity of the 98-100-kDa [3H]dexamethasone mesylate-labeled band with the 98-100-kDa 32P-labeled band and clear separation from the nonsteroid-binding 90-92-kDa phosphoprotein. The results of immunoblot experiments demonstrate that the 90-92-kDa protein is structurally distinct from the 98-100-kDa steroid-binding protein. As the 90-92-kDa nonsteroid-binding phosphoprotein co-purified with the 98-100-kDa uncleaved form of the glucocorticoid receptor by two independent methods, one of which is based on recognizing a steroid-binding site and the other of which is based on recognizing an antibody binding site, we propose that the 90-92-kDa phosphoprotein is a component of the molybdate-stabilized, untransformed glucocorticoid-receptor complex in L-cell cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1504728510,"Phosphorylation of the insulin receptor was studied in intact well differentiated hepatoma cells (Fao) and in a solubilized and partially purified receptor preparation obtained from these cells by affinity chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin agarose. Tryptic peptides containing the phosphorylation sites of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor were analyzed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Phosphoamino acid content of these peptides was determined by acid hydrolysis and high voltage electrophoresis. Separation of the phosphopeptides from unstimulated Fao cells revealed one major and two minor phosphoserine-containing peptides and a single minor phosphothreonine-containing peptide. Insulin (10(-7) M) increased the phosphorylation of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor 3- to 4-fold in the intact Fao cell. After insulin stimulation, two phosphotyrosine-containing peptides were identified. Tyrosine phosphorylation reached a steady state within 20 s after the addition of insulin and remained nearly constant for 1 h. Under our experimental conditions, no significant change in the amount of [32P]phosphoserine or [32P]phosphothreonine associated with the beta-subunit was found during the initial response of cells to insulin. When the insulin receptor was extracted from the Fao cells and incubated in vitro with [gamma-32P]ATP and Mn2+, very little phosphorylation occurred in the absence of insulin. In this preparation, insulin rapidly stimulated autophosphorylation of the receptor on tyrosine residues only and high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the beta-subunit digested with trypsin revealed one minor and two major phosphopeptides. The elution position of the minor peptide corresponded to that of the major phosphotyrosine-containing peptide obtained from the beta-subunit of the insulin-stimulated receptor labeled in vivo. In contrast, the elution position of one of the major phosphopeptides that occurred during in vitro phosphorylation corresponded to the minor phosphotyrosine-containing peptide phosphorylated in vivo. The other major in vitro phosphotyrosine-containing peptide was not detected in vivo. Our results indicate that: tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor occurs rapidly following insulin binding to intact cells; the level of tyrosine phosphorylation remains constant for up to 1 h; the specificity of the receptor kinase or accessibility of the phosphorylation sites are different in vivo and in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W2012539726,"We recently described a carrier-mediated nuclear transport system for tRNA in Xenopus laevis oocytes. A natural human tRNAimet variant with a G to T transversion in position 57 is defective in transport across the nuclear membrane. In addition, processing of the primary transcript of the variant gene is much less efficient than the wild type. We now describe the nuclear transport and processing phenotypes of 30 different point mutants generated by in vitro mutagenesis of a wild-type human tRNAimet gene. The effects of each nucleotide change on processing and transport were analyzed in X. laevis oocytes following nuclear microinjection of each mutant gene. Mutants exhibiting transport-defective behavior were further characterized by measuring transport kinetics of the purified mature tRNA. Our studies demonstrate that many mutations affect tRNAimet nuclear transport, although those with the most deleterious effects are clustered in the highly conserved D stem-loop and T stem-loop regions."
https://openalex.org/W1485908731,"Laminin, a glycoprotein component of basal laminae, is synthesized and secreted in culture by a human malignant cell line (JAR) derived from gestational choriocarcinoma. Biosynthetically labeled human laminin subunits A (Mr approximately 400,000) and B (Mr = 200,000 doublet) are glycoslyated with asparagine-linked high mannose oligosaccharides that are processed to complex oligosaccharides before the laminin molecule is externalized by the cell. The rate-limiting step in the processing of the asparagine-linked glycans of laminin is at the point of action of alpha-mannosidase I since the principal laminin forms that accumulate in JAR cells contain Man9GlcNAc2 and Man8GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide units. The combination of subunits to form the disulfide-linked laminin molecule (Mr approximately 950,000) occurs rapidly within the cell at a time when the subunits contain these high mannose oligosaccharides. The production of laminin is limited by the availability of the A subunit such that excess B subunit forms accumulate intracellularly as uncombined B and a disulfide-linked B dimer. Pulse-chase kinetic studies establish these B forms as intermediates in the assembly of the laminin molecule. The fully assembled laminin undergoes further oligosaccharide processing and translocation to the cell surface, but uncombined B and B dimer are neither processed nor secreted to any significant extent. Therefore, laminin subunit combination appears to be a prerequisite for intracellular translocation, processing, and secretion. The mature laminin that contains complex oligosaccharides does not accumulate intracellularly but is rapidly externalized upon completion, either secreted into the culture medium (25%) or associated with the cell surface (75%) as determined by susceptibility to degradation by trypsin. About one-third of the laminin molecules secreted or shed by JAR cells into the chase medium contain a smaller A subunit form that appears to have been modified by limited proteolytic cleavage. The putative proteolytic event is closely timed to the release of the laminin into the culture medium."
https://openalex.org/W68027181,"The archaebacterium Halobacterium volcanii contains a single expressed gene for tRNATrp. This gene is interrupted, at a position corresponding to two nucleotides 3' to the anticodon, by an 105-base pair intervening sequence. Northern hybridization experiments show that the gene is transcribed in its entirety in vivo into a precursor of at least 180 nucleotides, and that one of the products of post-transcriptional processing is a 105-nucleotide species containing intron-specific sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1545949007,"The function of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) is not known in mammals. It is well-established in the amphibian Xenopus laevis in which alpha-MSH mediates the process of adaptation to a dark background. The amino acid sequence of this hormone is, however, not known in amphibians. In order to determine the primary structure of the precursor protein for alpha-MSH, which in mammals has been called pro-opiomelancortin (POMC), we constructed a cDNA library from Xenopus pituitary mRNA. A pool of synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide tetradecamers corresponding to part of the mammalian alpha-MSH sequence was used to screen the library. The nucleotide sequence of a 1050-base pair hybridization-positive cDNA clone was determined and the deduced amino acid sequence of Xenopus POMC revealed the sequences of Xenopus gamma-MSH, alpha-MSH, corticotropin-like intermediate lobe peptide, beta-MSH, and beta-endorphin. Interestingly, the N-terminal amino acid of Xenopus alpha-MSH, which is N alpha-acetylated in the biologically active form of the hormone, is different from that of mammalian alpha-MSH. The distribution of the bioactive domains within Xenopus POMC is remarkably similar to that in other known POMC molecules and as in mammals the domains in the amphibian prohormone are flanked on both sides by pairs of basic amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1521585633,"Medullary thyroid carcinoma is a tumor of the calcitonin-secreting thyroid C-cell, with a variable malignant potential. Virulent tumors are characterized by decreased calcitonin production, suggesting the emergence of a less differentiated medullary thyroid carcinoma cell. In order to further delineate relationships between tumor progression and status of differentiation of medullary thyroid carcinoma cells, we have sought to chemically manipulate the TT cell line, an established culture of human medullary thyroid carcinoma, derived from a patient with aggressive disease. We found that the phorbol esters, 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate 1) altered the morphology of the TT cells towards that of high-calcitonin-containing cells; 2) enhanced calcitonin secretion 7-fold; 3) increased calcitonin production at the transcriptional level by 2-fold; 4) inhibited cellular proliferation; and 5) decreased, by 80%, the levels of the c-myc gene mRNA. These data suggest that phorbol esters induce, in human medullary thyroid carcinoma cells in culture, a programmed pattern of events resulting in differentiation of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1997247216,"A panel of human-mouse somatic cell hybrids and specific complementary DNA probes were used to map the human tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase genes to human chromosomes 8 and 10, respectively. This result is in contrast to a previous assignment of a plasminogen activator gene to chromosome 6. As neoplastic cells produce high levels of plasminogen activator, it is of interest that aberrations of chromosome 8 have been linked to various leukemias and lymphomas and that two human oncogenes, c-mos and c-myc, have also been mapped to chromosome 8."
https://openalex.org/W3118720052,"The binding constant for estrogen receptor-DNA interaction when measured in the presence and absence of estradiol revealed a distinct difference dependent upon whether the receptor was hormone-bound or hormone-free. The binding constant of estrogen receptor-DNA interaction was determined by analysis of the exponential elution profile of the estrogen receptor from DNA-Sepharose columns using Tris buffer at a constant salt concentration. The binding constant of the hormone-bound estrogen receptor for DNA in Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.2 M KCl was 10.1 +/- 0.8 X 10(6) M-1, 5-fold higher than the value for the hormone-free estrogen receptor. Analysis of the number of ionic bonds between the estrogen receptor and DNA indicates that the hormone-free receptor establishes eight salt bridges, while the hormone-bound estrogen receptor establishes 10-13. The affinity of the hormone-bound estrogen receptor for DNA in Tris buffer at pH 7.4 in 0.2 M KCl is 10-fold greater than at pH 8.0, suggesting that ionic bonding between the receptor and DNA may involve histidine residues of the receptor. The concentration-dependence of the hormone-bound receptor's affinity for DNA emphasizes the receptor's associative state as an influence on the receptor's DNA binding characteristics. Our results demonstrate that estradiol modifies the conformation of the estrogen receptor to a state having an increased affinity for DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2000501663,A complementary DNA library was constructed from messenger RNA's extracted from the brains of mice infected with the scrapie agent. The library was differentially screened with the objectives of finding clones that might be used as markers of infection and finding clones of genes whose increased expression might be correlated with the pathological changes common to scrapie and Alzheimer's disease. A gene was identified whose expression is increased in scrapie. The complementary DNA corresponding to this gene hybridized preferentially and focally to cells in the brains of scrapie-infected animals. The cloned DNA also hybridized to the neuritic plaques found with increased frequency in brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
https://openalex.org/W1535907141,"Abstract We have previously reported that the primary transcript of the human tRNAMeti gene undergoes accurate processing to a mature 72-nucleotide species by activities present in the high speed supernatant of Xenopus laevis ovarian extracts (Zasloff, M., Santos, T., Romeo, P., and Rosenberg, M. (1982a) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 7857-7863). We now report the purification and characterization of the enzyme which processes the 3' terminus of the human pre-tRNAMeti species. The activity has been purified about 500-fold from a high speed supernatant of X. laevis ovarian extracts by standard methods. It appears to function as a single polypeptide with a molecular weight of about 97,400. The enzyme generates the mature 3' terminus with a single endonucleolytic cut, also yielding the intact 3' trailer. The endonuclease has a striking preference for the 5' processed pre-tRNAMeti, exhibiting little or no activity in vitro on the intact primary transcript. The enzyme acts similarly with the pre-tRNAAla species of Bombyx mori, suggesting that it possesses a broad substrate range. The requirement of the 3' processing endonuclease for a processed 5' terminus suggests that eukaryotic pre-tRNA processing should follow an ordered cutting sequence in vivo with processing of the 5' leader preceding 3' end maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1520325642,Transfer RNA biosynthesis is a complex process which includes size trimming and nucleotide modification of an initial tRNA precursor. We have examined the temporal order and the nature of tRNA processing events in a Drosophila in vitro transcription/processing system using Drosophila tRNA genes as templates. RNA sequence analysis of processing products indicates that processing at both 5' and 3' ends occurs by endonucleolytic cleavage. The time course of processing of an initial tRNA precursor to mature tRNA reveals that trimming at the 5' end precedes 3' end maturation.
https://openalex.org/W1588268100,"Several analogs of alkylacetylglycerophosphocholine (AGEPC; platelet-activating factor) were investigated as potential selective inhibitors of AGEPC-induced activation of washed rabbit platelets. Two particular compounds, CV-3988 (rac-3-(N-n-octadecylcarbamoyloxy)-2-methoxypropyl-2-thiazolioethyl++ + phosphate) and U66985 (1-O-octadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoric acid-6'-trimethylammonium-hexyl ester) emerged as particularly active and effective inhibitors. Aggregation and secretion profiles, as well as the degradation of inositol phospholipids and production of phosphatidic acid, were used as monitors of their inhibitory capabilities. U66985 was the most effective inhibitor, giving an IC50 value of 4.1 +/- 1.5 X 10(-8) M against a challenge of 1 X 10(-10) M AGEPC in the secretion assay. Phospholipid turnover was blocked completely at this inhibitor concentration. On the other hand, while CV-3988 was an effective inhibitor, a higher concentration was required and a more restricted range of activity was noted with an IC50 value of 5.9 +/- 1.3 X 10(-7) M against a challenge of 1 X 10(-10) M AGEPC in the secretion assay. While CV-3988 did indeed completely block the turnover of inositol phospholipids and phosphatidic acid formation, these effects were noted at a higher concentration than with U66985. On the basis of data obtained in desensitization experiments with AGEPC and U66985, it appears that each inhibitor occupies the same receptor site as the agonist, AGEPC. These results illustrate the usefulness of these AGEPC analogs in exploring the biochemical characteristics of the interaction of AGEPC with a cell."
https://openalex.org/W2169544012,"The Tetrahymena rRNA intervening sequence (IVS) excises itself from the pre-rRNA and then mediates its own cyclization. We now find that certain di- and trinucleotides with free 3' hydroxyl groups reopen the circular IVS at the cyclization junction, producing a linear molecule with the oligonucleotide covalently attached to its 5' end. This linear molecule recyclizes with release of the added oligonucleotide. Thus the IVS RNA, like an enzyme, lowers the activation energy for both forward and reverse cleavage-ligation reactions. Certain combinations of pyrimidines are required for circle reopening. The most reactive oligonucleotide is UCU. This sequence resembles those preceding the major and minor cyclization sites in the linear IVS RNA (UUU and CCU) and the 5' splice site in the pre-rRNA (UCU). We propose that an oligopyrimidine binding site within the IVS binds the sequences upstream of each of these target sites for cleavage-ligation."
https://openalex.org/W1535339880,Serum antifreeze polypeptides (AFP) from Newfoundland ocean pout have been resolved by ion exchange chromatography and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography into at least 12 components. The protein sequences of three of the AFP were determined using a combination of protein Edman degradation and cDNA sequencing. The AFP precursor protein encodes for a preprotein of 87 amino acids with no obvious prosequences. Two of the AFP (SP1-A and SP1-C) were separate gene products with minor amino acid sequence differences. The protein structure of SP1-C precursor is MKSVILTGLLFVLLCVDHMTASQSVVAT QLIPINTALTPAMMEGKVTNPIGIPFAEMSQIVGKQVNTPVAKGQTLMPNMVKTYVAGK. The third AFP (SP1-B) is a post-translation modification product of SP1-C. These experiments indicate that the ocean pout AFP are a multigene family with protein structure different from any other known polypeptide antifreezes.
https://openalex.org/W1555373432,"This study addresses whether transcriptional control of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase gene in rat liver plays a role in determining the level of reductase mRNA. Isolated rat liver nuclei were allowed to elongate nascent RNA transcripts in the presence of [alpha-32P]CTP, and radiolabeled nuclear reductase RNA was quantitated by filter hybridization. Rats fed a diet supplemented with the drugs cholestyramine and mevinolin and having 20-60-fold induced levels of reductase mRNA exhibited levels of reductase transcription which were 20-fold higher than in rats fed an unsupplemented diet. Over 90% of the transcription of the reductase gene was inhibited by concentrations of alpha-amanitin which selectively inhibit RNA polymerase II. Administration of mevalonolactone (the end product of the reaction catalyzed by reductase) to rats fed cholestyramine and mevinolin caused an 80% decrease in the rate of reductase transcription by approximately 1 h. We conclude that under these conditions changes in reductase transcription are primarily responsible for the regulation of reductase mRNA levels."
https://openalex.org/W2079993992,The T antigen proteins encoded by DNA tumor virus early genes are involved in the transformation of normal cells to immortalized neoplastic cells that may or may not be tumorigenic in immunocompetent animals. Studies have been made of the tumorigenicity of DNA virus-transformed cells and the interactions of these cells in vivo and in vitro with immunologically nonspecific host effector cells such as natural killer cells and macrophages. The results imply that the T proteins determine the capacity of transformed cells to induce tumors by governing the level of susceptibility that transformed cells express to destruction by such host cellular defenses.
https://openalex.org/W1562821108,"Multigene families encode the proline-rich proteins that are so prominent in human saliva and are dramatically induced in mouse and rat salivary glands by isoproterenol treatment and by feeding tannins. A cDNA encoding an acidic proline-rich protein of rat has been sequenced (Ziemer, M. A., Swain, W. F., Rutter, W. J., Clements, S., Ann, D. K., and Carlson D. M. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 10475-10480). This study presents the nucleotide sequences of five additional proline-rich protein cDNAs complementary to both mouse and rat parotid and submandibular gland mRNAs. Amino acid compositions deduced from the nucleotide sequences are typical for proline-rich proteins: 25-45% proline, 18-22% glycine, and 18-22% glutamine and generally an absence of sulfur-containing amino acids except for the initiator methionine. These proline-rich proteins display unusual repeating peptide sequences of 14-19 amino acids. The derived amino acid sequence of the cDNA insert of plasmid pMP1 from mouse has a 19-amino acid sequence which is repeated four times. The inserts of plasmids pUMP40 and pUMP4 also from mouse encode for 12 and 11 repeats of a 14-amino acid peptide, respectively. These repetitive sequences, and others from rat and mouse cDNAs and from human genomic clones, all show very high homologies and likely evolved from duplication of internal portions of an ancestral gene. Gene conversion could account for the high degree of conservation of nucleotide sequences of the repeat regions. Protein derived from the nucleotide sequences are all characterized by four general regions: a putative signal peptide, a transition region, the repetitive region, and a carboxyl-terminal region. The 5'-flanking sequences and sequences encoding the putative signal peptides are highly conserved (greater than 94%) in all six cDNAs. This sequence conservation may be important in the regulation of the biosynthesis of these unusual proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1511662427,"The consequence of blocking the de novo synthesis of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) on mitochondrial ubiquinone content and respiratory function was studied in cultured C1300 (Neuro 2A) murine neuroblastoma cells. Mevinolin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, was used to suppress the synthesis of mevalonate, an essential precursor for the isoprenoid side chain of ubiquinone. At a concentration of 25 microM, mevinolin completely inhibited the incorporation of [3H]acetate into ubiquinone, isolated from cell extracts by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography. Similar results were obtained when [14C]tyrosine was used as a precursor for the quinone ring. Through the use of reverse-phase thin-layer chromatography, it was established that the principal product of the ubiquinone pathway in murine neuroblastoma cells was ubiquinone-9. Inhibition of ubiquinone synthesis for 24h in cells cultured in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum (which contains 0.14 nmol of ubiquinone/ml of serum) resulted in a 40-57% decline in the concentration of ubiquinone in the mitochondria. However, the activities of succinate-cytochrome c reductase and succinate dehydrogenase in whole-cell homogenates or mitochondria were not inhibited. The state 3 and uncoupled rates of respiration, determined by polarographic measurements of oxygen consumption in homogenates and mitochondria, were elevated slightly in the mevinolin-treated cells. The data demonstrate that, although mevalonate synthesis is important for the maintenance of the intramitochondrial ubiquinone pool in cultured cells, major changes in the ubiquinone content of the mitochondria can occur in intact cells without perturbation of respiratory function. However, the coincidence of decreased mitochondrial ubiquinone concentration and the inhibition of cell cycling previously observed in mevinolin-treated cells (Maltese, W.A. (1984) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 120, 454-460) suggests that the availability of ubiquinone may play a role in the regulation of mitochondrial and cellular proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1592971923,"We describe the isolation and sequence analysis of quail muscle cDNA clones encoding two closely related isoforms of the striated muscle contractile protein, troponin T. The cDNAs represent two troponin T mRNAs that exhibit an unusual sequence relationship. The two mRNAs have identical sequences over hundreds of nucleotides including 3' untranslated regions, but they differ dramatically in a discrete, internally located block of 38 nucleotides. The two alternative sequences of this 38-nucleotide block encode two different but related versions of amino acid residues 230-242, near the C terminus of the protein. These results are consistent with a novel mechanism of troponin T isoform generation by alternative mRNA splicing pathways from a single gene containing two different exons corresponding to amino acids 229-242, as recently proposed by Medford et al. (Medford, R. M., Nguyen, H. T., Destree, A. T., Summers, E., and Nadal-Ginard, B. (1984) Cell 38, 409-421). This proposal was based on analysis of a rat troponin T genomic DNA clone and a cDNA clone corresponding to one of the two alternatively spliced mRNAs. Our analysis of quail troponin T cDNA clones, apparently corresponding to two alternatively spliced mRNA species, provides important new evidence for this novel mechanism of troponin T isoform generation and reveals the differential splicing mechanism to be of great antiquity, antedating the bird-mammal divergence. One of the quail alternative isoform sequences clearly corresponds to one of the rat sequences, but the other quail alternative sequence does not correspond to either of the rat sequences. This result suggests a greater complexity of troponin T gene structure or a greater diversity of troponin T isoform genes than is currently known, and also has implications for the functional significance of the troponin T protein isoform heterogeneity. Comparison of quail and mammal alternative isoform sequences also reveals strongly conserved features which suggest that all the isoform alternative amino acid sequences are variations on a common structural theme."
https://openalex.org/W1490499402,"Binding of the 5-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein (IAF)-labeled high molecular weight (HMW) kininogen light chain to prekallikrein and D-Phe-Phe-Arg-CH2Cl-inactivated kallikrein was monitored by a 0.040 +/- 0.002 increase in fluorescence anisotropy. Indistinguishable average dissociation constants and stoichiometries of 14 +/- 3 nM and 1.1 +/- 0.1 mol of prekallikrein/mol of IAF-light chain and 17 +/- 3 nM and 0.9 +/- 0.1 mol of kallikrein/mol of IAF-light chain were determined for these interactions at pH 7.4, mu 0.14 and 22 degrees C. Prekallikrein which had been reduced and alkylated in 6 M guanidine HCl lost the ability to increase the fluorescence anisotropy of the IAF-kininogen light chain, suggesting that the native tertiary structure was required for tight binding. The kallikrein heavy and light chains were separated on the basis of the affinity of the heavy chain for HMW-kininogen-Sepharose, after mild reduction and alkylation of kallikrein under nondenaturing conditions. Under these conditions, alkylation with iodo [14C]acetamide demonstrated that only limited chemical modification had occurred. Binding of the IAF-kininogen light chain to the isolated alkylated kallikrein heavy chain, when compared to prekallikrein and kallikrein, was characterized by an indistinguishable increase in fluorescence anisotropy, average dissociation constant of 14 +/- 3 nM, and stoichiometry of 1.2 +/- 0.1 mol of kallikrein heavy chain/mol of IAF-light chain. In contrast, no binding of the D-Phe-Phe-Arg-CH2Cl-inactivated kallikrein light chain was detected at concentrations up to 500 nM. Furthermore, 300 nM kallikrein light chain did not affect IAF-kininogen light chain binding to prekallikrein, kallikrein, or the kallikrein heavy chain. The binding of monomeric single chain HMW-kininogen to prekallikrein, kallikrein, and the kallikrein heavy and light chains was studied using the IAF-kininogen light chain as a probe. Analysis of the competitive binding of HMW-kininogen gave average dissociation constants and stoichiometries of 12 +/- 2 nM and 1.2 +/- 0.1 mol of prekallikrein/mol of HMW-kininogen, 15 +/- 2 nM and 1.3 +/- 0.1 mol of kallikrein/mol of HMW-kininogen, 14 +/- 3 nM and 1.4 +/- 0.2 mol of kallikrein heavy chain/mol of HMW-kininogen, and no detectable effect of 300 nM kallikrein light chain on these interactions. We conclude that a specific, nonenzymatic interaction between sites located exclusively on the light chain of HMW-kininogen and the heavy chain of kallikrein or prekallikrein is responsible for the formation of 1:1 noncovalent complexes between these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1588266624,"Abstract The mitochondrial isoenzyme of aspartate amino-transferase (mAspAT; subunit Mr 45,000) is synthesized on free polysomes in the cytosol as a precursor of higher Mr (pre-mAspAT; Sonderegger, P., Jaussi, R., Christen, P., and Gehring, H. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 3339-3345). We have isolated three overlapping cDNA clones that correspond almost to the full length of pre-mAspAT mRNA with 100 nucleotides at the 5' end missing. The mRNA is 2.1 kilobase pairs long and has a 3' noncoding region of 0.7 kilobase pairs. The cDNAs code for the 401 amino acid residues of mAspAT plus an NH2-terminal pre-piece. Deviations from the reported amino acid sequence were found at positions 154 and 202 where the cDNA specifies Gln instead of Glu. The pre-piece consists of 22 amino acid residues, among them 4 arginine and no acidic residues."
https://openalex.org/W1593443523,"The phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2 alpha that occurs when rabbit reticulocyte lysate is incubated in the absence of hemin or with poly(I.C) causes inhibition of polypeptide chain initiation by preventing a separate factor (termed RF) from promoting the exchange of GTP for GDP on eIF-2. When lysate was incubated in the presence of hemin and [14C] eIF-2 or [alpha-32P]GTP, we observed binding of eIF-2 and GDP or GTP to 60 S ribosomal subunits that was slightly greater than that bound to 40 S subunits and little binding to 80 S ribosomes. When incubation was in the absence of hemin or in the presence of hemin plus 0.1 microgram/ml poly(I.C), eIF-2 and GDP binding to 60 S subunits was increased 1.5- to 2-fold, that bound to 80 S ribosomes was almost as great as that bound to 60 S subunits, and that bound to 40 S subunits was unchanged. Our data indicate that about 40% of the eIF-2 that becomes bound to 60 S subunits and 80 S ribosomes in the absence of hemin or with poly(I.C) is eIF-2(alpha-P) and suggest that the eIF-2 and GDP bound is probably in the form of a binary complex. The accumulation of eIF-2.GDP on 60 S subunits occurs before binding of Met-tRNAf to 40 S subunits becomes reduced and before protein synthesis becomes inhibited. The rate of turnover of GDP (presumably eIF-2.GDP) on 60 S subunits and 80 S ribosomes in the absence of hemin is reduced to less than 10% the control rate, because the dissociation of eIF-2.GDP is inhibited. Additional RF increases the turnover of eIF-2.GDP on 60 S subunits and 80 S ribosomes to near the control rate by promoting dissociation of eIF-2.GDP but not eIF-2(alpha-P).GDP. Our findings suggest that eIF-2.GTP binding to and eIF-2.GDP release from 60 S subunits may normally occur and serve to promote subunit joining. The phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha inhibits polypeptide chain initiation by preventing dissociation of eIF-2.GDP from either free 60 S subunits (thus inhibiting subunit joining directly) or the 60 S subunit component of an 80 S initiation complex (thereby blocking elongation and resulting in the dissociation of the 80 S complex)."
https://openalex.org/W9626697,"Malonyl-CoA and 2-tetradecylglycidyl-CoA (TG-CoA) are potent inhibitors of mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (EC 2.3.1.21). To gain insight into their mode of action, the effects of both agents on mitochondria from rat liver and skeletal muscle were examined before and after membrane disruption with octylglucoside or digitonin. Pretreatment of intact mitochondria with TG-CoA caused almost total suppression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, with concomitant loss in malonyl-CoA binding capacity. However, subsequent membrane solubilization with octylglucoside resulted in high and equal carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity from control and TG-CoA pretreated mitochondria; neither solubilized preparation showed sensitivity to malonyl-CoA or TG-CoA. Upon removal of the detergent by dialysis the bulk of carnitine palmitoyltransferase was reincorporated into membrane vesicles, but the reinserted enzyme remained insensitive to both inhibitors. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase containing vesicles failed to bind malonyl-CoA. With increasing concentrations of digitonin, release of carnitine palmitoyltransferase paralleled disruption of the inner mitochondrial membrane, as reflected by the appearance of matrix enzymes in the soluble fraction. The profile of enzyme release was identical in control and TG-CoA pretreated mitochondria even though carnitine palmitoyltransferase I had been initially suppressed in the latter. Similar results were obtained when animals were treated with 2-tetradecylglycidate prior to the preparation of liver mitochondria. We conclude that malonyl-CoA and TG-CoA interact reversibly and irreversibly, respectively, with a common site on the mitochondrial (inner) membrane and that occupancy of this site causes inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, but not of carnitine palmitoyltransferase II. Assuming that octylglucoside and digitonin do not selectively inactivate carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, the data suggest that both malonyl-CoA and TG-CoA interact with a regulatory locus that is closely juxtaposed to but distinct from the active site of the membrane-bound enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1509132667,"We have previously described the partial purification of RNA polymerase III transcription components from Drosophila Kc cell extracts (Burke, D. J., Schaack, J., Sharp, S., and Soll, D. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 15224-15231). Here we report further physical and functional analysis of the two transcription-required fractions designated as factors B and C. Using stable complex formation-competition experiments with ordered addition of these transcription components, we have shown that factor C associates rapidly with the tRNA gene, but will not form a stable complex with the DNA in the absence of factor B. Reconstitution experiments of the individual Drosophila Kc cell factors with those from human HeLa cells demonstrated that the HeLa factor B, combined with Kc factor C, can form active transcription complexes. These now exhibit a property of the Drosophila system, a strong dependence on sequences in the 5'-flanking regions of tRNA genes. However, the Kc factor B (which has an apparent molecular weight of 260,000 as judged by gel filtration analysis) is not compatible with the HeLa factor C. These results, together with the isolation of a large complex containing all necessary transcription components, emphasize the importance of the interaction of these components for both stable complex formation and transcription initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1565760095,"We have previously shown that treatment of the human leukemic cell line K562 with the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) leads to a reduction in the expression of two surface glycoproteins, Gp-105 and glycophorin (Fukuda, M. (1981) Cancer Res. 41, 4621-4628). In this report, we examine the mechanism for reduction of glycophorin expression. By immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled proteins, we found an 11-fold reduction in the incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into glycophorin after 48 h of TPA treatment. This was found to closely correlate with a reduction in [35S]methionine incorporation, suggesting that regulation occurs at the level of protein synthesis and not glycosylation. We also found that TPA decreased the incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into glycophorin in another leukemic cell line, HEL. A time course showed that there was a 3-fold reduction in glycophorin biosynthesis as early as 4 h after TPA treatment. The level then decreased to approximately 10% of the untreated control levels after 12 h of treatment. The reduction in glycophorin biosynthesis was found to be reversible following removal of TPA from the culture medium. By immunoprecipitation of in vitro translation products directed by purified total cellular RNA, we found that there is a corresponding decrease in glycophorin mRNA activity. Glycophorin mRNA activity was extensively reduced as early as 1 h after TPA treatment and by 12 h was nearly undetectable. Interestingly, the size of the primary translation product was found to be 8 kDa larger than the fully processed apoprotein. These results are consistent with the transcriptional regulation of glycophorin expression by TPA."
https://openalex.org/W1544036606,"DL-Aminocarnitine (3-amino-4-trimethylaminobutyric acid) and acetyl-DL-aminocarnitine (3-acetamido-4-trimethylaminobutyric acid) have been synthesized and the interactions of these compounds with carnitine acetyltransferase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase investigated. As anticipated from the low group transfer potential of amides, carnitine acetyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of acetyl groups from CoASAc to aminocarnitine (Km = 3.8 mM) but does not catalyze detectable transfer from acetylaminocarnitine to CoASH. Acetyl-DL-aminocarnitine is, however, a potent competitive inhibitor of carnitine acetyltransferase (Ki = 24 microM) and is bound to carnitine acetyltransferase about 13-fold more tightly than is acetylcarnitine, with which it is isosteric. DL-Aminocarnitine and, to a lesser extent, acetyl-DL-aminocarnitine are also inhibitors of the carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity of detergent-lysed rat liver mitochondria; in the presence of 1 mM L-carnitine, 5 microM aminocarnitine inhibits palmitoyl transfer by 64%. Significant acylation of aminocarnitine by palmitoyl-CoA was not observed. Neither aminocarnitine nor acetylaminocarnitine is significantly catabolized by mice; aminocarnitine is converted to acetylaminocarnitine in vivo. Both compounds are excreted in the urine. Mice given acetylaminocarnitine catabolize [14C]acetyl-L-carnitine and [14C]palmitate to 14CO2 more slowly than do control animals. Mice given acetylaminocarnitine and then starved are found to reversibly accumulate triglycerides in their livers; mice given the inhibitor but not starved do not show this effect."
https://openalex.org/W1548903947,"A cDNA expression library of approximately 80,000 members was prepared from rat embryonic fibroblast mRNA using the plasmid expression vectors pUC8 and pUC9. Using an immunological screening procedure and 32P-labeled cDNA probes, clones encoding rat embryonic fibroblast tropomyosin 1 (TM-1) were identified and isolated. DNA sequence analysis was carried out to determine the amino acid sequence of the protein. Rat embryonic fibroblast TM-1 was found to contain 284 amino acids and is most homologous to smooth muscle alpha-tropomyosin compared with skeletal muscle alpha- and beta-tropomyosins and platelet beta-tropomyosin. Among the various tropomyosins, two regions where the greatest sequence divergence is evident are between amino acids 185 and 216 and amino acids 258 and 284. Rat embryonic fibroblast TM-1 and chicken smooth muscle alpha-tropomyosin are most closely related from amino acids 185 and 216 compared with skeletal muscle and platelet tropomyosins. In contrast, rat embryonic fibroblast TM-1, smooth muscle alpha-tropomyosin, and platelet tropomyosin are most homologous from amino acids 258 and 284 compared with skeletal muscle tropomyosins. These differences in sequences at the carboxyl-terminal region of the various tropomyosins are discussed in relation to differences in their binding to skeletal muscle troponin and its T1 fragment."
https://openalex.org/W129505242,"We have studied the aberrant splicing of a human beta thalassemia globin gene by expression of the cloned gene in HeLa cells and oligomer-directed mutagenesis. A mutation 705 nucleotides into the large intervening sequence (IVS 2) of this gene leads to missplicing in which IVS 2 is incompletely removed, via two aberrant splices, from the vast majority of transcripts. One splice is from the 5' end of IVS 2 to a normal sequence 580 nucleotides into IVS 2 and another is from the mutated site 705 nucleotides into IVS 2 to the 3' end of the IVS. To study the splicing of this gene further, a mutation was introduced into the cryptic 3' splice site at position 580. This results in the complete removal of IVS 2 despite the presence of the thalassemia mutation at 705. The reversal of abnormal splicing by a change in the cryptic splice site suggests that the two abnormal splices are subtly interdependent. Thus, single base changes within IVS 2 can drastically alter the pattern of splicing in a human beta-globin gene."
https://openalex.org/W1486756388,"Two forms of link protein, 46 and 51 kDa, are present in proteoglycan aggregates from both bovine nasal and bovine articular cartilages. Studies reported here show that the link proteins bind to concanavalin A, Lens culinaris agglutinin, Ricinus communis agglutinin, soybean agglutinin, and wheat germ agglutinin lectins. When the link proteins are eluted from these lectins with appropriate competing sugars, the 46- and the 51-kDa link proteins elute together and no separation is achieved. However, when the link proteins bound to wheat germ agglutinin are eluted with a 0 to 4 M guanidine hydrochloride linear gradient, a good separation of the 46- and 51-kDa link proteins is achieved. Wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography has been used on a preparative scale to isolate the 51-kDa link protein from mature bovine articular cartilage to homogeneity, in amounts sufficient to examine its effect on proteoglycan aggregate size and stability in sedimentation velocity studies. Proteoglycan aggregates were reassembled from proteoglycan monomers and hyaluronate in the absence of link protein, in the presence of both 46- and 51-kDa link proteins, and in the presence of the individual 51-kDa link protein. The sizes of the aggregates were compared in terms of sedimentation coefficients (s(0)20). The stability of the aggregates was compared in terms of the per cent aggregate present at pH 7 and 5. At pH 7, the sedimentation coefficients (s(0)20) of link-free aggregates, aggregates formed with both link proteins, and aggregates formed with 51-kDa link protein were 72, 93, and 112 S, respectively. Thus, the 51-kDa link protein has a pronounced effect on aggregate size. The link-free aggregate was grossly unstable, and only 36% aggregate was present at pH 5. The aggregate formed with both link proteins was effectively stabilized against dissociation and 79% aggregate was present at pH 5. The aggregate formed with 51-kDa link protein was not effectively stabilized against dissociation, and only 60% aggregate was present at pH 5. Thus, despite its pronounced effect on aggregate size, the 51-kDa link protein does not effectively stabilize the proteoglycan aggregate against dissociation. These results suggest that the 51-kDa link protein may selectively increase aggregate size, while the 46-kDa link protein may be required to effectively stabilize the proteoglycan aggregate against dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W2069822510,"The Fv-2 genotype of erythroid progenitors directly determines whether they will undergo viral-induced transformation. This conclusion was reached from studies of allophenic mice compounded from congenic C57BL/6 strains differing at Fv-2 and an enzyme marker (GPI). Infection of these Fv-2ss in equilibrium Fv-2rr mosaic animals with the polycythemic strain of Friend virus results in the development of Friend disease. Concomitant with disease symptoms is a shift in the mosaic composition of the erythrocytes in favor of those of the susceptible strain. The observed viral-induced shift in the erythrocyte composition is paralleled by a similar change in the mosaic composition of the CFU-E pool but not the primitive (d8) BFU-E pool. Thus, with regard to this particular Fv-2 phenotype (susceptibility to FV-P-induced cellular hyperplasia), Fv-2 manifests itself specifically in the erythroid lineage, either in mature (d3) BFU-E or CFU-E."
https://openalex.org/W1567078711,"Eukaryotic initiation factor 5 (eIF-5), which specifically catalyzes the joining of a 60 S ribosomal subunit to a 40 S initiation complex to form a functional 80 S initiation complex, has been purified from ribosomal salt wash proteins of calf liver. The purified factor exhibits only one polypeptide band of Mr = 62,000 following electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The native protein has a sedimentation coefficient of 4.2 S and a Stokes radius of 33 A which is consistent with eIF-5 being a monomeric protein of Mr = 58,000-62,000. Less pure preparations of eIF-5 elute in gel filtration columns with an apparent Mr of 160,000-180,000 presumably due to association of eIF-5 with other high molecular weight proteins since eIF-5 activity present in such preparations can also be shown by gel electrophoretic separation under denaturing conditions to be associated with a 62,000-dalton protein. Furthermore, eIF-5 purified from calf liver extracts with or without a number of protease inhibitors is indistinguishable with regard to molecular weight and final specific activity of purified preparations. The purified factor catalyzes the hydrolysis of GTP present in 40 S initiation complexes in the absence of 60 S ribosomal subunits. The presence of 60 S ribosomal subunits neither stimulates nor inhibits the hydrolysis of GTP. However, the factor cannot mediate 40 S or 40 + 60 S ribosome-dependent hydrolysis of GTP in the absence of Met-tRNAf or other components required for 40 S initiation complex formation. It can be calculated that 1 pmol of eIF-5 protein can catalyze the formation of at least 10 pmol of 80 S initiation complex under the conditions of in vitro initiation reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1582834666,"The formation and release of an eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-2 X GDP binary complex during eIF-5-mediated assembly of an 80 S ribosomal polypeptide chain initiation complex have been studied by sucrose gradient centrifugation analysis. Isolated 40 S initiation complex reacts with eIF-5 and 60 S ribosomal subunits to form an 80 S ribosomal initiation complex with concomitant hydrolysis of an equimolar amount of bound GTP to GDP and Pi. Sucrose gradient analysis of reaction products revealed that GDP was released from ribosomes as an eIF-2 X GDP complex. Evidence is presented that eIF-5-mediated hydrolysis releases the GTP bound to the 40 S initiation complex as an intact eIF-2 X GDP complex rather than as free GDP and eIF-2 which subsequently recombine to form the binary complex. Furthermore, formation and release of eIF-2 X GDP from the ribosomal complex do not require concomitant formation of an 80 S initiation complex since both reactions occur efficiently when the 40 S initiation complex reacts with eIF-5 in the absence of 60 S ribosomal subunits. These results, along with the observation that the 40 S initiation complex formed with the nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP, 5'-guanylylmethylene diphosphonate, can neither join a 60 S ribosomal subunit nor releases ribosome-bound eIF-2, suggest that following eIF-5-mediated hydrolysis of GTP bound to the 40 S initiation complex, both Pi and eIF-2 X GDP complex are released from ribosomes prior to the joining of 60 S ribosomal subunits to the 40 S initiation complex."
https://openalex.org/W1487333961,"Kallikrein digestion of human low density lipoproteins (LDL) has recently been shown to result in the degradation of apolipoprotein B (apo-B) into four major fragments, two of them being B-26 and B-74, which have been reported to be present in the LDL of some individuals. We studied the binding of kallikrein-treated LDL to human fibroblasts; digestion did not affect binding. Digested LDL was not taken up by macrophages, showing that it behaved like normal LDL. The activation of acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase by LDL in fibroblasts was also not altered by kallikrein digestion. When delipidated LDL was treated with kallikrein, apo-B was digested into very small fragments, indicating that kallikrein can cleave apo-B at sites other than those which result in the formation of B-26 and B-74. The partial delipidation of LDL with heptane also resulted in more extensive digestion of apo-B, although binding to cells was unaffected. These studies suggest that the cholesterol core maintains the proper orientation of apo-B in the LDL particle and that kallikrein may be used as a tool to elucidate the association of apo-B and lipids in the LDL particle."

Feeding of mevinolin and colestipol decreased the S0.5 for NADPH from 270 to 40 microM, while cholesterol feeding increased the value to 1.3 mM. Immuno-blotting analysis revealed that the Mr 100,000 form of HMG-CoA reductase predominated in cases where the S0.5 value was lowest, and the Mr 200,000 species was the major form where the S0.5 values were highest. Activation of HMG-CoA reductase by NADPH was not due to conversion of the Mr 200,000 form to the 100,000 form."
https://openalex.org/W1549453090,Abstract The Pb2+-catalyzed cleavage of tRNAPhe has been used to probe the effect of Na+ and Mg2+ binding to tRNA. Na+ is a noncompetitive inhibitor of the Pb2+-catalyzed cleavage. Millimolar Mg2+ is also a noncompetitive inhibitor. Analysis of the Mg2+ data show that at least two sites are involved in binding and that there is an interaction between the sites (cooperativity). Low-affinity Mg2+ binding is thus different from weak and strong Mg2+ binding to tRNA characterized previously. We postulate that the alterations induced by low-affinity Mg2+ binding in tRNA mimic to some extent those brought about in RNA by the interaction with a protein factor and that at appropriate [Mg2+] the whole structure of tRNA is able to respond in a concerted way to a signal from the environment such as aminoacylation or codon binding.
https://openalex.org/W1765077544,"Abstract We have examined the repertoire of cytoplasmic proteins present at different times during murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cell differentiation. Our laboratory has developed an improved differentiation system in which the use of rapidly inducing MEL subclones and culture conditions which stabilize terminally differentiated cells results in highly synchronous differentiation and the accumulation of large numbers of cells in the end stages of differentiation. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the proteins of MEL cell cytoplasm have been fractionated at different times of induction in the improved system. The protein composition of MEL cell cytoplasm changes dramatically during the differentiation program, in contrast to previously reported results. We observe patterns of changes that are consistent with alterations in the relative degradative rates as well as the relative synthetic rates of the different proteins. We find that the rate of incorporation of labeled amino acid into protein is reduced in induced cultures of MEL cells. We demonstrate that the contribution of uninduced cells to the protein patterns observed late in differentiation is minor in our system, and argue that the results previously obtained for differentiating MEL cells were influenced by the heterogeneity of the induced populations."
https://openalex.org/W1595004313,"Phenylalanine transfer RNA (tRNAPhe) of mammalian tissues contains the hypermodified guanine derivative Y (Wye) adjacent to the 3'-end of the anticodon and two O-methylated bases in the 5' portion of the anticodon loop. These positions are hypomodified in a variety of tumor cells including a mouse neuroblastoma. The normal and tumor-specific Phe-tRNAPhe iso-acceptors were prepared from mouse liver and mouse neuroblastoma cells and compared for their activity in incorporating phenylalanine into each phenylalanine site of rabbit globin in a reticulocyte cell-free protein synthesizing system. The hypomodified Phe-tRNAPhe of neuroblastoma cells is generally preferred to the fully modified tRNAPhe of liver in globin synthesis by about 15%. This preference is the same in the translation of both phenylalanine codons, UUC and UUU, but the ratios of incorporation by the Phe-tRNAPhe species vary from site to site within a 2-fold range. Only 2 of 16 phenylalanine residues are donated preferentially by the fully modified Phe-tRNAPhe. One such residue occurs in beta-42, the second of two tandem phenylalanine residues (both encoded by UUC), while the hypomodified isoacceptor is preferred in translation of the first residue. This result indicates that the translation of tandem residues is particularly affected by the tRNAs available. Since the tumor-specific hypomodified Phe-tRNAPhe is generally utilized preferntially, it appears that the bulky Y base and/or other modifications of normal tRNAPhe may modulate protein synthesis and that tumor cells may achieve a growth advantage if their tRNAPhe is hypomodified."
https://openalex.org/W65110176,"Yeast phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PRS) is shown to undergo autoaminoacylation with phenylalanine under in vitro amino acid activation conditions. Phenylalanyl adenylate enzyme complex yields a covalent phenylalanyl isopeptide exclusively with the beta subunit of the alpha 2 beta 2 enzyme. Contrary to previously reported cases of autoaminoacylation of aspartyl-tRNA synthetase and tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, the autoaminoacylation of PRS occurs under a specific set of conditions and results in the identification of only one labeled tryptic peptide on two types of high pressure liquid chromatography columns. The ability of PRS to undergo this covalent modification directly correlates with its ability to catalyze the synthesis of diadenosine 5',5'-P1,P4-tetraphosphate from enzyme-bound phenylalanyl adenylate. Both reactions require the presence of low levels of zinc or cadmium and are inhibited by tRNAPhe or by low levels of low molecular weight thiols. Since diadenosine 5',5'-P1,P4-tetraphosphate synthesis is known to be catalyzed in vivo in response to oxidation stress, it is also likely that the autoaminoacylation of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase may occur in vivo under a similar set of conditions. These reactions are thus not simply the result of accumulation of phenylalanyl adenylate and probably reflect conformational changes in the protein which are brought about by its interaction with zinc or cadmium."
https://openalex.org/W1509368850,"The characteristics of component activities in Co-eIF-2 (where eIF is eukaryotic initiation factor) protein complex have been studied. (i) At limiting concentrations, Co-eIF-2 promoted rapid GDP binding to eIF-2 and also GDP displacement from eIF-2 X GDP during ternary complex formation in the presence of GTP and Mg2+ (Co-eIF-2C activity) but did not significantly stimulate ternary complex formation by eIF-2. (ii) At higher concentrations, Co-eIF-2 significantly enhanced ternary complex formation by eIF-2 and also rendered the complex stable to aurintricarboxylic acid presumably as Co-eIF-2 became physically bound to the ternary complex (Co-eIF-2A activity). (iii) Ternary complex preformed in the presence of Co-eIF-2 and without Mg2+ dissociated upon subsequent addition of Mg2+ (Co-eIF-2B activity). This dissociation reaction was presumably due to loss of interaction of the Co-eIF-2A component in Co-eIF-2 with the ternary complex (reversal of Co-eIF-2A activity) as the complex became increasingly sensitive to aurintricarboxylic acid with increasing Mg2+ concentration. In another study, purified eIF-2 was freed of bound GDP by treatment with alkaline phosphatase and the characteristics of native and GDP-free eIF-2 were compared. (i) One mM Mg2+ inhibited (60%) ternary complex formation by native eIF-2 but not by GDP-free eIF-2. Addition of exogenous GDP rendered GDP-free eIF-2 sensitive to Mg2+ indicating that Mg2+ inhibition is due to eIF-2-bound GDP. (ii) In the presence of Mg2+, Co-eIF-2 stimulated similarly ternary and Met-tRNAf X 40 S X AUG complex formation by both native and GDP-free eIF-2. Such stimulatory activity in each case was strongly inhibited by prior phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha subunit by heme-regulated translational inhibitor. (iii) Ternary complexes preformed using either native and GDP-free eIF-2 and excess Co-eIF-2A80 in the absence of Mg2+ did not form Met-tRNAf X 40 S X AUG complex. They required trace amounts of Co-eIF-2 for such activity."
