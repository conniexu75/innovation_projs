https://openalex.org/W2092331341,"IT is certainly well known that mammalian enterochromaffin cells acquire a golden-yellow fluorescence after fixation in formalin, as stated by Drs. Shepherd, West and Erspamer1. The views of the last author on their content of enteramine (5-hydroxytryptamine), based on his extensive researches into the enterochromaffin systems of Octopoda and Muricidæ as well as Amphibia and Vertebrata, have not been substantiated histochemically, however, and a considerable body of histochemical opinion holds alternative views. According to Cordier and Lison2, the granules contained an o-diphenol with a short side-chain in the para position; Lison3 maintains this opinion. Gomori4 challenged this view, and concluded that a derivative of resorcinol (m-diphenol) was present. Lillie5, applying his new diazosafranin test, agrees entirely with Gomori."

The bacteria liberate incomplete non-infectious phage particles2. If proflavine is removed before lysis, the yield of complete phage is normal or subnormal. We have detected a mutagenic effect on phage produced in proflavine-treated bacteria."

I have now found that flight in these and other species of aphids is not possible after the first few days from the final ecdysis due to autolysis of the flight muscles. After they have lost the ability to fly the aphids may live for as long as 2–3 weeks, producing 1–4 larvæ per day."
https://openalex.org/W2044123604,"THE clinical entity originally designated as congenital hypoplastic anæmia1 and more recently termed erythrogenesis imperfecta2 is a rare type of anæmia characterized by an erythroid hypoplasia of the bone marrow, by normocytic and normochromic circulating red cells, and by the lack of response to any of the known erythropoietic agents. In the course of some metabolic studies conducted on one such patient whose anæmia was diagnosed shortly after birth and who had been studied for four years by one of the authors (G. M.), a strongly bluishfluorescent substance was noted in the urine. (This patient has been studied through the kindness of Dr. C. P. Katsampes.) This fluorescent material was identified as anthranilic acid by chromatographic methods3, isolation from the patient's urine, and by spectroscopic techniques. The R F of this fluorescent material was 0.90 in butanol : acetic acid : water, 1 : 1 : 5, in agreement with the R F of a known sample of anthranilic acid. The melting point of the material isolated (144–146°) and the absorption spectrum are identical with comparable data reported in the literature for anthranilic acid."

https://openalex.org/W2067587598,"DAVIES et al. 1 stated that : “It is widely believed that, in mammals generally, cardiac nerve cells are limited to the atria, extending at the most as far distally as the base of the ventricles near the atrio-ventricular sulcus”, and they list an impressive number of orders, including primates, to which this statement applies. They found that only in Artio-dactyla and Cetacea were ventricular nerve cells abundant, and they noted that in these the majority of the subepicardial neurons were unipolar or bipolar, with multipolar cells in a minority."

https://openalex.org/W2314864348,"WE have systematically examined a large number (175) of normal and anæmic bloods for the presence of fœtal hæmoglobin (F-Hb)1 by three methods: (a) the position of the tryptophan fine-structure band2, using the moving-plate method of Holiday3, from which the relative proportions of adult (A-Hb)1 and fœtal hæmoglobin can be estimated4 when more than 10 per cent of the latter is present, though smaller proportions cannot be detected; (b) the Rich ‘slope’ method5, using the Unicam SP.500 spectrophotometer, which has the same order of sensitivity; (c) the rate of alkaline denaturation at pH 12.8, which provides a sensitive means of detecting the more alkaline-resistant fœtal hæmoglobin6."

https://openalex.org/W2008301003,"A BACITRACIN polypeptide purified by charcoal chromatography was shown by ultracentrifugation to have a molecular weight of 1,400–1,5001. Recently, by a modified procedure using milder conditions, a peptide of higher antibiotic potency (about 60 units/mgm.) was isolated from a cruder starting material than was previously used. Except for higher activity, this peptide has essentially the same properties as that previously studied. This preparation was compared with a specimen of bacitracin A
2 kindly supplied by Dr. L. C. Craig, and appears to be identical with it. Ultracentrifugation of bacitracin A indicated a somewhat lower molecular weight (1,390), but the difference is probably not significant. The most potent fraction obtained from charcoal will therefore be referred to as bacitracin A."

https://openalex.org/W2054717746,"JORES1 considered that melanophore hormone might have a role in night vision, first because nocturnal animals have more melanophore hormone in their hypophysis than diurnal ones; secondly, because the amount of the hormone increases on dark-adaptation; and thirdly because, apart from the hypophysis, the hormone is concentrated only in the eye and thalamus. He presumed that the function of the hormone was to act as a catalyst for the regeneration of visual purple."
https://openalex.org/W1969999648,"THE principle of replacing, by means of electrolysis, the oxygen consumed in measurements of metabolism offers the threefold possibility of having a high degree of sensitivity, of controlling the phenomenon for an unlimited time and avoiding calculation entirely. An electrolytic cell (30 per cent sodium hydroxide), capable of producing oxygen, is connected by means of a tube to the thermostatic chamber in which the animal is enclosed. The chamber is provided with a mechanical system for circulating the air and absorbing carbon dioxide, and comprises a pump and a purifier. The whole, including the metabolism chamber, the pump, the purifier, the bell-jar placed over the nickel electrode, and the connecting tubes, is hermetically sealed. Measurement and integration in time of the quantity of electricity supplied by the current generator to the electrolytic cell is done electrically."

https://openalex.org/W1964746293,"POTATO virus X is well known as a source of loss to the potato industry, and schemes exist to protect newer varieties from contamination. In most countries there remain in use— often in favour–varieties that are saturated with virus X. In Australia the varieties Brownell, Carman and Delaware are in this class. To free such a variety from virus X by chemotherapy would be a significant economic advance. It would also be of importance to the general problem of plant virus control by demon- strating that, even with a stable, mosaic-type virus like potato X, there is a sufficient difference between the biosynthetic processes of the virus and of the host to make selective chemical therapy a real possibility."

https://openalex.org/W2007617908,"IT is well known that acetic acid occupies an important place in the intermediary metabolism, and that the participation of this substance in many reactions requires the activation of the acetate molecule. It is now generally considered that ‘active acetate’ corresponds to acetyl coenzyme A. Therefore, it appears reasonable to assume that a reduction of the acetylation of coenzyme A, that is, of the formation of ‘active acetate’, would lead to the accumulation of acetic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2034845903,"THE most sensitive technique available for identifying proteins consists of using the protein, by injection into a suitable animal, as an antigen, and diffusing it through a gel containing the antibody produced by the animal. The antigen and antibody combine in certain proportions, and if they are present in sufficient amounts a band of precipitate is formed. Oudin1 diffused one reactant into a gel in which the other reactant was evenly distributed. Ouchterlony2 and Elek3 diffused both components towards one another through a gel. Complex mixtures of antigens and antibodies may be analysed by means of this technique since each specific antigen–antibody system behaves independently as though the others were not present. The principles of the technique outlined below have been described by Ambrose4 and the technique has been used by Conmar Robinson to examine the diffusion of solvents through polymers5."
