https://openalex.org/W2008586773,"Tungsten carbide catalyzes the formation of water from hydrogen and oxygen at room temperature, the reduction of tungsten trioxide by hydrogen in the presence of water, and the isomerization of 2,2-dimethylpropane to 2-methylbutane. This catalytic behavior, which is typical of platinum, is not exhibited at all by tungsten. The surface electronic properties of the latter are therefore modified by carbon in such a way that they resemble those of platinum."
https://openalex.org/W1984291596,"In a recognition memory experiment, the time allowed for retrieval was controlled by using the offset of the probe as a signal to terminate retrieval and respond. The response latencies measured in the experiment indicate that this procedure effectively eliminated fast-guess strategies. The recognition signal-to-noise ratio, d', grows at a negatively accelerated rate as the allowed retrieval time is increased from 0.5 second to 1 and 2 seconds."
https://openalex.org/W2025903281,"Study of 18 Cenozoic South Pacific deep-sea cores indicates an association of glacially derived ice-rafted sands and relatively low planktonic foraminiferal diversity with cooling of the Southern Ocean during the Lower Eocene, upper Middle Eocene, and Oligocene. Increased species diversity and reduction or absence of ice-rafted sands in Lower and Middle Miocene cores indicate a warming trend that ended in the Upper Miocene. Antarctic continental glaciation appears to have prevailed throughout much of the Cenozoic."
https://openalex.org/W2047993111,"The exploitation of a bacterial food supply by a protozoan predator does not necessarily lead to the extinction of either species. Even a ""homogeneous"" experimental system contains sufficient heterogeneity (the boundaries) for avoidance strategies to evolve, which allow the populations to presist."
https://openalex.org/W2066355301,"Sulfur isotope data on hydrogen sulfide, native sulfur, and sulfates from acid hot-spring areas at Yellowstone National Park suggest that hydrogen sulfide oxidizes to sulfur abiologically, whereas sulfur undergoes biological oxidation to sulfuric acid. An exception occurs at Mammoth Hot Springs where hydrogen sulfide apparently undergoes biochemical oxidation to sulfur."
https://openalex.org/W1978134096,"The detailed archeological map of Teotihuacán, near Mexico City, demonstrates what the prehistoric city was like from its densely crowded center to its more sparsely settled peripheries. The city's population lived in crowded one-story apartment compounds, grouped into neighborhoods based at least partly on occupation. At its height the city had a minimum population of 75,000, a probable population of 125,000, and a possible population of more than 200,000. Those involved in craft production and associated activities may have numbered in the tens of thousands. The scope and intensity of urbanization at Teotihuacán is not paralleled in other contemporary New World centers. The growth potential of the obsidian and other industries, the rise of Teotihuacán as a market and trade center, and its attraction as a religious center may have combined in a self-generating process that led to the creation of Teotihuacán's unique urban society."
https://openalex.org/W2050012355,"Removal of the paired sex accessory glands associated with the posterior reproductive tract of female houseflies inhibited penetration of the eggs by sperm, but the insemination of females without these glands appeared to be unaffected. The results indicate that either the sperm are ""activated"" or the permeability of the egg membrane is altered by the secretion of the accessory glands before fertilization occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1963809146,"Evidence is presented for a novel mechanism mediating the auditory sense in the Choerocampinae (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae). Vibrations in the scale-free medial wall of the enlarged labial palp segment are transmitted by contact to the distal lobe of the pilifer, a derivative of the labrum, and are there transduced into afferent impulses in the labral nerve."
https://openalex.org/W2026155424,"The lattice misfit between ice and silver iodide can be reduced by partial substitution of copper atoms for silver atoms in the silver iodide lattice. The best crystal match is obtained with a composition of CuI-3AgI, which corresponds to the most active silver-copper iodide nucleation catalyst."

https://openalex.org/W1982656281,"California scorpionfish, Scorpaena guttata, were implanted with a pair of thermodes which straddled the anterior brainstem. When the fish were in water of about 20°C, warming the thermodes to temperatures above 20°C caused a proportional increase in the ventilatory minute volume. Cooling the thermodes below 20°C caused a proportional decrease in the ventilatory minute volume. It is concluded that the anterior brainstem temperature provides an important input to the respiratory control center in teleost fish."
https://openalex.org/W2088944015,"A radar interferometer was used to map unambiguously the surface reflectivity of Venus in the polarized mode at a wavelength of 70 centimeters. The observed region extended from 260 degrees to 30 degrees in longitude and from -60 degrees to 50 degrees in latitude with a surface resolution of approximately 3 degrees by 3 degrees . The result agrees well in most respects with earlier maps made elsewhere at shorter wavelengths and, in addition, discloses a number of new ""features."""

https://openalex.org/W2041258510,"It is proposed that earthquake waves energize the geomagnetic dynamo. Fluid motions generated by earthquakes may have enough energy to be in equipartition with fields as large as 100 gauss. Seismic waves from meteoritic impacts with energies sufficient to reverse the field occur every 170,000 years."

https://openalex.org/W2069461603,"Comparison of pictures of the lunar surface taken 31 months apart by Surveyor 3 and Apollo 12 show only one change in the areas disturbed by Surveyor: a 2-millimeter particle, in a footpad imprint, that may have fallen in from the rim or been kicked in by an approaching astronaut. Vertical walls 6 centimeters high did not collapse and dark ejecta remained dark. No meteorite craters as large as 1.5 millimeters in diameter were seen on a smooth soil surface 20 centimeters in diameter; this indicates a micrometeoroid flux lower than 4 x 10(-7) micrometeoroids per square meter-second at an energy equivalent to about 3 x 10(-8) gram at 20 kilometers per second. This flux is near the lower limit of previous determinations."
https://openalex.org/W2088004265,"Two portable seismic stations and a fixed array of five seismometers were used to record aftershocks in the vicinity of Managua, Nicaragua, after the earthquake of 23 December 1972. Approximately 3000 aftershocks were recorded during a 20-day period in January 1973. Left lateral motion along at least two faults, both trending N40°E, is inferred from the seismic data. This is in good agreement with dislocations mapped at the surface in Managua. The data suggest that the shallow earthquakes of the Managua region are a consequence of north-south compressional stresses and east-west tensional stresses. This is consistent with regional plate movements deduced in other investigations."

https://openalex.org/W2003087164,"Measurements of broadband radio noise in the range 73 to 440 megahertz were made over several small Illinois cities during August, September, and December 1972. Results for cities with a population larger than 25,000 are presented as brightness temperatures between 2400 and 9600 degrees Kelvin. Even the smallest villages produce significant noise pollution. There is considerable diurnal variation and some evidence for seasonal variation."

https://openalex.org/W1971735029,"A policy framework for analyzing educational research and development has been proposed. The framework consists of five primary elements focusing on the contexts in which educational R & D operates, its goals, its characteristics, its manpower, and its decision structures. These five primary elements interact to produce two secondary elements concerned with priorities and objectives, and strategies and tactics. The framework was applied to three current policy proposals in educational R & D including directed R & D programming in the U.S. Office of Education, the request for funds for experimental schools, and the proposed National Institute of Education. Rigorous application of the framework to major policy questions such as these three can help us examine issues before they arise. It can help prevent errors. Its application can provide greater assurance that primary, secondary, and tertiary consequences-those that arise from the interaction of the consequences we most directly perceive-will receive examination. This kind of consideration can help produce the desirable and intended effects and avoid the detrimental consequences of unanticipated impacts in unintended areas."
