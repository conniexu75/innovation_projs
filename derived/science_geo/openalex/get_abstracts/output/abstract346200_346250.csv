https://openalex.org/W2036423640,"Pulsar surveys offer a rare opportunity to monitor the radio sky for impulsive burst-like events with millisecond durations. We analyzed archival survey data and found a 30-jansky dispersed burst, less than 5 milliseconds in duration, located 3° from the Small Magellanic Cloud. The burst properties argue against a physical association with our Galaxy or the Small Magellanic Cloud. Current models for the free electron content in the universe imply that the burst is less than 1 gigaparsec distant. No further bursts were seen in 90 hours of additional observations, which implies that it was a singular event such as a supernova or coalescence of relativistic objects. Hundreds of similar events could occur every day and, if detected, could serve as cosmological probes."
https://openalex.org/W2147574419,"Superconducting circuits are promising candidates for constructing quantum bits (qubits) in a quantum computer; single-qubit operations are now routine, and several examples of two-qubit interactions and gates have been demonstrated. These experiments show that two nearby qubits can be readily coupled with local interactions. Performing gate operations between an arbitrary pair of distant qubits is highly desirable for any quantum computer architecture, but has not yet been demonstrated. An efficient way to achieve this goal is to couple the qubits to a 'quantum bus', which distributes quantum information among the qubits. Here we show the implementation of such a quantum bus, using microwave photons confined in a transmission line cavity, to couple two superconducting qubits on opposite sides of a chip. The interaction is mediated by the exchange of virtual rather than real photons, avoiding cavity-induced loss. Using fast control of the qubits to switch the coupling effectively on and off, we demonstrate coherent transfer of quantum states between the qubits. The cavity is also used to perform multiplexed control and measurement of the qubit states. This approach can be expanded to more than two qubits, and is an attractive architecture for quantum information processing on a chip."
https://openalex.org/W2140869203,"Structural variation of the genome involves kilobase- to megabase-sized deletions, duplications, insertions, inversions, and complex combinations of rearrangements. We introduce high-throughput and massive paired-end mapping (PEM), a large-scale genome-sequencing method to identify structural variants (SVs) ∼3 kilobases (kb) or larger that combines the rescue and capture of paired ends of 3-kb fragments, massive 454 sequencing, and a computational approach to map DNA reads onto a reference genome. PEM was used to map SVs in an African and in a putatively European individual and identified shared and divergent SVs relative to the reference genome. Overall, we fine-mapped more than 1000 SVs and documented that the number of SVs among humans is much larger than initially hypothesized; many of the SVs potentially affect gene function. The breakpoint junction sequences of more than 200 SVs were determined with a novel pooling strategy and computational analysis. Our analysis provided insights into the mechanisms of SV formation in humans."

https://openalex.org/W2044811975,"As with classical information processing, a quantum information processor requires bits (qubits) that can be independently addressed and read out, long-term memory elements to store arbitrary quantum states, and the ability to transfer quantum information through a coherent communication bus accessible to a large number of qubits. Superconducting qubits made with scalable microfabrication techniques are a promising candidate for the realization of a large-scale quantum information processor. Although these systems have successfully passed tests of coherent coupling for up to four qubits, communication of individual quantum states between superconducting qubits via a quantum bus has not yet been realized. Here, we perform an experiment demonstrating the ability to coherently transfer quantum states between two superconducting Josephson phase qubits through a quantum bus. This quantum bus is a resonant cavity formed by an open-ended superconducting transmission line of length 7 mm. After preparing an initial quantum state with the first qubit, this quantum information is transferred and stored as a nonclassical photon state of the resonant cavity, then retrieved later by the second qubit connected to the opposite end of the cavity. Beyond simple state transfer, these results suggest that a high-quality-factor superconducting cavity could also function as a useful short-term memory element. The basic architecture presented here can be expanded, offering the possibility for the coherent interaction of a large number of superconducting qubits."

https://openalex.org/W2006270623,"The possibility of arbitrarily “adding” and “subtracting” single photons to and from a light field may give access to a complete engineering of quantum states and to fundamental quantum phenomena. We experimentally implemented simple alternated sequences of photon creation and annihilation on a thermal field and used quantum tomography to verify the peculiar character of the resulting light states. In particular, as the final states depend on the order in which the two actions are performed, we directly observed the noncommutativity of the creation and annihilation operators, one of the cardinal concepts of quantum mechanics, at the basis of the quantum behavior of light. These results represent a step toward the full quantum control of a field and may provide new resources for quantum information protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2157137464,"One motivation in the study of development is the discovery of mechanisms that may guide evolutionary change. Here we report how development governs relative size and number of cheek teeth, or molars, in the mouse. We constructed an inhibitory cascade model by experimentally uncovering the activator-inhibitor logic of sequential tooth development. The inhibitory cascade acts as a ratchet that determines molar size differences along the jaw, one effect being that the second molar always makes up one-third of total molar area. By using a macroevolutionary test, we demonstrate the success of the model in predicting dentition patterns found among murine rodent species with various diets, thereby providing an example of ecologically driven evolution along a developmentally favoured trajectory. In general, our work demonstrates how to construct and test developmental rules with evolutionary predictability in natural systems."

https://openalex.org/W2035262366,"Modifications on histones control important biological processes through their effects on chromatin structure. Methylation at lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4) is found at the 5' end of active genes and contributes to transcriptional activation by recruiting chromatin-remodelling enzymes. An adjacent arginine residue (H3R2) is also known to be asymmetrically dimethylated (H3R2me2a) in mammalian cells, but its location within genes and its function in transcription are unknown. Here we show that H3R2 is also methylated in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and by using an antibody specific for H3R2me2a in a chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip analysis we determine the distribution of this modification on the entire yeast genome. We find that H3R2me2a is enriched throughout all heterochromatic loci and inactive euchromatic genes and is present at the 3' end of moderately transcribed genes. In all cases the pattern of H3R2 methylation is mutually exclusive with the trimethyl form of H3K4 (H3K4me3). We show that methylation at H3R2 abrogates the trimethylation of H3K4 by the Set1 methyltransferase. The specific effect on H3K4me3 results from the occlusion of Spp1, a Set1 methyltransferase subunit necessary for trimethylation. Thus, the inability of Spp1 to recognize H3 methylated at R2 prevents Set1 from trimethylating H3K4. These results provide the first mechanistic insight into the function of arginine methylation on chromatin."

https://openalex.org/W2003953346,"The presence of workers that forgo reproduction and care for their siblings is a defining feature of eusociality and a major challenge for evolutionary theory. It has been proposed that worker behavior evolved from maternal care behavior. We explored this idea by studying gene expression in the primitively eusocial wasp Polistes metricus. Because little genomic information existed for this species, we used 454 sequencing to generate 391,157 brain complementary DNA reads, resulting in robust hits to 3017 genes from the honey bee genome, from which we identified and assayed orthologs of 32 honey bee behaviorally related genes. Wasp brain gene expression in workers was more similar to that in foundresses, which show maternal care, than to that in queens and gynes, which do not. Insulin-related genes were among the differentially regulated genes, suggesting that the evolution of eusociality involved major nutritional and reproductive pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2028155164,"The oxygen fugacity f(O2)of the Earth's mantle is one of the fundamental variables in mantle petrology. Through ferric-ferrous iron and carbon-hydrogen-oxygen equilibria, f(O2) influences the pressure-temperature positions of mantle solidi and compositions of small-degree mantle melts. Among other parameters, f(O2) affects the water storage capacity and rheology of the mantle. The uppermost mantle, as represented by samples and partial melts, is sufficiently oxidized to sustain volatiles, such as H2O and CO2, as well as carbonatitic melts, but it is not known whether the shallow mantle is representative of the entire upper mantle. Using high-pressure experiments, we show here that large parts of the asthenosphere are likely to be metal-saturated. We found that pyroxene and garnet synthesized at >7 GPa in equilibrium with metallic Fe can incorporate sufficient ferric iron that the mantle at >250 km depth is so reduced that an (Fe,Ni)-metal phase may be stable. Our results indicate that the oxidized nature of the upper mantle can no longer be regarded as being representative for the Earth's upper mantle as a whole and instead that oxidation is a shallow phenomenon restricted to an upper veneer only about 250 km in thickness."
https://openalex.org/W2019111332,"Establishing what caused Earth's largest climatic changes in the past requires a precise knowledge of both the forcing and the regional responses. We determined the chronology of high- and low-latitude climate change at the last glacial termination by radiocarbon dating benthic and planktonic foraminiferal stable isotope and magnesium/calcium records from a marine core collected in the western tropical Pacific. Deep-sea temperatures warmed by ∼2°C between 19 and 17 thousand years before the present (ky B.P.), leading the rise in atmospheric CO 2 and tropical–surface-ocean warming by ∼1000 years. The cause of this deglacial deep-water warming does not lie within the tropics, nor can its early onset between 19 and 17 ky B.P. be attributed to CO 2 forcing. Increasing austral-spring insolation combined with sea-ice albedo feedbacks appear to be the key factors responsible for this warming."
https://openalex.org/W1968157888,"NAD+-dependent Sir2 family deacetylases and insulin signaling pathway are both conserved across species to regulate aging process. The interplay between these two genetic programs is investigated in this study. Protein deacetylase activity of SirT1, the mammalian homologue of Sir2, was suppressed through either nicotinamide treatment or RNA interference in several cell lines, and these cells displayed impaired insulin responses. Suppression of SirT1 activity also selectively inhibited insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS-2), whereas it had minimal effect on that of IRS-1. Further analyses showed that both IRS-1 and IRS-2 interacted with SirT1, and the acetylation level of IRS-2 was down-regulated by insulin treatment. Inhibition of SirT1 activity prevented deacetylation and insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2. Mutations of four lysine residues to alanine in IRS-2 protein, on the other hand, led to its reduced basal level acetylation and insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. These results suggest a possible regulatory effect of SirT1 on insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2, a vital step in insulin signaling pathway, through deacetylation of IRS-2 protein. More importantly, this study may imply a pathway through which Sir2 family protein deacetylases and insulin signaling pathway jointly regulate various metabolic processes, including aging and diabetes.

Calorie restriction, the only physiological method known so far to extend lifespan in animals ranging from Caenorhabditis elegans to mammals, is associated with global metabolic changes, including reduced insulin level, increased gluconeogenesis, and reduced lipid metabolism. The identification of Sir2 as the mediator of calorie restriction on lifespan regulation is a major breakthrough in understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the aging process (1Fontana L. Meyer T.E. Klein S. Holloszy J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6659-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 2Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). Sir2 and its mammalian counterpart, SirT1, belong to a family of NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases. Sir2 is actively involved in lifespan regulation in C. elegans, yeast, and Drosophila. Disruption of Sir2 gene leads to a reduced lifespan, whereas overexpression of Sir2 leads to significant lifespan extension in these species (2Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). In the mammalian system, SirT1 has been involved in multiple metabolic processes including glucose homeostasis (3Rodgers J.T. Lerin C. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Spiegelman B.M. Puigserver P. Nature. 2005; 434: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar), insulin secretion (4Bordone L. Motta M.C. Picard F. Robinson A.

Leid M. McBurney M.W. Guarente L. Nature. 2004; 429: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). However, its role in lifespan regulation remains ambiguous. Insulin signaling pathway is also actively involved in the aging process (7Tatar M. Bartke A. Antebi A. Science. 2003; 299: 1346-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). As a critical component of overall energy homeostasis, insulin signaling pathway has been well studied, and the key steps have been characterized (8Kahn C.R. Vicent D. Doria A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1996; 47: 509-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Insulin signaling pathway is initiated by auto tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor upon insulin binding, and subsequently tyrosine phosphorylations of several key adaptor proteins including insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) 2The abbreviations used are: IRS-1, insulin receptor (IR) substrate 1; RNAi, RNA interference; SC cells, stable control cells; SS cells, stable SirT1 cells; Luc, luciferase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. and IRS-2. The phosphorylated IRS proteins further transmit insulin signaling to downstream events, mainly through two kinase cascades, the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt cascade. Genetic studies using C. elegans as a model system demonstrate a tight connection between insulin signaling pathway and aging. Mutations at several key components of insulin signaling pathway, including daf-2 (Insulin receptor), Age-1 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), and daf-16 (Foxo proteins), all significantly extend the lifespan of C. elegans (7Tatar M. Bartke A. Antebi A. Science. 2003; 299: 1346-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Likewise, inactivation of insulin receptor in adipose tissue leads to extended lifespan in mice (9Bluher M. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Science. 2003; 299: 572-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar), and deletion of Klotho, a protein potently inactivating insulin receptor activity in cell culture studies, accelerates aging process in mutant mice (10Kurosu H. Yamamoto M. Clark J.D. Pastor J.V. Nandi A. Gurnani P. McGuinness O.P. Chikuda H. Yamaguchi M. Kawaguchi H. Shimomura I. Takayama Y. Herz J. Kahn C.R. Rosenblatt K.P. Kuro-o M. Science. 2005; 309: 1829-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar). In this laboratory resveratrol, a chemical compound known to extend lifespan in several species including C. elegans, yeast, and Drosophila, has also been demonstrated to inhibit insulin signaling pathway in cell culture studies (11Zhang J. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These observations support a vital role of insulin signaling pathway in aging process. The associations of both the insulin signaling pathway and the Sir2 family protein deacetylases with the aging process raise an important question; do these two pathways independently or jointly regulate aging process? In other words, is there any direct association between these two pathways? This question is explored in this study, and the results provide direct evidence supporting a novel role of SirT1 in regulating insulin-signaling pathway in mammalian cells. General Reagents—Various cell culture reagents, including Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, M199 medium, penicillin/streptomycin, and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Fisher. Insulin was obtained from Sigma. Antibodies against p44/42 MAPK, phospho-AKT (serine 473 and threonine 308), AKT, and acetylated lysine polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Monoclone FLAG antibody (M2) and phospho-p44/42 MAPK monoclonal antibody were obtained from Sigma. Anti-acetyl lysine 4G12 and anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibodies were obtained from Millipore (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies against insulin receptor β, retinoblastoma, were obtained from BD Biosciences. Antibodies against SirT1, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-1, IRS-1, IRS-2, normal mouse IgG, normal rabbit IgG, and protein A/G plus beads were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Cell Culture—H4IIE, HEK293 cells, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Rat primary hepatocytes were isolated as described previously (11Zhang J. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and set up in M199 medium supplemented with 100 nm dexamethasone, 100 nm triiodothyronine, and1nm insulin overnight before they were changed into M199 medium supplemented with 100 nm dexamethasone for further treatments. Cell Fractionation—HEK293 cells were seeded at 3 × 106/100-mm dish, and grew in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum for 2 days. Cells were serum-starved overnight, and 3 dishes of cells were pooled together and resuspended in 0.2 ml of hypotonic buffer A (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose supplemented with protease inhibitors) and passed through a 22.5-gauge needle 15 times before they were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 7 min at 4 °C. The 1000 × g pellet was resuspended in 0.1 ml of buffer B (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 2.5% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2 supplemented with protease inhibitors), rotated at 4 °C for 1 h, and centrifuged at 1 × 105 × g for 30 min in a Beckman TLA 100.2 rotor. The resulted supernatant was designated as the nuclear fraction. In the meantime, the supernatant from original 1000 × g centrifugation was re-centrifuged at 8000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 15 min, and the resulted supernatant is designated as the cytosolic fraction. The 8000 × g pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of buffer A and was designated as the membrane fraction. Plasmid Construction—Full-length IRS-1 and IRS-2 cDNAs were PCR-amplified from mouse cDNA derived from mouse liver total RNA. PCR products were verified by DNA sequencing and inserted into a pcDNA 3.1(+) plasmid. Three tandem copies of FLAG epitope were inserted into mouse IRS-1 or IRS-2 N-terminal sequence. Mouse SirT1 cDNA was obtained from Millipore, and five tandem copies of Myc epitope were inserted into SirT1 C-terminal sequence. For construction of constitutive expressed RNA interference (RNAi) constructs, RNAi-Ready pSIREN-RetroQ plasmid from Clontech was used by following the manufacturer's instructions using a targeting sequence against SirT1 (pSIREN-SirT1) or against luciferase, pSIREN-Luciferase (11Zhang J. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). FLAG-IRS-2 deletion mutants were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene by using primers joining the flanking sequences of the both end of the deleted sequence using FLAG-IRS-2 construct as template. For creation of FLAG-IRS-2 (K4A) mutants, three rounds of site-directed mutagenesis were conducted using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit by first creating k289A/k292A double mutant using FLAG-IRS-2 construct as template. The double mutant was used as a template next to create triple mutant K289A/K292A/K412A mutant, and finally the triple mutant was used as template to create K289A/K292A/K412A/K118A mutant. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—For H4IIE cells, cells were seeded at 2 × 106/60 mm dish for 1 day and serum-starved overnight before they were treated with various agents, as indicated in the figure legends. For HEK293 cells, these cells were set up at 0.6 × 106/60-mm dishes and transfected with plasmid DNA for 48 h using FuGENE 6 transfection regents. Cells were serum-starved overnight before they were treated with various agents, as indicated in the figure legends. After treatment, cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Na2P2O7, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (100 mm NaF, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin) by pipetting up and down 50 times. Supernatants were collected after 5 min of microcentrifugation at 8000 × g for Western blot analysis. For immunoprecipitation, equal amount of cell lysates were preincubated with protein A/G plus beads for 30 min at 4 °C under constant agitation, and the resulting supernatants were transferred into fresh tubes and incubated with primary antibody for another hour followed by the addition of 60 μl of protein A/G plus beads for an additional 1 h. Protein A/G plus beads were collected at 1000 × g for 1 min using microcentrifugation, washed several times with lysis buffer, and subjected to Western blot analysis. For Western blot analysis, immunoprecipitates or total cell lysates were resuspended in sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with bromphenol blue) and heated for 5 min at 75 °C. Proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent from Invitrogen following the manufacturer's instructions. An equal amount of RNA was resuspended into RNA loading buffer (Sigma), separated by 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+). The cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primer labeling kit from Amersham Biosciences. Hybridization was performed at 65 °C in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (BD Biosciences Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were exposed to x-ray film at either room temperature or -80 °C for 16 h. Establishing Stable Cell Lines—H4IIE cells were transfected with 0.1 μg/100-mm dish pSIREN-RetroQ plasmid constitutively producing small interfering RNA against either luciferase (pSIREN-Luciferase) or the SirT1 coding sequence (pSIREN-SirT1) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent for 48 h. Stable clones were isolated by puromycin selection at 6 μg/ml. The stable clones were isolated based on Northern blot analysis using specific probe against SirT1. For establishing HEK293 stable clones, cells were transfected with pSIREN-Luciferase or pSIREN-SirT1 for 48 h using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent, and stable clones were isolated using puromycin selection at 1 μg/ml. The stable clones were isolated based on Western blot analysis using SirT1 antibody from Santa Cruz. In Vitro Deacetylation—HEK293 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg/60-mm dish FLAG-IRS-2 construct using FuGENE 6 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, cells were serum-starved overnight before total cell lysates were prepared for immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibody. Meanwhile, untransfected HEK293 cells were also serum-starved overnight and treated with insulin for 10 min. Endogenous SirT1 protein was immunoprecipitated using rabbit anti-SirT1 antibody from total cell lysates and washed several times in the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.4% Triton X-100). The immunoprecipitated agarose beads were separated into deacetylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), treated with and without β-NAD+, and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Total samples were quickly spun using a microcentrifuge and resuspended in sample buffer for Western blot analysis. Several small chemical compounds, including nicotinamide and splitomycin, have been demonstrated to potently inhibit protein deacetylase activity of SirT1 (12Bitterman K.J. Anderson R.M. Cohen H.Y. Latorre-Esteves M. Sinclair D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45099-45107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). These compounds were first used to treat H4IIE cells to investigate their effects on insulin-induced MAPK and Akt activations (Fig. 1A). Insulin treatment alone induced strong Akt activation, demonstrated here by phosphorylations at both threonine 308 and serine 473 sites of Akt protein. Coincubation of either nicotinamide at 6 mm or splitomycin at 100 μm for 6 h significantly inhibited insulin-induced Akt phosphorylations at both sites. However, under the same condition, these compounds had minimal effects on insulin-induced MAPK activation, demonstrated here by phosphorylations of p42/p44 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) proteins. A dose response study of the nicotinamide effect on insulin-induced MAPK and Akt activations was shown in Fig. 1B. Cells were treated with nicotinamide ranging from 0.3 to 10 mm for 6 h, and Western blot analysis showed that although MAPK activation was not affected by nicotinamide treatment at all, insulin-induced Akt activation was slightly inhibited with 3 mm nicotinamide and significantly inhibited with 10 mm nicotinamide. To rule out the possibility that these results were due to cell line specificity, similar experiments were also conducted using rat primary hepatocytes (Fig. 1C) and HeLa cells (data not shown). In these cells nicotinamide significantly inhibited insulin-induced Akt activation but had minimal impact on insulin-induced MAPK activation. The nicotinamide effect on the insulin regulation of downstream target gene expressions at the transcriptional level was also investigated (Fig. 1D). Consistent with what was observed in SirT1 null cells (13Motta M.C. Divecha N. Lemieux M. Kamel C. Chen D. Gu W. Bultsma Y. McBurney M. Guarente L. Cell. 2004; 116: 551-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar), nicotinamide treatment led to a significantly increased mRNA level of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase at the basal state but had little effect on the suppressive effect of insulin on phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase expression. Nicotinamide treatment also clearly suppressed insulin-induced up-regulation of fatty acid synthase mRNA level. The mRNA level of cyclophilin was measured as the loading control in this experiment. These results suggest that inhibition of SirT1 activity directly interferes with insulin signaling pathway at both protein and mRNA levels. SirT1 activity was also inhibited through reducing SirT1 expression level by RNAi, and its effect on insulin signaling pathway was examined to avoid any possible side effects of chemical compound treatments. Several H4IIE stable clones carrying pSIREN-RetroQ plasmid producing either small interfering RNA against luciferase (pSIREN-Luciferase) or SirT1 (pSIREN-SirT1) were isolated through puromycin selection, and insulin-induced MAPK and Akt activations were examined in these cells. One typical experiment was shown in Fig. 2A. Clone Luc was isolated from cells transfected with pSIREN-Luciferase, whereas clones 1 and 2 were derived from cells transfected with pSIREN-SirT1. In all three clones insulin treatment led to potent MAPK activation. Akt kinase was also potently activated by insulin treatment in Luc and clone 1, but not clone 2, as quantified in Fig. 2A. Northern blot analysis showed that the SirT1 mRNA level was only reduced in clone 2, but not in clone 1, thus further supporting the observation that SirT1 activity was necessary for insulin-induced Akt activation. The expression level of cyclophilin was used as the loading control. For the convenience of description, the stable cells carrying pSIREN-Luciferase were named SC (stable control) cells, whereas clone 2 or any clone where SirT1 mRNA levels was significantly reduced was named SS (Stable SirT1) cells. Insulin signaling pathway was further dissected to identify the underlying mechanism of the suppressive effect of reduced SirT1 activity on insulin-induced Akt activation. One critical step in insulin signaling pathway is the tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor (IR), which further phosphorylates tyrosine residues in both IRS-1 and IRS-2. Therefore, the tyrosine phosphorylation statuses of IR, IRS-1, and IRS-2 were compared between SC and SS cells upon insulin treatment (Fig. 3A). Insulin treatment led to strong tyrosine phosphorylations of IR, IRS-1, and IRS-2 in SC cells. However, in SS cells, whereas IR and IRS-1 remained to be strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated, the tyrosine phosphorylation level of IRS-2 was significantly reduced. Similar results were obtained using H4IIE cells treated with 6 mm nicotinamide (data not shown). The impaired tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 protein in SS cells can be observed within 5 min of insulin treatment (supplemental Fig. 1). These experiments indicate that SirT1 activity may be required for insulin-induced IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation. To facilitate further investigation of the molecular mechanism underlying the regulatory effect of SirT1 on insulin-induced IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, IRS-1- and IRS-2-coding sequences were PCR-amplified from mouse liver cDNA and were used to create expression constructs with N-terminal FLAG epitope. These DNA constructs were overexpressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3, B and C). The transfected cells were serum-starved overnight with or without coincubation of 6 mm nicotinamide and treated with insulin for 10 min. Consistent with the result in H4IIE cells, insulin treatment clearly led to potent tyrosine phosphorylations of both FLAG-IRS-1 and FLAG-IRS-2 proteins. However, although nicotinamide had minimal effect on insulin-induced IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3B), it reduced insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 protein significantly (Fig. 3C). Thus, FLAG-tagged IRS-2 in HEK293 cells responded similarly to nicotinamide treatment as endogenous IRS-2 protein. The requirement of SirT1 deacetylase activity for insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 raises a possibility that acetylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 might be inversely related, and deacetylation of IRS-2 by SirT1 might be a prerequisite for insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2. An obstacle to this hypothesis is that SirT1 protein is generally regarded as a nuclear protein, whereas IRS-2 protein is reported to be a cytoplasmic protein (14Inoue G. Cheatham B. Emkey R. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11548-11555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The reported substrates of SirT1 are all but one cytoplasmic proteins (13Motta M.C. Divecha N. Lemieux M. Kamel C. Chen D. Gu W. Bultsma Y. McBurney M. Guarente L.

A. 2006; 103: 10230-10235Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Therefore, cellular localization of SirT1 was first examined in HEK293 cells. Cell fractionation studies showed that SirT1 protein was presented in both nuclear and cytosolic fractions (Fig. 4A). As experimental controls, two nuclear proteins, retinoblastoma protein and cAMP responsive element-binding protein, were detected mainly in nuclear fraction, whereas tubulin, a cytosolic protein, was detected mainly in cytosolic fraction. Next, the interaction between IRS-2 and SirT1 proteins was examined using epitope-tagged proteins in HEK293 cells. An expression vector carrying the mouse SirT1 coding sequence with a C-terminal Myc tag was constructed and transfected with and without FLAG-tagged IRS-2 construct. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-IRS-2 protein clearly pulled down SirT1-Myc protein (Fig. 4B, upper panel), whereas immunoprecipitation of SirT1-Myc protein also pulled down FLAG-IRS-2 protein simultaneously (Fig. 4B, lower panel). This result was confirmed using endogenous proteins in HEK293 cells. Cells were serum-starved overnight, and IRS-2 protein was immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal anti-IRS-2 antibody. Normal rabbit IgG was used as negative control. Western blot analysis using SirT1 antibody showed that IRS-2 protein interacted with SirT1 protein in vivo (Fig. 4C). The interaction between IRS-1 and SirT1 was also examined in HEK293 cells using epitope-tagged proteins, as demonstrated in Fig. 4D. Clearly, IRS-1 interacted equally well with SirT1 as IRS-2. To investigate the acetylation status of IRS-2 protein, FLAG-tagged IRS-2 protein was expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5A) and serum-starved overnight with and without co-treatment of 10 mm nicotinamide. These cells were treated with insulin for 10 min and harvested for immunoprecipitation using monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody. Normal mouse IgG was used as negative control. Western blot analysis showed that immunoprecipitated FLAG-IRS-2 protein was acetylated at the basal level (compare lane 1 with lane 2), and treatment of insulin significantly reduced the acetylation level of FLAG-IRS-2 (compare lane 2 and lane 3). Treatment of nicotinamide overnight, on the other hand, prevented insulin-induced deacetylation of IRS-2 protein (compare lane 3 with lane 5). Next, endogenous IRS-2 protein was immunoprecipitated from H4IIE cells with and without insulin treatment using polyclonal anti-IRS-2 antibody alongside normal rabbit IgG as negative control. The acetylation status of IRS-2 protein was examined, and again, IRS-2 was acetylated at the basal level, and insulin treatment led to reduced acetylation level of IRS-2 protein. Overall, these results suggest that IRS-2 protein is acetylated at basal state, and its acetylation level is down-regulated by insulin. Both IRS-1 and IRS-2 interacted equally well with SirT1. To understand why insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylations of IRS-1 and IRS-2 responded differently to reduced SirT1 activity (Fig. 3), the acetylation status of IRS-1 was also examined alongside with that of IRS-2 in HEK293 cells using FLAG-tagged proteins (Fig. 5C). Consistent with previous results, FLAG-IRS-2 protein was acetylated at the basal level, and insulin treatment led to reduced acetylation level of FLAG-IRS-2. On the other hand, although the protein amount of IRS-1 is higher than that of IRS-2, the acetylation level of FLAG-IRS-1 protein was too low to be detected under the same conditions. Longer exposure showed that IRS-1 was weakly acetylated, and its acetylation was not regulated by insulin (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that insulin-induced IRS-2 deacetylation is accountable for the regulatory effect of SirT1 on insulin-induced IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation. The direct involvement of SirT1 in insulin-induced IRS-2 deacetylation was also investigated in an in vitro deacetylation assay (Fig. 5D). FLAG-tagged IRS-2 protein was expressed in HEK293 cells and immunoprecipitated from total cell lysates using monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody. Endogenous SirT1 protein was also immunoprecipitated from insulin-treated HEK293 cells. The immunoprecipitated FLAG-IRS-2 protein and SirT1 protein were set up as indicated in Fig. 5D for 2 h at 37 °C, and the acetylation level of FLAG-IRS-2 protein was examined. The addition of SirT1 protein alone had a minimal effect on the acetylation level of FLAG-IRS-2 protein. However, the addition of SirT1 protein in the presence of 5 mm β-NAD+ significantly reduced acetylation level of FLAG-IRS-2 to undetectable level under the same conditions (Fig. 5D, compare lane 3 with lane 4). This experiment suggests that IRS-2 protein may be a substrate of SirT1 protein deacetylase, and SirT1 is responsible for insulin-induced IRS-2 deacetylation in vivo. The direct connection between IRS-2 acetylation and tyrosine phosphorylation was further demonstrated in stable clones derived from HEK293 cells transfected with either pSIREN-Luciferase or pSIREN-SirT1. These cells were transfected with FLAG-IRS-2 construct, as demonstrated in Fig. 5E. FLAG-IRS-2 protein was immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody, and normal mouse IgG was used as the negative control in Fig. 5E, lane 1. The acetylation and tyrosine phosphorylation levels of FLAG-IRS-2 protein were compared in both clones with and without insulin treatment. Compared with cells with normal SirT1 expression, the basal acetylation level of FLAG-IRS-2 was increased, and insulin-induced deacetylation of FLAG-IRS-2 was inhibited in"

Whether or not in vivo gene silencing by synthetic siRNA can disrupt the endogenous microRNA (miRNA) pathway remains to be addressed. Here we show that effective target-gene silencing in the mouse and hamster liver can be achieved by systemic administration of synthetic siRNA without any demonstrable effect on miRNA levels or activity. Indeed, siRNA targeting two hepatocyte-specific genes (apolipoprotein B and factor VII) that achieved efficient (approximately 80%) silencing of messenger RNA transcripts and a third irrelevant siRNA control were administered to mice without significant changes in the levels of three hepatocyte-expressed miRNAs (miR-122, miR-16 and let-7a) or an effect on miRNA activity. Moreover, multiple administrations of an siRNA targeting the hepatocyte-expressed gene Scap in hamsters achieved long-term mRNA silencing without significant changes in miR-122 levels. This study advances the use of siRNAs as safe and effective tools to silence gene transcripts in animal studies, and supports the continued advancement of RNA interference therapeutics using synthetic siRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2017119638,"At ambient conditions, the light alkali metals are free-electron-like crystals with a highly symmetric structure. However, they were found recently to exhibit unexpected complexity under pressure. It was predicted from theory--and later confirmed by experiment--that lithium and sodium undergo a sequence of symmetry-breaking transitions, driven by a Peierls mechanism, at high pressures. Measurements of the sodium melting curve have subsequently revealed an unprecedented (and still unexplained) pressure-induced drop in melting temperature from 1,000 K at 30 GPa down to room temperature at 120 GPa. Here we report results from ab initio calculations that explain the unusual melting behaviour in dense sodium. We show that molten sodium undergoes a series of pressure-induced structural and electronic transitions, analogous to those observed in solid sodium but commencing at much lower pressure in the presence of liquid disorder. As pressure is increased, liquid sodium initially evolves by assuming a more compact local structure. However, a transition to a lower-coordinated liquid takes place at a pressure of around 65 GPa, accompanied by a threefold drop in electrical conductivity. This transition is driven by the opening of a pseudogap, at the Fermi level, in the electronic density of states--an effect that has not hitherto been observed in a liquid metal. The lower-coordinated liquid emerges at high temperatures and above the stability region of a close-packed free-electron-like metal. We predict that similar exotic behaviour is possible in other materials as well."
https://openalex.org/W2015493647,"Lateral compartmentalization of membrane proteins into microdomains regulates signal transduction; however, structural determinants are incompletely understood. Membrane glycoproteins bind galectins in proportion to the number (<i>i.e.</i> N<i>X</i>(S/T) sites) and degree of GlcNAc branching within attached <i>N</i>-glycans, forming a molecular lattice that negatively regulates T cell function and autoimmunity. We find that in resting T cells, partition of CD45 inside and T cell receptor (TCR)/CD4-Lck/Zap-70 outside microdomains is positively and negatively regulated by the galectin lattice and actin cytoskeleton, respectively. In the absence of TCR ligands, the galectin lattice counteracts F-actin to retain CD45 in microdomains while concurrently blocking TCR/CD4-Lck/Zap-70 partition to microdomains by preventing a conformational change in the TCR that recruits Nck/Wiscott Aldrich Syndrome (WASp)/SLP76/F-actin/CD4 to TCR. The counterbalancing activities of the galectin lattice and actin cytoskeleton negatively and positively regulate Lck activity in resting cells and CD45 <i>versus</i> TCR clustering and signaling at the early immune synapse, respectively. Microdomain-localized CD45 inactivates Lck and inhibits TCR signaling at the early immune synapse. Thus, the galectin lattice and actin cytoskeleton interact on opposing sides of the plasma membrane to control microdomain structure and function, coupling basal growth signaling with thresholds to activation."
https://openalex.org/W2124839883,"Like other viruses, productive hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection depends on certain critical host factors. We have recently shown that an interaction between HCV nonstructural protein NS5A and a host protein, TBC1D20, is necessary for efficient HCV replication. TBC1D20 contains a TBC (Tre-2, Bub2, and Cdc16) domain present in most known Rab GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). The latter are master regulators of vesicular membrane transport, as they control the activity of membrane-associated Rab proteins. To better understand the role of the NS5A-TBC1D20 interaction in the HCV life cycle, we used a biochemical screen to identify the TBC1D20 Rab substrate. TBC1D20 was found to be the first known GAP for Rab1, which is implicated in the regulation of anterograde traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex. Mutation of amino acids implicated in Rab GTPase activation by other TBC domain-containing GAPs abrogated the ability of TBC1D20 to activate Rab1 GTPase. Overexpression of TBC1D20 blocked the transport of exogenous vesicular stomatitis virus G protein from the endoplasmic reticulum, validating the involvement of TBC1D20 in this pathway. Rab1 depletion significantly decreased HCV RNA levels, suggesting a role for Rab1 in HCV replication.

Current interferon-based therapy is inadequate for most patients (1Williams R. Hepatology. 2006; 44: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). HCV is a positive, single-stranded RNA virus containing a 9.6-kb genome encoding a single ∼3000-amino acid polyprotein. This polyprotein is proteolytically processed into structural proteins that compose the mature virus and nonstructural proteins that are involved in replicating the viral genome (2Moradpour D. Penin F. Rice C.M. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Like other positive strand RNA viruses, HCV is also believed to replicate its RNA in association with intracellular membranes, although the details of replication complex assembly are unknown (3Moradpour D. Gosert R. Egger D. Penin F. Blum H.E. Bienz K. Antiviral Res. 2003; 60: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). hepatitis C virus GTPase-activating protein small interfering RNA endoplasmic reticulum green fluorescent protein vesicular stomatitis virus G protein HCV NS5A is a phosphoprotein of ∼56-58 kDa, depending on its phosphorylation status (4Tanji Y.

Cheong K.H. Lee C. Frank C.W. Glenn J.S. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 6682-6689Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Disruption of the amphipathic nature of the helix abolishes NS5A membrane localization and viral replication (9Elazar M. Cheong K.H. Liu P. Greenberg H.B. Rice C.M. Glenn J.S. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 6055-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The NS5A amphipathic α-helix is composed of a hydrophobic face proposed to be embedded in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and a polar charged face that is exposed to the cytosol and thought to mediate specific protein-protein interactions that are essential for the formation of a functional HCV replication complex (11Penin F. Brass V. Appel N. Ramboarina S. Montserret R. Ficheux D. Blum H.E. Bartenschlager R. Moradpour D. J. Biol.

That NS5A might be involved in this process is suggested by the reported interaction of NS5A with several proteins that are implicated in intracellular protein trafficking (12Shi S.T. Polyak S.J.

Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of some of these NS5A-interacting partners, such as the SNARE (soluble NSF attachment protein receptors)-like protein human vesicle-associated protein subtype A, was shown to inhibit HCV replication (15Xue Q. Ding H. Liu M. Zhao P. Gao J. Ren H. Liu Y. Qi Z.T. Arch. Virol. 2007; 152: 955-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Another family of proteins known to play critical roles in regulating vesicular membrane trafficking pathways are Rab proteins. Rab GTPases behave as membrane-associated molecular switches (16Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2710) Google Scholar): they interconvert between an active, GTP-bound form and an inactive, GDP-bound form. Rab GTPases have a very low intrinsic GTPase activity, and they depend on GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) to activate GTP hydrolysis. Human cells contain as many as 70 Rabs and at least 51 putative Rab GAPs (17Pfeffer S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 856-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Only a few of these GAPs have been matched to a specific Rab substrate. Rab proteins have been previously implicated in the life cycles of various viruses, including HCV (for example, see Refs. 18Stone M. Jia S. Do Heo W. Meyer T. Konan K.V. J.

These Rabs mediate the endocytosis, trafficking, or sorting of a variety of viral proteins. We have recently discovered the first example of a Rab GAP being exploited by a virus (21Sklan E.H.

Starting from a yeast two-hybrid screen, HCV NS5A was shown to specifically interact with the host cell protein TBC1D20 (21Sklan E.H. Staschke K. Oakes T.M. Elazar M. Winters M. Aroeti B. Danieli T. Glenn J.S. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 11096-11105Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The latter contains a TBC domain present in most known Rab GAPs (22Bernards A. Settleman J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Depletion of TBC1D20 severely impairs HCV replication and prevents new infection, with minimal effects on cell viability (21Sklan E.H. Staschke K. Oakes T.M. Elazar M. Winters M. Aroeti B. Danieli T.

These exciting results raised several key questions regarding the physiological role of TBC1D20 in host cells and in viral replication. We present here experiments that identify TBC1D20 as the Rab GAP for Rab1 and suggest an attractive mechanism used by HCV to subvert host cell machinery for the promotion of viral replication.

To express TBC1D20 amino acids 1-362, the TBC1D20 fragment was amplified by PCR and cloned into pET14b inframe with the N-terminal His tag. Immunofluorescence—BSC-1 or HeLa cells were grown on coverslips. The cells were fixed 18 h post-transfection using 4% formaldehyde.

Overnight cultures of Escherichia coli were diluted 1:100 in 500 ml of fresh medium and grown at 37 °C to an absorbance of 1. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Invitrogen) was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 3 h of growth, cells were pelleted and resuspended in 25 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8), 400 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Fos-Choline-13 (Anatrace Inc.), and Complete mini protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science)). After 15 min of incubation on ice, cells were lysed by two cycles in a French press at a pressure of 10,000 p.s.i. for 1 min, followed by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then passed through a 0.45-μm filter and loaded on a 1-ml HisTrap nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (GE Healthcare) in the presence of 20 mm imidazole (Sigma). Following two washes with lysis buffer, TBC1D20 was eluted in 2 ml of elution buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8), 400 mm NaCl, 0.1% Fos-Choline-13, and 400 mm imidazole). The pooled eluates were loaded onto a Superdex 200 column (HiLoad Superdex 200 prep grade, 26/60; GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with Superdex 200 buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2). Fractions containing TBC1D20 monomer were pooled and stored at -80 °C. Expression and purification were monitored by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie staining or Western blot analysis with an anti-His6 antibody (1:5000, Pharmingen). There were no differences in yield or purity between the mutant proteins and wild-type TBC1D20. GAP Assays—GAP assays were previously described (25Pan X. Eathiraj S. Munson M. Lambright D.G. Nature. 2006; 442: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Briefly, Rab GTPases were loaded with GTP by incubating 2-3 mg of protein with a 25-fold molar excess of GTP at 25 °C for 1 h in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Free nucleotide was then removed using D-Salt columns (Pierce) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl. The kinetics of intrinsic and GAP-accelerated GTP hydrolysis were measured by a continuous enzyme-coupled optical assay for the release of inorganic phosphate, with the use of reagents from the EnzChek phosphate assay kit (Invitrogen). GTP-loaded Rab GTPases were mixed with solutions containing the assay reagents and GAPs and dispensed into 96-well half-area microplates (Corning) using a Precision 2000 pipetting system (Bio-Tek). The final solutions contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.15 mm 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside, 0.75 unit/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm GTP-loaded Rab GTPases, and various concentrations of GAPs. Absorbance at 360 nm was monitored with a Safire microplate spectrometer (Tecan). Data were analyzed by fitting them simultaneously to the pseudo-first-order Michaelis-Menten model function (see Ref. 25Pan X. Eathiraj S. Munson M. Lambright D.G. Nature. 2006; 442: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) and intrinsic rate constant for GTP hydrolysis (kintr) were treated as global parameters. Carbonate Extraction of Membranes—A confluent 10-cm2 dish of Huh7 cells was transfected with GFP-TBC1D20. The cells were trypsinzed 24 h post-transfection, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with protease inhibitors, and homogenized with 50 passes through a 25-gauge needle. Breakage of the cells was confirmed using trypan blue exclusion. The supernatants were cleared at 500 × g and split into two equal volumes. Membranes were then pelleted by a 30-min centrifugation at 100,000 × g in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. The supernatant was saved as the cytosolic fraction, and the membranes were resuspended in 10 volumes of 0.3 m sucrose in 10 mm Tris (pH 7). An additional 10 volumes containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7) or 0.2 m sodium carbonate (pH 11) (27Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar) were added to the control and treated tube, respectively, followed by a 30-min incubation on ice. The homogenates were then spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Membranes were resuspended directly in sample buffer, and the supernatants were precipitated using methanol/chloroform precipitation and resuspended in sample buffer. Equivalent volumes of each sample were loaded on the gel and analyzed by immunoblot with anti-GFP antibodies (1:1000, Molecular Probes). VSV-G Trafficking Assays—HeLa cells were grown on coverslips and cotransfected with the VSV-G-yellow fluorescent protein (ts 045) expression plasmid and pCMV-Myc-TBC1D20 or the R105A mutant. The transfected cells were transferred to 40 °C 2 h post-transfection, and they were incubated for 16 h. The cells were then incubated at 32 °C for the appropriate chase period, followed by formaldehyde fixation and immunostaining. siRNAs—All siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon as duplexes. siCONTROL non-targeting siRNA #1 (Dharmacon) was used as a negative control. Rab1B siRNAs were as follows: Duplex 9, 5′-UGCAGGAGAUUGACCGCUAUU-3′ (sense) and 5′-UAGCGGUCAAUCUCCUGCAUU-3′ (antisense); Duplex 10, 5′-CCAGCGCGAACGUCAAUAAUU-3′ (sense) and 5′-UUAUUGACGUUCUCGCUGGUU-3′ (antisense); Duplex 11, 5′-CGGUGGGAUCUGAGUAUAUUU-3′ (sense) and 5′-AUAUACUCAGAUCCCACCGUU-3′ (antisense); and Duplex 12, 5′-GAAUAUGACUACCUGUUUAUU-3′ (sense) and 5′-UAAACAGGUAGUCAUAUUCUU-3′ (antisense). siRNA transfections were done using 100 nm siRNA/well in a 6-well plate. Real-time PCR—For real-time PCR experiments, Huh7.5 cells were transfected with siCONTROL or Rab1B siRNAs. The cells were trypsinized 8 h after transfection, and 1 × 105 cells were plated in a 12-well plate. The cells were allowed to adhere overnight and were infected with cell culture-grown HCV titered at 1.4 × 104 TCID50/ml, as described (28Lindenbach B.D. Evans M.J. Syder A.J. Wolk B. Tellinghuisen T.L. Liu C.C. Maruyama T. Hynes R.O. Burton D.R. McKeating J.A. Rice C.M. Science. 2005; 309: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar, 29Reed L.J. Muench H. Am. J. Hyg. 1938; 27: 493-497Google Scholar). 2 h after infection, cells were washed twice with the medium. After 72 h, RNA was extracted in triplicates using 0.5 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and then subjected to reverse transcription using random hexamers and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed on the resulting cDNA to quantify the amount of Rab1B, HCV, and actin RNAs (in separate reactions) in each sample, as compared with an in vitro transcribed HCV RNA standard and human actin standard (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), respectively. HCV was quantified using primers AGAGCCATAGTGGTCT and CCAAATCTCCAGGCATTGAGC and probe 6-carboxyfluorescein-CACCGGAATTGCCAGGACGACCGG-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine. Actin was quantified using β-actin control reagents (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rab1B was quantified using the TaqMan® gene expression assays probe and primer set for Rab1B (Assay ID Hs00823717_g1). TBC1D20 Is a Rab1 GAP—Human cells are predicted to have as many as 70 Rabs. To narrow down the number of potential substrates for the TBC1D20 GAP, we characterized the subcellular distribution of TBC1D20. When BSC-1 cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing TBC1D20 with an N-terminal GFP tag, a reticular pattern typical of ER localization was observed (Fig. 1). Confocal microscopy showed that in all the TBC1D20-expressing cells most of the TBC1D20 signal co-localized with the ER marker calnexin, confirming its ER localization. Based on this apparent ER localization, we predicted that the Rabs regulated by TBC1D20 are likely to be those associated with the ER. Because an apparent interaction between HCV NS4B and Rab5 was recently reported (18Stone M. Jia S. Do Heo W. Meyer T. Konan K.V. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 4551-4563Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and because some Rabs are known to be activated by more than one GAP (30Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 31Du L.-L. Collins R.N. Novick P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3253-3256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we performed a broader screen including 27 mammalian Rabs. The GAP Gyp1 (whose Rab substrates are known) was tested against Rab1, -2, -3, and -33 as a control for the specificity and activity of the Rabs tested (25Pan X. Eathiraj S. Munson M. Lambright D.G. Nature. 2006; 442: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Among the Rabs tested, TBC1D20 had a high selectivity for activating the Rab1 GTPase (Fig. 2). The activity of TBC1D20 was further investigated by simultaneous fitting of the data to a pseudo-first-order Michaelis-Menten model function. Activation of Rab1 GTP hydrolysis by TBC1D20 has an apparent catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of 360 m-1 s-1 (Fig. 3A). A recent crystallographic study revealed that Rab GAPs activate their Rab GTPase substrates via a so-called “dual finger” mechanism involving two critical catalytic residues supplied in trans by the TBC domain (25Pan X. Eathiraj S. Munson M. Lambright D.G. Nature. 2006; 442: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We therefore introduced two point mutations into the TBC domain of TBC1D20 to disrupt one of the above “fingers” and determined the ability of the resulting mutant TBC1D20 (R66A,R105A) to activate Rab1 GTPase activity. As shown in Fig. 3B, the GTPase-activating activity of TBC1D20 on Rab1 was abolished when these conserved arginine residues were mutated to alanine.FIGURE 2TBC1D20 is a Rab1 GAP. Purified TBC1D20 was reacted with 27 mammalian Rab GTPases. Catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) relative to the intrinsic rate constant for GTP hydrolysis was determined. Values represent the mean from duplicate wells. Note that only Rab1 displays significant activation by TBC1D20.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3GTP hydrolysis by Rab1 is enhanced by TBC1D20.

Boon-Chieng S. Mitaku S. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 1998; 14: 378-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar) revealed a C-terminal hydrophobic domain of 26 residues (Fig. 4, A and B). We hypothesized that the latter represents a transmembrane domain within TBC1D20. Experimental support for this hypothesis came during its purification. The amount of protein purified was extremely low without the presence of a detergent. Alkaline stripping was used to further confirm that TBC1D20 associates with membranes in a manner characteristic of integral membrane proteins. For this, Huh7 cells expressing GFP-TBC1D20 were homogenized, and lysates were separated into cytosolic and membrane fractions by centrifugation. Membranes were then washed with either sodium carbonate or buffer and incubated on ice for 30 min. Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunobloting. The GFP-tagged TBC1D20 was found exclusively in the membrane fraction and was resistant to alkaline extraction (Fig. 4C), consistent with the notion that TBC1D20 is an integral membrane protein. The presence of a transmembrane domain might cause aggregation of the purified TBC1D20 in vitro, affecting the efficiency of its GAP activity. Indeed, a TBC1D20 truncated form (amino acids 1-362) lacking the transmembrane domain was ∼10-fold more efficient (kcat/Km = 2700 m-1 s-1) than the full-length protein (Fig. 4D). Overexpression of TBC1D20 Induces Golgi Disruption—Rab1 is essential for the biogenesis of the Golgi complex (33Wilson B.S. Nuoffer C. Meinkoth J.L. McCaffery M. Feramisco J.R. Balch W.E. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 557-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Dominant negative forms of Rab1 and Rab1 depletion were shown to alter the structural integrity of the Golgi (33Wilson B.S. Nuoffer C. Meinkoth J.L. McCaffery M. Feramisco J.R. Balch W.E.

Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of the wild-type Rab1 or its constitutively active form did not. If TBC1D20 is indeed a Rab1 GAP in vivo, manipulation of TBC1D20 levels might influence Golgi morphology. To test this possibility, HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing TBC1D20 and its catalytically inactive mutant TBC1D20 R105A, both fused to GFP. In 90% of cells overexpressing the catalytically active form of TBC1D20, the Golgi complex was disrupted, as determined by the redistribution of GM130 to scattered punctate cytoplasmic structures (Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained with other Golgi markers, including p115 (36Allan B.B. Moyer B.D. Balch W.E. Science. 2000; 289: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) (data not shown) and β-coatomer (37Alvarez C. Garcia-Mata R. Brandon E. Sztul E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2116-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). No apparent changes in Golgi morphology were detected when the catalytically inactive mutant TBC1D20 R105A was overexpressed (Fig. 5) or upon TBC1D20 depletion (data not shown). While the manuscript was under review, a similar effect of overexpression of TBC1D20 on Golgi integrity was reported (38Haas A.K. Yoshimura S.-I. Stephens D.J. Preisinger C. Fuchs E. Barr F.A. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2997-3010Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).

Disc diffusion assays using Escherichia coli overexpressing GSTO-1 provided a test of resistance to long-term exposure under oxidative stress. After affinity purification, the recombinant GSTO-1 had minimal catalytic activity toward classic GST substrates but displayed significant thiol oxidoreductase and dehydroascorbate reductase activity. Microinjection of the GSTO-1-promoter green fluorescent protein construct and immunolocalization by electron microscopy localized the protein exclusively in the intestine of all postembryonic stages of C. elegans. Deletion analysis identified an approximately 300-nucleotide sequence upstream of the ATG start site necessary for GSTO-1 expression. Site-specific mutagenesis of a GATA transcription factor binding motif in the minimal promoter led to the loss of reporter expression. Similarly, RNA interference (RNAi) of Elt-2 indicated the involvement of this gut-specific transcription factor in GSTO-1 expression. Transcriptional up-regulation under stress conditions of GSTO-1 was confirmed by analyzing promoter-reporter constructs in transgenic C. elegans strains. To investigate the function of GSTO-1 in vivo, transgenic animals overexpressing GSTO-1 were generated exhibiting an increased resistance to juglone-, paraquat-, and cumene hydroperoxide-induced oxidative stress. Specific silencing of the GSTO-1 by RNAi created worms with an increased sensitivity to several prooxidants, arsenite, and heat shock. We conclude that the stress-responsive GSTO-1 plays a key role in counteracting environmental stress."

Heme reverses the repression by binding to Bach1 to prevent DNA binding, which facilitates binding of Nrf2, the transcriptional activator (23Sun J. Brand M. Zenke Y. Tashiro S. Groudine M. Igarashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Heme also inactivates Bach1 by inducing nuclear export (24Suzuki H. Tashiro S. Hira S.

Manipulating Bach1 expression changed expression of MARE/ARE genes: (i) Mouse Bach1 knock-outs displayed significant increases in ho1 RNA in several tissues, which were diminished by concomitant knock out of Nrf2 (4Sun J.

To determine if Bach1 is the heme target in MARE/ARE-dependent regulation of ferritin and thioredoxin reductase1 (trr), in analogy to ho1, β-globin, and qr promoters, we compared effects of Bach1 siRNA and Bach1 overexpression in HepG2 cells on heme-regulated fth, ftl, and trr expression and demonstrated that Bach1 was the heme-reversible repressor. In addition, using soluble, recombinant Bach1 and MARE/ARE-DNA duplexes (40 base pairs) in vitro, we showed heme-reversible binding of Bach1 to the ftl MARE/ARE sequence. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Bach1 binding to ftl, fth, trr, ho1, qr, and β-globin MARE/ARE sequences falls into three stability groups that may relate to differential regulation in vivo. The ftl promoter and MARE/ARE mutation constructs, cell culture experiments, and luminescence assay have been described previously (1Hintze K.J. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15048-15052Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). trr and qr promoter constructs known to contain a functional ARE (27Hintze K.J. Wald K.A. Zeng H. Jeffery E.H. Finley J.W. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 2721-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) were used as positive controls. Hepa1c1c7, a mouse hepatoma cell line, was used for chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments and was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4500 mg/liter glucose; Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 unit/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma line, were used for overexpression and siRNA studies and were seeded in collagen-coated, 12-well plates (160,000 cells/well) using minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) and 100 unit/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and cultured in 95% ambient air, 5% CO2 as previously described (1Hintze K.J. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15048-15052Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The concentration of heme (80 μm) was selected for maximum induction of ftl expression in HepG2 cells (1Hintze K.J. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15048-15052Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar); preliminary data on ftl induction showed similar effects with either hemin or rabbit hemoglobin. Microscopic observation of the HepG2 cells showed no evidence of toxicity under any of the conditions used. Total RNA was isolated (RNeasy; Qiagen) 24 h later. RNA concentrations of all genes were determined by reverse transcription PCR using TaqMan Gene Expression Assay kits (Applied Bioscience) and an ABI 7900 Sequence Detection System (Applied Bioscience). Differences in RNA concentrations were quantified by the cycles to fluorescence midpoint cycle threshold calculation (2−[ ΔCt experimental gene −ΔCt housekeeping gene]), using β-actin as the housekeeping gene. The procedures were used as we have previously described them (28Sawado T. Igarashi K. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10226-10231Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Chromatin Fixation and Purification—In brief, Hepa1c1c7 cells were fixed by adding formaldehyde to 1% final concentration for 5 min at 25 °C. Cells were then sonicated to prepare chromatin suspensions of 300-1000-bp DNA in length. Immunoprecipitations were carried out as previously described (28Sawado T. Igarashi K. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10226-10231Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Antibodies used were anti-Bach1 (A1-6) (23Sun J. Brand M. Zenke Y. Tashiro S. Groudine M. Igarashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and normal rabbit serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Normal rabbit serum was used as a negative control. PCR reactions were carried out by using EX Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo). The primers were as follows: FTH (a gift from Dr. Atsushi Maruyama, Hirosaki University, Japan), 5′-CCTACCCCCTCCATGACAAAG-3′ and 5′-AGGCAGGCCCCTCTGTTCT-3′; and ftl, 5′-GCCCTTAGTGGAAGGGGTAG-3′ and 5′-TAGGCTAGCCACTCCAGAGC-3′. Primers and chromatin immunoprecipitation conditions for mouse β-globin (HS-2), ho1 (E1), and Mcm5 were the same as before (29Sun J. Muto A. Hoshino H. Kobayashi A. Nishimura S. Yamamoto M.

Immunoprecipitation with Bach1 Antiserum—48 h after transfection with Bach1 siRNA, as described above, nuclear proteins were extracted from the cells using the NE-PER nuclear extraction kit (Pierce) and Halt Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Pierce). Equal amounts of nuclear protein (80 μg) from each treatment were run on a Tris-HCl, 12% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) using Towbin's buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.5% SDS, 20% v/v methanol) containing 20% methanol and a Mini Trans-Blot cell (Bio-Rad) run at 350 mA for 1 h. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a solution of T-TBS containing 1% nonfat milk and 1,000-fold dilution of anti-Bach1 antiserum A1-6 raised in rabbit (24Suzuki H. Tashiro S. Hira S. Sun J. Yamazaki C. Zenke Y. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2544-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Blots were washed in T-TBS (Tween 20-Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6, 0.1% Tween 20, 20 mm Tris·Cl, 137 mm NaCl) and then incubated for 1 h with a 30,000-fold dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated, anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Sigma), followed by washing in T-TBS. Blots were developed with incubation with 0.56 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3indoyl phosphate (Sigma) and 0.48 mm nitroblue tetrazolium (Sigma) in 10 mm Tris/HCl and quantified by densitometry. The Bach1 overexpression plasmid was obtained from Origene (catalogue number SC107917); cells were transfected with 1 μg of the plasmid DNA 24 h after seeding, using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Control cells were transfected with empty vector pCMV6XL-6. RNA was extracted and analyzed as described above. Targeting Bach1 RNA—A complex of four unique siRNA duplexes (obtained from a commercial vendor) (Dharmacon) that were developed and described by Shan et al. (26Shan Y. Lambrecht R.W. Ghaziani T. Donohue S.E. Bonkovsky H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51769-51774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was used to decrease Bach1 RNA. A titration showed that 50 nm siRNA decreased Bach1 RNA more than either 25 or 100 nm siRNA. The cells were transfected using Dharmafect 2 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Dharmacon) 24 h after seeding. Control cells were transfected with 50 nm siControl Non-targeting Duplex 1 (Dharmacon), consisting of four siRNA duplexes designed to avoid inhibiting any known eukaryotic genes. Bach1 siRNA-treated cells and controls were treated with Me2SO (0.2%) or Me2SO (0.2%) with hemin (80 μm) 24 h after transfection. The final concentration of Me2SO was 0.2% for all treatments. RNA Analysis—Total RNA was analyzed by reverse transcription PCR as described above. Luciferase Reporter Experiments—4 h after siRNA transfection, the cells were co-transfected with pRLSV40 Renilla luciferase, a control for transfection, and the experimental luciferase constructs (test promoter + firefly luciferase). siRNA-treated cells and controls were treated with Me2SO (0.2%) or Me2SO (0.2%) + hemin (80 μm) 24 h after transfection, harvested 24 h later, and assayed for luciferase using the Dual Luciferase Assay kit (Promega). Data from three independent experiments are expressed as the ratio of firefly luciferase (test promoter)/Renilla luciferase (transfection control). RNA Concentration—Real-time PCR was carried out as described above with samples from three independent experiments. Data are averaged from three independent experiments, and the errors are expressed as the standard deviation. Bach1 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells grown in Luria Bertani medium containing 1 m sorbitol and 250 μm betaine to enhance production of native, folded Bach1 protein and to increase the yield of soluble protein (31Blackwell J.R. Horgan R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 295: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The cells were transformed with human, His-tagged Bach1 clone previously described (22Igarashi K. Hoshino H. Muto A. Suwabe N. Nishikawa S. Nakauchi H. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11783-11790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Induction of Bach1 expression after adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) was for 12 h at room temperature. Washed cells were sonicated and fractionated by centrifugation for 10 min, 3,000 × g, 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was further clarified by centrifugation for 2 h at 20,000 × g at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C in Ni-NTA resin (Novagen), followed by elution with Novagen Ni-NTA buffer. Column eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on pre-cast 12% gels (Invitrogen) and stained with Coomassie Blue. Pooled fractions of the protein isolated from E. coli were analyzed by both Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting. Horseradish peroxidase conjugated to an anti-His tag mouse monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) was used in the immunoblot with ECL+ chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences), and Coomassie Blue was used to stain the protein and markers (Fig. 1). Protein yields of the soluble, recombinant Bach1 protein from E. coli were ∼15 mg/ml. Recombinant, soluble Bach1 from E. coli was used with double-stranded DNA (40 bp) labeled with 32P on one strand. Bach1/DNA binding used the method described by Carey for protein-DNA interactions (32Carey J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Binding occurred by mixing soluble, recombinant Bach1 protein and [32P]DNA duplex (1.6 pmol) at protein:DNA stoichiometries of 0-72:1 in buffer (20 μl of 60 mm KCl, 24 mm Hepes·Na, 4 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, and 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.2) that was incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. One strand of the DNA (Integrated DNA Technologies) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), purified with MicroSpin G-50 columns (Amersham Biosciences), followed by annealing to the complementary strand to make 32P-labeled, double-stranded probes. Mouse β-globin containing the tandem MARE of HS2 (22Igarashi K. Hoshino H. Muto A. Suwabe N. Nishikawa S. Nakauchi H. Yamamoto M. J. Biol.

Gene sequences and accession numbers are shown in Table 1. DNA and DNA·protein complexes were resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, dried, and analyzed using phosphoimagery. To quantify the results, the intensities of bound or unbound [32P]DNA were determined using Image-Quant software. The percent shift was calculated as follows: ([32P]DNA:protein intensity/[32P]DNA intensity + [32P]DNA: protein intensity) × 100. To compare Bach1-DNA interactions among the different MARE/ARE sequences, the % bound DNA (1.6 pm) was plotted versus the protein:DNA ratio over the range zero, 9:1, 18:1, 36:1, and 72:1. The apparent Kd (protein concentration required for 50% DNA binding) for each DNA duplex was calculated as previously described (36Fletcher J.E. Copeland P.R. Driscoll D.M. Krol A. RNA. 2001; 7: 1442-1453PubMed Google Scholar).

We have shown that TNIIIA2, a synthetic 22-mer peptide derived from TN-C, stimulated β1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion of nonadherent and adherent cell types, by inducing activation of β1 integrin. The active site of TNIIIA2 appeared cryptic in the TN-C molecule but was exposed by MMP-2 processing of TN-C. The following results suggest that cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan (HSPG), including syndecan-4, participated in TNIIIA2-induced β1 integrin activation: 1) TNIIIA2 bound to cell surface HSPG via its HS chains, as examined by photoaffinity labeling; 2) heparitinase I treatment of cells abrogated β1 integrin activation induced by TNIIIA2; 3) syndecan-4 was isolated by affinity chromatography using TNIIIA2-immobilized beads; 4) small interfering RNA-based down-regulation of syndecan-4 expression reduced TNIIIA2-induced β1 integrin activation, and consequent cell adhesion to fibronectin; 5) overexpression of syndecan-4 core protein enhanced TNIIIA2-induced activation of β1 integrin. However, treatments that targeted the cytoplasmic region of syndecan-4, including ectopic expression of its mutant truncated with the cytoplasmic domains and treatment with protein kinase Cα inhibitor Gö6976, did not influence the TNIIIA2 activity. These results suggest that a TNIIIA2-related matricryptic site of the TN-C molecule, exposed by MMP-2 processing, may have bound to syndecan-4 via its HS chains and then induced conformational change in β1 integrin necessary for its functional activation. A lateral interaction of β1 integrin with the extracellular region of the syndecan-4 molecule may be involved in this conformation change.

Chem. 2005; 280: 26641-26644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). TN-C is expressed predominantly during embryogenesis, wound healing, and neoplastic processes, in which alternative mRNA splicing within the fibronectin (FN) type III-like (FN-III) repeats can generate different TN-C isoforms (4Lightner V.A. Slemp C.A. Erickson H.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 580: 260-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Multifunctional properties have been identified for TN-C, including effects on cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, survival, and differentiation. The effects of TN-C on cell adhesion are particularly complex; the TN-C substrate supports attachment of some cell types, but is nonadhesive or even repulsive for other cell types (5Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Kalla P. Pearson C.A. Beck K. Chiquet M. Cell. 1988; 53: 383-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 6Bourdon M.A. Ruoslahti E. J.

Based on these antipodal effects on cell adhesion, TN-C is multifunctional and is therefore classified as an adhesion modulatory ECM protein, a so-called “matricellular” protein (8Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Various TN-C molecule domains, especially FN-III repeats, including the alternative splicing domains, have been implicated in its function as a matricellular protein. However, their contributions to the adhesion modulatory effects of TN-C are not completely understood.Interactions of cells with the ECM are largely mediated by members of the integrin superfamily of adhesive receptors. The most unique feature of integrins is their ability to alter ligand binding and signaling activities. Because integrin-mediated cell-ECM interactions play key roles in maintaining normal cellular functions, affinity changes in integrins are critical for the anchorage-dependent cellular processes, such as growth, survival, migration, and differentiation. Integrin activation is considered to be regulated by “inside-out” signals from the cell interior, that is, those triggered by extracellular stimuli. However, the molecular pathways leading to inside-out activation of integrins are still poorly understood.There have been many studies indicating that ECM proteins such as FNs, laminins, and collagens have biologically active cryptic sites. These matricryptic sites are exposed through biological processes such as proteolytic cleavage and conformational change in response to multimerization of ECM proteins, binding to other molecules, or cell-mediated mechanical forces (9Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1345-1350PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sage E.H. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 182-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Davis et al. (11Davis G.E. Bayless K.J. Davis M.J. Meininger G.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1489-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) coined the term “matricryptins” to describe biologically active proteolytic fragments of ECM proteins. Matricryptic sites and matricryptins of ECM proteins have been implicated in a variety of events governed by cell-ECM interactions.We have previously found that FN has both cell adhesion sites and a matricryptic site opposing cell adhesion. The 22-mer matricryptin, FNIII14, derived from the 14th FN-III repeat, strongly suppresses β1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion to FN, whose activity depends on its C-terminal amino acid sequence, YTIYVIAL (12Fukai F. Hasebe S. Ueki M. Mutoh M. Ohgi C. Takahashi H. Takeda K. Katayama T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 189-192PubMed Google Scholar). This cryptic antiadhesive site is exposed by either FN degradation with MMP-2, or FN interaction with heparin (13Watanabe K. Takahashi H. Habu Y. Kamiya-Kubushiro N. Kamiya S. Nakamura H. Yajima H. Ishii T. Katayama T. Miyazaki K. Fukai F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7138-7144Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As a negative modulator of cell-ECM interaction, FNIII14 influences physiological cellular processes such as survival (14Fukai F. Mashimo M. Akiyama K. Goto T. Tanuma S. Katayama T. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and differentiation (15Kamiya S. Kato R. Wakabayashi M. Tohyama T. Eanami I. Ueki M. Yajima H. Ishii T. Nakamura H. Katayama T. Takagi J. Fukai F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3270-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), as well as pathological events such as tumor metastasis (16Kato R. Ishikawa T. Kamiya S. Oguma F. Ueki M. Goto S. Nakamura H. Katayama T. Fukai F. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 2455-2462PubMed Google Scholar).There are several sequences similar to the YTIYVIAL sequence of FN in other ECM proteins including TN-C. Two analogous sequences, YTITIRGV and YTIYLNGD, are present in the FN-III repeat A2 of the alternative splicing region and the C terminus fibrinogen-globe, respectively, of the human TN-C molecule (supplemental Fig. S1). These analogous sequences may be involved in TN-C cell adhesion modulatory activity. We have investigated the effects of synthetic TN-C peptides containing these analogous sequences on cell adhesion to FN. Surprisingly, TNIIIA2, a 22-mer TN-C peptide containing YTITIRGV, stimulated cell adhesion to FN by inducing conformational and functional activation of β1 integrin. The active site of TNIIIA2 appears cryptic but was exposed by MMP-2 processing. Some of our results suggest that cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans (HSPG), including syndecan-4, participated in β1 integrin activation in response to TNIIIA2, without requiring its cytoplasmic domains. Thus, a TNIIIA2-related matricryptic site of TN-C molecule, exposed by MMP-2 processing, may induce a lateral interaction of β1 integrin with the syndecan-4 ectodomain, resulting in conformational change in β1 integrin necessary for its functional activation. The cell adhesion-modulatory activity of TN-C, at least in part, may be due to the TNIIIA2-related matricryptic site/matricryptin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture, Transfection, and Treatment with Enzymes or Methyl-β-cyclodextrin—SV40-transformed human embryonic lung fibroblasts WI38VA13 and normal mouse fibroblasts NIH3T3 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 10% CS, respectively. Human erythroleukemia cells K562 and human Burkitt's lymphoma cells Ramos were cultured in RPMI1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (Clontecs, Sanko Junyaku Co.) were grown and treated as described earlier (16Kato R. Ishikawa T. Kamiya S. Oguma F. Ueki M. Goto S. Nakamura H. Katayama T. Fukai F. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 2455-2462PubMed Google Scholar). WI38VA13 cells were treated with 0.1 unit/ml of heparitinase I and 0.5 unit/ml of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku Kogyo) at 37 °C for 30 min. Plasmid DNAs for syndecan-4 (S4, S4ΔR) were kindly provided by Dr. John R. Couchman (Imperial College London). At 24 h following transfection using Transfast (Promega), NIH3T3 cells were diluted and grown in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Calbiochem) to select clones stably expressing syndecan-4. Overexpression of syndecan-4 by the clones was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using anti syndecan-4 mAb (N-19).Peptides—The GRGDSP was purchased from IWAKI. Peptides derived from human FN (FNIII14: TEATITGLEPGTEYTIYVIAL), TN-C (TNIIIA2), their mutants (supplemental Fig. S1 and supplemental Table S1), and CS-1 (LHPGEILDVPST) were synthesized using the solid phase strategy combined with the Boc and Fmoc chemistry, in which a Cys was added to the C terminus of each peptide to increase their activity by dimerization and to facilitate coupling to SG-beads. For a photoaffinity cross-linking of a putative cell surface receptor of TNIIIA2, a photosensitive derivative of TNIIIA2, RSTDLPGLKAAT-p-benzoyl-phenylalanine (Bpa)-YTITIRGVK (biotin) C (biotinylated TNIIIA2-Bpa), which has been shown to retain the TNIIIA2 activity (17Hayashi R. Miura S. Saito Y. Fukai F. Kodama H. Peptide Science. 2004; 2003: 289-292Google Scholar), was synthesized using standard solid state methodology (18Dorman G. Prestwich G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5661-5673Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). These synthetic peptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC and characterized by mass spectrometry.Antibodies—Function-blocking mAbs against integrin subunits α4 (P1H4), α5 (P1D6), and β2 (WT.3) were purchased from CHEMICON, while that against human integrin subunit β1 (DE9) was from UPSTATE and that against mouse integrin subunit β1 (Ha2/5) was from BD Biosciences. mAbs recognizing the active conformation of integrin subunit β1, i.e. AG89 (MBL), HUTS-4 (CHEMICON), and 9EG7 (BD Biosciences), were purchased as noted. Antibodies reactive with the heparan sulfate (HS) chain (10E4) and an anti-ΔHS mAb (3G10) recognizing a neoepitope generated by heparitinase digestion of HSPG were purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo. Anti-syndecan-4 (N-19, 5G9), anti-syndecan-1(C-20), and anti-β1 integrin (M106) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-VCAM-1 mAb was from BD Biosciences.Confocal Microscopy—Cells were seeded on FN-coated cover glasses, incubated with or without TNIIIA2 for 1 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.03% Triton X-100. For immunostaining of β1 integrins, the cells were not permeabilized. The cells were stained with anti-vinculin Ab (Simga) and rhodamine-phalloidin (Invitrogen), or an anti-integrin β1 mAb (AG89 and HUTS-4), and mounted on slides. Confocal microscope images were obtained with an inverted microscope (Fluoview FV1000, Olympus) fitted with a ×60 UPlanSApo oil-immersion objective (NA 1.35) and Fluoview software.Cell Adhesion Assay—Cell adhesion assay was performed as described previously (19Fukai F. Suzuki H. Suzuki K. Tsugita A. Katayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8807-8813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ramos cell adhesion to HUVEC was performed as reported previously (16Kato R. Ishikawa T. Kamiya S. Oguma F. Ueki M. Goto S. Nakamura H. Katayama T. Fukai F. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 2455-2462PubMed Google Scholar).Flow Cytometric Analysis of β1 Integrin Activation—Activation of β1 integrins on the cells was evaluated by flow cytometric analysis (FACS Calibur and FACS Aria: Becton Dickinson; Cytoron: Ortho Diagnostics) using three different mAbs, i.e. AG89, HUTS-4 and 9EG7, recognizing the active β1 integrin conformation-specific epitope, as described previously (13Watanabe K. Takahashi H. Habu Y. Kamiya-Kubushiro N. Kamiya S. Nakamura H. Yajima H. Ishii T. Katayama T. Miyazaki K. Fukai F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7138-7144Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Recombinant TN-C Protein and Its Processing with Proteinases—A recombinant protein containing the FN-III repeats A1–4 of human TN-C (rA1–4) was prepared as described previously (20Tsunoda T. Inada H. Kalembeyi I. Imanaka-Yoshida K. Sakakibara M. Okada R. Katsuta K. Sakakura T. Majima Y. Yoshida T. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 1857-1867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA encoding the region was generated by PCR using human fetal brain Marathon-Ready cDNA (BD Biosciences Clontech) as the template and primers consisting of 5′-AGTGGATCCACTGAACAAGCCCCTGAGC-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTGGGCAGTTCGTTCAGCACCAGAGA-3′. rA1–4 was processed in a dialysis bag (Sanko) at room temperature as follows. rA1-4 mixed with trypsin (1:200, w/w) was dialyzed first against PBS(-) for 6–24 h, next against PBS(-) containing 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate and then against the serum-free medium. rA1–4 protein mixed with MMP-2 (1:100, w/w) and 2 mm p-aminophenylmercuric acetate was dialyzed first against the buffer containing 2 mm CaCl2 for 6–24 h, next against the buffer containing MMP-2 inhibitor GM6001 (10 μm) and then against the serum-free medium. As a control, rA1–4 protein was treated under the same conditions without MMP-2.Photoaffinity Labeling—WI38VA13 cells (3 × 105) spread on a 6-well plate were incubated with biotinylated TNIIIA2-Bpa (5 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence or absence of heparin (20 μg/ml) and then irradiated with UV (two 15-watt lamps, 365 nm) for 30 min on ice at a distance of 10 cm. Cells were dissolved with 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Aliquots of the lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis using avidin-conjugated peroxidase. Another aliquot of the lysate was mixed with avidin-conjugated beads to precipitate the biotinylated TNIIIA2-Bpa-linked molecules. After washing the beads extensively with the lysis buffer, the bound materials were eluted with Laemmli's buffer and then subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-HS and anti-β1 (DE9) mAbs.Affinity Chromatography—WI38VA13 cells (1 × 109) dissolved with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4 containing 0.15 m NaCl, 4 m urea, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was incubated at 4 °C for 16 h with TNIIIA2-immobilized SG beads, which have been successfully used as an affinity resin showing minimal nonspecific interactions (21Shimizu N. Sugimoto K. Tang J. Nishi T. Sato I. Hiramoto M. Aizawa S. Hatakeyama M. Ohba R. Hatori H. Yoshikawa T. Suzuki F. Oomori A. Tanaka H. Kawaguchi H. Watanabe H. Honda H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). After washing the beads with the lysis buffer containing 4 m urea, the bound materials were eluted with 1 m NaCl. To digest GAG chains, the purified sample was dialyzed (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 20 mm sodium acetate, 0.1% CHAPS) and then treated with heparitinase I (0.1 milliunits/ml) and chondroitinase ABC (1 unit/ml) at room temperature for 18 h, and then subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-ΔHS (3G10), anti-syndecan-4 (D-16 and N-19), and anti-syndecan-1 (C-20) mAbs.Syndecan-4 Knockdown by RNAi—siRNAs of syndecan-4 (340CACCGAACCCAAGAAACTA358), (714GGGTGAGGTCAACCTAATA732) (GenBank™/EMBL/DDBJ accession no. D13292) and the negative control siRNA were obtained from RNAi, Japan. The siRNAs were transfected into cells by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and the cells were used for experiments at 72 h after transfection. RNAi-mediated knockdown of syndecan-4 expression was verified by flow cytometry and immunoblot analysis using anti-syndecan-4 mAb (5G9).RESULTSStimulation of Cell Adhesion to FN by a TN-C-derived Peptide—We first examined whether synthetic TN-C peptides containing analogous sequences, YTITIRGV and YTIYLNGD in their C terminus, termed TNIIIA2 and TNfbg, respectively (supplemental Fig. S1), exerted any effect on cell adhesion to FN. WI38VA13 cells were seeded onto FN-coated plates, with or without one of the synthetic peptides. In the absence of these peptides, the cells began attaching to the FN substrate about 30 min after seeding, while many cells had not spread, even after 60 min (Fig. 1A). Focal contact did not appear in these attached cells (Fig. 1B). In the presence of TNIIIA2, most cells had attached completely within 60 min, and many had already spread on the FN (Fig. 1A). There was a concomitant appearance of focal contact and actin stress fiber reorganization (Fig. 1B). A control peptide, TNIIIA2scr, in which the YTITIRGV sequence is shuffled (RITYITGV), and TNfbg were inactive (Figs. 1A and 2A). TNIIIA2-stimulated cell adhesion in a dose-dependent manner, and this was inhibited by function-blocking mAbs directed to integrin subunits α4, α5, and β1, but not β2 (Fig. 2, A and B).FIGURE 2Effects of TNIIIA2 on integrin-mediated cell adhesion. WI38VA13 (A and B), K562 (C and D), and Ramos (E–G) cells suspended in serum-free medium (1 × 104/ml) in the presence of TNIIIA2 or TNIIIA2scr (50 μg/ml) were seeded with or without Mn2+ (1 mm), anti-integrin mAb (20 μg/ml), or CS-1 peptide (200 μg/ml) into a 96-well plates coated with the FN (0.5 μg/ml in A and B;5 μg/ml in C–E). F and G, Ramos cells were seeded onto a HUVEC monolayer which was prepared on a 48-well plate and treated as indicated. HUVEC were pretreated with or without TNF-α (10 ng/ml) for 24 h (16Kato R. Ishikawa T. Kamiya S. Oguma F. Ueki M. Goto S. Nakamura H. Katayama T. Fukai F. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 2455-2462PubMed Google Scholar). In all experiments, cells were allowed to adhere for 1 h, and the number of cells either attached (white bars) or spread (gray bars) was counted as described previously (12Fukai F. Hasebe S. Ueki M. Mutoh M. Ohgi C. Takahashi H. Takeda K. Katayama T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 189-192PubMed Google Scholar). Each point represents the mean ± S.E. of triplicate determinations. One of three individual experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then examined the effect of TNIIIA2 on adhesion of nonadherent hematopoietic progenitor cell lines, K562 (which exclusively expresses α5β1 as a β1 class integrin) and Ramos (which only expresses α4β1 of the β1 integrins), whose integrins are known to be in their inactive states. K562 cells attached specifically to FN only in the presence of Mn2+, an integrin activator (Fig. 2C). TNIIIA2 was capable of inducing K562 cell attachment to FN without Mn2+, and this was blocked by mAbs anti-α5 and β1, but not α4 (Fig. 2D). TNIIIA2 also induced Ramos cell attachment to FN without Mn2+, and this was blocked by CS-1 and an anti-α4 mAb, but not by anti-α5 mAb (Fig. 2E). Ramos cells attached to HUVEC via α4β1-VCAM-1 interaction, for which Ramos cells and HUVEC had to be pretreated with Mn2+ and TNF-α, respectively (Fig. 2F). TNIIIA2 induced Ramos cell attachment onto HUVEC without Mn2+, in an α4β1-VCAM-1 interaction-specific manner (Fig. 2G). Thus, the effects of TNIIIA2 on nonadherent cell adhesion lead us to speculate that this peptide may induce activation of β1 integrin.TNIIIA2 Induces Activation of β1 Integrin—The status of β1 integrin activation can be evaluated by its accessibility to anti-β1 integrin mAbs, such as AG89 (22Takagi J. Isobe T. Takada Y. Saito Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 914-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and HUTS-4 (23Luque A. Gomez M. Puzon W. Takada Y. Sanchez-Madrid F. Cabanas C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11067-11075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), both of which recognize the active conformation-specific epitope of β1 subunit, regardless of the α subunit. We performed flow cytometric analysis with those mAbs to investigate whether TNIIIA2 was able to influence the conformational status of β1 integrin (Fig. 3, A and B).FIGURE 3TNIIIA2 induces conformational activation of β1 integrins. K562 (A) or WI38VA13 (B) cells suspended in serum-free medium (5 × 104/ml) were incubated with vehicle (panel a), Mn2+ (1 mm)(panel b), GRGDSP (500 μg/ml) (panel c), Mn2+ plus GRGDSP (panel d), TNIIIA2 at 15 μg/ml (panel e) or 30 μg/ml (panel f), or TNIIIA2 (30 μg/ml) plus GRGDSP (panel g) for 30 min with occasional shaking. Flow cytometric analyses were performed using the FITC-labeled anti-β1 integrin mAb, AG89, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data shown are representative of three individual experiments. C and D, confocal microscopic observation of active β1 integrins on K562 (C) or WI38VA13 (D) cell surfaces. Cells were plated on FN-coated cover glasses for 1 h in the absence (left panels, Control) or presence (right panels, +TNIIIA2) of TNIIIA2 (25 μg/ml), fixed, washed to remove unadhered cells and then incubated with FITC-AG89 (C) or FITC-HUTS-4 (D). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. Scale bars, 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Unstimulated K562 cells showed only low accessibility to AG89 (Fig. 3A, panel a), while Mn2+ stimulation slightly increased expression of the AG89 epitope (Fig. 3A, panel b). Addition of GRGDSP alone, a ligand of integrin α5β1, also caused a slight increase in expression of the AG89 epitope (Fig. 3A, panel c), and GRGDSP together with Mn2+ further increased the AG89 epitope expression (Fig. 3A, panel d). TNIIIA2 induced a remarkable increase in expression of the AG89 epitope in a dose-dependent manner even without Mn2+ (Fig. 3, A, panels e and f). Addition of GRGDSP together with TNIIIA2 caused a further but slight increase in expression of the AG89 epitope (Fig. 3A, panel g). TNIIIA2 treatment (at least within 3 h) did not change expression of the β1 integrin subunit under the experimental conditions used here, as confirmed by both flow cytometric and immunoblot analyses (data not shown). Expression of the active β1-specific epitope, in response to TNIIIA2, was similarly confirmed by using either another mAb (HUTS-4) (supplemental Fig. S2A) or another nonadherent cell line, Ramos (supplemental Fig. S2B). Conformational change in the β1 integrin was also investigated using an adherent cell type WI38VA13. The results, characterized by a dramatic conformational change in response to TNIIIA2, were almost the same as those observed with nonadherent cell types, confirmed by using AG89 (Fig. 3B) and HUTS-4 (data not shown). Thus, in both nonadherent and adherent cell types, expression of the AG89 and HUTS-4 epitopes in response to TNIIIA2 correlated well with the effects of this peptide on cell adhesion to FN or HUVEC, suggesting that TNIIIA2 stimulated β1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion by inducing β1 integrin activation.We next performed immunofluorescence microscopic analysis of β1 integrin, by using the HUTS-4 and AG89 mAbs. Without stimulation, only a low level of β1 integrins expressed the AG89 epitope on K562 cells (Fig. 3C). When the cells were stimulated with TNIIIA2, the dots of punctate staining appeared intensely on the basal surfaces, with a concomitant increase in the number of K562 cells attached to the FN (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, expression of the HUTS-4 epitope was detected peripherally on WI38VA13 cells spreading on the FN (Fig. 3D, left), but became much more remarkable after incubation with TNIIIA2 (Fig. 3D, right). The results show that TNIIIA2 induces a net increase in the quantity of activated β1 integrin on cell surfaces.Active Site of TNIIIA2 Is Cryptic in the TN-C Molecule—To characterize the active site of TNIIIA2 in the TN-C molecule, we first performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis to identify the amino acid residues in the sequence YTITIRGV, which was essential for the TMIIIA2 activity. Supplemental Table S1 presents the mutant peptides tested and summarizes the results of their abilities to induce β1 integrin activation, as evaluated by flow cytometric analysis using AG89 (data not shown). The TNIIIA2 activity was highly sensitive to single Ala replacement of the two Ile and Val residues at positions 16, 18, and 21, respectively, and the resultant peptides were inactive for β1 integrin activation. The replacement of Arg19 with Ala caused partial reduction in TNIIIA2 activity, while alternative replacement of Arg19 with Glu, resulted in complete loss of the activity, suggesting the necessity of a positive net charge, as well as specific amino acids (two Ile and Val) for β1 integrin activation in this peptide.To confirm whether the active site of TNIIIA2 is exposed on the TN-C molecule, we examined the effects of a recombinant protein composed of the FN-III repeats A1–4 (rA1–4) (supplemental Fig. S1) on K562 cell attachment to the FN substrate. K562 cell attachment to FN was not affected by rA1–4, while processing of rA1–4 with MMP-2, but not trypsin, caused a significant increase in K562 cell attachment to FN, even without Mn2+ (Fig. 4A). The MMP-2 digest of rA1–4 also weakly induced β1 integrin activation (Fig. 4B). Thus, the active site appears to be buried within the TN-C molecule, but exposed by processing with MMP-2.FIGURE 4Exposure of the matricryptic site by processing of rA1–4 protein with MMP-2. rA1–4 was processed with trypsin or MMP-2 as described under “Experimental Procedures” and then examined for cell adhesion assay (A) or flow cytometric analysis of β1 integrin activation (B) using K562 cells. A, effects of TNIIIA2 (20 μg/ml), rA1–4 (50 μg/ml), and rA1–4 processed with trypsin or MMP-2 on K562 cell adhesion (attachment) to FN without Mn2+ were investigated as in Fig. 3.

https://openalex.org/W2029378125,"Calmodulin (CaM) has been implicated in mediating the Ca(2+)-dependent regulation of gap junctions. This report identifies a CaM-binding motif comprising residues 136-158 in the intracellular loop of Cx43. A 23-mer peptide encompassing this CaM-binding motif was shown to bind Ca(2+)-CaM with 1:1 stoichiometry by using various biophysical approaches, including surface plasmon resonance, circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, and NMR. Far UV circular dichroism studies indicated that the Cx43-derived peptide increased its alpha-helical contents on CaM binding. Fluorescence and NMR studies revealed conformational changes of both the peptide and CaM following formation of the CaM-peptide complex. The apparent dissociation constant of the peptide binding to CaM in physiologic K(+) is in the range of 0.7-1 microM. Upon binding of the peptide to CaM, the apparent K(d) of Ca(2+) for CaM decreased from 2.9 +/- 0.1 to 1.6 +/- 0.1 microM, and the Hill coefficient n(H) increased from 2.1 +/- 0.1 to 3.3 +/- 0.5. Transient expression in HeLa cells of two different mutant Cx43-EYFP constructs without the putative Cx43 CaM-binding site eliminated the Ca(2+)-dependent inhibition of Cx43 gap junction permeability, confirming that residues 136-158 in the intracellular loop of Cx43 contain the CaM-binding site that mediates the Ca(2+)-dependent regulation of Cx43 gap junctions. Our results provide the first direct evidence that CaM binds to a specific region of the ubiquitous gap junction protein Cx43 in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner, providing a molecular basis for the well characterized Ca(2+)-dependent inhibition of Cx43-containing gap junctions."
https://openalex.org/W1972266691,"Recently the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of Clostridium difficile toxin B was solved (Reinert, D. J., Jank, T., Aktories, K., and Schulz, G. E. (2005) J. Mol. Biol. 351, 973-981). On the basis of this structure, we studied the functional role of several amino acids located in the catalytic center of toxin B. Besides the 286DXD288 motif and Trp102, which were shown to be necessary for Mn2+ and UDP binding, respectively, we identified by alanine scanning Asp270, Arg273, Tyr284, Asn384, and Trp520 as being important for enzyme activity. The amino acids Arg455, Asp461, Lys463, and Glu472 and residues of helix α17 (e.g. Glu449) of toxin B are essential for enzyme-protein substrate recognition. Introduction of helix α17 of toxin B into Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin inhibited modification of Ras subfamily proteins but enabled glucosylation of RhoA, indicating that helix α17 is involved in RhoA recognition by toxin B.

The data allow the design of a model of the interaction of the glucosyltransferase domain of toxin B with its protein substrate RhoA. Clostridium difficile toxin B is, besides toxin A, the major pathogenicity factor of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudo-membranous colitis. Whereas toxin A is a potent enterotoxin in animal models, toxin B is designated as a cytotoxin, which is usually 100- to 1000-fold more potent than toxin A in most types of cultured cells (1Von Eichel-Streiber C. Boquet P. Sauerborn M. Thelestam M. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 2Just I. Gerhard R. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

Toxin B has a molecular mass of 269 kDa and consists of at least three functional domains. The C terminus has a β-solenoid structure and is involved in receptor binding (4Ho J.G. Greco A. Rupnik M. Ng K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18373-18378Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The middle part of the toxin is suggested to be involved in translocation of the toxin into the target cell, and the N terminus possesses glucosyltransferase activity (5Hofmann F. Busch C. Prepens U. Just I. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11074-11078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). After binding of the toxin to a cell membrane receptor, the receptor-toxin complex is endocytosed. In acidic early endosomes, conformational changes of the toxin enforce membrane insertion and pore formation, which most likely participate in toxin translocation (6Barth H. Pfeifer G. Hofmann F. Maier E. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10670-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, only the glucosyltransferase domain and not the rest of the molecule is translocated into the cytosol of target cells (7Pfeifer G. Schirmer J. Leemhuis J. Busch C. Meyer D.K. Aktories K.

The middle region possesses protease activity and cleaves the N-terminal part of the toxin in the presence of inositol hexakisphosphate and releases the glucosyltransferase domain into the cytosol (9Egerer M.

Once in the cytosol, the glucosyltransferase domain of toxin B mono-O glucosylates low molecular mass GTPases of the Rho family, including RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 (11Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Glucosylation of Rho proteins inhibits the function of the switch proteins, most likely by inhibiting the conformational change into the active form of the GTPases. Thereby, Rho-dependent signaling is blocked (12Sehr P. Joseph G. Genth H. Just I. Pick E. Aktories K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5296-5304Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of toxin B has been solved recently (13Reinert D.J. Jank T. Aktories K. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and the structural requirements of the sugar substrate specificity have been determined (14Jank T. Reinert D.J. Giesemann T. Schulz G.E. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37833-37838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Here we studied the functional role of several amino acids located in or near the active center of toxin B and identified amino acid residues that are involved in protein substrate recognition. Materials—UDP-[14C]glucose (287.4 mCi/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Science; PCR primers were from Biochip Technologies (Freiburg, Germany). Toxin B from C. difficile VPI 10463 and lethal toxin (LT) 2The abbreviations used are: LT, lethal toxin of C. sordellii; PEI, polyethyleneimine; EBL, embryonic bovine lung. from C. sordellii 6018 and their recombinant catalytic domains were expressed and purified as described previously (14Jank T.

All other reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from commercial sources. Polymerase Chain Reactions—Amplification of the glucosyltransferase domain of toxin B of C. difficile VPI 10463 and the glucosyltransferase domain of C. sordellii 6018 was performed as described previously (5Hofmann F. Busch C. Prepens U. Just I. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11074-11078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis of Toxin Fragments—Quik-Change™ kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in combination with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase was used for the replacement of one to five nucleotides in the pGEX2T-LTcat or pGEX2T-Bcat plasmids. Primers were constructed as shown in the supplemental data. Corresponding plasmids were selected in Esche-richia coli XL1-Blue followed by transformation into E. coli BL-21 (DE3) (Invitrogen) for expression. Sequencing—All constructs of toxin B and LT fragments were checked by sequencing with ABI PRISM™ Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit and ABI 310 Cycle Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). Expression of Recombinant Proteins—Toxin fragments were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins from E. coli expression vector pGEX-2T (GE Healthcare) as previously reported (5Hofmann F. Busch C. Prepens U. Just I. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11074-11078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) was used for purification. Proteins were cleaved from glutathione S-transferase fusion protein with thrombin in TBP-150 elution buffer (thrombin 100 μg/ml, Tris-HCl 50 mm, KCl 150 mm, and β-mercaptoethanol 10 mm, pH 7.5) for at least 1 h at 4 °C. Thrombin was removed by binding to benzamidine-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). Recombinant GTP-binding proteins RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42, H-Ras, and RalA were prepared as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins as described (15Just I. Wilm M. Selzer J. Rex G. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13932-13936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Glucosylation Reaction—Recombinant GTP-binding proteins (50 μg/ml) were incubated with the indicated concentrations of recombinant toxin fragments and 10 μm UDP-[14C]sugars in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for the indicated times at 30 °C. Total volume was 20 μl. Labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics/GE Healthcare). UDP-Sugar Hydrolase Reaction—UDP-sugar hydrolysis was measured as described (15Just I. Wilm M. Selzer J. Rex G. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13932-13936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Toxin fragments and mutants were incubated with 20 μm UDP-[14C]sugar and 100 μm corresponding unlabeled UDP-sugar in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 μm bovine serum albumin, and 100 μm MnCl2. Total volume was 20 μl. Samples of 1 μl were taken at each time point and subjected to PEI (polyethyleneimine)-cellulose thin layer chromatography (Merck) with 0.2 mm LiCl as mobile phase to separate the hydrolyzed sugar from intact UDP-sugar. The plates were dried and analyzed by phosphorimaging analysis. Quantification was carried out with ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics/GE Healthcare). Determination of Kinetic Parameters—Initial rate data for the glycosyltransferase and glucohydrolase reactions were determined by varying the UDP-sugar concentrations from ∼0.1 to 4 × Km. For the glucosyltransferase reaction, the experiments were performed with a fixed Rac concentration of 14.3 μm. The Michaelis-Menten parameters were obtained by computer-assisted analysis of Lineweaver-Burk plots of initial velocities from at least three independent experiments with the curve-fitting function in Sigma plot (Systat Software, Inc.). Microinjection Studies—For microinjection, embryonic bovine lung (EBL) cells were seeded on CELLocate coverslips (Eppendorf) at ∼104 cells/dish and cultivated for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in humidified 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Microinjection was performed with Femtotips II and the microinjector 5242 and micromanipulator 5171 from Eppendorf. Amino Acid Residues Involved in Catalysis and Sugar Substrate Interaction—The glucosyltransferase located in the N-terminal domain of C. difficile belongs to the GT-A family of glycosyltransferases (13Reinert D.J. Jank T. Aktories K. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the conserved catalytic core of the glucosyltransferase domain in white. In Fig. 1, B and C, several amino acid residues that are in close proximity to the substrate UDP-glucose are indicated (note that UDP-glucose was found to be cleaved in the crystal structure of the GT domain of toxin B). Whereas the roles of the DXD motif (Asp286 and Asp288) and of tryptophan 102 have been already biochemically analyzed (16Busch C. Hofmann F. Selzer J. Munro J. Jeckel D. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19566-19572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), we studied the function of additional amino acids that are most likely involved in binding and/or interaction with the substrate UDP-glucose. In the following, the glucosyltransferase domains of C. difficile toxin B and of C. sordellii lethal toxin are referred to as toxin B and LT, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, exchange of Asp270, which appears to be involved in binding of sugar hydroxyl groups to asparagine or alanine, completely blocked or reduced the glucosyltransferases activity by ∼500-fold (Table 1A). Surprisingly there was no major change in the Km value (7.2 μm for the D270N mutant compared with 4.3 μm wild-type enzyme). To answer the question whether the mutation prevents the cytopathic effect of the toxin, we microinjected the recombinant enzyme domain of the toxin into EBL cells. Fig. 2I shows that the D270A mutant was no longer able to intoxicate cells. The mutation of tyrosine 284 to alanine even decreased kcat from 10.9 (wild-type) to 0.004 s−1 and also prevented the intoxication of EBL cells by microinjection (Fig. 2J). These findings indicate that the residues are directly involved in the catalytic transferase reaction. Reductions in enzyme activity were also observed for the alanine mutant of arginine 273. Here 0.16% residual activity remained.FIGURE 2Glucosyltransferase (A and B) and glucohydrolase activity (C and D) of mutants of the catalytic domain of toxin B.

Similar to findings for the transferase reaction, D270A, R273A, and Y284A did not exhibit any hydrolyzing activity compared with the wild-type enzyme. D270N showed a 1000-fold loss in activity; kcat dropped from 274.5 (wild-type) to 0.24 h−1. Once again the mutation leads to only minor changes in the Km values (22.3 μm in comparison with 12.6 μm for the wild-type enzyme). These findings are in line with the view that these residues are directly involved in the catalytic mechanism and/or in the binding of the sugar donor. In a second set of mutations we studied the consequences of the change of asparagine 139, serine 269, serine 518, and tryptophan 520 to the respective alanine mutants (Fig. 2B). With the exception of W520A, all other mutants, e.g. N139A, S269A, and S518A, only exhibited reduction in transferase activity of up to 10-fold (Fig. 2E). Similar results were obtained in the glucohydrolase reaction (Fig. 2, D and F). These findings indicate that these residues are most likely not directly involved in binding of the protein substrate or the sugar donor and do not participate in the catalytic reaction. By contrast, W520A exhibited >800-fold reduction in enzyme activity. The kcat dropped from 10.9 (wild-type) to 0.013 s−1. Also, the glucohydrolase activity was strongly reduced (Table 1B). Owing to the strong reduction in in vitro activity also, microinjection experiments with EBL cells were accomplished. We could not see any morphological cytopathic effects after injection of the recombinant W520A mutant (Fig. 2K). In addition, we studied the role of glutamate 515, which appears to be involved in the coordination of the manganese ion, having a distance to Mn2+ of only 2.2 Å (Fig. 1, B and C). Surprisingly, change of glutamate to glutamine had nearly no consequences for glucosyltransferase and glucohydrolase activity (Fig. 2, E and F). In addition, a change to alanine did not cause a major drop in enzyme activity. This supports the notion that the second aspartate residue from the DXD motif has the main function in coordination of manganese ion. Potential Nucleophilic Amino Acids Involved in Catalysis—Although the molecular reaction mechanism of inverting glucosyltransferases is reasonably well understood, this is not the case for retaining glucosyltransferases. Because double displacement is feasible, we tried to identify nucleophiles that might be involved in this type of reaction. To this end, the role of glutamate 472 was analyzed and the kinetics of the E472A and E472R mutants studied. As shown in Fig. 3, E472A exhibited glucosyltransferase and glucohydrolase activity comparable with that of the wild-type. The glucosyltransferase activity of E472R was reduced. However, the glucohydrolase activity was not changed (Fig. 3C), indicating that glutamate 472 is not essential for enzyme activity. Another potential nucleophile is asparagine 384, which is located in the loop between strands β9 and β10 on the β-face of the sugar moiety. The carbonyl group of Asn384 is in 3.5 Å distance and well directed to the anomeric C-atom of the glucose (Fig. 1B). Change of asparagine 384 to alanine decreased the kcat from 10.9 (wild-type) to 0.034 s−1, meaning a 300-fold reduction in catalytic activity (Table 1). We then changed the nucleophilicity of this asparagine by a change to aspartic acid. No major effect was observed with an ∼50-fold reduction in enzyme activity (Fig. 3B). Moreover, we tried to identify a stable intermediate with this mutant. However, we were not able to detect labeling of the enzyme in the presence of UDP-[14C]glucose (not shown). These data rather support the hypothesis that the glucosylation of Rho GTPases by toxin B follows a SNi-like mechanism (13Reinert D.J. Jank T. Aktories K. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). RhoA-Toxin B Interaction—The catalytic domain of toxin B can be characterized by a “front side,” which harbors the catalytic cleft where UDP-glucose binds, and by a “back side” of the protein, which is not directly involved in the interaction with the sugar donor. The front side should be involved in protein substrate recognition. So far, our understanding of the interaction of Rho GTPases with the catalytic domain of toxin B was based only on in silico docking modeling. Suggesting that hydrogen and ion bondings are involved in enzyme-protein substrate interaction, we changed serine, threonine, asparagine, and several charged residues that are located in this protein area. A further criterion for amino acid exchange was the fact that the residues were apparently not directly involved in UDP-glucose interaction. Moreover, we studied the glucosylation of RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 with the mutants and compared the results with the glucosylation of small GTPases by the catalytic domain of lethal toxin, which additionally modifies Ras subfamily proteins but not RhoA. Fig. 4 gives an overview of these studies. From 20 single amino acid mutants studied, five mutant proteins exhibited gross changes in Rho GTPase glucosylation compared with the wild-type catalytic domain. Essential amino acid residues for the modification of Rho GTPases were glutamate 449, arginine 455, aspartate 461, lysine 463, and glutamate 472. The mutant toxin B proteins R455E, D461R, K463E, and E472R exhibited a dramatic loss in modification of all Rho GTPases (Fig. 4, s-v) whereas the glucohydrolase activity was much less affected (Fig. 5), indicating that these residues were involved in Rho GTPase recognition. Mutant E449K strongly reduced glucosylation of RhoA and Cdc42, whereas modification of Rac was minorly reduced (Fig. 4r). Also, the glucohydrolase activity of this mutant was hardly affected (Fig. 5). Glutamate 449 is located in the middle of helix α17 of toxin B. This helix, covering residues Gly444 through Lys452 of toxin B, exhibits major differences in amino acid sequence in toxin B and LT, although the entire catalytic domain of both toxins is ∼90% similar. Therefore, we exchanged several amino acid residues and turned helix α17 of toxin B in three steps into that of LT (Fig. 6, A-C), and, vice versa, we turned this region of LT into that of toxin B (Fig. 6, D-F). Fig. 7 shows that the glucohydrolase activities of all these chimeras were not changed. Accordingly, the kcat and Km values of hydrolysis by toxin B-H17-C were unchanged (Table 1B). When helix α17 in toxin B was changed to that of LT, modification of RhoA decreased (Fig. 8A). The kcat for transferase activity was reduced ∼700-fold (Table 1A). A modification of Ras and Ral, which are substrates of LT, was never observed even at high concentrations of 1 μm of the chimeric toxin B (Fig. 8B). On the other hand, change of the respective amino acid residues in LT to that of toxin B caused reduction of modification of Ras by LT (Fig. 8C, upper panel). When the complete helix α17 of toxin B was introduced into LT, a slight but significant modification of RhoA was detectable that was not observed with wild-type LT (Fig. 8C, lower panel).FIGURE 5Glucohydrolase activity of the glucosyltransferase domains of toxin B mutants E449K, E472R, D461R, K463E, and E455R.

C, glucosylation of H-Ras (1 μg) by the catalytic domain of LT and the helix α17 mutants (LT H17-A, LT H17-B, LT H17-C; each 10 nm, upper panel) and RhoA (1 μg) by the LT constructs (each 100 nm, lower panel). Radiolabeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Deduced from the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of toxin B, we identified several amino acid residues involved in catalysis of the glucosyltransferase reaction and/or binding of sugar substrate or protein substrate. The role of the well known conserved DXD motif and tryptophan 102 of toxin B have been characterized in detail previously (16Busch C. Hofmann F. Selzer J. Munro J. Jeckel D. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19566-19572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 17Busch C. Hofmann F. Gerhard R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13228-13234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and the functions of these residues were confirmed by crystal structure analysis (13Reinert D.J. Jank T. Aktories K. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Here we present a biochemical analysis of the functional roles of several additional amino acid residues that have been suggested to be involved in catalysis and/or in sugar substrate binding from crystal structure analysis of the catalytic domain of toxin B. We identified Asp270, Arg273, Tyr284, Asn384, and Trp520 as essential residues. The mutants R273A and D270A exhibited a 600- to >1000-fold reduced enzymatic activity compared with wild-type toxin. This supports the functional importance of these residues. In line with this finding, we observed that the D270A mutant was not able to induce cytopathic effects after microinjection. The loss of activity observed with these mutant proteins is explained by their role in orientating glucose of the donor substrate, which is achieved in cooperation with Asp286 from the DXD motif. Negishi et al. (18Negishi M. Dong J. Darden T.A. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) characterized the arginine (e.g. Arg273) and aspartic acid (e.g. Asp286) residues bonded to the 3-OH group of the donor sugar as GT-A triad, which is conserved in many enzymes of this family of glycosyltransferases. Also known in other glycosyltransferases and glycosidases is bidentate hydrogen bonding of carbonyl groups with the vicinal hydroxyl groups of an active site sugar in which an aspartic acid residue is involved (19Persson K. Ly H.D. Dieckelmann M. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 20Uitdehaag J.C. Mosi R. Kalk K.H. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Withers S.G. Dijkstra B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 21Brayer G.D. Sidhu G. Maurus R. Rydberg E.H. Braun C. Wang Y. Nguyen N.T. Overall C.M. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4778-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Here the acidic residues are involved in the distortion of the sugar ring toward the intermediate or transition state conformation. Secondly, a negative potential is achieved in the catalytic site stabilizing oxocarbenium ion-like structures. In toxin B this might be achieved by Asp270, which bonds to the 4′- and 6′-OH group of the glucose. These results confirm that catalysis is enabled by the distinct interplay of a network of conserved residues in the catalytic site that serve to stabilize the transition states. The very strong reduction in enzyme activity of the Y284A mutant cannot be explained by an impaired sugar substrate interaction via the 2′-hydroxyl group of the ribose, because of the distance of 3.3 Å from the hydroxyl group of Tyr284 to the 2′-hydroxyl group of the ribose. Secondly, the Km value for UDP-glucose is not dramatically changed, whereas the kcat is reduced >2000-fold (Table 1). We re-evaluated possible interactions of Tyr284 by means of the crystal structure of toxin B (13Reinert D.J. Jank T. Aktories K. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and determined a distance between Tyr284 and Asp286 of 2.76 Å. Asp286 is part of the DXD motif, and therefore it is feasible that Tyr284 has a pivotal role in positioning this important residue for Mn2+-dependent catalysis. A role of Mn2+ in catalysis has been suggested for inverting GT-A glycosyltransferases, where it acts as an acid catalyst and appears to be involved in conformational changes of the so-called “flexible loop” that might be involved in product release (22Breton C. Snajdrova L. Jeanneau C. Koca J. Imberty A. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 29R-37RCrossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 23Qasba P.K. Ramakrishnan B. Boeggeman E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 53-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). A function of the DXD motif and of the divalent cation not only in substrate binding but also in catalysis of retaining enzymes has to be determined. Change of tryptophan 520 to alanine largely impaired enzyme activity and again prevented cellular toxic effects. This residue binds to the oxygen of β-phosphate of UDP-glucose and is located on the putative flexible loop (amino acids 510-523) (23Qasba P.K. Ramakrishnan B. Boeggeman E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 53-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is underlined by the fact that an alanine mutant shows almost no change in Km value, whereas the turnover of the enzyme (kcat) was reduced by ∼800-fold (Table 1A). Additionally, the importance of this region in enzyme activity explains previous findings that rather small deletions of the C terminus of the catalytic domain cause loss of enzyme activity (5Hofmann F. Busch C. Prepens U. Just I. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11074-11078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of retaining glucosyltransferases is not clear. A plausible explanation would be a double displacement mechanism, which, however, depends on the presence of a nucleophilic amino acid close to the anomeric carbon of the donor substrate. As possible candidates for a nucleophilic attack of the anomeric carbon of UDP-glucose, we studied glutamate 472 and asparagine 384. At a position very similar to Glu472 in toxin B, many GT-A glycosyltransferases possess conserved nucleophilic residues. For example, Glu472 could be equivalent to the nucleophilic amino acid aspartate 190 in LgtC (24Lairson L.L. Chiu C.P. Ly H.D. He S. Wakarchuk W.W. Strynadka N.C. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28339-28344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), glutamate 317 in α3GalT (25Gastinel L.N. Bignon C. Misra A.K. Hindsgaul O. Shaper J.H. Joziasse D.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), or aspartate 162 in glycogenin (26Hurley T.D. Stout S. Miner E. Zhou J. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23892-23899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, changes of Glu472 in toxin B did not cause a major drop in enzyme activity, indicating no essential role in the catalytic reaction. The same was the case for mutation of residue Asn384, which is located 3.5 Å from the anomeric carbon of glucose and well positioned to perform a nucleophilic attack in terms of angle and direction. Asn384 would react as a glycosyl acetimidate intermediate in analogy to the intramolecular mechanism of N-acetylhexosaminidases (27Davies G.J. Sinnott M.L. Withers S.G. Sinnott M.L. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis. Academic Press, London1998: 119-208Google Scholar, 28Zechel D.L. Withers S.G. Acc. Chem. Res. 2000; 33: 11-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, the alanine mutant showed only a 300-fold reduced activity. Typically, equivalent mutations of nucleophilic amino acids in retaining glycosidases reduce kcat values by at least 105-106 times (27Davies G.J. Sinnott M.L. Withers S.G. Sinnott M.L. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis. Academic Press, London1998: 119-208Google Scholar, 28Zechel D.L. Withers S.G. Acc. Chem. Res. 2000; 33: 11-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these data rather support our previous suggestion (13Reinert D.J. Jank T. Aktories K. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and favor the model that the retaining glucosylation catalyzed by toxin B follows a single front-side displacement reaction also known as SNi-like mechanism. Our studies on the protein-substrate interaction site of the glucosyltransferase domain of toxin B revealed that residues Arg455, Asp461, Lys463, and Glu472 are essential for recognition of Rho GTPases. Importantly, all these residues were not essential for glucohydrolase activity. The mutant toxin B proteins R455E, D461R, K463E, and E472R exhibited reduced glucosylation of RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42, indicating a general role in substrate recognition and/or interaction. The same was the case for Glu449. Glu449 is located in helix α17 of toxin B, which is a lysine in the case of C. sordellii lethal toxin. Change of this residue to lysine reduced RhoA and Cdc42 glucosylation but the mutant protein was still able to modify Rac. Modification of Ras or Ral, which are main substrates for lethal toxin, could not be achieved by the point mutant. This led to the question whether additional residues around Glu449 are required for the substrate specificity of lethal toxin. Therefore, helix α17 chimeras of toxin B and of lethal toxin were constructed. On both sides exchange of helix α17 resulted in a strong reduction of glucosylation of their natural substrates (Fig. 8). Strikingly, lethal toxin with the whole helix α17 exchanged to toxin B was able to modify RhoA to a certain extent (Fig. 8C). The data indicate that helix α17 is essential for substrate recognition, but this region of LT introduced into toxin B is not sufficient for modification of Ras. Thus, Ras needs additional residues for recognition by the clostridial glucosylating toxins. Moreover, modification of Rac was decreased in mutant toxins, indicating that exchange of helix α17 of toxin B by the equivalent residues of LT may cause additional effects in the structure of toxin B. Accordingly, cell intoxication induced by microinjection of toxin B that harbored helix α17 from LT was slower than with the catalytic domain of wild-type toxin B (not shown). Deduced from the above-mentioned findings and recent crystal structure analysis of the catalytic domain of toxin B, we suggest a first model for the interaction of RhoA with toxin B (Fig. 9). This model is based on the docking programs Hex and FTDOCK in consideration of amino acids Arg455, Asp461, Lys463, and Glu472 as well as helix α17, which are all important for Rho GTPase interaction with toxin B but have no influence on glucohydrolase activity. This model is also compatible with amino acid residues Thr37 and Ser73 of RhoA, which have been recently identified to be important for interaction with the toxin (11Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 29Jank T. Pack U. Giesemann T. Schmidt G. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19527-19535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The model implies that the N-terminal four helices of toxin B, which might be involved in membrane interaction (deduced from the equivalent function of the N terminus of LT) (30Mesmin B. Robbe K. Geny B. Luton F. Brandolin G. Popoff M.R. Antonny B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49876-49882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), are paralleled by the C terminus of RhoA, which interacts with the membrane via its isoprenylated C terminus. Moreover, the above model suggests that the insert region of RhoA is located above helix α21 and a loop that is formed by residues 162-168 in toxin B. Accordingly, the insert region does not interfere with the interaction site of RhoA and toxin B. In line with this hypothesis, we observed recently by using the chimeras Ras124RhoA136Ras and Rac124Rho136Rac that the insert region has no effect on the substrate specificity of toxin B and LT, respectively (not shown). Taken together, we identified amino acids in the glucosyltransferase domain of toxin B that are essential for enzyme activity and substrate recognition. These findings are likely to be important for the understanding of the activity and specificity of other members of the family of clostridial glucosylating toxins.

https://openalex.org/W1986098867,"Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans has an arsenic resistance operon that is controlled by an As(III)-responsive transcriptional repressor, AfArsR, a member of the ArsR/SmtB family of metalloregulators. AfArsR lacks the As(III) binding site of the ArsRs from plasmid R773 and Escherichia coli, which have a Cys32-Val-Cys34-Asp-Leu-Cys37 sequence in the DNA binding site. In contrast, it has three cysteine residues, Cys95, Cys96, and Cys102, that are not present in the R773 and E. coli ArsRs. The results of direct As(III) binding measurements and x-ray absorption spectroscopy show that these three cysteine residues form a 3-coordinate As(III) binding site. DNA binding studies indicate that binding of As(III) to these cysteine residues produces derepression. Homology modeling indicates that As(III) binding sites in AfArsR are located at the ends of antiparallel C-terminal helices in each monomer that form a dimerization domain. These results suggest that the As(III)-S3 binding sites in AfArsR and R773 ArsR arose independently at spatially distinct locations in their three-dimensional structures.

The metalloid arsenic is a ubiquitous environmental toxin that is ranked first on Superfund List of Hazardous Substances (www.atsdr.cdc.gov/cercla/05list.html). Nearly every organism has genes for arsenic detoxification (1Bhattacharjee H. Rosen B.P. Nies D.H. Simon S. Molecular Microbiology of Heavy Metals. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg/New York2007: 371-406Google Scholar). In bacteria, arsenic resistance is most frequently conferred by chromosomal or plasmid-encoded ars operons that are controlled by members of the ArsR/SmtB family of transcriptional repressors (2Pennella M.A. Giedroc D.P. Biometals. 2005; 18: 413-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 3Xu C. Rosen B.P. Sarkar B. Metals and Genetics. Plenum Press, New York1999: 5-19Crossref Google Scholar). The well characterized plasmid R773 and Escherichia coli chromosomal ArsRs are homodimers that have a Cys32-Val-Cys34-Asp-Leu-Cys37 sequence at the start of the helix-loop-helix DNA binding site (4Shi W. Wu J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19826-19829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The three sulfur thiolates of the cysteine residues form an S3 binding site for As(III), and binding of metalloid is presumed to cause a conformational change in the repressor leading to dissociation from the DNA and hence derepression (5Shi W. Dong J. Scott R.A. Ksenzenko M.Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9291-9297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This site is congruent with the 4-coordinate (S4) Cd(II) binding site of the CadC repressor (6Ye J. Kandegedara A. Martin P. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4214-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and we have termed these Type 1 metal binding site. CadC also has a C-terminal non-regulatory Zn(II) binding site that is formed by Asp101 and His103 from one monomer and His114′ and Glu117′ from the other monomer at the dimerization domain. This site corresponds to the Zn(II) regulatory site of SmtB, and we have termed these Type 2 metal binding sites. The Type 1 and Type 2 sites have also been called α3N and α5 sites (7Busenlehner L.S. Weng T.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. Giedroc D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 685-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), but these designations are imprecise because they were based on an incomplete structure of SmtB. Recently Butcher et al. (8Butcher B.G. Deane S.M. Rawlings D.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 1826-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) identified an ars operon in Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans in which arsRC genes are transcribed divergently from arsBH genes. They termed the ArsR homologue “atypical” because it does not contain the CXC(X)2C motif in the DNA binding site (9Butcher B.G. Rawlings D.E. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3983-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Deletion of the last 19 amino acid residues had no effect on arsenic regulation, but deletion of an additional 28 residues resulted in loss of regulation from the arsBH promoter. Within that sequence is a vicinal cysteine pair, Cys95 and Cys96 that is conserved in closely related homologues. Because vicinal cysteine pairs can form the strongest binding site found in nature for trivalent metalloids, we investigated the involvement of that cysteine pair and a third residue, Cys102, in transcriptional regulation by trivalent metalloids. The data strongly support the idea that the three cysteine residues are ligands to As(III) and form an S3 site in which each sulfur atom is 2.25 Å from the arsenic atom. The results of DNA binding studies indicate that this is the inducer binding site. This As(III) binding site does not correspond to known metal binding sites in other members of the ArsR/SmtB family, showing that As(III) binding sites can arise by convergent evolution, even in otherwise homologous proteins. Strains, Plasmids, Media, and Reagents—E. coli cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) at 37 °C supplemented with 125 μg/ml ampicillin, 25 μg/ml kanamycin, 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline, or 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol, as required. E. coli strains DH5α (Promega, Madison, WI), XL1-Blue (F′ proA+B+ lacIq Δ(lacZ) M15 Tn10(tetR) recA1 endA1 gyr96 thi-1 hsdR17 supE44 relA1 lac), were used for plasmid construction, replication, and mutagenesis. Plasmids pB2lacZ, pB3lacZ, and E. coli strain ACSH501q (rspl Δ(lac-pro) (F′ traD36 proAB lacIq ΔM15) Δars::cam) (9Butcher B.G. Rawlings D.E. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3983-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were used for analysis of AfArsR function in vivo. Strain Top10 (Invitrogen) was used for protein expression. Bacterial growth was monitored by measuring the A600 nm. All reagents were obtained from commercial sources. Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—For expression of AfArsR from A. ferrooxidans in E. coli, plasmid pBADarsR, in which the arsR gene is under the control of the arabinose promoter and has the sequence for a C-terminal His tag, was constructed. Two pairs of primers were used to amplify the arsR gene from plasmid pB2lacZ. The first pair was 5′-GTCCCGGGTACCGTGGCAGCAATTTTCTG-3′ (changed site underlined) and 5′-AATACCATGGAACCACTACAAGACCCTGC-3′ (NcoI site underlined). The second pair was 5′-GGTTTGTCGACCTGGTTTCCTTCCTGGAC-3′ (SalI site underlined) and 5′-CAGAAAATTGCTGCCACGGTACCCGGGAC-3′ (changed site underlined). Introduction of the CAT codon eliminated the NcoI site in arsR without changing the ArsR amino acid sequence. The two PCR fragments generated with the first set of primers that were gel purified (Qiagen Corp., Valencia, CA) were used as template, and the second set of primers were used for the second PCR amplification. A 0.35-kbp PCR fragment was gel purified, digested with NcoI and SalI, and ligated into vector plasmid pBAD/Myc-His-C that had been digested with the same restriction enzymes, generating plasmid pBADarsR. Cysteine-to-serine mutants were constructed by using a QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the following forward and reverse primers (mutation sites underlined). The primers were: C95S, 5′-GCACAGTCCCGGGTACCGTGGCAGGAATTTTCTGTGAGATACGCG-3′ and 5′-CGCGTATCTCACAGAAAATTCCTGCCACGGTACCCGGGACTGTGC-3′; C96S, 5′-GCACAGTCCCGGGTACCGTGGGAGCAATTTTCTGTGAGATACGCG-3′ and 5′-CGCGTATCTCACAGAAAATTGCTCCCACGGTACCCGGGACTGTGC-3′; C96S/C96S, 5′-GCACAGTCCCGGGTACCGTGGGAGGAATTTTCTGTGAGATACGCG-3′ and 5′-CGCGTATCTCACAGAAAATTCCTCCCACGGTACCCGGGACTGTGC-3′; C102S, 5′-GGTTTCACCGGATAGGGCAGAGTCCCGGGTACCGTGG-3′ and 5′-CCACGGTACCCGGGACTCTGCCCTATCCGGTGAAACC-3′. Each mutation was confirmed by sequencing of the entire arsR gene. Cysteine-to-alanine mutants were also constructed, and the results were similar to those with serine substitutions, so no data are shown for the alanine substitutions. A lacZ reporter plasmid was constructed from plasmid pMC1403-B3lacZ (9Butcher B.G. Rawlings D.E. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3983-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), in which lacZ was fused to the A. ferrooxidans arsB promoter. Plasmid pMC1403-B3lacZ was digested with BstBI (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and vector plasmid pACYC184 was digested with Bsu36I. The fragments were filled in with DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), extracted twice with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and precipitated with 1/10 volume of 3 m sodium acetate and 3 volumes of 95% ethanol at -20 °C. Vacuum-dried DNA was suspended in the appropriate restriction enzyme buffer and digested with EcoRI and gel purified. The lacZ-arsO fragment was ligated into pACYC184 to form plasmid pACYC184lacZ-arsO. The presence of the insert was verified by digestion with SphI and EcoRI. To assay lacZ activity, a single colony of E. coli strain ACSH501q (rspl Δ(lac-pro) (F′ traD36 proAB lacIq ΔM15) Δars::cam) bearing plasmids pBADarsR and pACYC184arsO-lacZ was inoculated into 5 ml of LB medium supplemented with 125 μg/ml ampicilin, 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Late exponential phase cells were diluted 50-fold into 20 ml of LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotics and induced with 0.2% arabinose at 37 °C. For constitutive expression of lacZ while repressing afarsR expression, 0.2% glucose was added instead of arabinose. For induction by As(III), 25 μm sodium arsenite and 0.2% arabinose were added together. Growth was monitored as A600 nm and continued until the cultures reached stationary phase. To assay β-galactosidase activity, a portion of the culture was harvested and suspended in buffer consisting of 40 mm Na2HPO4, 60 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgSO4 at an A600 nm of 0.5. An aliquot (0.2 ml) of cells was vigorously mixed with 10 μl of 1% SDS and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The reaction was initiated by addition of 0.5 ml of 0.1 mg/ml of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside, and the rate of hydrolysis monitored at 420 nm. Relative activity was calculated as the percentage of the activity of uninduced cells. AfArsR Purification—Cells of E. coli strain Top10 bearing wild type or mutant pBADarsR plasmids were grown at 37 °C in LB medium to an A600 nm of 0.5, at which point 0.2% arabinose was added as inducer. The cells were grown for another 4 h and harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, washed once with buffer A (50 mm MOPS 2The abbreviations used are: MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MMTS, methyl methanethiosulfonate; XAS, x-ray absorption spectroscopy; XANES, x-ray absorption near edge structure; EXAFS, extended X-ray absorption fine structure. -KOH, pH 7.5, containing 20% (w/v) glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), and suspended in 5 ml of buffer A/g of wet cells. The cells were lysed by a single pass through a French Press cell at 20,000 p.s.i. and 2.5 μl/g of wet cell of diisopropyl fluorophosphate was added immediately. Membranes and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant solution was loaded at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min onto a Ni(II)-nitrilotriacetic acid column pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was then washed with 150 ml of buffer A followed by elution with 60 ml of buffer A with the concentration of imidazole increased to 0.2 m. The eluted protein was concentrated with a 10-kDa cut-off Amicon Ultracentrifugal filter (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). The concentrated protein was further purified by gel filtration using Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences) in a 45 × 1.5-cm column with a total bed volume of 80 ml. The protein was eluted with buffer A containing 0.2 mm EDTA at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. AfArsR was identified by SDS-PAGE (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Fractions containing AfArsR were concentrated by ultrafiltration centrifugation. Protein concentrations were estimated using the method of Bradford (12Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) or from the A280 nm using a calculated extinction coefficient of 4,200 cm−1 (13Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). AfArsR Molecular Mass Determination—The molecular mass of wild type and mutant AfArsRs was measured using a high pressure liquid chromatograph (PerkinElmer Series 200) with synchropak GPC300 column and monitored at A280 nm. Protein was eluted with a buffer consisting of 50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.5, containing 20% glycerol and 0.5 m NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was calibrated with 20 μl of a mixture of gel filtration calibration standards 17-0442-01 (Amersham Biosciences) of blue dextran 2000, ribonuclease, chymotrypsinogen A, ovalbumin, and albumin (5 mg/ml of each). Wild type and mutant AfArsRs (20 μl of 5 mg/ml) were injected, and elution was monitored at A280 nm. For each protein, Kav was calculated as Kav = (Ve - V0)/(Vt - V0). Methyl Methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) Modification—MMTS modification was performed as described (14Bhattacharjee H. Li J. Ksenzenko M.Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11245-11250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Reducing agents were removed from AfArsR prior to reaction with MMTS by two passages through a Bio-Gel P-6 Micro Bio-Spin column (Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with degassed 50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, and 0.5 m NaCl. AfArsR was then incubated with MMTS at a ratio of 6 eq per cysteine residue. The concentration of free cysteine thiolate was determined by titration with 0.1 mm 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in a buffer consisting of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 4 m guanidine-HCl and 0.2-2 mg/ml of AfArsR. After 5 min, the amount of free -SH was calculated from A412 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 13,600 m−1 cm−1 (15Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). Measurement of Metalloid Binding—The buffer used for purification of AfArsR was exchanged with a buffer containing 50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7, using a Bio-Gel P-6 Micro Bio-Spin column (Bio-Rad). Buffers were degassed by bubbling with argon. Purified protein (10 μm) was incubated at 4 °C with the indicated concentrations of sodium arsenite or potassium antimonyl tartrate. After 1 h, each sample was passed through a Bio-Gel P-6 column pre-exchanged with the same buffer. Portions (25 μl) were diluted with 2% HNO3, and the quantity of metalloid measured by inductively coupled mass spectrometry with a PerkinElmer ELAN 9000. Antimony standard solutions in the range of 0.5-10 ppb in 2% HNO3 were obtained from Ultra Scientific, Inc. (North Kingstown, RI). X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS)—XAS samples of wild type and C102S AfArsR were prepared in 50 mm MOPS, 0.5 m NaCl, and 30% glycerol, pH 7.5. Multiple reproducible samples were prepared at substoichiometric As(III):protein ratios at an As(III) concentration of 1 mm. Solution samples were loaded in Lucite cells, wrapped in Kapton tape, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. XAS data were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) beamlines 9-3 and 10-2. Harmonic rejection was achieved by utilizing a harmonic rejection mirror on beamline 9-3 and detuning the Si (220) double-crystal monochromator on beamline 10-2. During data collection, samples were maintained at 10 K using Oxford Instrument continuous flow liquid helium cryostats at both locations. Fluorescence excitation spectra were collected using a 30-element and a 13-element germanium solid-state array detector at beamlines 9-3 and 10-2, respectively. XAS spectra were measured using 5 eV steps in the pre-edge region (11,625-11,825 eV), 0.25 eV steps in the edge region (11,850-11,900 eV), and 0.05 Å−1 increments in the extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) region out to a k range of 13 Å−1, integrating from 2 to 20 s in a k-weighted manner in the EXAFS region for a total scan length of ∼35 min. X-ray energies were calibrated using an arsenic foil absorption spectrum collected simultaneously with the protein data. The first inflection point for the arsenic foil edge was assigned to 11,867 eV. Data reduction and analysis followed previously published protocols (16Ramirez-Solis A. Mukopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. Stemmler T.L. Inorg. Chem. 2004; 43: 2954-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Prior to data reduction and averaging, each fluorescence channel of each scan was examined for spectral anomalies. Published XAS spectra represent the average of 5 scans. Spectra were processed using the Mac OS X version of the EXAFSPAK program suite integrated with Feff 7.2 software for theoretical model generation. Data reduction involved fitting the pre-edge spectral region with a second order polynomial and the EXAFS region with a cubic spline constructed of three regions. Following spline subtraction, EXAFS data were converted into k space using an E0 of 11,885 eV. The k3 weighted EXAFS were Fourier transformed and simulated. The final published fitting results are, however, from analysis of the raw unfiltered data. Data were fit using single scattering amplitude and phase functions generated using Feff. Single scattering Feff models were calculated for oxygen, sulfur, and arsenic coordination to simulate arsenic-ligand nearest neighbor environments. Values for the scale factor and E0, obtained previously from fitting crystallographically characterized As(III) model compounds, were equal to 0.98 and -10, respectively (16Ramirez-Solis A. Mukopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. Stemmler T.L. Inorg. Chem. 2004; 43: 2954-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). During fitting analysis, the scale factor and E0 were fixed, the coordination number was fixed but manually varied, and values for the bond length and Debye-Waller factor were allowed to vary freely. The lowest mean square deviation between data and fit, corrected for the number of degrees of freedom (F′), was used to judge best-fit EXAFS simulations and to justify addition of supplementary interactions within the simulations. Circular Dichroism Measurements—Circular dichroism (CD) spectra from 190 to 260 nm were acquired with a spectrometer from Olis Inc. (Bogart, GA) at 20 °C using a 0.2-cm cell at 1.8-nm intervals. Three scans were averaged for each spectrum. Wild and mutant AfArsRs were assayed at 10 μm in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. DNA Mobility Shift Assays—DNA mobility shift assays were performed as follows. A 199-bp DNA fragment was amplified by PCR from plasmid pB2lacZ by using the primers 5′-GGCGAGGCCAGGGCCTCCAGGC-3′ and 5′-AAAACGACGGGATCCAGGG-3′. The PCR fragment was gel purified, and 40 ng was mixed with the indicated concentrations of purified wild type or mutant AfArsRs, with or without As(III), in a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 80 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.75 μm bovine serum albumin for 30 min on ice in a total volume 20 μl. The DNA/AfArsR mixture was separated by PAGE on a 6% nondenaturating gel at 4 °C for 30 min and stained with SYBR Green (Invitrogen). DNA Footprinting—Complementary DNA primers in which one was labeled at the 5′ end with light-sabre green fluorescence (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA), as indicated, were used to amplify the A. ferrooxidans ars operator region. Two pairs of primers were used, one for determining the arsRC direction, and the other for the arsBH direction. The primer pairs used were: arsRC, 5′-GGCGAGGCCAGGGCCTCCAGGC-3′ (labeled) and 5′-AAAACGACGGGATCCAGGG-3′; arsBH, 5′-GGCGAGGCCAGGGCCTCCAGGC-3′ and 5′-GTAACGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACG-3′ (labeled). The PCR products were purified with a NucleoSpin 635961 kit (Clontech) and digested with DNase I (Sigma) in a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 80 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.75 μm bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm MgCl2. After optimization, 0.45 μm DNA and 0.16 Kunitz units of DNase I were used in a 20-μl reaction volume at room temperature for 30 min. As a negative control 5 μm bovine serum albumin was used in place of AfArsR. The reaction was terminated by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. The DNA was precipitated by addition of 2 μl of 3 m sodium acetate, 2 μl of 0.1 m EDTA, 1 μl of glycogen, and 60 μl of 95% ethanol (at -20 °C) and pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The pellet was washed once with 0.2 ml of 70% ethanol. The DNA was vacuum dried for 20 min and suspended in sequencing buffer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) to which 0.5 μl of DNA standard was added (CEQ DNA Size Standard-400 P/N 608098, Beckman Coulter). Then, samples were loaded into the 96-well sample plate and assayed with a CEQ 2000XL DNA sequencer (Beckman Coulter). The running conditions were: capillary temperature, 58 °C; denaturation at 90 °C for 2 min; injection at 2 kV for 30 s; and separation at 6 kV for 35 min. The data were analyzed with CEQ 2000 fragment analysis software. Fluorescence Anisotropy—DNA binding studies by fluorescence anisotropy using a Photon Technology International spectrofluorometer were fitted with polarizers in the L format. Changes in anisotropy were calculated after each addition using the supplied Felix32 software. Complementary 30-mer oligonucleotides, one of which was labeled at the 5′ end with fluorescein, were synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA) based on the DNA footprinting results: 6-FAM-5′-ATCCACGAATATTTCTTGCAGTATTGACAA-3′ and 5-TAGGTGCTTATAAAGAACGTCATAACTGTT-3′. Desalted DNA was annealed at 94 °C for 5 min, cooled to room temperature, and stored in aliquots at -20 °C. Anisotropy measurements were performed in a buffer consisting of 10 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 15% glycerol, and 20 nm DNA. Wild type or mutant AfArsRs were titrated with 1.7 ml of 50 nm fluorescein-labeled ars O/P DNA. AfArsR was metallated by mixing 1 m eq of AfArsR monomer with the indicated concentrations of As(II) or Sb(III) under anaerobic conditions. Contribution of AfArsR Cysteine Residues to Metalloregulation in Vivo—An alignment of the primary sequence of homologues of A. ferroxidans ArsR shows that the six closest homologues have a vicinal cysteine pair corresponding to Cys95-Cys96 in AfArsR, and a single additional cysteine, which is Cys102 in AfArsR (Fig. 1). The codons for these three cysteine residues were altered alone and in combination with serine or alanine codons in plasmid pBAD-RT-arsR, with expression controlled by the ars promoter. (Both types of substitutions at each of the three positions had similar effects, so only results with serine mutants are shown.) The mutated arsR genes were co-transformed into E. coli strain ACSH501q, in which the chromosomal arsRBC operon was deleted (17Carlin A. Shi W. Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), with plasmid pACYC184-lacZ-arsO, in which a lacZ gene was introduced under control of the A. ferroxidans arsBH promoter. Expression of lacZ was constitutive when wild type afarsR was repressed by growth on glucose (Fig. 2). When wild type afarsR was expressed by addition of arabinose, lacZ was repressed, and addition of 25 μm sodium arsenite resulted in derepression of lacZ. Mutagenesis of the codons for either Cys95 or Cys96 to serine codons (or both) resulted in constitutive lacZ expression, suggesting that these mutants are unable to bind to the ars promoter. Curiously, addition of sodium arsenite resulted in lower expression. On the other hand, a C102S mutant was able to repress in the absence of metalloid and exhibited partial derepression in its presence, suggesting that Cys102 may contribute to but is not required for metalloregulation. Cys95, Cys96, and Cys102 Form a Three-coordinate As(III) Binding Site—The three single cysteine mutants and the C95A/C96A double mutants were expressed and purified as His6-tagged proteins. Each eluted from a gel filtration column at a position corresponding to 31 kDa (Fig. 3). Thus the substitutions did not interfere with dimerization, indicating that the cysteine residues are not required for dimer formation. Circular dichroism spectroscopy in the far UV showed that each protein is highly helical, with negative maxima peaks at 208 and 220 nm (Fig. 4). The cysteine substitutions did not affect the CD spectra significantly, indicating that the overall helical content was not affected by the mutations. Addition of As(III) to the wild type protein also did not change the spectrum, indicating that binding of inducer does not produce a substantial alteration in the overall structure.FIGURE 4Circular dichroism spectroscopy of wild type and mutant AfArsRs. CD spectra were collected with wild type AfArsR (○), or wild type AfArsR with 30 μm sodium arsenite (•), C95S/C96S (▾), C96S (▵), and C102S (□), respectively. The differences below 200 nm are likely due to slight differences in protein concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Binding of As(III) and Sb(III) by the wild type and mutant AfArsRs was assayed (Fig. 5). Wild type AfArsR bound 1 mol of As(III) or Sb(III) per monomer. The C95S, C96S, and C95S/C96S mutants did not bind either trivalent metalloid with high affinity. The C102S mutant bound both As(III) and Sb(III), but the affinity was lower than the wild type and too low to calculate accurately. When either the wild type or C102S proteins was treated with MMTS, which specifically forms a methyl disulfide with cysteine residues, binding of both metalloids was reduced to background levels. These results are consistent with a low affinity metalloid binding site composed of Cys95 and Cys96, and that the presence of Cys102 converts it into a high affinity site. The nature of the binding site was investigated in structural detail using XAS. XANES analysis indicates arsenic in both the wild type and C102S proteins is stably bound as As(III) (supplemental Fig. S1). The observed values for the first inflection point energies are 11868.87 and 11869.33 eV for wild type and C102S, respectively, consistent with observed values for As(III) systems (16Ramirez-Solis A. Mukopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. Stemmler T.L. Inorg. Chem. 2004; 43: 2954-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The EXAFS fitting results are most consistent with trivalent arsenic being maintained in a 3-coordinate structural environment in both wild type and mutant proteins (Fig. 6). Simulation analysis for wild type AfArsR were best fit with a single nearest neighbor ligand environment constructed only with sulfur atoms (Table 1). Attempts to simulate these data with a mixed sulfur and oxygen/nitrogen nearest neighbor environment were unsuccessful. In contrast, simulation analysis for C102S showed the nearest neighbor environment in the mutant was constructed by one oxygen and two sulfur atoms, for an averaged environment of As-S2O. The average As-S bond length of 2.24 Å in the mutant is identical to that seen in the wild type, whereas the As-O bond length of 1.76 Å is equal to that obtained for a hydroxyl bound to As(III) (16Ramirez-Solis A. Mukopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. Stemmler T.L. Inorg. Chem. 2004; 43: 2954-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Attempts to simulate long-range scattering (R > 2.5 Å) were unsuccessful in both samples. The most reasonable interpretation of these data is that in wild type AfArsR, Cys95, Cys96, and Cys102 form an S3 binding site for As(III), with two sites in the homodimer. In C102S, one of the coordinated sulfur atoms is replaced by an oxygen-based ligand for an S2O binding site for As(III). The short As-O bond length in C102S matches that expected for a bound hydroxyl and is about 0.1 Å shorter than that expected for a bound water or a serine hydroxyl group (16Ramirez-Solis A. Mukopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. Stemmler T.L. Inorg. Chem. 2004; 43: 2954-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Summary of AfArsR EXAFS fitting resultsLigand environmentaIndependent metal-ligand scattering environmentSampleFit No.AtombScattering atoms: O (oxygen), N (nitrogen), and S (sulfur)R (Å)cMetal-ligand bond length in AC.N.dMetal-ligand coordination numberσ2eDebye-Waller factor in Å × 103AtombScattering atoms: O (oxygen), N (nitrogen), and S (sulfur)R (Å)cMetal-ligand bond length"
https://openalex.org/W2003446426,"Chemotherapy resistance accounts for the high mortality rates in patients with advanced cancers. We previously used a genomics approach to determine novel genes associated with this phenomenon and identified secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) as a chemosensitizer capable of reversing therapy resistance in colorectal cancer cells by enhancing apoptosis in vitro and tumor regression in vivo. Here, we examined the mechanisms by which SPARC enhances apoptosis in the presence of chemotherapy. We show that SPARC potentiates apoptosis by augmenting the signaling cascade in a caspase-8-dependent manner, because apoptosis can be abolished by caspase 8 small interfering RNA in the presence of SPARC. This occurs independently of death receptor activation and leads to downstream involvement of Bid and subsequent apoptosis. Interestingly, this results from an interaction between SPARC and the N terminus of the procaspase-8 DED-containing domain. These exciting findings provide an initial map of the apoptosis signaling events mediated by SPARC and how this can ultimately result in the reversal of chemotherapy resistance and enhanced tumor regression. This signaling cascade can be exploited therapeutically and may have potential clinical implications for patients with advanced and therapy-refractory cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2048657955,"Post-translational modification and degradation of proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system are key regulatory events in cellular responses to various stimuli. The NF-κB signaling pathway is controlled by the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Although mechanisms of ubiquitination in the NF-κB pathway have been extensively studied, deubiquitination-mediated regulation of the NF-κB signaling remains poorly understood. The present studies show that a deubiquitinating enzyme, USP11, specifically regulates IκB kinase α (IKKα) among the NF-κB signaling molecules. Knocking down USP11 attenuates expression of IKKα in the transcriptional, but not the post-translational, level. However, down-regulation of USP11 dramatically enhances NF-κB activity in response to tumor necrosis factor-α, indicating that IKKα does not require activation of NF-κB. Instead, knock down of USP11 or IKKα is associated with abrogation of p53 expression upon exposure to tumor necrosis factor-α. In concert with these results, silencing of USP11 is associated with transcriptional attenuation of the p53-responsive genes, such as p21 or Bax. Importantly, the ectopic expression of IKKα into cells silenced for USP11 restores p53 expression, demonstrating that USP11 functions as an upstream regulator of an IKKα-p53 signaling pathway.

NF-κB is an inducible transcription factor that controls the expression of a number of proteins involved in the regulation of cell survival and immune response (1Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar). NF-κB is activated by a bewildering array of stimuli, including biological agents such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), 3The abbreviations used are: TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; IκB, inhibitor of NF-κB; IKK, IκB kinase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; HA, hemagglutinin; RT, reverse transcription. interleukin-1, bacterial endotoxin, and phorbol esters and cytotoxic stimuli such as chemotherapeutic agents, ultraviolet light, oxidative stress, and ionizing radiation (2Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar, 3Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). The NF-κB signaling pathway is enzymatically controlled by ubiquitination-deubiquitination (4Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). These post-translational modifications are critical for “on-off” switch in the signaling cascade. For example, one member of IκB, designated as IκBα, is phosphorylated in response to TNFα or interleukin-1 and is thereby subjected to ubiquitination and degradation by the 26 S proteasome (5Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). The NF-κB essential modifier (NEMO, also known as IKKγ) is a key to activating IκB kinase (IKK) complex and is polyubiquitinated by TRAF6 (6Kanayama A. Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Hong M. Shaito A. Chiu Y.H. Deng L. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 535-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). In contrast, deubiquitinating mechanisms that target to ubiquitinated NF-κB signaling molecules are largely unclear. Certain insights have been derived from the finding that CYLD was identified by its association with NEMO and through systematic screening for deubiquitinating enzymes that impede NF-κB signaling (7Brummelkamp T.R. Nijman S.M. Dirac A.M. Bernards R. Nature. 2003; 424: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 8Kovalenko A. Chable-Bessia C. Cantarella G. Israel A. Wallach D. Courtois G.

Nature. 2003; 424: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Overexpression of CYLD represses NF-κB activation in response to various stimuli, including TNFα. Conversely, inactivation of CYLD by RNA interference increases inducible NF-κB activity. These findings thus suggest that CYLD acts as a negative regulator of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Little is otherwise known about direct deubiquitinating enzymes targeting to ubiquitinating molecules that are involved in NF-κB signaling. A recent study mapped a protein interaction network for TNFα/NF-κB pathway components by means of an integrated approach, including tandem affinity purification, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, network analysis, and directed functional perturbation studies using RNA interference (10Bouwmeester T. Bauch A. Ruffner H. Angrand P.O. Bergamini G. Croughton K. Cruciat C. Eberhard D. Gagneur J. Ghidelli S. Hopf C. Huhse B. Mangano R. Michon A.M. Schirle M. Schlegl J. Schwab M. Stein M.A. Bauer A.

This study identified numerous previously unknown interactors, including a deubiquitinating enzyme, USP11. However, the role for USP11 in the NF-κB signaling pathway remains obscure. Our recent studies demonstrated that IKKα, but not IKKβ, is activated and translocates into the nucleus in response to oxidative stress (11Yamaguchi T. Miki Y. Yoshida K. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 2088-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Upon exposure to oxidative stress, IKKα activation does not contribute to NF-κB activation; instead, nuclear IKKα regulates the transcription activity of the p53 tumor suppressor, indicating that the IKKα → p53 signaling pathway is associated with the cellular response to oxidative stress. In this study, we show that USP11 regulates IKKα expression in a transcriptional level. Importantly, down-regulation of IKKα does not contribute to NF-κB activation in response to TNFα. Instead, USP11-mediated regulation of IKKα functions to control p53 transcription activity. These findings support a novel mechanism in which the deubiquitinating enzyme USP11 contributes to TNFα-induced IKKα → p53 signaling pathway. Cell Culture—Human MOLT-4 and HL-60 leukemia cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with human U2OS osteosarcoma cells, and MCF-7 mammary gland carcinoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm). Cells were treated with 50 ng/ml TNFα (Pepro-Tech EC) or 5 μm MG132 (carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal; Nacalai Tesque). Plasmids—Constructs of IKKα and IKKβ are described elsewhere (12Nakano H. Shindo M. Sakon S. Nishinaka S. Mihara M. Yagita H. Okumura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

IKKγ cDNA was amplified by PCR from a human fetal brain cDNA library and cloned into the pcDNA3-FLAG vector as described elsewhere (13Yoshida K. Liu H. Miki Y. J. Biol.

An RNA interference-resistant form of USP11 was constructed by introducing silent mutations using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. The sequences of oligonucleotide primers are as follows: 5′-CATACCGATTCaATaGGgCTAGTATTGCGC-3′ and 5′-GCGCAATACTAGcCCtATtGAATCGGTATG-3′. Lowercase letters represent silent mutations.

Soluble proteins were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at 4°C. The immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer. Cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters, which were then incubated with anti-FLAG, anti-HA (Roche Applied Science), anti-USP11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-IKKα (MBL International Corp.), IKKβ (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-IKKγ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-RelA/p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-RelB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p100 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Ets-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PCNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich). The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). RT-PCR Analysis for Gene Expression—Total cellular RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). First-stand cDNA synthesis and the following PCR reactions were performed with 500 ng of total RNA using SuperScript one-step RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reaction products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel. Reporter Gene Assays—293 cells stably transfected with pNF-κB-luc and pTK-hyg (Panomics) were transfected with a variety of siRNAs followed by the treatment with TNFα. The luciferase activity was determined with a Bright-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Cells were harvested and washed with chilled phosphate-buffered saline once followed by incubation in 1% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature for chromatin cross-linking. The cells were then collected and washed with chilled phosphate-buffered saline again. After centrifugation, the cell pellets were resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A), and the lysates were sonicated to obtain DNA fragments 200–500 bp in length. After centrifugation, 50 μl of the supernatant was used as an input, and the remainder was diluted 2–2.5-fold in washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors as described above). This diluted fraction was subjected to immunoprecipitation with 2 μg of indicated antibodies for 2 h to overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The immunocomplexes were collected with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1–2 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were then pelleted by centrifugation and washed sequentially with 300 μl of the following buffers: wash buffer I (500 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), wash buffer II (250 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1% deoxycholate), and then twice with Tris-EDTA buffer. Precipitated chromatin complexes were removed from the beads by shaking with 150 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3) for 15 min, and this step was repeated. All the eluates were collected, and then the cross-linking was reversed by adding NaCl to a final concentration of 200 mm. The mixture was allowed to stand overnight at 65 °C. The remaining proteins were digested with the extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10 mm EDTA, and 40 μg/ml proteinase K) for 1 h at 45 °C. DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25/24/1) extraction and precipitated with 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes of ethanol. PCR amplification was performed in chromatin immunoprecipitated fragments using oligonucleotide pairs as described elsewhere (20Gu L. Zhu N. Findley H.W. Woods W.G. Zhou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52141-52149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously (21Yoshida K. Wang H.G. Miki Y. Kufe D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1431-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 22Yoshida K. Yamaguchi T. Shinagawa H. Taira N. Nakayama K.I. Miki Y. Mol. Cell.

Purity of the fractions was monitored by immunoblot analysis with anti-PCNA and anti-tubulin. USP11 Is Associated with IKKα Expression—Previous studies have implicated a number of deubiquitinating enzymes in several signaling cascades, including the NF-κB pathway. In particular, a recent study suggested a potential involvement of USP11 in NF-κB signaling. To determine whether USP11 affects the expression of NF-κB signalosome, U2OS cells were transfected with a scramble siRNA or a siRNA that targets USP11. We examined the expression of seven gene products that are directly involved in the NF-κB signaling pathway (Fig. 1A). Among these products, the expression of IKKα was significantly reduced in cells silenced for USP11. To exclude the possibility that knocking down USP11 is associated with off-target effects, siRNAs that target different USP11 sequences (USP11 siRNA-a and siRNA-b) were transfected into U2OS cells. Transfection of USP11 siRNA-a or siRNA-b resulted in similar levels of attenuated IKKα expression, indicating that USP11 specifically down-regulates IKKα expression (see Fig. 4A). To confirm the regulation of IKKα expression by USP11, U2OS cells were transfected with the USP11 siRNA followed by the transfection of the FLAG-USP11 mutant that is resistant for the USP11 siRNA by introducing silent mutations. The results demonstrated that IKKα expression was restored by forced expression of USP11 into U2OS cells silenced for USP11 (Fig. 1B). To investigate whether suppression of IKKα by USP11 silencing is regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, FLAG-tagged IKK families were transfected into U2OS cells together with HA-tagged ubiquitin. Previous studies demonstrated that IKKγ is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (4Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). In concert with these results, overexpression of IKKγ was sufficient for substantial ubiquitination, regardless of TNFα treatment (Fig. 1C). By contrast, there was little if any ubiquitination on IKKα or IKKβ, indicating that IKKα and IKKβ function independently of ubiquitination-mediated regulation. These results thus suggest that USP11 regulates IKKα by a ubiquitin-independent manner. Another possibility is that regulation of IKKα by USP11 is mediated by undefined molecules that are controlled by the ubiquitin-deubiquitin mechanism. To further define USP11-mediated regulation of NF-κB signalosome, total RNA from U2OS cells in the presence or absence of USP11 was subjected to RT-PCR analysis. Knock down of USP11 specifically attenuated IKKα expression, suggesting that regulation of IKKα by USP11 occurs at the transcriptional level (Fig. 2A). In this context, a previous study showed that IKKα is positively regulated by a transcription factor, Ets-1 (20Gu L. Zhu N. Findley H.W. Woods W.G. Zhou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52141-52149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, it is plausible that USP11 affects Ets-1 by the ubiquitin-deubiquitin mechanism to control IKKα expression. To examine this possibility, U2OS cells were transfected with the scramble siRNA or USP11 siRNA followed by treatment with or without TNFα. The expression level of Ets-1 remained unchanged even in USP11-silencd cells, clearly indicating that Ets-1 is not targeted by USP11, at least post-translational level (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 4USP11 controls IKKα → p53 signaling in response to TNFα.

As reported previously (20Gu L. Zhu N. Findley H.W. Woods W.G. Zhou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52141-52149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), Ets-1 occupied IKKα promoter, and this occupancy was increased after TNFα stimulation in U2OS cells (Fig. 2C). Importantly, the finding that Ets-1 occupancy on the IKKα promoter in cells silenced for USP11 was comparable with that in control cells indicates that Ets-1 transcriptional activity is regulated in an USP11-independent matter (Fig. 2C). Similar results were obtained in MCF-7 cells (data not shown). Taken together, these findings support an essential role for USP11 in the regulation of IKKα expression at a transcriptional level. Knocking Down USP11 Enhances TNFα-induced NF-κB Activation—To assess the effects of USP11 on the activity of NF-κB, 293 cells stably transfected with the luciferase-reporter vector containing NF-κB response elements were silenced for USP11 or RelA/p65. As shown previously, silencing of RelA/p65 was associated with pronounced inhibition of NF-κB activity in response to TNFα (Fig. 3A). By contrast, knocking down USP11 enhanced TNFα-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 3B). To further define the involvement of USP11 in NF-κB activation, U2OS cells were transfected with the scramble siRNA or USP11 siRNA followed by TNFα treatment. Immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates demonstrated substantial attenuation of resynthesized IκBα in the absence of USP11 (Fig. 3B). In accordance with this result, immunoblotting of nuclear lysates with anti-RelA/p65 revealed that at 2 h after TNFα treatment, 73% of nuclear RelA/p65 was exported from the nucleus in cells transfected with the scramble siRNA (Fig. 3B). In contrast, 83% of RelA/p65 remained in the nucleus in cells silenced for USP11 at the same time point (Fig. 3B), indicating that nuclear export of RelA/p65 was abrogated in cells silenced for USP11 (Fig. 3B). These findings provide a potential model in which, in USP11-silencing cells, RelA/p65 remains in the nucleus because of attenuation of resynthesized IκBα, resulting in sustained activation of NF-κB. In addition, given the data from reporter assays that imply enhancement of NF-κB activity in the absence of USP11, the confirmed results that IKKα expression is down-regulated by silencing USP11 further suggested that NF-κB activation occurs independently of IKKα under our experimental conditions (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these findings indicate that USP11 negatively regulates NF-κB activity in response to TNFα by a yet undefined mechanism. USP11 Controls the IKKα → p53 Signaling in Response to TNFα—Our recent study showed that the protein kinase C δ → IKKα signaling pathway stabilizes and activates p53 in response to oxidative stress (11Yamaguchi T. Miki Y. Yoshida K. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 2088-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These finding led us to examine whether USP11 controls p53 through IKKα upon exposure to TNFα. As shown previously, knocking down USP11 in U2OS cells was associated with attenuation of IKKα expression (Fig. 4A). More importantly, steady-state levels of p53 expression were also down-regulated in the absence of USP11 (Fig. 4A). Although U2OS cells express p53 at low but detectable levels (13Yoshida K. Liu H. Miki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5734-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), p53 expression is little if any in unstressed MCF-7 cells. In this regard, we examined the effect of TNFα on p53 expression by MCF-7 cells. In concert with accumulating studies (24Ladiwala U. Li H. Antel J.P. Nalbantoglu J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Gotlieb W.H. Watson J.M. Rezai A. Johnson M. Martinez-Maza O. Berek J.S. Am. J. Obstet.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18367-18373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), p53 was stabilized after treatment of cells with TNFα for 8 h, and its expression was sustained at least 24 h following TNFα treatment (Fig. 4B). In these experimental conditions, TNFα-induced p53 expression was completely abrogated in cells silenced for USP11 (Fig. 4C). In concert with this result, mRNA expression of p53-responsive genes, such as Bax and p21, were also attenuated in the absence of USP11 (Fig. 4C). By contrast, mRNA of p53 was constant regardless of USP11 expression, suggesting that USP11 regulates p53 via a post-translational, not a transcriptional, mechanism (Fig. 4C). To further define whether regulation of p53 by USP11 is associated with ubiquitin-proteasome system, MCF-7 cells transfected with scramble siRNA or USP11 siRNA were pretreated with proteasome inhibitor, MG132, followed by treatment with TNFα. Immunoblot analysis with anti-p53 revealed that, even in MG132-treated cells, knocking down USP11 reduced the expression levels of p53, suggesting that regulation of p53 by USP11 occurs independently of ubiquitin-proteasome proteolysis (Fig. 4D). To determine whether USP11 regulation of p53 involves IKKα, MCF-7 cells were transfected with scramble siRNA, USP11 siRNA, or IKKα siRNA and then treated with or without TNFα. The results demonstrated that p53 expression was substantially attenuated in USP11- or IKKα-deficient cells (Fig. 4E). Importantly, the ectopic expression of IKKα in USP11-silenced cells restored p53 expression (Fig. 4E), suggesting the possibility that effect of USP11 on p53 expression is regulated exclusively through IKKα. In this regard, recent studies have demonstrated that IKKα specifically translocates into the nucleus and phosphorylates histone H3 (28Anest V. Hanson J.L. Cogswell P.C. Steinbrecher K.A. Strahl B.D. Baldwin A.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 29Yamamoto Y. Verma U.N. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.T. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Moreover, IKKα forms a complex with transcription coactivators such as AIB1/SRC-3 to modulate gene expression (30Park K.J. Krishnan V. O'Malley B.W. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 71-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Other studies have suggested that IKKα is recruited to the chromatin to derepress the silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) (31Hoberg J.E. Popko A.E. Ramsey C.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 457-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 32Hoberg J.E. Yeung F. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 245-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings indicate a pivotal role for nuclear IKKα as a regulator of transcription factors in response to TNFα. Given the previous finding that IKKα also stabilizes p53 by Ser-20 phosphorylation (11Yamaguchi T. Miki Y. Yoshida K. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 2088-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), these results thus support a mechanism by which USP11 regulates the expression of IKKα, which in turn controls p53 in response to TNFα. Regulation of IKKα → p53 Signaling Pathway by USP11—Previous work showed that protein kinase C δ activates IKKα in response to oxidative stress (11Yamaguchi T. Miki Y. Yoshida K. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 2088-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Such activation was associated with increased p53 expression, indicating that the protein kinase C δ → IKKα signaling pathway functions as a positive regulator of p53. In this context, it should be clarified whether the protein kinase C δ → IKKα signaling is also involved in TNFα-induced p53 expression. Nevertheless, the present study identified another regulator of IKKα, USP11. Interestingly, despite the fact that USP11 is a deubiquitinating enzyme, USP11 regulation of IKKα was independent of ubiquitin-deubiquitin status. Instead, USP11 controlled IKKα at the transcriptional level by unknown mechanism. Importantly, USP11 also controlled the stabilization and activation of p53 through IKKα regulation at a steady-state level and in response to TNFα. In this regard, there is indeed another possibility that USP11 directly deubiquitinates p53 to stabilize its expression. However, other work demonstrated that overexpression of USP11 has no obvious effect on the levels of p53 ubiquitination or stabilization of p53 (33Li M. Chen D. Shiloh A. Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Qin J. Gu W. Nature. 2002; 416: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). The present findings that ectopic expression of IKKα in USP11-depleted MCF-7 cells markedly increased p53 expression also support an indirect role for USP11 in the regulation of p53. Although the precise mechanism by which IKKα controls p53 remains unclear, available evidence indicated that IKKα phosphorylates p53 for its stabilization and activation in response to oxidative stress. In this context, activation of p53 by TNFα may be, at least in part, involved in IKKα-mediated phosphorylation. A recent study has demonstrated that p53 expression in IKKα–/– knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblast is comparable with that in wild type mouse embryonic fibroblast (34Huang W.C. Ju T.K. Hung M.C. Chen C.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 75-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The result also demonstrated that p53 expression was substantially high even in the steady-state level, and no increase was observed after TNFα exposure. In this regard, given the present study demonstrating that p53 expression was attenuated in human cancer cells silenced for IKKα (Fig. 4E), there is indeed an apparent discrepancy to be solved in the future work. However, regulation of expression for human p53 is considerably different from that for mouse p53 (35Toledo F. Wahl G.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 909-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that human IKKα is specifically associated with the regulation of human p53 expression. Obviously, further studies are needed to clarify this issue. In summary, the present studies demonstrate that USP11 controls IKKα by a deubiquitination-independent mechanism. Regulation of IKKα by USP11 is associated with p53 stabilization and activation upon exposure to TNFα (Fig. 5). These findings indicate that USP11 controls the IKKα → p53 signaling pathway in response to TNFα.

They act as innate immune sensors by recognizing conserved molecular markers exposed on microbial surfaces and thereby triggering effector mechanisms such as enhanced phagocytosis and inflammation. In humans, L- and H-ficolins have been characterized in plasma, whereas a third species, M-ficolin, is secreted by monocytes and macrophages. To decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying their recognition properties, we previously solved the structures of the recognition domains of L- and H-ficolins, in complex with various model ligands (Garlatti, V., Belloy, N., Martin, L., Lacroix, M., Matsushita, M., Endo, Y., Fujita, T., Fontecilla-Camps, J.

This study also reveals the structural determinants for binding to sialylated compounds, a property restricted to human M-ficolin and its mouse counterpart, ficolin B.

Belloy N. Martin L. Lacroix M. Matsushita M. Endo Y. Fujita T. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. Gaboriaud C. EMBO J. 2007; 24: 623-633Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Recombinant M-ficolin shows a marked preference for acetylated compounds, as also observed for L-ficolin (15Frederiksen P.D. Thiel S. Larsen C.B. Jensenius J.C. Scand. J. Immunol. 2005; 62: 462-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and binds neoglycoproteins bearing GlcNAc, GalNAc, and sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine (16Liu Y. Endo Y. Iwaki D. Nakata M. Matsushita M. Wada I. Inoue K. Munakata M. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3150-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Binding to the smooth type LT2 strain of Salmonella typhimurium and to Streptococcus aureus has been reported, but only binding to the latter could be inhibited by GlcNAc (17Teh C. Le Y. Lee S.H. Lu J. Immunology. 2000; 101: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The structure of the recognition domain of human M-ficolin was recently reported, but this turned out to be in a conformation devoid of ligand binding activity (18Tanio M. Kondo S. Sugio S. Kohno T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3889-3895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Here we report five novel x-ray structures of this domain, namely a ligand-free and three ligand-bound structures obtained at pH 7.0 plus an inactive form obtained at pH 5.6. For the first time, these provide the structural basis for the recognition function of M-ficolin and reveal how it is subject to a pH-dependent conformational switch. Recombinant Protein Production and Purification—The DNA segment encoding the C-terminal residues 80–297 of mature human M-ficolin was amplified using VentR polymerase and the pMT/Bip/V5-HisA plasmid containing the full-length cDNA (16Liu Y. Endo Y. Iwaki D. Nakata M. Matsushita M. Wada I. Inoue K. Munakata M. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3150-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) as a template, according to established procedures. This segment starts at the first residue following the collagen-like sequence. The DNA was cloned in frame with the melittin signal peptide of the pNT-Bac baculovirus transfer vector (19Rossi V. Bally I. Thielens N.M. Esser A.F. Arlaud G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1232-1239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and the recombinant baculovirus was generated using the Bac-to-Bac™ system (Invitrogen Corp.) and amplified as described previously (20Thielens N.M. Cseh S. Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T. Rossi V. Jensenius J.C. Arlaud G.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5068-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). High Five cells were infected with the recombinant virus for 96 h at 27 °C. The protein was purified from culture supernatants by ion exchange chromatography on a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 50 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.6, using a linear gradient to 250 mm NaCl. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed using the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization technique under conditions described previously (21Teillet F. Dublet B. Andrieu J.P. Gaboriaud C. Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2870-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Crystallization, Structure Determination, and Refinement—The protein was concentrated to 6 mg/ml in 145 mm NaCl, 50 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.6. Several crystallization hits were obtained using the high throughput crystallization facility at EMBL, Grenoble. Crystals were reproducibly obtained at 20 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing equal volumes of the protein solution and of a reservoir solution composed either of 11% polyethylene glycol 4000, 5% isopropyl alcohol, 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.0, or of 23% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.32 m lithium sulfate, 0.1 m Mes, pH 5.6. M-ficolin-ligand complexes were obtained by soaking crystals obtained at pH 7.0 in a cryoprotecting solution composed of 11–14% polyethylene glycol 4000, 15% polyethylene glycol 400, 0.1 m Hepes, and 500 mm ligand (GlcNAc, GalNAc, or Neu5Ac) just before flash-cooling the crystal in liquid nitrogen. Data collection was performed at different ESRF beamlines (ID23eh2, ID14eh4, or ID14eh2), as stated in Table 1. Diffraction data were processed using either MOSFLM from CCP4 (22Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19762) Google Scholar) or XDS (23Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3230) Google Scholar). Complete crystallographic data statistics are provided in Table 1. The two ligand-free M-ficolin structures obtained at pH 7.0 and 5.6 were solved by molecular replacement, using the L-ficolin structure (Protein Data Bank code 2j1g) as a search model. Model rebuilding was performed using the graphic program Coot (24Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23349) Google Scholar). Refinements were carried out with Refmac5 (25Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 247-255Crossref Scopus (13865) Google Scholar). The quality of the map allowed construction of all but the first N-terminal residue of the recombinant fragment at pH 7.0. The N-terminal extremity of M-ficolin exhibits various conformations depending on crystal environment. In the structure obtained at pH 5.6, the segment 278–285 looks disordered in each molecule.

As assessed by mass spectrometry, a single species with a mass of 24,549 ± 12 Da was purified, accounting for the unmodified polypeptide chain (calculated value 24,553 Da). Selection of the best diffracting crystals among several crystallization hits obtained at two different pH values allowed us to solve to the five x-ray structures presented here (Table 2). The Ligand-free and Ligand-bound Structures Solved at Neutral pH—The ligand-free structure obtained at pH 7.0 was solved by molecular replacement using L-ficolin (13Garlatti V. Belloy N. Martin L. Lacroix M. Matsushita M. Endo Y. Fujita T. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. Gaboriaud C. EMBO J. 2007; 24: 623-633Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar) as a starting model and refined to 1.5 Å resolution (Table 2). The protein is homotrimeric, with crystallographic 3-fold symmetry (Fig. 1A). As expected from the amino acid sequence conservation of the interprotomer interfaces in ficolins, this assembly is very similar to those previously described for the L- and H-ficolin recognition domains (13Garlatti V. Belloy N. Martin L. Lacroix M. Matsushita M. Endo Y. Fujita T. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. Gaboriaud C. EMBO J. 2007; 24: 623-633Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Likewise, homologous Ca2+ binding sites are found in the most external part of the trimer, with a distance of 65 Å between the Ca2+ ions, as observed in L-ficolin (Fig. 1, A and D). Ca2+ coordination in M-ficolin involves two water molecules, both carboxylate oxygens of Asp233, one of the side-chain oxygens of Asp235, and the main-chain carbonyl oxygens of Ser237 and Ser239. M-ficolin and L-ficolin have highly similar overall protomer structures, with an r.m.s. deviation value of 0.5 Å for 211 superposed Cα atoms (Fig. 1B). Only minor structural differences are observed (e.g. for the free N-terminal end and at position 170). A major functionally relevant feature of the structure is the cis-conformation of the Asp253–Cys254 peptide bond, already observed in H- and L-ficolins (Fig. 1C), as well as in the homologous invertebrate lectin TL5A (14Kairies N. Beisel H.G. Fuentes-Prior P. Tsuda R. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Bode W. Huber R. Kawabata S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13519-13524Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This is in sharp contrast with the trans-conformation seen in the M-ficolin structure recently reported by Tanio et al. (18Tanio M. Kondo S. Sugio S. Kohno T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3889-3895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), which is devoid of ligand binding activity. In order to gain structural insights into the binding specificity of M-ficolin, the crystals obtained at neutral pH were soaked into ligand-containing solutions. Three different structures of M-ficolin in complex with GlcNAc, GalNAc, and Neu5Ac were thus solved and refined up to 1.75 Å resolution (Table 2). Each of these three ligands was bound to the S1 site, in the vicinity of the Ca2+ binding site. These two sites are located in the P domain (residues 218–288), which forms the external part of the homotrimeric structure (Fig. 1). The ligand-free and ligand-bound structures obtained at neutral pH are very similar, with a mean overall r.m.s. deviation of 0.2 ± 0.03 Å. This novel M-ficolin structural conformation, endowed with ligand recognition ability, will be referred to as the “binding state.” An Evolutionarily Conserved N-Acetyl-binding Pocket—The detailed interactions of the three ligands with site S1 observed at pH 7.0 are depicted in Fig. 2 (A–C). A common set of three different interactions stabilizes the ligand acetamido group: (i) its methyl group is in Van der Waals contacts with the surrounding hydrophobic pocket formed by Phe245, His255, Tyr271, Ala272, and Tyr283; (ii) its carbonyl oxygen is hydrogen-bonded to the backbone NH group of Cys254 and His255; (iii) its nitrogen atom is hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl group of Tyr271. This latter interaction is mediated by a water molecule in the case of GlcNAc, whereas the Tyr271 side chain slightly moves toward the ligand to provide a direct hydrogen bond in the case of GalNAc and Neu5Ac. Tyr271 is thus the only flexible component of the binding site (Fig. 2D). As illustrated in Fig. 2E, S1 is highly homologous to the GlcNAc binding site of the distantly related invertebrate lectin TL5A (14Kairies N. Beisel H.G. Fuentes-Prior P. Tsuda R. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Bode W. Huber R. Kawabata S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13519-13524Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Both the hydrophobic pocket and the unusual cis-conformation of the Asp253-Cys254 peptide bond (Arg218-Cys219 in TL5A) are conserved, the latter being essential to correctly position the two consecutive backbone NH groups for appropriate interaction with the acetamido oxygen. These characteristics are also highly conserved in mammalian ficolins, except for a slightly different hydrophobic pocket in human H-ficolin (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, the replacement of Tyr271 by a phenylalanine in L-ficolin (Fig. 2F) could explain the lack of binding of N-acetylated ligands in its S1 site, where an acetate molecule is often bound instead (13Garlatti V. Belloy N. Martin L. Lacroix M. Matsushita M. Endo Y. Fujita T. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. Gaboriaud C. EMBO J. 2007; 24: 623-633Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Recognition of the three N-acetylated carbohydrates by M-ficolin also involves additional hydrogen-bonding interactions with their sugar rings, but those supplemental interactions depend on the nature of the ligand. In the case of GlcNAc, the 1-OH oxygen is hydrogen-bonded to the backbone carbonyl group of His255 (Fig. 2B). This differs from the recognition of GlcNAc by TL5A, where the 1-OH oxygen forms hydrogen bonds with the guanidinium nitrogen of Arg186 and with the hydroxyl group of Tyr248 (Fig. 1E). More distant polar interactions are observed in the case of GalNAc, with a water-mediated hydrogen bond between 4-OH and the backbone oxygen of Asp253 and a direct interaction between 1-OH and the hydroxyl group of Tyr283 (Fig. 2A). Structural Basis of Sialic Acid Recognition—The structure of the M-ficolin-Neu5Ac complex reveals a more extensive network of polar interactions required to recognize this bulkier molecule (Fig. 2C). The neuraminic group is hydrogen-bonded through the 8-OH oxygen to the hydroxyl group of Tyr283 (Fig. 2C). Further stabilization is achieved by direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds between the 7-OH oxygen and the backbone oxygen and nitrogen of Asp253, respectively. Interestingly, as illustrated by the superposition of the M- and L-ficolin structures (Fig. 2F), steric hindrance may explain why most ficolins do not interact with sialic acids. Indeed, two small residues in the vicinity of the S1 site, Gly221 and Ala256 in M-ficolin, are replaced in L-ficolin by the bulkier residues, phenylalanine and threonine, respectively. These two residues reduce the size of the binding pocket, thereby limiting its access to large carbohydrate molecules such as NeuNAc (Fig. 2F). Sequence alignments of mammalian ficolins show that, except for mouse ficolin B and human M-ficolin, both positions are occupied by bulkier residues (Fig. 1D). The S1 Binding Site Is Disrupted and Exhibits Increased Flexibility at Acidic pH—It was recently reported that the GlcNAc binding activity of M-ficolin is pH-sensitive, and the structure of its recognition domain, obtained at pH 5.6, was found to exhibit inactive loop conformations around the S1 binding site (18Tanio M. Kondo S. Sugio S. Kohno T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3889-3895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Such differences might have been either a direct consequence of the acidic pH of the crystallization solution or a possible artifact linked to the introduction of a 23-residue-long C-terminal tag in the recombinant domain (26Tanio M. Kondo S. Sugio S. Kohno T. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Commun. 2006; 62: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To investigate this question, our own construct, corresponding solely to the fibrinogen-like recognition domain of M-ficolin, was crystallized at pH 5.6, and its structure was solved and refined to a resolution of 1.7 Å (Table 2). Although this new crystal form differs from the one reported previously (18Tanio M. Kondo S. Sugio S. Kohno T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3889-3895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the resulting structure is similar (mean subunit r.m.s. deviation value of 0.7 Å), with some differences mostly arising from changes in the ligand-binding region, as illustrated in Fig. 3B. This additional M-ficolin structure also clearly shows the Asp253-Cys254 peptide bond in a trans-conformation, which drastically modifies the positioning of the His255 side chain (Fig. 3B). In addition to this cis-trans conformational change, the acidic pH induces large displacements (>10 Å) of Tyr271 and Tyr283, both essential for ligand binding (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, with the exception of Phe245, all residues making up S1 are extensively displaced at acidic pH, resulting in a conformation clearly inappropriate for ligand binding. This acidic conformation is significantly different from the structures obtained at neutral pH, with a mean subunit r.m.s. deviation of 2.14 ± 0.45 Å, a value that increases significantly to 3.36 ± 0.64 Å when only the ligand-binding region is considered. This acidic conformation will be therefore referred to as the “nonbinding” state. The conformational transition from the binding to the nonbinding state involves the concerted displacement of four surface segments or loops, namely L1 (218–224), L2 (253–258), L3 (264–274), and L4 (278–288). Except Phe245, all of the residues defining S1 are included in loops L2–L4, and L1 includes Gly221, which, as stated above, is probably the key determinant for the specificity toward sialic acid. The increased flexibility of these four loops at acidic pH was assessed by analyzing both the gaps in the crystallographic models, which correspond to disordered segments (Table 3), and the mean B factor in these loops according to the experimental context (Tables 4 and 5).TABLE 3Gaps corresponding to disordered segments in the structures determined at pH 5.6GapProtein Data Bank codeSubunitLoop277–2882JHHaPresent studyCL4277–2862JHHaPresent studyFL4262–268bResidue numbering corresponding to the present study2D39cTanio et al.

https://openalex.org/W2021571501,"We have earlier shown that α-methylated spermidine and spermine analogues rescue cells from polyamine depletion-induced growth inhibition and maintain pancreatic integrity under severe polyamine deprivation. However, because α-methylspermidine can serve as a precursor of hypusine, an integral part of functional eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A required for cell proliferation, and because α, ω-bismethylspermine can be converted to methylspermidine, it is not entirely clear whether the restoration of cell growth is actually attributable to hypusine formed from these polyamine analogues. Here, we have used optically active isomers of methylated spermidine and spermine and show that polyamine depletion-induced acute cytostasis in cultured cells could be reversed by all the isomers of the methylpolyamines irrespective of whether they served or not as precursors of hypusine. In transgenic rats with activated polyamine catabolism, all the isomers similarly restored liver regeneration and reduced plasma α-amylase activity associated with induced pancreatitis. Under the above experimental conditions, the (S, S)- but not the (R, R)-isomer of bismethylspermine was converted to methylspermidine apparently through the action of spermine oxidase strongly preferring the (S, S)-isomer. Of the analogues, however, only (S)-methylspermidine sustained cell growth during prolonged (more than 1 week) inhibition of polyamine biosynthesis. It was also the only isomer efficiently converted to hypusine, indicating that deoxyhypusine synthase likewise possesses hidden stereospecificity. Taken together, the results show that growth inhibition in response to polyamine depletion involves two phases, an acute and a late hypusine-dependent phase.

A large number of studies have indicated that a continuous supply of the polyamines (spermidine and spermine) is required for animal cell proliferation to occur as polyamine depletion resulted either from a specific inhibition of their biosynthesis (1Thomas T. Thomas T.J. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2003; 7: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) or from an activation of their catabolism (2Jänne J. Alhonen L. Pietilä M. Keinänen T.A. Uimari A. Hyvönen M.T. Pirinen E. Järvinen A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2006; 139: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) invariably leads to growth inhibition. The molecular mechanisms involved in the requirement of polyamines for animal cell growth are largely unknown besides the fact that spermidine, but not spermine, serves as the sole biosynthetic precursor for hypusine, an unusual amino acid that is an integral component of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) 4The abbreviations used are: eIF5A, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A; DFMO, 2-difluoromethylornithine; MeSpd, α-methylspermidine; Me2Spm, α, ω-bismethylspermine; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; SMO, spermine oxidase; SSAT, spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase; AbeAdo, 5′-([(Z)-4-amino-2-butenyl]methylamino)-5′-deoxyadenosine (MDL 73811). (3Park M.H. Cooper H.L. Folk J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2869-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Because functional (hypusinated) eIF5A is required for animal cell growth (4Park M.H. Wolff E.C. Lee Y.B. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27827-27832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Park M.H. Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 475-479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), it is often difficult to judge whether spermidine depletion-induced growth inhibition is secondary to hypusine deprivation. The finding that cytostasis resulting from an inhibition of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase in cultured cells is reversed by α-methylspermidine (MeSpd) but not by α, ω-bismethylspermine (Me2Spm) indicates that growth inhibition was attributable to hypusine depletion as MeSpd, but not Me2Spm, can serve as the biosynthetic precursor for hypusine formation (6Byers T.L. Lakanen J.R. Coward J.K. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). On the other hand, MeSpd and both singly and doubly methylated spermine derivatives appear to reverse growth inhibition by 2-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, in cultured cells (6Byers T.L. Lakanen J.R. Coward J.K. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 7Järvinen A. Grigorenko N. Khomutov A.R. Hyvönen M.T. Uimari A. Vepsäläinen J.

In support of the notion that spermidine and spermine are exchangeable in maintaining cell growth, we found that Me2Spm, as effectively as MeSpd, reversed DFMO-induced cytostasis in cultured cells under conditions where the oxidation of spermine was totally blocked (7Järvinen A. Grigorenko N. Khomutov A.R. Hyvönen M.T. Uimari A. Vepsäläinen J. Sinervirta R. Keinänen T.A. Vujcic S. Alhonen L. Porter C.W. Jänne J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6595-6601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, we obtained evidence indicating that Me2Spm can overcome the proliferative block of early liver regeneration and prevent the development of polyamine depletion-induced acute pancreatitis in transgenic rats overexpressing spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) (7Järvinen A. Grigorenko N. Khomutov A.R. Hyvönen M.T. Uimari A. Vepsäläinen J. Sinervirta R. Keinänen T.A. Vujcic S. Alhonen L. Porter C.W. Jänne J. J. Biol.

However, because racemic Me2Spm is converted to MeSpd, at least in some cell types (like hepatocytes) (7Järvinen A. Grigorenko N. Khomutov A.R. Hyvönen M.T. Uimari A. Vepsäläinen J. Sinervirta R.

Chem. 2005; 280: 6595-6601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether the growth inhibition is actually due to hypusine depletion. We have now synthesized and used pure stereoisomers of MeSpd and especially of Me2Spm as surrogates for the natural polyamines under experimental conditions where the pools of spermidine and/or spermine were profoundly depleted. The application of these analogues allowed the discrimination of hypusine-independent and hypusine-dependent phases of polyamine depletion-induced cytostasis. Hence, the optical isomers of α-methylated polyamines turned out to be useful tools to investigate cellular effects of spermidine and spermine. Chemicals—The synthesis of optically active (R)- and (S)-isomers of MeSpd and all stereoisomers (R,R, S,S, and R,S) of Me2Spm has been described recently (9Grigorenko N.A. Khomutov A.R. Keinänen T.A. Järvinen A. Alhonen L. Jänne J. Vepsäläinen J. Tetrahedron. 2007; 63: 2257-2263Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The α-methylated polyamine analogues and their isomers showed purity greater than 99.5% according to 1H/13C NMR data and high performance liquid chromatography analysis. [methyl-3H]Thymidine (specific radioactivity 71.2 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [14C]Spm (110 mCi/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences. Animals and Cell Cultures—The generation of transgenic rats harboring mouse metallothionein I promoter-driven SSAT transgene has been described earlier (10Alhonen L. Parkkinen J.J. Keinänen T. Sinervirta R. Herzig K.H. Jänne J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8290-8295Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Partial hepatectomy of the rats was performed according to the original method of Higgins and Anderson (11Higgins G.H. Anderson R.M. Arch. Pathol. 1931; 12: 186-202Google Scholar). Acute pancreatitis in the SSAT transgenic rats was induced with zinc as described in Alhonen et al. (10Alhonen L. Parkkinen J.J. Keinänen T. Sinervirta R. Herzig K.H. Jänne J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8290-8295Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Kuopio and the provincial government. The prostate carcinoma cell lines, DU145 and LNCaP, were obtained from ATCC. The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamycin under conditions of +37 °C and 10% CO2. To determine the ability of the stereoisomers of MeSpd and Me2Spm to reverse DFMO-induced growth inhibition, the cells were plated (1 × 106 cells/10 cm plate) and incubated overnight, after which the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing DFMO (5 mm) and polyamine analogue (100 μm). The cells were then harvested by trypsinization, electronically counted (Coulter Counter model Z1), and passaged (2 × 106 cells/10-cm plate) every 3 days until day 12. The content of DFMO and analogues was maintained with each passage. Analytical Methods—Ornithine decarboxylase (12Jänne J. Williams-Ashman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1725-1732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and SSAT (13Bernacki R.J. Oberman E.J. Seweryniak K.E. Atwood A. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 847-857PubMed Google Scholar) activities were assayed according to published methods. High performance liquid chromatography was used to determine the natural polyamines and their methylated derivatives essentially as described earlier (14Hyvönen T. Keinänen T.A. Khomutov A.R. Khomutov R.M. Eloranta T.O. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 574: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical analysis of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was carried out as described earlier (15Alhonen L. Räsänen T.L. Sinervirta R. Parkkinen J.J. Korhonen V.P. Pietilä M. Jänne J. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). eIF5A was measured by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting as previously described (16Taylor C.A. Sun Z.

Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The antibody against eIF5A was purchased from BD Biosciences. The gels were blotted onto an Immobilon FL membrane (Millipore). The membranes were scanned with a Typhoon Variable Mode Imager (GE Healthcare). Lysates from cells treated with 400 μml-mimosine (an inhibitor of deoxyhypusine hydroxylase) or 50 μm GC7 (N1-guanyl-1,7-diaminoheptane, an inhibitor of deoxyhypusine synthase) for 24 h were used as references. α-Amylase activity was measured from rat plasma using Microlab 200 (Merck) analyzer and Ecoline S+ reagent based on CNP-G3 method (DiaSys Diagnostic Systems GmbH). Enzyme Kinetic Analyses with Human Recombinant SMO—Human recombinant SMO was prepared as described earlier (7Järvinen A. Grigorenko N. Khomutov A.R. Hyvönen M.T. Uimari A. Vepsäläinen J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 6595-6601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) except omitting the affinity purification step with polyamine-conjugated Sepharose. The kinetic studies were carried out twice with triplicates at five different (5–100 μm) substrate concentrations in 100 mm glycine-NaOH at pH 9.5 containing 5 mm dithiothreitol. Enzyme stock solution was diluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.1% Triton-X-100 before kinetic studies to yield 0.1–4.0 μg/10 μl of SMO for each reaction mixture. Reactions were carried out and analyzed as described earlier (7Järvinen A. Grigorenko N. Khomutov A.R. Hyvönen M.T. Uimari A. Vepsäläinen J. Sinervirta R. Keinänen T.A. Vujcic S. Alhonen L. Porter C.W. Jänne J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6595-6601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). SMO Activity Assay—The reaction mixture (180 μl) contained 100 mm glycine-NaOH (pH 9.5), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm pargyline, 1.0 mm semicarbazide, cell lysate (100 μg of total protein), and 250 μm [14C]spermine (30 mCi/mmol). The reaction mixture, without [14C]spermine, was preincubated at +37 °C for 10 min, and further incubation with [14C]spermine was performed for 1 h. The reaction was terminated with 20 μl of 50% sulfosalicylic acid containing 100 μm diaminoheptane and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. Polyamines were separated using high performance liquid chromatography, fractions were collected at 1-min intervals, and radioactivity of each fraction was measured using liquid scintillation counter. The blank (without cell lysate) and the reaction mixture containing 100 μm MDL 72527 (polyamine oxidase/SMO inhibitor) were used as controls for determining background activity and specificity of reaction. Statistical Analyses—The data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. One-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's or Bonferroni's post hoc tests was used for multiple comparisons with the aid of a software package, GraphPad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). The same software package was used for the analyses of enzyme kinetic data using Michaelis-Menten equation with nonlinear fitting. The Methylated Polyamine Derivatives Rescue Cells from Difluoromethylornithine-induced Growth Inhibition—As depicted in Fig. 1, A and B, all the stereoisomers of MeSpd and Me2Spm equally effectively rescued DU145 prostate carcinoma cells from DFMO-induced growth inhibition. Similarly, all the isomers of Me2Spm reversed the cytostasis caused by the drug in LNCaP cells with little differences between individual isomers (Fig. 1C). However, as indicated in the insets (panels B and C), an interesting difference existed between the Me2Spm stereoisomers, as only the (S,S)-isomer, but not the (R,R) isomer, appeared to be converted to MeSpd in both cell types. Restoration of Early Liver Regeneration in Transgenic Rats with Activated Polyamine Catabolism by the Analogues—Partial hepatectomy of transgenic rats overexpressing SSAT under the metallothionein promoter leads to delayed liver regeneration due to striking induction of the transgene in response to the operation (15Alhonen L. Räsänen T.L. Sinervirta R. Parkkinen J.J. Korhonen V.P. Pietilä M. Jänne J. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The failure to initiate regeneration is in all likelihood attributable to the profoundly reduced hepatic spermidine and spermine pools as the regeneration can be restored in the transgenic animals by a prior administration of MeSpd or Me2Spm (7Järvinen A. Grigorenko N. Khomutov A.R. Hyvönen M.T. Uimari A. Vepsäläinen J. Sinervirta R. Keinänen T.A. Vujcic S. Alhonen L. Porter C.W. Jänne J. J. Biol.

Fig. 2 depicts the results of an experiment where racemic MeSpd and (R,R)- and (S,S)-isomers of Me2Spm were tested for their capacity to restore liver regeneration in the transgenic animals. As indicated in the figure, partial hepatectomy resulted in a marked enhancement of thymidine incorporation in the livers of wild-type animals at 24 h after the operation, whereas in the transgenic animals it remained at the low preoperative level. Racemic MeSpd and the (R,R)- and (S,S)-isomers of Me2Spm given before the operation fully restored DNA synthesis in the transgenic animals (Fig. 2A). As in the case of the prostate cancer cell lines, only the (S,S)-isomer of Me2Spm was converted to MeSpd in the liver (Table 1).TABLE 1Effect of racemic MeSpd and (S,S)- and (R,R)-isomers of Me2Spm on the hepatic polyamine levels at 24 h after partial hepatectomy of wild-type and MT-SSAT transgenic ratsGenotype and treatmentPutrescineSpermidineSpermineN1-Ac-spermidineMeSpdMe2Spmpmol/mg tissueWild typeND1066 ± 160910 ± 90168 ± 196Wild type, reg.<51695 ± 196747 ± 71117 ± 6Tg782 ± 134844 ± 84155 ± 22127 ± 32Tg, reg.2758 ± 1028366 ± 21552 ± 1495 ± 29Tg, MeSpd+reg.2142 ± 326367 ± 6635 ± 8121 ± 231048 ± 164NDTg, (R,R)+reg.2547 ± 604412 ± 15720 ± 3107 ± 12ND609 ± 184Tg, (S,S)+reg.2867 ± 1026470 ± 28325 ± 4193 ± 127134 ± 51407 ± 117 Open table in a new tab Immunohistochemical staining of livers for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; a convenient marker of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle) similarly revealed in the transgenic animals a total block of liver regeneration at 24 h after the operation, which was, however, dramatically released by the methylated analogues (Fig. 2B). Both the isomers of Me2Spm equally well restored the PCNA level yet were significantly (p < 0.01) less effective than MeSpd. As indicated in Fig. 2C, a close and highly significant correlation existed between PCNA-positive cells and the concentration of total polyamines (the natural and the analogues) in the regenerating liver. Interestingly, when nonlinear fitting (Boltzmann sigmoidal) (Fig. 2D) was used, it appeared that there was a sharp threshold (about 1000 pmol/mg) in the concentration of total polyamines, after which PCNA-positive cells started to appear. The Analogues Alleviate the Signs of Zinc-induced Pancreatitis in Transgenic Rats with Activated Polyamine Catabolism—Fig. 3 depicts plasma α-amylase activities (a widely used marker of acute pancreatitis) before and after induction of the pancreatitis in transgenic rats overexpressing SSAT under the control of heavy metal-inducible metallothionein promoter. The induction of the transgene led to a significant increase in the amylase activity at 24 h, whereas all the isomers reduced the enzyme activity. The inset in Fig. 3 indicates that also in pancreas, only (S,S)-Me2Spm was converted to MeSpd. Long-term Inhibition of Polyamine Biosynthesis in Cultured Cells—We next tested the ability of the analogues to maintain cellular growth during prolonged inhibition of polyamine biosynthesis in cultured DU145 cells. As shown in Table 2, DFMO efficiently depleted intracellular putrescine and spermidine and also reduced spermine levels. As depicted in Fig. 4, treatment with DFMO resulted in growth arrest, whereas all the stereoisomers of MeSpd and Me2Spm were able to maintain a near normal growth rate in the presence of DFMO during the first 6 days. Beyond this time point only (S)-MeSpd effectively sustained cell growth. The (S,S)-isomer supported growth better than the other Me2Spm isomers, and it was the only isomer converted to MeSpd.TABLE 2Polyamine and analogue concentrations in DU145 cellsDay and treatmentPutrescineSpermidineSpermineMeSpdMeSpmMe2Spmpmol/μg DNADay 0 Control109 ± 2344 ± 5180 ± 3Day 3 Control12 ± 2223 ± 58216 ± 59 DFMOND17 ± 3152 ± 19 DFMO + (R)-MeSpdND10 ± 123 ± 1325 ± 17111 ± 6ND DFMO + (S)-MeSpdND9 ± 031 ± 2432 ± 2175 ± 4ND DFMO + (R,R)-Me2SpmND19 ± 012 ± 0NDND308 ± 8 DFMO + (S,S)-Me2SpmND7 ± 111 ± 119 ± 7ND321 ± 9 DFMO + (R,S)-Me2SpmND4 ± 012 ± 0NDND308 ± 7Day 6 Control24 ± 3231 ± 20219 ± 18 DFMONDND114 ± 11 DFMO + (R)-MeSpdNDND10 ± 2292 ± 11109 ± 4ND DFMO + (S)-MeSpdNDND16 ± 6459 ± 6781 ± 12ND DFMO + (R,R)-Me2SpmNDND3 ± 1NDND257 ± 52 DFMO + (S,S)-Me2SpmNDND2 ± 022 ± 4ND280 ± 57 DFMO + (R,S)-Me2SpmNDND2 ± 0NDND282 ± 7Day 9 Control20 ± 2211 ± 15194 ± 12 DFMOND17 ± 495 ± 19 DFMO + (R)-MeSpdNDND6 ± 1247 ± 21119 ± 8ND DFMO + (S)-MeSpdNDND13 ± 3487 ± 4287 ± 16ND DFMO + (R,R)-Me2SpmNDNDNDNDND268 ± 5 DFMO + (S,S)-Me2SpmNDNDND33 ± 2ND282 ± 15 DFMO + (R,S)-Me2SpmNDNDNDNDND292 ± 18Day 12 Control25 ± 6256 ± 67224 ± 61 DFMO + (R)-MeSpdNDNDND244 ± 32111 ± 16ND DFMO + (S)-MeSpdNDNDND487 ± 4076 ± 6ND DFMO + (R,R)-Me2SpmNDNDNDNDND298 ± 20 DFMO + (S,S)-Me2SpmNDND2 ± 033 ± 1ND336 ± 16 DFMO + (R,S)-Me2SpmNDNDNDNDND353 ± 36 Open table in a new tab Conversion of the Stereoisomers of MeSpd and Me2Spm to Hypusine—The levels of active and precursor forms of eIF5A were measured by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting from DU145 cell samples cultured in the presence of DFMO and isomers for 9 or 12 days. Lysates from cells treated with l-mimosine or GC7 were analyzed for reference (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5A, (S)-MeSpd, but not the (R)-isomer, served as a substrate for hypusine synthesis. Only the (S,S)-isomer of Me2Spm yielded hypusinated eIF5A, yet the dominant forms were the acetylated precursor and precursor protein (Fig. 5B). Stereoisomers of Me2Spm as Substrates for Spermine Oxidase—As shown in Table 3, (S,S)-Me2Spm served as an excellent substrate for human recombinant SMO (in fact, according to kcat/Km value, even better than the natural substrate spermine) being nearly 500-fold more efficient substrate than the (R,R)-stereoisomer. The basal spermine oxidase activity in DU145 cells was 431 ± 92 pmol/mg/h.TABLE 3Spermine and stereoisomers of Me2Spm as substrates of recombinant spermine oxidaseSubstrateKmVmaxkcatkcat/Kmμmμmol/mins−1m−1 s−1Spermine8.0 ± 4.0681 ± 1911.4 ± 0.31,425,300Rac Me2Spm5.9 ± 0.4100 ± 1.91.7 ± 0.03288,136(R,R)-Me2Spm6.1 ± 0.42.3 ± 0.020.04 ± 0.00046,557(S,S)-Me2Spm2.0 ± 0.9358 ± 5.35.96 ± 0.092,980,000(R,S)-Me2Spm1.2 ± 0.414.3 ± 0.060.24 ± 0.001200,000 Open table in a new tab α-Methylated derivatives of spermidine and spermine apparently fulfill most of the putative cellular functions of the natural polyamines. This is in all likelihood related to the fact that, despite the methyl substitution(s), these compounds retain the charge distribution of the natural polyamines. As for being metabolically much more stable than spermidine and spermine (7Järvinen A. Grigorenko N. Khomutov A.R. Hyvönen M.T. Uimari A. Vepsäläinen J. Sinervirta R. Keinänen T.A. Vujcic S.

In addition to the numerous studies indicating that these methylated analogues effectively rescue cells from polyamine depletion-induced growth arrest (19Keinänen T.A. Järvinen A. Uimari A. Vepsäläinen J. Khomutov A.R. Grigorenko N. Hyvönen M.T. Cerrada-Gimenez M. Alhonen L. Jänne J. Mini Rev. Med. Chem. 2007; 7: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), they also promote other functions of the natural polyamines, such as the conversion of right-handed B-DNA to left-handed Z-DNA (20Lakanen J.R.

Chem. 2000; 28: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), hence apparently altering the template properties of DNA. The unique function of spermidine serving as the sole biosynthetic precursor of hypusine, an unusual amino acid covalently bound to eIF5A (3Park M.H. Cooper H.L. Folk J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2869-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), has created problems in assessing the role of the polyamines in growth promotion, as hypusinated eIF5A is critically required for animal cell proliferation (5Park M.H. Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 475-479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Hypusinated eIF5A appears to have a number of vital functions such as association with translating ribosomes (22Jao D.L. Chen K.Y. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 583-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), regulation of mRNA stability, and involvement in the process called nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (23Schrader R. Young C. Kozian D. Hoffmann R. Lottspeich F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35336-35346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) as well as control of p53-mediated apoptosis (24Li A.L.

Chem. 2004; 279: 49251-49258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A recent report likewise indicates that hypusinated eIF5A promotes neurite outgrowth and survival (25Huang Y. Higginson D.S. Hester L. Park M.H. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4194-4199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Some studies have suggested that growth inhibition resulting from reduced spermidine pools would be secondary to hypusine depletion (26Byers T.L. Ganem B. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), whereas others indicate that polyamine depletion-associated early cytostasis occurs in the absence of a depletion of hypusinated eIF5A (17Nishimura K.

Similarly, our previous studies, based on the use of methylated spermine derivatives, have suggested that polyamine depletion-induced acute antiproliferative effect is attributable to the reduced pools of spermidine and spermine per se (7Järvinen A. Grigorenko N. Khomutov A.R. Hyvönen M.T. Uimari A. Vepsäläinen J. Sinervirta R. Keinänen T.A. Vujcic S. Alhonen L. Porter C.W. Jänne J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6595-6601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The results of the present experiments with optically active isomers of Me2Spm revealed that (R,R)-, (S,S)-, and (R,S)-isomers rescued cells from polyamine depletion-associated early growth arrest equally effectively as MeSpd isomers, yet only the (S,S)-isomer was converted to (S)-MeSpd, i.e. to a hypusine precursor. After prolonged polyamine depletion, only (S)-MeSpd was able to support growth. The results show that polyamine depletion-induced cytostasis occurs in two phases; an acute phase where spermine and its derivatives can reverse the growth inhibition without their prior conversion to spermidine or its derivatives and a late, hypusine-dependent phase where spermine and its derivatives must be converted to spermidine or its derivatives capable of serving as precursors of hypusine. This finding implies that hypusinated eIF5A has a relatively long half-life as actually suggested by earlier studies (17Nishimura K. Murozumi K. Shirahata A. Park M.H. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 27Bergeron R.J. Weimar W.R. Muller R. Zimmerman C.O. McCosar B.H. Yao H. Smith R.E. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Interestingly, only a small amount of MeSpd was needed for hypusine synthesis, as demonstrated by the use of (S,S)-Me2Spm (Table 2). Growth inhibition achieved by DFMO, an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, is more rapid than that obtained by AbeAdo, an inhibitor of S-adenosyl-l-methionine decarboxylase. DFMO depletes putrescine and spermidine but does not usually affect spermine level, whereas AbeAdo depletes spermidine and spermine, but there is also a compensatory increase in putrescine level. Byers et al. (26Byers T.L. Ganem B. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) suggested that the greatly elevated putrescine could support cellular functions of polyamines until hypusinated eIF5A becomes depleted. However, as shown by our present results (Table 1, Fig. 2), the increased putrescine level was not sufficient to support hepatic proliferation in rats with activated polyamine catabolism. The mechanism of the acute growth inhibition caused by polyamine depletion is not well elucidated, but it may be related to the function of the replication machinery. Fredlund and Oredsson (28Fredlund J.O. Oredsson S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) showed that polyamine-depleted Chinese hamster ovary cells entered the S phase of cell cycle at normal rate, but the progression through the S phase was delayed. Depletion of putrescine and spermidine pools was accompanied by impaired DNA replication, whereas no changes occurred in the rate of RNA and protein synthesis. In an earlier study, polyamine supplementation at the time of S-phase initiation in synchronized HeLa cells restored DNA synthesis, with a lag of 3–6 h (29Gallo C.J. Koza R.A. Herbst E.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). On the other hand, some studies indicate that polyamine depletion causes G1 arrest (30Kramer D.L. Chang B.D. Chen Y. Diegelman P. Alm K. Black A.R. Roninson I.B. Porter C.W. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7754-7762PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the synthesis of deoxyhypusinated eIF5A appears to be stereospecific as only the (S)-isomer of MeSpd is used as a substrate. On the contrary, S-isomers of branched-chain derivatives of 1,7-diaminoheptane seem to have less activity in comparison to their racemic forms, but their unsaturated S-isomer derivatives display higher activity in comparison to their racemic forms (31Lee Y.B. Folk J.E. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1998; 6: 253-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A further interesting feature of the present results is the finding that also the oxidation of Me2Spm appears to be stereospecific to the (S,S)-isomer. We recently reported that mammalian polyamine oxidase, normally using achiral substrates, displays cryptic stereospecificity when α-methylated polyamines are used as the substrates (32Järvinen A.J. Cerrada-Gimenez M. Grigorenko N.A. Khomutov A.R. Vepsäläinen J.J. Sinervirta R.M. Keinänen T.A. Alhonen L.I. Jänne J. J. Med.

Vepsäläinen J. Alhonen L. Jänne J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4589-4595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) indicate that polyamine oxidase has a kcat/Km value (efficiency of the enzyme catalysis) for the (S,S)-isomer of Me2Spm that is nearly 30 times higher than that for the (R,R)-isomer. However, this difference may not be practically relevant as non-acetylated polyamines are poor substrates for mammalian polyamine oxidase in the absence of aldehydes. It is much more likely that the methylated spermine derivatives are oxidized in vivo by the recently discovered SMO, the natural substrate for which is spermine (34Wang Y. Devereux W. Woster P.M. Stewart T.M. Hacker A. Casero Jr., R.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5370-5373PubMed Google Scholar, 35Vujcic S. Diegelman P. Bacchi C.J. Kramer D.L. Porter C.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Because SMO specifically cleaves spermine to spermidine, it is tempting to speculate that it has evolved in animal cells to secure a continuous supply of spermidine for the synthesis of hypusine. This view is nicely supported by recent experiments with Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking both spermidine synthase and FMS1-encoded amine oxidase (yeast counterpart of SMO oxidizing spermine to spermidine). The mutated yeast cells showed an absolute requirement for spermidine, not replaceable by spermine, for their growth, as in the absence of the amine oxidase spermine is not converted to spermidine required for hypusine biosynthesis (36Chattopadhyay M.K.

For example, yeast with mutations in the CDC48 gene, an AAA family member involved in the fusion of endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles (10Latterich M. Frohlich K.U. Schekman R. Cell. 1995; 82: 885-893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), exhibit characteristic hallmarks of apoptotic cell death including DNA fragmentation, chromatin remodeling (11Ahn S.H.

Similarly, expression of a mutant form of the mammalian ortholog of CDC48, valosin containing protein, induces mammalian cells to undergo apoptosis (13Shirogane T. Fukada T. Muller J.M. Shima D.T.

Science. 1993; 262: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar), whereas expression of the pro-apoptotic counterpart Bax or Bak kills yeast in a manner that resembles PCD induced by these proteins in mammalian cells. Upon expression in yeast, Bax localizes mainly in the mitochondria and promotes mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization (19Gross A. Pilcher K. Blachly-Dyson E. Basso E. Jockel J. Bassik M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. Forte M. Mol. Cell.

Leskov K. Boothman D.A. Matsuyama S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Previous work in our laboratory isolated a series of EMS-mutagenized yeast strains that exhibited resistance to Bax-induced PCD (25Belhocine S. Mbithe C. Dimitrova I. Kampranis S.C. Makris A.M. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 946-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To further exploit the effect of Bax and obtain insights on the yeast PCD machinery, we have here utilized one such mutant that failed to target Bax to mitochondria, in a reverse genetic screen to identify yeast proteins that restore sensitivity to Bax. This screen identified the C terminus of the conserved flavin mononucleotide (FMN) oxidoreductase OYE2. Suggestively, the highly related OYE3 protein, which is known to heterodimerize with OYE2 (26Stott K. Saito K. Thiele D.J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6097-6106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), had previously been found to modulate Bax-dependent PCD in yeast (27Reekmans R. De Smet K. Chen C. Van Hummelen P. Contreras R. FEMS Yeast Res. 2005; 5: 711-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the current study, we show that full-length OYE2 suppressed Bax lethality in wild type yeast, and is a potent antioxidant protein. This activity contrasts with that of OYE3, which antagonized the protective action of OYE2 in H2O2-induced programmed cell death. The effect of OYE3 requires the presence of OYE2, indicating that it is the oye2p-oye3p heterodimer that facilitates PCD. Surprisingly, the absence of both genes rendered cells hyper-resistant to H2O2-induced PCD by increasing their respiratory efficiency. Deletion of OYE2 with other antioxidant genes elevated endogenous ROS and sensitized cells further to H2O2-induced PCD. In the case of Δoye2 glr1 cells, the cellular redox environment with high levels of oxidized glutathione led to gross morphological aberrations, actin cytoskeleton abnormalities, and defects in organelle partition between mother and daughter cells. Together, these results indicate that OYE2 is a connection point between ROS generation, modulation of PCD, and cytoskeletal regulation. Genetic Screen in Yeast—A previously characterized EMS mutagenized yeast strain R13 (his3 ura3 trp1 LexA-operator-LEU2) carrying the pGILDA/Bax plasmid was transformed with a yeast genomic library on the plasmid pJG4-5 (25Belhocine S. Mbithe C. Dimitrova I. Kampranis S.C. Makris A.M. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 946-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Growing colonies were replica plated on glucose/CM-His,Trp, and galactose-raffinose/CM-His,Trp. Colonies growing on glucose media but not on galactose, where Bax is expressed, were selected for further characterization. The library plasmids were extracted and then reintroduced into fresh cells and were tested for the reproducibility of the Bax resensitization phenotype. The library plasmids capable of restoring Bax lethality were sequenced. Growth Recovery Curves—Fresh overnight cultures of the various yeast strains grown in Glu/CM media or glucose media lacking the amino acid used as auxotrophic marker were washed with dH2O and resuspended in fresh medium at A600 = 0.1. Aliquots were taken at regular intervals and the absorbance was measured. When A600 > 1, aliquots were serially diluted and new measurements were taken. To examine the effect of a transient pulse of H2O2 in cultures overexpressing the OYE proteins, fresh cells were resuspended at A600 = 0.1 in fresh glucose media and 2 h later, at the end of the lag period, the cultures were supplemented with 1.5 or 1.25 mm H2O2 and incubated with shaking at 30 °C. The ability of the cell populations to recover from the H2O2 insult was assessed by measuring growth at A600 at regular intervals. All growth recovery assays were performed independently in triplicate. Plasmid Constructs—The full-lengths of the OYE2 and OYE3 genes were PCR amplified from wild type yeast genomic DNA using primers 5′OYE2(EcoRI) 5′-GAATTCATGCCATTTGTTAAGGACTTTAAGCC-3′ and 3′OYE2(XhoI) 5′-CTCGAGTTAATTTTTGTCCCAACCGAGTTTTAG-3′ for OYE2 and 5′OYE3 5′-CAATTGATGCCATTTGTAAAAGGTTTTGAGCCGATC-3′ and 3′OYE3 5′-CTCGAGTCAGTTCTTGTTCCAACCTAAATCTACTGC-3′ for OYE3. A fusion of the OYE2 with GFP in the C terminus was prepared using a two-step PCR approach with overlapping primers. In the first step, OYE2 was amplified using primers 5′OYE2(EcoRI) and 3′OYE2(GFP), 5′-CTCGCCCTTGCTCACATTTTTGTCCCAACC-3′, and the GFP construct was amplified using the 5′OYE-GFP 5′-GGTTGGGACAAAAATGTGAGCAAGGGCGAC-3′ and the 3′GFP(XhoI) 5′-CTCGAGTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCC-3′. The amplified products from the first round were gel extracted and purified. A small aliquot of the two fragments was mixed in a new PCR using the 5′OYE2(EcoRI) and the 3′GFP(XhoI) external primers. All PCR amplifications were made using Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). The purified fragments were cloned into the pCR2.1 TOPO TA vector according to the manufacturer's instructions. All the cloned inserts were subsequently subcloned into the yeast expression vectors: pJG4-6, expressing the proteins under a galactose promoter; and pYX143 and pYX143-HA (hemagglutinin tagged), which are low copy number vectors (ARS/CEN, LEU2) expressing the genes under the control of the constitutive TPI promoter. Expression of the proteins was verified in PYX143-HA and pJG4-6 in Western blots using antibodies against the HA tag. BY4741 wild type yeast cells were transformed with pYX143-OYE2, pYX143-OYE3, or a control empty plasmid. Protein expression was verified indirectly by parallel cloning of the OYE2 and OYE3 cDNAs into the pYX143-HA vector, which expresses the cDNAs fused to a hemagglutinin tag. However, the untagged vectors were used in all subsequent experiments to eliminate the possibility of any interference of the HA tag. A C-terminal-truncated construct of OYE2 was generated by PCR using the primer 5′OYE2 and 3′OYE2 (1-388) 5′-CTCGAGCTACGTAGGGTAGTCAATGTA-3′. The product was sequenced and subcloned into the pYX143-HA and pYX143 vectors. Mutation of tyrosine 197 to phenylalanine in OYE2 was generated according to the directions of the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis protocol from Stratagene. The complementary primers OYE2(Y197F)5 5′-CCACAGCGCTAACGGTTTCTTGTTGAACCAGTTCTTG-3′ and OYE2(Y197F)3 3′-CAAGAACTGGTTCAACAAGAAACCGTTAGCGCTGTGG-3′ were used in a PCR run for 16 rounds using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase. Subsequent to DpnI digestion of nonmutated parental DNA, the digest was used to transform bacterial cells. Plasmid DNA from isolated colonies was sequenced to verify the mutation. The Y197F OYE2 cDNA was subcloned into pYX143, pYX143-HA yeast vectors as above. Flow Cytometric Studies—Yeast strains growing in glucose complete media, untill late logarithmic phase, were washed with PBS and stained. Dihydroethidium (HE; D-1168, Molecular Probes) at 4 μm was used as an indicator of endogenous ROS. Yeast cells harboring plasmids were grown in glucose complete media lacking the amino acid used as the auxotrophic marker. To assess cellular responses to pro-oxidants, aliquots of grown cells were treated for 1 h with 1.5 mm hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), 1 mm t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH), or 0.2 mm cumene hydroperoxide (CHP). Subsequent to treatment, cells were washed extensively with PBS by repeated centrifugations and finally stained with HE as above. Using FACS, 100,000 cells from each sample were measured. Quantification was performed using the Cytomation software (DAKO). Microscopy and Fluorescence Measurements—Mitochondrial import and morphology was visualized using plasmid pVT100U-mitGFP or plasmid pYX142-mitGFP (which expresses GFP fused to a mitochondrial matrix targeting sequence), which were introduced in yeast cells (28Westermann B. Neupert W. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The organelles were observed in a single plane so as to observe the relative diameter of the tubules. Actin filaments were stained by fixing with 4% formaldehyde and staining using rhodamine-phalloidin (R-415, Molecular Probes). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342. To mask fluorescence from mitochondrial DNA a low dose of Mitotracker Red CMXRos (M7512, Molecular Probes) was used as a counterstain. The lumen of yeast vacuoles was stained with 50 μm CMAC (Y-7531, Molecular Probes) for 20 min. At the end of incubations cells were washed twice, resuspended in prewarmed PBS, applied on microscope slides and observed under ×1000 magnification in a fluorescent microscope. Necrotic cells with permeabilized outer membranes were measured by Evans blue staining. In addition to FACS analysis, ROS were also measured using a PerkinElmer LS55 Luminescence spectrometer. Fresh cultures of cells were resuspended in PBS at A600 = 0.5 and 1-ml aliquots of cells were stained with Mitotracker Red CMXRos (M-7512, Molecular Probes) for 15 min in the dark and washed once with PBS, at the end of incubation the cells were resuspended in 2 ml and fluorescence was measured over the optimal emission range. Generation of Double Knock-out Yeast Strains—A yeast strain harboring a deletion of the OYE2 gene was generated by integrating a URA3 cassette originating from the pUG72 plasmid (29Gueldener U. Heinisch J. Koehler G.J. Voss D. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e23Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). The primers 5′OYE2 lox 5′-TCATATTAAGCTAAATATAGACGATAATATAGTATCGATAATGCCACAGCTGAAGCTTCGTACGC-3′ and 3′OYE2 lox 5′-AAATGGTGCTACAAAGTACGGTTAACACTATTAATTTTTGTCCCAACCGCATAGGCCACTAGTGGATCTG-3′, which contain flanking sequences from the 5′ and 3′ of the OYE2 gene, were used to amplify the cassette in a PCR. The amplified DNA fragment was purified and transformed into a Matα strain that originated by repeated backcrosses to a BY4741 background. Proper integration of the URA cassette was verified by PCR using primers 5′GenOYE2, 5′-CACGACAAGATTCTTCTATTGATTATTCACATATGT-3′, and 3′OYE2 lox. To generate double knockouts the Δoye2::URA3 strain was mated to BY4741 deletion strains Δoye3, Δsod1, Δctt1, Δglr1, Δyca1, and Δgsh1 (Research Genetics), which harbor the G418 antibiotic resistance marker on the deleted gene. Diploid cells were induced to sporulate and the regenerating spores were tested in Glu/CM-ura, +G418 plates. The mating type of the double knock-out haploid strains was subsequently assessed. ρ0 strains (lacking functional mitochondria) were generated from the ρ+ Δoye2 oye3 strain by growing cells in YPD broth containing 10 μg/ml ethidium bromide for 3 days (30Braun R.J. Zischka H. Madeo F. Eisenberg T. Wissing S. Buttner S. Engelhardt S.M. Buringer D. Ueffing M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25757-25767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Dilutions were plated on YPD plates and growing colonies were tested for their capacity to grow on YPGlycerol media. Induction of PCD with H2O2 and Acetic Acid and Colony Viability Assays—Cells growing in logarithmic phase were used to inoculate at very low density in fresh glucose media. A small aliquot was subsequently removed, serially diluted, and plated on rich YPD plates. This represented the 0 time point and viability of 100%. To the diluted cells, H2O2 was added to 1 mm, and cells were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C. Treated cells were enumerated as above and compared with the original count. All experiments were performed independently in triplicate. The presence of necrotic cells was determined by staining with Evans blue and visualization by light microscopy. Acetic acid-induced PCD was performed in accordance to the protocol described by Ludovico et al. (5Ludovico P. Sousa M.J. Silva M.T. Leao C. Corte-Real M. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 2409-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) using unbuffered Glu/CM media. Chronological Aging Assays—All strains were grown in 10-ml cultures with unbuffered glucose complete media (2% glucose) untill saturation. At the end of the second day of incubation, a small aliquot of cells was removed and the number of live cells was enumerated by serial dilution and plating on YPD plates. This corresponded to the 0 time point. Aliquots of cells were removed regularly and cells were enumerated as above. Determination of Total Glutathione and Glutathione Disulfide—BY4741, Δoye2, Δoye3, Δoye2 oye3, and Δoye2 glr1 cells were grown untill late log phase in Glu/CM. Total glutathione and glutathione disulfide were measured according to a method described by Griffith (31Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4034) Google Scholar) and modified by Kampranis et al. (22Kampranis S.C. Damianova R. Atallah M. Toby G. Kondi G. Tsichlis P.N. Makris A.M. J. Biol.

The FMN Oxidoreductase OYE2 Limits Bax-induced Lethality in Yeast—To identify yeast genes that participate in PCD processes we took advantage of the Bax-induced lethal phenotype in yeast. The Bax-resistant EMS-mutant strain R13, which exhibits defects in mitochondrial protein targeting (25Belhocine S. Mbithe C. Dimitrova I. Kampranis S.C. Makris A.M. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 946-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), was used in a screen to identify yeast proteins that can restore Bax sensitivity. We transformed cells containing a galactose-inducible Bax expression plasmid with a yeast genomic library cloned into the pJG4-5, galactose-inducible, yeast expression vector. Transformed yeast were initially plated on glucose-selective plates at low density to enable us to pick distinct colonies. Approximately 3,000 colonies were replica-plated on glucose and galactose-selective media to induce Bax and library expression from the galactose promoter. One of the library clones that converted Bax-resistant R13 cells back to sensitivity contained the C terminus of OYE2 from amino acid 314 to the end of the gene (amino acids 314-400). The gene is translated from a proximal ATG supplied from the pJG4-5 vector (Fig. 1). Reekmans et al. (27Reekmans R. De Smet K. Chen C. Van Hummelen P. Contreras R. FEMS Yeast Res. 2005; 5: 711-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have recently shown that deletion of OYE3, an FMN oxidoreductase homologous to OYE2, attenuated Bax-induced growth arrest, cell death, and caused a decrease in NADPH in yeast. Among the EMS mutant yeasts we previously generated, which are resistant to Bax-induced PCD, a significant proportion also showed defects in protein transport to mitochondria, most likely limiting integration of Bax to the outer membrane. Expression of OYE2-(314-400) in R13 cells not only sensitized cells to Bax lethality (Fig. 1A), but also restored the ability of GFP fused to a mitochondrial targeting sequence (mit-GFP) to associate with mitochondria (Fig. 1C), indicating that OYE2 can affect mitochondrial targeting. The size of R13 cells also decreased and resembled wild type appearance. In wild type yeast, Bax causes changes in the morphology of the mitochondria. Whereas in a percentage of cells the organelles become fragmented, the remaining cells exhibit fewer swollen organelles most likely by fusion as a defense response (Fig. 1B). YFP-Bax localized to mitochondria in wild type cells, whereas in the R13 Bax-resistant mutant the YFP fusion clearly fails to target the organelles (Fig. 1B, bottom row). Co-expression of YFP-Bax with the OYE2-(314-400) C terminus reversed the diffused fluorescence, however, only very weak peripheral fluorescence could be detected (data not shown). YFP-Bax is lethal to R13 cells, only when co-expressed with the OYE2-(314-400) despite the difficulty in detecting its fluorescence. Recently TOM22, a component of the complex responsible for initial import of mitochondrial targeted proteins was identified as a Bax receptor (32Bellot G. Cartron P.F. Er E. Oliver L. Juin P. Armstrong L.C. Bornstein P. Mihara K. Manon S. Vallette F.M. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 14: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This could explain the frequent association between Bax resistance and defects in mitochondrial protein translocation in our mutants (25Belhocine S. Mbithe C. Dimitrova I. Kampranis S.C. Makris A.M. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 946-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We next overexpressed the full-length open reading frame of OYE2 from the pJG4-4 vector, under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter. In wild type EGY48 cells expressing Bax, overexpression of the full-length OYE2 suppressed Bax lethality, whereas the C terminus OYE2 could not do so (Fig. 2A). OYE2 also reversed to a large extent mitochondrial swelling, as well as excessive mitochondrial fission, both characteristic effects of Bax expression in sensitive yeast strains (Fig. 2B). Full-length OYE2 did not resensitize the R13 mutant cells to Bax (data not shown), suggesting that this action of the OYE2-(314-400) represented a dominant negative effect of the truncated protein. Supporting the OYE2 protective role, Bax expression in Δoye2 was more toxic compared with wild type yeast (data not shown). OYE2 Localizes to Mitochondria—As OYE2 was isolated based on restoring Bax sensitivity to a strain with deficient localization of Bax to its site of action, the mitochondria, we asked if OYE2 might itself associate with mitochondria. A full-length OYE2-GFP fusion was introduced into EGY48 cells under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter. OYE2-GFP localized to distinct domains in the cytoplasm that partially overlapped with mitochondria (Fig. 2C). This indicates that OYE2 localized on the organelle and can thus limit directly the capacity of Bax to insert and oligomerize on the mitochondrial outer membrane. The OYE2-GFP fusion weakly protected wild type cells from Bax lethality and did not act as dominant negative (data not shown). OYE2 and OYE3 Have Opposing Functions in Regulation of Oxidative Stress in Wild Type Yeast—Bax-induced lethality in yeast is strongly linked to enhanced intracellular oxidative stress (33Dimitrova I. Toby G.G. Tili E. Strich R. Kampranis S.C. Makris A.M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 566: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). OYE3 modulates Bax-dependent PCD (27Reekmans R. De Smet K. Chen C. Van Hummelen P. Contreras R. FEMS Yeast Res. 2005; 5: 711-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and heterodimerizes with OYE2 in vivo and in vitro (26Stott K. Saito K. Thiele D.J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6097-6106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, OYE2 and OYE3 share 82% identity at the amino acid level, suggesting a related activity. To elucidate the functional relationship of OYE2, and OYE3, we expressed them at moderate levels in yeast and assessed basal and induced levels of oxidative stress. Yeast overexpressing OYE2 or OYE3, or vector-transformed control cells, were treated with 1.5 mm H2O2, with 1 mm of the prooxidant tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH), and with 0.2 mm of the prooxidant CHP. After incubation, cells were stained with HE to gauge oxidative stress: Fig. 3A compares FACS-determined HE values for cells overexpressing OYE2 or OYE3 (hatched lines) in reference to cells expressing empty vector (vertical lines) for each condition. In untreated cells, overexpression of OYE2 modestly lowered (-13%), and OYE3 elevated (+24%), endogenous ROS"
https://openalex.org/W1977052381,"The expression of selenoproteins requires the translational recoding of the UGA stop codon to selenocysteine. In eukaryotes, this requires an RNA stem loop structure in the 3′-untranslated region, termed a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS), and SECIS-binding protein 2 (SBP2). This study implicates SBP2 in dictating the hierarchy of selenoprotein expression, because it is the first to show that SBP2 distinguishes between SECIS elements in vitro. Using RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we demonstrate that a naturally occurring mutation in SBP2, which correlates with abnormal thyroid hormone function in humans, lies within a novel, bipartite RNA-binding domain. This mutation alters the RNA binding affinity of SBP2 such that it no longer stably interacts with a subset of SECIS elements. Assays performed under competitive conditions to mimic intracellular conditions suggest that the differential affinity of SBP2 for various SECIS elements will determine the expression pattern of the selenoproteome. We hypothesize that the selective loss of a subset of selenoproteins, including some involved in thyroid hormone homeostasis, is responsible for the abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism previously observed in the affected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W1990054118,"We have investigated the effect of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) on the production of extracellular matrix-degrading proteases in skeletal muscles. Using microarray, quantitative PCR, Western blotting, and zymography, we found that TNF-α drastically increases the production of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 from C2C12 myotubes. In vivo administration of TNF-α in mice increased the transcript level of MMP-9 in skeletal muscle tissues. Although TNF-α activated all the three MAPKs (i.e. ERK1/2, JNK, and p38), inhibition of ERK1/2 or p38 but not JNK blunted the TNF-α-induced production of MMP-9 from myotubes. Inhibition of Akt also inhibited the TNF-α-induced production of MMP-9. TNF-α increased the activation of transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 but not SP-1 in myotubes. Overexpression of a dominant negative inhibitor of NF-κB or AP-1 blocked the TNF-α-induced expression of MMP-9 in myotubes. Similarly, point mutations in AP-1- or NF-κB-binding sites in MMP-9 promoter inhibited the TNF-α-induced expression of a reporter gene. TNF-α increased the activity of transforming growth factor-β-activating kinase-1 (TAK1). Furthermore, overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of TAK1 blocked the TNF-α-induced expression of MMP-9 and activation of NF-κB and AP-1. Our results also suggest that TNF-α induces MMP-9 expression in muscle cells through the recruitment of TRAF-2, Fas-associated protein with death domain, and TNF receptor-associated protein with death domain but not NIK or TRAF-6 proteins. We conclude that TAK1-mediated pathways are involved in TNF-α-induced MMP-9 production in skeletal muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W2034612120,"The skin human papillomavirus (HPV) types belonging to the genus beta of the HPV phylogenetic tree appear to be associated with nonmelanoma skin cancer. We previously showed that the beta HPV type 38 E6 and E7 oncoproteins are able to inactivate the tumor suppressors p53 and retinoblastoma. Here, both viral proteins were expressed in primary human skin keratinocytes in order to study their effects on the telomere/telomerase system. We show that immortalization of skin keratinocytes induced by HPV38 E6/E7 is associated with hTERT gene overexpression. This event is, in part, explained by the accumulation of the p53-related protein, DeltaNp73. Despite elevated levels of hTERT mRNA, the telomerase activity detected in HPV38 E6/E7 keratinocytes was lower than that observed in HPV16 E6/E7 keratinocytes. The low telomerase activation in highly proliferative HPV38 E6/E7 keratinocytes resulted in the presence of extremely short and unstable telomeres. In addition, we observed anaphase bridges, mitotic multipolarity, and dramatic genomic aberrations. Interestingly, the ectopic expression of hTERT prevents both telomere erosion and genomic instability. Thus, we showed that in HPV38 E6/E7 keratinocytes characterized by unscheduled proliferation, suboptimal activation of telomerase and subsequent extensive telomere shortening result in genomic instability facilitating cellular immortalization."
https://openalex.org/W2053333991,"In bacteria, functionally related gene products are often encoded by a common transcript. Such polycistronic transcripts are rare in eukaryotes. Here we isolated several clones from human cDNA libraries, which rescued the respiratory-deficient phenotype of a yeast mitochondrial 3-hydroxyacyl thioester dehydratase 2 (htd2) mutant strain. All complementing cDNAs were derived from the RPP14 transcript previously described to encode the RPP14 subunit of the human ribonuclease P (RNase P) complex. We identified a second, 3' open reading frame (ORF) on the RPP14 transcript encoding a protein showing similarity to known dehydratases and hydratase 2 enzymes. The protein was localized in mitochondria, and the recombinant enzyme exhibited (3R)-specific hydratase 2 activity. Based on our results, we named the protein human 3-hydroxyacyl-thioester dehydratase 2 (HsHTD2), which is involved in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis. The bicistronic arrangement of RPP14 and HsHTD2, as well as the general exon structure of the gene, is conserved in vertebrates from fish to humans, indicating a genetic link conserved for 400 million years between RNA processing and mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis."

Understanding how to modulate the interaction of Eph receptors with their ephrin ligands is therefore of critical interest for the development of therapeutics to treat cancer. Previous work identified a set of 12-mer peptides that displayed moderate binding affinity but high selectivity for the EphB2 receptor. The SNEW antagonistic peptide inhibited the interaction of EphB2 with ephrinB2, with an IC50 of ∼15 μm. To gain a better molecular understanding of how to inhibit Eph/ephrin binding, we determined the crystal structure of the EphB2 receptor in complex with the SNEW peptide to 2.3-Å resolution. The peptide binds in the hydrophobic ligand-binding cleft of the EphB2 receptor, thus competing with the ephrin ligand for receptor binding. However, the binding interactions of the SNEW peptide are markedly different from those described for the TNYL-RAW peptide, which binds to the ligand-binding cleft of EphB4, indicating a novel mode of antagonism. Nevertheless, we identified a conserved structural motif present in all known receptor/ligand interfaces, which may serve as a scaffold for the development of therapeutic leads.

In addition, similar to EphB4, EphB2 on the surface of tumor cells may promote tumor angiogenesis by interacting with ephrinB2 in tumor blood vessels (25Noren N.K. Lu M. Freeman A.L. Koolpe M. Pasquale E.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5583-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Therefore, targeting EphB2 represents a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention. Peptides and chemical compounds that bind to EphB2 may be used to target anti-cancer agents to EphB2-expressing tumors (26Mao W. Luis E. Ross S. Silva J. Tan C. Crowley C. Chui C. Franz G. Senter P. Koeppen H. Polakis P. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and, in certain tumor types, interfering with EphB2 ligand binding should inhibit tumor progression and tumor angiogenesis. The Eph receptors and the ephrin ligands are classified into two major classes, A or B, based on their sequence identities and ligand binding preferences. Class A receptors (EphA1-EphA10) bind preferentially to ephrinA ligands (ephrinA1-ephrinA6), whereas class B receptors (EphB1–EphB6) bind preferentially to ephrinB ligands (ephrinB1–ephrinB3) (27Gale N.W. Holland S.J. Valenzuela D.M. Flenniken A. Pan L. Ryan T.E. Henkemeyer M. Strebhardt K. Hirai H. Wilkinson D.G. Pawson T. Davis S. Yancopoulos G.D. Neuron. 1996; 17: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Although the Eph receptors bind promiscuously the ephrins of the same A or B class, interactions across classes are rare (28Pasquale E.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 417-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). An interesting feature of the Eph/ephrin interaction is the fact that both the receptor and the ligand are membrane bound, and are capable of transducing signals bidirectionally either in the forward direction through the Eph receptor cytoplasmic domain, or in the reverse direction through the ephrin, to elicit a series of biological responses in both receptor- and ephrin-expressing cells. The domain architecture of the Eph receptors is highly conserved. The cytoplasmic region of the receptors consists of a juxtamembrane region, a kinase domain, a SAM domain (sterile α-domain), and a PDZ binding motif (PSD-95 post-synaptic density protein, Discs large, and Zona occludens tight junction protein). Extracellularly, the receptors contain a ligand-binding domain at the N terminus, a cysteine-rich region, and two fibronectin type III repeats. The ligand-binding domain of the Eph receptor has been characterized as the minimal region required for high affinity interaction with the ephrins (29Himanen J.P. Rajashankar K.R. Lackmann M. Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nature. 2001; 414: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The ephrin ligands also have a structurally conserved extracellular domain characterized by a Greek-key topology. The ligands deviate, however, in their attachment to the cell membrane. The ephrinB ligands contain a transmembrane region, whereas the ephrinA ligands are anchored to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage. Previously reported crystal structures of Eph receptors in complex with a ligand revealed a heterodimerization interface on the surface of the Eph receptor ligand-binding domain that mediates a high affinity receptor/ligand interaction. In addition, a lower affinity tetramerization interface was identified in EphB2-ephrinB2 complex crystals that mediated the multimerization of EphB2 receptor/ephrinB2 dimers (29Himanen J.P. Rajashankar K.R. Lackmann M. Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nature. 2001; 414: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In the high affinity interface, the G–H loop of the ephrin inserts into the hydrophobic ligand-binding cavity formed by the D–E, G–H, and J–K loops of the Eph receptor, resulting in a nanomolar binding affinity (29Himanen J.P.

Previously, the crystal structure of the EphB4 receptor in complex with the high affinity (40 nm) and antagonistic TNYL-RAW (TNYLFSPNGPIARAW) peptide was elucidated (31Chrencik J.E. Brooun A. Recht M.I. Kraus M.L. Koolpe M. Kolatkar A.R. Bruce R.H. Martiny-Baron G. Widmer H. Pasquale E.B. Kuhn P. Structure. 2006; 14: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The structure revealed that the antagonistic peptide binds within the EphB4 ligand binding cavity, precluding interaction with the G–H loop of ephrinB2. Phage display screens have identified a series of 12-mer peptides that target the ligand-binding domains of several Eph receptors and antagonize their interactions with ephrins, whereas maintaining exceptional specificity for a particular Eph receptor (32Koolpe M. Burgess R. Dail M. Pasquale E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17301-17311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). One peptide, SNEW (SNEWIQPRLPQH), displayed moderate affinity and high selectivity for the EphB2 receptor, and inhibited EphB2 signaling pathways in cells (32Koolpe M. Burgess R. Dail M.

Martina J.A. McCormick P.J. Tosato G. Blood. 2006; 108: 2914-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular determinants of the EphB2-SNEW interaction, we determined the crystal structure of the complex at 2.3-Å resolution. The structure reveals that the peptide binds as expected in the hydrophobic ligand binding cleft of the receptor, explaining its ability to inhibit ephrin binding. The overall binding interface of the SNEW peptide is small, and dominated by hydrophobic interactions and weak polar interactions. Thermodynamic characterization of the EphB2 ligand-binding domain-SNEW complex revealed a low micromolar binding affinity, consistent with the weak interaction network observed in the crystal structure. Comparison of the EphB2-SNEW complex with the EphB4/TNYL-RAW complex revealed significant differences in the binding interfaces of the two peptides. However, a conserved structural motif (Ile or Pro) has now been identified in all known Eph receptor/ligand crystal structures. This motif has a critical role in stabilizing a conserved disulfide bridge in the Eph receptor. Together with previously available structural information, our data should accelerate drug discovery efforts aimed at targeting the extracellular Eph/ephrin protein-protein interaction. Protein Expression and Purification—The human EphB2 construct was designed based on similarity with the human EphB4 receptor previously described. EphB2-(28–203) was expressed in baculovirus in Hi5 insect cells as described elsewhere (30Chrencik J.E. Brooun A. Kraus M.L. Recht M.I. Kolatkar A.R. Han G.W. Seifert J.M. Widmer H. Auer M. Kuhn P.

Media containing secreted EphB2 was concentrated and buffer exchanged using a Hydrosart Crossflow filter (Sartorius, NY). The secreted protein was bound to Probond IMAC resin (Invitrogen), washed with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 400 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole buffer and eluted with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 400 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole. Following IMAC purification, the receptor was concentrated to 5 mg/ml and loaded onto a Phenomenex S2000 column (Phenomenex, CA) to remove aggregated material. Crystallization and Data Collection—The EphB2 receptor was concentrated to 5 mg/ml in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2 in the presence of a 5-fold molar excess of SNEW peptide (SNEWIQPRLPQH, Biopeptide, Inc.), and crystallized by sitting drop vapor diffusion at 20 °C against a reservoir of 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, and 20% PEG-3350. The crystals were cryoprotected in 25% propylene glycol, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Crystals of the EphB2-SNEW complex formed in the P32 space group (a = b = 40.18, c = 238.03). A single crystal diffracted to 2.3-Å resolution at 100 K on the GM/CA-CAT beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne). Data were processed and reduced using the HKL2000 package (36Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C. Sweet R. Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar). The calculated Matthews coefficient (VM) suggested that the EphB2-SNEW complex existed as a dimer. The structure was determined by molecular replacement with MolRep (CCP4i) (37P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) using the structure of apo-EphB2 (Protein Data Bank code 1NUK (38Himanen J.P. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)) as a search model. The structure was refined with Refmac5 (CCP4i) using torsion angle dynamics and the maximum likelihood function target (Table 1), and manual model building performed in Coot (37P4 CC Acta Crystallogr.

All 176 residues of EphB2, as well as 11 of 12 residues from the SNEW peptide, were readily modeled into the electron density. The final structure exhibits good geometry with no Ramachandran outliers as per Molprobity (41Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall 3rd, W.B. de Bakker P.I. Word J.M. Prisant M.G. Richardson J.S.

The SNEW peptide and all mutant peptides were dissolved in the dialysis buffer. All ITC experiments were performed with a Microcal MCS ITC at 25 °C. ITC experiments were performed as described previously (30Chrencik J.E. Brooun A. Kraus M.L. Recht M.I. Kolatkar A.R. Han G.W. Seifert J.M. Widmer H. Auer M. Kuhn P. J. Biol.

In Silico Combinatorial Mutagenesis—All in silico mutagenesis analyses were conducted with the ICM program (42Abagyan R. Totrov M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 983-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar) and incorporated the SNEW structure as a template. First, the structure was regularized with a multistep procedure. This consists of creating full-atom geometrical approximation model, rotational positioning of methyl groups, iterative optimization of geometry, and energy of the whole structure, and adjustment of polar hydrogen positions. Finally, free minimization was performed to relieve any bad contacts and check the consistency of the resulting structure. Next, residues 1 through 9 of the peptide were each mutated to all 20 amino acids individually, resulting in 120 new peptides. After each mutation, a full energy optimization of the new side chain was then performed using the Monte Carlo procedure. The associated energy includes van der Waals terms, a hydrophobicity term based on the solvent accessible surface buried upon binding, a solvation electrostatic term using a boundary-element solution of the Poisson equation, a hydrogen-bond interaction term, and the entropic contribution (43Totrov M. Abagyan R. Biopolymers. 2001; 60: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For the double and triple mutants, three peptide mutation positions, 3, 6, and 8, were kept constant based on the highest scoring candidates from the previous round. The combinatorial approach was then repeated with the remaining positions in a similar manner as the first round. Finally, an empirical scoring function between the receptor and each peptide was calculated and stored in a table. Six single mutants, two double mutants, and a triple mutant peptide were then selected based on high scores and rational feasibility, to be synthesized and tested by ITC. The overall structure of the human EphB2 ligand-binding domain in complex with the antagonistic SNEW peptide was refined to a 2.3-Å resolution and a free R factor of 27%. The structure of EphB2 in complex with SNEW is similar to that of the apo-EphB2 receptor (38Himanen J.P. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and consists of a jellyroll folding topology with 13 β-strands arranged into 2 antiparallel β-sheets forming a compact β-sandwich (Fig. 1). The β-sheets are connected by loops that vary in amino acid number and are characterized by a high degree of flexibility. For example, the D–E and J–K loops are disordered in the apo-EphB2 structure due to their inherent flexibility. However, binding of the antagonistic SNEW peptide promotes the ordering of these loops. The EphB2 structure is further stabilized by two conserved disulfide bridges, one in the G–H loop, and the other in the E–F/L–M loops (Cys105/Cys115 and Cys70/Cys192, respectively). The peptide-bound and apo-EphB2 structures superpose well, with an overall root mean square deviation of 1.7 Å over 178 respective Cα atoms. Furthermore, the EphB2-SNEW complex superposes well with respect to the ephrinB2- and ephrinA5-bound EphB2 structures, with root mean square deviations of 2.7 and 1.9 Å, respectively. Although the core of the EphB2 ligand-binding domain remains unchanged in the apo and peptide-bound structures, as well as the peptide-bound EphB4 structure, there are notable differences in the surface-exposed loop regions, particularly the D–E, G–H, and J–K loops (Fig. 2) (29Himanen J.P.

Interestingly, the J–K loops from the EphB2-bound structures (PDB code 1NUK and 1KGY) are generally positioned toward the D–E loop, whereas the J–K loops from the EphB4-bound structures (PDB codes 2BBA and 2HLE) are positioned toward the G–H loop (29Himanen J.P.

Nature. 1998; 396: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)}. The J–K loop from the EphB2-SNEW complex is positioned between these two formations, which is a result of the N-terminal residues of the SNEW peptide, which sterically precludes the J–K loop from occupying the area closer the D–E loop, as in the EphB2/ephrinB2 structure (29Himanen J.P. Rajashankar K.R. Lackmann M. Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nature. 2001; 414: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The structural flexibility of these loops in several ligand-bound EphB forms has been well documented, and it allows the receptors to use an induced fit mechanism to recognize and accommodate cognate ligands (29Himanen J.P.

SNEW Binding—The SNEW peptide was readily placed into the electron density after one round of refinement using |Fobs| - |Fcalc|, Φcalc maps (Fig. 3). Similar to the antagonistic TNYL-RAW peptide that binds to the EphB4 receptor, the antagonistic SNEW peptide resides in the ephrin binding cavity otherwise occupied by the long and hydrophobic G–H loop of the ephrin ligand. The SNEW peptide adopts an extended structure with no regular secondary structure elements. The N-terminal end of the peptide binds at the top of the receptor binding cleft, between the J–K and G–H loops. The position of the peptide at the junction of the J–K loop likely results in its ordering. The 12-mer peptide binds across the β-sheet floor formed by strands D and E of the receptor, forming a small network of interactions with residues lining the receptor binding cavity. The C-terminal end of the peptide emerges at the tip of the C–D and E–F loops, forming side chain/main chain interactions with residues in these loop regions. The last amino acid of the peptide, His12, could not be readily modeled into the electron"

We showed previously that BACE1 cleaves β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferase I (ST6Gal I) to initiate its secretion, but it remained unclear how BACE1 affects the cellular level of α2,6-sialylation. Here, we found that BACE1 overexpression in Hep3B cells increased the sialylation of soluble secreted glycoproteins, but did not affect cell-surface sialylation. The sialylation of soluble glycoproteins was not increased by ST6Gal I overexpression alone, but was increased by co-overexpression of ST6Gal I and BACE1 or by expression of the soluble form of ST6Gal I, suggesting that soluble ST6Gal I produced by BACE1 plays, at least in part, a role in the sialylation of soluble glycoproteins. We also found that plasma glycoproteins from BACE1-deficient mice exhibited reduced levels of α2,6-sialylation compared with those from wild-type mice. We propose a novel regulatory mechanism in which cleavage and secretion of ST6Gal I enhance the sialylation of soluble glycoprotein substrates.

Furthermore, BACE1 was shown recently to be required for the processing of neuregulin-1, and BACE1-deficient mice display hypomyelination (18Willem M. Garratt A.N. Novak B. Citron M. Kaufmann S. Rittger A. De Strooper B. Saftig P. Birchmeier C. Haass C. Science. 2006; 314: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). BACE1 is highly expressed in neurons, but its ubiquitous expression at lower levels has also been demonstrated (2Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar). We showed previously that hepatic BACE1 is a major protease for secretion of ST6Gal I into the plasma (8Kitazume S. Nakagawa K. Oka R. Tachida Y. Ogawa K. Luo Y. Citron M. Shitara H. Taya C. Yonekawa H. Paulson J.C. Miyoshi E. Taniguchi N. Hashimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8589-8595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Similar to the case for ST6Gal I, some Golgi-localized glycosyltransferases are cleaved by proteases and subsequently secreted by cells. Indeed, many glycosyltransferases have been found in body fluids such as serum, colostrum, and milk (19Kaplan H.A. Woloski B.M. Hellman M. Jamieson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11505-11509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gerber A.C. Kozdrowski I. Wyss S.R. Berger E.G. Eur. J.

Kohlin T. Thurin J. Blaszczyk-Thurin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15067-15075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, such proteolytic cleavage and secretion into body fluids are affected by various pathological conditions, including malignant transformation and inflammation. Nevertheless, the biological significance of soluble glycosyltransferases has remained unclear (23Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) because the donor substrates (nucleotide sugars) are not available in body fluids. To examine how BACE1 overexpression affects cellular sialylation following ST6Gal I cleavage and secretion, we used several experimental systems. First, we utilized Hep3B hepatoma cells in which BACE1 was overexpressed or its expression was reduced by BACE1 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and quantified the α2,6-sialylation of both secreted and cell-surface glycoproteins. Next, we used a hepatitis rat model, the Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat, in which increased BACE1 expression has been confirmed (8Kitazume S. Nakagawa K. Oka R. Tachida Y. Ogawa K. Luo Y. Citron M.

The LEC rat, a model of Wilson disease, has a deletion in the copper-transporting ATPase gene (ATP7B) (24Yoshida M.C. Masuda R. Sasaki M. Takeichi N. Kobayashi H. Dempo K. Mori M. J. Hered. 1987; 78: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 25Li Y. Togashi Y. Sato S. Emoto T. Kang J.H. Takeichi N. Kobayashi H. Kojima Y. Une Y. Uchino J. J. Clin.

Golgi-localized ATP7B is involved in copper secretion into the plasma, which is coupled with ceruloplasmin synthesis and biliary copper excretion (27Petris M.J. Mercer J.F. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Similar to patients with Wilson disease, LEC rats suffer from toxic accumulation of copper in the liver, leading to the development of hepatitis and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma (28Mori M. Yoshida M.C. Takechi N. Taniguchi N. The LEC Rat: A New Model for Hepatitis and Liver Cancer. Springer-Verlag, Tokyo1991Crossref Google Scholar). Our previous study using LEC rats revealed that the hepatic BACE1 mRNA level is increased before the hepatitis stage and that plasma ST6Gal I increases at the same time (8Kitazume S. Nakagawa K. Oka R. Tachida Y. Ogawa K. Luo Y. Citron M. Shitara H. Taya C. Yonekawa H. Paulson J.C. Miyoshi E. Taniguchi N. Hashimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8589-8595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), thereby suggesting a relationship between altered BACE1 expression and the level of sialylation in vivo. We also analyzed the sialylation of plasma glycoproteins from BACE1-deficient mice. Materials—Male LEC and Wistar rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories Japan Inc. (Yokohama, Japan) and the Shizuoka Agricultural Cooperative Association for Laboratory Animals (Shizuoka, Japan), respectively, and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. Samples from control Long-Evans Agouti (LEA) rats were kindly provided by Dr. Noriyuki Kasai (Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan). BACE1 knock-out mice and their controls (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA) were maintained at Charles River Laboratories, Inc. (Wilmington, MA). The sources of the materials used in this study were as follows: tissue culture media and reagents, including RPMI 1640 medium, from Invitrogen; protein molecular mass standards from Bio-Rad; Sambucus sieboldiana agglutinin (SSA)-biotin and SSA-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan); and all other chemicals from Sigma or Wako Chemicals (Tokyo). Protein concentrations were determined using BCA protein assay reagents (Pierce). The commercially available antibodies used were as follows: rabbit anti-BACE1 polyclonal (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), mouse anti-transferrin monoclonal (Nippon Bio-Test Laboratories Inc., Tokyo), goat anti-transferrin polyclonal (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Irvine, CA), mouse anti-adaptin-γ monoclonal (BD Transduction Laboratories), and mouse anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) monoclonal (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). Anti-ST6Gal I polyclonal antibody E41 (Immuno-Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd., Fujioka, Japan) was used to detect soluble ST6Gal I starting at Glu41 in media. pcDNA-BACE1(D93A)-Myc was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Primer 1 (5′-CTCAACATCCTGGTGGCAACAGGCAACAGGCAGCAGTAAC-3′) and primer 2(5′-GTTACTGCTGCCTGTTGCCACCAGGATGTTGAG-3′) were used to mutate the catalytic Asp93 of BACE1 to Ala. Soluble pSVL-ST6Gal I was constructed by inserting a canine insulin signal sequence-ST6Gal I E41 form-FLAG domain fragment, which was generated by PCR and blunted, into the SmaI site of the pSVL vector (29Colley K.J. Lee E.U. Adler B. Browne J.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17619-17622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). siRNA Transfection—Hep3B cells were plated on 100-mm tissue culture dishes and grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum until they reached 30% confluence. The cells were then transfected with 100 pmol of human BACE1 siRNAs or a control siRNA (AllStars negative control siRNA, Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) using 25 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 1.5 ml of Opti-MEM I. The siRNA duplexes targeted to human BACE1 were as follows: siRNA1, 5′-AGAUCCUGUCCAUUGAUCUCCACCC-3′ and 5′-GGGUGGAGAUCAAUGGACAGGAUCU-3′; and siRNA2, 5′-AAGCTTTGTGGAGATGGTGGA-3′ and 5′-TCCACCATCTCCACAAAGCTT-3′. After 12 h, the medium was exchanged for fresh medium to remove the siRNA duplexes. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were incubated in serum-free Opti-MEM I containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) for 12 h. The cells and media were collected for further analysis. Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from Hep3B cells using Sepasol reagent (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan), and 5 μg of the isolated RNA was reverse-transcribed with random hexamers using a SuperScript III reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For BACE1 and GAPDH primers and probes, we used Assays-on-Demand gene expression products, and the cDNAs were added to TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), which contained all of the reagents for PCR. The probes for BACE1 were labeled with the reporter fluorescent dye FAM™. The cDNAs were amplified by one cycle at 50 °C for 2 min, one cycle at 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 50 °C for 1 min in a total volume of 20 μl using an ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The probes for GAPDH were labeled with VIC® at their 5′-ends and the quencher dye TAMRA™ at their 3′-ends. The expression levels of the target genes were measured in duplicate and normalized to the corresponding GAPDH expression levels. Western Blot Analysis—We examined the levels of transferrin in media from Hep3B cells or rat plasma by Western blot analysis. We also analyzed the levels of intracellular ST6Gal I in Hep3B cell lysates, which were prepared using T-PER buffer (Pierce) containing a protease inhibitor mixture. Cell lysates, plasma, and proteins precipitated from media with acetone were treated with Laemmli sample buffer (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar), separated by SDS-PAGE (5–20% gradient gel), and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with anti-transferrin antibody (1:1000 dilution) or anti-ST6Gal I antibody E41 (1:100 dilution), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit goat or mouse IgG (1:1000 dilution; GE Healthcare) as the secondary antibody. A chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) was used for detection of the bound antibodies (6Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Shirotani K. Saido T.C. Hashimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13554-13559Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). For depletion of transferrin, the media (0.2 ml) of Hep3B cells were treated with anti-transferrin antibody (5 μl) and protein G-agarose (20 μl). After the resin was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the original media and unbound and protein G-agarose-bound fractions were used for further analysis. After detection of intracellular ST6Gal I in the Hep3B cell lysates, the membrane was washed with Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) and incubated with anti-GAPDH antibody. All signals were quantified with a LuminoImage LAS-1000plus analyzer (Fuji, Tokyo). SSA Lectin Blot Analysis—Hep3B cells grown in RPM I 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum were washed with serum-free Opti-MEM I containing EDTA-free Complete protease inhibitor mixture for 12 h. Aliquots (200 μl) of the media were then precipitated with 300 μl of ice-cold acetone. Rat plasma samples (10 μg of protein) or concentrated media derived from Hep3B cells were treated with Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE (5–20% gradient gel), and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Atto Co., Ltd., Tokyo). The membrane was blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2 h and incubated with SSA-biotin (1:100 dilution in 1% bovine serum albumin-containing PBS). After three washes with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS/Tween), the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (1:1000 dilution in 1% bovine serum albumin-containing PBS; Sigma), and the signals were quantified with the LuminoImage analyzer. Isoelectric Focusing—Aliquots (0.5 ml) of media from Hep3B cells grown in Opti-MEM I for 48 h were concentrated and desalted by centrifugation on a Nanosep device (Pall Corp., Ann Arbor, MI). Isoelectric focusing was performed on an Ampholine PAGplate (pH 4.5–6.0; GE Healthcare) to analyze the level of sialylation of transferrin. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and analyzed by immunostaining with anti-transferrin antibody. Standard transferrin and asialotransferrin were prepared by mild acid hydrolysis (25 mm HCl, 80 °C, 1 h) of transferrin and subjected to Coomassie Blue staining (PhastGel Blue R, GE Healthcare). SSA Lectin Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Each well of a 96-well plate (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with a plasma sample (1:40,000 dilution or a series of serial dilutions with PBS) or serial dilutions of α1-acid glycoprotein (up to 6 μg/well) as the standard. After five washes with PBS/Tween, the wells were incubated with 25% Block Ace (Dai Nihon Seiyaku Co., Osaka, Japan) in PBS at 25 °C for 2 h. After washing with PBS/Tween, the wells were sequentially incubated with SSA-biotin (1:1000 dilution in 12.5% Block Ace-containing PBS/Tween) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:1000 dilution in 12.5% Block Ace-containing PBS/Tween) at 25 °C for 1 h each. After extensive washing with PBS/Tween, the wells were incubated with SureBlue TMB microwell peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 n HCl. One unit is defined as the amount of SSA epitopes in 1 μg of α1-acid glycoprotein detected by the assay system. Immunofluorescence Staining—Hep3B cells transfected with rat pcDNA-ST6Gal I were grown for 48 h at 33 °C on poly-l-lysine-coated chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International). After fixation with ice-cold methanol for 15 min at -20 °C, the cells were incubated with anti-ST6Gal I antibody E41 (1:40 dilution) and anti-adaptin-γ antibody (1:50 dilution). After blocking with 5% goat serum in PBS, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:100 dilution) and Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:100 dilution), respectively. After washing with PBS, the samples were mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen) and observed using an Axiovert 100M inverted microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, Germany) equipped with a C-Apochromat (×63, 1.4 numerical aperture) oil immersion objective. Appropriate excitation and barrier filters were used to observe the fluorescence. Flow Cytometry—Hep3B cells were transfected with pcDNA-BACE1, pcDNA-BACE1(D93A), or the empty vector and grown on 100-mm tissue culture plates for 24 h. Next, the cells were detached with 5 mm EDTA in PBS and resuspended as single cell suspensions in fluorescence-activated cell sorter buffer (PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% sodium azide) at 1 × 107 cells/ml. Cells (5 × 105) were incubated with SSA-FITC (10 μg/ml) for 30 min on ice, washed three times, and suspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorter buffer. Flow cytometry data were acquired using an EPICS XL cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA) and analyzed using EXPO32 software (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). BACE1 Expression Enhances the α2,6-Sialylation of Soluble Secreted Proteins—We showed previously that BACE1 cleaves ST6Gal I to initiate its secretion using the following experimental systems: (i) COS or human embryonic kidney 293 cells in culture, (ii) BACE1-deficient and BACE1 transgenic mice, and (iii) in vitro incubations of purified BACE1 with ST6Gal I (6Kitazume S.

Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, it has remained unclear how cellular sialylation is affected by such ST6Gal I cleavage. ST6Gal I is highly expressed in the liver (32Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17872-17878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a significant amount of hepatic ST6Gal I is cleaved and secreted into the plasma, particularly by the so-called acute-phase reaction (19Kaplan H.A. Woloski B.M. Hellman M. Jamieson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11505-11509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Dalziel M. Lemaire S. Ewing J. Kobayashi L. Lau J.T. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1003-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 4S. Kitazume, R. Oka, K. Ogawa, S. Futakawa, Y. Tachida, Y. Hagiwara, H. Takigawa, E. Miyoshi, N. Taniguchi, and Y. Hashimoto, unpublished data. Therefore, we examined how BACE1 overexpression affects the sialylation of soluble glycoproteins and/or cell-surface glycoproteins in Hep3B hepatoma cells. After Hep3B cells were cultured in serum-free media, proteins secreted into the media fractions were concentrated and analyzed by blotting with SSA lectin, which recognizes Siaα2,6Gal epitopes. Even though 20 sialyltransferase genes have been identified to date, ST6Gal I is likely to be the sole enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of Siaα2,6Gal structures in the liver. SSA-reactive signals were observed in the 60-, 70-, and 80-kDa regions on the blot for conditioned media from Hep3B cells (Fig. 1A). Hep3B cells were reported to secrete transferrin (∼80 kDa) into the culture media. In fact, we were able to deplete the 80-kDa signal using anti-transferrin antibody, indicating that the SSA-reactive signal at 80 kDa was derived from transferrin (Fig. 1B). The other signals appeared to be mixtures of α1-chymotrypsin, α1-antitrypsin, and fibrinogen γ-chain based on the available proteomic information (au.expasy.org/). Following BACE1 overexpression, most of the SSA-reactive signal intensities were increased by ∼1.4-fold compared with control experiments. In contrast, expression of the catalytically inactive mutant BACE1(D93A) rather decreased the signal intensities. These results suggest that the proteolytic activity of BACE1 is required for the increase in SSA-reactive epitopes in the media. Next, we examined whether the levels of the core protein portion of transferrin are increased by BACE1 expression. Following BACE1 expression, there were no significant changes in the level of transferrin itself in terms of the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 1), but the SSA-reactive 80-kDa signal was significantly increased. Because Lawrence et al. (34Lawrence C.M. Ray S. Babyonyshev M. Galluser R. Borhani D.W. Harrison S.C. Science. 1999; 286: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) showed previously that the glycosylation sites of transferrin are not involved in transferrin-transferrin receptor interactions, sialylation of transferrin would not affect the endocytosis of transferrin via the transferrin receptor. To obtain direct evidence that the sialylation of transferrin is increased by BACE1 expression, we performed isoelectric focusing. After BACE1 overexpression, transferrin containing more negative charges was significantly increased (Fig. 1C). Our previous study revealed that BACE1 overexpression induces slight changes in cellular α2,6-sialylation in human embryonic kidney cells (6Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Shirotani K. Saido T.C. Hashimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13554-13559Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We also performed similar experiments using other cell lines, such as COS and Chinese hamster ovary, but did not find any changes in their levels of sialylation (data not shown). Following BACE1 overexpression, we clarified that the amount of ST6Gal I mRNA remained unchanged in Hep3B cells (supplemental Fig. 1). Taken together, these results suggest that the effects of BACE1 overexpression are cell type-specific, i.e. the secretion machinery is highly developed in hepatic lineage cells to secrete plasma glycoproteins. We further investigated whether inhibition of BACE1 expression would have the opposite effect on the sialylation of soluble secreted proteins in Hep3B cell media. To achieve this, we used two kinds of BACE1 siRNA duplexes as well as a non-silencing siRNA duplex as a negative control. First, we confirmed that BACE1 siRNA1 and siRNA2 actually knocked down BACE1 expression with efficiencies of 23 and 24%, respectively (Fig. 2A). Next, we sought to determine whether the BACE1 siRNAs also affect the sialylation of transferrin secreted by Hep3B cells. Sialylation of transferrin was found to be reduced to 60 and 54% in siRNA1- and siRNA2-treated cells, respectively (Fig. 2B). Concomitantly, the amounts of SSA epitopes on the glycoproteins secreted by Hep3B cells were reduced by the siRNA treatments (data not shown). The possibilities that the levels of ST6Gal I and transferrin mRNAs may be changed by knockdown of BACE1 expression were ruled out by real-time PCR analysis (supplemental Fig. 2). Taken together, these results indicate that the α2,6-sialylation of soluble glycoproteins is reduced by inhibition of BACE1 expression in Hep3B cells. Next, we examined whether BACE1 expression also affects the sialylation of cell-surface glycoproteins. To achieve this, Hep3B cells expressing BACE1 or BACE1(D93A) or control cells were stained with SSA-FITC, and the cell-surface SSA epitopes were measured by flow cytometry. There were no changes in the levels of surface α2,6-sialylation (Fig. 3). Furthermore, knockdown of BACE1 expression did not alter the level of cell-surface α2,6-sialylation in Hep3B cells (supplemental Fig. 3). We assume that the reason why changes in the level of ST6Gal I expression did not alter the α2,6-sialylation of cell-surface glycoproteins could be that the level of endogenous ST6Gal I is sufficiently high to saturate the cell-surface α2,6-sialylation (35Wen D.X. Svensson E.C. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2512-2518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these r"

Although it is known that multiple transcription factors such as Pax-6, Cdx-2/3, c-Maf, Maf-B, and Brain-4 can activate the glucagon gene promoter through G1, their relative importance in vivo is unknown. We first studied the expression of Maf-B, c-Maf, and Cdx-2/3 in the developing and adult mouse pancreas. Although Maf-B was detectable in a progressively increasing number of α-cells throughout development and in adulthood, c-Maf and Cdx-2/3 were expressed at low and very low levels, respectively. However, c-Maf but not Cdx-2/3 was detectable in adult islets by Western blot analyses. We then demonstrated the in vivo interactions of Pax-6, Cdx-2/3, Maf-B, and c-Maf but not Brain-4 with the glucagon gene promoter in glucagon-producing cells. Although Pax-6, Cdx-2/3, Maf-B, and c-Maf were all able to bind G1 by themselves, we showed that Pax-6 could interact with Maf-B, c-Maf, and Cdx-2/3 and activate transcription of the glucagon gene promoter. Overexpression of dominant negative forms of Cdx-2/3 and Mafs in α-cell lines indicated that Cdx-2/3 and the Maf proteins interact on an overlapping site within G1 and that this binding site is critical in the activation of the glucagon gene promoter. Finally, we show that specific inhibition of Pax-6 and c-Maf but not Cdx-2/3 or Maf-B led to decreases in endogenous glucagon gene expression and that c-Maf binds the glucagon gene promoter in mouse islets. We conclude that Pax-6 and c-Maf interact with G1 to activate basal expression of the glucagon gene.

We and others have proposed Pax-6, Cdx-2/3, large Mafs, Brain-4, and Foxa-2 as potential factors implicated in glucagon gene expression through the transactivation of the G1 element in glucagon-producing cells by transfection studies (8Jin T. Drucker D.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 9Planque N. Leconte L. Coquelle F.M. Benkhelifa S. Martin P. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. Saule S. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 170-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the relevance and relative importance of these factors in vivo is unknown. Pax-6 has previously been reported to be expressed in the endocrine pancreas and during pancreas development as early as embryonic day 10.5 and in the adult (12Turque N. Plaza S. Radvanyi F. Carriere C. Saule S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13St-Onge L. Sosa-Pineda B. Chowdhury K. Mansouri A. Gruss P. Nature. 1997; 387: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Pax-6 is critical for α-cell development and activates glucagon gene promoter constructs through the enhancer element G3 and the α-cell-specific element G1 (4Philippe J. Morel C. Cordier-Bussat M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3039-3045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Pax-6 is essential for the transactivation of glucagon gene promoter constructs in the small and large intestine (14Hill M.E. Asa S.L. Drucker D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1474-1486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, Pax-6 is expressed in all pancreatic endocrine cells and thus cannot explain the specificity of glucagon gene expression. Pax-6 has been shown to interact with Cdx-2/3 and Maf-A, resulting in a synergistic transactivation of the glucagon gene (9Planque N. Leconte L. Coquelle F.M. Benkhelifa S. Martin P. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. Saule S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35751-35760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Ritz-Laser B. Estreicher A. Klages N. Saule S. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4124-4132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that Cdx-2/3 is able to form a heterocomplex with Pax-6 on the G1 element using InR1G9 glucagon-producing cell nuclear extracts and strongly activates gene transcription by transfection assays (15Ritz-Laser B. Estreicher A. Klages N. Saule S. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4124-4132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the expression of Cdx-2/3 in α-cells is not established. Although Cdx-2/3 has been reported to be present in α-cells of the adult mouse pancreas by immunocytochemistry (16Rosanas-Urgell A. Marfany G. Garcia-Fernandez J. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2005; 237: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), it is absent from the adult rat and human α-cells as well as from glucagonomas (10Hussain M.A. Lee J. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 7186-7194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17La Rosa S. Rigoli E. Uccella S. Chiaravalli A.M. Capella C. Virchows Arch. 2004; 445: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Similarly, the expression of the large Mafs in the α-cells is controversial. Although Maf-A is specifically expressed in pancreatic β-cells (18Matsuoka T.A. Zhao L. Artner I. Jarrett H.W. Friedman D. Means A. Stein R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 6049-6062Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 19Kataoka K. Shioda S. Ando K. Sakagami K. Handa H. Yasuda K. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the expression of Maf-B and c-Maf in insulin- and glucagon-producing cells has generated opposing results. It has, indeed, been reported by Artner et al. (20Artner I. Le Lay J. Hang Y. Elghazi L. Schisler J.C. Henderson E. Sosa-Pineda B. Stein R. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) that Maf-B is expressed in mouse α- and β-cells during development but only in α-cells in the adult islets, whereas c-Maf is not expressed at any stage. Others have found that c-Maf but not Maf-B is expressed in α-cells (19Kataoka K. Shioda S. Ando K. Sakagami K. Handa H. Yasuda K. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Functionally, Maf-B- or c-Maf-deficient mice show an important reduction in both insulin- and glucagon-positive cells throughout development, indicating a significant role of Maf-B and c-Maf in differentiation, replication, and/or survival of endocrine precursor cells (21Artner I. Blanchi B. Raum J.C. Guo M. Kaneko T. Cordes S. Sieweke M. Stein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 3853-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 22Nishimura W. Kondo T. Khattabi I. Dodge R. Ho I. Weir S. Sharma A. Diabetes. 2006; 55: A362Google Scholar). Brain-4 and Foxa-1/Foxa-2 have also been shown to activate glucagon gene expression and to be expressed in the α-cells. Brain-4 is specifically expressed in α-cells throughout development and in the adult and has been proposed as a candidate for α-cell specific expression of the glucagon gene (10Hussain M.A. Lee J. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 7186-7194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Heller R.S. Stoffers D.A. Liu A. Schedl A. Crenshaw III, E.B. Madsen O.D. Serup P. Dev. Biol. 2004; 268: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar); however, mutant mice lacking Brain-4 have no developmental and functional defect of the α-cells, raising doubts regarding the relevance of Brain-4 in glucagon gene expression (23Heller R.S. Stoffers D.A. Liu A. Schedl A. Crenshaw III, E.B. Madsen O.D. Serup P. Dev. Biol. 2004; 268: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Foxa-1 and Foxa-2 have been proposed to regulate glucagon gene expression by binding to G1 and G2 of the rat glucagon promoter (11Gauthier B.R. Schwitzgebel V.M. Zaiko M. Mamin A. Ritz-Laser B. Philippe J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 170-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the binding site of Foxa-1 and -2 on G1 is overlapping with Pax-6, and overexpression of these factors in α-cells results in an inhibition of Pax-6-induced expression of the glucagon gene, suggesting an inhibitory role for these factors on G1-mediated transactivation. The aim of this study was to better define and characterize the transcription factors interacting with G1 involved in the α-cell-specific expression of the glucagon gene. We show here by ChIP analyses that Pax-6, Cdx-2/3, Maf-B, and c-Maf interact with the glucagon gene promoter in InR1G9 cells, whereas only Pax-6, Maf-B and c-Maf do in α-TC1 cells, suggesting that neither Cdx-2/3 nor Brain-4 are necessary for glucagon gene expression. Furthermore, whereas both Maf-B and c-Maf are expressed in the islets, Cdx-2/3 mRNA is expressed at very low levels in the embryonic mouse pancreas, and the protein is not detected by either immunocytochemistry or Western blot analyses. Functionally, Pax-6 and c-Maf are the most potent transactivators of the glucagon gene promoter compared with Pax-6/Cdx-2/3 or Pax-6/Maf-B. We show by specifically silencing the expression of c-Maf, Maf-B, and Cdx-2/3 by siRNA 3The abbreviations used are: siRNA, small interfering RNA; BHK, baby hamster kidney; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ChIP, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; RT, reverse transcription; TBP, TATA box-binding protein; en, embryonic day n. 3The abbreviations used are: siRNA, small interfering RNA; BHK, baby hamster kidney; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ChIP, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; RT, reverse transcription; TBP, TATA box-binding protein; en, embryonic day n. that c-Maf seems to be the critical partner of Pax-6 to activate endogenous glucagon gene expression. Finally, we demonstrate that c-Maf interacts with the glucagon gene promoter in adult mouse islets, indicating involvement of c-Maf on glucagon gene transcription in vivo. Cell Culture—The glucagon-producing hamster InR1G9 (24Takaki R. Ono J. Yokogawa Y. Kumae S. Nakamura M. Koyama H. Kawaoi A. Diabetes. 1984; 33: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and mice α-TC1 cells (25Powers A.C. Efrat S. Mojsov S. Spector D. Habener J.F. Hanahan D. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) as well as the non-islet Syrian baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 (R-6504; Sigma) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% newborn calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. RNA Preparation and RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from mouse embryonic and adult pancreas, mouse intestine, α-TC1 and InR1G9 cell lines using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. First strand cDNA synthesis, from 1 μg of total RNA, was performed with random hexamer primers and Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) as recommended by the supplier. cDNA obtained from mouse pancreas and cell lines were analyzed by semi-quantitative PCR using Goldstar (Eurogenetech, Brussels, Belgium) DNA polymerase as recommended by the provider. PCR amplifications were analyzed on ethidium bromide-stained 3% agarose gels. Real time PCRs were performed for glucagon and TBP (TATA box-binding protein) gene expression in glucagon-producing cell lines using QuantiTect SYBR Green kit (Qiagen, Basel, CH) and Light-Cycler (Roche Applied Science). For quantification, a standard curve was systematically generated with four different amounts of purified target cDNA. Each assay was performed in duplicate, and validation of the real time PCR runs was assessed by evaluation of the melting temperature of the products and by the slope and error obtained with the standard curve. The analyses were performed using the Light-Cycler software (Roche Applied Science). The results were corrected by TBP mRNA levels. Mouse Islet Purification—Mouse pancreatic islets were isolated as described previously (26Giordano E. Cirulli V. Bosco D. Rouiller D. Halban P. Meda P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C358-C364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Philippe J. Pacheco I. Meda P. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analyses—Nuclear extracts were isolated as described (28Kumar V. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 55: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 29Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4221-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) from InR1G9 or BHK cells. Ten to thirty μg of each protein extract were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunoblotting was performed with polyclonal antibodies to rabbit Pax-6 diluted 1/1000 (generous gift from S. Saule, CNRS/UMR 146, Institut Curie Section de Recherche, France), Cdx-2/3 diluted 1/500 (kind gift from M. German, University of California), Maf-B (BL658; Bethyl, Montgomery, TX), or c-Maf (BL662; Bethyl) diluted 1/1000 and goat anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated with horseradish peroxidase diluted 1/2000 (sc2030; Santa Cruz, CA). The signal was detected with Super Signal West Pico Trial Kit (Pierce). Protein loading was normalized by immunodetection of rabbit TFIIE-α diluted 1/500 (C17, Santa Cruz). At least three independent experiments were performed with nuclear cell extracts. c-Maf detection was performed with or without c-Maf blocking peptide (BP300-613; Bethyl). 5 μg of c-Maf blocking peptide was preincubated for 2 h at room temperature with 1 μg of specific c-Maf antibody (BL662). Coimmunoprecipitation and Western Blot—α-TC1 cells were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Subsequent to a 15-min incubation on ice, the cells were lysed by the addition of 10% Nonidet P-40, and intact nuclei were sedimented by centrifugation. Buffer C containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and complemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete mini; Roche Applied Science) was added to the pellet and incubated for 1 h. Nuclear proteins were purified from membrane debris by centrifugation. Approximately 800 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a mouse anti-Pax-6 (MAB1260, R & D Systems, Abingdon, UK) coupled to sheep α-mouse IgG magnetic Dynabeads® (Invitrogen). The beads were then washed extensively with Buffer C and resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli buffer. 10-50 μg of total nuclear extracts (input) and 20 μl of the 50 μl of immunoprecipitate were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred on to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were incubated with either α-rabbit Pax-6 (S. Saule) or anti-rabbit Maf-B (BL 658) and c-Maf (BL 662) and subsequently with sheep α-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Signals were detected using a Super Signal West Pico trial kit (Pierce). Immunohistochemistry—Cryosections of adult or embryonic mouse pancreas fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde were treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 and immunolabeled using polyclonal goat glucagon antibody (N-17; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) combined with polyclonal rabbit Maf-B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, LabForce, Nunningen, Switzerland, P-20) and Cdx-2/3 (M. German) antibodies. glucagon, Maf-B and Cdx-2/3 immunostaining were performed with confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope; Carl Zeiss AG, Göttingen, Germany). The percentage of colocalization of glucagon and Maf-B were calculated with the Metamorph software version 6.2r4 (Universal Imaging, Puchheim, Germany). The percentages were determined on at least 100 (e12.5, e14.5, and e17.5) to 500 glucagon-positive cells (adult) in four to five distinct pancreas sections corresponding to at least three different animals. Transient Transfection Assays—For all applications, BHK-21 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique (30Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 54: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) as previously described (15Ritz-Laser B. Estreicher A. Klages N. Saule S. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4124-4132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). InR1G9 and α-TC1 cell lines were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method (30Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 54: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 31Drucker D.J. Philippe J. Jepeal L. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15659-15665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for glucagon promoter studies. cDNAs encoding the dominant negative forms of Maf-A (DN-MafA) and Cdx-2/3 (DN-Cdx2/3) were transfected in InR1G9 and α-TC1 cells using the Transfectin Reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Promoter Analysis—glucagon promoter transactivation was studied after transfection of -292 to +50 base pair sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the rat glucagon promoter (-292Glu-CAT) in BHK-21, InR1G9, and α-TC1 cell lines. glucagon promoter activities were analyzed by chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) activity as previously described (32Philippe J. Missotten M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1465-1469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were cotransfected with either a plasmid containing the human placental alkaline phosphatase gene (pSV2A-PAP) or the luciferase gene (RSV-Luc; Promega, Wallisellen, Switzerland), driven by the simian virus 40 early promoter, to monitor transfection efficiency. Quantification of acetylated and nonacetylated forms was done with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Placental alkaline phosphatase and luciferase activities were measured by spectrophotometry and luminometry (Labsystem), respectively. A minimum of three independent transfections were performed, each of them carried out in duplicate. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—EMSAs were performed using the -100 to -49 sequence of the 5′-flanking region of rat glucagon promoter corresponding to the G1 element (5′-CAAAACCCCATTATTTACAGAT GAGAAATTTATATTGTCAGCGTAATATCT-3′) and nuclear extracts from BHK-21 cells overexpressing either mouse Pax-6 (p46) (subcloned in the laboratory), hamster Cdx-2/3 (kindly provided by Dr. M. German (University of California, San Francisco, CA)), mouse Maf-B, or mouse c-Maf full-length proteins (generous gift by Dr. R. Stein (Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TE)), respectively. EMSA reactions contained 20 mmol/liter Hepes, pH 7.9, 5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 0.5 mmol/liter EDTA, 50 mmol/liter KCl, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 6.25% glycerol, 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of salmon sperm DNA, and 2 μg of poly(dIdc-dIdC) as described previously (5Cordier-Bussat M. Morel C. Philippe J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 3904-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with nuclear protein extracts (15-25 μg of proteins) and ∼50 000 cpm of 5′-end 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. Anti-Pax-6 (serum 13) and anti-Cdx-2/3 antibodies were generously provided by Drs. S. Saule (CNRS/UMR 146, France) and M. German (University of California, San Francisco), respectively. Anti-Maf-B (BL658) and anti-c-Maf (BL662) antibodies were purchased at Bethyl (Bethyl Laboratories Inc., Montgomery, TX). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay (ChIP)—ChIP assays were performed according to Orlando et al. (33Orlando V. Strutt H. Paro R. Methods. 1997; 11: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Briefly, formaldehyde-cross-linked chromatin extracts were prepared from InR1G9 and α-TC1 cells and fragmented by enzymatic digestion (Enzymatic shearing kit; Active Motif Europe, Belgium). 50 μg (InR1G9 and α-TC1 cells) or 20 μg (adult mouse islets) of chromatin extract were first precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads (CL-4B; Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden) for 1 h. After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 8 μg of anti-Pax-6 (serum 13), anti-Maf-B (BL658, Bethyl), anti-c-Maf (BL662, Bethyl), anti-Cdx-2/3 (M. German, University of California, San Francisco), anti-Brain-4 (J. F. Habener, Harvard University, Boston, MA), and α-acetyl-histone H4 antibodies (06-866; Upstate, Lake Placid, NY), as well as rabbit IgG (sc-2027; Santa Cruz). The immunoprecipitated DNA-protein complexes were bound to protein A-Sepharose beads after 3 h of incubation at 4 °C and washed in a low salt buffer, high salt buffer, LiCl buffer, and Tris-EDTA buffer in succession as described by Duong et al. (34Duong D.T. Waltner-Law M.E. Sears R. Sealy L. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32234-32242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Proteins were eliminated using proteinase K (200 μg; Applichem) in the presence of 10% SDS by overnight incubation at 37 °C. After phenol extraction, the DNA was precipitated, suspended in water, and used as a template for PCR. The set of PCR primers used for analysis of binding on the glucagon gene proximal promoter (corresponding to G4-G1 box) in InR1G9 cells were 5′-GACTAGGCTCATTTGACGTC-3′ and 5′-ATGGAAAGGGCAGTTTGGAG-3′; the two set of primers used for α-TC1 cells and mouse adult islets were 5′-CAAAGCGAGTGGGTGAGTG-3′ and 5′-GCCACGCAGATATTACGCTG-3′ and equally 5′-CAGCGTAAAAAGCAGATGAGC-3′ and 5′-AGGCTGTTTAGCCTTGCAGAT-3′. PCR products were verified on ethidium bromide-stained 3% agarose gels and analyzed by real time PCR using a Light-Cycler (Roche Applied Science). RNA Interference—Two different specific sequences of siRNA were designed by Qiagen for Cdx-2/3 and Stealth siRNA by Invitrogen for Maf-B, c-Maf, and Pax-6 against hamster mRNA sequences. Appropriate scrambles were obtained at the same time (percentage of GC content identical to Pax-6, Maf-B, c-Maf, and Cdx-2/3 siRNA). InR1G9 cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected with 100 nm of siRNA using 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as recommended by the supplier. The transfections were performed twice sequentially. Total RNA and nuclear extract were isolated 48 h after transfection as described above under “Experimental Procedures.” Data Analysis—The data are presented as the means ± S.E. and analyzed by Student's t test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Specific expression of the glucagon gene in rat pancreas requires the presence of the G1 element, which contains putative binding sites for Pax-6, Cdx-2/3, Mafs, and Brain-4 (Fig. 1). Because the expression of Pax-6 and Brain-4 in α-cells has been clearly documented during pancreas development and adulthood (10Hussain M.A. Lee J. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 7186-7194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13St-Onge L. Sosa-Pineda B. Chowdhury K. Mansouri A. Gruss P. Nature. 1997; 387: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 23Heller R.S. Stoffers D.A. Liu A. Schedl A. Crenshaw III, E.B. Madsen O.D. Serup P. Dev. Biol. 2004; 268: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we studied the expression of Cdx-2/3, Maf-B, and c-Maf, which have all been proposed to activate glucagon gene transcription along with Pax-6. We first examined the expression of Cdx-2/3, Maf-B, and c-Maf at different stages of pancreatic development (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2A, Maf-B and c-Maf mRNAs can be detected from at least embryonic day 12.5 (e12.5) until the adult stage. At all stages, Maf-B mRNA levels are much higher compared with those of c-Maf. The Maf-B/c-Maf mRNA ratio increases during development to reach ∼10 in the adult. Large Mafs mRNAs are also present in the hamster and mouse glucagon-producing cell lines InR1G9 and α-TC1, respectively. By contrast, Cdx-2/3 mRNA was hardly detected from total mouse pancreas during development and in the adult islets, although Southern blots of the RT-PCR samples using a specific Cdx-2/3 cDNA probe revealed the presence of Cdx-2/3 mRNA at all the different developmental stages (data not shown). However, we found substantial Cdx-2/3 mRNA levels in InR1G9 cells but not in α-TC1 cells. We then performed immunohistochemistry on mouse pancreas sections prepared at e12.5, e14.5, and e17.5 and in the adult (Fig. 2B). We could not detect Cdx-2/3 at any stage of development, nor in the adult, whereas it was present in the adult mouse intestine, used as a positive control. Cdx-2/3 was not detected either by Western blot of adult islet nuclear extracts, whereas it was present in InR1G9 cells (data not shown). We also assessed for the presence of the transcription factor Maf-B in glucagon-positive cells (Fig. 2B). Maf-B is present as soon as e12.5 and can be detected until the adult stage. At e12.5, only ∼10% of the glucagon-positive cells expressed Maf-B. This percentage increased progressively until the adult stage to 88% (Fig. 2B). To detect c-Maf, we also used two antibodies (M-153 and BL662); the BL662 antibody was raised against mouse c-Maf and reported to be specific, whereas M-153 was not specific because it could also detect both Maf-B and Maf-A proteins (data not shown and Ref. 19Kataoka K. Shioda S. Ando K. Sakagami K. Handa H. Yasuda K. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, we could not detect c-Maf in pancreas sections using the specific BL662 antibody as reported by others (18Matsuoka T.A. Zhao L. Artner I. Jarrett H.W. Friedman D. Means A. Stein R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 6049-6062Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 20Artner I. Le Lay J. Hang Y. Elghazi L. Schisler J.C. Henderson E. Sosa-Pineda B. Stein R. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To further evaluate the presence of c-Maf and Maf-B in α-cells, we performed Western blots of α-cell lines and adult mouse islet protein extracts; both Mafs were detected in α-TC1 cells and adult islets, whereas only Maf-B was found in InR1G9 cells (Fig. 2, C and D). We hypothesize that the BL662 antibody raised against mouse c-Maf is not able to recognize hamster c-Maf by Western blots. Overall, our results indicate that Cdx-2/3 is not required and may be dispensable for glucagon gene expression because i"
https://openalex.org/W2118757106,"In immune-induced inflammation, leukocytes are key mediators of tissue damage. Since A(2A) adenosine receptors (A(2A)Rs) are endogenous suppressors of inflammation, we examined cellular and molecular mechanisms of kidney damage to determine if selective activation of A(2A)R would suppress inflammation in a rat model of glomerulonephritis. Activation of A(2A)R reduced the degree of kidney injury in both the acute inflammatory phase and the progressive phase of glomerulonephritis. This protection against acute and chronic inflammation was associated with suppression of the glomerular expression of the MDC/CCL22 chemokine and down-regulation of MIP-1alpha/CCL3, RANTES/CCL5, MIP-1beta/CCL4, and MCP-1/CCL2 chemokines. The expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines, interluekin (IL)-4 and IL-10, also increased. The mechanism for these anti-inflammatory responses to the A(2A)R agonist was suppression of macrophages function. A(2A)R expression was increased in macrophages, macrophage-derived chemokines were reduced in response to the A(2A)R agonist, and chemokines not expressed in macrophages did not respond to A(2A)R activation. Thus, activation of the A(2A)R on macrophages inhibits immune-associated inflammation. In glomerulonephritis, A(2A)R activation modulates inflammation and tissue damage even in the progressive phase of glomerulonephritis. Accordingly, pharmacological activation of A(2A)R could be developed into a novel treatment for glomerulonephritis and other macrophage-related inflammatory diseases."

Strains lacking one of these components display slow growth, cold sensitivity, and defects in translational fidelity. Ssz1 diverges from canonical Hsp70s insofar that neither the ability to hydrolyze ATP nor binding to peptide substrates is essential in vivo. The exact role within the chaperone triad and whether or not Ssz1 can hydrolyze ATP has remained unclear. We now find that Ssz1 is not an ATPase in vitro, and even its ability to bind ATP is dispensable in vivo. Furthermore, Ssz1 function was independent of ribosome-associated complex formation, indicating that Ssz1 is not merely a structural scaffold for Zuo1. Finally, Ssz1 function in vivo was inactivated when both nucleotide binding and Zuo1 interaction via the C-terminal domain were disrupted in the same mutant. The two domains of this protein thus cooperate in a way that allows for severe interference in either but not in both of them.

Chaperones of the Hsp70 family usually consist of an ∼45-kDa N-terminal ATPase, an ∼15-kDa peptide binding, and an ∼10-kDa variable C-terminal domain (1Mayer M.P. Bukau B. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). The function of classical Hsp70 homologs is based on the interaction of the peptide binding domain with hydrophobic patches of polypeptide substrates. Substrate binding and release are regulated via the ATPase cycle of the N-terminal domain. In the case of classical Hsp70s, ATPase activity can be regulated by a diverse set of co-chaperones, which are essential for Hsp70 functions (1Mayer M.P. Bukau B. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). The best characterized class of Hsp70 co-chaperones is the heterogeneous J-domain protein family (2Hennessy F. Nicoll W.S. Zimmermann R. Cheetham M.E. Blatch G.L. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1697-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). J-domain proteins, also known as Hsp40s, contain a signature motif of ∼70 amino acids, termed the J-domain, which stimulates the rate of ATP hydrolysis by Hsp70s. To that end, a J-domain transiently interacts with the ATPase domain of its specific Hsp70 partner (1Mayer M.P. Bukau B. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar, 3Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar, 4Walsh P.

Two Hsp70 family members (Ssb1/2 3Ssb1/2 represents Ssb1 and Ssb2, two 99% identical proteins with identical function and similar expression levels (39Craig E.A. Jacobsen K. Mol. Cell.

Oellerer S. Rospert S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7809-7816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The three chaperones are genetically linked and form a functional triad. Lack of SSZ1, ZUO1, or SSB1/2 results in slow growth, cold sensitivity, and pronounced hypersensitivity against aminoglycosides such as paromomycin (6Gautschi M. Mun A. Ross S. Rospert S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4209-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 7Hundley H. Eisenman H. Walter W. Evans T. Hotokezaka Y. Wiedmann M. Craig E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ssz1 and Zuo1 assemble into a stable heterodimeric complex termed ribosome-associated complex (RAC), 4The abbreviations used are: RAC, ribosome-associated complex consisting of Ssz1 and Zuo1; BN-PAGE, blue native PAGE; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. 4The abbreviations used are: RAC, ribosome-associated complex consisting of Ssz1 and Zuo1; BN-PAGE, blue native PAGE; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. which is anchored to the ribosome via its Zuo1 subunit (8Gautschi M. Lilie H. Fünfschilling U. Mun A. Ross S. Lithgow T. Rücknagel P. Rospert S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3762-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Complex formation between a ribosome-bound J-domain protein and a particular Hsp70 homolog is not unique to yeast. Recently, we found that in mammalian cells, Hsp70L1 stably interacts with the Zuo1 homolog MPP11 and forms the mammalian RAC (9Otto H. Conz C. Maier P. Wölfle T. Suzuki C.K. Jenö P. Rücknagel P. Stahl J. Rospert S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10064-10069Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Yeast RAC acts as a co-chaperone and stimulates ATP hydrolysis by Ssb1/2. The function requires both RAC subunits and a functional J-domain in Zuo1 (10Huang P. Gautschi M. Walter W. Rospert S. Craig E.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although the interaction between Ssb1/2 and the J-domain of Zuo1 resembles that of classical Hsp70/J-domain partners, the role of Ssz1 in the system has remained obscure. At first, Ssz1 contains an unusually short peptide binding domain and lacks the variable C-terminal domain (8Gautschi M. Lilie H. Fünfschilling U. Mun A. Ross S. Lithgow T. Rücknagel P. Rospert S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3762-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In fact, the function of Ssz1 does not strictly depend on substrate binding as a truncated version lacking nearly the entire peptide binding domain was reported to support growth as efficiently as the wild type protein (7Hundley H. Eisenman H. Walter W. Evans T. Hotokezaka Y. Wiedmann M. Craig E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4203-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Moreover, Ssz1 also contains a particular ATPase domain. Within the nucleotide binding pocket of wild type Ssz1, a number of important residues diverge from canonical Hsp70s (10Huang P. Gautschi M. Walter W. Rospert S. Craig E.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Whether Ssz1 can hydrolyze ATP at all has not been conclusively decided. Preparations of authentic RAC displayed ATPase activity, but interfering contaminations could not be excluded. On the other hand, RAC purified via a His tag on Zuo1 did not hydrolyze ATP but might have been functionally disturbed (10Huang P. Gautschi M. Walter W. Rospert S. Craig E.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11Raviol H. Bukau B. Mayer M.P. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 12Amor-Mahjoub M. Suppini J.P. Gomez-Vrielyunck N. Ladjimi M. J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2006; 844: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The difficulty in tackling this basic question is due to the fact that Hsp70s in general display low ATP turnover rates, which are experimentally difficult to distinguish even from marginal contaminations with active ATPases (1Mayer M.P. Bukau B. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). One possibility to avoid this problem is to analyze the effect of mutations that have been shown to eliminate ATP hydrolysis in other Hsp70s. For instance, mutations in the ATPase domain of Ssz1 were found to fully complement the phenotype of a Δssz1 strain, indicating that ATP hydrolysis was not an essential function of Ssz1 in vivo (10Huang P. Gautschi M. Walter W. Rospert S. Craig E.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, whether or not an Hsp70 can hydrolyze ATP cannot be decided solely based on in vivo studies. On this note, it recently became evident that the ATPase activity of some Hsp70s is dispensable in vivo. For example, yeast Sse1 is capable of ATP hydrolysis in vitro, but its function does not depend on this activity in vivo (13Shaner L. Trott A. Goeckeler J.L. Brodsky J.L. Morano K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21992-22001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14Raviol H. Sadlish H. Rodriguez F. Mayer M.P. Bukau B.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2519-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Here we set out to better understand the role of the noncanonical Hsp70 homolog Ssz1. To this end, we have generated a set of mutations in Ssz1 that enabled us to comparatively analyze in vivo and in vitro the roles of ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, and the peptide binding domain. Furthermore, we have analyzed how Ssb1 acts as a multicopy suppressor in a Δssz1 strain with respect to these properties (6Gautschi M. Mun A. Ross S. Rospert S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4209-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The combined data suggest that the role of Ssz1 in the chaperone triad is robust. Loss of the Ssz1 peptide binding domain, stable interaction with its partner subunit Zuo1, and ATP binding were well tolerated, displaying only minor reduction of its in vivo activity. Our data also resolve the issue of the ATPase activity and demonstrate that Ssz1 contained in purified RAC does not hydrolyze ATP. Only when Ssz1 lacks its peptide binding domain and at the same time is deficient in nucleotide binding does it appear completely non-functional. We find that Ssz1 is involved in two separable processes, one related to translational fidelity and the other to general growth defects. Ssb1 substitutes for the role in translational fidelity by a mechanism that does not require ATP hydrolysis. However, with respect to slow growth and cold sensitivity, Ssb1 is unable to replace Ssz1. Yeast Strains, Media, and Culture Conditions—Standard yeast genetic techniques were applied (16Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics, A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). MH272-3f a/α (ura3/ura3, leu2/leu2, his3/his3, trp1/trp1, ade2/ade2) is the parental wild type strain of all haploid derivatives used in this study (17Heitmann J. Movva N.R. Hiestand P.C. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1948-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Deletion strains lacking SSZ1 (Ida2: Δssz1), ZUO1 (Ida1: Δzuo1), or both genes (Ida12: Δzuo1Δssz1) have been previously described (8Gautschi M. Lilie H. Fünfschilling U. Mun A. Ross S. Lithgow T. Rücknagel P. Rospert S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3762-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To generate the Δssb1Δssb2 strain, the ClaI/AgeI 1.4-kb fragment contained with the coding region of SSB1 as well as SSB2 were replaced by the ADE2 marker. Single disruptions were generated in the haploid a and α strains. The resulting strain ssb1::ADE2 was transformed with a plasmid containing the URA3 marker, and the ssb2::ADE2 strain was transformed with a plasmid containing the TRP1 marker; after mating, a diploid ssb1::ADE2 ssb2::ADE2 strain that had lost the plasmids was selected and subsequently sporulated. ssb1::ADE2 ssb2::ADE2 haploid strains (Ida56E) were generated after dissection of the spores by tetrad analysis. Deletion of both copies of Ssb was also confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown). Strains were grown to log phase on 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose (YPD) or in glucose-containing minimal medium. Growth defects were analyzed by spotting 10-fold serial dilutions containing the same number of cells to YPD plates. Plates were supplemented with paromomycin at the concentration specified in the legends of Figs. 3, 4, 5. Plates were incubated at 30 °C to analyze the slow growth phenotype and at 20 °C to determine cold sensitivity.FIGURE 4The peptide binding domain of Ssz1 is required for stable complex formation with Zuo1. Ssz1, Ssz1-ΔC, and Ssz1-LKA were expressed from low copy number plasmids, and Ssz1-LKA-ΔC was expressed from a 2μ high copy number plasmid (supplemental Fig. 1). A, the cellular concentration of Zuo1 is reduced when Ssz1 lacks its C-terminal domain. Normalized total cell extracts obtained from wild type (wt), Δssz1-, or Δssz1-expressing Ssz1-ΔC were run on SDS-PAGE and were subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting using α-Zuo1 and α-Rpl17 as loading control. B, Ssz1-ΔC does not stably interact with Zuo1. Extracts were run on BN-PAGE and were analyzed by immunoblotting using α-Zuo1. C, Ssz1-ΔC does not bind to ribosomes. Cytosol (C) obtained from wild type and Δssz1-expressing Ssz1-ΔC was separated into a postribosomal supernatant (S) and a ribosomal pellet (P) in the presence of either 120 mm (low salt) or 700 mm (high salt) potassium acetate. Aliquots were separated on SDS-PAGE and were subsequently analyzed by immunodecoration using α-Zuo1, α-Ssz1, and α-Rpl16 (ribosomal marker). A minor fraction of Ssz1-ΔC detected in the low salt ribosomal fraction was also detected after high salt treatment, suggesting that it most likely represented aggregates co-sedimenting with ribosomes upon high speed centrifugation. D, Ssz1-ΔC fully complements slow growth and cold sensitivity of Δssz1 but is only partly functional on paromomycin-containing medium. Haploid yeast strains were grown in minimal medium to early log phase and were subsequently grown on solid medium as described in the legend for Fig. 3. YPD plates contained 400 μg/ml paromomycin (paro 30 °C) or 200 μg/ml paromomycin (20 °C). E, Ssz1-LKA-ΔC fails to complement defects of Δssz1 under all growth conditions tested. Strains were grown and analyzed as in D. YPD contained 100 μg/ml paromomycin when indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5An Ssb1-Ssz1 chimera partly restores growth defects of a Δssz1 strain. A, Ssb1-Ssz1 does not form a stable complex with Zuo1. Cell lysates prepared from wild type, Δssz1 expressing Ssb1-Ssz1, or Δssz1 expressing Ssb1*-Ssz1 were subjected to native immunoprecipitation reactions using α-Zuo1-coated protein A-Sepharose beads (Ab). Beads coated with preimmune serum (PI) were used as a control. Aliquots of the total lysate (T), unbound material (U), and material recovered on the beads (B) were separated on SDS-PAGE and were analyzed by immunoblotting. B, cell lysates as described in A were run on BN-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Immunoblots in A and B were decorated with α-Zuo1 and α-Ssz1 as indicted and were developed with 125I-protein A. wt, wild type. C, Ssb1-Ssz1 partly complements growth defects of Δssz1 but fails to complement Δssb1Δssb2. Haploid yeast strains were grown in minimal medium to early log phase at 30 °C. Serial 10-fold dilutions were spotted onto YPD plates or YPD plates containing 50 μg/ml paromomycin (paro). Plates were incubated for 3 days at 30 °C or for 5 days at 20 °C, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mutant Versions of Ssz1 for Expression in Yeast and Escherichia coli—For a summary of the mutants used in this study, compare Fig. 1. For expression in yeast, mutant versions of SSZ1, SSB1, and chimera were generated by PCR and were transferred into the centromeric yeast expression vector pYCPlac33 (URA3) (6Gautschi M. Mun A. Ross S. Rospert S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4209-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 18Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar). Mutant Ssz1-R71A has been described (10Huang P. Gautschi M. Walter W. Rospert S. Craig E.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In Ssz1-LKA, three consecutive amino acids, G201L, I202K, and R203A, were exchanged. Ssz1-ΔC is a C-terminally truncated version of Ssz1 (1–394). Ssz1-LKA-ΔC corresponds to Ssz1-ΔC, but in addition, contains G201L, I202K, and R203A. Ssb1-ΔC is a C-terminally truncated version of Ssb1 (1–391). The Ssb1-Ssz1 chimera was generated by fusing the ATPase domain of Ssb1 (1–391) in-frame to the peptide binding domain of Ssz1 (396–538). Ssb1*-Ssz1 contains K73A within the ATPase domain of Ssb1, which abolishes ATPase activity (19O'Brien M.C. Flaherty K.M. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15874-15878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Ssz1-ΔC and Ssb1-ΔC correspond to the ATPase domain fragment of Hsc70 (amino acids 1–386), of which the structure was solved by x-ray crystallography (20Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). All mutant versions of Ssz1 and Ssb1 were verified by sequencing. Expression levels were analyzed by immunoblotting (supplemental Fig. 1). To ensure comparable cellular concentrations of the RAC subunits, we have overexpressed Zuo1 in Δssz1 + Ssb1-Ssz1 and Δssz1 + Ssb1*-Ssz1 strains from the 2μ, ADE2 marker plasmid pYEPlac555-zuo1. To purify RAC and RAC-LKA for in vitro experiments, Ssz1 or Ssz1-LKA and Zuo1 were co-expressed in E. coli. With the exception of the LKA mutation, Ssz1 was identical to the authentic yeast protein, and Zuo1 contained a single amino acid exchange (F2H). Neither Ssz1 nor Zuo1 contained tags. Ssz1 and Ssz1-LKA were expressed from pET28N, a derivative of pET28a (Novagen), and Zuo1 was expressed from pETcoco-2 (Novagen). Analysis of Protein Complexes and Ribosome Association—For the preparation of total cell extracts, 50-ml mid-log cultures grown on YPD were harvested, washed with 10 ml of double distilled H2O, and subsequently treated with 1 volume of acid-washed glass beads and 2 volumes of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 120 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mix (1.25 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.75 μg/ml antipain, 0.25 μg/ml chymostatin, 0.25 μg/ml elastinal, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A dissolved in Me2SO)). Cells were disrupted by six 1-min cycles of vortexing followed by cooling on ice and cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 20,000 × g. Aliquots of the resulting extracts were analyzed either by BN-PAGE using 6–16.5% gradient gels at 4 °C as described previously (9Otto H. Conz C. Maier P. Wölfle T. Suzuki C.K. Jenö P. Rücknagel P. Stahl J. Rospert S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10064-10069Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) or by immunoprecipitations under native conditions using α-Zuo1- or α-FLAG (Sigma)-coated agarose beads as indicated in the legends for Figs. 4 and 5 (5Raue U. Oellerer S. Rospert S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7809-7816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21Rospert S. Hallberg R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). An aliquot corresponding to the material applied to each immunoprecipitation reaction was precipitated with a final concentration 5% trichloroacetic acid and was analyzed in parallel. Preparation of cytosol and ribosome binding assays were performed as described previously (8Gautschi M. Lilie H. Fünfschilling U. Mun A. Ross S. Lithgow T. Rücknagel P. Rospert S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3762-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Protein Purification—E. coli cells were disrupted by sonication in buffer A (40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 240 mm potassium acetate, 0.014% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Crude extracts were cleared by three successive centrifugation steps for 30 min at 12,000 × g, 20 min at 30,000 × g, and 10 min at 36,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was loaded onto a 16-ml ResourceQ column (GE Healthcare) (250–800 mm, 60-ml linear potassium acetate gradient in 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4). RAC eluted at a concentration of 440–540 mm potassium acetate. RAC-containing fractions were pooled, adjusted to a concentration of 200 mm potassium acetate, and loaded onto a MonoQ HR10/10 (GE Healthcare) column (200–1000 mm, 50-ml linear potassium acetate gradient in 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4). RAC-containing fractions (750–840 mm potassium acetate) were adjusted to a final concentration of 100 mm potassium acetate and were loaded onto a MonoS HR5/5 (GE Healthcare) column (100–1000-mm, 18-ml linear potassium acetate gradient in 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4). During this final purification procedure, RAC eluted at a potassium acetate concentration of 240–400 mm. RAC-R71A and RAC-QPD were purified from yeast as described previously (8Gautschi M. Lilie H. Fünfschilling U. Mun A. Ross S. Lithgow T. Rücknagel P. Rospert S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3762-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Purified RAC preparations were concentrated to ∼2 mg/ml, supplemented with 10% glycerol, and stored at –80 °C. DnaK and DnaJ were purified according to established protocols (22Buchberger A. Schroder H. Buttner M. Valencia A. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 23Schönfeld H.J. Schmidt D. Zulauf M. Prog. Colloid Polym. Sci. 1995; 99: 7-10Crossref Google Scholar). ATPase Assays—ATPase activities of RAC and DnaK were determined in single turnover as well as steady-state experiments. ATP hydrolysis was monitored by thin layer chromatography. Single-turnover assays were performed basically as described (24Mayer M.P. Laufen T. Paal K. McCarty J.S. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In brief, RAC was incubated in the presence of ATP for 5 min at 25 °C, and DnaK·ATP complexes were formed for 2 min on ice. A 50-μl reaction contained 8.2 μm DnaK or RAC, 25 μm ATP, 0.82 MBq of [α-32P]ATP in buffer B (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 120 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate). Protein·ATP complexes were rapidly separated from free nucleotide by gel filtration on a nick column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer B. Single-drop fractions were collected, and the radioactivity was monitored with a Geiger-Müller counter (Mini Instruments Ltd., Mini 900). The first four fractions containing [α-32P]ATP were pooled, and aliquots of 19 μl were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. For the assay, an aliquot was quickly thawed at 30 °C, 1 μl was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-celluloseF TLC plate (Merck) for the zero value, and 32 μl of prewarmed buffer B (containing 1 μm DnaJ when indicated) was added. At the indicated times, 2-μl aliquots of the reaction mix were spotted onto TLC plates, which were subsequently developed in 3.6% (v/v) acetic acid, 400 mm LiCl. Quantification of the amounts of ADP and ATP was performed using the AIDA software (raytest), and the data were fitted to a single-exponential decay function (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software). Steady-state ATPase assays were carried out at 25 °C in a volume of 50 μl. The reactions contained 50 μm ATP, 0.037 MBq of [α-32P]ATP, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 120 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate. The rate of ATP hydrolysis at steady-state was calculated by linear fitting of the data. Photocross-linking of [α-32P]8-N3-ATP to Ssz1—Photocross-linking experiments were performed as described with minor modifications (10Huang P. Gautschi M. Walter W. Rospert S. Craig E.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Twenty-μl reactions containing 1 μm of the purified RAC preparations were incubated in buffer C (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 120 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate) supplemented with 4 μm [α-32P]8-N3-ATP (MP Biomedicals) and incubated for 5 min at 25 °C. After isolation of the preformed protein·ATP complexes (∼40 μl) via rapid gel filtration, cross-linking was performed by irradiation of the samples with UV light (254 nm, UV hand lamp NU-8 KL, Roth). Reactions were quenched by the addition of 4 μl of 100 mm dithiothreitol and were separated on 10% Tris/Tricine gels. Protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, and 8-N3-ATP was detected by autoradiography of the dried gels. To compare the efficiency of ATP binding to the different mutant RAC complexes, the α-32P signal was normalized with respect to the amount of protein contained in the same band as determined by densitometry. Miscellaneous—Total yeast protein for immunoblot analysis was prepared by the method of Yaffe and Schatz (25Yaffe M.P. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; : 4819-4823Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Sigma). Immunoblots were developed using ECL or 125I-labeled protein A (26Haid A. Suissa M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Quantification of immunoblots was performed with AIDA Image Analyzer software (raytest). Untagged RAC Purified from E. coli Does Not Hydrolyze ATP—In most cases, objective evidence for ATP hydrolysis by an Hsp70 is based on the ability of specific co-chaperones to stimulate this reaction that occurs at an intrinsically low rate. If such a co-chaperone has not been identified, analysis depends on highly purified protein preparations. To obtain highly purified, authentic RAC, we have co-expressed untagged versions of Ssz1 and Zuo1 (Fig. 1) in E. coli and have purified the resulting complex via a series of conventional column chromatographic steps (Fig. 2A). First, we analyzed the ATPase activity of RAC under steady-state conditions using E. coli DnaK as a positive control. Consistent with published data (28McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), DnaK hydrolyzed ATP at a rate of 1 × 10–3 s–1. This rate was stimulated 7-fold in the presence of DnaJ. In contrast, the determined rate of RAC (7.5 × 10–5 s–1) was in the same order of magnitude as that of purified DnaJ, which served as a non-ATPase control (Fig. 2B). It is therefore most likely that the measured ATPase activity of RAC originated from small contaminations of co-purified ATPases from the E. coli cytosol. In steady-state assays, even small contaminations with high ATPase rates can contribute significantly to the observed hydrolysis rate since the observed velocity of the hydrolysis reaction is proportional to the product of kcat and concentration of the contaminating ATPase. To circumvent this problem, we performed single-turnover ATPase experiments with isolated RAC·ATP complexes. Under these conditions, any contaminating ATPase would contribute to the observed rate and amplitude of ATP hydrolysis according to its relative amount, which is negligible when highly purified proteins are used (Fig. 2A). RAC formed stable [α-32P]ATP complexes, which could be isolated via rapid gel filtration (data not shown). However, upon incubation at 25 °C, bound ATP was not hydrolyzed (Fig. 2C). ATP Binding Has No Effect on the in Vivo Function of Ssz1—Previous analysis of a large set of mutants suggested that neither nucleotide binding nor hydrolysis was critical for the function of Ssz1 in vivo (10Huang P. Gautschi M. Walter W. Rospert S. Craig E.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, the extent to which ATP binding was affected in mutant Ssz1 versions had not been assessed directly. To interfere with ATP binding, we have introduced three consecutive mutations (G201L, I202K, and R203A, Fig. 1) within the nucleotide binding pocket of Ssz1. The residues are located within a region homologous to a loop of Hsc70 required for the accommodation of the β- and γ-phosphate groups of bound nucleotides (20Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C.

https://openalex.org/W2052131745,"The blue and green fluorescent proteins (BFP and GFP) have been fused at the N- and C-terminal ends, respectively, of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (PMCA) isoform 4xb (hPMCA4xb). The fusion protein was successfully expressed in yeast and purified by calmodulin affinity chromatography. Despite the presence of the fused autofluorescent proteins BFP-PMCA-GFP performed similarly to the wild-type enzyme with respect to Ca2+-ATPase activity and sensitivity to calmodulin activation. In the autoinhibited state BFP-PMCA-GFP exhibited a significant intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) consistent with the location of the fluorophores at an average distance of 45A. The FRET intensity in BFP-PMCA-GFP decreased when the enzyme was activated either by Ca2+-calmodulin, partial proteolysis, or acidic lipids. Moreover, FRET decreased and became insensitive to calmodulin when hPMCA4xb was activated by mutation D170N in BFP-PMCA(D170N)-GFP. The results suggest that the ends of the PMCA are in close proximity in the autoinhibited conformation, and they separate or reorient when the PMCA achieves its final activated conformation."

Several attempts were made to identify downstream molecules necessary for IQ-induced Golgi membrane vesiculation. Using a reconstitution assay system, protein kinase D (PKD) was identified as a key enzyme responsible for IQ-induced Golgi membrane vesiculation (2Liljedahl M. Maeda Y. Colanzi A. Ayala I.

However, the exact mechanism underlying IQ-induced Golgi apparatus breakdown, especially a relationship between PKD and lipid remodeling, remains unclear. Membrane trafficking is energetically unfavorable and does not occur spontaneously in vivo, but occurs under strict control of specialized proteins. Evidence is accumulating that these proteins do not act alone but in concert with particular membrane lipids such as phosphoinositides (3Cremona O. De Camilli P. J.

Phospholipase activity not only has a profound impact on the structure and stability of cellular membranes but also plays a pivotal role in regulating many critical cellular functions. Phospholipase D (PLD) generates PA, a multifunctional lipid that has been proposed variously to alter membrane curvature, to serve as a protein attachment site, to activate selected enzymes, or to represent the starting material for the production of additional signaling lipids, particularly in the context of membrane vesicle trafficking and cytoskeletal dynamics (8Cross M.J.

In this work, we found that IQ causes robust activation of PLD in various cell types. The purpose of this study was to clarify the roles of PLD-catalyzed formation of PA in IQ-induced Golgi apparatus fragmentation. We provide evidence that the generation of PA catalyzed by PLD and the subsequent conversion of PA to DAG catalyzed by PA phosphohydrolase are prerequisites for both PKD activation and IQ-induced Golgi membrane vesiculation.

DT40 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. ts045 Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Glycoprotein (VSVG) Transport Assay—The expression plasmid for temperature-sensitive (ts045) vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) was kindly donated by Dr. J. Lippincott-Schwartz (National Institutes of Health). HeLa cells were grown in 35-mm glass-bottomed dishes (Matsunami Glass Industries, Ltd., Osaka) and transfected with plasmid encoding VSVG-GFP protein using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, cells were maintained at 37 °C for 36 h, transferred to 40 °C for 2 h, and then transferred to 20 °C for 30 min. At the end of the 30-min incubation at 20 °C, VSVG-GFP protein was concentrated mainly in the Golgi. These cells were incubated further at 20 °C in medium containing 30 μm IQ and monitored by fluorescence microscopy. Construction of PLD-deficient DT40 Cells—Chicken spleen cDNA and genomic DNA libraries were obtained from Clontech. The chicken cDNA library was screened using the human PLD1 cDNA. Several chicken cDNA isolates were sequenced to confirm the identification. The genomic library was screened using the chicken PLD1 cDNA. After subcloning the genomic clone of chicken PLD1, the targeting construct was made as described previously (13Buerstedde J.M. Takeda S. Cell. 1991; 67: 179-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), and the results are shown in supplemental Fig. 1. For pPLD-neo or pPLD-hisD, the neo cassette (2 kilobase pairs) or hisD cassette (3 kilobase pairs) was introduced into the BamHI site in the exon 19 genomic sequence. pPLD-neo was linearized and transfected into DT40 cells by electroporation (550 V, 25 microfarads). Twenty-four h after DNA transfection, 2 mg/ml G418 was added to the culture medium, and cells were selected for 14 days. Genomic DNAs were isolated from several G418-resistant clones, digested with EcoRI, and hybridized with the chicken PLD genomic DNA fragment. Immunofluorescence Staining of DT40 Cells—DT40 cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverglasses were stimulated with 30 μm IQ for 2 h at 37°C. The cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 m glycine, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. After incubation with anti-GOSR1 monoclonal antibody followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes), the bound antibody was detected with a fluorescence microscope. Small Interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for Human PLD1 and PLD2—siRNAs for human PLD1 site 1 (siRNA-1, 5′-GUU AAG AGG AAA UUC AAG CTT-3′ and 5′-GCU UGA AUU UCC UCU UAA CTT-3′) and site 2 (siRNA-2, 5′-GGU CCA UCC GUA GUU UAC AGA-3′ and 5′-UGU AAA CUA CGG AUG GAC CCG-3′) and human PLD2 (5′-GAC ACA AAG UCU UGA UGA GTT-3′ and 5′-CUC AUC AAG ACU UUG UGU CTT-3′) and the control siRNA (5′-UUC UCC GAA CGU GUC ACG UdTdT-3′ and 5′-ACG UGA CAC GUU CGG AGA AdTdT-3′) were synthesized at Japan Bio Services (Saitama, Japan). HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative Real-time PCR for Human PLD1 and PLD2—Total RNA was isolated from siRNA-treated HeLa cells using the NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel, Duven, Germany). cDNA synthesis was performed with 1 μg of total RNA using murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) priming with random hexamers. Quantitative PCR was performed by applying the real-time SYBR Green PCR technology with the use of an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The human PLD1- and PLD2-specific primers were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems), and their sequences were as follows: human PLD1, 5′-GGA AAT CGT TGG AGG TTG GA-3′ and 5′-TGT AGA CGC ATC AAA GTC CTC TTG-3′; and human PLD2, 5′-GCC AGC ACT TCC TCT ACA TTG A-3′ and 5′-CAA AAG CAC GTA GAC TCG GTA A-3′. The primer sequences for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were 5′-GCC ATC AAT GAC CCC TTC ATT-3′ and 5′-TCT CGC TCC TGG AAG ATG G-3′. The amplification reaction was performed with SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan), and the thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 10 s at 95 °C, 40 cycles for 5 s at 95 °C and 31 s at 60 °C. The expression of PLD1 and PLD2 mRNAs was normalized to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. Purification of Recombinant Proteins—COS-7 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged PLD1, influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged PKD1, or HA-tagged constitutively active PKD1. Three days after transfection, recombinant proteins were purified using either anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science) or anti-FLAG antibody M2 beads (Sigma) and finally eluted with HA or FLAG peptide (Sigma), respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocol. PLD Assay in Intact Cells—NRK or HeLa cells were suspended at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml and cultured for 1 day. Twenty-four h later, cells were incubated for 12 h at 37 °C with [14C]oleic acid (0.1 μCi/5 × 105 cells). The labeled cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, transferred to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% 1-butanol, and then stimulated either with IQ or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). The cells were incubated for an additional 60 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by changing the medium to extraction buffer containing methanol, KCl, and EGTA. Phase separation, lipid extraction, and separation were carried out as described previously (14Nakamura S. Shimooku K. Akisue T. Jinnai H. Hitomi T. Kiyohara Y. Ogino C. Yoshida K. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12319-12322Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). PLD activity is expressed as a percentage of the radioactive [14C]phosphatidylbutanol in the total radioactivity found in all spots in a particular lane. In Vitro PLD Assay—The effect of either recombinant PKD (200 ng) or protein kinase Cα (PKCα; 200 ng) on ARF1 (ADP-ribosylation factor-1; 100 ng; a kind gift from Dr. R. A. Kahn, Emory University, Atlanta, GA)-supported PLD activity in the absence or presence of 100 nm PMA was determined by measuring the formation of [14C]phosphatidylbutanol from [14C]phosphatidylcholine in the presence of 0.5% 1-butanol as described previously (15Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). PKD Assay in Semi-intact Cells—Evaluation of PKD activation was performed by measurement of syntide-2 phosphorylation. NRK or HeLa cells were treated with digitonin (30 μg/ml) in KHM buffer (125 mm potassium acetate, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), and 2.5 mm magnesium acetate), and then the PKD substrate syntide-2 was added (0.2 μg/ml). The cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C after stimulation with IQ (30 μm) and addition of [γ-32P]ATP (100 μm, 0.1 μCi). The proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation, the supernatant was spotted onto phosphocellulose P-81 paper. After washing the paper with 75 mm H3PO4, the radioactivity incorporated into peptides was determined by Cerenkov counting. Inhibition of IQ-induced Golgi Membrane Fragmentation by 1-Butanol—Because PLD is involved in various steps of membrane vesicle trafficking, we assumed that PLD may be involved in IQ-induced Golgi vesiculation processes. To test this possibility, the effects of 1-butanol, which is known to inhibit PLD-mediated processes by facilitating the PLD-specific transphosphatidylation reaction at the expense of PA production, on IQ-induced Golgi vesiculation were studied. The ts045 temperature-sensitive mutant of VSVG fused to GFP (16Presley J.F. Cole N.B. Schroer T.A. Hirschberg K. Zaal K.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nature. 1997; 389: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) was utilized to study vesicular trafficking from the Golgi. ts045 VSVG is reversibly misfolded and retained in the ER at the restrictive temperature (40 °C) and is able to exit the ER and traffic to the plasma membrane following incubation at the permissive temperature (32 °C). However, if the cells are shifted directly from the restrictive temperature to 20 °C, ts045 VSVG is transported from the ER and subsequently arrested in Golgi/trans-Golgi network (TGN) compartments. HeLa cells transiently expressing ts045 VSVG-GFP were incubated at 40 °C for 2 h and then at 20 °C for 30 min. The VSVG-GFP transport from the Golgi/TGN was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy after IQ treatment. IQ caused a rapid breakdown of the stacked VSVG-GFP protein in the Golgi into small vesicles (Fig. 1), consistent with a previous report (1Takizawa P.A. Yucel J.K. Veit B. Faulkner D.J. Deerinck T. Soto G. Ellisman M. Malhotra V. Cell. 1993; 73: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). When 0.5% 1-butanol was present in the culture medium, IQ-induced Golgi vesiculation was almost completely blocked. However, the same concentration of 2-butanol was far less effective, suggesting that the 1-butanol effect was specifically PLD-mediated and not a cytotoxic effect. These results indicate the involvement of PLD activity in IQ-induced Golgi vesiculation. IQ Activation of PLD in an Intact Cell System—Because 1-butanol, a specific inhibitor of PLD hydrolytic activity, blocked IQ-induced Golgi vesiculation, we supposed that IQ treatment may have an effect on PLD activity. To address this issue, we measured PLD activity in an intact cell system after IQ treatment. For this experiment, we used HeLa and NRK cells, which are known to undergo IQ-dependent Golgi membrane fragmentation. Cells were metabolically labeled with radioactive oleic acid and assayed for phosphatidylbutanol production after IQ treatment in the presence of 1-butanol. In both cell lines, PLD was strongly activated by IQ in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). The extent of PLD activation by 30 μm IQ was greater than that obtained by PMA, a well known potent PLD activator. On the other hand, PLD activity was unchanged upon addition of IQ when measured in a cell-free system (data not shown). These findings strengthen our hypothesis that PLD is a downstream signaling molecule of IQ and that its product (PA) functions as a regulator of IQ-mediated Golgi vesiculation. PLD1 Is Responsible for IQ-induced Golgi Vesiculation—To identify the PLD isoform that is activated by IQ, the expression of each isoform was down-regulated by isoform-specific siRNA, and PLD activity was measured and compared with that in control siRNA-transfected cells after IQ treatment. First, the effect of siRNA was evaluated by quantification of mRNA for each PLD isoform in HeLa cells by quantitative real-time PCR. Two different site-specific PLD1 siRNAs, siRNA-1 and siRNA-2, inhibited the PLD1 mRNA by 66 and 71%, respectively, compared with the control siRNA (Fig. 3A). Similarly, PLD2 siRNA transfection caused 81% inhibition of PLD2 mRNA (Fig. 3B). Using these siRNA systems, transfection of either PLD1 siRNA-1 or siRNA-2 but not PLD2 siRNA almost completely abolished the ability of IQ to activate PLD (Fig. 3C), suggesting the involvement of PLD1 in these processes. In comparison, PMA-induced PLD activation was only mildly attenuated in PLD1 siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 3, C and D), suggesting that IQ caused more selective activation of PLD1, whereas PMA caused relatively nonselective activation of the PLD isoforms. Inhibition of IQ-induced Golgi Membrane Vesiculation in DT40-PLD–/– Cells—We next tried to examine the effect of PLD knockdown by siRNA on IQ-induced Golgi vesiculation. However, we failed to observe accumulation of VSVG-GFP at the Golgi when the temperature was shifted from 40 to 20 °C presumably because of the toxic effect of Lipofectamine 2000 used for siRNA transfection (data not shown). Instead, we tried to obtain more direct evidence to show the importance of PLD in IQ-induced Golgi vesiculation using PLD knock-out cells. DT40 chicken B lymphocytes were used to prepare gene knockout cells because DT40 cells are known to incorporate foreign DNA by targeted integration at frequencies similar to those for random integration (13Buerstedde J.M. Takeda S. Cell. 1991; 67: 179-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 17Takeda S. Masteller E.L. Thompson C.B. Buerstedde J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4023-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Data base searches suggested that DT40 cells contain only one PLD isoenzyme that is close to mammalian PLD1 with 88% homology. Using gene targeting techniques, we generated homozygous DT40 mutants, DT40-PLD–/–, devoid of two alleles of the PLD gene. Treatment of wild-type DT40 cells with IQ caused a robust disintegration of the Golgi (Fig. 4A), as seen in HeLa cells (Fig. 1). In contrast, DT40-PLD–/– cells became resistant to IQ treatment. Golgi morphology showed that 70% of the DT40-PLD–/– cells remained resistant (stack shape) to IQ treatment (Fig. 4B, PLD-knockout white bar), whereas 80% of the wild-type cells were sensitive (disperse shape) to IQ treatment (Control black bar). Together with the effect of 1-butanol (Fig. 1), these results indicate that PLD activity is essential for the IQ-induced change in Golgi morphology. PKD Activation Is Secondary to PLD Activation—One of the downstream targets of IQ has been reported to be PKD (2Liljedahl M. Maeda Y. Colanzi A. Ayala I. Van Lint J. Malhotra V. Cell. 2001; 104: 409-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). To assess the molecular events leading to the activation of PLD and PKD and any causal relationship between these enzymatic activities and Golgi morphological changes, we first examined the possibility that PKD activation may cause the subsequent activation of PLD1.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of PKD on PLD activity in a purified system. HA-tagged PKD1 and FLAG-tagged PLD1 expressed in COS-7 cells were separately purified by their respective antibody-conjugated beads and reconstituted for PLD assay. Reconstitution with either wild-type or constitutively active PKD1 had little or no effect on both basal and PMA-stimulated PLD activities compared with the control empty vector-expressing (mock) cells (Fig. 5). In contrast, reconstitution with PKCα caused a 2-fold increase in both basal and PMA-stimulated PLD activities, consistent with previous reports (18Conricode K.M. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7199-7202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Jiang X. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol.

Similarly, the expression of wild-type or constitutively active PKD1 had little or no effect on PLD activity as measured in an intact cell system (Fig. 5). These results suggest that PLD activation may not be secondary to PKD activation. Conversely, we studied the effect of PLD stimulation on PKD activity. PKD activity was assessed by measuring the phosphorylation of syntide-2, an authentic peptide substrate for PKD, in digitonin-permeabilized NRK cells. IQ treatment caused stimulation of syntide-2 phosphorylation (Fig. 6), as suggested previously (23Jamora C. Yamanouye N. Van Lint J. Laudenslager J. Vandenheede J.R. Faulkner D.J. Malhotra V. Cell. 1999; 98: 59-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Notably, this IQ-induced syntide-2 phosphorylation was specifically abrogated by 1-butanol but not by the same concentration of 2-butanol, suggesting that IQ-induced PLD activation is a prerequisite for the subsequent stimulation of PKD.FIGURE 6Requirement of PLD-catalyzed PA formation for IQ-induced PKD activation. After permeabilization of NRK cells with 30 μm digitonin, the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in KHM buffer containing the PKD substrate syntide-2 and [γ-32P] ATP in the absence or presence of 30 μm IQ, 0.5% 1-butanol (1-But.), or 0.5% 2-butanol (2-But.). PKD activation was assessed by measuring the phosphorylation of syntide-2. IQ-induced syntide-2 phosphorylation was calculated by subtracting each value from that obtained in the absence of IQ.

Exton J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To test whether this mechanism of PKD activation is true for IQ-induced phenomena, we tested the effect of propranolol, an inhibitor of PA phosphohydrolase, on IQ-induced PKD stimulation. As expected, IQ-induced PKD activation was nearly completely inhibited by propranolol (Fig. 7A). The effect of propranolol on IQ-induced Golgi membrane fragmentation was studied next. VSVG-GFP transiently expressed in HeLa cells was first accumulated in the Golgi by incubation at restrictive temperature (40 °C) for 2 h and then at 20 °C for 30 min as in Fig. 1. Cells were treated with IQ in the absence or presence of propranolol, and the dynamics of VSVG-GFP were monitored by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. In contrast to the complete vesiculation of the Golgi throughout the cytoplasm (control), VSVG-GFP remained in a stacked form at the perinuclear regions in IQ-treated HeLa cells when the cells were pretreated with propranolol (Fig. 7, B and C). These results indicate that PA phosphohydrolase-catalyzed conversion of PA to DAG is necessary for both PKD activation and IQ-induced Golgi membrane fragmentation. We have demonstrated that IQ induces PLD activation in various cell lines, including HeLa cells (Fig. 2). The importance of PLD in IQ-induced Golgi fragmentation was demonstrated by several findings, i.e. IQ-induced Golgi fragmentation was specifically inhibited by 1-butanol (Fig. 1), and PLD knock-out DT40 cells were resistant to IQ for Golgi fragmentation (Fig. 4). We have also provided evidence that PKD activation is secondary to PLD activation, as supported by the observation that PKD activation after IQ treatment was almost completely blocked by either 1-butanol (Fig. 6) or propranolol (Fig. 7) treatment. It has been suggested previously that IQ is able to activate one or more heterotrimeric G-proteins located on the Golgi (25Jamora C. Takizawa P.A. Zaarour R.F. Denesvre C. Faulkner D.J. Malhotra V. Cell. 1997; 91: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The activated G-protein dissociates into Gα and Gβγ subunits, where the latter remains membrane-associated and causes the fragmentation of the Golgi through downstream mediators. Gβγ was further shown to activate PKD, and activated PKD was shown to mediate fragmentation of the Golgi (23Jamora C. Yamanouye N. Van Lint J. Laudenslager J. Vandenheede J.R. Faulkner D.J. Malhotra V. Cell. 1999; 98: 59-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Gβγ subunits are considered to act directly upon PKD by associating with the pleckstrin homology domain and somehow bringing about PKD activation (23Jamora C. Yamanouye N. Van Lint J. Laudenslager J. Vandenheede J.R. Faulkner D.J. Malhotra V. Cell. 1999; 98: 59-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Diaz Anel and Malhotra (26Diaz Anel A.M. Malhotra V. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) have shown recently that the expression of Gβ1γ2 or Gβ3γ2 in cells induces Golgi fragmentation. Notably, this results in the phosphorylation of PKD in its activation loop, and the level of PKD activation loop phosphorylation correlates with the extent of Golgi fragmentation. They identified the kinase responsible for PKD phosphorylation as PKCη. Indeed, the expression of constitutively active PKCη results in Golgi fragmentation, and this effect is blocked by coexpression of kinase-dead PKD, again consistent with the idea that PKCη-mediated phosphorylation of PKD regulates Golgi carrier formation. They also surmised that DAG production plays an important role in the activation of PKCη during Gβγ subunit-induced Golgi fragmentation, although the exact mechanism of DAG production remains unclear. Our present results, including IQ-induced PLD activation and inhibition of IQ-induced PKD activation by either 1-butanol or propranolol, strongly suggest that the production of DAG from phosphatidylcholine through sequential actions of PLD and PA phosphohydrolase is a possible mechanism of the lipid production leading to subsequent PKD activation. The involvement of the Gβγ subunit in IQ-induced PLD activation remains to be clarified. The PLD-catalyzed production of PA may have at least two physiological roles in IQ-induced Golgi fragmentation, i.e. PA is known to facilitate membrane bending and the formation of the highly curved intermediates (27Kooijman E.E. Chupin V. de Kruijff B. Burger K.N.J. Traffic. 2003; 4: 162-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). PA is also converted to DAG via enzymatic dephosphorylation by PA phosphohydrolase. In addition to a signaling role of DAG, i.e. activation of PKCη as mentioned above, DAG has a central role in the constriction of Golgi membrane tubules stemming from the unique molecular shape of DAG characterized by an extremely large negative spontaneous curvature. PKD and lipid components such as PA and DAG may work in concert but in spatiotemporally different manners to cause Golgi membrane curvature and constriction and the formation of transport carriers. For example, when HeLa cells were transiently transfected with both catalytically inactive PKD1 and VSVG-GFP, VSVG-GFP, which accumulated in the ER at the nonpermissive temperature (40 °C), was transported to the Golgi at 20 °C at a speed similar to those cells expressing VSVG-GFP alone (data not shown). This suggests that PKD has little or no effect on vesicular transport from the ER to the Golgi. On the other hand, when the cells were shifted to the permissive temperature (32 °C), VSVG-GFP trafficked to the plasma membrane in empty vector-transfected (control) cells, whereas VSVG-GFP traffic from the Golgi/TGN to the plasma membrane was blocked and resulted in tubulation of the Golgi in catalytically inactive PKD1-expressing cells (supplemental Fig. 2). This is consistent with a previous report (2Liljedahl M. Maeda Y. Colanzi A. Ayala I. Van Lint J. Malhotra V. Cell. 2001; 104: 409-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and suggests that this mutant acted dominant-negatively to suppress endogenous PKD-mediated signaling and that PKD was involved in the regulation of vesicular trafficking from the TGN to the plasma membranes. Interestingly, treatment of the cells with IQ, where the Golgi became tubulated by the expression of catalytically inactive PKD1, led to VSVG-GFP trafficking to the plasma membrane (supplemental Fig. 2). These results suggest that IQ-induced PLD activation may overcome the dominant-negative effects of catalytically inactive PKD1 on the Golgi trafficking. On the other hand, the expression of catalytically inactive PLD1 in HeLa cells resulted in the slow trafficking of VSVG-GFP from the Golgi to the plasma membranes (supplemental Fig. 3). It has been reported that PLD is involved in vesicular trafficking from the ER to the Golgi complex (28Bi K. Roth M.G. Ktistakis N.T. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 301-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Our present results indicate that PLD is also involved in the regulation of membrane trafficking from the Golgi complex to the plasma membranes. In addition, when VSVG-GFP and constitutively active PKD were coexpressed in HeLa cells, VSVG-GFP accumulated at the Golgi/TGN upon a temperature shift from the restrictive temperature (40 °C) to 20 °C as in Fig. 1, remained stacked at the perinuclear regions, and did not undergo fragmentation as seen upon IQ treatment. This suggests that the activation of PKD alone is insufficient for the Golgi complex breakdown (data not shown). In conclusion, PA and DAG are widely involved in the regulation of vesicular trafficking by effectively reducing the energy barriers to fission and fusion, whereas protein factors such as PKD play more specialized roles, e.g. the constriction stage of vesicle formation during vesicular transport from the TGN to the plasma membrane (29Ponnambalam S. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2003; 20: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The concerted actions of lipid factors such as PA and DAG and protein factors such as PKD are needed for regulated vesicular trafficking. Download .zip (.0 MB) Help with zip files"

https://openalex.org/W2160665958,"Src family kinases are suppressed by a “tail bite” mechanism, in which the binding of a phosphorylated tyrosine in the C terminus of the protein to the Src homology (SH) 2 domain in the N-terminal half of the protein forces the catalytic domain into an inactive conformation stabilized by an additional SH3 interaction. In addition to this intramolecular suppressive function, the SH2 domain also mediates intermolecular interactions, which are crucial for T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling. To better understand the relative importance of these two opposite functions of the SH2 domain of the Src family kinase Lck in TCR signaling, we created three mutants of Lck in which the intramolecular binding of the C terminus to the SH2 domain was strengthened. The mutants differed from wild-type Lck only in one to three amino acid residues following the negative regulatory tyrosine 505, which was normally phosphorylated by Csk and dephosphorylated by CD45 in the mutants. In the Lck-negative JCaM1 cell line, the Lck mutants had a much reduced ability to transduce signals from the TCR in a manner that directly correlated with SH2-Tyr(P)505 affinity. The mutant with the strongest tail bite was completely unable to support any ZAP-70 phosphorylation, mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, or downstream gene activation in response to TCR ligation, whereas other mutants had intermediate abilities. Lipid raft targeting was not affected. We conclude that Lck is regulated by a weak tail bite to allow for its activation and service in TCR signaling, perhaps through a competitive SH2 engagement mechanism.

Abraham R.T. Rudd C.E. Alonso A. Merlo J.J. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 918-969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism by which Lck is induced to carry out this phosphorylation upon TCR ligation has remained unclear.Several mechanisms for TCR to Lck communication have been proposed, including mechanisms based on CD4/CD8 association (3Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunol. Today. 1989; 10: 189-193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), lipid raft-based concentration, and CD45-mediated dephosphorylation. However, none of these models can satisfactorily explain more than some of the existing data. There are many examples of TCR signaling without any participation of CD4 or CD8 (4Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 6Haughn L. Gratton S. Caron L. Sekaly R.P. Veillette A. Julius M. Nature. 1992; 358: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Perhaps the most striking case is the Jurkat T cell leukemia line, in which the TCR machinery is remarkably efficient in the absence of CD4 or CD8 (4Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Although this tumor cell line overexpresses Lck and lacks several protein tyrosine phosphatases, it still requires TCR ligation for Lck to phosphorylate ITAMs and other substrates and for initiation of the signaling cascades that characterize T cell activation (5Mustelin T. Abraham R.T. Rudd C.E. Alonso A. Merlo J.J. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 918-969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lck-mediated TCR signaling also occurs in untransformed CD4-8 T cells (6Haughn L. Gratton S. Caron L. Sekaly R.P. Veillette A. Julius M. Nature. 1992; 358: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and T cells lacking these coreceptors can be activated by TCR stimulation in vitro. However, in vivo CD4 or CD8 are required because the affinity of the TCR for its ligand often is too low for a productive interaction of T cells with antigen-presenting cells. The association of Lck with these coreceptors may assist Lck function as well, but it is nevertheless clear that a mechanism must exist for the transmission of a signal from the TCR to Lck without the need for CD4 or CD8. Similarly, the TCR can activate the related kinase Fyn to carry out a set of phosphorylation events that are at least partly different (7Denny M.F. Patai B. Straus D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1426-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Fyn is also activated by an unknown molecular mechanism.Lipid rafts play an important role as platforms for the assembly of signaling complexes, and much of Lck and Fyn is found in these dynamic structures. However, because the TCR is not raft-associated in resting T cells, and TCR ligation does not change the association of Lck and Fyn with rafts, it is difficult to imagine a mechanism by which TCR to Lck/Fyn communication would be mediated by rafts. Rather, rafts appear to provide the optimal environment for tyrosine phosphorylation of many Lck and Fyn substrates once these kinases have been activated. The role of CD45 is discussed under “Results” and “Discussion.”Once phosphorylated by Lck, the ITAM motifs serve to recruit a second type of cytoplasmic PTK, ZAP-70 (8Chan A.C. Iwashima M. Turck C.W. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 71: 649-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 9Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S.C. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), which is subsequently activated by direct phosphorylation at Tyr493 in its activation loop by Lck (10Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G.H. Wang T. Thoma R. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Up to ten ZAP-70 molecules may cluster on each fully phosphorylated TCR complex. Once activated by Lck, these bound ZAP-70 molecules autophosphorylate, presumably in trans, and thereby create docking sites for SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins (11Neumeister E.N. Zhu Y. Richard S. Terhorst C. Chan A.C. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3171-3178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ZAP-70 also directly phosphorylates a small set of proteins, including the adapter protein LAT (12Zhang W.J. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar), the dual-specific phosphatase VHR (13Alonso A. Rahmouni S. Williams S. van Stipdonk M. Jaroszewski L. Godzik A. Abraham R.T. Schoenberger S.P. Mustelin T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and perhaps the adapter protein SLP-76 (14Wardenburg J.B. Fu C. Jackman J.K. Flotow H. Wilkinson S.E. Williams D.H. Johnson R. Kong G. Chan A.C. Findell P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19641-19644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar).The Src family PTKs are also responsible for the recruitment and activation of another class of cytoplasmic PTKs, the Tec-related kinases Itk/Emt and Txk/Rlk (15Gibson S. August A. Branch D. Dupont B. Mills G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7079-7083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 16Heyeck S.D. Wilcox H.M. Bunnell S.C. Berg L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25401-25408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), which are involved in phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase Cγ1 (17Liu K.Q. Bunnell S.C. Gurniak C.B. Berg L.J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1721-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 18Perez-Villar J.J. Kanner S.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6435-6441PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to ITAMs, ZAP-70, and Itk, Src family PTKs have numerous other substrates, including cytoskeletal proteins, regulators of small GTPases, phosphatases, and other signaling molecules, some of which may be independent of ITAM phosphorylation.Given the central role of Src family PTKs, particularly Lck, in T cell activation, it is not surprising that these kinases are tightly regulated at all levels from transcription and translation (19Marth J.D. Overell R.W. Meier K.E. Krebs E.G. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1998; 332: 171-173Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar) to multiple post-translational modifications and controlled subcellular location. Perhaps the best studied regulation is the phosphorylation of an inhibitory tyrosine in the C terminus of Lck, Tyr505 (reviewed in Refs. 3Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunol. Today. 1989; 10: 189-193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar and 20Mustelin, T. (1994) Src Family Tyrosine Kinases in Leukocytes, pp. 1-155, R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TXGoogle Scholar). Mutation of this residue results in a constitutively active form of Lck, which can transform fibroblasts (21Amrein K.E. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1988; 8: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In T cells, Tyr505 is phosphorylated by the Csk PTK (23Bergman M. Mustelin T. Oetken C. Partanen J. Flint N.A. Amrein K.E. Autero M. Burn P. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2919-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and dephosphorylated by the CD45 phosphatase (24Mustelin T. Coggeshall K.M. Altman A. Proc. Natl.

It has been estimated that ∼50% of Tyr505 is phosphorylated under physiological conditions in resting T cells (27Sefton B.M. Oncogene. 1990; 6: 683-686Google Scholar), with a relatively modest turnover (T½ = ∼45 min (28Oetken C. von Willebrand M. Marie-Cardine A. Pessa-Morikawa T. Ståhls A. Fischer S. Mustelin T. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)). In agreement with the notion that the balance between CD45 and Csk is important (29Mustelin T. Burn P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 215-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), most CD45-negative T cells fail to respond to TCR stimulation (30Pingel J.T. Thomas M.L.

Today. 1988; 9: 195-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), correlates with increased sensitivity to TCR ligation.

In addition, a physiological mechanism for immunosuppression by cAMP-inducing stimuli involves a 3-fold activation of Csk through cAMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Csk at Ser364 (35Vang T. Sundvold V. Levy F.O. Skålhegg B.S. Hansson V. Mustelin T. Tasken K. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar).At the structural level, the phosphorylation of Src family PTKs at their negative regulatory tyrosine (Tyr505 in Lck) promotes the transition of the kinase into an inactive conformation, in which the phosphorylated tyrosine binds the SH2 domain, whereas the adjacent SH3 domain associates with a linker sequence between the SH2 and kinase domain (38Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). These two interactions force the catalytic domain into an inactive state, in which catalytic residues are displaced from their optimal configuration and the flexible activation loop collapses into the catalytic center of the enzyme to block substrate access.In addition to this essential role in suppression of the kinase, the SH2 domain of Lck is also required for Lck participation in TCR signaling. Significantly, a Lck mutant with a nonfunctional SH2 domain had an elevated catalytic activity but was unable to phosphorylate cellular proteins in response to TCR triggering (39Caron L. Abraham N. Pawson T. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2720-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 40Couture C. Songyang Z. Jascur T. Williams S. Tailor P. Cantley L.C. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24880-24884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Lck is recruited through its SH2 domain and/or that Lck needs to interact with downstream targets via the SH2 domain. A number of SH2 domain ligands for Lck have been reported, including ZAP-70 (41Duplay P. Thome M. Hervé F. Acuto O. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 42Pelosi M. Di Bartolo V. Mounier V. Mege D. Pascussi J.M. Dufour E. Blondel A. Acuto O. J. Biol.

Post N.H. Chan E. King P.D. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1425-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and phospholipase Cγ1 (45Weber J.R. Bell G.M. Han M.Y. Pawson T. Imboden J.B. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), but none of these can satisfactorily explain the need for the SH2 domain for the earliest tyrosine phosphorylation events triggered by the TCR, i.e. ITAM phosphorylation.Here, we decided to skew the balance between these two opposite functions of the Lck SH2 domain in TCR signaling by strengthening the binding of Tyr(P)505 to the SH2 domain. To this end, we created three mutants of Lck in which one to three amino acid residues following Tyr505 were mutated to amino acids preferred by the SH2 domain. We report that the resulting sequences indeed had better affinity for the SH2 domain and that the mutations strongly affected the ability of Lck to transduce signals from the TCR.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Reagents—The anti-Tyr(P) mAb 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and the anti-hemagglutinin epitope mAb 12CA5 was from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN). The hybridoma that produces the OKT3 anti-CD3ϵ mAb was from the American Type Cell Collection. TPCK-treated trypsin was from Worthington Biochemicals. The Lck expression plasmids were as before (13Alonso A. Rahmouni S. Williams S. van Stipdonk M. Jaroszewski L. Godzik A. Abraham R.T. Schoenberger S.P. Mustelin T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 39Caron L. Abraham N. Pawson T. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2720-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Recombinant Csk was as described earlier (46Yaqub S. Abrahamsen H. Zimmerman B. Kholod N. Torgersen K.M. Herberg F.W. Mustelin T. Taskén K. Vang T. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The polyclonal Lck antibody (38.10) was a kind gift from Dr O. Acuto (Oxford, UK).Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Lck mutants were generated using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All of the constructs were verified by sequencing.Cells—The Lck-negative subline of Jurkat JCaM1.6 (4Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) was kept at logarithmic growth in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics. COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum.Transient Transfections—20 × 106 JCaM1 were transfected with a total of 10-20 μg of DNA by electroporation at 960 microfarads and 240 V. Empty vector was added to control samples to make a constant amount of DNA in each sample. The cells were harvested 2 days after electroporation. COS-1 cells were transfected by lipofection with 10 μg of DNA and grown for 48 h prior to the experiments.Immunoprecipitation—These procedures were as reported before (47Rahmouni S. Tsutji T. Huynh H. Alonso A. Zhu C. Cerignoli F. Louisdit-Sully C. Jiang W. Mustelin T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 524-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 48Nika K. Charvet C. Williams S. Tautz L. Rahmouni S. Sasin J. Bottini N. Schoenberger S.P. Godzik A. Baier G. Altman A. Mustelin T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1806-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All of the steps were carried out at 0-4 °C. The cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3V04, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The clarified lysates were preadsorbed on agarose-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or protein G Sepharose. The lysates were then incubated with antibody for 2-4 h, followed by agarose-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or protein G Sepharose. Immune complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer, once in lysis buffer with 0.5 m NaCl, and again in lysis buffer and either suspended in SDS sample buffer or washed further for kinase assays.SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. The antisera were used at 1:500-1:2000 dilution, and the blots were developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Tryptic Peptide Mapping—Lck was phosphorylated by recombinant Csk (23Bergman M. Mustelin T. Oetken C. Partanen J. Flint N.A. Amrein K.E. Autero M. Burn P. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2919-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 46Yaqub S. Abrahamsen H. Zimmerman B. Kholod N. Torgersen K.M. Herberg F.W. Mustelin T. Taskén K. Vang T. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The proteins were resolved on 10% SDS gels, transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter, and exposed to film, and the correct band was excised. The filter piece was blocked and digested with TPCK-treated trypsin as described in detail by Luo et al. (49Luo K. Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 921-926PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting phosphopeptides were separated by electrophoresis on cellulose thin layer plates at pH 1.9 for 27 min followed by ascending chromatography in n-butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/water (75:50:15:60) and exposed to film.NFAT/AP1 Reporter Gene Assays—JCaM1 cells were transfected with NFAT/AP1-luc together with the Lck constructs or empty vector. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were either left unstimulated or treated with anti-CD3ϵ mAb for 7 h at 37 °C. The luciferase activity was normalized using a cotransfected Renilla luciferase.In Vitro Kinase Assay—Lck immunoprecipitates were incubated in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 μm ATP) containing 10 μCi of [γ32-P]ATP, with or without 2 μg of enolase (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min at 30 °C. The proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.Binding Interactions Measured by Surface Plasmon Resonance—Surface plasmon resonance experiments and data analysis were performed using a BIACORE 2000 instrument and BIAEVALUATION software (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). All of the experiments were conducted at 25 °C in a running buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, 3.4 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4. Immobilization of the different peptides on the CM5 sensor chip surface was performed using the amine-coupling kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The surface of the flow cell was activated with EDC/NHS for 15 min, followed by a 20-min injection of 2 mm concentration of each peptide. The chip was then deactivated by a 15-min injection of 1 m ethanolamine. The reference flow cells were treated identically except that no peptide was added. In a typical experiment 30 μl of Lck-SH2-GST (Santa Cruz) at concentrations ranging between 0.5 and 20 nm, were injected over the sample and reference flow cells at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. The chip surface was regenerated with 0.2% SDS in 50 mm HCl. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. The net surface plasmon resonance signal was obtained by subtracting the signal of the reference flow cell from that in the sample flow cell.Computer Modeling—A homology model of Lck was obtained using the SWISS-MODEL Server and the crystal structure of Y527-phophorylated full-length Hck in the inactive closed conformation (50; Protein Data Bank code 2HCK) as template. The last five C-terminal residues (YQPQP) were omitted from this first model. The obtained model structure, comprising Lck residues Gln62-Gln504, aligned very well with the template structure (RMSD = 0.11). Next, the missing C-terminal tail was added by modeling one amino acid at a time starting with Tyr(P)505. After each step, the energy of a 11 Å radius subset was minimized, using Powell method with 0.5 kcal/(mol*Å) termination gradient and MMFF94 force field algorithm. The final Lck model accurately represents the nature of SH2 domain binding and was essentially identical to the crystal structure of Hck (50Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Lck mutants were modeled using the same procedure.RESULTSLck Tail Mutants with Improved Tyr(P)505-SH2 Domain Binding—The optimal sequence for a phosphopeptide binding the SH2 domain of Src family PTK is pYEEI (51Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Leichleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar), a sequence quite different from that present in their C-terminal tails (reviewed in 20), pYQPQ (Lck), pYQQQ (Lyn and Hck), or pYQPG (c-Src, c-Yes, Fyn, Yrk, and c-Fgr). Only murine Blk has a better fit, pYELQ. As one would predict from these differences, the phosphorylated C terminus of c-Src binds to its SH2 domain with a ∼ 100-fold lower affinity than the pYEEI peptide. In the context of full-length Src family PTKs, the affinity is probably improved by intramolecular constraints and the participation of the SH3 domain in the “tail bite” conformation. Nevertheless, this low affinity of the C-terminal phospho-site for the SH2 domain may allow for activation of Src family PTKs by competing ligands with higher affinity for the SH2 domain.To better understand the structural basis for the interaction of Tyr(P)505 of Lck with its SH2 domain, we built a computer model of these parts of Lck using the crystal structure of Hck (50Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar) as template (Fig. 1A). The model shows that residues 499-504 fit into a shallow groove with Thr501 and Gln504 interacting with a ridge formed by Arg154 (yellow-orange in Fig. 1A). The phosphate on Tyr505 fits into a large basic pocket formed by Arg134, Arg154, Ser156, Ser164, Ser166, His180, and Lys182, whereas the C-terminal proline residue lies in a shallow hydrophobic pocket (formed by Leu165, Val167, Tyr182, Ile184, Ile193, Leu205, Tyr209, Leu216, and Leu220). The interactions between the C terminus of Lck and the SH2 domain are mostly mediated by Tyr(P)505, explaining the relatively low affinity of interaction.To strengthen the tail bite of Lck, we created three mutants in which the three amino acids following Tyr505 were changed one at a time from the wild-type sequence YQPQ toward the ideal sequence YEEI. The three mutants had the sequences YQPI, YQEI, and YEEI (Fig. 1B). A fourth mutant had Tyr505 changed to phenylalanine (Y505F; sequence FQPQ). To first determine whether these sequences indeed generate intermediate affinities for the SH2 domain in the anticipated graded manner, we synthesized five 15-amino acid peptides corresponding to the wild-type C terminus (amino acid residues 498-509) and the four mutant versions. These peptides were immobilized on a CM5 chip for surface plasmon resonance measurements in a BIAcore 2000 instrument with various concentrations of the SH2 domain. As shown in Fig. 1C, the phosphopeptides indeed bound to the Lck-SH2 with affinities varying from low nanomolar for the pYEEI peptide (average kb 12.7 nm from several measurements) to no binding at all for the FQPQ peptide. The wild-type sequence bound with an average Kb of 0.3 μm, whereas the affinities for the intermediate peptides were 0.26 μm for the pYQPI peptide and 0.032 μm for the pYQEI peptide, respectively. Thus, these sequences have the intended graded affinities.Structural Basis for Improved Affinity—To better understand the structural basis for the increased affinity of the mutated C termini to the SH2 domain of Lck, we modeled them using the same approach as for wild-type Lck. In the first mutant, Q508I (Lck-QPI) (Fig. 2A), the conformation of the tail is very similar to that in wild-type Lck (RMSD = 0.03). However, side chain of mutated Ile508 makes additional hydrophobic interactions with Pro195 and side chain methylene group of Ser194, which most likely accounts for slightly tighter binding of the mutant tail to the SH2 domain.FIGURE 2Binding of the mutant C termini to the SH2 domain of Lck.

Scientific data are the currency of science, but they often buy little understanding outside science itself—or even outside the narrow confines of a single scientific discipline. But when data are brought to life through images, illustrations, computer graphics, and animations, they can stimulate excitement, awe, new ways of looking at things, and, above all, a broad appreciation of even the most esoteric scientific information. The stunning photograph on the cover of this week's issue of Science is a case in point. It reveals the humble and ubiquitous seaweed Irish moss ( Chondrus crispus ) to be an intricate natural construction that looks for all the world like an abstract painting.

For the past 5 years, Science and the National Science Foundation (NSF) have cosponsored annual challenges to encourage cutting-edge efforts to visualize scientific data. Our interest in supporting these competitions is based on our firm belief that bringing data to life visually will be increasingly important not only for public understanding of science and engineering but also for improving communication across scientific disciplines.

This year, we received more than 200 entries from 34 states and 23 countries representing every continent except Antarctica. A committee of staff members from Science and NSF screened the entries, and an outside panel of experts in scientific visualization reviewed the finalists and selected the winners. The winning entries appear on the following pages. (No awards were made this year for illustration.)

We encourage you to submit applications for next year's challenge, details of which will be available at [www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/scivis/index.jsp][2], and to join us in celebrating this year's winners.

Susan Mason of NSF organized this year's challenge. Benjamin Lester of Science 's news staff wrote the text that accompanies the images in this special section, and Stewart Wills and Tara Marathe put together a special Web presentation at [www.sciencemag.org/sciext/vis2007][3].
