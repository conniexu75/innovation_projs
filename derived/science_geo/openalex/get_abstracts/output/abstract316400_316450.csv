https://openalex.org/W2066324956,"Average species durations were estimated for 131 commonly occurring modern species. The duration of species occurring at depths of less than 200 meters is 16 million years, while for those at greater than 200 meters and at all depths it is 25 to 26 million years. Species (less than 200 meters) distributed from Florida to Newfoundland and from Florida to Cape Hatteras have about the same durations (18 to 20 million years). The duration for species restricted to north of Cape Hatteras is only 7 million years. The data suggest that evolutionary rates are greater in shallower than in deeper depths and greatest in the shallower northern area."
https://openalex.org/W2096364253,"The trails of mucus secreted by certain species of intertidal limpets serve as adhesive traps for the microalgae that are their primary food resource. In addition, the mucus trails of two solitary homing limpets, Lottia gigantea and Collisella scabra, stimulate growth of the microalgae that the limpets consume. In contrast, the trails of an aggregating limpet, Collisella digitalis, do not stimulate microalgal growth. These results and their possible ecological significance are interpreted in light of the differences in the behavioral repertoires of the three limpet species."
https://openalex.org/W2138639929,"Calcitic pseudomorphs of desma-like siliceous spicules found in the calcareous skeleton of a Devonian thamnoporid support the proposal of poriferan origin of at least some favositid Tabulata. These favositids arose from a group of Ordovician lithistid demosponges that adapted to toxic calcium excess in shallow, tropical marine environments by developing calicoblasts within the pinacoderm, supplementing their primary siliceous spicular skeletons with basally secreted calcium carbonate. They are tentatively recognized as an order of the subclass Sclerospongiae (class Demospongiae)."
https://openalex.org/W2147386042,"The results of observations over 3(1/2) solar cycles of ionosonde parameters describing sporadic-E patches (E(s)) are given for two Southern Hemisphere stations. Analysis has revealed systematic changes in the occurrence probabilities of f(o)E(s) and f(b)E(s), changes that are independent of time of day or season. It is unlikely that observational effects can be entirely responsible for the trends, which suggest that major long-term changes may be occurring at E region heights."
