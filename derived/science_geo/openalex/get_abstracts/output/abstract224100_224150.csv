https://openalex.org/W2063614219,"Stein and Weiss1 have shown that hydroxyl radicals can be detected in solution by their ability to oxidize the benzene nucleus, leading to the formation of phenol derivatives. These hydroxyl radicals were produced in situ both by irradiation of aqueous substrate solutions with X-rays, α-rays, etc., and by the use of Fenton's reagent. Similar results were obtained with the latter by Merz and Waters2. Evans and Uri3 have shown that irradiation of aqueous solutions of ion pair complexes such as Fe3+OH−, Fe3+Cl−, Fe3+F−, etc., with ultra-violet light (300–400mµ) produces atoms or free radicals in solution able to initiate the polymerization of vinyl compounds. Experimental evidence indicates that the ion-pair complexes postulated by Rabinowitch and Stock-mayer4 are the photochemically active entities in ferric salt solutions. In the light of these findings, we investigated the effect of monochromatic light of wave-length 365 mµ, on aqueous solutions of benzoic acid in the presence of ferric ion-pair complexes. Benzoic acid was chosen as substrate because the formation of the very intensely coloured ferric salicylate complex is convenient for a photometric determination."

In the course of a detailed investigation of the problem, preliminary studies were undertaken in the 1949–50 season for the factors influencing diapause."

The following presents some results on vitamin B12 as determined from the growth of Euglena gracilis. Materials. The culture of Euglena gracilis var. bacillaris employed was kindly supplied by Dr. S. H. Hutner. Three media were used. The composition of Medium I and Medium II we owe to the courtesy of Dr. Hutner and Dr. T. H. Jukes. Medium I (acid) and II (neutral) were used for the cultivation of Euglena. Medium III was devised for the detection of organisms which synthesize B12. Medium I, in addition to mineral salts, contained thiamine, glutamic acid and malic acid. Its pH was adjusted to 3.0. It was prepared by mixing suitable amounts of three stock solutions."

https://openalex.org/W2030187387,"MANY studies have been made of streptococcal hæmolysins. Todd1 demonstrated essential differences between the ‘O’ and ‘S’ forms of streptolysin. Herbert and Todd2 made a more exhaustive study of streptolysin ‘O’ and characterized it as a protein capable of hæmolysing red cells, only, however, after activation with —SH-containing reducing agents."
