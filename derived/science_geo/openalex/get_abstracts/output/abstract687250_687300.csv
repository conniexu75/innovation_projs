https://openalex.org/W4205094401,"The function of a protein is strongly dependent on its structure. During evolution, proteins acquire new functions through mutations in the amino-acid sequence. Given the advance in deep mutational scanning, recent findings have found functional change to be position dependent, notwithstanding the chemical properties of mutant and mutated amino acids. This could indicate that structural properties of a given position are potentially responsible for the functional relevance of a mutation. Here, we looked at the relation between structure and function of positions using five proteins with experimental data of functional change available. In order to measure structural change, we modeled mutated proteins via amino-acid networks and quantified the perturbation of each mutation. We found that structural change is position dependent, and strongly related to functional change. Strong changes in protein structure correlate with functional loss, and positions with functional gain due to mutations tend to be structurally robust. Finally, we constructed a computational method to predict functionally sensitive positions to mutations using structural change that performs well on all five proteins with a mean precision of 74.7% and recall of 69.3% of all functional positions."
https://openalex.org/W4226107243,"We present a novel Deep Learning method for the Unsupervised Clustering of DNA Sequences (DeLUCS) that does not require sequence alignment, sequence homology, or (taxonomic) identifiers. DeLUCS uses Frequency Chaos Game Representations (FCGR) of primary DNA sequences, and generates ""mimic"" sequence FCGRs to self-learn data patterns (genomic signatures) through the optimization of multiple neural networks. A majority voting scheme is then used to determine the final cluster assignment for each sequence. The clusters learned by DeLUCS match true taxonomic groups for large and diverse datasets, with accuracies ranging from 77% to 100%: 2,500 complete vertebrate mitochondrial genomes, at taxonomic levels from sub-phylum to genera; 3,200 randomly selected 400 kbp-long bacterial genome segments, into clusters corresponding to bacterial families; three viral genome and gene datasets, averaging 1,300 sequences each, into clusters corresponding to virus subtypes. DeLUCS significantly outperforms two classic clustering methods (K-means++ and Gaussian Mixture Models) for unlabelled data, by as much as 47%. DeLUCS is highly effective, it is able to cluster datasets of unlabelled primary DNA sequences totalling over 1 billion bp of data, and it bypasses common limitations to classification resulting from the lack of sequence homology, variation in sequence length, and the absence or instability of sequence annotations and taxonomic identifiers. Thus, DeLUCS offers fast and accurate DNA sequence clustering for previously intractable datasets."
https://openalex.org/W4206279938,"We propose a model of cancer initiation and progression where tumor growth is modulated by an evolutionary coordination game. Evolutionary games of cancer are widely used to model frequency-dependent cell interactions with the most studied games being the Prisoner’s Dilemma and public goods games. Coordination games, by their more obscure and less evocative nature, are left understudied, despite the fact that, as we argue, they offer great potential in understanding and treating cancer. In this paper we present the conditions under which coordination games between cancer cells evolve, we propose aspects of cancer that can be modeled as results of coordination games, and explore the ways through which coordination games of cancer can be exploited for therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4226057080,"Whitefly (Bemisia tabaci Gennadius) is a hemipteran phyto polyphagous sucking insect pest which is an important pest of cotton that causes economic losses to the crop by reducing its yield and quality. Ecdysteroids such as 20-hydroxy ecdysone (20-E), play a significant role in larval moulting, development, and reproduction in pterygota insects. Receptor of 20-E, that is Ecdysone Receptor (BtEcR) of Bemisia tabaci has been targeted to prevent fundamental developmental processes. To identify potent inhibitors of BtEcr, 98,072 natural compounds were retrieved from ZINC database. A structure-based virtual screening of these compounds was performed for evaluating their binding affinity to BtEcR, and top two compounds (ZINC08952607 and ZINC04264850) selected based on lowest binding energy. Molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) study was performed for analyzing the dynamics and stability of BtEcR and top-scoring ligand-BtEcR complexes at 50 ns. Besides, g_mmpbsa tool was also used to calculate and analyse the binding free energy of BtEcR-ligand complexes. Compounds ZINC08952607 and ZINC04264850 had shown a binding free energy of -170.156 kJ mol-1 and -200.349 kJ mol-1 in complex with BtEcR respectively. Thus, these compounds can be utilized as lead for the development of environmentally safe insecticides against the whitefly."
https://openalex.org/W4205116275,"The Upper Cretaceous (Campanian Stage) Kaiparowits Formation of southern Utah, USA, preserves abundant plant, invertebrate, and vertebrate fossil taxa. Taken together, these fossils indicate that the ecosystems preserved in the Kaiparowits Formation were characterized by high biodiversity. Hundreds of vertebrate and invertebrate species and over 80 plant morphotypes are recognized from the formation, but insects and their associations with plants are largely undocumented. Here, we describe a new fossil leaf taxon, Catula gettyi gen et. sp. nov. in the family Lauraceae from the Kaiparowits Formation. Catula gettyi occurs at numerous localities in this deposit that represent ponded and distal floodplain environments. The type locality for C . gettyi has yielded 1,564 fossil leaf specimens of this species, which provides the opportunity to circumscribe this new plant species. By erecting this new genus and species, we are able to describe ecological associations on C . gettyi and place these interactions within a taxonomic context. We describe an extensive archive of feeding damage on C . gettyi caused by herbivorous insects, including more than 800 occurrences of insect damage belonging to five functional feeding groups indicating that insect-mediated damage on this taxon is both rich and abundant. Catula gettyi is one of the best-sampled host plant taxa from the Mesozoic Era, a poorly sampled time interval, and its insect damage is comparable to other Lauraceae taxa from the younger Late Cretaceous Hell Creek Flora of North Dakota, USA."
https://openalex.org/W4205527518,"Background Miscarriages affect up to a fifth of all pregnancies and are associated with substantial psychological morbidity. However, their relationship with cardiometabolic risk factors is not well known. Therefore, in this study we aimed to estimate the burden of cardiovascular risk factors including diabetes mellitus (type 1 or 2) and hypertension in women with miscarriage compared to women without a record of miscarriage. Methods A population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted using IVQIA Medical Research Data UK (IMRD-UK) between January 1995 and May 2016, an anonymised electronic health records database that is representative of the UK population. A total of 86,509, 16–50-year-old women with a record of miscarriage (exposed group) were matched by age, smoking status, and body mass index to 329,865 women without a record of miscarriage (unexposed group). Patients with pre-existing hypertension and diabetes were excluded. Adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for diabetes and hypertension were estimated using multivariable Poisson regression models offsetting for person-years follow-up. Results The mean age at cohort entry was 31 years and median follow up was 4.6 (IQR 1.7–9.4) years. During the study period, a total of 792 (IR 1.44 per 1000 years) and 2525 (IR 1.26 per 1000 years) patients developed diabetes in the exposed and unexposed groups, respectively. For hypertension, 1995 (IR 3.73 per 1000 years) and 1605 (IR 3.39 per 1000 years) new diagnoses were recorded in the exposed and unexposed groups, respectively. Compared to unexposed individuals, women with a record miscarriage were more likely to develop diabetes (aIRR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.15–1.36; p&lt;0.001) and hypertension (aIRR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.02–1.12; p = 0.005). Conclusions Women diagnosed with miscarriage were at increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Women with history of miscarriage may benefit from periodic monitoring of their cardiometabolic health."
https://openalex.org/W4205751038,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been widely spread and affected millions of people and caused hundreds of deaths worldwide, especially in patients with comorbilities and COVID-19. This manuscript aims to present models to predict, firstly, the number of coronavirus cases and secondly, the hospital care demand and mortality based on COVID-19 patients who have been diagnosed with other diseases. For the first part, I present a projection of the spread of coronavirus in Mexico, which is based on a contact tracing model using Bayesian inference. I investigate the health profile of individuals diagnosed with coronavirus to predict their type of patient care (inpatient or outpatient) and survival. Specifically, I analyze the comorbidity associated with coronavirus using Machine Learning. I have implemented two classifiers: I use the first classifier to predict the type of care procedure that a person diagnosed with coronavirus presenting chronic diseases will obtain (i.e. outpatient or hospitalised), in this way I estimate the hospital care demand; I use the second classifier to predict the survival or mortality of the patient (i.e. survived or deceased). I present two techniques to deal with these kinds of unbalanced datasets related to outpatient/hospitalised and survived/deceased cases (which occur in general for these types of coronavirus datasets) to obtain a better performance for the classification."
https://openalex.org/W4206943989,"Brazil has been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The high numbers of confirmed cases and deaths have continued unabated since the first reported case, with no flattening or downward turn in the curve. In this context, healthcare workers have been exposed uninterruptedly to stress factors throughout a year of the pandemic. The study´s aim was to identify and analyze healthcare workers´ perceptions of their feelings and concerns that have surfaced in responding to the pandemic. Method: This was a cross-sectional online qualitative survey study of 554 healthcare personnel working in the state of Rio de Janeiro during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recruitment occurred from July 20 to September 30, 2020, using an online survey, preceded byfree informed consent term. Data were analyzed with the Iramuteq software. Results: Through a dendrogram, the words with the highest chi-square were highlighted and grouped into four classes: healthcare workers´ fear of falling ill to COVID-19 and infecting their family members; work/labor issues; feelings of powerlessness and need for public policies for government action; and fatigue and burnout in the pandemic. Each word class was also illustrated by a similarity tree. Conclusion: The study revealed healthcare workers´ exacerbated fear of infection and transmission of COVID-19 to their family members, besides financial losses and feelings of powerlessness and abandonment."
https://openalex.org/W4207011184,"The inclusion of life satisfaction in government policies as a tracker of the social and economic progress of citizens has been recommended. This has encouraged the scientific investigation of life satisfaction levels of people in tandem with factors responsible for these levels. Only a few studies have attempted to do this in Ghana with mixed findings. This study, therefore, extends previous literature by examining the determinants of life satisfaction among Ghanaians in two ways: a full sample and a gender-stratified sample. We analysed cross-sectional data from the 2017/2018 Ghana Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey Six (MICS 6). A sample of 20,059 women and men of ages ranging from 15 to 49 years participated in this study. The Cantril's Self-Anchoring Ladder Life Satisfaction scale was used to capture the life satisfaction of participants alongside relevant sociodemographic questions. About 35% of participants reported they were satisfied in life with males reporting more suffering levels [39.59%; 95% CI:36.38, 42.88] and females more thriving levels [36.41%; 95% CI:35.01, 37.84]. In the full sample multivariable model, gender, age, parity, education, marital status, wealth index, and region of residence were significantly associated with life satisfaction. Gender variations were also found across these associations. These findings collectively provide useful information for policymakers and practitioners to optimize interventions for the Ghanaian population aimed at improving life satisfaction. Evidence from this study also calls on the government of Ghana to begin tracking the life satisfaction of her citizens."
https://openalex.org/W4205293903,"In the beginning of the COVID-19 US epidemic in March 2020, sweeping lockdowns and other aggressive measures were put in place and retained in many states until end of August of 2020; the ensuing economic downturn has led many to question the wisdom of the early COVID-19 policy measures in the US. This study's objective was to evaluate the cost and benefit of the US COVID-19-mitigating policy intervention during the first six month of the pandemic in terms of COVID-19 mortality potentially averted, versus mortality potentially attributable to the economic downturn. We conducted a synthesis-based retrospective cost-benefit analysis of the full complex of US federal, state, and local COVID-19-mitigating measures, including lockdowns and all other COVID-19-mitigating measures, against the counterfactual scenario involving no public health intervention. We derived parameter estimates from a rapid review and synthesis of recent epidemiologic studies and economic literature on regulation-attributable mortality. According to our estimates, the policy intervention saved 866,350-1,711,150 lives (4,886,214-9,650,886 quality-adjusted life-years), while mortality attributable to the economic downturn was 57,922-245,055 lives (2,093,811-8,858,444 life-years). We conclude that the number of lives saved by the spring-summer lockdowns and other COVID-19-mitigation was greater than the number of lives potentially lost due to the economic downturn. However, the net impact on quality-adjusted life expectancy is ambiguous."

Significance for performance, egg quality, serum biochemistry, and ileal digestibility of protein was determined at P ≤ 0.05. Level, week, and level*week (L*W) were significant for production, egg mass, and feed intake. Level and week were significant for FCR. Week was significant for weight gain. Level was significant for egg weight, specific gravity, and shell thickness; week was also significant for these external egg parameters as well as shape index and proportional shell thickness. L*W was significant for all except shape index. For internal egg measurements, level was significant for proportional yolk, proportional albumen, yolk index, and yolk:albumen. Week was significant for internal egg parameters while L*W significantly affected Haugh unit, proportional albumen weight, yolk index, albumen index, and yolk color. Level was significant for globulin and glucose in serum. Isoleucine at 0.72%, 0.81%, and 0.84% produced the lowest FCR, an important standard in the poultry industry. Considering the low FCR of 1.45 and cost for inclusion as a dietary ingredient, 0.72% isoleucine was chosen for further studies with varying quantities of other branched chain amino acids in diets for young laying hens."
https://openalex.org/W4206571138,"Facilitating the childbirth process is a global issue. Many strategies have been developed to cope with labor pain and improve the delivery experience and satisfaction of pregnant women. The results of different types of medical intervention on women's expectant pain have been varied. Therefore, this systematic review was aimed at summarizing the body of evidence regarding the effects of various non-pharmacological coping strategies for reducing labor pain.The review was conducted according to guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). We systematically searched the articles published between 1989 and 2020 in six electronic databases: PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, WOS, PsycARTICLES, and Airiti Library, and the reference lists of the Clinical Trial Registry. Twenty studies were identified, with eight eligible studies included in the Bayesian network meta-analysis.Eight studies with 713 participants were included in the meta-analysis with nine different non-pharmacological strategies for reducing labor pain. The traditional meta-analysis demonstrated that the non-pharmacological coping strategies were effective in reducing labor pain. Of these interventional strategies, the ranking probabilities analysis of the network meta-analysis suggested that the Bonapace Method may be the most effective strategy in reducing labor pain, followed by acupressure.Non-pharmacological coping strategies can reduce labor pain while maintaining an effective and satisfactory delivery experience. This systematic review, by synthesizing the body of evidence, demonstrated that non-pharmacological coping strategies are effective in reducing labor pain. Furthermore, as demonstrated in the network meta-analysis, the Bonapace Method, modulating birth pain by involving the father, is the most effective non-pharmacological intervention for reducing labor pain."
https://openalex.org/W4206970610,"The morphological diversity of floral organs can largely be attributed to functional divergence in the MADS-box gene family. Nonetheless, research based on the ABCDE model has yet to conclusively determine whether the AGAMOUS-LIKE 6 ( AGL6 ) subgroup has a direct influence on floral organ development. In the current study, the ABCDE model was used to quantify the contributions of ABCDE and AGL6 genes in the emergence of floral organs. We determined that the flower formation contribution values of the ABCDE and AGL6 genes were as follows: A gene, 0.192; B gene, 0.231; CD gene, 0.192; E gene, 0.385; and AGL6 , 0.077. As AGL6 does not directly influence floral structure formation, the contribution value of AGL6 to flower formation was low. Furthermore, the gradient values of the floral organs were as follows: sepals, 0.572; petals, 1.606; stamens, 2.409; and carpels, 2.288. We also performed detailed analysis of the ABCDE and AGL6 genes using the Circlize package in R. Our results suggest that these genes likely emerged in one of two orders: 1) B genes→CD genes→ AGL6 →E genes→A genes; or 2) B genes→CD genes→ AGL6 /E genes→A genes. We use the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to prove the contribution values and gradient values of floral organs. This is the first study to understand the contribution values of ABCDE and AGL6 genes using the AHP and the Circlize package in R."
https://openalex.org/W4205278144,"The Alzheimer's brain is affected by multiple pathophysiological processes, which include a unique, organ-specific form of insulin resistance that begins early in its course. An additional complexity arises from the four-fold risk of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in type 2 diabetics, however there is no definitive proof of causation. Several strategies to improve brain insulin signaling have been proposed and some have been clinically tested. We report findings on a small allosteric molecule that reverses several indices of insulin insensitivity in both cell culture and in vitro models of AD that emphasize the intracellular accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβi). PS48, a chlorophenyl pentenoic acid, is an allosteric activator of PDK-1, which is an Akt-kinase in the insulin/PI3K pathway. PS48 was active at 10 nM to 1 μM in restoring normal insulin-dependent Akt activation and in mitigating Aβi peptide toxicity. Synaptic plasticity (LTP) in prefrontal cortical slices from normal rat exposed to Aβ oligomers also benefited from PS48. During these experiments, neither overstimulation of PI3K/Akt signaling nor toxic effects on cells was observed. Another neurotoxicity model producing insulin insensitivity, utilizing palmitic acid, also responded to PS48 treatment, thus validating the target and indicating that its therapeutic potential may extend outside of β-amyloid reliance. The described in vitro and cell based-in vitro coupled enzymatic assay systems proved suitable platforms to screen a preliminary library of new analogs."

This study assessed the prevalence of substance use and its key risk factors amongst female sex workers (FSWs) at two sites in South Africa.Two cross-sectional studies were conducted, in Soweto and Klerksdorp, South Africa. Using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) 508 FSWs in Soweto and 156 in Klerksdorp were enrolled. A study-specific survey was used to collect social and demographic information, substance use, mental ill-health, and HIV status. Raw and RDS-adjusted data were analyzed using Chi-squared tests of association. Weighted and unweighted Poisson regression models were used to assess key risk factors for alcohol and drug use at both univariate and multivariate levels.Of the 664 FSWs, 56.2% were binge drinkers and 29.4% reported using drugs within the last year. Living in a home with regular food (RR: 1.2597, 95% CI: 1.1009-1.4413) and being HIV positive (RR: 1.1678, 95% CI: 1.0227-1.3334) were associated with a higher risk of binge drinking. Having symptoms suggestive of post-traumatic stress disorder (RR: 1.1803, 95% CI: 1.0025-1.3895) and past year physical/sexual abuse from either intimate (RR: 1.3648, 95% CI: 1.1522-1.6167) or non-intimate partners (RR: 1.3910, 95% CI: 1.1793-1.6407) were associated with a higher risk of drug use.In conclusion, our findings demonstrate a high prevalence of alcohol and drug use among FSWs in Soweto and Klerksdorp with site-specific contextual dynamics driving substance use. Site differences highlight the importance of tailoring site-specific substance use harm mitigation for this key population."
https://openalex.org/W4205897651,"Approximately 35% of Nepal's children have not received all recommended vaccines, and barriers to immunization exist on both the demand- (i.e., access, affordability, acceptance) and supply- (i.e., logistics, infrastructure) sides.This article describes a formative study to understand the barriers to and facilitators of immunization in Makwanpur, Nepal from both the demand- and supply-sides.Through in-depth interviews, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions (N = 76), we assessed knowledge, attitudes, and experiences with immunization; social norms related to immunization; perceptions of local health facilities; and descriptions of client-provider relationships. Data were analyzed using an iterative, grounded theory approach.Three major themes emerged, including positive demand of vaccines, lack of mutual trust between service seekers and service providers, and internal and external motivators of vaccine supply. On the demand-side, caregivers reported high levels of immunization-related awareness, knowledge, and acceptance, largely perceived to be due to a generational shift. On the supply-side, providers expressed passion for their work despite lack of support from local authorities and a desire for more training. Between caregivers and providers, lack of mutual trust emerged as a prominent barrier, revealing a cycle of positive service bias.We identified mutual trust as a key pathway toward reaching full immunization coverage in Nepal and we recommend future interventions adopt an approach which focuses on removing social barriers (i.e., distrust) and structural barriers (i.e., opening hours, neglected infrastructure) to immunization."

A generative adversarial network framework was used to train unpaired datasets. The trained deep learning method generated virtual SDCT images (VIs) from the original LDCT images (OIs). To test the proposed method, LDCT images (80 kVp, 262 mAs, n = 33) were collected from another CT scanner using iterative reconstruction (IR). Image analyses were performed to evaluate the qualities of VIs in the validation set and to compare the performance of deep learning and IR in the test set.The noise of the VIs was the lowest in both validation and test sets (all p<0.001). The mean CT number of the VIs for the portal vein and liver was lower than that of OIs in both validation and test sets (all p<0.001) and was similar to those of SDCT. The contrast-to-noise ratio of portal vein and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of portal vein and liver of VIs were higher than those of SDCT (all p<0.05). The SNR of VIs in test sets was the highest among three images.The deep learning method trained by unpaired datasets could reduce noise of LDCT images and showed similar performance to SAFIRE. It can be applied to LDCT images of older CT scanners without IR."
https://openalex.org/W4206029699,"When keystroke dynamics are used for authentication, users tend to get different levels of security due to differences in the quality of their templates. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a metric to quantify the quality of keystroke dynamic templates. That is, in behavioral biometric verification, the user’s templates are generally constructed using multiple enrolled samples to capture intra-user variation. This variation is then used to normalize the distance between a set of enrolled samples and a test sample. Then a normalized distance is compared against a predefined threshold value to derive a verification decision. As a result, the coverage area for accepted samples in the original space of vector representation is discrete. Therefore, users with the higher intra-user variation suffer higher false acceptance rates (FAR). This paper proposes a metric that can be used to reflect the verification performance of individual keystroke dynamic templates in terms of FAR. Specifically, the metric is derived from statistical information of user-specific feature variations, and it has a non-decreasing property when a new feature is added to a template. The experiments are performed based on two public keystroke dynamic datasets comprising of two main types of keystroke dynamics: constrained-text and free-text, namely the CMU keystroke dynamics dataset and the Web-Based Benchmark for keystroke dynamics dataset. Experimental results based on multiple classifiers demonstrate that the proposed metric can be a good indicator of the template’s false acceptance rate. Thus, it can be used to enhance the security of the user authentication system based on keystroke dynamics."

Using two surveys that relied on quota sampling reflecting the Japanese demographic composition (n = 1024 & n = 2975), the results of the descriptive analysis show that the most preferred strategy at the individual level was wait-and-see, allowing for a risk assessment of side effects. Via conjoint analysis, I also found that participants who recalled blood relatives as their familiar entities tended to prefer a wait-and-see strategy for themselves and their blood relatives. The results of these analyses suggest that wait-and-see strategies for vaccination are preferred in Japan, making it difficult to achieve early herd immunity through vaccination."

There are limited options to treat the PCa, this study tried to determine a new therapy option for this acute cancer. Androgen-independent PCa cell lines PC3 and DU145 were treated with different melatonin concentrations (0.1~3.5 mM) for 1~3 days and assessed cell migration, cell invasion, cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase as well as apoptosis. We utilized RNA-seq technology to analyze the transcriptional misregulation pathways in DU145 prostate cancer cell line with melatonin (0.5 mM) treatment. Data revealed 20031 genes were up and down-regulated, there were 271 genes that differentially expressed: 97 up-regulated (P<0.05) and 174 down-regulated (P<0.05) genes. Furthermore, RNA-seq results manifested that the melatonin treatment led to a significant increase in the expression levels of HPGD, IL2Rβ, NGFR, however, IGFBP3 and IL6 (P <0.05) had decreased expression levels. The immunoblot assay revealed the expression of IL2Rβ and NGFR genes was up-regulated, qPCR confirmed the gene expression of HPGD and IL2RB were also up-regulated in Du145 cells. Consequently, we probed mechanisms that generate kinetic patterns of NF-κB-dependent gene expression in PCa cells responding to a NF-κB-activation, the significant results were indicated by the inhibition of the NF-kB pathway via IL2Rβ actions. Based on our investigation, it could be concluded that melatonin is a chemotherapeutic molecule against PCa and provides a new idea for clinical therapy of PCa."
https://openalex.org/W4206945598,"China is still one of the countries dominated by thermal power generation. In order to generate more efficient, stable and clean power, it is necessary to evaluate thermal power generation units (TPGU). Firstly, a comprehensive evaluation index system for TPGU with 20 secondary indicators was established from four aspects: reliability indicators, economic indicators, technical supervision indicators, and major operating indicators. Secondly, the entropy weight method can be used to calculate the weight of each second-level index. Mahalanobis Distance improved Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method is coupled with the Grey Relational Analysis (GRA), and the comprehensive evaluation values of 5 units (600MW) are respectively 0.4516, 0.5247, 0.3551, 0.5589 and 0.6168 from both vertical and horizontal dimensions. Finally, by comparing and analyzing this method with the above research methods, it is found that the results obtained by this method which re-establishes the coordinate system based on the data set are more accurate. In addition, this method can effectively evaluate the operation of TPGU, which is of great significance for cleaner production while generating electricity. In conclusion, some suggestions on clean production of TPGU are put forward, and the innovation points and limitations of this paper are pointed out."
https://openalex.org/W4206977131,"Backgrounds An increasing incidence of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) has been reported in several Western countries. However, the epidemiology of AML in Asia is very limited. According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline of AML, a range of conventional therapy options is available to AML patients. Nevertheless, different treatment strategies may result in diverse healthcare utilization and costs. Understanding the treatment patterns, healthcare utilization and costs of AML would thus be essential for clinicians and policymakers to optimize the treatment strategies of AML. Objectives The objective of this study was to investigate the incidence, treatment patterns, healthcare utilization and costs of AML in Taiwan using a nationwide population database. Methods We retrospectively identified AML patients diagnosed from 2006 to 2015 from the Taiwan Cancer Registry Database (TCRD) and estimated the epidemiology of AML in Taiwan. The TCRD was linked to National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) to collect the treatment patterns and health care utilization. Patients diagnosed with AML from 2011 to 2015 were further identified to analyze treatment patterns, healthcare utilization and costs. Results The crude annual incidence of AML increased from 2.78 to 3.21 cases per 100,000 individuals from 2006 to 2015. However, the age-standardized rate (ASRs) of AML slightly declined from 2.47 to 2.41 cases per 100,000 individuals in the same period. Among 2,179 AML patients who received induction therapy (median age: 56 years), most of them (n = 1744; 80.04%) received standard-dose cytarabine (SDAC) regimen. The remaining 162 patients received high dose cytarabine (HDAC) and 273 patients received non-standard dose cytarabine (N-SDAC) regimen as the induction therapy. The median medical costs in our study for patients treated with chemotherapy alone was $42,271 for HDAC, $36,199 for SDAC and $36,250 for N-SDAC. For those who received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after induction therapy, their median medical costs were $78,876 for HDAC, $78,593 for SDAC and $79,776 for N-SDAC. Conclusions This study is the first population-based study conducted in Asia to provide updated and comprehensive information on epidemiology, treatment patterns and healthcare resource utilization and costs of AML."
https://openalex.org/W4207082709,"Background Improving access to maternal health services has been a priority for the health sector in low-income countries; the utilization of facility delivery services has remained low. Although Ethiopia provides free maternal health services in all public health facilities utilization of services has not been as expected. Objective This study examined predictors of facility delivery service utilization in central Ethiopia. Methods We conducted a community-based case-control study within the catchment areas of selected public health facilities in central Ethiopia. Women who delivered their last child in a health facility were considered as cases and women who delivered their last child at home were considered as controls. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of facility delivery utilization. Result Facility delivery was positive and strongly associated with practicing birth preparedness and complication readiness (BPCR) (AOR = 12.3, 95%CI: 3.9, 39.1); partners’ involvement about obstetric assistance (AOR = 3.1, 95%CI: 1.0, 9.0); spending 30 or less minutes to decide on the place of delivery and 45 or less minutes to walk to health facilities (AOR = 7.4, 95%CI: 2.4, 23.2 and AOR = 8.1, 95%CI: 2.5, 26.9, respectively). Additionally, having knowledge of obstetric complication, attending ≥ 4 antenatal care (ANC) visits, birth order and the use of free ambulance service also showed significant association with facility delivery. Conclusion Despite the availability of free maternal services there are still many barriers to utilization of delivery services. Strengthening efforts to bring delivery services closer to home and enhancing BPCR are necessary to increase institutional delivery service utilization."

Both numerical simulations and simulation experiments are conducted to simulate the deformation process at the stope roof and bottom from excavation and filling. The assumption of macroscopic continuity from traditional continuum mechanics models is overcome. The simulation results demonstrate that the ground subsidence is slowed due to filling. The total trends of the top and bottom displacements are sinkable and upturned, respectively. Moreover, with an increased buried depth and lateral pressure coefficient, the displacements of the top and bottom of the stope increase as well. The characteristics and evolution of the displacement vector field of the rock mass are macroscopically and microscopically studied over the excavation progress. This provides technical support for stope safety production."
https://openalex.org/W4206209125,"Aim To assess the association between self-reported health (SRH) and mortality from all-causes, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer, in adults 65 years and older in Spain. Methods We analysed data of 894 adults (504 women, 390 men) aged 65 years and above from two population-based studies, the EUREYE-Spain study and the Valencia Nutritional Survey (VNS). SRH was assessed at baseline using a single question which is widely used in epidemiological studies: “Overall, how would you consider your health at present?” and the response options were: 1. Very good, 2. Good, 3. Fair, 4. Poor, 5. Very poor. Deaths were ascertained during a 12-year follow-up period, and we used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain adjusted hazard ratios (HR). Results During the 12 years of follow-up (8566.2 person-years), we observed 400 deaths, 158 (39.5%) due to CVD and 89 (22.3%) due to cancer. Fair and poor/very poor SRH were significantly associated with higher all-cause mortality after 12-years of follow-up, HR = 1.29 (95% CI, 1.03–1.61) and HR 1.53 (95% CI, 1.09–2.15), respectively. We observed evidence of higher CVD mortality among those who reported fair and poor/very poor SRH, although the association was attenuated and lost statistical significance in the fully adjusted models. Conclusion This study suggests that a poor SRH status is associated with a higher all-cause mortality risk among older adults in Spain. Checking SHR status may be useful to plan health care in older adults."
https://openalex.org/W4206381719,"With the intensification of fish farming, the amount of residues also increased. One of the by-products generated is leather. However, several factors influence its quality, among them, the types of tanning used. Paiche (Arapaima gigas) is the largest freshwater fish in the world, and therefore has great potential in the use of leather, in addition to being one of the most cultivated fish in the Rondônia state. The aimed was to evaluate the physicomechanical resistance, histological and morphological aspects in different directions of the fibers of the paiche to evaluate the tanning with chromium oxide and vegetable tannin. Paiches with an average weight of 12.0 kg were used, skins were made and tanned using chromium and vegetable tannin as techniques. After tanning, 20 specimens were removed in longitudinal, transverse and diagonal directions to the fish body, to determine resistance in dynamometer and leather for histological analysis, scanning electron microscopy and physical-chemical analysis. The average thickness of the specimens of the leathers ranged 1.79mm to 2.82mm, in addition, there was no interaction between the type of tanning agent and the directions obtained for strength, traction and elongation. Regarding the progressive tearing test, there was also no interaction effect. However, the defined factors had relevant differences for the maximum and average amount applied, and the leathers tanned with vegetable tannin expanded to larger dimensions 110.19 and 85.52 N. According to the images obtained by histology and scanning microscopy, they presented that in the longitudinal and transverse direction the collagen fibers are presented in layers parallel to the leather surface and in the diagonal direction the interlacing is more intense, that is, in addition to the overlapping layers intercalated thinner, close to the surface, fiber bundles can also be seen crossing each other. It is concluded that leathers tanned with vegetable tannin have less resistance than leathers tanned with chromium salts for traction to rupture and greater resistance to tear."
https://openalex.org/W4206921189,"Although African Americans have lower rates of anxiety in childhood than other racial and ethnic minority groups, they seem to experience escalating rates during emerging adulthood. Despite this, few studies have examined factors associated with anxiety during emerging adulthood among African American populations. The current study investigated the extent to which late adolescent family relationships affect anxiety problems among African American emerging adults. Informed by family development theory, family cohesion was hypothesized to indirectly effect anxiety problems through self-regulation. This model was tested with three waves of data (ages 17, 19, 21) from African Americans participating in the Maryland Adolescent Development in Context Study. Study findings were consistent with the hypothesized model: family cohesion forecasted decreased anxiety problems, indirectly, via increased self-regulation. This finding suggests that families may be an important promotive process for anxiety problems during emerging adulthood. Prevention programs that target family processes may be able to reduce anxiety problems in emerging adult African Americans."
https://openalex.org/W4206966233,"Completing the genotype-to-phenotype map requires rigorous measurement of the entire multivariate organismal phenotype. However, phenotyping on a large scale is not feasible for many kinds of traits, resulting in missing data that can also cause problems for comparative analyses and the assessment of evolutionary trends across species. Measuring the multivariate performance phenotype is especially logistically challenging, and our ability to predict several performance traits from a given morphology is consequently poor. We developed a machine learning model to accurately estimate multivariate performance data from morphology alone by training it on a dataset containing performance and morphology data from 68 lizard species. Our final, stacked model predicts missing performance data accurately at the level of the individual from simple morphological measures. This model performed exceptionally well, even for performance traits that were missing values for &gt;90% of the sampled individuals. Furthermore, incorporating phylogeny did not improve model fit, indicating that the phenotypic data alone preserved sufficient information to predict the performance based on morphological information. This approach can both significantly increase our understanding of performance evolution and act as a bridge to incorporate performance into future work on phenomics."
https://openalex.org/W4225985764,"Sequencing-based protocols for studying the human microbiome have unearthed a wealth of information about the relationship between the microbiome and human health. But these microbes cannot be leveraged as therapeutic targets without culture-based studies to phenotype species of interest and to establish culture collections for use in animal models. Traditional sample collection protocols are focused on preserving nucleic acids and metabolites and are largely inappropriate for preserving sensitive anaerobic bacteria for later culture recovery. Here we introduce a novel microbiome preservation kit (BIOME-Preserve) that facilitates recovery of anaerobic bacteria from human stool. Using a combination of culture recovery and shallow whole-genome shotgun sequencing, we characterized the anaerobes cultured from fresh human stool and from human stool held at room temperature in BIOME-Preserve for up to 120 hours. We recovered several species of interest to microbiome researchers, including Bifidobacterium spp., Bacteroides spp., Blautia spp., Eubacterium halii (now Anaerobutyricum hallii), Akkermansia muciniphila, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. We also demonstrated that freezing at -80°C did not adversely affect our ability to culture organisms from BIOME-Preserve, suggesting that it is appropriate both as a transport medium and as a medium for longer-term ultra-cold storage. Together, our results suggest BIOME-Preserve is practical for the collection, transport, and culture of anaerobic bacteria from human samples and can help enable researchers to better understand the link between the microbiome and human health and how to leverage that link through novel microbiome-based therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W4205271674,"Environmental process assessment based on the environmental depletion index (EDI) is an important part of the long-term monitoring and early warning mechanism of China's resources and environmental carrying capacity. The EDI aims to realize the unified environmental impact assessment of economic and environmental systems through the ratio relationship between economic growth and pollutant emission growth. However, in terms of pollutant emissions, the EDI ignores the environmental capacity (EC), which means that the effectiveness and objectivity of environmental impact assessment must be verified. In this study, with Xinjiang as an example and based on the EDI, Sulfur dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen oxide (NOx), Chemical oxygen demand (COD) and Ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) were selected for calculation and assessment both without and with consideration of EC and for discussion of the suitability of the environmental depletion method for resources and environmental carrying capacity. The results indicated that ① the percentages of SO2, NOx, COD, NH3-N and CEDI in counties and cities that tend to be poor and lack EC were 32.98%, 29.79%, 30.85%, 28.72% and 38.30%, respectively, while the percentages in counties and cities with EC were 10.64%, 3.19%, 13.83%, 8.51% and 10.64%, respectively. ② When EC was included, the number of counties and cities where changes in SO2, NOx, COD, NH3-N and CEDI tended to be ""poor → good"" were 23, 26, 17, 21 and 28, respectively, and the number of counties and cities where such changes tended to be ""good → poor"" were 2, 1, 1, 2 and 2, respectively. ③ EC inclusion corrected overestimated or underestimated EDI results, making the evaluation results more objective and reasonable. This understanding provides a scientific reference for the coordinated development of the regional economy and environment in Xinjiang and worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W4205436893,"Human observers can rapidly perceive complex real-world scenes. Grouping visual elements into meaningful units is an integral part of this process. Yet, so far, the neural underpinnings of perceptual grouping have only been studied with simple lab stimuli. We here uncover the neural mechanisms of one important perceptual grouping cue, local parallelism. Using a new, image-computable algorithm for detecting local symmetry in line drawings and photographs, we manipulated the local parallelism content of real-world scenes. We decoded scene categories from patterns of brain activity obtained via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 38 human observers while they viewed the manipulated scenes. Decoding was significantly more accurate for scenes containing strong local parallelism compared to weak local parallelism in the parahippocampal place area (PPA), indicating a central role of parallelism in scene perception. To investigate the origin of the parallelism signal we performed a model-based fMRI analysis of the public BOLD5000 dataset, looking for voxels whose activation time course matches that of the locally parallel content of the 4916 photographs viewed by the participants in the experiment. We found a strong relationship with average local symmetry in visual areas V1-4, PPA, and retrosplenial cortex (RSC). Notably, the parallelism-related signal peaked first in V4, suggesting V4 as the site for extracting paralleism from the visual input. We conclude that local parallelism is a perceptual grouping cue that influences neuronal activity throughout the visual hierarchy, presumably starting at V4. Parallelism plays a key role in the representation of scene categories in PPA."
https://openalex.org/W4205468864,"Through animal models, particularly non-obesity diabetes model (NOD), pathological understandings of human autoimmune diabetes have been gained. However, features of those mouse models and the human disease are not sufficiently analogous; it is therefore not unexpected that interventions based on the mouse data fail at an alarming rate in clinical settings. An improvised model that maximally resembles the real pathological course is highly desirable. Here we devised a ‘double-hit’ strategy, pancreas was first hit by chemical damage (streptozotocin, STZ) to unleash auto-antigens, then hit second time by transient immune-inflammation (regulatory T cell depletion). Comparing to NOD model, this strategy not only induced classical diabetic symptoms, but also depicted the crucial pathogenic features absent in conventional models, such as CD8 + T cell dominant infiltrates, strong ketoacidosis and epitope-specific T cell responses. In addition, this model allowed synchronized control of disease onset, permitting more refined temporal analysis of disease progression. We believe that this model would yield research outcomes with clinically relevant prediction power unattainable previously."

This study aimed to evaluate whether an algorithm (http://b2019.modelderm.com) improves the accuracy of nondermatologists in diagnosing skin neoplasms.A total of 285 cases (random series) with skin neoplasms suspected of malignancy by either physicians or patients were recruited in two tertiary care centers located in South Korea. An artificial intelligence (AI) group (144 cases, mean [SD] age, 57.0 [17.7] years; 62 [43.1%] men) was diagnosed via routine examination with photographic review and assistance by the algorithm, whereas the control group (141 cases, mean [SD] age, 61.0 [15.3] years; 52 [36.9%] men) was diagnosed only via routine examination with a photographic review. The accuracy of the nondermatologists before and after the interventions was compared.Among the AI group, the accuracy of the first impression (Top-1 accuracy; 58.3%) after the assistance of AI was higher than that before the assistance (46.5%, P = .008). The number of differential diagnoses of the participants increased from 1.9 ± 0.5 to 2.2 ± 0.6 after the assistance (P < .001). In the control group, the difference in the Top-1 accuracy between before and after reviewing photographs was not significant (before, 46.1%; after, 51.8%; P = .19), and the number of differential diagnoses did not significantly increase (before, 2.0 ± 0.4; after, 2.1 ± 0.5; P = .57).In real-world settings, AI augmented the diagnostic accuracy of trainee doctors. The limitation of this study is that the algorithm was tested only for Asians recruited from a single region. Additional international randomized controlled trials involving various ethnicities are required."
https://openalex.org/W4205685441,"Background The rapid advancement of mobile technology has fueled the use of mobile devices for health interventions and for improving healthcare provision in underserved communities. Despite the potential of mHealth being used as a health information and surveillance tool, its scale-up has been challenging and, in most cases, unable to advance beyond the pilot stage of implementation. The purpose of this study was to explore user experiences of a mobile phone-based interactive voice response (IVR) system among caregivers of children under-five in rural communities in the Asante Akim North District of Ghana. Methods The study adopted an exploratory design. A convenience sampling technique was used to recruit 35 participants who had used an IVR system for at least six months for the study. About 11 in-depth interviews and three focus group discussions were conducted among participants using a semi-structured interview guide. Thematic content analysis was utilized for the analysis of data in this study. Result The system was found to be acceptable, and the attitude of caregivers towards the system was also positive. The study discovered that the mobile phone-based Health Information and Surveillance System (mHISS) was useful for improving access to healthcare, communicating with health professionals, served as a decision support system, and improved caregivers’ awareness about self-management of childhood illnesses. Poor network quality, unstable electricity power supply, and dropped/cut calls served as significant barriers to using the mHISS system. Conclusion The mHISS system was generally acceptable and could help improve access to healthcare and identify children with severe health conditions during outbreaks of diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4206222248,"Chrysomelidae is one of the most diverse lineages of beetles. The classification and phylogeny of Chrysomelidae have been contentious. In this study, we obtained 16 new mitogenome sequences by using next-generation sequencing. Combined with the published mitogenomes, we inferred the phylogenetic relationships of Chrysomelidae. Different data recoding strategies and substitution models were applied to phylogenetic reconstruction. In the Maximum likelihood analyses under the homogeneous model, Dayhoff recoding allowed for the improved phylogenetic resolution due to the decreased level of heterogeneous sequence divergence. Bayesian inference under the heterogeneous model yielded generally well resolved subfamily relationships. The present mitogenome data strongly supported Chrysomelidae as a monophyletic group. Consistent with previous work, we found three major subfamily clades within Chrysomelidae. However, the pattern of the ""sagrine"" clade plus the ""eumolpine"" clade being sister to the ""chrysomeline"" clade contrasted with the prior study. The placement of the genus Syneta with regards to these three clades was ambiguous. Relationships recovered suggested several major chrysomelid lineages, including: (1) Bruchinae in the ""sagrine"" clade; (2) Donaciinae + Criocerinae; (3) Spilopyrinae + (Cassidinae + (Eumolpinae + (Lamprosomatinae + Cryptocephalinae))); (4) Chrysomelinae + (Alticinae + Galerucinae).

In terms of capacity building activities, participants found the lecture series, both real time and virtual, to be helpful. Finally, participants pointed out that the FRRP program should be mandatory.To provide residents and clinical fellows with a supervised and structured research experience, we have built on our findings to introduce several changes to our program such as ensuring the availability and commitment of faculty mentors, and providing capacity building activities to the program participants."
https://openalex.org/W4206421951,"Background Clinical outcome of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) has been predominantly focused on the reoccurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and the maintenance of sinus rhythm. However, there has been a limited intermediate follow-up on health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) of patients. Given the relatively high recurrence rate of persistent AF after PVI treatment, it is important to follow up with clinical outcomes on symptom improvement as well as health-related quality-of-life. This study was designed to investigate the recurrence rate of atrial tachyarrhythmia (ATa), AF-related symptoms and HRQoL after PVI in patients with persistent AF who were treated with the second generation cryoballoon. Methods Total 148 patients participated in the study who were treated by PVI between 2013 and 2017 for persistent AF. All patients visited the out-patient clinic 2–5 years after PVI. During this visit all patients filled-out an AF Effect on Quality-of-life (AFEQT) questionnaire and a seven-day Holter was applied. All rhythm recordings acquired post ablation were collected and analysed, and the modified European Heart Rhythm Association score (mEHRA) scores were calculated before and after the ablation. Results The average age of patients was 63±9 year old and 44 (27.9%) were female. Mean CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score was 1.9±1.4, and moderate and severe left atrial (LA) dilation was present in 53 (36.1%) and 15 (10.2%) patients, respectively. After a follow-up of 3.7±1.0 years, 81 (54.7%) patients had an ATa recurrence and 35 (23.6%) patients underwent a repeat LA ablation. However, the mEHRA score significantly improved in 80.4% of the patients ( p &lt;0.001), with the median overall AFEQT score of 88.9 [70.4–97.2]. Conclusions There is a considerable ATa recurrence rate after PVI of persistent AF at intermediate-term follow-up. However, our data indicate that PVI significantly improved AF-related symptoms and resulted in a high HRQoL for 2–5 years in patients with persistent AF."

An electronic search for original articles published before May 2020 was performed using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Independent reviewers conducted the article screening and data extraction. We used the generic inverse variance method for the meta-analysis, and Begg's rank correlation test and Egger's regression test to assess publication bias. A total of 1,148 cases of H. pylori infection and 1,231 uninfected controls were included from 13 studies. H. pylori infection had no significant association with esophageal varices [relative risk (RR) = 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.87-1.06 for all selected studies; RR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.84-1.07 for cohort studies; odds ratio (OR) = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.60-1.54 for case-control studies].

However, the mechanism behind these effects is not fully understood. To clarify the effects of miso on immune cells, we evaluated its immunomodulatory activity in mice. Miso did not alter the percentage of B and T cells in the spleen; however, it increased CD69 + B cells, germinal center B cells and regulatory T cells. Anti-DNA immunoglobulin M antibodies, which prevent autoimmune disease, were increased following ingestion of miso. Transcriptome analysis of mouse spleen cells cultured with miso and its raw material revealed that the expression of genes, including interleukin (IL)-10, IL-22 and CD86, was upregulated. Furthermore, intravital imaging of the small intestinal epithelium using a calcium biosensor mouse line indicated that miso induced Ca 2+ signaling in a manner similar to that of probiotics. Thus, ingestion of miso strengthened the immune response and tolerance in mice. These results appear to account, at least in part, to the salubrious effects of miso."

Our objective was to evaluate in early 2020 the rate of French hospitalists declaring having prescribed HCQ to treat covid-19 patients outside any therapeutic trial, compare the reasons and the determinants for having prescribed HCQ or not.A national inquiry submitted by email from May 7 to 25, 2020, to a sample of French hospitalists: doctors managing patients hospitalized for covid-19 in a French department of internal medicine or infectious diseases and identified in the directories of French hospitals or as a member of the French Infectious Diseases Society (SPILF). Primary outcome was the percentage of hospitalists declaring having prescribed HCQ to covid-19 patients. Secondary outcomes were reasons and determinants of HCQ prescription.Among 400 (22.8%) responding hospitalists, 45.3% (95% CI, 40.4 to 50.1%) declared having prescribed HCQ to covid-19 patients. Two main profiles were discerned: HCQ prescribers who did not raise its efficacy as a motive, and non-prescribers who based their decision on evidence-based medicine. Multivariate analysis retained the following prescription determinants (adjusted odds ratio; 95% confidence interval): a departmental procedure for HCQ prescription (8.25; 4.79 to 14.20), having prescribed other treatments outside a therapeutic trial (3.21; 1.81 to 5.71), prior HCQ prescription (2.75; 1.5 to 5.03) and HCQ prescribed within the framework of a therapeutic trial (0.56; 0.33 to 0.95).Almost half of the hospitalists prescribed HCQ. The physician's personality (questioning or not evidence-based-medicine principles in the context of the pandemic) and departmental therapeutic procedures were the main factors influencing HCQ prescription. Establishment of ""therapeutic"" procedures represents a potential means to improve the quality of therapeutic decision-making during a pandemic."

The role of orally administered antibiotic treatment (ABX) on viral transmission, GIT microbial dysbiosis and subsequent pathogenesis of Moloney Murine Leukemia virus-temperature sensitive 1 (ts1) on BALB/c mice were studied. BALB/c mice were divided into four groups: ABXts1-Treatment/Infection;ABX-Treatment/No infection;ts1-No treatment/Infection;Ctrl (control)-No treatment/No infection. ABXts1 and ABX groups showed a significant phylogenetic shift (ANOSIM p-value = 0.001) in alpha and beta diversity comparisons for microbial community composition compared to Ctrl group. Mice in the ABXts1 and ABX groups showed megacolon compared to ts1 and Ctrl groups; ABXts1 and ts1 groups showed hepatosplenomegaly, thymus enlargement, and mesenteric lymphadenopathy compared to ABX and Ctrl groups. Ctrl group had no abnormal manifestations. ABX treatment and ts1 infection uniquely affect microbial community when compared to control: ABXts1 and ABX groups significantly reduce microbiome diversity by over 80% and ts1 group by over 30%. ABXts1 and ts1 groups' viral load and clinical manifestations of infection were comparable; antibiotic treatment did not notably affect ts1 infection. Transmission and pathophysiology of ts1 infection were not significantly altered by the microbial composition of the GI tract, but ts1 viral infection did result in microbial dysbiosis independent of antibiotic treatment."

Moreover, SPR analysis indicated the Kd (4.75, 1.21, and 4.0 nM) levels of TKY2.T1.13, TKY.T2.08, TKY.T2.09 putative X-aptamers, respectively.Our results illustrate the synthesis of 24 putative X-aptamers against both GHRH NH2 (1-44) and NH2 (1-29) peptides and TKY1.T1.13, TKY.T2.08, TKY.T2.09 X-aptamers have high serum stability, high target binding potential with low Kd levels."
https://openalex.org/W4205734252,"While cooperation and risk aversion are considered to be evolutionarily advantageous in many circumstances, and selfish or risky behaviour can bring negative consequences for individuals and the community at large, selfish and risk-seeking behaviour is still often observed in human societies. In this paper we consider whether there are environmental and social conditions that favour selfish risk-seeking individuals within a community and whether tolerating such individuals may provide benefits to the community itself in some circumstances. We built an agent-based model including two types of agent—selfish risk-seeking and generous risk-averse—that harvest resources from the environment and share them (or not) with their community. We found that selfish risk-seekers can outperform generous risk-averse agents in conditions where their survival is moderately challenged, supporting the theory that selfish and risk-seeking traits combined are not dysfunctional but rather can be evolutionarily advantageous for agents. The benefit for communities is less clear, but when generous agents are unconditionally cooperative communities with a greater proportion of selfish risk-seeking agents grow to a larger population size suggesting some advantage to the community overall."

The performance of the algorithm is studied, and it is shown that the algorithm is capable of removing high-frequency noise. Useful information can be extracted more easily by this method, and the Hilbert phase unwrapping displacement reconstructions method based on this algorithm has been experimentally validated. The experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the frequency separation performance in experiments, and is robust against noise interference."

Analysis of fatty acid composition in blood vessels is important in understanding the development of atherosclerosis. Here, analyses of fatty acid profiles in major arteries which are commonly used in Coronary Artery Bypass Graft surgery (CABG) were subjected to investigation. Patients (n = 27) undergoing elective CABG were enrolled in the study. A small biopsy segment of the saphenous vein (SV), radial artery (RA), and left internal mammary artery (LIMA) of patients was obtained during the surgery. The fatty acid (FA) profile of tissue samples was analyzed using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GCMS). Among the different arteries tested, palmitic acid and stearic acid were the predominant fatty acids. As far as monounsaturated FA (MUFA) are concerned, oleic acid was found to be the most abundant MUFA in vessels. The FA profile of LIMA samples had a higher SFA percentage and lower unsaturated FA percentage compared to other vessels. Furthermore, the vessel samples of RA indicated the highest percentage of pro-inflammatory ω -6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) as well as a higher percentage ratio between ω -6: ω -3 PUFA. The fatty acid composition and ω -6: ω -3 PUFA ratio suggests that LIMA graft is preferred for CABG over RA and SV."

Young C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups (8 to 10 mice per group): Control group: mice with no intervention; antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) group: mice sensitized and immunized with intra-articular (i.a.) injection of methylated bovine serum albumin (mBSA); and AIA + cryotherapy group: mice sensitized, immunized with i.a. injection of mBSA, and submitted to a clinical-like cryotherapy protocol. After 21 days of sensitization, AIA and AIA + cryotherapy groups received i.a. injection of mBSA (100 μg/joint) to induce joint inflammation, and a clinical-like cryotherapy protocol was applied to AIA + cryotherapy group (crushed ice bag, two cryotherapy sessions of 20 min every two hours). Experimental analysis was conducted in the initial (immediately after i.a. injection of mBSA) and final periods (two hours after the second cryotherapy session). The number of synovial fluid neutrophils, cytokine levels, joint histology, pain, joint swelling, and motor performance were also analyzed. Our results showed that clinical-like cryotherapy in mice with acute knee arthritis reduced inflammatory signs, pain, and joint swelling, and improved balance and motor coordination."

It has been hypothesised that this may be ameliorated by encouraging people to focus on channels of expression other than the face. This was tested in a web-based study of 466 participants. Participants in the Trained Condition received tips for perceiving expressiveness in individuals with FP, while those in the Untrained Condition received general medical information about FP. We observed no significant differences between groups for accuracy of emotion recognition, but a significant effect of the training upon perception of emotional intensity. These results show that attending to non-facial cues may improve social perception and reduce bias."
