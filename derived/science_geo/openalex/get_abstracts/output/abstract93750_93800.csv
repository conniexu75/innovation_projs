https://openalex.org/W2020847620,"Axonal transport studies and biochemical fractionation have led to the concept that the three 'triplet' proteins [approximate molecular weights 200,000 (200K), 145,000 (145K) and 68,000 (68K)] are the essential components of mammalian neurofilaments. Using a correlated biochemical and immunological approach, we have now shown that the 200K protein is under separate developmental control during rat brain differentiation and that the time of its expression differs in different regions. We were unable to detect 200K protein by immunofluorescence or in total brain filament preparations from prenatal rat brain, although the 145K and 68K proteins are both present in an apparently identical distribution. During development, progressively more 145K- and 68K-positive neurofilamentous bundles can be stained with 200K antibodies, paralleling the increasing quantities of this protein detected biochemically in brain filament preparations. We conclude that 200K protein probably has a more specialized role in neurofilament architecture and function than the other two triplet proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2025232112,"A mutant allele of the chromosomal locus corresponding to the cloned actin gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been constructed by DNA transformation with a hybrid plasmid which integrates into, and thereby disrupts, the protein-encoding sequences of the gene. In a diploid strain of yeast, disruption of the actin gene on one chromosome results in a mutation that segregates as a recessive lethal tightly linked to a selectable genetic marker on the integrated plasmid. The actin gene, therefore, must encode an essential function for yeast cell growth."

https://openalex.org/W1510960581,"The recA protein of Escherichia coli promotes the complete exchange of strands between full length linear duplex and single-stranded circular DNA molecules. An early step in this reaction consists of the binding of recA protein to single-stranded DNA. In the presence of ATP and the single-stranded DNA binding protein, recA protein and single-stranded DNA interact to form a complex whose stability depends upon the single-stranded DNA binding protein. Duplex DNA is not required for complex formation. Subsequent steps occur within this complex which contains up to 1 recA protein monomer per 2 nucleotides of single-stranded DNA. Although several hundred ATPs are hydrolyzed per recA protein monomer, recA protein is not released from the complex at any step during or subsequent to strand exchange. The complex is kinetically competent with respect to both its rate of formation and its rate of reaction with homologous duplex DNA. It is therefore a significant intermediate in the overall reaction pathway. These results have served as the basis for an expanded model for recA protein-promoted strand exchange."
https://openalex.org/W1510322316,"We have successfully established 16 stable murine hybridomas that secrete monoclonal antibodies specific for human DNA polymerase alpha. The results of immunocytochemical studies, using 4 of these monoclonal antibodies and immunoperoxidase detection methods, document the exclusively intranuclear localization of DNA polymerase alpha in three separate lines of cultured human cells. By light microscopy, the immunoperoxidase reaction product exhibits a diffuse pattern of distribution within the nucleoplasm, but nucleoli are clearly negative. In cultures of the transformed lines, KB nd BeWo, more than 955 of the cells are positive, suggesting that intranuclear DNA polymerase alpha antigens persist throughout the mitotic cycle. In striking contrast, in the normal diploid fibroblast line, WI-38, a smaller fraction of the cultured cells is positive, and there is no detectable polymerase alpha antigen in the closely apposed cells of microcolonies that are presumed to be contact-arrested and no longer mitotically cycling. In cells in mitosis that have dissolved their nuclear envelopes (and are thus transiently anucleate), the anti-polymerase alpha reaction continues to be strongly positive, and in this single circumstance the reaction product is diffusely distributed throughout the cell cytoplasm. Initial electron microscopic examination of KB cells confirms and extends these observations. The immunoperoxidase reaction product is essentially limited to the nuclear compartment and is predominantly distributed in the midzonal region of the nucleoplasm between centrally disposed nucleoli and peripherally located blocks of condensed chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1499155864,"Cell-free extracts prepared from whole yeast cells carry out selective and accurate transcription, in vitro, of purified yeast class III genes. Both 5 S rRNA and tRNA genes are specifically transcribed by DNA-dependent RNA polymerase III present in these whole cell extracts. These extracts also appear to carry out nucleolytic processing of the in vitro synthesized transcripts. Optimal conditions for specific class III gene transcription in vitro are defined. Initial fractionation of the yeast extract has indicated that multiple chromatographically separable factors (fractions) are required, in addition to RNA polymerase III, for specific in vitro transcription of class III genes."

https://openalex.org/W1543719240,"The addition of platelet-activating factor to horse platelets prelabeled with (32P)orthophosphate induces the rapid formation of [32P]phosphatidic acid. This is subsequently followed by a considerable increase in the labeling of phosphatidylinositol. Activation of the formation of phosphatidic acid by platelet-activating factor is evident at a concentration of 1 nM, is maximal at 0.1 microM, and independent of the presence or absence of plasma in the medium. In horse platelets prelabeled with [14C]arachidonic acid, platelet-activating factor stimulates the rapid formation of [14C]phosphatidic acid, [14C]arachidonic acid, and [14C]arachidonate metabolites. Concomitantly, there is a loss of radioactivity from phosphatidylinostiol., phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine. Platelet-activating factor at a concentration of 1 nM stimulates formation of phosphatidic acid while the appearance of arachidonate metabolites is seen at a higher concentration (10 nM), without acetate in the 2-position, is unable to induce in platelets the formation of phosphatidic acid, arachidonate metabolites, or the release of [3H]serotonin and, in addition, does not antagonize the action of platelet-activating factor. the release of [3H]serotonin and [14C]arachidonate from platelets stimulated with platelet-activating factor is not affected by indomethacin. Trifluoperazine (50-100 microM) inhibits the platelet-activating factor-stimulated liberation of arachidonic acid from phospholipids, without affecting the formation of phosphatidic acid and the release of serotonin. Prostacyclin, on the other hand, inhibits the platelet-activating factor-induced release of serotonin, arachidonate metabolites, and formation of phosphatidic acid. These data indicate a close relationship between the formation of phosphatidic acid and the release of serotonin in platelets stimulated with the platelet-activating factor."

https://openalex.org/W1554324315,"Rabbit skeletal muscle calcium-dependent protease which requires millimolar Ca2+ concentration for activity is a dimer composed of Mr = 73,000 and 30,000 subunits. The subunit structure has been confirmed by co-elution of the two polypeptide bands on Sephadex G-200 chromatography, and by cross-linking the enzyme with dimethyl suberimidate followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-disc gel electrophoresis. Preincubation of the enzyme with p-chloromercuribenzoate prior to nondenaturing electrophoresis resulted in dissociation of the subunits. The rabbit muscle calcium-dependent protease was rapidly inactivated when incubated in the presence of 6 mM Ca2+. The half-life of protease activity at 30 degrees C was independent of protease concentrations over the range of 0.005 to 0.272 mg/ml. The rate of inactivation was not affected by a 270-fold molar excess of a substrate protein succinylated lysozyme. Protease activity also rapidly decreased (t1/2 = 8.4 min) during the assay at 37 degrees C as determined by a decrease in linearity of the time course when substrate was limiting. The rate of protease inactivation during the assay was essentially the same as that observed when the protease was incubated at 37 degrees C in the absence of substrate (t1/2 = 7.2 min). The addition of either leupeptin or the calcium-dependent protease inhibitor protein from dog heart prevented protease inactivation. The protease displayed an increase in activity during the time course of autoproteolysis at 30 degrees C when activity was measured in the presence of 0.2 mM Ca2+ instead of 5 mM Ca2+."

https://openalex.org/W1523753692,"To determine how the carbohydrate moiety of fibronectin influences the susceptibility of protein to proteolytic degradation, we compared the effects of various proteases on glycosylated and nonglycosylated fibronectins. Nonglycosylated fibronectin, from tunicamycin-treated chicken embryo fibroblasts, was degraded more rapidly to acid-soluble products than glycosylated fibronectin by pronase, thermolysin, trypsin, and chymotrypsin. The absence of carbohydrate did not markedly affect overall patterns of proteolytic fragments identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Except for the expected increases in electrophoretic mobilities of the nonglycosylated peptides, the only important difference was that of the nonglycosylated fragment corresponding to the carbohydrate-rich, collagen-binding domain, was completely digested by the proteases in 60 min at 30 degrees C. In contrast, the comparable fragment from glycosylated fibronectin was resistant to protease digestion. Heparin-binding domains that normally lack carbohydrate are equally susceptible to proteases in glycosylated and nonglycosylated fibronectin. We conclude that the carbohydrate component of fibronectin plays an important role in the stabilization of a specific domain of the protein against proteolytic degradation; however, the carbohydrate does not alter overall proteolytic specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1534171724,"As part of a genetic analysis of the in vivo folding and subunit assembly of the P22 tail spike endorhamnosidase, we have studied the maturation of the newly synthesized 76,000-dalton polypeptide chains into thermostable tail spike oligomers. Four of 15 temperature-sensitive mutations in the structural gene for this protein result in electrophoretically distinct tail spikes. Cells mixedly infected with wild type and an electrophoretic variant produce two hybrid species, with mobilities intermediate between the parental species, indicating that the native tail spike is a trimer. Mature trimers are resistant to denaturation by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS): at room temperature the trimer migrates in an SDS gel as if it were not binding significant amounts of SDS, whereas the heat-denatured chain migrates as expected of an SDS-polypeptide complex. The mature trimer is also resistant to trypsin digestion. Lysates of infected cells contain SDS and trypsin-sensitive forms of the newly synthesized tail spike polypeptide chains. These are probably incompletely or incorrectly folded chains. SDS and trypsin resistance were used to measure the efficiency of in vivo folding and subunit assembly of the mature trimer from its polypeptide chains. This decreased from 90% at 27 degrees C to only 15% at 42 degrees C. These results are consistent with the existence or a labile intermediate or step in the folding or subunit assembly of the thermostable tail spike protein. We discuss the possibility that the achievement of certain structural features of mature proteins may entail difficulties in their folding pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1564432135,"A terminal oxidase of the Escherichia coli K12 respiratory chain (cytochrome b562-o complex) was reconstituted into liposomes by freeze-thaw/sonication method. Formation of a membrane potential (-145 mV) by the reconstituted cytochrome b562-o complex was observed with the fluorescent dye 3,3'-dipropylthiodicarbocyanine iodide on addition of an artificial electron donor ubiquinol-1 or ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate. The membrane potential formed was inhibited by the protonophore uncouplers 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzylidenemalononitrile, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, and carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, and the inhibitors of the oxidase system zinc sulfate, potassium cyanide, and 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide. This is the first indication that there is a coupling site in an E. coli terminal oxidase, which consists of b-type cytochromes."

https://openalex.org/W1577739031,"T4 DNA polymerase copolymerizes the SP isomers of 2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-O-(1-thiotriphosphate) and 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphate) with dTTP onto a poly(d(A-T) template in the presence of various metal ions. The corresponding RP diastereomers are inactive, independent of the metal ion used. The polymer resulting from the polymerization of the SP diastereomer of 2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-O-(1-thiotriphosphate) and dTTP can be degraded by the 5' leads to 3' exonuclease activity of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and alkaline phosphatase (Brody, R. S., and Frey, P. A. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 1245-1252) to d(Tp(S)A). This material has the RP configuration as determined by comparison with the RP and SP diastereomers obtained by chemical synthesis and preparative separation by high performance liquid chromatography. This result indicates inversion of configuration at the alpha-phosphorus in the nucleotidyl transfer reaction and is compatible with the absence of a covalent enzyme intermediate."

https://openalex.org/W1600851217,"Glucocorticoids increase the number of insulin receptors in cultured human lymphocytes. This effect is specific for the insulin receptor as growth hormone receptor concentration decreases. The effect is time-dependent, dose-dependent over the physiologic concentration range of glucocorticoid, reversible, and appears to be mediated via specific glucocorticoid receptors. Protein synthesis and glycosylation are required as the effect is inhibited by actinomycin D, puromycin, cycloheximide, and tunicamycin. Isolated solubilized plasma membranes, as well as solubilized whole cells from glucocorticoid-treated lymphocytes, show the same increase in insulin receptors as do intact cells. The glucocorticoid-induced receptors are immunologically indistinguishable from control when precipitated by anti-receptor antibody. Glucocorticoids do not stabilize existing receptors since the degradation rate of receptors is actually increased. Regulation of the insulin receptor by insulin is independent of the steroid effect. However, there is a right-ward shift of the dose-response curve for down regulation by insulin in the presence of glucocorticoid. We conclude that glucocorticoids increase the number of insulin receptors in cultured human lymphocytes by increasing the synthesis of new receptors. This represents the first induction of insulin receptor synthesis by a pharmacologic agent."

https://openalex.org/W1501000377,"Trypanosoma cruzi cells, the causative agent of Chagas disease, incubated with [U-14C]glucose in the presence of 5 mM sodium pyruvate or 5.5 mM glucose, were found to synthesize Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol as the main and largest dolichol disphosphate derivative. No traces of glucosylated derivatives or of dolichol-bound oligosaccharides with a size larger than that of a Man9GlcNAc2 standard could be detected in any case. The synthesis of mannose-P-dolichol but not that of glucose-P-dolichol was found to occur in vivo in these cells. The inability to synthesize glucose-P-dolichol may explain the absence of glucosylated dolichol diphosphate derivatives. The lipid moiety of the dolichol derivatives appeared to have about 13 isoprene residues, the first of which was saturated."
https://openalex.org/W1492715894,"The rapid mixing-photocrosslinking technique, in conjunction with an immunoprecipitation assay developed to measure the change in the distribution of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase molecules bound to T7 DNA, has been applied to investigate the molecular mechanism of promoter search by RNA polymerase. The binding of RNA polymerase to the DNA template can be divided into at least two steps. The initial binding is rapid and occurs at nonspecific sites randomly distributed throughout the DNA molecule. This is followed by a relatively slow promoter search in which RNA polymerase is transferred from nonspecific sites to promoter sites through a series of intramolecular processes. The rate of polymerase loss from a segment of DNA which does not contain promoter sites is a function of the distance from this segment to both the promoter sites and the ends of the DNA molecule. The kinetic data are consistent with a molecular mechanism in which RNA polymerase undergoes a bidirectional linear diffusion along the DNA template to search for the promoter site. This interpretation is supported by the computer simulation which correctly predicts the relative rates of polymerase loss from various DNA segments. The mechanism derived from these studies is in accordance with the notion that the whole DNA molecule serves as an effective sink for trapping and guiding polymerase molecules during promoter search."

https://openalex.org/W1489184797,"The protein-bound oligosaccharides were isolated from Trypanosoma cruzi cells incubated with [U-14C]glucose by means of as proteolytic digestion of delipidated proteinaceous pellets, followed by separation of oligosaccharides from glycopeptides through incubation with endo-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. The saccharides obtained after very short incubation periods were tentatively identified as Glc1Man9GlcNAc, Glc1Man8GlcNAc and Glc1Man7GlcNAc and the label was almost exclusively present in the glucose residues. On longer incubations, however, two more labeled oligosaccharides could be isolated, Man9GlcNAc (which appeared first) and Man9GlcNAc. The relative proportion of the three glucose-containing saccharides did not change with the length of the incubation of cells with [U-14C]glucose nor after chasing the label with the unlabeled monosaccharide. Moreover, the more internal mannose residues were labeled before in Man9GlcNAc than in Glc1Man9GlcNAc.l All this evidence indicated that Glc1Man9GlcNAc was not an intermediate in the formation of the other saccharides. On the basis of these results and of those reported in the preceding paper, the following pathway is proposed for the first stages of protein glycosylation: (formula, see text)."

https://openalex.org/W2154628287,"Inosine peripherally administered to rats markedly suppressed spontaneous food intake and food intake induced by diazepam, muscimol, insulin, and food deprivation. The purines 2-deoxyguanosine and 2-deoxyinosine also suppressed food deprivation-induced feeding, whereas 7-methylinosine, which does not bind to the benzodiazepine binding site in vitro, had no effect on food intake when compared with controls. These results suggest that purines may represent endogenous substances that regulate food intake through interactions with the benzodiazepine receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1583099628,"A combined rapid mixing-photocrosslinking technique has been developed to investigate the kinetics of the interaction between Escherichia coli RNA polymerase and T7 DNA. The reactants were rapidly mixed in a modified Durrum stopped-flow apparatus, and the intermediates formed at different stages of the binding process were frozen by photocrosslinking with a UV light pulse of 10-mus duration at various times after mixing. The results indicate that the initial binding between RNA polymerase and T7 DNA is a diffusion-controlled reaction. Furthermore, the extents of initial contracts with DNA made with the beta, beta', and sigma subunits of RNA polymerase are roughly proportional to the sizes of these subunits, suggesting that complex formation occurs through random collision between the two reactants. After the initial complex formation, the rate of transfer of polymerase between individual DNA molecules is slow, implying that the polymerase molecules are undergoing predominantly intramolecular transfer during the promoter search. From the kinetic studies of subunit-DNA contacts during RNA polymerase binding to T7 DNA, it can be inferred that the beta, beta', and sigma subunits are directly participating in the promoter search process."

https://openalex.org/W1483543064,"Using isotope dilution-mass spectrometry, it was shown that human bile contains significant amount of 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, an intermediate in the major pathway for bile acid biosynthesis. In bile from 14 healthy subjects, the concentration was 0.14 +/- 0.01 micrograms/ml (mean +/- S.E.). Four bile samples collected from two patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis contained considerably higher amounts of this steroid, 0.47-1.32 micrograms/ml. After oral administration of [4-14C]7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one to rabbits, 14C-labeled cholestanol could be isolated from the intestinal wall, liver, and blood after 24 h. The label incorporated into the intestinal wall was about 10% of that obtained with [4-14C]cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one or [4-14C]4-cholesten-3-one as precursors. Labeled cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one and 4-cholesten-3-one could be isolated from the intestinal contents 12 h after feeding [4-14C]7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one to rabbits. It is proposed that cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one and 4-cholesten-3-one are formed from 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one by the same mechanism as that involved in 7 alpha-dehydroxylation of primary bile acids. We suggest that biliary 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one may be a physiological precursor to cholestanol. The possibility is discussed that part of the increased formation of cholestanol in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is due to excess biliary 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one or some metabolite of this steroid."

https://openalex.org/W1770357490,"A model is presented to study quantitative the effect of pH on a ligand-receptor interaction. Assuming that binding is only possible if all the are in the correct ionic state, and that the ionic state of the other residues does not affect the association constant, it is possible to measure the number and pK values of the active groups. This model is applied to insulin and insulin analogs binding to its cellular receptor. Two active groups are responsible for the marked pH dependence of the reaction: a deprotonated residue of pK 7.6 at 25 degrees C (ionization heat: 1.5 kcal . mol-1) and a protonated residue of pK 8.0 at 25 degrees C (ionization heat: 12 kcal . mol-1). The first active group might be a carboxyl residue, in a hydrophobic environment, probably belonging to the receptor molecule. The second active group was further identified as the A1 alpha-amino residue of insulin by the study of insulin analogs."
https://openalex.org/W1597579457,"The enzymatic synthesis of the o-succinylbenzoic acid is described and the factors controlling its formation are investigated. Tritium-labeled coenzyme A is incorporated into o-succinylbenzoic acid, but label from [2-3H]ATP or [gamma-32P is not, indicating that the active compound is a coenzyme A thio ester(2). The compound is shown by two different methods to contain 1 mol only of coenzyme A per mol of o-succinylbenzoic acid. The o-succinylbenzoic and coenzyme A ester (2) is unstable at alkaline and neutral pH, but is fairly stable under acid conditions. The coenzyme A ester (2) is converted to 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (3) by enzyme preparations from Mycobacterium phlei and Escherichia coli without any cofactor requirement."

Leukemic marrow was treated in vitro with antiserum and complement and used to hematologically reconstitute mice that had been irradiated with doses lethal to bone marrow. Following infusion of treated leukemic marrow, normal marrow returned without evidence of leukemia. More than 90 percent of the animals have survived for 11 months without untoward effects, suggesting that the technique may be of use in the treatment of acute leukemia in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1523930641,"The methylation of glutamic acid residues on 3 membrane proteins, MCPI, MCPII, and MCPIII, plays an essential role in the chemotactic response of Escherichia coli. In the absence of a chemotactic stimulus the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) are methylated to a basal level. This level rises to a new plateau when an attractant is added and then falls to its original basal value when the attractant is removed. We have now been able to show that the properties of the glutamic acid residues which become methylated after stimulation with an attractant differ from the properties of the residues methylated on the basal level. Our data imply that there is a preferred order in which those residues are methylated and demethylated."

Full length transcripts were synthesized in the presence of [gamma-S]GTP which indicated that capping could be dissociated from the process of transcription. Exogenous [gamma-S]GTP was not cleaved by the virion-associated phosphohydrolase and the majority of transcripts contained triphosphorylated 5'-termini. [gamma-S]GTP did, however, act as a donor for the capping of RNA chains initiated with GTP. Chromatography on mercury-agarose of products initiated with [gamma-S]GTP resulted in the binding of only the small (14 S) size class of RNA, although transcripts not bound to the affinity column were also thiophosphorylated."

Subsequent studies of specimens lightly stained with uranyl acetate have added information on the location of regions that preferentially bind uranyl ions and may represent surface RNA. The model is an elongated cone-shaped structure 180-200 A long and is divided into identifiable sections: a head partly encircled by a collar-like structure, a middle section carrying a 20-A protuberance, and a A groove separates the middle section from the tail. Uranyl-binding regions can be seen on the protuberance and the collar's ridge, in two bands below the collar and parallel to it, and in a patch on the back of the head. The staining technique described may offer a method for mapping the external nucleic acid of nucleoprotein complexes."

Liposomes were utilized as a model system to determined possible effects of membrane association on acrosin's enzymatic activity. By comparison with solubilized enzyme, liposome-bound acrosin had a substantial reduction in the apparent affinity for progressive inhibitors such as leupeptin, lima bean trypsin inhibitor, soy bean trypsin inhibitor, and for a proteinase inhibitor from sperm extracts. In contrast, the liposome-bound and -solubilized enzymes were essentially identical with respect to the binding of benzamidine and p-aminobenzamidine which are competitive acrosin inhibitors. These results suggest membrane association can influence some but not all of acrosin's enzymatic properties."
