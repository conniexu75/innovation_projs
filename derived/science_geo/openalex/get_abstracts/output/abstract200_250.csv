https://openalex.org/W2161595876,"The three purified proteins which are required for microsomal stearyl-CoA desaturation, NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase, cytochrome b5, and desaturase, have been combined with egg lecithin or dimyristyl lecithin vesicles to reconstruct a functional electron transport system capable of utilizing NADH and O2 in the desaturation of stearyl-CoA. Such preparations appear to consist of phospholipid vesicles which contain the three proteins bound to the outer surface of the vesicles. Acyl-CoA derivatives containing 12 to 19 carbon fatty acyl chains are required for desaturase activity while derivatives containing 9 to 20 carbons are capable of binding to the enzyme. Shorter chain acyl-CoA derivatives, free CoA, and free fatty acids do not appear to bind to the enzyme. Inhibition and analog studies suggest that the methylene chain of stearyl-CoA assumes an eclipsed (gauche) conformation at carbon atoms 9,10 in the enzyme-substrate complex. Furthermore, isotope rate effects obtained with deuterated stearyl-CoA derivatives indicate that hydrogen removal is the rate-limiting step of desaturation. Stearyl-CoA binds to pure liposomes and desaturase-containing liposomes, and it is this form of stearyl-CoA which appears to be the substrate for desaturase. The Arrhenius plots of desaturase activity obtained using desaturase bound to egg lecithin liposomes, in which the liquid crystalline to crystalline phase transition temperature is -5 degrees, was linear between 15 and 35 degrees, while that obtained using desaturase bound to dimyristyl lecithin liposomes showed a break at 24 degrees coinciding with the liquid crystalline to crystalline phase transition temperature for this lipid. The decrease observed in the deuterium isotope rate effect below the transition temperature indicates that a step in the reaction sequence other than hydrogen abstraction becomes rate-limiting when the lipid is in the crystalline state. In this system translational diffusion does not emerge as the rate-limiting step. The liposomes contained sufficient reductase and cytochrome b5 so that translational diffusion was not rate-limiting."

The half-maximally active dose of epinephrine was 10-7 M and of phenylephrine was 10(-6) M. These effects were blocked by alpha-adrenergic antagonists including phenoxybenzamine, but were largely unaffected by beta-adrenergic antagonists including propranolol. Epinephrine caused a transient 2-fold elevation of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) which was abolished by propranolol and other beta blockers, but was unaffected by phenoxybenzamine and other alpha blockers. Phenoxybenzamine and propranolol were shown to be specific for their respective adrenergic receptors and to not affect the actions of glucagon or exogenous cAMP. Neither epinephrine (10-7 M), phenylephrine (10-5 M), nor glucagon (10-7 M) inactivated glycogen synthase in liver cells from fed rats. When the glycogen synthase activity ratio (-glucose 6-phosphate/+ glucose 6-phosphate) was increased from 0.09 to 0.66 by preincubation of such cells with 40 mM glucose, these agents substantially inactivated the enzyme. Incubation of hepatocytes from fed rats resulted in glycogen depletion which was correlated with an increase in the glycogen synthase activity ratio and a decrease in phosphorylase alpha activity. In hepatocytes from fasted animals, the glycogen synthase activity ratio was 0.32 +/- 0.03, and epinephrine, glucagon, and phenylephrine were able to lower this significantly. The effects of epinephrine and phenylephrine on the enzyme were blocked by phenoxybenzamine, but were largely unaffected by propranolol. Maximal phosphorylase activation in hepatocytes from fasted rats incubated with 10(-5) M phenylephrine preceded the maximal inactivation of glycogen synthase. Addition of glucose rapidly reduced, in a dose-dependent manner, both basal and phenylephrine-elevated phosphorylase alpha activity in hepatocytes prepared from fasted rats. Glucose also increased the glycogen synthase activity ratio, but this effect lagged behind the change in phosphorylase. Phenylephrine (10-5 M) and glucagon (5 x 10(-10) M) decreased by one-half the fall in phosphoryalse alpha activity seen with 10 mM glucose and markedly suppressed the elevation of glycogen synthase activity. The following conclusions are drawn from these findings. (a) The effects of epinephrine and phenylephrine on carbohydrate metabolism in rat liver parenchymal cells are mediated predominantly by alpha-adrenergic receptors. (b) Stimulation of these receptors by epinephrine or phenylephrine results in activation of phosphorylase and gluconeogenesis and inactivation of glycogen synthase by mechanisms not involving an increase in cellular cAMP. (c) Activation of beta-adrenergic receptors by epinephrine leads to the accumulation of cAMP, but this is associated with minimal activation of phosphorylase or inactivation of glycogen synthase..."
https://openalex.org/W1513969749,"Adenosine deaminase exists in multiple molecular forms in human tissue. One form of the enzyme appears to be particulate. Three forms of the enzyme are soluble and interconvertible with apparent molecular weights of approximately 36,000, 114,000, and 298,000 (designated small, intermediate, and large, respectively). The small form of adenosine deaminase is convertible to the large form only in the presence of a protein, which has an apparent molecular weight of 200,000 and has no adenosine deaminase activity. This conversion of the small form of the enzyme to the large form occurs at 4 degrees, exhibits a pH optimum of 5.0 to 8.0, and is associated with a loss of conversion activity. The small form of the enzyme predominates in tissue preparations exhibiting the higher enzyme-specific activities and no detectable conversion activity. The large form of adenosine deaminase predominates in tissue extracts exhibiting the lower enzyme specific activities and abundant conversion activity. The small form of adenosine deaminase shows several electrophoretic variants by isoelectric focusing. The electrophoretic heterogeneity observed with the large form of the enzyme is similar to that observed with the small form, with the exception that several additional electrophoretic variants are uniformly identified. No organ specificity is demonstrable for the different electrophoretic forms. The kinetic characteristics of the three soluble molecular species of adenosine deaminase are identical except for pH optimum, which is 5.5 for the intermediate species and 7.0 to 7.4 for the large and small forms."

https://openalex.org/W1500961850,"The effects of the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine on the levels of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and the activity of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase in isolated rat liver parenchymal cells were studied. Cyclic AMP was very slightly (5 to 13%) increased in cells incubated with phenylephrine at a concentration (10(-5) M) which was maximally effective on glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. However, the increase was significant only at 5 min. Cyclic AMP levels with 10(-5) M phenylephrine measured at this time were reduced by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, but were unaffected by the alpha-blocker phenoxybenzamine, indicating that the elevation was due to weak beta activity of the agonist. When doses of glucagon, epinephrine, and phenylephrine which produced the same stimulation of glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis were added to the same batches of cells, there were marked rises in cAMP with glucagon, minimal increases with epinephrine, and little or no changes with phenylephrine, indicating that the two catecholamine stimulated these processes largely by mechanisms not involving cAMP accumulation. DEAE-cellulose chromatography of homogenates of liver cells revealed two major peaks of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. These eluted at similar salt concentrations as the type I and II isozymes from rat heart. Optimal conditions for preservation of hormone effects on the activity of the enzyme in the cells were determined. High concentrations of phenylephrine (10(-5) M and 10(-4) M) produced a small increase (10 tp 16%) in the activity ratio (-cAMP/+cAMP) of the enzyme. This was abolished by propranolol, but not by phenoxybenzamine, indicating that it was due to weak beta activity of the agonist. The increase in the activity ratio of the kinase with 10(-5) M phenylephrine was much smaller than that produced by a glycogenolytically equivalent dose of glucagon. The changes in protein kinase induced by phenylephrine and the blockers and by glucagon were thus consistent with those in cAMP. Theophylline and 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, which inhibit cAMP phosphodiesterase, potentiated the effects of phenylephrine on glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. The potentiations were blocked by phenoxybenzamine, but not by propranolol. Methylisobutylxanthine increased the levels of cAMP and enhanced the activation of protein kinase in cells incubated with phenylephrine. These effects were diminished or abolished by propanolol, but were unaffected by phenoxybenzamine. It is concluded from these data that alpha-adrenergic activation of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in isolated rat liver parenchymal cells occurs by mechanisms not involving an increase in total cellular cAMP or activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The results also show that phosphodiesterase inhibitors potentiate alpha-adrenergic actions in hepatocytes mainly by a mechanism(s) not involving a rise in cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1578684139,"An isotope scrambling method is described for the detection of transient [Enz:ADP:P-X] formation from [18O]ATP in ATP-coupled enzyme reactions. The method makes use of torsional symmetry of the newly formed (see article) group in ADP. [18 O]ATP labeled in the betagama bridge oxygen was incubated with enzyme and reversible cleavage of the PbetaO -- Pgamma bond was detected by the appearance of 18O in the beta nonbridge oxygens of the ATP pool. Experiments with sheep brain and Escherichia coli glutamine synthetases show that cleavage of ATP of enzyme-bound ADP and P-X requires glutamate. The exchange catalyzed by the E. coli enzyme with glutamate occurs in the absence of ammonia and is partially inhibited by added NH4Cl, as expected if the exchange is in the mechanistic pathway for glutamine synthesis. The results provide kinetic support for a two-step mechanism where phosphoryl transfer from ATP to glutamate precedes reaction with ammonia."

https://openalex.org/W1513277720,"The tyrosine-sensitive 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (7-phospho-2-keto-3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptonate D-erythrose-4-phosphate lyase (pyruvate-phosphorylating), EC 4.2.1.15) was purified to homogeneity from extracts of Escherichia coli K12. A spectrophotometric assay of the enzyme activity, based on the absorption difference of substrates and products at 232 nm, was developed. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 66,000 as judged by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200, and a subunit molecular weight of 39,000 as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. This suggests either a rapid monomer-dimer equilibrium, or a very asymmetric shape for the native enzyme. The enzyme shows a narrow pH optimum around pH 7.0. The enzyme is stable for several months when stored at -20 degrees in phosphate buffer containing phosphoenol-pyruvate. Intersecting lines in double reciprocal plots of initial velocity data at substrate concentrations in the micromolar range suggest a sequential mechanism with-catalyzed reaction. Product inhibition studies specify an ordered sequential BiBi mechanism with a dead-end E-P complex. The feedback inhibitor tyrosine at concentrations above 10 muM exhibits noncompetitive inhibition with respect to erythrose-4-P, and competitive inhibition with respect to the other substrate, P-enolpyruvate. In addition, tyrosine at concentrations of at least 10 muM causes an alteration of one or more than one kinetic parameter of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1511190700,"Evidence is presented that the changes in absorption spectrum obtained on complex formation between Old Yellow Enzyme and phenolic compounds are due to charge-transfer interactions. The positive correlation between the energy of the long wavelength transition and the Hammett para constant with a series of para-substituted phenols indicates that the phenol is the charge-transfer donor and the oxidized flavin of the enzyme is the charge-transfer acceptor. The same conclusion is drawn from studies in which the flavin of the native enzyme, flavin mononucleotide, was replaced by a variety of artificial flavins of different oxidation-reduction potential. The effect of pH on the dissociation constant for the enzyme-ligand binding also indicates that it is the phenolate anion, rather than the conjugate acid, which is responsible for the charge-transfer interaction. The significance of these results is discussed relative to long wavelength absorbing species detected with other flavoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1484478520,"The number of protons ejected per pair of electrons passing each energy-conserving site in the electron transport chain (the H+/site ratio) has been investigated in rat liver mitochondria by means of the oxygen pulse technique introduced by Mitchell and Moyle (1967) (Biochem. J. 105, 1147-1162). The usual H+/site values of 2.0 observed by this method were found to be substantially underestimated as a result of the influx of phosphate into the mitochondria. This was shown by three different kinds of experiments. 1. Addition of N-ethylmaleimide or mersalyl, inhibitors of mitochondrial phosphate transport, increased the H+/site ratio from 2.0 to 3.0. The dependence of this effect on the concentration of either inhibitor was identical with that for inhibition of phosphate transport. Added phosphate diminished the H+/site ratio to values below 2.0 in the absence of N-ethylmaleimide. N-Ethylmaleimide protected the elevated H+/site ratio of 3.0 against the deleterious effect of added phosphate, but did not prevent a lowering effect of weak acid anions such as 3-hydroxybutyrate. 2. Prior washing of mitochondria to remove the endogenous phosphate that leaks out during the anaerobic preincubation led to H+/site ratios near 3.0, which were not increased by N-ethylmaleimide. Addition of low concentrations of phosphate to such phosphate-depleted mitochondria decreased the H+/site ratio to 2.0; addition of N-ethylmaleimide returned the ratio to 3.0. 3. Lowering the temperature to 5 degrees, which slows down phosphate transport, led to H+/site values of 3.0 even in the absence of N-ethylmaleimide. The H+/site ratio of 3.0 observed in the absence of phosphate movements was not dependent on any narrowly limited set of experimental conditions. It occurred with either Ca2+ or K+ (in the presence of valinomycin) as mobile permeant cation. It was independent of the concentration of succinate, oxygen, mitochondria, or rotenone, additions of Ca2+, Li+, or Na+ and was independent of medium pH between 6.5 and 7.5. Inhibitors of the transport of ions or acids other than phosphate did not affect the H+/site ratio. These results indicate that re-uptake of endogenous phosphate, lost from mitochondria during anaerobic preincubation, reduces the observed H+ ejection and leads to underestimated H+/site ratios of 2.0 in the oxygen pulse method. When phosphate movements are eliminated by the procedures described above, the observed H+/site ratio is about 3.0. This value appears to be closer to the true H+/site ratio for the primary H+ ejection process during electron transport."

https://openalex.org/W1548654166,"The membranous guanylate cyclase of Balb 3T3 fibroblasts was stimulated by a fraction of calf serum extracted by ether. Stimulation was observed with Mg2+ as the only bivalent cation in the presence of Lubrol PX. The activator co-chromatographed with free fatty acids, and several of these were found to stimulate guanylate cyclase. Among the saturated fatty acids, myristic acid had the highest activity. Stimulating activity diminished as the hydrocarbon chain of the fatty acid was lengthened or shortened. Introduction of an unsaturated bond enhanced the activation by the longer fatty acids. This pattern of specificity is similar to that observed for the effect of fatty acids on many other membranous functions. Under appropriate conditions fatty acids were found to stimulate guanylate cyclase activity in the absence of Lubrol PX. The relationship among the effects of Mg2+, Mn2+, Lubrol PX, and fatty acids on enzyme activity was examined. On the basis of these studies, it appears that fatty acids stimulate the enzyme by a mechanism different from nonionic detergents or Mn2+."

https://openalex.org/W1503129858,"The acyl-CoA:sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.15) (glycerol-P acyltransferase) and acyl-CoA:dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.42) (DHAP acyltransferase) activities were investigated in vitro in order to evaluate the quantitative contribution of the glycerol-P and DHAP pathways for the synthesis of triacylglycerols in isolated fat cells and to test the hypothesis that these two activities may be dual catalytic functions of a single enzyme. More than 85% of both acyltransferase activities was associated with the microsomal subcellular fraction. The microsomal glycerol-P acyltransferase activity showed an apparent Km of 8 muM for glycerol-P with a Vmax of 15.6 nmol/min/mg, while the DHAP acyltransferase activity showed an apparent Km of 40 muM for DHAP with a Vmax of 9.7 nmol/min/mg. Glycerol-P was a competitive inhibitor (Ki = 7.2 muM) of the DHAP acyltransferase, and DHAP was a competitive inhibitor (Ki = 92 muM) of the glycerol-P acyltransferase. The two acyltransferase activities showed virtual identity in their pH dependence, acyl-CoA chain length dependence, thermolability, and inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide. Trypsin, detergents, collagenase, phospholipases, and various salts and organic solvents also had similar effects on both activities. Taken as a whole, the data strongly suggest that the microsomal glycerol-P and DHAP acyltransferase activities actually represent dual functions of a single enzyme. Calculations based on the above kinetic constants and previously reported glycerol-P and DHAP pools in adipocytes suggest that the in vivo ratio of glycerol-P to DHAP acylation should be greater than 24:1."
https://openalex.org/W1498435248,"In this paper, the synthesis of collagen cross-links in vitro was investigated in a defined system consisting of highly purified chick cartilage lysyl oxidase and chick bone collagen fibrils. Cross-link synthesis in vitro was quite similar to the biosynthesis of collagen cross-links in vivo. Enzyme-dependent synthesis of cross-link intermediates and cross-linked collagen derived from lathyritic collagen occurred. The concentration of the two principal reducible cross-links, N6:6'-dehydro-5,5'-dihydroxylysinonorleucine and N6:6'-dehydro-5-hydroxylysinonorleucine, increased to a peak value of approximately two cross-links per molecule and then decreased. Synthesis of histidinohydroxymerodesmosine and a second polyfunctional cross-link of unknown structure began after synthesis of bifunctional cross-links was largely completed and proceeded linearly afterwards. Inhibition of lysyl oxidase after the bulk of bifunctional cross-link synthesis had occurred did not alter the rate of decrease in reducible cross-link concentration but did inhibit further histidinohydroxymerodesmosine synthesis. These results indicate that lysyl oxidase and collagen fibrils are the only macromolecules required for cross-link biosynthesis in vivo. It is likely that the decrease in reducible cross-links observed during fibril maturation results from spontaneous reactions within the collagen fibril rather than additional enzymatic reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1528967283,"The kinetics of inactivation and reactivation of rabbit skeletal muscle phosphofructokinase have been studied as a function of pH and enzyme concentration at constant temperature in phosphate buffer. From the enzyme concentration dependence, we conclude that the minimal mechanism for inactivation involves a protonation step followed by isomerization to an inactive form and then dissociation to a species of one-half the molecular weight. Other data indicate a subsequent isomerization of the dissociated form. The pH and temperature dependence of the inactivation process shows that it is controlled by ionizable groups, and that the apparent pK for these groups is temperature-dependent in such a way as to make the enzyme show the characteristic of cold lability below pH 7. Reactivation of the inactive enzyme occurs by a kinetically different pathway involving deprotonation of an inactive, dissociated form to a form which may either isomerize to another inactive form, or dimerize to the active enzyme. A general mechanism is postulated in which the inactivation and reactivation processes are different aspects of the same mechanism. This mechanism assumes four species (two containing four subunits and two containing two subunits) each of which can exist in a protonated and unprotonated form. Inactivation or reactivation induced by changes in pH or temperature reflect the kinetic establishment of a new steady state between these forms. How the apparent pK values which control the distribution of the enzyme between protonated and unprotonated forms describe the pH-dependent characteristics of the enzyme is discussed in terms of the proposed mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1572440873,"Lysyl oxidase is a specific amine oxidase that catalyzes the formation of aldehyde cross-link intermediates in collagen and elastin. In this study, lysyl oxidase from embryonic chick cartilage was purified to constant specific activity and a single protein band on sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gel electrophoresis. This band had an apparent molecular weight of 62,000. The eluted protein cross-reacted with inhibiting antisera developed against highly purified lysyl oxidase. The highly purified enzyme was active with both insoluble elastin and embryonic chick skin or bone collagen precipitated as reconstituted, native fibrils. There was low activity with nonhydroxylated collagen, collagen monomers, or native fibrils isolated from lathyritic calvaria. The maximum number of aldehyde intermediates formed per molecule of collagen that became insoluble was two. These results indicate that lysyl oxidase has maximum activity on ordered aggregates of collagen molecules that may be overlapping associations of only a few collagen molecules across. Formation of aldehyde intermediates and cross-links during fibril formation may facilitate the biosynthesis of stable collagen fibrils and contribute to increased fibril tensile strength in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1487406657,"Various properties of the steroid 5alpha-reductase have been examined in cell-free extracts of skin and of fibroblasts cultured from genital and nongenital skin from control subjects and from patients with several forms of male pseudohermaphroditism. When 20alpha-hydroxy-4-[1,2-3H] pregnen-3-one was used as substrate, two 5alpha-reductase activities could be demonstrated in intact skin and cultured fibroblasts. The major activity, previously described for microsomes from human prepuce and extracts of cultured foreskin fibroblasts, is characterized by a narrow pH optimum near 5.5 and is limited to fibroblasts derived from genital skin. A second activity, not limited by the site of biopsy, has been demonstrated over a higher and broader range of pH (from 7 to 9); this enzyme activity is found in both genital and nongenital skin and in fibroblasts cultured from all skin regions. Whereas there is wide variability in the activity at pH 5.5 in genital skin fibroblasts, the activity at pH 7 to 9 is similar in fibroblasts derived from all anatomical sites. The two activities exhibit different kinetics with respect to steroid substrate and are also dissimilar in their subcellular distributions. Other properties, such as coenzyme requirement, steroid substrate specificity, and instability with increasing temperature, appear to be similar."
https://openalex.org/W1558621676,"The pH dependence of the apparent tetramer to dimer dissociation constant has been determined at 20 degrees for both oxy- and deoxyhemoglobins A and Kansas. These measurements were made by three different procedures: gel chromatography, sedimentation velocity, and kinetic methods in either of three buffer systems: 0.05 M cacodylate, Tris, or glycine with 1 mM EDTA and 0.1 M NaCl between pH 6.5 and 11. The tetramer-dimer dissociation constant of human oxyhemoglobin A decreases from about 3.2 X 10(-6) M at pH 6.0 to about 3.2 X 10(-8) M at pH 8.5. The slope of this line indicates that the dissociation of tetramer to dimer is accompanied by the uptake of about 0.6 protons per mol of tetramer in this region. The corresponding dissociation constant for deoxyhemoglobin in the same pH region increases apparently almost linearly from 1.0 x 10(-12) M at pH 6.5 to about 1.0 x 10(-5) M at pH 11. To dimer is associated with the release of about 1.6 protons per mol of tetramer. Comparison of these data with the known proton release accompanying the oxygenation of tetramers confirms that the pH dependence of oxygen binding by dimers must be very small. The present data predict that the overall proton release or uptake per oxygen bound by dimer should be less than 0.1. The tetramer-dimer dissociation equilibria of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobins above pH 8.5 have identical pH dependences. In this range the dissociation constant of deoxy-Hb is about one-tenth that of oxyhemoglobin. Human oxyhemoglobin Kansas is known to have an enhanced tetramer-dimer dissociation compared with that of hemoglobin A. Below pH 8.5 the tetramer-dimer dissociation constant of Hb Kansas is about 400 times greater than that of HbA in the absence of phosphate buffers. In contrast, the tetramer-dimer dissociation constants of deoxyhemoglobins A and Kansas appear to be identical. These findings are consistent with previous structural observations on these hemoglobins. The data on the tetramer-dimer dissociation of human hemoglobin were used to calculate the total free energy of binding of oxygen to the tetramer and the median oxygen pressure on the basis of fundamental linkage relations and a pH-independent estimate of the total free energy of binding oxygen to dimer. Simulated oxygen binding curves were generated with the equations of Ackers and Halvorson (Ackers, G. K., and Halvorson, H. (1974) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 71, 4312-4316) by making two assumptions: (a) that the dimers are noncooperative and pH-independent in O2 binding and (b) that the distribution of cooperative energy in the oxygenation of tetramers is independent of pH. We have compared these simulations with experimental data obtained at low protein concentrations (30 to 124 muM heme) to show that the variation in oxygen affinity with pH can be described in terms of the subunit equilibria. We conclude that an accurate analysis of the contributions of individual oxygen binding steps to the Bohr effect cannot be made without considering the contributions of the dimers to oxygen binding..."
https://openalex.org/W1607593862,Aminooxyacetate and alpha-amino-gamma-aminooxybutyrate (canaline) react specifically with the P-pyridoxal groups of cystathionase to produce characteristic changes in the absorption and fluorescence properties of the bound cofactor. The increase in fluorescence at 450 nm was used to monitor the reaction. Aminooxyacetate attacks the Schiff base linkage of the enzyme several times faster (k1 = 3700 M-1 min-1 and k2 = 1000 M-1 min-1) than it attacks the aldehydic carbon of free P-pyridoxal (k = 290 M-1 min-1). Similar results were obtained with canaline. The kinetic studies indicate that a Schiff base linkage in the enzyme cystathionase should offer direct kinetic advantage during the reaction between the substrate and the cofactor. It is also shown that the inhibitor L-alpha-gamma-aminobutyrate reacts with bound P-pyridoxal to form free P-pyridoxamine. The rate of formation of P-pyridoxamine parallels the rate of enzyme inactivation.
https://openalex.org/W148148208,"It is shown that the degree of regulatory kinetic behavior of rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase increases at a given pH and lower temperatures, as well as at a given temperature and lower pH values. It is also shown that the regulatory kinetic behavior which appears at lower pH values is inherent in the tetrameric (active) form of the enzyme. We conclude that a portion of the mechanism proposed previously (Bock, P.E., and Frieden, C. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 5630-5636) to describe the pH and temperature-dependent inactivation or reactivation may also be used to explain the pH and temperature-dependent regulatory kinetic behavior. According to this proposal, two rapidly equilibrating forms of the enzyme, which differ in the degree of protonation of specific residues, differ in their ability to bind substrates. While the protonated form of the enzyme subsequently becomes inactive by isomerization and dissociation, this process is too slow to affect the kinetic results, making direct comparisons between the association-dissociation behavior and regulatory kinetic behavior invalid. The time dependence of the processes of inactivation or reactivation in the presence or absence of ligands and of the appearance of regulatory kinetic behavior is discussed in relation to their possible role in metabolic regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1523849187,"The effect of ligands, including substrates and allosteric effectors, on the pH-dependent inactivation and reactivation of rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase has been examined in terms of the mechanism proposed previously (Bock, P.E. and Fireden, C. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 5630-5636). It is concluded thatt many ligands exert their effect by binding preferentially to either protonated or unprotonated forms of the enzyme and thus shifting an apparent pK for the inactivation or reactivation process. ATP and fructose 6-phosphate influence the apparent pK to different extents and in different directions, with ATP binding preferentially to the protonated forms and fructose 6-phosphate to the unprotonated forms. Enzyme inactivated by ATP can be reactivated by the addition of fructose 6-phosphate. The experiments indicate that inactivation and reactivation in the presence of these ligands can occur by kinetically different pathways as has been found for these processes in the absence of ligands. The results are discussed in relation to what might be expected for ligand binding properties of the enzyme as a function of pH, temperature, and enzyme concentration. The effect of ATP and MgATP is complex, perhaps representing more than one site of binding. Citrate appears to bind preferentially to protonated forms of the enzyme while fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and AMP bind preferentially to the unprotonated forms. ADP, K+, and NH4+ appear to have little or no preference in binding to different enzyme forms."

Calcium, with or without magnesium adenosine triphosphate, dose not alter this hindrance in synthetic filaments. This implies that calcium does not directly move the crossbridges toward thin filaments on activation of muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1651612468,"Over a wide range of pH horseradish peroxidase compound I can be reduced quantitatively via compound II to the native enzyme by only 1 molar equivalent of p-cresol. Since 2 molar equivalents of electrons are required for the single turnover of the enzymatic cycle, p-cresol behaves as a 2-electron reductant. With p-cresol and compound I in a 1:1 ratio compound II and p-methylphenoxy radicals are obtained in the transient state. Compound II is then reduced to the native enzyme. A possible explanation for the facile reduction of compound II involves reaction with the dimerization product of these radicals, 1/2 molar equivalent of 2,2'-dihydroxy-5,5'-dimethylbiphenyl. If only 1/2 molar equivalent of p-cresol is present, than at high pH the reduction stops at compound II. The major steady state peroxidase oxidation product of p-cresol (with p-cresol in large excess compared to the enzyme concentration) is Pummerer's ketone. Pummerer's ketone is only reactive at pH values greater than about 9 where significant amounts of the enol can be formed via the enolate anion. Therefore, in alkaline solution it is reactive with compound I, but not with compound II, which is converted into an unreactive basic form. These results indicate that Pummerer's ketone cannot be the intermediate free radical product responsible for reducing compound II in the single turnover experiments. It is postulated that Pummerer's ketone is formed only in the steady state by the reaction of the p-methylphenoxy radical with excess p-cresol."
https://openalex.org/W1534273623,"Rate constants for the reaction between horseradish peroxidase compound I and p-cresol have been determined at several values of pH between 2.98 and 10.81. These rate constants were used to construct a log (rate) versus pH profile from which it is readily seen that the most reactive form of the enzyme is its most basic form within this pH range so that base catalysis is occurring. At the maximum rate a second order rate constant of (5.1 +/- 0.3) x 10(-7) M-1 s-1 at 25 degrees is obtained. The activation energy of the reaction at the maximum rate was determined from an Arrhenius plot to be 5.0 +/- 0.5 kcal/mol. Evidence for an exception to the generally accepted enzymatic cycle of horseradish peroxidase is presented. One-half molar equivalent of p-cresol can convert compound I quantitatively to compound II at high pH, whereas usually this step requires 1 molar equivalent of reductant.

https://openalex.org/W1504832378,"Sulfite oxidase purified from livers of tungsten-treated rats has been used for EPR studies of tungsten substituted at the molybdenum site of the enzyme in a fraction of the molecules. The EPR signal of W(V) in sulfite oxidase is quite similar to that of Mo(V) in its line shape and in its sensitivity to the presence of anions such as phosphate and fluoride. Hyperfine interaction with a dissociable proton is also observed in both signals. The pH-dependent alteration in line shape exhibited by the Mo(V) EPR signal of the rat liver enzyme. Incomplete reduction of the tungsten center at pH 9 is indicated by attenuated signal intensity at this pH. The W(V) signal has g values lower than those of the Mo(V) signal, has a much broader resonance envelope, and is much less readily saturated by increasing microwave power. Kinetic studies on the reduction of the heme and tungsten centers of sulfite oxidase have shown that reduction of de-molybdo forms of sulfite oxidase by sulfite is catalyzed by the residual traces of native molybdenum-containing molecules. Reduction is accomplished by electron transfer involving intermolecular heme-heme interaction. The W(V) signal is generated only after all the heme centers are reduced. The rate and extent of heme reduction at pH 9 are the same as at pH 7. Studies on the reoxidation of W(V) and reduced heme by O2 and by cytochrome c suggest that the cytochrome b5 of sulfite oxidase is the site of electron transfer to cytochrome c, whereas oxidase activity is the property of the molybdenum center. It appears that the tungsten center in sulfite oxidase is incapable of oxidizing sulfite."
https://openalex.org/W1607420243,"The abnormal accumulation of lipids due to myo-inositol deficiency in Saccharomyces carlsbergensis, and the mechanism involved was investigated. The deficient cells contained much more neutral lipids with a greater ratio of unsaturated fatty acids compared to the supplemented cells, whereas there was no significant change in their phospholipid contents. The biosynthesis of fatty acids and sterols from acetate, and of triacylglycerols and sterol esters from palmitate was markedly augmented in the deficient cells. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity of the deficient supernatant was 2- to 5-fold higher than that of the supplemented. However, the activity from both sources was not significantly different after Sephadex G-25 gel filtration of the supernatant, suggesting the presence of low molecular effector(s) in the deficient supernatant. There was a great increase in acid-soluble glycogen, trehalose, and fructose-1,6-P2, as well as a drastic decrease in citrate in the deficient cells. Their intracellular levels were calculated so that their effects on acetyl-CoA carboxylase was examined over the range of physiological concentration. Citrate strongly inhibited the enzyme activity of the supernatant, but it had no effect on the preparation after gel filtration. On the other hand, fructose-1,6-P2 stimulated the enzyme activity both before and after gel filtration. The acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity in the gel filtrate was measured as a function of citrate concentration at several fixed concentrations of fructose-1,6-P2. Citrate counteracted the activation by fructose-1,6-P2 in a dose-dependent manner. Citrate lacked the inhibitory effect in the absence of fructose-1,6-P2. It was concluded from these results that neutral lipid accumulation in the deficient cells reflected an increase in the synthesis of fatty acids, at least partly based on an enhancement of acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity, and that the operation of a reciprocal regulation of the enzyme by fructose-1,6-P2 and citrate caused a marked elevation of the enzyme activity in the deficient cells with a high fructose-1,6-P2 level and a low citrate level."
https://openalex.org/W1578069346,"Calcium binding to adipocyte plasma membranes has been assessed by equilibrium dialysis and by membrane filtration techniques. Calcium binding was specific and saturable, displaying two distinct classes of binding sites. The affinity constants and maximum binding capacities in the presence of 0.1 M KCl were 4.5 X 10(4) M-1 and 1.8 nmol/mg of protein and 2.0 X 10(3) M-1 and 13.7 nmol/mg for the high and low affinity sites, respectively. Bound calcium was totally dissociated in the presence of excess calcium within 11.0 min in two distinct phases corresponding to the two classes of sites. Association and dissociation rate constants for the high affinity sites were 7.7 X 10(2) M-1S-1 and 9.2 X 10(-3S-1 respectively. Free energy changes at 24 degrees were +6.4 kcal mol-1 for the high affinity sites and +4.5 kcal mol-1 for the low affinity sites. The high affinity sites demonstrated a pH optimum of 7.0 whereas the binding to the low affinity sites progressively increased between pH 6.0 and 9.0. Low concentrations of MgCl2 (less than 300 muM) enhanced calcium binding slightly, whereas high concentrations of KCl and MgCl2 were noncompetitive inhibitors of calcium binding. Procaine and ruthenium red had no effect on calcium binding and lanthanum was a poor inhibitor of calcium binding. This represents the first report of calcium binding to adipocyte plasma membranes and the first kinetic analysis of calcium binding to biological membranes. The specificity of this calcium-binding system in adipocyte plasma membranes suggests its importance in cellular bioregulation."

The formation of acidic galactose lipid and mannose lipid was greatly reduced in vitamin A deficiency, primarily in tissues known to be mucus-producing. Mouse mastocytoma tissue was active in forming acidic galactose lipids with UDP-galactose as substrate. One of the products was identified as retinylphosphate galactose. The synthetase reaction producing this compound exhibited an apparent pH optimum at 6.3. The presence of detergent and retinol stimulated the synthetase reaction, which exhibited an absolute requirement for Mn2+ or Mg2+. The synthetase reaction was readily reversible. Incubation of particulate enzyme with retinylphosphate galactose and UDP yielded UDP-galactose and a compound tentatively identified as retinylphosphate. The galactose lipid was isolated by column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and silica gel. The retinylphosphate galactose was homogeneous when examined by thin layer chromatography. Mild acid hydrolysis of labeled retinylphosphate galactose yields [14C]galactose, whereas alkaline hydrolysis and hydrogenolysis produced [14C]galactose 1-phosphate. Retinylphosphate galactose bound to vitamin A-depleted, retinol-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1598075047,"Nuclear magnetic resonance has been used to study the binding of [13C]carbamyl-P (90% enriched) to the catalytic subunit of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamylase. Upon forming a binary complex, there is a small change in the chemical shift of the carbonyl carbon resonance, 2 Hz upfield at pH 7.0, indicating that the environments of the carbonyl group in the active site and in water are similar. When succinate, an analog of L-aspartate, is added to form a ternary complex, there is a large downfield change in the chemical shift for carbamyl-P, consistent with interaction between the carbonyl group and a proton donor of the enzyme. The change might also be caused by a ring current froma nearby aromatic amino acid residue. From the pH dependence of this downfield change and from the effects of L-aspartate analogs other than succinate, the form of the enzyme involved is proposed to be an isomerized ternary complex, previously observed in temperature jump and proton NMR studies. The downfield change to chemical shift for carbamyl-P bound to the isomerized complex is 17.7 +/- 1.0 Hz. Using this value, the relative ability of other four-carbon dicarboxylic acids to form isomerized ternary complexes with the enzyme and carbamyl-P has been evaluated quantitatively. The 13C peak for the transition state analog N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA), 90% enriched specifically at the amide carbonyl group, is shifted 20 Hz downfield of the peak for free PALA upon binding to the catalytic subunit at pH 7.0. In contrast, the peak for [1-13C] phosphonaceatmide shifts upfield by about 6 Hz upon binding. Since PALA induces isomerization of the enzyme and phosphonacetamide does not, these data provide further evidence consistent with protonation of the carbonyl group only upon isomerization. The degrees of protonation is strong acids of the carbonyl groups of PALA, phosphonacetamide and urethan (a model for the labile carbamyl-P) have been determined, as have the chemical shifts for these compounds upon full protonation. From these data it is calculated that the amide carbonyl groups of carbamyl-P and PALA might be protonated to a maximum of about 20% in the isomerized complexes at pH 7.0. The change in conformation of the enzyme-carbamyl-P complex upon binding L-aspartate, previously proposed to aid catalysis by compressing the two substrates together in the active site, may be accompanied by polarization of the C=O bond, making this ordinarily unreactive group a much better electrophile. A keto analog of PALA, 4,5-dicarboxy-2-ketopentyl phosphonate, also binds tightly to the catalytic subunit and induces a very similar conformational change, whereas an alcohol analog, 4,5-dicarboxy-2-hydroxypentyl phosphonate, does not bind tightly, indicating the critical importance of an unhindered carbonyl group with trigonal geometry."
https://openalex.org/W39015103,"Membrane vesicles from Azotobacter vinelandii O prepared by osmotic lysis of spheroplasts in tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane/acetate buffer (pH 7.8) contain a latent adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase). The ATPase can be activated when the vesicles are incubated in the presence of an electron donor (D-lactate) and a mixture of adenosine diphosphate and inorganic phosphate or by controlled treatment with trypsin. After the ATPase is activated, the membrane vesicles in the presence of adenosine triphosphate accumulate calcium but not glucose or rubidium (in the presence of valinomycin). ATP-dependent calcium uptake follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km of 48 muM and a Vmax of 20 nmol/min/mg of membrane protein and is highly specific for calcium over cations magnesium, barium, lanthanum, sodium, potassium, and lithium. The calcium accumulated in the presence of ATP is freely exchangeable with external calcium and is rapidly released in the presenceof uncouplers or ATPase inhibitors. Calcium uptake in the presenceof ATP is blocked by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, ADP, p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate, by the proton-conducting ionophores m-chlorophenylcarbonylcyanide hydrazone, nigericin, monensin, and gramicidin D, but not by potassium cyanide, anoxia, or valinomycin (in the presence of potassium). Measurements of the external pH of vesicle suspensions reveal that protons are actively taken up by the membranes during hydrolysis of ATP. These results suggest that vesicles prepared under these conditions have a topology which is inverted with respect to the intact cell and that calcium is accumulated by means of proton antiport."
https://openalex.org/W1514902512,"The purified respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli oxidizes NADH with either dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP). ferricyanide, or menadione as electron acceptors, with values for NADH are similar with the three electron acceptors (approximately 50 muM). The purified enzyme contains no flavin and has an absolute requirement for FAD, with Km values around 4 muM. The pH optimum of the enzyme appears to be between 6.5 and 7; the optimum is difficult to establish because of nonenzymatic reduction of DCIP at the lower pH values. Potassium cyanide stimulates the DCIP reductase activity about 2-fold, but has no effect on ferricyanide reductase. The enzyme exhibits hyperbolic kinetics with respect to NADH concentration in both the ferricyanide and DCIP reductase assays, but cooperatively is seen in the menadione reductase reaction. NAD+ is an effective competitive inhibitor of the reaction (Ki congruent to 20 muM); in the presence of NAD+, the NADH saturation curve becomes cooperative, even in the DCIP reductase assay. Many adenine containing nucleotides are competitive inhibitors of the enzyme. The apparent Ki values for these nucleotides as inhibitors of the purified enzyme, the membrane-bound NADH dehydrogenase, and the NADH oxidase are equivalent. An examination of inhibitory effects of a series of adenine nucleotides suggests that the inhibitors act as analogues of NAD+, which is the true physiological inhibitor. The results suggest that the enzyme in situ is always partially inhibited by the levels of NAD- in the E coli cell, and thus behaves in a cooperative fashion to changes in the NAD+/NADH ratio. An antibody has been elicited against the purified NADH dehydrogenase. Immunodiffusion and crossed immunoelectrophoresis show that the antibody is directed principally against the NADH dehydrogenase, with some activity against minor contaminants in the purified preparation. The antibody inhibits NADH dehydrogenase activity 50% at saturating levels. When this antibody preparation is used to examine solubilized membrane preparations, two major immunoprecipitates are found. A parallel inhibition of the membrane-bound NADH dehydrogenase and NADH oxidase activities is seen, supporting the hypothesis that the purified enzyme is indeed a component of the respiratory chain-dependent NADH oxidase pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1515340785,"A ribonuclease, purified 2500-fold from human liver, was found to be inactive against synthetic homopolynucleotides, whereas synthetic co-polymers containing adenylic acid were rapidly degraded. The specificity of the RNase is unique in that only purine residues, in a 5:4 ratio of guanylic to adenylic acid, are found at the 5' termini of the degradation products of yeast RNA. No specificity was observed at the 3' termini of the fragments. When analyzed by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, approximately 80% of the oligonucletoides were 4 to 11 residues in length. The hydrolysis of RNA by the liver enzyme, when examined in low ionic strength buffer, could be increased severalfold over control levels by the addition of polyamines. The enzyme was found to exist as two distinct species on sucrose gradients, with molecular weights of 128,000 and 14,000. However, the addition of spermidine to the gradients resulted in the recovery of all the enzyme activity as the smaller species. The polyamines were also shown to reverse the inhibition of the enzyme by the ordered polynucleotides, polyguanylic acid and polyadenylic acid. Inhibition of enzyme activity by the polyadenylic acid segment of various mammalian mRNAs was also demonstrated."

After a 24-h digestion at 36 degrees with the lysosomal extract at a pH of 5.5 or lower (collagen/lysosomal protein; 2/1 or 8/1), both native and denatured collagen were degraded to an extent equivalent to 60 to 70% of that observed upon total acid hydrolysis in 6 N HCl as measured by the ninhydrin reaction (570 nm). At a pH of 6.0, native collagen and denatured collagen were degraded by the mixture of lysosomal proteinases to 11% and 40% of total acid hydrolysis, respectively. At pH 6.5 AND 7.0, the corresponding values were 3% versus 33% and 0.3% versus 11%, respectively. Fragments of collagen (TCA and TCB) are produced when mammalian collagenase degrades native collagen at 25 degrees. These fragments were degraded by the lysosomal extract at 36 degrees to an extent equivalent to 28% and 8% of total acid hydrolysis at pH 6.5 and 7.0, respectively. The experiments at pH 6.5 and 7.0 were done using a collagen/lysosomal protein ratio of 2/1. At pH 5.0 (a pH which is found within secondary lysosomes), the lysosomal extracts degraded collagen to a mixture of free amino acids and small peptides. Amino acid analysis established that approximately 30% of the amino acid residues of the collagen appeared in the lysosomal hydrolysate as free amino acids. Hydroxyproline and perhaps hydroxylysine were the only amino acids found in collagen which did not appear at least to some extent as the free amino acid in this hydrolysate."

Alkylation of methionine by benzyl bromide is more than 50 times faster than alkylation by iodoacetate. Fumarase is readily inactivated by exposure to benzyl bromide at pH 6.6 to 6.8 accompanied by alkylation of close to 1 methionine residue/subunit. Fumarase fully inactivated by exposure to benzyl bromide shows no detected alkylation of amino acid residues other than methionine. The rate of inactivation of fumarase by benzyl bromide is decreased about 4-fold by the presence of excess substrates. Denaturation of fumarase in 6 M urea at pH 6.5 exposes additional methionine as well as cysteine residues to alkylation."

https://openalex.org/W1578409468,"Thiamin dehydrogenase, a flavoprotein isolated from an unidentified soil bacterium, contains 1 mol of covalently bound FAD/mol of enzyme. A flavin peptide, isolated from tryptic-chymotryptic digests of the enzyme and hydrolyzed to the FMN level, shows a pH-dependent fluorescence yield being maximal at pH 3.5 to 4.0 and decreasing over 90% at pH 7.5 with a pKa of 5.8. Acid hydrolysis of the peptide results in an aminoacylflavin which shows a pKa of fluorescence quenching of 5.2. Absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectral data show the covalent substituent to be at the 8alpha position of the flavin as is the case with all known enzymes containing covalently bound flavin. The aminoacylflavin gives a negative Pauly reaction but yields 1 mol of histidine on drastic acid hydrolysis thus showing an imidazole ring nitrogen as the 8alpha substituent of the flavin. The aminoacylflavin differs from synthetic 8alpha-[N(3)-histidyl]riboflavin or its acid-modified form in pKa of fluorescence quenching, in electrophoretic mobility, in being reduced by borohydride, and in being labile to storage, yielding 8-formylriboflavin. In all of these properties, however, the 8alpha-histidylriboflavin isolated from thiamin dehydrogenase is indistinguishable from 8alpha-[N(1)-histidyl]riboflavin. It is therefore concluded that the FAD moiety of thiamin dehydrogenase is covalently linked via the 8alpha-methylene group to the N(1) position of the imidazole ring of histidine."
https://openalex.org/W1516406303,"The mutations in hemoglobin Nancy beta145(HC2) Tyr leads to Asp and hemoglobin Cochin-Portal-Royal beta146(HC3) His leads to Arg involve residues which are thought to be essential for the full expression of allosteric action in hemoglobin. Relative to the structure of deoxyhemoglobin A, our x-ray study of deoxyhemoglobin Nancy shows severe disordering of the beta chain COOH-terminal tetrapeptide and a possible movement of the beta heme iron atom toward the plane of the porphyrin ring. These structural perturbations result in a high oxygen affinity, reduced Bohr effect, and lack of cooperatively in hemoglobin Nancy. In the presence of inositol hexaphosphate (IHP), the Hill constant for hemoglobin Nancy increases from 1.1 to 2.0. But relative to its action on hemoglobin A, IHP is much less effective in reducing the oxygen affinity and in increasing the Bohr effect of hemoglobin Nancy. This indicates that IHP does not influence the R in equilibrium T equilibrium as much in hemoglobin Nancy as in hemoglobin A, and this probably is due to the disordering of His 143beta which is known to be part of the IHP binding site. IHP is also known to produce large changes in the absorption spectrum of methemoglobin A, but we find that it has no effect on the spectrum of methemoglobin Nancy. In contrast to the large structural changes in deoxyhemoglobin Nancy, the structure of deoxyhemoglobin Cochin-Port-Royal differs from deoxyhemoglobin A only in the position of the side chain of residue 146beta. The intrasubunit salt bridge between His 146beta and Asp 94beta in deoxyhemoglobin A is lost in deoxyhemoglobin Cochin-Portal-Royal with the guanidinium ion of Arg 146beta floating freely in solution. This small difference in structure results in a reduced Bohr effect, but does not cause a change in the Hill coefficient, the response to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, or the oxygen affinity at physiological pH."
https://openalex.org/W1502389397,"The genetic trait of responsiveness, which refers to the capacity for induction of cytochrome P-448 and numerous monooxygenase activities by certain aromatic hydrocarbons, is known to segregate almost exclusively as a single autosomal dominant gene among progeny of appropriate crosses originating from the responsive C57BL/6 and the nonresponsive DBA/2 inbred mouse strains. In this report the allele for responsiveness is shown to be associated with (a) increases in the apparent KS values for metyrapone bound to reduced P-450; (b) increases in the ethylisocyanide difference ratio (deltaA455-490/deltaA430-490);(c) increases in the deltaA455-490 per mg of microsomal protein but not in the deltaA430-490 per mg of protein from the reduced P-450-ethylisocyanide complex; (d) an approximately 2-nm hypsochromic shift in the spectral maximum in the 446 nm region for the reduced P-450-metyrapone complex; (e) an approximately 2-nm hypsochromic shift of the absorption maximum in the 455 nm region, but not of the maximum in the 430 nm region, for the reduced P-450-ethylisocyanide complex; and (f) larger increases in the deltaA455-490 than in the deltaA430-490 per mg of microsomal protein for the reduced P450-ethylisocyanide complex as a function of increasing pH. All of these phenomena are felt to be associated with the genetically regulated induction of liver microsomal cytochrome P-448 by polycyclic aromatic compounds. Whereas increases in the total hepatic P-450 content appear to be expressed almost exclusively as a single autosomal dominant trait, the increase in apparent KS value for metyrapone bound to reduced P-450 appears to be expressed additively. The reason for this finding is unclear. The increase in apparent KS value for metyrapone in 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats is known to occur even when the induction process is presumably blocked by treating the rat concomitantly with cycloheximide. Several lines of evidence in this report indicate that, although total P-450 content does not increase in C57BL/6N mice treated with 3-methylcholanthrene plus cycloheximide, hepatic P-448 induction does occur; P-448 induction does not occur in DBA/2N mice under these same conditions. These results indicate that cytochrome P-448 induction is relatively resistant to the inhibition of protein synthesis and that a responsive animal treated with 3-methylcholanthrene plus cycloheximide cannot be considered experimentally the same as a genetically nonresponsive animal treated with 3-methylcholanthrene alone."
https://openalex.org/W2127801735,"A type C hexokinase (ATP:D-hexose-6-phosphotransferase EC 2.7.1.1) was partially purified from the liver of the frog Calyptocephalella caudiverbera. The enzyme is inhibited by glucose levels in the range of normal blood sugar concentrations. The extent of the inhibition by glucose depends on the concentration of ATP, being most marked between 1 and 5 mM ATP. Fructose, although a substrate, was not inhibitory of its own phosphorylation. The inhibitory effect of high glucose levels exhibited a strong, reversible pH dependence being most marked at pH 6.5. At pH 7.5 the inhibition by high glucose levels was a function of the enzyme concentration, the effect being stronger at high enzyme concentrations, whereas no inhibition was observed when assaying very diluted preparations. At all enzyme concentrations studied, high levels of glucose caused no inhibition at pH 8.5, whereas at pH 6.5 strong inhibition was always observed. Short times of photooxidation of hexokinase C as well as incubation with low concentrations of p-chloromercuribenzoate resulted in the loss of the inhibition by excess of glucose. Glucose-6-phosphate was found to be a strong inhibitor of hexokinase C but only at high glucose levels. The inhibitory effect of glucose-6-P follows sigmoidal kinetics at low (about 0.02 mM) glucose concentrations, the Hill coefficient being 2.3. The kinetics of the inhibition became hyperbolic at high (greater than 0.2 mM) glucose levels. These results suggest that the inhibition of hexokinase C by excess glucose is due to the interaction of glucose with a second, aldose-specific, regulatory site on the enzyme. The modification of the inhibitory effect by ATP, glucose-6-P, enzyme concentration, and pH, all of them at physiological levels, indicates a major role for hexokinase C in the regulation of glucose utilization by the liver."
https://openalex.org/W2402290447,"Some preparations of both native aspartate transcarbamylase from Escherichia coli and catalytic subunit have fewer tight binding sites per oligomer for carbamyl-P than the number of catalytic peptide chains. In contrast, the number of sites for the tight-binding inhibitor N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate does equal the number of catalytic chains in each case. Binding of the labile carbamyl-P was determined using rapid gel filtration, with conversion to stable carbamyl-L-aspartate during collection. Native enzyme (six catalytic chains) obtained from cells grown under the conditions of J.C. Gerhart and H. Holoubek (J. Biol. Chem.

At pH 8.0, catalytic subunit (three catalytic chains) obtained from the former native enzyme has 2.2 tight sites for carbamyl-P (KD = 2.4 muM) and the number of sites is 2.3 in the presence of 35 mM succinate, whereas catalytic subunit obtained from the latter native enzyme has 1.8 tight sites (KD = 3.6 muM) in the absence of succinate and 2.3 tight sites in its presence. The number of tight binding sites is also less than the number of subunit peptide chains in 19F nuclear magnetic resonance experiments performed with catalytic subunit and two fluorinated analogs of carbamyl-P at comparable concentrations of analogs and active sites. A model is proposed in which incomplete removal of formylmethionine from the NH2 termini of the enzyme under conditions of extreme depression affects affinity for ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1547964373,"Measurements are reported on certain isotopic fluxes during the net conversion of glutamine, ADP and Pi to glutamate, NH3, and ATP by Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase (adenylylated form, Mn2+ activated) in presence of a hexokinase/glucose trap to remove the ATP formed during the reaction. The results show that the transfer of oxygens from Pi to glutamine is the most rapid of the measured isotopic interchanges, over five oxygens from Pi being transferred to glutamine for each glutamate formed by net reaction. Under similar conditions, the oxygen transfer from Pi to glutamate, was stimulated somewhat by an increase in the glutamate concentration but inhibited by an increase in the ammonia concentration. The enzyme from brain or peas did not show the rapid transfer of 18O from Pi to glutamine shown by the E. coli enzyme. Deductions are also made from the data about the availability of the oxygens of gamma-carboxyl of bound glutamate for reaction. The most logical explanation of the results with the E. coli enzyme is that the gamma-carboxyl group of bound glutamate has sufficient rotational freedom so that under conditions of rapid substrate interconversion either carboxylate oxygen can participate in the reaction. The results with the pea enzyme are consistent with hindered rotation of the gamma-care additional findings make likely a relative order of certain catalytic steps for the E. coli enzyme as follows: ATP release less than NH3 release less than glutamate release less than substrate interconversion less than glutamine release and Pi release and glutamate release less than ADP release."

Substrates of the electron transport chain could energize the phosphorylation of ADP, with the order of effectiveness being D-lactate greater than reduced phenazinemethosulfate greater than succinate greater than reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Inhibitors of D-lactate oxidation, proton conductors, and inhibitor of the Mg2+ATPase (EC 3.6.1.3) all inhibited oxidative phosphorylation when coupled to D-lactate oxidation. ATP synthesis was absent in membrane vesicles prepared from a mutant strain lacking the Mg2+ATPase. Valinomycin or nigericin partially inhibited oxidative phosphorylation in the presence of potassium. Valinomycin plus nigericin completely inhibited ATP synthesis. The effect of various agents on the respiration-dependent establishment of a transmembrane pH gradient was also examined. NaCN and carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone inhibited the establishment of a pH gradient while dicyclohexylcarbodiimide had no effect.

The accumulation of a soluble acidic protein unique to the nervous system (S-100) in media buffered with organic buffers was optimal in the pH range 6.4 to 6.8, significantly more acid than that optimal for cell growth (pH 7.0 to 7.8). Cells maintained in CO2-bicarbonate-buffered media exhibited a higher and less marked pH optimum for S-100 protein accumulation and a lower efficiency of accumulation of the protein. These data suggest that the organic buffer ions themselves, apart from their function as buffers, are influencing the accumulation of S-100. The specific activity (assayed at the enzymatic pH optimum) of a membrane-bound enzyme enriched in glial cells and myelin, 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase, was markedly pH-dependent. The optimal pH range was 6.4 to 6.7 in organic buffer controlled media. In CO2-bicarbonate controlled media the optimal pH range was only slightly higher (pH 6.6 to 7.0), but the specific activities were reduced relative to organic buffer-grown cells.

At 12 degrees, the composite sites split into two subsets: a pair of sites with a KD of 0.3 muM and a third site with a Kd of 1.1 muM. At lower temperatures (5 degrees or 2 degrees), the site with weak affinity disappears, leaving a pair of sites with a Kd of 0.5 muM. Similar observations were made when the enzyme was modified with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a specific and selective inhibitor of fatty acyl-CoA deacylase (s) of the pigeon liver enzyme complex (Kumar, S. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 5150-5158). Partial modification with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride elicits a NADPH binding response similar to the binding observed at 12 degrees, i.e. two sets of binding sites with nonidentical dissociation constants. Further modification corresponding to the complete loss of deacylase function results in a set of two apparently identical binding sites, and the third site is not available for titration. The modified enzyme retains the two reductase functions as measured by the model substrates, acetoacetyl-N-acetylcysteamine and crotonyl-CoA. Furthermore, the addition of acetyl- and malonyl-CoA (100 muM each) to the modified enzyme lowers the NADPH binding affinity by a factor of 3. Other observations show that the quantum yield, as measured by the ratio of fluorescence intensity of bound and free NADPH, changes with temperature and ionic strength. Lowering the temperature from 30 degrees to 2 degrees increases the enhancement ratio by 50%, whereas increase in ionic strength from 0.05 to 0.2 M potassium phosphate lowers it to 50% of the original level. Measurement of NADPH binding in the presence of NADP+, NADH, NAD+ and adenosine-2'-monophospho-5'-diphosphoribose demonstrates that NADP+ shows competitive behavior for NADPH sites (KD = 10.6 muM), whereas NADH and NAD+ show noncompetitive (KD (apparent) = nearly 600 muM) and rather complicated interactions implicating nonspecific conformational alteration of the enzyme complex. The behavior of adenosine 2'-monophospho-5'-diphosphoribose is intermediate between NADP+ and NADH. These data are discussed in terms of substrate-mediated conformational changes and the moles of each of the reductase enzymes per mole of the enzyme complex, the polarity of the NADPH binding region, and the probable structure of the nicotinamide moiety when bound to the enzyme."
