Lepidopterous larvae (Manduca sexta and Heliothis zea) and aphids (Aphis gossypii) died when confined on 2-tridecanone-treated filter paper."
https://openalex.org/W2069280694,"Photooxidation of cumene (isopropylbenzene) and pyridine in dilute solution in natural waters gives products characteristic of reactions with alkylperoxy (RO2⋅) and hydroxyl (HO⋅) radicals. On the basis of the rates of formation of the products, the average concentrations of RO2⋅ and HO⋅ are estimated to be about 10-9 and 10-17 mole per liter, respectively. The concentration of RO2⋅ is large enough that, for some classes of reactive chemicals, oxidation can be an important process in natural waters."
https://openalex.org/W2007628389,"Precursory changes in the radon concentration of groundwater were observed prior to the Izu-Oshima-kinkai earthquake (magnitude 7.0) 14 January 1978. The distance from the epicenter to a continuous radon-monitoring station at Nakaizu was about 25 kilometers. A sudden drop and a subsequent increase in the radon concentration recorded on 9 January 1978 were significant. The size of the spike-like change was about 15 percent. After the earthquake, a remarkable increase in the radon concentration occurred."

This figure agrees, within estimated error, with the value obtained from charts of energy exchange between ocean and atmosphere but is smaller by a factor of 2 than the recent value derived from satellite radiation measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2069411259,"Inactive female corpora allata implanted into adult males become active and continue to synthesize juvenile hormone at high rates. However, when an ovary is implanted together with the corpora allata, rates of juvenile hormone synthesis decline as the oocytes complete maturation. Injections of ecdysterone mimic the effect of an implanted ovary."
https://openalex.org/W2072713572,"The late Mesozoic rock and life records implicate short-term (up to 10(5) to 10(6) years) global warming resulting from carbon dioxide-induced ""greenhouse"" conditions in the late Maestrichtian extinctions that terminated the Mesozoic Era. Oxygen isotope data from marine microfossils suggest late Mesozoic climatic cooling into middle Maestrichtian, and warming thereafter into the Cenozoic. Animals adapting to climatic cooling could not adapt to sudden warming. Small calcareous marine organisms would have suffered solution effects of carbon dioxide-enriched waters; animals dependent upon them for food would also have been affected. The widespread terrestrial tropical floras would likely not have reflected effects of a slight climatic warming. In late Mesozoic, the deep oceanic waters may have been triggered into releasing vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in a chain reaction of climatic warming and carbon dioxide expulsion. These conditions may be duplicated by human combustion of the fossil fuels and by forest clearing."
https://openalex.org/W2018172130,"A strain of Rhizobium japonicum used in commercial inoculants was mutagenized and screened by a rapid effectiveness assay with soybean plants. Two mutant strains nodulated the roots earlier than the wild type and also expressed greater symbiotic nitrogen-fixing activity than the wild type in the presence and absence of fixed nitrogen. In addition, one of the mutants formed more root nodules than the wild type. Plants inoculated with these strains had increased dry weights ( approximately 60 percent) and nitrogen content ( approximately 100 percent) when grown in growth chambers."
https://openalex.org/W2022581202,"Some Malpighiaceae produce minute cleistogamous flowers in addition to showy chasmogamous flowers. Standard techniques fail to reveal how the cleistogamous flowers achieve self-fertilization. Fluorescence in longitudinal sections shows that the pollen germinates inside the indehiscent anther. The pollen tubes then grow down through the filament,. into the receptacle, up into the carpels, and into the nucellar beak of the ovule."
https://openalex.org/W1973444459,"In common with many arthropods, the true bug, Leptoglossus phyllopus, when disturbed, emits a two-phase secretion that consists of an organic phase and an aqueous phase. The organic phase is a mixture of highly reactive low-molecular-weight compounds, analogous to those produced by other arthropods, and is deterrent to many kinds of predators. The aqueous phase, heretofore ignored in most analyses of arthropod defensive secretions, contains proteins. Even though the secretion is not injected, the proteins enzymatically catalyze the derivation of the most reactive components within the impermeable cuticular storage reservoir and, thus, constitute part of the defensive system that appears to be commonly used by arthropods producing irritating chemicals."
https://openalex.org/W2039032029,Seismic velocities measured in rock deformed in the laboratory show excellent agreement with theoretical predictions of the effects of crack growth during dilatancy. Under appropriate conditions dilatancy was observed to produce a drop in the ratio of the seismic compressional velocity to the seismic shear velocity both by the mechanism of undersaturation and by a liquid-gas phase transition.
https://openalex.org/W2044630982,"Formic acid synthesis in the poison gland of Camponotus pennsylvanicus is closely related to the C-1 metabolism of the glandular cells. Serine, glycine, and histidine are potential C-1 donors to formic acid by several tetrahydrofolate intermediates. Formic acid is accumulated by its transfer to an insulated reservoir, so that the ant avoids the acid's cytotoxicity. This combination of biochemical and morphological features provides an autodefensive mechanism. Possible factors that regulate the biosynthesis of formic acid in the poison gland apparatus are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2016324373,"Loblolly pine trees 3 to 7 years old grown in a heated greenhouse under a 20-hour photoperiod had quiescent buds induced by lowering the temperature and shortening the photoperiod. This treatment resulted in the formation of both male and female strobili. Overall, 38 percent of the ramets produced females, and 68 percent produced males. There was no significant difference in the frequency of flowering among 3-, 5-, and 7-year-old scions."

https://openalex.org/W1992356805,"Increase in information flow is driving a technology search for new data storage methods and media. Storage in holograms may provide an increase in density of two orders of magnitude over microfiche, for example. The inherent redundancy of holograms, wherein each bit of information is recorded over the entire hologram, reduces the danger of loss of data. Commercial technology being developed by three companies is described. Currently used media are compared briefly according to data density and cost."

https://openalex.org/W2005642934,"A response to an article by L.J. Carter and letters by T. S. Wyman and A. McKenzie showed that 85% of all shipping accidents result from human error, so that this is an area that should be emphasized. The individuals who operate tankers must be tested and retrained and stricter standards must be enforced in regard to the number of hours a person may be in control of a tanker. The number of accidents that have occurred and the number projected in the future make it clear that vessel traffic control systems should be installed along our entire coast, and especially in those heavily congested areas near harbors. The projected increase in the numbers of tankers and oil platforms in the Santa Barbara channel sets the stage for the collision of an oil tanker with a producing platform, particularly when those platforms are located between traffic lanes. Yet the U.S. Coast Guard's position is that the situation is not serious enough to invest in traffic control. However, the cost of installing and maintaining that control is far less than the cost of cleaning up after one disaster."
