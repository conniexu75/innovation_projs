However, to date it is not known whether macroautophagy functions as a protective pathway, contributes to programmed cell death, or is an irrelevant event during cardiac I/R injury. We employed simulated I/R of cardiac HL-1 cells as an in vitro model of I/R injury to the heart. To assess macroautophagy, we quantified autophagosome generation and degradation (autophagic flux), as determined by steady-state levels of autophagosomes in relation to lysosomal inhibitor-mediated accumulation of autophagosomes. We found that I/R impaired both formation and downstream lysosomal degradation of autophagosomes. Overexpression of Beclin1 enhanced autophagic flux following I/R and significantly reduced activation of pro-apoptotic Bax, whereas RNA interference knockdown of Beclin1 increased Bax activation. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were protective against I/R injury, and expression of a Beclin1 Bcl-2/-xL binding domain mutant resulted in decreased autophagic flux and did not protect against I/R injury. Overexpression of Atg5, a component of the autophagosomal machinery downstream of Beclin1, did not affect cellular injury, whereas expression of a dominant negative mutant of Atg5 increased cellular injury. These results demonstrate that autophagic flux is impaired at the level of both induction and degradation and that enhancing autophagy constitutes a powerful and previously uncharacterized protective mechanism against I/R injury to the heart cell.

Autophagy involves processes for the turnover of long lived macromolecules and organelles via the lysosomal degradative pathway (1Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (2988) Google Scholar, 2Cuervo A.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 263: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Macroautophagy (referred to hereafter as autophagy) is a specific mode of autophagy in which isolation membranes envelop a portion of the cytosol, containing nonspecific cytosolic components, selectively targeted toxic protein aggregates (3Ravikumar B. Vacher C. Berger Z. Davies J.E. Luo S. Oroz L.G. Scaravilli F. Easton D.F. Duden R. O'Kane C.J. Rubinsztein D.C. Nat.

Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The autophagosomes are then delivered to the lysosome, forming the autophagolysosome, for subsequent degradation of their contents by lysosomal hydrolases (Fig. 10). Interest in autophagy has increased recently, because of the recognition of its involvement in caspase-independent programmed cell death (PCD 2The abbreviations used are: PCD, programmed cell death; AVs, autophagic vacuoles; GFP, green fluorescent protein; KH, Krebs-Henseleit; 3-MA, 3-methyladenine; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; I/R, ischemia/reperfusion; sI/R, simulated ischemia/reperfusion; RNAi, RNA interference; PI3P, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. type II) and its regulation by components of the apoptotic death pathway (PCD type I) (7Saeki K.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL have been linked to the autophagic pathway via an interaction with Beclin1, a key mediator of autophagic activity (9Shimizu S. Kanaseki T. Mizushima N. Mizuta T. Arakawa-Kobayashi S. Thompson C.B. Tsujimoto Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar, 10Liang X.H. Kleeman L.K. Jiang H.H. Gordon G. Goldman J.E. Berry G. Herman B. Levine B. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8586-8596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Autophagy is a vital process in the heart, presumably participating in the removal of dysfunctional cytosolic components and serving as a catabolic energy source during times of starvation. For example, autophagy in cardiac myocytes has been suggested to provide a necessary source of energy between birth and suckling (11Kuma A. Hatano M. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakaya H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Tokuhisa T. Mizushima N. Nature. 2004; 432: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (2405) Google Scholar), and in a GFP-LC3 transgenic mouse, cardiac myocytes from starved animals displayed high numbers of autophagosomes, some of which contained mitochondria (12Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Matsui M. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar). On the other hand, impaired autophagy may play a causative role in cardiac disease. Incomplete autophagic removal of mitochondria may be the source of lipofuscin, a toxic waste product that builds up during the life span (13Brunk U.T. Terman A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1996-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), and chronic impairment of the lysosome results in reduced myocardial function (14Saftig P. Tanaka Y. Lullmann-Rauch R. von Figura K. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 37-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, disruption of the autophagic pathway may contribute to cardiac cell death under conditions where lysosomal integrity is lost and lysosomal proteases are released into the cytosol (15Decker R.S. Wildenthal K. Am. J. Pathol. 1980; 98: 425-444PubMed Google Scholar). In the study presented here, we investigated the role and regulation of autophagy during ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Following a bout of ischemia (a reduction of blood flow resulting in oxygen and nutrient starvation), reperfusion must be achieved in order to rescue affected tissue. However, reperfusion can activate pathways that either preserve cell viability (preconditioning) or lead to cell death (I/R injury). Autophagy may be a protective response to I/R injury, as increased prevalence of autophagosomes has been documented in response to sub-lethal ischemia in the perfused heart (15Decker R.S. Wildenthal K. Am. J. Pathol. 1980; 98: 425-444PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it was recently reported that increased Beclin1 expression in the heart correlated with the onset of protection in an in vivo model of myocardial stunning (16Yan L. Vatner D.E. Kim S.J. Ge H. Masurekar M. Massover W.H. Yang G. Matsui Y. Sadoshima J. Vatner S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13807-13812Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The cardiac HL-1 cell line was subjected to simulated I/R (sI/R) as an in vitro model of I/R injury to the heart. Using three-dimensional high resolution fluorescence imaging, we analyzed the autophagic response to sI/R. Our results indicate that in HL-1 cardiac myocytes subjected to sI/R, autophagic flux is impaired at the level of both induction and degradation, yet remains a vital underlying protective response against sI/R injury. Moreover, increasing autophagic capacity of the cardiac myocyte is protective against sI/R injury. Reagents—3-Methyladenine, wortmannin, rapamycin, pepstatin A methyl ester, E64D, and bafilomycin A1 were purchased from EMD Biosciences. Cell Culture and Transfections—Cells of the atrially derived cardiac cell line HL-1 (17Claycomb W.C. Lanson Jr., N.A. Stallworth B.S. Egeland D.B. Delcarpio J.B. Bahinski A. Izzo Jr., N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2979-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar) were plated in gelatin/fibronectin-coated culture vessels and maintained in Claycomb medium (JRH Biosciences) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm norepinephrine, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. Cells were transfected with the indicated vectors using the transfection reagents Effectene (Qiagen) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions, achieving at least 40 and 60% transfection efficiency, respectively. RNA Interference—Sequences with 100% homology to regions within the open reading frame of mouse Beclin1 (gi: 27764874) were generated using the BLOCK-iT™ RNAi Designer, a construct that embeds a small hairpin RNA within a micro RNA fold, which is then processed by the endogenous RNAi machinery (18Amarzguioui M. Rossi J.J. Kim D. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5974-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The obtained target sequences, 5′-tgaaacttcagacccatctta-3′ (a) and 5′-taatggagctgtgagttcctg-3′ (b), showed no significant homology to other mouse proteins as determined by Blast analysis. The sequence was used to generate oligonucleotide pairs, which were inserted into the pcDNA™6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR, which has co-cistronic expression of EmGFP, allowing for determination of transfection efficiency by fluorescence microscopy. The vectors, pcDNA™6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR-Beclin1 (a) and -Beclin1 (b), were sequence-verified, and cells were co-transfected with both vectors to achieve maximal knockdown. To control for nonspecific RNAi effects, the construct pcDNA™6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR-LacZ (targeting β-galactosidase) was used as a control. Simulated Ischemia/Reperfusion (sI/R)—Cells were plated in 14-mm diameter glass bottom microwell dishes (MatTek), and ischemia was introduced by a buffer exchange to ischemia-mimetic solution (in mm: 125 NaCl, 8 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1.25 MgSO4, 1.2 CaCl2, 6.25 NaHCO3, 5 sodium lactate, 20 HEPES, pH 6.6) and placing the dishes in hypoxic pouches (GasPak™ EZ, BD Biosciences) equilibrated with 95% N2, 5% CO2. After 2 h of ischemia, reperfusion was initiated by a buffer exchange to normoxic Krebs-Henseleit solution (KH, in mm: 110 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1.25 MgSO4, 1.2 CaCl2, 25 NaHCO3, 15 glucose, 20 HEPES, pH 7.4) and incubation at 95% room air, 5% CO2. Controls incubated in normoxic KH solution were run in parallel for each condition for periods of time that corresponded with those of the experimental groups. Under control conditions cell viability was not compromised. Wide Field Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were observed through a Nikon TE300 fluorescence microscope (Nikon) equipped with a ×10 lens (0.3 N.A., Nikon), a ×40 Plan Fluor, and a ×60 Plan Apo objective (1.4 N.A. and 1.3 N.A. oil immersion lenses; Nikon), a Z-motor (ProScanII, Prior Scientific), a cooled CCD camera (Orca-ER, Hamamatsu), and automated excitation and emission filter wheels controlled by a LAMBDA 10–2 (Sutter Instrument) operated by MetaMorph 6.2r4 (Universal Imaging). Fluorescence was excited through an excitation filter for fluorescein isothiocyanate (HQ480/×40) and Texas Red (D560/×40). Fluorescent light was collected via a polychroic beam splitter (61002bs) and an emission filter for fluorescein isothiocyanate (HQ535/50m) and Texas Red (D630/60m). All filters were from Chroma. Acquired wide field Z-stacks were routinely deconvolved using 10 iterations of a three-dimensional blind deconvolution algorithm (AutoQuant) to maximize spatial resolution. Unless stated otherwise, representative images shown are maximum projections of Z-stacks taken with 0.3- μm increments capturing total cellular volume. Quantification of Cellular Autophagosome Content—LC3 forms I and II are known to be differentially recognized by the LC3 antibodies (19Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Oshitani-Okamoto S. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2805-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in our hands immunodetection of endogenous LC3 in HL-1 cells was inconclusive (data not shown). Therefore, cellular contents of autophagosomal structures were quantified via fluorescence imaging of GFP-LC3 (20Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5468) Google Scholar) or mCherry-LC3. To generate pmCherry-LC3, mCherry was amplified from the pRSET-mCherry vector (21Shaner N.C. Campbell R.E. Steinbach P.A. Giepmans B.N. Palmer A.E. Tsien R.Y. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1567-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (3507) Google Scholar) and swapped with enhanced GFP of the vector pEGFP-LC3 (20Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5468) Google Scholar); HL-1 cells were transfected with (mCherry-/)GFP-LC3, and 48 h after transfection, cells were subjected to sI/R as indicated. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, for 15 min. To quantify the autophagic response in a population of cells, cells were inspected at ×60 magnification and classified as either having predominantly diffuse (mCherry-/)GFP-LC3 fluorescence or as having numerous punctate (mCherry-/)GFP-LC3 structures, representing autophagic vacuoles, AVs. At least 150 cells were scored in each of three or more independent experiments. For quantification of the autophagic response of single cells, Z-stacks of (mCherry-/)GFP-LC3 fluorescence of 7–10 representative cells per condition in three separate experiments were acquired through the ×60 oil immersion lens with 0.3-μm increments through the entire volume of the cell. Z-stacks were thresholded, and total number and volume of the autophagosome per cell were determined (AutoQuant). Determination of LC3-II Degradation—To analyze autophagic flux, (mCherry-/)GFP-LC3-expressing cells were subjected to the indicated experimental conditions with and without a mixture of the cell-permeable lysosomal inhibitors bafilomycin A1 (100 nm, vacuolar H+-ATPase inhibitor) to inhibit autophagosome-lysosome fusion (22Yamamoto A. Tagawa Y. Yoshimori T. Moriyama Y. Masaki R. Tashiro Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1998; 23: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar), E64D (5 μg/ml, inhibitor of cysteine proteases, including cathepsin B), and pepstatin A methyl ester (5 μg/ml, cathepsin D inhibitor) to inhibit lysosomal protease activity. Fluorescence microscopy of GFP-LC3 was used to determine cellular autophagosomal content as described above. Activity of the Lysosomal Compartment—LysoTracker Red is a cell-permeable acidotropic probe that selectively labels vacuoles with low internal pH and thus can be used to label functional lysosomes (23Bucci C. Thomsen P. Nicoziani P. McCarthy J. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Following sI/R and control experiments, cells were loaded with 50 nm LysoTracker Red for 5 min in KH solution; the medium was then exchanged with dye-free KH solution, and cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Activity and intracellular distribution of cathepsin B, a predominant lysosomal protease, were assessed using (z-RR)2-MagicRed-Cathepsin B substrate (B-Bridge). MagicRed cathepsin B substrate was added to the cells during the last 30 min of an experiment according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantification of Cellular Injury—GFP-Bax (24Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar) or mCherry-Bax (25Brady N.R. Hamacher-Brady A. Gottlieb R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) distribution was used as a parameter to quantify irreversible cellular injury. Cells were cotransfected with (mCherry-/)GFP-Bax and the indicated vectors and allowed to express for 48 h. Cells were then subjected to 2 h of ischemia in hypoxic pouches followed by 5 h of reperfusion, and live cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Cells were classified as cells with either diffuse or punctate mitochondrial (mCherry-/)GFP-Bax fluorescence. Approximately 300 transfected cells per condition were scored at ×60 magnification in each of three independent experiments. Immunoblotting—Cells were harvested by scraping and centrifugation at 550 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. To prepare whole cell lysates, cell pellets were suspended in cold RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and left on ice for 20 min. The cell extracts were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min to remove cellular debris. After addition of sample buffer and reducing agent (Bio-Rad), samples were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min, electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Immunodetection was performed using antibodies against actin (clone AC-40; Sigma), Bcl-2 (C-2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Bcl-xL (H-5, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Beclin1 (D-18; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and fluorescent protein (BD Biosciences). Attempts to detect endogenous LC3-I and -II using F-14 and H-50 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and A0973 (Biosignatures) antibodies were unsatisfactory because of inconsistencies in immunoreactivity and nonspecificity, perhaps due to the fact that these are mouse antibodies being used against mouse proteins. Blots shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. Statistics—The probability of statistical differences between experimental groups was determined by the Student's t test. Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments unless stated otherwise. sI/R Induces Programmed Cell Death in HL-1 Cardiac Myocytes—The HL-1 cell line is an excellent model for studying many aspects of cardiac cell physiology (26White S.M. Constantin P.E. Claycomb W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H823-H829Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In our hands HL-1 cells reproducibly underwent PCD in response to simulated I/R via pathways resembling in vivo cardiac I/R injury (25Brady N.R. Hamacher-Brady A. Gottlieb R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). One key feature of sI/R-induced cell death is the participation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bax in the mitochondrial death pathway. Bax activation, a point-of-noreturn in the PCD pathway, is reflected by a redistribution from the cytosol to punctate clusters at the mitochondria and can be quantified via fluorescent imaging of a GFP-Bax fusion protein (Fig. 1A) (24Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar). Using GFP-Bax redistribution as an index to monitor activation of PCD, we found that sI/R induced PCD in a hypoxia/reoxygenation-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Overexpression of both Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, known protectors against cardiac I/R injury (27Brocheriou V. Hagege A.A. Oubenaissa A. Lambert M. Mallet V.O. Duriez M. Wassef M. Kahn A. Menasche P. Gilgenkrantz H. J. Gene Med. 2000; 2: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 28Huang J. Nakamura K. Ito Y. Uzuka T. Morikawa M. Hirai S. Tomihara K. Tanaka T. Masuta Y. Ishii K. Kato K. Hamada H. Circulation. 2005; 112: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29Imahashi K. Schneider M.D. Steenbergen C. Murphy E. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 734-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), significantly reduced sI/R-induced GFP-Bax redistribution, further demonstrating suitability of the model (Fig. 1, C and D). Cellular Autophagosomal Content Is Increased during the Early Phase of sI/R Injury—We used HL-1 cells to explore the role of autophagy during sI/R injury. To determine whether autophagic activity is modulated in response to sI/R, we first characterized changes in cellular autophagosomal content using high resolution three-dimensional imaging of GFP-LC3. During the initiation of autophagy, cytosolic LC3 (LC3-I) is cleaved and lipidated to form LC3-II (19Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Oshitani-Okamoto S. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2805-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 30Tanida I. Minematsu-Ikeguchi N. Ueno T. Kominami E. Autophagy. 2005; 1: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). LC3-II is then recruited to the autophagosomal membrane (31Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Thus, punctate GFP-LC3-labeled structures represent autophagosomes, also referred to as autophagic vacuoles (AVs). Importantly, overexpression of (GFP-)LC3 does not affect autophagic activity, and transgenic mice expressing GFP-LC3 display no detectable abnormalities (12Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Matsui M. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar, 32Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). We transfected HL-1 cardiac myocytes with GFP-LC3 and compared the abundance of AVs in cells subjected to sI/R to normoxic control cells. Under normoxic conditions in KH solution, GFP-LC3 was diffusely distributed throughout the cell, with very few detectable AVs (Fig. 2A, upper panel). Cells subjected to sI/R, however, displayed increased numbers of AVs (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). In addition, in control cells the few pre-existing AVs were randomly distributed, whereas AVs in cells subjected to sI/R were typically more clustered at the center of the cell. This distinctive distribution contrasts with the autophagic response to starvation in hepatocytes, where no such clustering was observed (33Kochl R. Hu X.W. Chan E.Y. Tooze S.A. Traffic. 2006; 7: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). To quantify the increase in GFP-LC3-labeled AVs, the percentage of cells displaying numerous punctate GFP-LC3 structures was determined. Only a small fraction of cells displayed punctate GFP-LC3 fluorescence when incubated in fully supplemented medium or KH solution (Fig. 2B). In cells subjected to sI/R, however, the number of cells with numerous AVs was significantly increased (Fig. 2B). Quantitative analysis performed on Z-stacks of GFP-LC3 fluorescence revealed that sI/R significantly increased the number of AVs per cell and, likewise, the total autophagosomal volume (Fig. 2C). Changes in Autophagic Activity during Ischemia and Reperfusion—Our results demonstrate that cellular AV content was increased early in the reperfusion period. We subsequently addressed the effect of sI/R on actual autophagic activity. Autophagy involves the delivery of the autophagosomes and their contents to lysosomes that contain the degradative enzymes needed to complete the catabolic processes of autophagy (1Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (2988) Google Scholar). Therefore, the increased presence of AVs may reflect enhanced formation of AVs, impaired fusion of AVs with lysosomes to generate autophagolysosomes, or a combination of the two. Moreover, LC3-II may be removed by lysosomal degradation at a rate that exceeds our imaging capabilities, i.e. the transit is so rapid and/or the AVs so small that only a few AVs can be detected at any given time. Accordingly, a low number of GFP-LC3-labeled AVs may be due to either low or high autophagic activity. To characterize autophagic activity, we therefore determined two relevant parameters of autophagosome-lysosome fusion, the index of LC3-II degradation and downstream lysosomal activity. Flux of LC3-II Degradation during sI/R—Using an approach based on the inhibition of downstream lysosomal degradation of AVs and their cargo, we determined whether the increase in cellular AVs during sI/R was indicative of increased or impaired autophagy. Cells were subjected to various experimental conditions and treated with a mixture of lysosomal inhibitors to inhibit autophagolysosome formation (with bafilomycin A1) and lysosomal protease activity (with E64D and pepstatin A). By analyzing the lysosomal inhibitor-mediated increase in GFP-LC3-II (AV) accumulation within a cell population, we were able to obtain a quantitative index of the flux of AV formation and degradation. Bar graphs with offset superimposed bars depict the percentage of cells exhibiting high AV levels in the absence and presence of lysosomal inhibitors, per condition. The difference between the two bars (see values in graphs) is a measure of the percentage of cells demonstrating high autophagic activity, or flux. We found that in KH solution AV content was dramatically increased in the presence of inhibitors (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, under control conditions in KH solution, which lacks the serum and amino acid component of full medium, autophagy was strongly active. Notably, this response is only revealed through the use of inhibitors; based on GFP-LC3 imaging alone (Fig. 2), low autophagic activity in KH solution would be incorrectly assumed. sI/R augmented the number of cells with increased numbers of AVs (Fig. 3B). Under lysosomal inhibition the number of cells with high AV content was increased only slightly more, indicating that the previously described increase in cellular AV content in sI/R (Fig. 2 and 3B) is a reflection of an accumulation of AVs, presumably due to impairment in the autophagic pathway at a point(s) following AV formation and before AV degradation. As the level of AV accumulation was substantially smaller than the inhibitor-mediated response seen in KH solution for the same period of time, it can be concluded that autophagy is also impaired at the level of AV formation. Most AVs were formed during the reperfusion period, as cells fixed immediately after the ischemic period were essentially devoid of AVs, either with or without lysosomal inhibitors, indicating a complete blockage of autophagy during the ischemic period (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, hypoxia was a necessary component of the insult, as cells incubated in ischemia/mimetic solution alone, under normoxic conditions, exhibited only a minor reduction of autophagic flux, which recovered completely upon reperfusion (Fig. 3B). Lysosomal Activity during sI/R—One possible explanation for the observed accumulation of AVs during sI/R was a nonfunctional lysosomal compartment. To investigate down-stream lysosomal activity, HL-1 cells were incubated in LysoTracker Red, which labels the highly acidic lysosomal vacuoles and thus reports activity of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (v-ATPase). Before and after sI/R, we observed similar patterns of LysoTracker Red fluorescence, indicating that, consistent with its importance in cell survival during I/R (34Karwatowska-Prokopczuk E. Nordberg J.A. Li H.L. Engler R.L. Gottlieb R.A. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1139-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), activity of the v-ATPase is maintained during the reperfusion period (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, we determined the activity and subcellular localization of cathepsin B, a predominant lysosomal protease, using a MagicRed substrate that fluoresces when cleaved by cathepsin B (35Lamparska-Przybysz M. Gajkowska B. Motyl T. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2005; 56: 159-179PubMed Google Scholar). We did not detect a decrease in cathepsin B activity following sI/R, as MagicRed fluorescence was still punctate (lysosomal) and displayed an intensity comparable with the normoxic control (Fig. 4B). Moreover, we found that cathepsin B activity was not detected in the cytosol, indicating that cathepsin B is not released from the lysosomes following sI/R. Together, these results indicate a functional lysosomal compartment durin"

Nonetheless, the senescence response is thought to be antagonistically pleiotropic and thus contribute to aging phenotypes, including, ironically, late life cancers. The cancer-promoting activity of senescent cells is likely due to secreted molecules, the identity of which remains largely unknown. Here, we have shown that senescent fibroblasts, much more than presenescent fibroblasts, stimulate tumor vascularization in mice. Weakly malignant epithelial cells co-injected with senescent fibroblasts had larger and greater numbers of blood vessels compared with controls. Accordingly, increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression was a frequent characteristic of senescent human and mouse fibroblasts in culture. Importantly, conditioned medium from senescent fibroblasts, more than medium from presenescent cells, stimulates cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells to invade a basement membrane, a hallmark of angiogenesis. Increased VEGF expression was specific to the senescent phenotype and increased whether senescence was induced by replicative exhaustion, overexpression of p16Ink4a, or overexpression of oncogenic RAS. The senescence-dependent increase in VEGF production was accompanied by very little increase in hypoxic-inducible (transcription) factor 1 α protein levels, and hypoxia further induced VEGF in senescent cells. This result suggests the rise in VEGF expression at senescence is not a hypoxic response. Our findings may in part explain why senescent cells stimulate tumorigenesis in vivo and support the idea that senescent cells may facilitate age-associated cancer development by secreting factors that promote malignant progression.

In complex organisms such as mammals, diverse stress can induce proliferative cells to either die by programmed cell death (apoptosis) or irreversibly withdraw from the cell cycle by a process termed cellular senescence. Both responses most likely evolved to suppress the proliferation of dysfunctional or damaged cells and hence the possibility of oncogenic transformation (1Campisi J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 27-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Whether a cell undergoes apoptosis or senescence can have important, yet different, physiological consequences, especially over the life span. Apoptosis effectively eliminates defective cells but can eventually lead to tissue atrophy. By contrast, senescent cells generally resist apoptosis and thus can accumulate in vivo (2Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O.M. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pathol. 2005; 205: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar); however, because they secrete biologically active molecules, these irreversibly growth-arrested cells can alter the behavior of neighboring cells (reviewed in Refs. 6Campisi J. Cell. 2005; 120: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar, 7Roninson I.B. Cancer Lett. 2002; 179: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Thus, both the apoptotic and senescence responses may be antagonistically pleiotropic, benefiting young organisms by protecting them from cancer early in life but causing detrimental effects later in life (1Campisi J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 27-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). A diversity of stresses can induce cellular senescence (reviewed in Ref. 8Serrano M. Blasco M.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 748-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). These include the dysfunctional telomeres that result from repeated cell division (replicative senescence), severe or irreparable DNA damage (genotoxic stress), the expression of certain oncogenes (oncogene-induced senescence), and agents or conditions that disrupt chromatin organization. Despite the disparate mechanisms by which these stresses act, senescent cells share numerous features, including an arrest of cell proliferation that cannot be reversed by physiological signals, an enlarged flattened morphology, expression of a neutral β-galactosidase (senescence-associated β-galactosidase), and an altered pattern of gene expression. The senescence response depends on the activities of two major tumor suppressor pathways, one controlled by p53 and another controlled by p16INK4a and pRB (reviewed in Ref. 6Campisi J. Cell. 2005; 120: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). We have shown that senescent stromal fibroblasts secrete factors that can alter the structure and function of normal epithelial tissue structures (9Parrinello S. Coppe J.P. Krtolica A. Campisi J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that senescent fibroblasts secrete factors that can stimulate the proliferation of premalignant epithelial cells in culture and facilitate their conversion to malignant tumors in vivo (10Krtolica A. Parrinello S. Lockett S. Desprez P.Y. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12072-12077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the senescence of stromal cells might cooperate with the acquisition of oncogenic mutations by epithelial cells to promote late life cancers (11DePinho R.A. Nature. 2000; 408: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Indirect support for this idea derives from studies of irradiated stromal cells. Sublethal irradiation of normal breast stroma increased the incidence of breast tumors in mice (12Barcellos-Hoff M.H. Ravani S.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1254-1260PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, irradiated fibroblasts produced factors that increased the invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells in culture (13Ohuchida K. Mizumoto K. Murakami M. Qian L.W. Sato N. Nagai E. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Tanaka M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3215-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). 2J. P. Coppé and J. Campisi, manuscript in preparation. 2J. P. Coppé and J. Campisi, manuscript in preparation. Because genotoxic stress, including irradiation, induces a senescence response, especially in fibroblasts (14Ben-Porath I. Weinberg R.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), it is likely in these studies that fibroblasts became senescent after irradiation. The identity of the cancer-promoting factors produced by senescent fibroblasts remains largely unknown. In some respects, the phenotype of senescent fibroblasts resembles that of tumor- or carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (15Olumi A.F. Grossfeld G.D. Hayward S.W. Carroll P.R. Tlsty T.D. Cunha G.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5002-5011PubMed Google Scholar), which are thought to provide factors that facilitate the ability of the developing carcinoma to invade and survive in the surrounding tissue. Recently, a mechanism by which tumor-associated fibroblasts promote cancer development was elucidated (16Orimo A. Gupta P.B. Sgroi D.C. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Delaunay T. Naeem R. Carey V.J. Richardson A.L. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2005; 121: 335-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2801) Google Scholar). This study showed that such fibroblasts might promote human breast cancer progression by secreting stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) 3The abbreviations used are: SDF-1, stromal cell-derived factor 1; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; HUVEC, human umbilical vascular endothelial cell; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; mBF, mouse breast fibroblast; vWF, von Willebrand factor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HIF-1α, hypoxic-inducible (transcription) factor 1 α. 3The abbreviations used are: SDF-1, stromal cell-derived factor 1; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; HUVEC, human umbilical vascular endothelial cell; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; mBF, mouse breast fibroblast; vWF, von Willebrand factor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HIF-1α, hypoxic-inducible (transcription) factor 1 α.. SDF-1 recruits endothelial progenitor cells and hence stimulates new blood vessel formation, or angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is considered one of six important steps required for the development of a malignant tumor (17Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21638) Google Scholar). Here, we have shown that senescent human lung fibroblasts may likewise promote tumorigenesis by stimulating angiogenesis but in this case by secreting elevated levels of angiogenic factors, one of which is the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We showed that fibroblast-secreted VEGF stimulates the invasiveness of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) in culture and that the presence of senescent fibroblasts increased the vascularization of tumors in mice. The elevated VEGF production by senescent fibroblasts was due in part to increased VEGF mRNA levels and occurred whether cells were induced to senesce by replicative exhaustion, expression of oncogenic RAS, or overexpression of p16INK4a. Further, senescent fibroblasts had only slightly elevated levels of HIF-1α, a transcription factor that induces VEGF expression in response to hypoxia (18Mukhopadhyay D. Datta K. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2004; 14: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and retained the ability to further induce VEGF in response to hypoxia. Our findings suggest that up-regulated VEGF expression comprises part of the senescent phenotype of some human fibroblasts, independent of the hypoxic response. Cells and Cell Culture—HUVECs (Clonetics) were cultivated in EGM-2 medium (Clonetics). Human WI-38 and IMR90 (fetal lung) and HCA2 and BJ (foreskin) fibroblasts were obtained, cultured, and passaged to senescence in atmospheric oxygen as described (19Dimri G.P. Itahana K. Acosta M. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 20Itahana K. Dimri G.P. Hara E. Itahana Y. Zou Y. Desprez P.Y. Campisi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18206-18214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Human and mouse breast fibroblasts and EpH4-v mouse epithelial tumor cells were obtained from Dr. M. Stampfer as primary fibroblasts from patients who underwent breast reduction, and as described (9Parrinello S. Coppe J.P. Krtolica A. Campisi J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 21Parrinello S. Samper E. Krtolica A. Goldstein J. Melov S. Campisi J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Cells were judged to be senescent as described (2Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O.M. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5558) Google Scholar, 19Dimri G.P. Itahana K. Acosta M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 18206-18214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). WI-38 cells were made quiescent by incubating for 72 h in growth medium supplemented with 0.2% fetal bovine serum as described (20Itahana K. Dimri G.P. Hara E. Itahana Y. Zou Y. Desprez P.Y. Campisi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18206-18214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For hypoxic conditions, cells were grown in a humidified chamber adjusted to 1% oxygen. Vectors and Viral Infections—Infectious virus was produced by transiently transfecting lenti and packaging vectors into 293T cells as described (22Naldini L. Blomer U. Gallay P. Ory D. Mulligan R. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Trono D. Science. 1996; 272: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (3937) Google Scholar). All lentiviral constructs (lenti-GFP, lenti-p16, lenti-Ha-RASv12) have been described (23Beausejour C.M. Krtolica A. Galimi F. Narita M. Lowe S.W. Yaswen P. Campisi J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Non-integrating lentiviruses were generated using the same method, except that a mutated integrase (D64V) plasmid (a gift from Dr. Robert Marr, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) was used (24Leavitt A.D. Robles G. Alesandro N. Varmus H.E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 721-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viral supernatants were concentrated by ultracentrifugation and titers determined by ELISA for p24, using a commercial kit (Zeptometrics). Cells were infected in the presence of 6 μg/ml polybrene at a multiplicity of infection of 50 unless otherwise indicated. Test infections using lenti-GFP showed that a multiplicity of infection of 25 gave infection efficiencies of >99%. Western Blotting and ELISA Assay—We performed Western analysis as described (19Dimri G.P. Itahana K. Acosta M. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) using the following primary antibodies, actin (Chemicon MAB1501), HIF-1α (BD Biosciences 610959). Secreted VEGF and SDF-1α protein concentrations were measured using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Quantikine; R&D Systems). Volumes of cell culture supernatants were normalized to the total number of cells present at the time of collection. Invasion Assay—Conditioned medium was collected by washing cells twice with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by a 48-h incubation in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. An equal number of cells were plated at the start of the experiment, and cell numbers were determined after the 48-h incubation; when necessary, conditioned medium volumes were normalized to the total number of cells present at the end of the 48-h period. 24-well format 8-μm cell culture inserts (BD Biosciences 354578) were coated with 12.5 μl of Matrigel (BD Biosciences 356234) diluted 1:1 with serum-free cell culture medium. The coated cell culture inserts were placed atop 300 μl of conditioned medium or serum-free medium + recombinant human VEGF. 1 × 105 HUVEC cells in 200 μl of serum-free medium were added on top of the Matrigel layer. HUVECs were preincubated in serum-free medium for 12 h prior to plating on Matrigel. HUVECs were allowed to invade the Matrigel for 36 h, after which they were fixed, stained, and counted. When indicated, conditioned medium was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml anti-human VEGF antibody (R&D Systems AF-293-NA). Human recombinant VEGF (15 ng/ml) was used as a positive control. Tumor Studies and vWF Immunostaining—Tumorigenic studies were performed as previously described (10Krtolica A. Parrinello S. Lockett S. Desprez P.Y. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12072-12077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). In brief, 0.75 million EpH4-v epithelial cells were injected in the presence (or absence) of one million primary mouse breast fibroblasts (MBF). 200 μl of serum-free medium containing resuspended cells was injected subcutaneously underneath the sixth nipple. After 60 days, tumors were excised, embedded in paraffin, and stained for the von Willebrand factor (vWF) endothelial cell marker (RB-281-A; Neo Marker) In brief, tissue sections were deparaffinized, treated with proteinase K, blocked with bovine serum albumin, and incubated with the vWF primary antibody and subsequently with a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. A peroxidase kit (SK-4100) from Vector Laboratories was used for detection. Tissue sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. RNA Isolation and Real-time PCR—For RNA isolation, cells were lysed directly on the culture plate using lysis buffer provided in the RNeasy kit with DNase I digestion (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The relative abundance of target gene mRNA, as well as the internal control 18 S rRNA, was measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed on an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primers and probe for VEGF (all isoforms) were: upper primer, 5′-TAC-CTC-CAC-CAT-GCC-AAG-TG-3′, lower primer, 5′-GAT-GAT-TCT-GCC-CTC-CTC-CTT-3′, and probe, 5′-6FAM-TCC-CAG-GCT-GCA-CCC-ATG-GC-TAMRA-3′. Primers and probe for SDF-1α were: upper primer, 5′-TCT-CAA-AAT-TCT-CAA-CAC-TCC-AAA-CT-3′, lower primer, 5′-GCA-CAC-TTG-TCT-GTT-GTT-GTT-CTT-3′ and probe, 5′-6FAM-TGC-CCT-TCA-GAT-TGT-AGC-CCG-GC-TA-MRA-3′. Primers and probe for ribosomal 18 S and histone 1a (H1a) genes were from the Applied Biosystems kit (4308329) and from the University of California at San Francisco core facility, respectively. Expression levels were calculated against a standard curve using serial dilutions of total RNA. Analyses were performed in quadruplicate for each sample. Values presented are the ratio of target mRNA to 18 S RNA. Statistical analyses were performed using a non-paired Student t test or one-way analysis of variance and considered significant when p was <0.05. Conditioned Medium from Senescent Fibroblasts Stimulates HUVEC Invasiveness—We reported that senescent WI-38 fibroblasts promote the tumorigenic progression of preneoplastic epithelial cells when co-injected into immunocompromised mice (10Krtolica A. Parrinello S. Lockett S. Desprez P.Y. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12072-12077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). The resulting tumors were large and vascularized, suggesting that angiogenesis had occurred during tumor progression. Angiogenesis is essential for the survival of tumors located >100–200 μm from blood vessels and generally occurs because tumor and/or surrounding stromal cells secrete factors that stimulate the proliferation, migration, and invasion of surrounding endothelial cells (25Tonini T. Rossi F. Claudio P.P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6549-6556Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether senescent WI-38 fibroblasts secrete factors that stimulate endothelial cell migration and invasion. We collected conditioned media from presenescent and replicatively senescent fibroblasts and used them as attractants in a cell culture assay for the migration and invasion of HUVECs through basement membrane components, commercially supplied as Matrigel. Conditioned medium from senescent fibroblasts was 3-fold more potent than medium from presenescent fibroblasts in stimulating HUVEC migration and invasion (Fig. 1). One of the most potent angiogenic factors identified to date is VEGF (26Leung D.W. Cachianes G. Kuang W.J. Goeddel D.V. Ferrara N. Science. 1989; 246: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (4396) Google Scholar). To determine whether VEGF was responsible for the senescence-associated stimulation of HUVEC migration and invasion, we pretreated the conditioned medium with a VEGF-blocking antibody. Pretreatment of presenescent conditioned medium reduced HUVEC invasiveness to the level seen when no attractant was provided (background invasiveness) (Fig. 1A). Thus, essentially all the invasion stimulated by presenescent conditioned medium was due to VEGF. Likewise, VEGF-blocking antibody substantially reduced the ability of senescent conditioned medium to stimulate HUVEC invasiveness, reducing it to about the level stimulated by presenescent conditioned medium (Fig. 1A). Nonetheless, the antibody failed to inhibit a significant fraction (∼45%) of the invasion stimulated by senescent conditioned medium (Fig. 1A). Still, the VEGFdependent blocked fraction (72 cells/field) triggered by senescent conditioned medium was significantly higher (p < 0.02) compared with the VEGF-dependent fraction stimulated by presenescent conditioned medium (45 cells/field). The blocking antibody was very effective (>90%) at blocking the ability of recombinant VEGF to stimulate HUVEC invasiveness (Fig. 1B). For this experiment, recombinant VEGF was use at 15 ng/ml, a concentration exceeding that present in senescent conditioned medium by >7-fold (see Fig. 2). These findings suggest that senescent fibroblasts secrete more VEGF than presenescent fibroblasts but also secrete factors in addition to VEGF that promote HUVEC invasion. VEGF is Up-regulated in Senescent Fibroblasts—To directly determine whether senescent fibroblasts up-regulate VEGF expression, we used real-time quantitative PCR and an ELISA assay to measure VEGF mRNA and secreted protein, respectively. Compared with presenescent fibroblasts, senescent WI-38 fibroblasts expressed 2- to 3-fold more VEGF mRNA (Fig. 2A). Notably, this 2-fold increase in mRNA resulted in a 6-fold increase in secreted VEGF protein (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, senescent WI-38 fibroblasts expressed no more SDF-1 mRNA or protein than their presenescent counterparts (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, although senescent fibroblasts have biological properties that overlap with those of tumor-associated fibroblasts (15Olumi A.F. Grossfeld G.D. Hayward S.W. Carroll P.R. Tlsty T.D. Cunha G.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5002-5011PubMed Google Scholar, 16Orimo A. Gupta P.B. Sgroi D.C. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Delaunay T. Naeem R. Carey V.J. Richardson A.L. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2005; 121: 335-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2801) Google Scholar), in at least some cases senescent and tumor-associated fibroblasts may achieve similar biological effects by different molecular mechanisms. Analysis of other fibroblast cell strains confirmed that increased VEGF expression was not restricted to WI-38. Indeed, we found 4- to 5-fold more VEGF expression in senescent compared with presenescent human fetal lung IMR90 and human adult breast fibroblasts (Fig. 3, hBF). Surprisingly, no increase in VEGF expression was observed in human neonatal foreskin HCA2 and BJ fibroblasts (Fig. 3). The reason why VEGF up-regulation is not a hallmark of all senescent fibroblast cell lines remains to be determined; cell strain-specific differences in p16 regulation may play a role (see “Discussion”). Senescent Fibroblasts Increase Vascularization of Tumor in Mice—To determine the physiological relevance of the senescent-associated increase in VEGF expression we injected weakly tumorigenic EpH4-v mouse epithelial cells alone or together with presenescent or senescent mouse breast fibroblasts (mBF). Two months later, the EpH4-v tumors were excised and immunostained for the vWF endothelial-specific marker. The results revealed very significant augmentation in vascularization when senescent mBF were co-injected with EpH4-v (Fig. 4, A–C). Both the number and size of vWF-positive vessels were increased by the co-injection of senescent mBF (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, the most striking difference was the presence of numerous large vessels (>0.1 mm) in the mBF senescent group. Large vessels were virtually absent from control tumors resulting from EpH4-v cells injected alone or together with presenescent mBF. Of particular interest, increased vascularization was observed despite mBF having only a 2-fold change in VEGF secretion at senescence (Fig. 4E). As expected, tumors excised from animals injected with Eph4-v cells alone or together with presenescent fibroblasts were on average significantly smaller (74 and 105 mm3, respectively) compared with tumors injected with senescent fibroblasts (174 mm3). Taken together, these results suggest that one mechanism by which senescent stromal cells facilitate tumor progression is by enhancing blood vessel formation. Increased VEGF Expression Is Senescence Specific—Is the enhanced VEGF expression due to the senescent phenotype per se or, alternatively, to the growth-arrested state of senescent fibroblasts? To answer this question, we cultured presenescent fibroblasts in serum-deficient medium for 3 days, which caused them to arrest growth in a reversible quiescent state (data not shown). In contrast to senescence, quiescence failed to increase VEGF mRNA or protein levels (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that enhanced VEGF production is not a consequence of the growth state of senescent cells but rather is a feature of the senescent phenotype. To more critically test the idea that enhanced VEGF expression is a consequence of senescence, we induced presenescent WI-38 cells to undergo rapid senescence by ectopically expressing p16INK4a or oncogenic RAS (Ha-RASv12), two known inducers of a rapid senescence response (23Beausejour C.M.

We expressed p16INK4a, oncogenic RAS, or a control protein (green fluorescent protein, GFP) using lentiviral vectors, which allowed rapid ectopic expression in >99% of the population (see “Materials and Methods”). p16INK4a expression reduced cell proliferation within 4 days, whereas oncogenic RAS slightly stimulated proliferation before arresting growth, as expected (23Beausejour C.M.

In either case, within 7 days after lentiviral transduction, cells ceased proliferation (Fig. 5B) and developed a senescent phenotype as determined by their large flat morphology and expression of the senescence-associated β-galactosidase (not shown) as described (2Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O.M. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5558) Google Scholar). By contrast, cells infected with the control GFP-expressing lentivirus continued to proliferate (Fig. 5B). Quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA assays showed that VEGF mRNA and secreted protein levels increased in response to p16INK4a and oncogenic RAS, but not GFP (Fig. 5, C and D), to approximately the same levels induced by replicative senescence. Thus, WI-38 fibroblasts responded to replicative exhaustion, p16INK4a expression, and expression of oncogenic RAS, all of which induce senescence, by up-regulating VEGF expression. Senescent Fibroblasts Retain VEGF Inducibility by Hypoxia—The best-studied inducer of VEGF expression is hypoxia, which increases VEGF transcription by stabilizing and activating the hypoxic-inducible (transcription) factor 1 α (HIF-1α) (18Mukhopadhyay D. Datta K. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2004; 14: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 29Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4100) Google Scholar). To determine whether the senescence-induced increase in VEGF production is caused by the same mechanism used by hypoxia, we determined the levels of HIF-1α in presenescent and senescent WI-38 fibroblasts. Senescent cells expressed only slightly more (<2-fold) HIF-1α than presenescent cells, a level far less than that induced by hypoxia (Fig. 6A). This was true whether cells were made senescent by replicative exhaustion or overexpression of p16INK4a (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, although hypoxia caused a striking accumulation of HIF-1α in presenescent cells, as expected, hypoxia failed to increase HIF-1α levels in senescent cells (Fig. 6A). These findings suggest that the classic mechanisms responsible for the hypoxic response may be impaired in senescent cells. Despite impaired hypoxia-induced HIF-1α expression, senescent cells up-regulated VEGF mRNA and protein secretion in response to hypoxia (Fig. 6B). Of note, the amount of VEGF secreted by senescent cells solely in response to hypoxia (∼1000 pg) exceeded that secreted by presenescent cells solely in response to hypoxia (∼400 pg) (compare Fig. 2 with Fig. 6). These results suggest that senescence may synergize with hypoxia to stimulate VEGF production. Senescence, like apoptosis, most likely evolved to prevent cancer by arresting the growth of cells in danger of becoming neoplastic. However, senescent cells may also contribute to aging and age-related disease, including late life cancer, consistent with the senescence response being an example of antagonistic pleiotropy (6Campisi J. Cell. 2005; 120: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). The deleterious effects of senescent cells are thought to derive from the myriad factors they secrete. These factors include matrix-degrading proteases, growth factors, and inflammatory cytokines (6Campisi J. Cell. 2005; 120: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar, 7Roninson I.B. Cancer Lett. 2002; 179: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 30Dimri G.P. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 505-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), all of which can disrupt normal tissue homeostasis and favor cancer development. Here, we have shown that most, but not all, human and mouse fibroblast strains secrete biologically active VEGF at senescence. VEGF is a potent angiogenic factor known to be important for cancer progression (31Neri D. Bicknell R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 436-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). We previously showed that senescent WI-38 fibroblasts promote the conversion of preneoplastic epithelial cells to malignant tumors when co-injected into immunocompromised mice (10Krtolica A. Parrinello S. Lockett S. Desprez P.Y. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12072-12077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that tumors that develop in the presence of senescent fibroblasts are substantially more vascularized than tumors that develop in the presence of presenescent fibroblasts or in the absence of fibroblasts. Strikingly, senescent cells not only augmented the number of blood vessels/mm2 but increased their size as well. In fact, we routinely found large vessels (defined as >0.1 mm) only in tumors that developed in the presence of senescent fibroblasts. These results suggest that the presence of senescent fibroblasts may have favored tumor vascularization early on. Invasion of HUVEC cells is a prerequisite for angiogenesis. Accordingly, we found that some senescent cells, by secreting VEGF and other important factors, stimulated HUVEC to migrate and invade a basement membrane in culture. Indeed, invasion of HUVEC in the presence of a VEGF-blocking antibody suggested that senescent fibroblasts likely secrete additional angiogenic factors. Surprisingly, SDF-1, an angiogenic factor produced by tumor-associated fibroblasts (16Orimo A. Gupta P.B. Sgroi D.C. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Delaunay T. Naeem R. Carey V.J. Richardson A.L. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2005; 121: 335-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2801) Google Scholar), was not among the factors secreted by senescent WI-38 cells. Thus, although senescent and tumor-associated fibroblasts have overlapping biological effects on neighboring preneoplastic or neoplastic epithelial cells (10Krtolica A. Parrinello S. Lockett S. Desprez P.Y. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12072-12077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar, 15Olumi A.F. Grossfeld G.D. Hayward S.W. Carroll P.R. Tlsty T.D. Cunha G.R.

Cell. 2005; 121: 335-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2801) Google Scholar), they may use distinct mechanisms to achieve at least some of their biological effects. Quiescent WI-38 cells did not up-regulate VEGF, suggesting that elevated VEGF secretion is a senescence-associated, rather than simply growth state-associated, phenotype. Quiescence is a reversible arrested state that results in part from increased expression of p21CIP1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and p53 transcriptional target (32Itahana K. Dimri G. Campisi J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2784-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 33Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5072) Google Scholar). p53 and p21CIP1 are also important for the essentially irreversible arrest of senescent cells (32Itahana K. Dimri G. Campisi J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2784-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 34Collins C.J. Sedivy J.M. Aging Cell. 2003; 2: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In some senescent cells, including WI-38 fibroblasts, the irreversibility of the arrest is due in large measure to increased expression of a different cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p16INK4a (23Beausejour C.M. Krtolica A. Galimi F. Narita M. Lowe S.W. Yaswen P. Campisi J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar, 35Itahana K. Zou Y. Itahana Y. Martinez J.L. Beausejour C. Jacobs J.J. Van Lohuizen M. Band V. Campisi J. Dimri G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Not all human fibroblast strains senesce with elevated p16INK4a levels. For example, human BJ and HCA2 foreskin fibroblasts senesce with high levels of p21CIP but undetectable levels of p16INK4a, and senescence in these cells, but not WI-38, is reversible upon inactivation of p53 (23Beausejour C.M. Krtolica A. Galimi F. Narita M. Lowe S.W. Yaswen P. Campisi J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). It is interesting, then, that VEGF levels were not elevated in senescent BJ and HCA2 cells (Fig. 3). This finding suggests that VEGF up-regulation is not common to all senescent fibroblasts and might depend on whether the p16INK4a/pRB pathway is engaged at senescence. Consistent with this idea, early passage WI-38 increased VEGF secretion following ectopic overexpression of p16INK4a or oncogenic RAS, which requires p16INK4a for its ability to induce senescence (36Drayton S. Rowe J. Jones R. Vatcheva R. Cuthbert-Heavens D. Marshall J. Fried M. Peters G. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 301-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We also found that the senescence-associated increase in VEGF production was not accompanied by a commensurate increase in HIF-1α, the major transcription factor that up-regulates VEGF in response to hypoxia (25Tonini T. Rossi F. Claudio P.P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6549-6556Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that VEGF up-regulation by senescent cells is not due to classic hypoxic response mechanisms. Moreover, under hypoxic conditions, we found that senescent cells failed to induce HIF-1α, in contrast to presenescent cells, which induced HIF-1α to high levels. Nonetheless, senescent cells up-regulated VEGF in response to hypoxia, and this response synergized with the senescent-associated increase in VEGF secretion. At present, we do not know whether the slightly increased basal levels of HIF-1α in normoxia is responsible for the senescence-associated increase in VEGF or whether other mechanisms, such as diminished expression of Von Hippel-Lindau, or direct activation of HIF-1α by pRB (37Budde A. Schneiderhan-Marra N. Petersen G. Brune B. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1802-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 38Giaccia A.J. Simon M.C. Johnson R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2183-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), are responsible. Whatever the mechanism by which senescent cells up-regulate VEGF, our findings provide an additional and potentially important mechanism by which senescent human stromal cells might stimulate cancer progression, namely, up-regulation of angiogenic factors such as VEGF.

TLR2 seems to be the most promiscuous TLR receptor able to recognize the most diverse set of pathogenassociated patterns. Its promiscuity has been attributed to its unique ability to heterodimerize with TLRs 1 and 6 and, most recently, to its association with CD36 in response to diacylated lipoproteins. Thus, it seems that TLR2 forms receptor clusters in response to different microbial ligands. In this study we investigated TLR2 cell surface heterotypic interactions in response to different ligands as well as internalization and intracellular trafficking. Our data show that TLR2 forms heterodimers with TLR1 and TLR6 and that these heterodimer pre-exist and are not induced by the ligand. Upon stimulation by the specific ligand, these heterodimers are recruited within lipid rafts. In contrast, heterotypic associations of TLR2/6 with CD36 are not preformed and are ligand-induced. All TLR2 receptor clusters accumulate in lipid rafts and are targeted to the Golgi apparatus. This localization and targeting is ligand-specific. Activation occurs at the cell surface, and the observed trafficking is independent of signaling.

To date most of the TLRs have been shown to be able to recognize a particular molecular structure associated with a pathogen; TLR4 recognizes lipopolysaccharide from Gram-negative bacteria (3Poltorak A.

The question that arises is how TLR2 is able to recognize such diverse microbial structures? Its promiscuity has been attributed to its unique ability to heterodimerize with TLRs 1 and 6 (18Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Schroeder L. Aderem A.

Studies using diacylated and triacylated lipoproteins have revealed that diacylated lipoproteins require TLR2/6 heterodimers for activation, whereas triacylated lipoproteins induce activation of the innate immune system independently of TLR6 and mainly through TLR2/TLR1 heterodimers (13Takeuchi O.

Zahringer U. Beutler B. Nature. 2005; 433: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) has shed more light into TLR2 heterotypic associations by demonstrating using forward-genetic mutagenesis that TLR2/TLR6 heterodimers also require CD36 to sense diacylated lipoproteins, whereas TLR2/TLR1 heterodimers do not. Although the work of Hoebe et al. (23Hoebe K. Georgel P. Rutschmann S. Du X. Mudd S. Crozat K. Sovath S. Shamel L. Hartung T. Zahringer U. Beutler B. Nature. 2005; 433: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) has given us a clearer picture of receptor associations in response to different TLR2 microbial stimuli, questions still remain. Does TLR2 form different heterotypic associations in response to different stimuli? Is the mechanism of innate recognition via TLR2 similar to TLR4, which seems to form activation clusters in response to different stimuli composed of different receptors depending on the microbial ligand (24Triantafilou M. Brandenburg K. Kusumoto S. Fukase K. Mackie A. Seydel U. Triantafilou K. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 25Triantafilou M. Triantafilou K. J. Endotoxin Res. 2003; 9: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)? Most importantly, do these heterotypic associations pre-exist, or are they induced by the ligand? Finally do the different TLR2 microbial ligands trigger signaling in a similar manner, from the surface or intracellularly? In this study we have chosen to investigate the cell surface heterotypic interactions as well as the intracellular trafficking of TLR2 and associated molecules in response to different microbial ligands. Using fluorescent imaging techniques, we investigated the localization of TLR2, TLR1, TLR6, and CD36 at the cell surface as well as defined the subcellular localization and trafficking of these receptors. Here we show that different TLR2 microbial ligands induce the formation of different receptor clusters on the cell surface within lipid rafts. We demonstrate for the first time the direct association of TLR2/TLR6 and CD36 in response to bacterial LTA as well as diacylated lipoproteins, whereas TLR2/TLR1 heterodimers were formed in response to triacylated lipoproteins in the absence of CD36. The heterodimers formed between TLR2/TLR6 or TLR2/TLR1 seem to pre-exist and to internalize along with the corresponding ligand and rapidly targeted the Golgi apparatus independently of the clathrin-interacting endocytic machinery. In contrast, receptor clusters involving CD36 are not preformed but are formed within lipid rafts upon ligand binding and also targeted to the Golgi apparatus. Signaling is triggered at the cell surface, and thus, CD36 must act as a facilitator associating and presenting the ligand to the TLR heterodimer on the cell surface, and subsequently, the whole complex must be internalized and targeted to the Golgi apparatus. Thus, it seems that TLR2 utilizes the same molecular mechanisms as TLR4. Similar to TLR4, TLR2 forms activation clusters composed of several receptors depending on the ligand; these clusters trigger signaling from the cell surface and subsequently are targeted to the Golgi in a lipid-raft dependent pathway. Materials—LTA from Staphylococcus aureus was prepared as previously described (26Morath S. Geyer A. Spreitzer I. Hermann C. Hartung T. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 938-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The N-terminal part of the lipoprotein LP44 of Mycoplasma salivarium (FSL-1) and N-palmitoyl-S-dipalmitoylglyceryl (Pam3) Cys-Scr-(Lys)4 (CSK4) were obtained from EMC Microcollections GmbH (Tubingen, Germany). EEA1-specific polyclonal serum was obtained from Santa Cruz. LTA-specific antibody was purchased from Cambridge Biosciences (Cambridge, UK). Hybridoma cells secreting 26ic (anti-CD14) and W6/32 secreting major histocompatibility complex class I-specific mAb were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). TLR2-specific antibody, TL2.1, as well as TLR1-specific antibody were purchased from HyCult (Denmark). TLR6-specific antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz. GM130, Golgispecific antibody, was purchased from BD Biosciences. The antibodies were conjugated to either Cy3 or Cy5 using Cy3 and Cy5 labeling kits from Amersham Biosciences. Cholera toxin was purchased from List Labs. Stable Cell Lines—Stable transfections of HEK293 cells with pcDNA3, GFP-TLR2, or CD14 were performed using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations as previously described (27Triantafilou M.

Positive selection by fluorescence-activated cell sorting was performed. Clonal cell lines were obtained by limiting dilution. Transfected cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.5 units/ml penicillin, 0.5 μg/ml streptomycin, 400 μg/ml G418 for HEK/pcDNA3, HEK/GFP-TLR2, HEK/CD14, HEK/GFP-TLR2/CD14, and 400 μg/ml hygromycin for HEK/GFP-TLR2/CD14. Stably transfected cells were transiently transfected with puno-TLR1, TLR6, and/or CD36 plasmids (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Isolation of Human Monocytes—Monocytes were isolated from human A+ buffy coats. Adherent cell monolayers (1 × 105 to 2 × 105 monocytes/well) were cultured in 24-well plates in serum free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.01% l-glutamine and 40 μg of gentamicin/ml. Cytokine Assays—Stably transfected HEK cells or human monocytes were plated on 24-well dishes (Nunc, Germany) at a concentration of 1 × 106/ml in 300 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum. The next day cells were stimulated for the indicated time period. The supernatants were collected and frozen until the cytokine assays were performed. The BD Biosciences bead array system was used to determine the level of TNF-α. Cell Labeling for Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)—Human monocytes were labeled with 100 μl of a 1:1 mixture of donor-conjugated antibody (Cy3) and acceptorconjugated antibody (Cy5). For control experiments, to determine whether FRET is dependent on donor and acceptor surface density, the donor:acceptor ratio was varied to 1:2 and 1:4. The cells were rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.02% bovine serum albumin before fixation with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min. The cells were fixed to prevent potential re-organization of the proteins during the course of the experiment. FRET Measurements—FRET is a non-invasive imaging technique used to determine molecular proximity. FRET can occur more than 1-10-nm distances and effectively increases the resolution of light microscopy to the molecular level. It involves non-radiative transfer of energy from the excited state of a donor molecule to an appropriate acceptor. The rate of energy transfer is inversely proportional to the sixth power of the distance, between donor and acceptor. The efficiency of energy transfer (E) is defined with respect to r and R0, the characteristic Forster distance by E = 1/(1 + (r/R0)6). In the present study, FRET was measured using a method as previously described (28Kenworthy A.K. Edidin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 29Kenworthy A.K.

Fluorescent Imaging—HEK/GFP-TLR2/CD14 transiently transfected cells with TLR1, TLR6, and/or CD36 were grown on microchamber culture slides (Labtek slides, Nunc). Cells were stimulated with either 10 μg/ml LTA, Pam3CSK4, or FSL-1 for 30 min. After stimulation they were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min and labeled with fluorescent antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% saponin. Then they were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The slides were mounted on Prolong antifadant (Molecular probes). Cells were imaged on a Carl Zeiss, Inc. LSM510 META confocal microscope (with an Axiovert 200 fluorescent microscope) using a 1.4 NA 63× Zeiss objective. The images were analyzed using LSM 2.5 image analysis software (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). The different fluorophores were detected using the appropriate filter sets. Luciferase Reporter Assays for NF-κB Activation—HEK293 cells transfected with CD14, GFP-TLR2, TLR6/1, and CD36 were seeded into 96-well plates. The following day the cells were transiently transfected with an NF-κB luciferase reporter gene using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The next day the cells were stimulated as indicated, and after 6 h of stimulation, the cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using a plate reader luminometer. TNF-α Secretion in Response to Different TLR2 Ligands—Before investigating whether different TLR2 ligands induce the formation of different receptor clusters, we investigated cytokine production in response to the different ligands that we were going to utilize in this study. Human monocytes were stimulated with LTA, PAM3CSK4 (triacyl-lipopeptide), and FSL-1 (bisacyl-lipopeptide) as well as LPS as a control. We measured TNF-α production in response to the different TLR2 ligands (Fig. 1). We found that all TLR2 ligands (LTA, PAM3CSK4, FSL-1) triggered similar levels of TNF-α secretion. In addition to human monocytes, in this study we transfected HEK293 cells with CD14/GFP-TLR2 cells with CD36 and either TLR1 or TLR6 to be able to define the subcellular localization and trafficking of TLR2 receptor complexes before and after stimulation by different TLR2 ligands. HEK293 cells are normally unresponsive to microbial ligands since they lack CD14 and TLR expression. To establish that transfection of HEK293 cells with CD14 and TLR2/1 or TLR2/6 rendered them able to respond to the different ligands, we measured TNF-α secretion in HEK293, HEK/CD14, HEK/CD36 HEK/TLR2/1, HEK/TLR2/6, HEK/CD14/CD36//GFP-TLR2/1, HEK/CD14/CD36/GFP-TLR2/6 cells after stimulation by LTA, PAM3CSK4, or FSL-1. In parallel, as a control HEK293, HEK/CD14, HEK/CD36 HEK/TLR2/1, HEK/TLR2/6, HEK/CD14/CD36//GFP-TLR2/1, HEK/CD14/CD36/GFP-TLR2/6, and human monocytes were stimulated with 10 μg/ml LTA and 100 ng/ml LPS. After stimulation, supernatants were collected and analyzed for TNF-α using a flow cytometric bead array system. As expected it was shown that HEK293 cells were incapable of responding to any of the microbial ligands. Transfection with CD14, TLR2/1, or TLR2/6 alone did not make them responsive to bacterial products, whereas transfection with CD14 and TLR2/1 rendered them responsive to Pam3CSK4 but not to LPS (Fig. 1, striped bars). In contrast, transfection with TLR2/6 rendered them responsive to LTA and FSL-1 but not to LPS (Fig. 1, black and checked bars). From these data we conclude that transfection of HEK293 cells with both CD14 and TLR2/1 renders them responsive to triacylated lipopeptides, whereas transfection with CD14, CD36, and TLR2/6 enables them to respond to diacylated lipopeptides. Heterotypic Interactions of TLR2—It has previously been demonstrated using biochemical techniques as well as knockout mice that TLR2 forms heterodimers with either TLR1 or TLR6 in response to different ligands (13Takeuchi O. Sato S. Horiuchi T. Hoshino K. Takeda K. Dong Z. Modlin R.L. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar, 21Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Muhlradt P.F. Morr M. Randolf J.D. Zychlinsky A. Takeda K. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar) as well as CD36 (23Hoebe K. Georgel P. Rutschmann S. Du X. Mudd S. Crozat K. Sovath S. Shamel L. Hartung T. Zahringer U. Beutler B. Nature. 2005; 433: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). One of the questions that remains is whether these associations are preformed or whether they are ligand-induced. In this study we set out to investigate TLR2 heterotypic associations before and after stimulation by LTA, PAM3CSK4, or FSL-1 by utilizing FRET. We measured FRET in terms of dequenching of donor fluorescence after complete photobleaching of the acceptor fluorophore. Increased donor fluorescence after complete destruction of the acceptor indicated that the donor fluorescence was quenched in the presence of the acceptor because of energy transfer. We tested the energy transfer efficiency in our system using as a positive control the energy transfer from mAbs Cy3-W6/32 and Cy5-MCA1115 to two different epitopes on major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, which showed that the maximum energy transfer efficiency (E) was 35 ± 1.0. To determine TLR2 heterotypic interactions before and after stimulation by bacterial products, we proceeded to measure FRET on human monocytes before stimulation between TLR2 (using Cy3-specific TLR2 mAb) and TLR1, TLR6, or CD36 (Cy5-specific mAbs). TLR2 was found to associate to some extent with TLR1 and TLR6 before stimulation, thus suggesting that TLR2/1 and TLR2/6 heterodimers pre-exist (Fig. 2, white bars). In contrast, TLR2 was found not to associate with CD36 before stimulation by bacterial products (Fig. 2); thus, TLR2 associations with CD36 are ligand-induced. To determine whether TLR2 associated with these molecules after stimulation, human monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors and stimulated for 10 min at 37 °C with either 10 μg/ml LTA, 10 nm FSL-1, or 10 nm Pam3CSK4 before fixation and labeling with the fluorescent probes. Energy transfer between TLR2-Cy3 and Cy5-labeled antibodies against CD14, TLR1, TLR6, or CD36 was measured. As expected upon LTA stimulation, TLR2 associated with CD14, TLR6, and CD36 since large dequenching was observed after Cy5-CD14, Cy5-TLR6, and Cy5-CD36 photobleaching (Fig. 2), suggesting that upon stimulation there is further clustering of these molecules. Similar findings were found upon stimulation with the diacylated lipopeptide FSL-1. We observed large dequenching (E = 32 ± 1.0%) between TLR2 and TLR6 and between TLR2 and CD14 (E = 34 ± 2.0%) as well as TLR2 and CD36 (E = 30 ± 1.0%). In contrast, when cells were stimulated with Pam3CSK4, it was shown that TLR2 clustered with TLR1 but not with CD36 (Fig. 2). To rule out the possibility that the FRET observed was due to random distribution, we varied the ratio of donors and acceptors used to label the proteins of interest (data not shown). E was found to be independent on acceptor density, to be sensitive to the donor:acceptor ratio, and not to go to zero at low surface density, thus suggesting that the FRET values observed were due to clustered molecules and not random associations. TLR1, TLR6, and CD36 Associate with Lipid Rafts—Because TLR2 has been previously shown to reside within lipid rafts upon stimulation by LTA (27Triantafilou M. Manukyan M. Mackie A. Morath S. Hartung T. Heine H. Triantafilou K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40882-40889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 30Triantafilou M. Morath S. Mackie A. Hartung T. Triantafilou K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4007-4014Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), we proceeded to investigate whether these TLR2-receptor clusters were formed in lipid rafts. We measured FRET on monocytes between the different receptor molecules and GM1 ganglioside, a raftassociated lipid (using Cy5-cholera toxin). Initially we investigated whether TLR6 and CD36 were present within lipid rafts before stimulation. It was found that CD36 was present in lipid rafts before stimulation, but TLR6 was not, since there was no energy transfer (Fig. 3). In contrast, upon stimulation with either LTA or FSL-1, large dequenching was observed once the Cy5 was photobleached, with E = 26 ± 0.5% and 30 ± 1.0%, respectively, suggesting that TLR6 concentrates in lipid rafts upon stimulation with bacterial products (Fig. 3). Control experiments were performed after Pam3CSK4 or LPS stimulation. The results showed that there was minimal energy transfer, thus suggesting that only stimulation with diacylated lipoproteins induces the association of TLR6 with lipid rafts and the subsequent clustering with CD14 and CD36, which are resident lipid-raft proteins. We similarly examined whether TLR1 receptor molecules localize in lipid rafts before Pam3CSK4 stimulation by using Cy3-TLR1-specific fluorescent probe and Cy5-cholera toxin for the GM1 ganglioside. Our results showed that there was no energy transfer observed between TLR1 and GM1 ganglioside (6 ± 1.0%); thus, TLR1 was not present in lipid rafts before stimulation by bacterial products (Fig. 3). In contrast, there was large dequenching between TLR1 and GM1 ganglioside after Pam3CSK4 stimulation (27 ± 1.5%), suggesting that similarly to TLR6, TLR1 does not reside in lipid rafts before stimulation but is recruited there after ligand binding (Fig. 3). Control experiments investigating the association of TLR1 with GM1 ganglioside after LTA, FSL-1, or LPS stimulation were also performed. It was shown that TLR1 was not recruited in lipid rafts after LTA, FSL-1, or LPS stimulation, since there was no energy transfer observed between TLR1 and GM1 ganglioside after stimulation by these ligands (Fig. 3). In addition, control experiments were performed investigating the recruitment of TLR4 in lipid rafts in response to different bacterial stimuli (LTA, FSL-1, Pam3CSK4, and LPS). It was shown that TLR4 associated with GM1 ganglioside only in response to LPS, thus demonstrating that recruitment to lipid rafts is specific to the microbial ligand. Internalization of TLR2 Receptor Clusters after LTA Stimulation—Because TLR2 seemed to form different receptor clusters in response to different stimuli, we proceeded to investigate whether the complexes formed followed similar targeting routes. We had previously investigated the internalization of TLR2 and CD14 in response to LTA and had found that they are both targeted to the Golgi apparatus (27Triantafilou M. Manukyan M. Mackie A. Morath S. Hartung T. Heine H. Triantafilou K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40882-40889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated whether the whole complex comprising CD14, TLR2, TLR6, and CD36 internalizes and is targeted to the same intracellular compartment. HEK/GFP-TLR2/CD14 cells transiently transfected with CD36, TLR1, and TLR6 were incubated for 30 min with 10 μg/ml LTA followed by fixation and labeling with antibodies against the Golgi apparatus as well as antibodies against TLR1, TLR6, or CD36 followed by the appropriate fluorescently labeled secondary antibody. Triple labeling confocal microscopy revealed that after LTA stimulation, TLR2/6 heterodimers along with CD36 are targeted to the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 4). TLR1 was found not to co-localize with the other receptor molecules and to be targeted to a distinct intracellular compartment (Fig. 4), suggesting that associations at the cell surface determine intracellular targeting. Similar findings were observed when we used human monocytes (supplemental Fig. 1). Internalization of TLR2 Receptor Clusters after FSL-1 Stimulation—To investigate whether the intracellular targeting that we observed in response to LTA was common for other ligands as well, we stimulated cells with FSL-1, another TLR2/6 ligand. Similarly to LTA, when we stimulated the cells with FSL-1, we found that TLR2/6 and CD36 were all targeted to the Golgi apparatus, whereas TLR1 was not (Fig. 5), suggesting that receptor clusters formed at the cell surface are internalized together and targeted to the same intracellular compartment. Similar findings were observed when human monocytes were used (data not shown). Internalization of TLR2 Receptor Clusters after Pam3CSK4 Stimulation—In contrast, when we investigated the internalization of these receptors in response to Pam3CSK4, TLR2 was still shown to be targeted to the Golgi apparatus, but TLR6 and CD36 were not (Fig. 6). As expected, TLR1 was targeted to the Golgi apparatus along with TLR2 in response to triacylated lipoproteins, thus suggesting that TLR2/1 heterodimers, once within lipid rafts and engaged by the appropriate ligand, internalize as a complex and are targeted to the Golgi. Control experiments were also performed after stimulation with LPS (supplemental Fig. 2). It was shown that in response to LPS, none of the receptor molecules (TLR1/2/6 or CD36) was targeted to the Golgi, suggesting that the internalization observed was specific to the corresponding ligand. Effects of Raft-disrupting Drugs on TLR2/TLR6/CD36 Entry—Because we had already found that TLR2/TLR6/CD36 reside in lipid rafts in response to microbial diacylglycerides, we investigated whether lipid raft-disrupting drugs such as nystatin (31Anderson H.A. Chen Y. Norkin L.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1825-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) or filipin (32Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) could inhibit TLR2/TLR6/CD36 targeting to the Golgi apparatus. Fluorescent labeling revealed that treatment with either filipin or nystatin prevented TLR6/CD36 colocalization to the Golgi (Fig. 7), leading us to believe that the internalization of the receptor complex is dependent on lipid raft integrity. Similarly, we investigated whether lipid-raft-disrupting drugs could inhibit TLR2/TLR1 targeting to the Golgi apparatus. It was shown that treatment with either filipin or nystatin prevented TLR2/TLR1 colocalization with the Golgi in response to triacylated lipoproteins (Pam3CSK4) (data not shown). Thus, it seems that membrane partitioning at the cell surface determines the subsequent internalization route that the complex is going to follow. The cells viability was not affected either by nystatin or filipin treatment because the drug-treated cells excluded trypan blue. TLR2/6 Trafficking in the Presence and Absence of CD36—To determine whether the trafficking and targeting of TLR2/6 heterodimers depended on CD36, we proceeded to investigate the trafficking of TLR2/6 in the absence of CD36. In the absence of CD36, in HEK-CD14/TLR2/6 cells there was rapid targeting to the Golgi apparatus. Using triple labeling, we were able to visualize co-localization of TLR2, TLR6, and the Golgi (Fig. 8), thus suggesting that the intracellular targeting to the Golgi is not CD36-dependent. To further examine the significance of the intracellular targeting, we disrupted the Golgi of HEK-CD14/TLR2/6 cells by adding brefeldin A (33Ward T.H. Polishchuk R.S. Caplan S. Hirschberg K. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In brefeldin A-pretreated cells, Golgi was disrupted, and TLR2 disappeared from the perinuclear area (Fig. 8B). However, despite its re-location, NF-κB activation in brefeldin A-treated cells was not diminished (Fig. 8C, black bars). Because internalization and trafficking occurred in the absence of CD36 and disruption of the TLR2-localization in the Golgi did not affect NF-κB activation, it is apparent that internalization and trafficking is neither sufficient nor necessary for TLR2-mediated activation irrespective of the ligand. Receptor Clustering on the Cell Surface Initiates Signaling—To verify that the signaling is initiated from the plasma membrane, we investigated the cell surface TLR6 distribution in response to LTA. HEK/CD14/GFPTLR2/6 cells were stimulated with 10 μg of LTA and imaged by confocal microscopy. It has shown that before stimulation, the distribution of TLR6 was diffuse on the cell surface (Fig. 9A). Upon LTA stimulation, TLR6 seems to form clusters. To investigate whether signaling was initiated via these clusters we analyzed the location of MyD88 before and after LTA stimulation. Before LTA stimulation, MyD88 was found to be expressed in diffused in the cytoplasm (Fig. 9A). Upon LTA stimulation, it was found that MyD88 was recruited close to the cell surface and co-localized with the TLR6 (Fig. 9B), thus suggesting that signaling is initiated via clustering of receptor molecules on the cell surface. Similar results were obtained with TLR2/1 heterodimers in response to Pam3CSK4 (data not shown). In this study we set out to characterize TLR2 heterotypic associations in response to different ligands, such as LTA and diacylated (FSL-1) as well as triacylated (Pam3CSK4) lipoproteins. Initially we investigated using transfected cells which receptors are required for innate immune responses against these ligands. It was shown that LTA-induced responses as well as responses against diacylated lipoproteins required the presence of CD14, CD36, TLR2, and TLR6. CD14 or CD36 alone could not trigger responses against microbial diacylglycerides, suggesting that cellular activation is a result of synergic interactions among these molecules. In contrast, innate immune responses against triacyl lipoproteins required the presence of CD14, TLR2, and TLR1 but not CD36. Because we had established which molecules were required for responses against different ligands, we proceeded to investigate whether there are molecular associations between these receptors in response to the different ligands. FRET experiments revealed that similarly to TLR4, TLR2 forms combinational associations with receptors depending on the microbial stimuli. The only difference was that TLR2 existed in heterodimers with either TLR1 or TLR6 before stimulation. These heterodimers formed bigger oligomers in response to their corresponding ligands as well as further heterotypic associations with other receptors (CD14 and/or CD36). When we investigated the distribution of these receptor clusters on the plasma membrane, another similarity with TLR4 was found, in that these clusters were formed within membrane microdomains or lipid rafts. CD14, which is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked protein, as well as CD36 were found to be constitutively localized in lipid rafts (34Wang P.Y. Kitchens R. Munford R.S. J. Inflamm. 1996; 47: 126-137Google Scholar, 35Triantafilou M. Miyake K. Golenbock D. Triantafilou K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2603-2611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas TLR2, TLR1, and TLR6 were found not to reside in lipid rafts before stimulation but to increasingly accumulate in the raft upon the presence of the corresponding microbial ligand. Thus, it seems that it is common for TLR molecules not to be present in lipid rafts but to be recruited there upon stimulation. Associations with lipid-raft-resident molecules, such as CD14 and CD36, seem to be another common feature of the TLR mechanism of activation. Lipid-raft resident molecules seem to associate with the ligand and to recruit TLR molecules to the specialized area of the plasma membrane. Lipid rafts do not only facilitate receptor interactions by compartmentalization of the plasma membrane but also seem to play a role in the internalization and intracellular targeting of the TLR activation clusters. In this study we utilized fluorescent imaging to track the entry route of the TLR2 receptor clusters within the cell. We utilized triple labeling fluorescent imaging to visualize TLR2, TLR1, and TLR6 CD36 as well as markers for intracellular compartments. We found that TLR2, TLR6, and CD36 were rapidly targeted to the Golgi apparatus within 30 min after LTA or diacylated lipoprotein stimulation. CD14 followed the same route, whereas TLR1 did not. In response to triacylated lipoproteins, TLR2/1 heterodimers were recruited in lipid rafts instead of TLR2/6 heterodimers, and this recruitment determined their intracellular targeting. TLR2/1 heterodimers were internalized and targeted to the Golgi apparatus in response to triacylated lipoproteins, suggesting that the location of the activation cluster at the plasma membrane determined its intracellular fate. These data are in good agreement with previous studies performed with bacterial LPS (36Thieblemont N. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 523-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 37Latz E. Visintin A. Lien E. Fitzgerald K. Monks B. Kurt-Jones E. Golenbock D.T. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47834-47843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) as well as LTA (27Triantafilou M. Manukyan M. Mackie A. Morath S. Hartung T. Heine H. Triantafilou K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40882-40889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, TLR2-receptor cluster internalization seemed to be lipid raft-dependent. In the presence of lipid raft disrupting drugs, such as nystatin or filipin, targeting of CD14/TLR2/6/CD36 or CD14/TLR2/1 receptor clusters to the Golgi network was inhibited upon disruption of the lipid raft integrity. Our studies suggest that lipid raft formation is crucial for TLR2 receptor internalization and targeting. Thus, it is emerging that this membrane partitioning might play a major role in protein uptake and intracellular routing. It is becoming more apparent that this differential sorting on the cell surface might predispose the intracellular fate of a given molecule. The selective recruitment of receptors within the raft determines the responses that are going to be triggered in response to a particular ligand, and subsequently this differential sorting at the cell surface determines the fate of the entire complex (Fig. 10). The entire receptor complex seems to internalize and to be targeted to the Golgi apparatus. The question that remains is whether this internalization and trafficking that we observe is crucial for TLR2-induced signaling. We had previously shown that LTA-induced TLR2 activation is independent of the internalization process (27Triantafilou M. Manukyan M. Mackie A. Morath S. Hartung T. Heine H. Triantafilou K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40882-40889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but a recent study by Stuart et al. (38Stuart L.M. Deng J. Silver J.M. Takahashi K. Tseng A.A. Hennessy E.J. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Moore K.J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) has suggested that responses against S. aureus require CD36-dependent phagocytosis. In this study we proceeded to investigate whether this was the case for other TLR2-ligands that employed CD36 as a co-receptor. To answer this question, we performed confocal experiments with HEK cells lacking CD36. These cells were shown to be able to internalize bacterial LTA and diacylated lipoproteins. In response to microbial diacylglycerides, TLR2 and TLR6 were internalized and rapidly targeted to the Golgi in the absence of CD36, thus suggesting that CD36 did not play a crucial role in the internalization and intracellular targeting of these receptor complexes. Brefeldin A disruption of the Golgi showed that TLR2/TLR6 localization in the Golgi was not essential for signaling and cytokine secretion. Similar to TLR4 (37Latz E. Visintin A. Lien E. Fitzgerald K. Monks B. Kurt-Jones E. Golenbock D.T. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47834-47843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), TLR2 was found to form clusters and to engage its ligand on the cell membrane where signaling was initiated. Thus our data are in agreement with Latz et al. (37Latz E. Visintin A. Lien E. Fitzgerald K. Monks B. Kurt-Jones E. Golenbock D.T. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47834-47843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), who have demonstrated that LPS internalization is independent of signal transduction but are in contrast to the recent report by Stuart et al. (38Stuart L.M. Deng J. Silver J.M. Takahashi K. Tseng A.A. Hennessy E.J. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Moore K.J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), who have showed that the internalization of S. aureus to the phagosome is dependent on CD36 and plays a crucial role for TLR2 signal transduction. The reason for these conflicting reports might be the fact that Stuart et al. (38Stuart L.M. Deng J. Silver J.M. Takahashi K. Tseng A.A. Hennessy E.J. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Moore K.J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) have used whole bacteria and not bacterial products, such as LTA or lipoproteins, in their study. It is possible that phagocytosis of whole bacteria, due to the difference in particle size, involves a completely different internalization mechanism when compared with bacterial products. Engagement of receptors and formation of clusters in response to whole bacteria could be completely different to those concerning bacterial products. Our study, which utilizes bacterial products, demonstrates a common mechanism of activation that seems to be involved in TLR activation. Our study suggests that TLR2 forms combinational clusters in response to different microbial stimuli. Similarly to TLR4, these clusters are formed within lipid rafts. Lipid rafts seem to provide a confined space that accommodates these receptor associations and their intracellular signaling machinery as well as a sorting mechanism that determines the internalization route that the receptor complex is going to follow. Selective recruitment of molecules within lipid rafts, depending on the ligand, determines innate immune responses as well as the intracellular fate of the receptor complex (Fig. 10). These findings highlight the fact that TLRs expressed on the cell surface utilize a common activation mechanism that involves the orchestration of multiple receptor molecules and plasma microdomains that lead to an extended repertoire of innate immune recognition.

https://openalex.org/W1750485943,"Formation of electron pairs is essential to superconductivity. For conventional superconductors, tunnelling spectroscopy has established that pairing is mediated by bosonic modes (phonons); a peak in the second derivative of tunnel current d2I/dV2 corresponds to each phonon mode. For high-transition-temperature (high-T(c)) superconductivity, however, no boson mediating electron pairing has been identified. One explanation could be that electron pair formation and related electron-boson interactions are heterogeneous at the atomic scale and therefore challenging to characterize. However, with the latest advances in d2I/dV2 spectroscopy using scanning tunnelling microscopy, it has become possible to study bosonic modes directly at the atomic scale. Here we report d2I/dV2 imaging studies of the high-T(c) superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta. We find intense disorder of electron-boson interaction energies at the nanometre scale, along with the expected modulations in d2I/dV2 (refs 9, 10). Changing the density of holes has minimal effects on both the average mode energies and the modulations, indicating that the bosonic modes are unrelated to electronic or magnetic structure. Instead, the modes appear to be local lattice vibrations, as substitution of 18O for 16O throughout the material reduces the average mode energy by approximately 6 per cent--the expected effect of this isotope substitution on lattice vibration frequencies. Significantly, the mode energies are always spatially anticorrelated with the superconducting pairing-gap energies, suggesting an interplay between these lattice vibration modes and the superconductivity."
https://openalex.org/W2027273404,"In mammals, glucose-regulated gene expression has been best characterized in the liver, where increased glucose metabolism induces transcription of genes encoding enzymes involved in de novo lipogenesis. ChREBP and Mlx dimerize and function together as a glucose-responsive transcription factor to regulate target genes, such as liver-type pyruvate kinase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, and fatty acid synthase. To identify additional glucose-responsive genes in the liver, we used microarray analysis to compare gene expression patterns in low and high glucose conditions in hepatocytes. Target genes of ChREBP·Mlx were simultaneously identified by gene profiling in the presence or absence of a dominant negative Mlx. Of 224 genes that are induced by glucose, 139 genes (62%) were also inhibited by the dominant negative Mlx. Lipogenic enzyme genes involved in the entire pathway of de novo lipogenesis were found to be glucose-responsive target genes of ChREBP·Mlx. Genes encoding enzymes in other metabolic pathways and numerous regulators of metabolism were also identified. To determine if any of these genes are direct targets of ChREBP·Mlx, we searched for ChoRE-like sequences in the 5′-flanking regions of several genes that responded rapidly to glucose. ChoRE sequences that bound to ChREBP·Mlx and supported a glucose response were identified in two additional genes. Combining all of the known ChoRE sequences, we generated a modified ChoRE consensus sequence, CAYGNGN5CNCRTG. In summary, ChREBP·Mlx is the principal transcription factor regulating glucose-responsive genes in the liver and coordinately regulates a family of genes required for glucose utilization and energy storage."

https://openalex.org/W2044799747,"ATP, released by both neurons and glia, is an important mediator of brain intercellular communication. We find that selective activation of purinergic P2Y1 receptors (P2Y1R) in cultured astrocytes triggers glutamate release. By total internal fluorescence reflection imaging of fluorescence-labeled glutamatergic vesicles, we document that such release occurs by regulated exocytosis. The stimulus-secretion coupling mechanism involves Ca2+ release from internal stores and is controlled by additional transductive events mediated by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and prostaglandins (PG). P2Y1R activation induces release of both TNFα and PGE2 and blocking either one significantly reduces glutamate release. Accordingly, astrocytes from TNFα-deficient (TNF–/–) or TNF type 1 receptor-deficient (TNFR1–/–) mice display altered P2Y1R-dependent Ca2+ signaling and deficient glutamate release. In mixed hippocampal cultures, the P2Y1R-evoked process occurs in astrocytes but not in neurons or microglia. P2Y1R stimulation induces Ca2+-dependent glutamate release also from acute hippocampal slices. The process in situ displays characteristics resembling those in cultured astrocytes and is distinctly different from synaptic glutamate release evoked by high K+ stimulation as follows: (a) it is sensitive to cyclooxygenase inhibitors; (b) it is deficient in preparations from TNF–/– and TNFR1–/– mice; and (c) it is inhibited by the exocytosis blocker bafilomycin A1 with a different time course. No glutamate release is evoked by P2Y1R-dependent stimulation of hippocampal synaptosomes. Taken together, our data identify the coupling of purinergic P2Y1R to glutamate exocytosis and its peculiar TNFα- and PG-dependent control, and we strongly suggest that this cascade operates selectively in astrocytes. The identified pathway may play physiological roles in glial-glial and glial-neuronal communication."

https://openalex.org/W1994790769,"The tumour suppressor protein merlin (encoded by the neurofibromatosis type 2 gene NF2) is an important regulator of proliferation in many cell and tissue types. Merlin is activated by dephosphorylation at serine 518 (S518), which occurs on serum withdrawal or on cell-cell or cell-matrix contact. However, the relevant phosphatase that activates merlin's tumour suppressor function is unknown. Here we identify this enzyme as the myosin phosphatase (MYPT-1-PP1delta). The cellular MYPT-1-PP1delta-specific inhibitor CPI-17 causes a loss of merlin function characterized by merlin phosphorylation, Ras activation and transformation. Constitutively active merlin (S518A) reverses CPI-17-induced transformation, showing that merlin is the decisive substrate of MYPT-1-PP1delta in tumour suppression. In addition we show that CPI-17 levels are raised in several human tumour cell lines and that the downregulation of CPI-17 induces merlin dephosphorylation, inhibits Ras activation and abolishes the transformed phenotype. MYPT-1-PP1delta and its substrate merlin are part of a previously undescribed tumour suppressor cascade that can be hindered in two ways, by mutation of the NF2 gene and by upregulation of the oncoprotein CPI-17."
https://openalex.org/W2026513203,"Pollinators may be seeking more than just food as a reward when they choose one flower over another. Brightly coloured flowers are attractive to pollinating insects, and the insects can expect a nutritional reward such as nectar when they visit. But insects may be looking for more than just food. They use large amounts of energy maintaining their body temperature above ambient, and some flowers offer warmth, using colour to advertise its presence. In a controlled experiment, bumblebees preferred to visit warmer flowers, and they learnt to use colour to predict floral temperature before landing. This may have implications for the evolution of floral structures. Floral colour signals are used by pollinators as predictors of nutritional rewards, such as nectar1,2,3. But as insect pollinators often need to invest energy to maintain their body temperature4 above the ambient temperature, floral heat might also be perceived as a reward. Here we show that bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) prefer to visit warmer flowers and that they can learn to use colour to predict floral temperature before landing. In what could be a widespread floral adaptation, plants may modulate their temperature to encourage pollinators to visit."
https://openalex.org/W2021177386,"More than 100 planets and brown dwarfs have been discovered in orbits around stars like our Sun. When these stars evolve to become red giants they will easily engulf their companions: what happens then? The discovery of the first known close sub-stellar (brown dwarf) companion to a white dwarf suggests that, surprisingly, some of these companions will survive the interaction relatively intact. Many sub-stellar companions orbit solar-type stars. These stars can engulf their companions when they become red giants. This paper reports the discovery of a brown dwarf in a short-period orbit around a white dwarf, where the engulfment of the brown dwarf had little effect on it. Many sub-stellar companions (usually planets but also some brown dwarfs) orbit solar-type stars. These stars can engulf their sub-stellar companions when they become red giants. This interaction may explain several outstanding problems in astrophysics1,2,3,4,5 but it is unclear under what conditions a low mass companion will evaporate, survive the interaction unchanged or gain mass1,4,5. Observational tests of models for this interaction have been hampered by a lack of positively identified remnants—that is, white dwarf stars with close, sub-stellar companions. The companion to the pre-white dwarf AA Doradus may be a brown dwarf, but the uncertain history of this star and the extreme luminosity difference between the components make it difficult to interpret the observations or to put strong constraints on the models6,7. The magnetic white dwarf SDSS J121209.31 + 013627.7 may have a close brown dwarf companion8 but little is known about this binary at present. Here we report the discovery of a brown dwarf in a short period orbit around a white dwarf. The properties of both stars in this binary can be directly observed and show that the brown dwarf was engulfed by a red giant but that this had little effect on it."
https://openalex.org/W2158635619,"Aminopeptidase N from Escherichia coli is a broad specificity zinc exopeptidase belonging to aminopeptidase clan MA, family M1. The structures of the ligand-free form and the enzyme-bestatin complex were determined at 1.5- and 1.6-Å resolution, respectively. The enzyme is composed of four domains: an N-terminal β-domain (Met1-Asp193), a catalytic domain (Phe194-Gly444), a middle β-domain (Thr445-Trp546), and a C-terminal α-domain (Ser547-Ala870). The structure of the catalytic domain exhibits similarity to thermolysin, and a metal-binding motif (HEXXHX18E) is found in the domain. The zinc ion is coordinated by His297, His301, Glu320, and a water molecule. The groove on the catalytic domain that contains the active site is covered by the C-terminal α-domain, and a large cavity is formed inside the protein. However, there exists a small hole at the center of the C-terminal α-domain. The N terminus of bestatin is recognized by Glu121 and Glu264, which are located in the N-terminal and catalytic domains, respectively. Glu298 and Tyr381, located near the zinc ion, are considered to be involved in peptide cleavage. A difference revealed between the ligand-free form and the enzyme-bestatin complex indicated that Met260 functions as a cushion to accept substrates with different N-terminal residue sizes, resulting in the broad substrate specificity of this enzyme.

Aminopeptidase N (EC 3.4.11.2) from Escherichia coli has an Mr of ∼99,000 and belongs to clan MA, family M1, and a zinc ion is found at its active center. It has been reported that this enzyme is the major aminopeptidase in E. coli, and it is involved in ATP-dependent downstream processing during cytosolic protein degradation (1Chandu D. Nandi D. Microbiology (Read.). 2003; 149: 3437-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This enzyme is well conserved in a variety of species such as mammals, insects, plants, and bacteria. Together with certain endopeptidases, aminopeptidase N plays a major role in peptide degradation, which enables the utilization of amino acids as nutrients. Additionally, aminopeptidase N is known to possess significant physiological functions as a receptor, irrespective of its enzymatic function. For example, human aminopeptidase N, which has been identified as a CD13 antigen, is known as a receptor for corona virus-like transmissible gastroenteritis virus and human corona virus 229E (2Delmas B.

Shapiro L.H. Look A.T. Holmes K.V. Nature. 1991; 357: 420-422Crossref Scopus (674) Google Scholar). In addition, isoforms from Bombyx mori have been reported to act as receptors for Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1A toxin (4Yaoi K. Nakanishi K. Kadotani T. Imamura M. Koizumi N. Iwahana H. Sato R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 5Nakanishi K. Yaoi K. Nagino Y. Hara H. Kitami M. Atsumi S. Miura N. Sato R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 519: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The human (gi 29840829) and B. mori (gi 3452557) enzymes, which are membrane-bound glycoproteins, unlike the E. coli counterpart, have sequence identities of 13.6 and 13.4% to the E. coli enzyme, respectively. Aminopeptidase N was first purified from E. coli K12 in 1982, and its catalytic properties were characterized using Ala-p-nitroanilide as a substrate by McCaman and Villarejo (6McCaman M.T. Villarejo M.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 384-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The enzyme was described as a monomeric acidic protein with an Mr of 87,000, and it was reported to have a sulfhydryl group essential for its activity because the activity of the enzyme was found to be inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate (pCMB). 4The abbreviations used are: pCMB, p-chloromercuribenzoate; βNA, β-naphthylamide; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; Wat, water. However, this activity was also later found to be inhibited by o-phenanthroline, puromycin, bestatin, and amastatin; in another study, Yoshimoto et al. (7Yoshimoto T. Tamase Y. Gushi K. Murayama N. Tsuru D. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1988; 52: 217-225Google Scholar) demonstrated that aminopeptidase N possesses an essential metal ion and a sulfhydryl group involved in the catalytic activity of this enzyme. The nucleotide sequence of the pepN gene encoding aminopeptidase N was determined by Foglino and co-workers (8Foglino M. Gharbi S. Lazdunski A. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 49: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This gene codes for a protein of 870 amino acid residues. Although aminopeptidase N has been recognized since the 1980s, the three-dimensional structure of this enzyme had not yet been determined. Many aminopeptidases have been classified in the same family to date, including aminopeptidase A (EC 3.4.11.7), aminopeptidase B (EC 3.4.11.6), and oxytocinase (EC 3.4.11.3), and important biological functions have been attributed to these enzymes. However, structural information about this family of enzymes remains limited; in fact, such information is currently available for only two such enzymes: leukotriene A4 hydrolase (EC 3.3.2.6) from humans (9Thunnissen M.M. Nordlund P. Haeggdtrom J.Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and tricorn-interacting factor F3 from Thermoplasma acidophilum (10Kyrieleis O.J. Goettig P. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Brandstetter H. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 787-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These enzymes show respective sequence identities of 15.7 and 15.3% to aminopeptidase N from E. coli. Leukotriene A4 hydrolase is a very unique enzyme that exhibits both aminopeptidase activity as well as hydrolysis of leukotriene A4. Although this enzyme differs markedly from other peptidases in this respect, the structural analysis of leukotriene A4 hydrolase has demonstrated that the enzymes in this family possess a thermolysin-like catalytic domain (9Thunnissen M.M. Nordlund P. Haeggdtrom J.Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Moreover, the structural analysis of tricorn-interacting factor F3 revealed that two of four domains composing this enzyme, i.e. an N-terminal domain, which is composed of a β-sandwich structure and a catalytic domain, are similar to those of leukotriene A4 hydrolase (10Kyrieleis O.J. Goettig P. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Brandstetter H. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 787-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Significant sequence conservation is recognized in the two domains among three enzymes: aminopeptidase N has sequence identities of 17.1 and 18.8% to leukotriene A4 hydrolase and tricorn-interacting factor F3, respectively. However, the sequence identities of the C-terminal region to those of leukotriene A4 hydrolase and tricorn-interacting factor F3 are low: 12.8 and 13.0%, respectively. It was expected that the N-terminal and catalytic domains of aminopeptidase N may share a common folding pattern with this family of enzymes. The distinct structure of the C-terminal region is thought to be among those features that render these enzymes unique in terms of substrate specificity. Aminopeptidase N has broad specificity. This enzyme shows a hierarchical preference for substrates with N-terminal residues in the following order: Arg, Ala, and Lys. It is noteworthy that the enzyme shows a little activity against peptides with an N-terminal Pro residue (1Chandu D. Nandi D. Microbiology (Read.). 2003; 149: 3437-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 7Yoshimoto T. Tamase Y. Gushi K. Murayama N. Tsuru D. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1988; 52: 217-225Google Scholar). It should be noted that this hierarchy of preferences for favorite N-terminal residues differs from that of the human enzyme (11Huang K. Takahara S. Kinouchi T. Takeyama M. Ishida T. Ueyama H. Nishi K. Ohkubo I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To reveal catalytic and substrate recognition mechanisms of aminopeptidase N, we cloned the gene encoding the enzyme and expressed the enzyme in E. coli. This is the first report of the crystal structure of aminopeptidase N; the catalytic and substrate recognition mechanisms are also discussed. Materials—Ala-β-naphthylamide (βNA), Pro-βNA, Fast Garnet GBC, and bestatin (N-[(2S,3R)-3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutyryl]-l-leucine) hydrochloride were purchased from Sigma. Ala-Phe-Pro-βNA was purchased from Bachem AG (Bubendorf, Switzerland). DEAE-Toyopearl and Toyopearl HW65C were purchased from Tosoh Co. (Tokyo, Japan). MES and ammonium sulfate were purchased from Nacalai Tesque Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). Gly-Pro-βNA was synthesized according to a previously described procedure (12Yoshimoto T. Walter R. Tsuru D J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4786-4792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prolyl aminopeptidase from Bacillus coagulans (13Kitazono A. Yoshimoto T. Tsuru D. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7919-7925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (14Kabashima T. Ito K. Yoshimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 1111-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) were purified as described previously. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Media—E. coli XL1-Blue cells (recA1, endA1, gyrA96thi-1, hsdR17, supE44) were used for expression, together with the plasmid pBluescript II SK(-). The bacteria were grown in LB-broth and N-broth. Cloning of the pepN Gene—The pepN gene was isolated from Kohara clone 219. The phage DNA was digested with PstI and XhoI, and the 3.4-kb fragment containing the pepN open reading frame was cloned into the same restriction sites of pBluescript II SK(-) to produce pAN14. The nucleotide sequence of this clone was confirmed by DNA sequencing using the ABI PRISM 3100-Avant genetic analyzer with the BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Version 1.1). Purification of the Soluble Enzymes—E. coli XL1-Blue cells were transformed with the recombinant plasmid pAN14, and the transformants were grown at 310 K in 200 ml of LB-broth (50 μg/ml ampicillin). Then, the transformants were aerobically cultured in 20 liters of N-broth containing ampicillin (50 mg/liter) at 310 K for 17 h in a jar fermentor (MBS). The harvested cells (40 g, wet weight) were washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0). The washed cells were resuspended in the same buffer and disrupted by repeated sonication on an ice bath using an Tomy UD200 ultrasonic disruptor. To remove the nucleic acid, protamine sulfate (16 mg/g of cells, wet weight) was added to the solution. After the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 22,250 × g for 20 min at 297 K, the supernatant was fractionated with 35-80% saturated ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) containing 35% saturated ammonium sulfate, and the solution was applied to a Toyopearl HW65C column equilibrated with the same buffer. The enzymes were eluted with a linear gradient of 35 to 0% saturated ammonium sulfate. The eluted enzymes were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0), and the enzyme solution was applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl column equilibrated with the same buffer. After elution with a linear gradient of 0-1 m sodium chloride was carried out, the active fractions were combined and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0). The purity of the isolated enzyme was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The purified enzyme was concentrated to 28.0 mg/ml using a Centriprep YM-30 device (Millipore Corp.). Enzyme Activity Assay—The enzyme activity was assayed using Ala-βNA as the substrate. The reaction mixture consisted of 0.8 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.1 ml of enzyme solution, and 0.1 ml of a 3 mm solution of substrate. After a 10-min incubation at 310 K, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of Fast Garnet GBC solution (1 mg/ml) containing 10% Triton X-100 in 1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0). The absorbance at 550 nm was measured after 20 min. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that released 1 μmol of β-naphthylamine/min under the above conditions. To determine the Km values of aminopeptidase N for Ala-βNA and Pro-βNA, the concentration of the substrate was varied. Lineweaver-Burk plots were used to calculate Km and the apparent Vmax. The enzyme concentration was estimated based on a molar absorption coefficient of 113,650, and an Mr of 98,918 was used for the kcat calculations. The reactivity of mixed enzyme solutions was measured in a similar manner. The following enzyme solutions were used in this series: aminopeptidase N, prolyl aminopeptidase from B. coagulans, and dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV from S. maltophilia. The latter two enzymes were used alone or were mixed with aminopeptidase N for an assay using three substrates: Pro-βNA, Gly-Pro-βNA, and Ala-Phe-Pro-βNA. In the case of the assay using a mixture of two enzymes, the reaction mixture consisted of 0.7 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0), 0.1 ml of aminopeptidase N, 0.1 ml of the second enzyme solution, and 0.1mlofa3mm solution of substrate. For all activity measurements, the concentration of each enzyme was kept constant, i.e. 0.804 mg/ml aminopeptidase N, 0.100 μg/ml prolyl aminopeptidase, and 3.21 μg/ml dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV were used. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystallization was carried out at 293 K by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method using ammonium sulfate as a precipitant. A droplet was mixed with 28.0 mg/ml protein solution with the same amount of reservoir solution, and the sample was equilibrated against the reservoir solution (1.75 m ammonium sulfate and 100 mm MES buffer (pH 6.4)). After 5 days, prism crystals grew to dimensions of 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm, and they belonged to space group P3121 with the following cell dimensions: a = b = 120.5 and c = 170.8 Å and γ = 120°. One molecule was found in an asymmetric unit, and 66% of the crystal volume was occupied by solvent. Crystals of the enzyme-bestatin complex were obtained by soaking ligand-free crystals for 48 h in prepared solution containing 1 mm bestatin, 2.2 m ammonium sulfate, and 100 mm MES buffer (pH 6.4). The diffraction data for the ligand-free form and the enzyme-bestatin complex were collected to 1.50- and 1.60-Å resolution, respectively, at 100 K using a wavelength of 1.0000 Å from the synchrotron radiation source at the Photon Factory AR-NW12 station (Tsukuba, Japan). For data collection under cryogenic conditions, the crystals were soaked for 1 min in a prepared solution containing 30% (v/v) glycerol, 1.75 m ammonium sulfate, and 100 mm MES buffer (pH 6.4). The crystals were mounted in a nylon loop and flash-cooled at 100 K. The data sets for crystals soaked in 0.1 mm ethylmercurithiosalicylate for 12 h and in 0.1 mm methyl mercury chloride for 21 h were collected to 2.1- and 2.0-Å resolution, respectively, at 100 K with a Rigaku R-AXIS IV2+ detector using CuKα radiation, which was generated by a Rigaku MicroMax-007 rotating anode x-ray generator with osmic confocal focusing mirrors. The data set for the crystals soaked in 1 mm pCMB for 1 day was collected to 1.8-Å resolution at 100 K at the Photon Factory AR-NW12 station. The data for the ligand-free form and the enzyme-bestatin complex were processed and scaled by HKL-2000 (15Otowinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar), and the heavy atom derivative data were processed using MOSFLM (16Leslie A.G.W.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The phase problem was solved by the multiple isomorphous replacement method using three and two mercury sites from ethylmercurithiosalicylate and methyl mercury chloride derivatives, respectively. The scaling of all data and map calculations were performed with the CCP4 program suite (17Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The determination of mercury sites, the refinement of the heavy atom parameters, and the calculations of the initial phases were performed using the program SOLVE (18Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar), resulting in a mean figure of merit of 0.60 at 2.1-Å resolution. The map was improved by the process of solvent flattening with the program RESOLVE (19Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar) giving a mean figure of 0.77 at 2.1-Å resolution. The initial model was automatically built using the program ARP/wARP (20Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the model was manually complemented with the program Xtal-View (21McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graphics. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar). The structure of the ligand-free form was refined by simulated annealing and energy minimization with the program CNS (22Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Panni N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) using the data obtained from 30- to 1.50-Å resolution. The structure was examined by inspecting the composite omit map. Refinement and model rebuilding were alternately carried out using several cycles, and water molecules were then selected on the basis of the peak height and the distance criteria from the difference map. The water molecules with thermal factors exceeding 50 Å after refinement were removed from the list. Further model building and refinement cycles gave an R factor of 18.1% and Rfree of 19.1% using 228,266 reflections from 20- to 1.5-Å resolution. The maximal thermal factor of the water molecules was 50 Å2. The same refinement procedure was applied to the enzyme-bestatin complex, with the exception that the coordinates of the ligand-free form were used for the initial model. After a refinement cycle involving simulated annealing and energy minimization, the difference Fourier map obviously displayed the residual electron density corresponding to the bestatin bound at the active site. Water molecules were selected from the difference map, and further model building and refinement cycles were carried out, resulting in an R factor of 18.2% and Rfree of 19.4% using 186,911 reflections from 20- to 1.6-Å resolution. The maximal thermal factor of the water molecules was 41 Å2. Construction of Expression Plasmids and Purification of the Enzyme—Because high activity was confirmed in the soluble fraction of the extracts from E. coli XL1-Blue cells transformed with pAN14, it was used for production of the enzyme. After cultivation of the transformant in 20 liters of N-broth in a jar fermentor, aminopeptidase N was purified following sequential chromatography on Toyopearl HW65C and DEAE-Toyopearl columns. The enzyme was purified with a specific activity of 43.8-fold and a recovery of 40%. Activity against Proline-containing Substrates—The kinetic parameters of aminopeptidase N for Ala-βNA and Pro-βNA are shown in Table 2. The kcat/Km value for Pro-βNA was ∼0.38% of that for Ala-βNA. Although the reactivity of aminopeptidase N against Pro-βNA was very low, the enzyme was able to cleave the peptide bond of Pro-Xaa. However, neither Gly-Pro-βNA nor Ala-Phe-Pro-βNA was hydrolyzed to release β-naphthylamine, even after prolonged incubation times (Table 3). Prolyl aminopeptidase and dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV are serine peptidases that specifically release Pro and Xaa-Pro from the substrates, respectively (13Kitazono A. Yoshimoto T. Tsuru D. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7919-7925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kabashima T. Ito K. Yoshimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 1111-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A mixed solution of aminopeptidase N and prolyl aminopeptidase showed activity against only Pro-βNA among the three substrates. In contrast, an enzyme mixture of aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV degraded all three substrates. These results indicated that the peptide bond of Xaa-Pro was not hydrolyzed by aminopeptidase N.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters of aminopeptidase NSubstrateKmkcatkcat/Kmmms−1s−1 mm−1Ala-βNA0.304±0.01063.7±2.7210Pro-βNA0.932±0.1020.743±0.0430.797 Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Apparent velocity against substrates containing a Pro residuePro-βNAGly-Pro-βNAAla-Phe-Pro-βNAμmol/minμmol/minμmol/minAPN31.2±1.800PAP321±2800DPIV0165±70APN and PAP369±500APN and DPIV29.9±0.682.2±0.895.4±9.2 Open table in a new tab Quality of the Structure—The refined ligand-free model contains 865 residues, a zinc ion, a sulfate anion, and 1127 water molecules with an R factor of 18.1% at 1.5-Å resolution. The model contained Ala122 of the cis-peptide. On the basis of the electron density map, the conformation of Ala122 was confirmed. This model lacks the five N-terminal residues because of a lack of interpretable electron density. The average thermal factors of the main chain atoms, the side chain atoms, and the water molecules were 14.3, 19.9, and 28.9 Å2, respectively. Analysis of the stereochemistry with PROCHECK (23Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) demonstrated that all of the main chain atoms fell within the additional allowed region of the Ramachandran plot, with 734 residues (93.0%) in the most favored region and 55 residues (7.0%) in the additional allowed region. The refined model of the enzyme-bestatin complex contains 867 residues without the three N-terminal residues, a bestatin, a zinc ion, a sulfate anion, and 946 water molecules with an R factor of 18.2% at 1.6-Å resolution. The average thermal factors of the main chain atoms, side chain atoms, bestatin, and water molecules were 13.8, 18.6, 19.6, and 25.6 Å2, respectively. Based on the PROCHECK analysis, 735 residues fell within the most favored region and 55 residues within the additional allowed region of the Ramachandran plot. Overall Structure and Subunit Assembly—The overall structure and surface of aminopeptidase N are shown in Fig. 1 (a and b). Aminopeptidase N has dimensions of ∼85 × 60 × 45 Å and an accessible surface area of 32,749 Å2 as calculated using AREAIMOL from the CCP4 suite (17Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The C-α positions of the ligand-free form were superposed onto those of the enzyme-bestatin complex, with a root mean square deviation of 0.09 Å, indicating that both structures are identical. The structure of aminopeptidase N consists of 26 α-helices and 26 β-strands and can be divided into four domains, i.e. an N-terminal β-domain (Met1-Asp193), a catalytic domain (Phe194-Gly444), a middle β-domain (Thr445-Trp546), and a C-terminal α-domain (Ser547-Ala870). The first three domains, in sequence, are connected in a linear fashion, and the last domain is located at the side of the catalytic domain, serving as a cover for this domain. Consequently, the catalytic domain interacts with all other domains, and the domain interface areas of the catalytic domain, calculated on the basis of the accessible surface area, are 741 Å2 (with the N-terminal β-domain), 423 Å2 (with the middle β-domain), and 852 Å2 (with the C-terminal α-domain), respectively. The domain interface area between the middle β-domain and the C-terminal α-domain was found to be 298 Å2. Although the N-terminal β-domain interacts primarily with the catalytic domain, a significant interaction with the C-terminal α-domain was observed with a domain interface of 112 Å2. The hydrophobic interaction was found to be predominant on all domain interfaces. The N-terminal β-domain forms a β-sandwich structure composed of three β-sheets. The seven-stranded β-sheet (β12β13β10β1β2β7β4) is located on the opposite side of the three-stranded (β3β5β6) and four-stranded (β11β14β9β8) antiparallel β-sheets. The seven- and three-stranded β-sheets were exposed to the solvent area, and the four-stranded β-sheet was found to be involved predominantly in the domain interface with a β-sheet of the catalytic domain. The catalytic domain has an α/β-structure formed by a five-stranded β-sheet and eight α-helices, and this domain is similar to thermolysin, an endopeptidase. The catalytic domain was superposed on Bacillus thermoproteolyticus thermolysin (Protein Data Bank code 4TLN) (24Holmes M.A. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6912-6920Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), with a root mean square deviation of 1.78 Å for the corresponding 191 C-α positions. The middle β-domain is composed of two β-sheets (β24β21β20β26 and β23β22β25) and forms a β-sandwich structure. The structure of this domain is unique, and the role this domain plays within organisms remains unclear. The C-terminal α-domain is composed of 18 helices (α9-α26), and these helices are arranged in an antiparallel manner. The C-terminal α-domain has two layers of parallel α-helices: eight in the inner layer (α10, α12, α16, α18, α20, α22, α24, and α26) and eight in the outer layer (α9, α11, α15, α17, α19, α21, α23, and α25). These helices form an arched helical bundle, and then two helices (α13 and α14) are positioned such that they block the arched entrance. Consequently, the C-terminal α-domain has a hole at the center, as shown in Fig. 1b, the diameter of which is ∼8Å. Aminopeptidase N has a metalbinding motif (HEXXHX18E) in the catalytic domain, which is well conserved in peptidase family M1 (25Hooper N.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). There are two histidine residues from the α2-helix and a third ligating glutamate residue from the α3-helix. The active site is found in a groove that consists of one β-strand and three α-helices; the β18-strand and the α5-helix form each side wall, and the α2- and α3-helices serv"
https://openalex.org/W2164574344,"Caspase activation has been extensively studied in the context of apoptosis. However, caspases also control other cellular functions, although the mechanisms regulating caspases in nonapoptotic contexts remain obscure. Drosophila IAP1 (DIAP1) is an endogenous caspase inhibitor that is crucial for regulating cell death during development. Here we describe Drosophila IKK-related kinase (DmIKKvarepsilon) as a regulator of caspase activation in a nonapoptotic context. We show that DmIKKvarepsilon promotes degradation of DIAP1 through direct phosphorylation. Knockdown of DmIKKvarepsilon in the proneural clusters of the wing imaginal disc, in which nonapoptotic caspase activity is required for proper sensory organ precursor (SOP) development, stabilizes endogenous DIAP1 and affects Drosophila SOP development. Our results demonstrate that DmIKKvarepsilon is a determinant of DIAP1 protein levels and that it establishes the threshold of activity required for the execution of nonapoptotic caspase functions."
https://openalex.org/W2002566479,"Long-range hydrophobic interactions operating underwater are important in the mediation of many natural and synthetic phenomena, such as protein folding, adhesion and colloid stability. Here we show that rough hydrophobic surfaces can experience attractive forces over distances more than 30 times greater than any reported previously, owing to the spontaneous evaporation of the intervening, confined water. Our finding highlights the importance of surface roughness in the interaction of extended structures in water, which has so far been largely overlooked."

We compared in vitro hydroxylation by purified recombinant human HIF-P4Hs of 19–20- and 35-residue peptides corresponding to the two sites in HIF-αs and purified recombinant HIF-1α and HIF-2α ODDDs of 248 and 215 residues. The increase in the length of peptides representing the C-terminal site from 19 to 20 to 35 residues reduced the Km values to 90–800 nm, i.e. to 0.7–11% of those for the shorter peptides, whereas those representing the N-terminal site were 10–470 μm, i.e. 10–135%. The Km values of HIF-P4H-1 for the recombinant HIF-α ODDDs were 10–20 nm, whereas those of HIF-P4H-2 and -3 were 60–140 nm, identical values being found for the wild-type HIF-1α ODDD and its N site mutant. The Km values for the C site mutant were about 5–10 times higher but only 0.2–3% of those for the 35-residue N site peptides, and this marked difference suggested that the HIF-P4Hs may become bound first to the C-terminal site of an ODDD and that this binding may enhance subsequent binding to the N-terminal site. The Km values of HIF-P4H-2 for oxygen determined with the HIF-1α ODDD and both its mutants as substrates were all about 100 μm, being 40% of those reported for the three HIF-P4Hs with a 19-residue peptide. Even this value is high compared with tissue O2 levels, indicating that HIF-P4Hs are effective oxygen sensors.

HIFs are heterodimers that consist of an oxygen-regulated α subunit (HIF-α) and a stable β subunit (HIF-β), and both types of subunits are members of the basic helix-loop-helix Per-Arnt-Sim protein family. The human α subunit has three isoforms, HIF-1α to HIF-3α (for reviews, see Refs. 1Semenza G.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (5204) Google Scholar, 2Schofield C.J.

HIF-1α and HIF-2α are synthesized continuously, and hydroxylation of at least one of two critical proline residues in their oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODDD), Pro402 and Pro564 in HIF-1α, generates a binding site for the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase complex that targets them for rapid proteasomal degradation under normoxic conditions (4Ivan M.

The lack of oxygen inhibits these hydroxylations so that HIF-αs are no longer recognized by the VHL protein and degraded but instead dimerize with HIF-β.

A 19-residue peptide corresponding to the N-terminal hydroxylation site in HIF-1α had much higher Km values for HIF-P4H-1 and -2 than the C-terminal site peptide and was not hydroxylated by HIF-P4H-3 to any significant extent at all, whereas a 19-residue peptide corresponding to the N-terminal site in HIF-2α was hydroxylated by all three isoenzymes, but again with distinctly higher Km values than the corresponding C-terminal site peptide (21Hirsilä M.

The HIF-α fragments correspond to the ODDDs and contain both proline hydroxylation sites in the same polypeptide, which made it possible to study whether this situation differs from the presence of the two sites in separate peptides. Hydroxylation of only one of the two sites in the HIF-1α ODDD could be studied using its two mutants, P402A and P564A. A recent study has indicated that Pro564 in HIF-1α is hydroxylated before Pro402 in cultured cells and that hydroxylation of Pro402 is inhibited at higher oxygen tensions than that of Pro564 (23Chan D.A. Sutphin P.D. Yen S.-E. Giaccia A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6415-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We therefore also determined the Km values of HIF-P4H-2 for O2 in the hydroxylation of the wild-type and the two mutant HIF-1α ODDDs. Our data indicate that increasing the peptide length from 19 to 20 to 35 residues has a marked effect on the Km values for peptides representing the C-terminal hydroxylation site in all three HIF-α isoforms, whereas more modest or no effects are seen in the case of peptides representing the N-terminal site. The Km values determined for the C-terminal hydroxylation site in the recombinant HIF-1α ODDD are in most cases still somewhat lower than those for the corresponding 35-residue peptides, whereas the Km values for its N-terminal site are markedly lower than those for the 35-residue N site peptides, and this site had a low Km value even for HIF-P4H-3, which had very high Km values for the corresponding 20- and 35-residue peptides. The Km value of HIF-P4H-2 for O2 determined with the HIF-1α ODDD was lower than that reported with a 19-residue peptide, but was still high, about 100 μm, and no difference was found in this Km value when determined with the wild-type or the two mutant ODDDs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Purification of Recombinant HIF-P4Hs—FLAG His-tagged HIF-P4H-1–3 (24Hirsilä M.

The cells, seeded at a density of 1 × 106/ml, were infected with recombinant baculoviruses at a multiplicity of 5, harvested 72 h after infection, and then were washed with a solution of 0.15 m NaCl and 0.02 m phosphate, pH 7.4, and homogenized in a buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine, 10 μm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 or 5 μm FeSO4, and 0.01 m Tris, pH 7.8, supplemented with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The recombinant HIF-P4Hs were purified from the soluble fractions with an anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) (24Hirsilä M. Koivunen P. Xu L. Seeley T. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J.

The NdeI-XhoI-digested PCR fragments were cloned into a similarly cut pET-22b(+) Escherichia coli expression vector (Novagen) in-frame with a C-terminal histidine tag. Site-directed mutagenesis of the HIF-1α ODDD to P402A and P564A mutant ODDDs and to P402A/P564A double mutant ODDD was performed using the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene). The expression plasmids were transformed into the E. coli BL21(DE3) strain (Novagen), and the cells were grown at 37 °C to an absorbance of 0.4 at 600 nm, and expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested after a 3-h induction, solubilized, and boiled in the SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min, and expression of the recombinant ODDDs was analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by Coomassie Blue staining.The recombinant ODDDs were purified from 150–300-ml cultures on a chelating Sepharose column charged with Ni2+ (ProBond, Invitrogen). The cells were harvested after a 3-h induction, suspended in 1/20 volume of a 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, supplemented with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), disrupted by sonication, and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 20 min, and the soluble fractions were applied to a chelating Sepharose column stabilized with a solution of 0.5 m NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. The column was washed with the same buffer containing 0.02 m imidazole and eluted with a 150-ml linear imidazole gradient (0.02–0.3 m), and the fractions were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing the recombinant ODDD polypeptides were pooled and concentrated using Amicon ultracentrifugal devices with Mr 5,000 cut-off membrane (Millipore) and applied to a Superdex S-200 column (Amersham Biosciences) in a 0.3 m NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0. Fractions of 2 ml were collected and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. Those containing the pure ODDD polypeptides were pooled, and their buffer was changed to 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, by concentrating as above, and the protein concentrations were measured by RotiQuant (Carl Roth GmbH).HIF-P4H Activity Assays—HIF-P4H activity was assayed by a method based on measurement of the hydroxylation-coupled stoichiometric release of 14CO2 from 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate in a final reaction volume of 0.5 ml (21Hirsilä M.

The Km values of the purified enzymes for the synthetic HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and HIF-3α peptides (Table 1), the recombinant ODDD polypeptides, and of HIF-P4H-2 for O2 with the wild-type HIF-1α ODDD and its P402A and P564A mutants as substrates were determined as described previously (21Hirsilä M.

The purities of the synthetic HIF-α peptides (Innovagen) were about 80%. The Km values for the 19–20-residue and 35-residue peptides and the ODDD polypeptides were determined using 2-oxoglutarate with a specific activity of 1100 or 11,100, 11,100 or 55,500, and 55,500 dpm/nmol, respectively. The relative Vmax values of each HIF-P4H for the various peptide substrates were determined with respect to that obtained with the 19-residue peptide representing the C-terminal hydroxylation site of HIF-1α in the same experiment.TABLE 1Amino acid sequences of the synthetic peptides used as substratesPeptideAmino acid sequenceHIF-1αC19DLDLEMLAPYIPMDDDFQLHIF-1αC35KNPFSTGDTDLDLEMLAPYIPMDDDFQLRSFDQLSHIF-2αC19ELDLETLAPYIPMDGEDFQHIF-2αC20ELDLETLAPYIPMDGEDFQLHIF-2αC35QCSTQTDFNELDLETLAPYIPMDGEDFQLSPICPEHIF-3α20DALDLEMLAPYISMDDDFQLHIF-3α35DLDIAQDADALDLEMLAPYISMDDDFQLNASEQLPHIF-1αN20DALTLLAPAAGDTIISLDFGHIF-1αN20A566PDALTLLAPAPGDTIISLDFGHIF-1αN20A558EDELTLLAPAAGDTIISLDFGHIF-1αN35SLFDKLKKEPDALTLLAPAAGDTIISLDFGSNDTEHIF-2αN20EPEELAQLAPTPGDAIISLDHIF-2αN35FLFTKLKEEPEELAQLAPTPGDAIISLDFGNQNFE Open table in a new tab In additional experiments HIF-P4H-3 activity was assayed by using l-[2,3,4,5-3H]proline-labeled substrates and measuring the amount of 4-hydroxy[3H]proline formed. The cDNAs for the wild-type, P402A and P564A mutant, and the P402A/P564A double mutant HIF-1α ODDDs in pET-22b(+) were translated in the presence of l-[2,3,4,5-3H]proline (85 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in rabbit reticulocyte lysate using a TnT® Quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). The translation products were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. Aliquots of 45 μl of the translation products containing ∼2 × 106 cpm of incorporated radioactive proline were used as substrates for the purified recombinant HIF-P4H-3 in a final reaction volume of 1 ml under the reaction conditions described previously (21Hirsilä M.

In control experiments the recombinant HIF-P4H-3 was omitted. The enzyme reactions were dialyzed extensively to remove any remaining free l-[2,3,4,5-3H]proline, and the 4-hydroxy[3H]proline formed in the substrate was analyzed by a specific radiochemical procedure (25Juva K.

The 35-residue peptides were designed to contain 17 amino acids on each side of the proline to be hydroxylated (Table 1). The Km values of the HIF-P4Hs were determined by a method based on measurement of the hydroxylation-coupled stoichiometric release of 14CO2 from 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate (21Hirsilä M. Koivunen P.

As the 19-residue HIF-2α peptide studied previously ended just before a leucine subsequently reported to influence hydroxylation (22Kageyama Y. Koshiji M. To K.K.W. Tian Y.-M. Ratcliffe P.J. Huang L.E. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1028-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we also determined the Km values for a 20-residue peptide containing this leucine (Table 1). Its Km values were about 50–70% of those for the 19-residue peptide, indicating that the leucine had a distinct although relatively modest effect (Table 2).TABLE 2Km and Vmax values of the HIF-P4H isoenzymes for peptides representing the C-terminal hydroxylation site in HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and HIF-3αPeptideHIF-P4H-1HIF-P4H-2HIF-P4H-3KmVmaxaThe Vmax values are expressed relative to that obtained for each enzyme with the HIF-1αC19 peptide.nKmVmaxaThe Vmax values are expressed relative to that obtained for each enzyme with the HIF-1αC19 peptide.nKmVmaxaThe Vmax values are expressed relative to that obtained for each enzyme with the HIF-1αC19 peptide.nμm%μm%μm%HIF-1αC19bThe values shown for these peptides include those determined previously (21), in most cases together with some additional values determined in this study.10 ± 5100107 ± 210055 ± 310010HIF-1αC350.3 ± 0.06100 ± 1060.8 ± 0.295 ± 430.09 ± 0.0390 ± 306HIF-2αC19bThe values shown for these peptides include those determined previously (21), in most cases together with some additional values determined in this study.30 ± 1070 ± 15730 ± 1080 ± 25310 ± 685 ± 104HIF-2αC2020 ± 5105 ± 10315 ± 2105 ± 1536 ± 380 ± 153HIF-2αC350.15 ± 0.0580 ± 1540.4 ± 0.275 ± 1030.2 ± 0.0760 ± 203HIF-3αC20bThe values shown for these peptides include those determined previously (21), in most cases together with some additional values determined in this study.8 ± 5115 ± 3320 ± 6140 ± 2034 ± 3120 ± 103HIF-3αC350.2 ± 0.06120 ± 2560.6 ± 0.1110 ± 1530.2 ± 0.07110 ± 203a The Vmax values are expressed relative to that obtained for each enzyme with the HIF-1αC19 peptide.b The values shown for these peptides include those determined previously (21Hirsilä M.

The Km values of HIF-P4H-2 for the three 35-residue peptides were higher than those of the other two isoenzymes (at least p < 0.01), the lowest Km being that of HIF-P4H-3 for the 35-residue HIF-1α peptide, 90 nm (Table 2). Interestingly, the increase in peptide length from 19–20 to 35 residues had no significant effect on the Vmax values, although there was a tendency for slightly lower Vmax values with the longer peptides in some cases (Table 2).An Increase in the Peptide Length from 19–20 to 35 Residues Has Relatively Small Effects on the Km Values for Peptides Representing the N-terminal Hydroxylation Site in HIF-1α and HIF-2α—The Km values for 19–20-residue peptides representing the N-terminal hydroxylation site in HIF-1α and HIF-2α are much higher than those for the 19-residue peptides representing the C-terminal site (21Hirsilä M.

As the 19-residue peptide representing the N-terminal site in HIF-1α was subsequently found to erroneously lack an aspartate located in position +10 with respect to the proline to be hydroxylated, a new 20-residue peptide containing this aspartate (Table 1) was used here as the reference peptide (Table 3). The Km values of HIF-P4H-1 and -2 for this 20-residue peptide were about 50 μm, i.e. 5–7 times those for the corresponding C-terminal site peptide, whereas the Km of HIF-P4H-3 was 620 μm, i.e. more than 100 times that for the C site peptide (Tables 2 and 3).

In this study we identify novel signaling and functional loops of iPLA2 activation leading to migration of non-apoptotic human ovarian cancer cells. The extracellular matrix protein, laminin-10/11, but not collagen I, induces integrin- and caspase-3-dependent cleavage and activation of overexpressed and endogenous iPLA2. The truncated iPLA2 (amino acids 514-806) generates lysophosphatidic acid and arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is important for enhancing cell migration toward laminin-10/11. Lysophosphatidic acid activates Akt that in turn acts in a feedback loop to block the cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase and DNA fragmentation factor as well as prevent apoptosis. By using pharmacological inhibitors, blocking antibodies, and genetic approaches (such as point mutations, dominant negative forms of genes, and siRNAs against specific targets), we show that β1, but not β4, integrin is involved in iPLA2 activation and cell migration to laminin-10/11. The role of caspase-3 in iPLA2 activation and cell migration are supported by several lines of evidence. 1) Point mutation of Asp513 (a cleavage site of caspase-3 in iPLA2) to Ala blocks laminin-10/11-induced cleavage and activation of overexpressed iPLA2, whereas mutation of Asp733 to Ala has no such effect, 2) treatment of inhibitors or a small interfering RNA against caspase-3 results in decreased cell migration toward laminin-10/11, and 3) selective caspase-3 inhibitor blocks cleavage of endogenous iPLA2 induced by laminin-10/11.

These enzymes are classified into three groups based on their cellular localization, substrate specificity, and calcium dependence. The secreted PLA2 family consists of low molecular weight, calcium-requiring secretory enzymes that have been implicated in modification of eicosanoid generation, inflammation, and atherosclerosis (1Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) is believed to play an essential role in the release of arachidonic acid in response to extracellular stimuli. Intracellular activation of cPLA2 is tightly regulated by calcium and phosphorylation (2Laye J.P. Gill J.H. Drug Discov. Today. 2003; 8: 710-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The third group of PLA2 enzymes is calcium-independent PLA2 (iPLA2). One of the functions of iPLA2 is to control phospholipid levels and maintain homeostasis through remodeling of membrane structures (3Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Annu. Rev.

This implies caspase-3-mediated activation of iPLA2. More recently, direct evidence shows that iPLA2 can be cleaved at Asp513 and Asp733 by caspase-3, resulting in a truncated iPLA2 lacking ankyrin-repeat domain (22Bartolazzi A. Kaczmarek J. Nicolo G.

Immunol. 2001; 167: 3414-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms regarding iPLA2 activation under these non-apoptotic conditions remain to be elucidated.In this work we investigate the molecular mechanisms of iPLA2 activation induced by laminin-10/11. In particular, the potential involvement of caspase-3 and β1 integrin is examined. We reveal novel caspase-dependent, but apoptosis-independent activation of iPLA2, which plays important roles in cell migration. These include β1 integrin- and caspase-3-dependent cleavage and production of a truncation-activated iPLA2 that produces LPA, LPA-induced intracellular signaling resulting in arachidonic acid (AA) production and an AA-dependent cell migration, and LPA-Akt activation-mediated inhibition of cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) as well as apoptosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for iPLA2 was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI).

Bohn E. Krober S.M. Xiao Y.J. Blumenthal S.G. Lindemann R.K. Marini P. Wiedig C. Zobywalski A. Baksh S. Xu Y. Autenrieth I.B. Schulze-Osthoff K. Belka C. Stuhler G. Wesselborg S.

Removal of enhanced green fluorescent protein from pEGFP-N1 vector and pEGFP-N1-iPLA2 aa 1-806 was accomplished by digestion of the above plasmids with SmaI and NotI followed by treatment with Klenow fragment (Invitrogen) and T4-DNA ligase (Roche Applied Science). For construction of PN1-iPLA2 aa 535-733, a 25-cycle PCR program was employed with sense primer of 5′-ATCGAAGCTTGCCTACATGCGCGGCAT-3′ and antisense primer of 5′-CTCGGAATTCTCAGTCCACCACCAT-3′. The purified PCR fragment was cloned into the HindIII/EcoRI sites of pN1 vector, and the sequence was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Point mutants of iPLA2 Asp513, Asp733, and Ser519 to Ala were generated by using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), verified by sequencing. The dominant negative Akt (DN-Akt) construct was from Dr. D. Templeton (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH).Cell Culture, Transfection, and Western Blotting—Malignant ovarian HEY cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For transient transfection, cells (5 × 105) were cultured in 6-well plates overnight and transfected with DNA using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers' instruction. iPLA2 expression in the transfected cells was evaluated by Western blotting analyses. Collected cells were rinsed with icecold PBS, and equal number of cells from each indicated condition were lysed with SDS sample buffer (Bio-Rad). Samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). After blocking overnight with 5% milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were probed with the indicated antibodies and corresponding secondary antibodies and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences). The cells were serum-starved for 16 h before exposure to ECM proteins.siRNA Experiments and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Sequences of siRNA are as follows: iPLA2, 5′-GGAUCUCAUGCACAUCUCAtt-3′; caspase-3 5′-UGAGGUAGCUUCAUAGUGGtt-3′; GFP, 5′-GCAAGCUGACCCUGAAGUUCAT-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase catalog #4805; targeting protein of accession number NM_ 002046. siRNA was purchased from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). Each indicated siRNA was delivered to cells with Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was extracted 48 h after treatment using SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega, Madison, WI). The expression levels of siRNA targets were detected by reverse transcription-PCR. Primer sequences are as follows: iPLA2, 5′-AACGTTAACCTCAGGCCTCC-3′ and 5′-GAGAGTTTCTTCACCTTGTT-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGT-3′ and 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′.iPLA2 Activity Assay—Equal numbers of control and iPLA2-transfected HEY cells were washed twice in PBS. Cells were then resuspended in 200 μl of buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.34 m sucrose followed by sonication (2 × 10 s), and the resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Collected supernatant was used for the reaction as described by Carnevale and Cathcart (14Carnevale K.A. Cathcart M.K. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3414-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In brief, dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (100 μm) and 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phopshocholine (300,000 cpm/assay) were evaporated to dryness under an N2 stream, and a buffer (125 μl) containing 800 μm Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, and 200 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) was added. Micelles were then formed by a combination of heating above 40 °C, vortexing, and water bath sonication until the solution was clarified. The reaction was initiated by mixing cell lysates with the substrate and 0.8 mm ATP in a final volume of 250 μl and incubated at 40 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped, and the lipids were extracted by adding 0.5 ml of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (2:4:1, v/v/v) followed by 0.25 ml of chloroform and 0.25 ml of H2O. The lipids in the chloroform layer were dried under an N2 stream, resuspended in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), separated on Silica Gel TLC plates in a solvent mixture of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (25/15/4/2, v/v/v/v), and visualized with 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid. Fatty acids generated by the PLA activity and phosphatidylcholine were scraped and counted in a scintillation counter. Normalized activity represents cpm of free fatty acid divided by the cpm of free fatty plus the cpm of the dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine times the total added counts (300,000 cpm).Cell-based Enzymatic Activity Assay of PLA2—The principle of this cell-based fluorescence dequenching assay for PLA2 has been described (15Feng L. Manabe K. Shope J.C. Widmer S. DeWald D.B. Prestwich G.D. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 795-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, parental or vector- or iPLA2-transfected HEY cells were serum-starved overnight, collected, and washed with sterile PBS. Cells were then resuspended in PBS and allowed to attach to positively charged glass slides for 20 min. The cells were incubated with 1 μg of 1-O-(6-dabcyl-aminohexanoyl)-2-O-(6-[12-BODIPY-dodecanoyl]amino-hexanoyl)-sn-3-glycerophosphatidylcholine resuspended in 30 μl of PBS. Cells were then washed with PBS followed by imaging with excitation wavelength of 488 nm and filtered emission detection at 515 nm. Imaging was performed using a Leica fluorescence microscope, and fluorescence intensity was measured using Image-Pro software.Migration Assay—Cell migration assays were performed as described previously (13Sengupta S. Xiao Y.J. Xu Y. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1570-1572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the lower face of the top chamber of the Corning Costar Transwell migration plate (Fisher) was coated with or without laminin-10/11 at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Lipids were added to the upper or lower chamber for each indicated condition. Serum-starved cells (1 × 105/100 μl) were added to the upper chamber. The Transwell chambers were then incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. After incubation the top chambers were rinsed with PBS and swabbed with a cotton swab to remove non-migrated cells. Migrated cells were fixed by methanol for 30 min and stained with hematoxylin 7211 (Richard-Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI) followed by washing with water. Migrated cells were counted in five high-power fields by eye using a light microscope after the chambers were dried. Pictures were taken with Nikon SMZ 1000 microscope. The caspase-3 activity assay was performed using specific colorimetric activity assay kits (Chemicon International) following their instructions. Briefly, samples were resuspended in chilled cell lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation, the cytosolic extract was collected, and the assay mixture was prepared in a 96-well plate. Inhibitors were preincubated with the caspase sample for 30 min at room temperature before adding the caspase-3 substrate solution. Assay mixtures were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, and caspase activities were measured by reading the absorbance of their products at 405 nm in a microtiter plate reader.Lipid Extraction and Mass Spectrometric Assay—The methods for LPA extraction and mass spectroscopy assay were described previously (16Xiao Y.J. Schwartz B. Washington M. Kennedy A. Webster K. Belinson J. Xu Y. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 290: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In brief, LPA was extracted from culture supernatant by acidified MeOH/chloroform and separated on a TLC plate; LPA was eluted from the plate. Electrospray ionization (ESI)-mass spectroscopy and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analyses were performed using a Micromass Quattro Ultima triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI source (Micromass, Beverley, MA) in the Mass Spectrometry II Core at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. 14:0 LPA was used as an internal standard in the negative mode of detection.Analysis of Arachidonic Acid Using High Performance Liquid Chromatography On-line Tandem Mass Spectrometry—For extraction of arachidonic acid, a 1-ml sample was acidified with 20 μl of 0.75 m HCl, mixed with 1 ml mixture of 2-isopropanol/hexane/2 m acetic acid (80/120/4, v/v/v), then mixed with an additional 2 ml of hexane; the fatty acids were extracted to the hexane layer and further dried under nitrogen flow. Extracted fatty acids were resuspended in 85% methanol and centrifuged at 6000 × g for 10 min, and 20 μl of each supernatant was injected onto a Prodigy C-18 column (2.1 × 150 mm, 5 μm). The separation of fatty acids was performed using methanol/water/acetic acid (85/15/0.1, v/v/v) over 4 min, a gradient from methanol/water/acetic acid (85/15/0.1, v/v/v) to methanol/acetic acid (100/1, v/v) over 2 min, and then methanol/acetic acid (100/1, v/v) over 9 min. The column effluent was introduced onto a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Analysis was performed using electrospray ionization in negative-ion mode with multiple reactions monitoring of parent and characteristic daughter ions specific for arachidonic acid with mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 303→259. An external calibration curve constructed with authentic standard was used to quantify arachidonic acid.RESULTSOverexpression of iPLA2 Increases Cellular PLA2 and Cell Migratory Activities—We previously reported the involvement of iPLA2 in laminin-10/11-induced migration of HEY ovarian cancer cells (13Sengupta S. Xiao Y.J. Xu Y. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1570-1572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further evaluate the role of iPLA2 activity in cell migration, we overexpressed different iPLA2 constructs (Fig. 1, A and E) in HEY cells and analyzed their effects on cell migration. These constructs include the full-length iPLA2, iPLA2 (encoding aa 514-733 that can be generated by two-site cleavage of caspase-3 (11Lauber K. Bohn E. Krober S.M. Xiao Y.J. Blumenthal S.G. Lindemann R.K. Marini P. Wiedig C. Zobywalski A. Baksh S. Xu Y. Autenrieth I.B. Schulze-Osthoff K. Belka C. Stuhler G. Wesselborg S. Cell. 2003; 113: 717-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar)), iPLA2 (encoding aa 514-806 that can be generated by one-site cleavage of caspase-3 (11Lauber K. Bohn E. Krober S.M. Xiao Y.J. Blumenthal S.G. Lindemann R.K. Marini P. Wiedig C. Zobywalski A. Baksh S. Xu Y. Autenrieth I.B. Schulze-Osthoff K. Belka C. Stuhler G. Wesselborg S. Cell. 2003; 113: 717-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar)), and iPLA2 (encoding aa 535-733, with the catalytic site removed). Transfection of these forms of iPLA2 into HEY cells resulted in expression of peptides with predicted molecular weights, which are recognized by the antibody against the aa 557-576 region of the iPLA2 (Fig. 1A).The enzymatic activities of PLA2 in transfected HEY cells were analyzed using a well established micelle-based in vitro assay (14Carnevale K.A. Cathcart M.K. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3414-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 17Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). HEY cells transfected with all three forms of iPLA2 containing the consensus lipase motif GXSXG had increased PLA2 activity as compared with parental or vector-transfected cells and the truncated forms of iPLA2 had higher activities than that of the full-length iPLA2. As predicted, iPLA2 (aa 535-733) did not shown any PLA activity (data not shown). We also conducted PLA2 activity assays using a recently developed cell-based fluorescence method (15Feng L. Manabe K. Shope J.C. Widmer S. DeWald D.B. Prestwich G.D. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 795-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Ren J. Xiao Y. Singh L. Zhao X. Zhao Z. Feng L.

Biol. 2006; 1: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The results from these assays are shown in Fig. 1B. Normalizing of expression levels and the fluorescent intensity and taking the activity of the most active iPLA2 form (aa 514-733) as 100%, the activity levels were 36 ± 10 and 77 ± 17% for the full-length and aa 514-806 forms, respectively (Fig. 1B). These results support the notion that iPLA2 isoforms without the ankyrin repeats are active as reported in other cell types (7Atsumi G. Murakami M. Kojima K. Hadano A. Tajima M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18248-18258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 11Lauber K. Bohn E. Krober S.M. Xiao Y.J. Blumenthal S.G. Lindemann R.K. Marini P. Wiedig C. Zobywalski A. Baksh S. Xu Y. Autenrieth I.B. Schulze-Osthoff K. Belka C. Stuhler G. Wesselborg S. Cell. 2003; 113: 717-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar).To confirm the nature of the observed fluorescent signal, we pretreated cells with a selective inhibitor for iPLA2 (HELSS). As expected, HELSS (1 μm) significantly blocked the PLA2 activity in iPLA2-transfected cells (Fig. 1B, 2nd column and the lower panel), indicating that the detected fluorescence is mainly due to iPLA2 activity.To examine the cellular effect of iPLA2 activation on cell migration, we compared the migratory activities in HEY cells transfected with different forms of iPLA2. As shown in Fig. 1C, vector-transfected HEY cells had a similar basal level of migration to laminin-10/11 as that of parental HEY cells. Full-length iPLA2 overexpressing cells showed an approximate 10-fold increase in cell migration over the parental cells. The two truncated iPLA2 forms (aa 514-806 and 514-733) showed a much stronger effect on enhancing the migration of HEY cells to laminin-10/11 as compared with full-length iPLA2 (Fig. 1C). These migratory effects correlate with the enzymatic activity of iPLA2 (Fig. 1B), although a simple linear relationship may not exist. To directly address whether the enzymatic activity of iPLA2 is required for its migratory effect, we constructed a truncated form of iPLA2 (aa 535-733) in which the PLA2 catalytic site was removed. This construct encodes an iPLA2 of ∼22 kDa, which was expressed in transfected HEY cells (Fig. 1A, the second lane from the right). As expected, this iPLA2 form had neither detectable enzymatic activity (Fig. 1B) nor any effect on cell migration (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the enzymatic activity is required for migration.It is possible that the truncated form of iPLA2 exerts an unknown cellular effect(s). To address the relationship between the enzymatic activity and the migratory effect of iPLA2 more specifically, we constructed a point mutation at the catalytic site of iPLA2 by altering Ser519 to Ala. This mutant (S519A) expressed normally in cells (Fig. 1A, last lane) but did not have any increased enzymatic activity (Fig. 1B, last panel of the left column) nor did it increase cell migration above the control level (Fig. 1C), confirming that the enzymatic activity of iPLA2 is required for its migratory effect.We have previously shown that HEY cells have differential haptotactic activities toward different ECM proteins (33Ackermann E.J. Kempner E.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9227-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we compared the migratory potential toward collagen I versus laminin-10/11 in cells transfected with three iPLA2 isoforms. As shown in Fig. 1D, parental HEY cells as well as cells transfected with full-length iPLA2 had a higher haptotactic activity toward laminin-10/11 than toward collagen I. On the other hand, the haptotactic activities toward these two matrix proteins were similar in cells transfected with either of the truncated active iPLA2 forms. These results suggest that whereas laminin-10/11, but not collagen I, induces activation of full-length iPLA2, the product(s) derived from the active forms of iPLA2 stimulates cell migration to both laminin-10/11 and collagen I. This is consistent with our observation that collagen I does not induce cleavage of full-length iPLA2 (see Fig. 3A). Collectively, these data suggest that increased iPLA2 activity is correlated with the enhancement of HEY cell migration to laminin-10/11 (summarized in Fig. 1E).FIGURE 3Laminin-10/11-induced cleavage and activation of iPLA2 is caspase-dependent. A, cleavage of full-length iPLA2 in HEY cells upon contact with laminin-10/11. Parental and iPLA2-transfected cell lines were starved from serum for 16 h before culturing in plates precoated with laminin-10/11 (10 μg/ml) or collagen I (10 μg/ml) for 4 h. iPLA2 expression and cleavage were detected in collected cell lysates. Ab, antibody. B, representative pictures of cell-based enzymatic activity assay of PLA2 in iPLA2 (aa 1-806)-transfected HEY cells contacting laminin-10/11 (Ln). The same transfected cells cultured in regular plates were used as control. Fluorescence intensity was measured as described for Fig. 1B, and three pictures were used for statistical analysis. C, caspase-3-dependent cleavage of iPLA2. Equal numbers of full-length iPLA2-transfected HEY cells were starved from serum for 16 h, pretreated with an inhibitor (DEVD-CHO (2 μm) or benzyloxycarbonyl (Z)-VAD (50 μm) for 2 h) and then cultured for an additional4hin plates precoated"
https://openalex.org/W2005869317,"The mechanisms that enable the heart to rapidly increase ATP supply in line with increased demand have not been fully elucidated. Here we used an adenoviral system to express the photoproteins luciferase and aequorin, targeted to the mitochondria or cytosol of adult cardiomyocytes, to investigate the interrelationship between ATP and Ca(2+) in these compartments. In neither compartment were changes in free [ATP] observed upon increased workload (addition of isoproterenol) in myocytes that were already beating. However, when myocytes were stimulated to beat rapidly from rest, in the presence of isoproterenol, a significant but transient drop in mitochondrial [ATP] ([ATP](m)) occurred (on average to 10% of the initial signal). Corresponding changes in cytosolic [ATP] ([ATP](c)) were much smaller (<5%), indicating that [ATP](c) was effectively buffered in this compartment. Although mitochondrial [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)](m)) is an important regulator of respiratory chain activity and ATP production in other cells, the kinetics of mitochondrial Ca(2+) transport are controversial. Parallel experiments in cells expressing mitochondrial aequorin showed that the drop in [ATP](m) occurred over the same time scale as average [Ca(2+)](m) was increasing. Conversely, in the absence or presence of isoproterenol, clear beat-to-beat peaks in [Ca(2+)](m) were observed at 0.9 or 1.3 mum, respectively, concentrations similar to those observed in the cytosol. These results suggest that mitochondrial Ca(2+) transients occur during the contractile cycle and are translated into a time-averaged increase in mitochondrial ATP production that keeps pace with increased cytosolic demand."

The objective of this study is to elucidate the mechanism of insulin regulation of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase gene expression in human hepatocytes. Real-time PCR assays showed that physiological concentrations of insulin rapidly stimulated cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) mRNA expression in primary human hepatocytes but inhibited CYP7A1 expression after extended treatment. The insulin-regulated forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) and steroid regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) strongly inhibited hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α trans-activation of the CYP7A1 gene. FoxO1 binds to an insulin response element in the rat CYP7A1 promoter, which is not present in the human CYP7A1 gene. Insulin rapidly phosphorylates and inactivates FoxO1, whereas insulin induces nuclear SREBP-1c expression in human primary hepatocytes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay shows that insulin reduced FoxO1 and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor γ-coactivator-1α but increased SREBP-1c recruitment to CYP7A1 chromatin. We conclude that insulin has dual effects on human CYP7A1 gene transcription; physiological concentrations of insulin rapidly inhibit FoxO1 activity leading to stimulation of the human CYP7A1 gene, whereas prolonged insulin treatment induces SREBP-1c, which inhibits human CYP7A1 gene transcription.

How insulin regulates human CYP7A1 and what factors mediate the insulin effects remain unknown.Insulin is known to induce more than 100 genes but inhibit only a few hepatic genes involved in glucose metabolism (11Foufelle F. Ferre P. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 377-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The consensus sequence of negative insulin response element (IRE), T(G/A)TTT(T/G)(G/T), has been identified in promoters of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1, tyrosine aminotransferase, and apolipoprotein CIII genes (12O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). These IREs are known to bind hepatocyte nuclear factor 3α (HNF3α or FoxA1), but HNF3α does not mediate insulin action (12O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Recently forkhead box O1 (FoxO1), a mammalian homolog of Caenorhabditis elegans DAF-16 has been identified as an insulin-regulated transcription factor that plays a critical role in mediating insulin inhibition of the PEPCK, glucose-6-phosphatase, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1, and apolipoprotein CIII genes (13Hall R.K.

The phosphorylated FoxO1 is excluded from the nucleus and degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, which results in inhibition of FoxO1 target genes (19Zhang X. Gan L. Pan H. Guo S. He X.

Investig. 2004; 114: 1493-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar).Insulin stimulates the activity of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which are key regulators of lipid homeostasis and insulin actions (22Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. Le Liepvre X. Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J.B. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The predominant SREBP isoform, SREBP-1c in liver and adipose tissues, preferentially induces genes in fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis (23Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3685) Google Scholar). A SREBP precursor (125 kDa) forms a complex with SREBP cleavage-activating protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. Insulin inducing gene-1 and -2a (Insig) anchor the SREBP·SREBP cleavage-activating protein complex to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (24Engelking L.J. Kuriyama H. Hammer R.E. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Liang G. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 1168-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). When cellular sterol levels are low, Insigs release the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP)·SREBP complex and allow SCAP to escort SREBPs to the Golgi apparatus. Two sterol-regulated proteases act sequentially to release the N-terminal basic-helix-loop-helix leucine zipper domain. The mature SREBP (68 kDa) enters the nucleus, binds to the sterol regulatory element (SRE), and induces target gene transcription. Insulin stimulates liver orphan receptor α (LXRα) which induces SREBP-1c gene expression (25Tobin K.A. Ulven S.M. Schuster G.U. Steineger H.H. Andresen S.M. Gustafsson J.A. Nebb H.I. J. Biol.

Insulin also promotes SREBP-1c cleavage and increases insulin-stimulated lipogenesis by inhibition of Insig-2a expression in livers (11Foufelle F. Ferre P. Biochem.

Investig. 2004; 113: 1168-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that insulin-dependent proteolytic cleavage is crucial and sufficient for SREBP-1c activation (27Hegarty B.D. Bobard A. Hainault I. Ferre P. Bossard P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar).In this study we investigated the insulin regulation of CYP7A1 gene transcription in human hepatocytes. Results indicate that short-term treatment of physiological concentrations of insulin rapidly induces, whereas prolonged treatment of insulin represses human CYP7A1 gene expression. This dual effect of insulin action may be mediated by two insulin sensitive transcription factors, FoxO1 and SREBP-1c. This study provides new insights into how bile acid synthesis is regulated by insulin under normal physiological conditions and how dysregulation of bile acid homeostasis may contribute to glucose and lipid abnormalities in diabetes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—The human hepatoblastoma cell line, HepG2, was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).

The Gal4-HNF4α fusion plasmid pBx-HNF4-LBD was obtained from I. Talianidis (Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Foundation for Research and Technology, Hellas, Herakleion Crete, Greece).Transient Transfection Assay—HepG2 cells were grown to ∼80% confluence in 24-well tissue culture plates. Luciferase reporters and expression plasmids were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The pcDNA3 empty vector was added to normalize the amounts of DNA transfected in each assay. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed and expressed in relative luciferase units as described previously (28Li T. Chiang J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest.

RNA isolation, reverse transcription reactions, and real-time PCR were performed as described previously (29Song K.H. Li T. Chiang J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10081-10088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). All TaqMan Probes, CYP7A1 (HS00167982), FoxO1 (HS00231106), SREBP-1 (HS00231674), HNF4α (HS00230853), and UBC (HS00824723), were ordered from Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). PEPCK probe was custom made from Custom Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Ubiquitin C was used as an internal control for all PCR amplification reactions. Relative mRNA expression was quantified using the comparative Ct (ΔCt) method and expressed as 2–ΔΔCt. Each assay was done in triplicate and expressed as the mean ± S.D.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—FoxO1 and FoxA1 were synthesized in vitro using the transcription/translation (TNT) system programmed with the FoxO1 and FoxA1 expression plasmids according to the manufacturer's instruction (Promega). [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Synthetic oligonucleotides of complimentary strands were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and incubated with in vitro translated proteins (5 μl) as described previously (28Li T. Chiang J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2004; 288: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Gels were dried and autoradiographed using a PhosphorImager 445Si (GE Healthcare). Sequences of the probes (tagged with GATC at the 5′ end for labeling) used in the experiments are listed in the supplemental data. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by MWG Biotech (High Point, NC).Site-directed Mutagenesis—A PCR-based QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used for mutation of the reporter constructs; mutant rIRE2 sequence was introduced into rat p-344/luc plasmid, and the HNF4α binding site mutation was introduced into ph-1887/Luc plasmid as described previously (28Li T.

Antibodies against HNF4α (sc-8987), SREBP-1 (sc-366), and HA tag (sc-805, Lot#K0303) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and FoxO1 (#9462) was from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). Antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate chromatin. Non-immuno IgG (Santa Cruz) was used as negative control for immunoprecipitation. A 391-bp fragment containing the HNF4α binding site was amplified by PCR and analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel.Isolation of Cell Nuclei—Approximately 107 cells were washed 3 times with cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C and re-suspended in 1 ml of buffer A (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2) containing protease inhibitors (Sigma) and incubated on ice for 10 min. 100 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was then added, and cells were incubated for another 10 min on ice. Cells were lysed by passing through a 22-gauge needle 20 times. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 3000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min to precipitate the nuclei. Nuclei were washed 3 times in ice-cold buffer A and lysed in SDS lysis buffer for immunoblotting analysis.Immunoblotting Analysis—Primary human hepatocytes were treated with 10 nm insulin as described above. Total cell lysates or nuclei fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. An antibody against phospho-FoxO1 (Ser-256) (#9461; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) and antibodies against FoxO1 (sc-9462), HNF4α (sc-8987), and actin (sc-1615) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for Western blotting and detected by ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSEffect of Insulin on CYP7A1 and Transcription Factor mRNA Expression in Human Primary Hepatocytes—We first studied the effect of insulin on CYP7A1 mRNA expression in human primary hepatocytes using quantitative real-time PCR. Fig. 1A shows that increasing doses of insulin (0.1 nm to 100 nm) rapidly induced CYP7A1 mRNA levels in 2 h, with a maximum induction of ∼22-fold at the physiological concentration of 10 nm in this donor liver. Higher concentrations of insulin had less stimulatory effect on CYP7A1 mRNA expression. In contrast, insulin treatment for 6 h inhibited CYP7A1 mRNA by ∼40% at 100 nm (Fig. 1B). As a positive control, insulin strongly reduced PEPCK mRNA expression in primary hepatocytes at both 2 and 6 h (Fig. 1, A and B). To further study the insulin effect on CYP7A1 mRNA expression, we treated primary hepatocytes with insulin (10 nm) for a period of time from 2 to 24 h. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of primary hepatocytes from five donors showed that insulin induced CYP7A1 mRNA expression levels at 2 h by an average of ∼9-fold and inhibited CYP7A1 mRNA at 6 and 24 h by ∼36 and ∼39%, respectively (supplemental Table 1). As a positive control, insulin strongly inhibited PEPCK mRNA in a time-dependent manner.We also measured the mRNA expression levels of HNF4α, the key regulator of human CYP7A1 gene transcription, and SREBP-1c and FoxO1, two transcription factors that are known to mediate the effects of insulin (Table 1, supplemental data). Insulin significantly induced HNF4α mRNA levels at 2 h by ∼30% but inhibited it at 6 and 24 h. On the other hand, insulin induced SREBP-1c by about 2-fold, consistent with a previous report (30Cagen L.M. Deng X. Wilcox H.G. Park E.A. Raghow R. Elam M.B. Biochem. J. 2004; 385: 207-216Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Insulin had no effect on FoxO1 mRNA expression, consistent with previous studies that insulin regulates FoxO1 mainly at post-translational levels (15Puigserver P. Rhee J. Donovan J. Walkey C.J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 45276-45284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar).Identification of the IREs in the CYP7A1 Gene—FoxO1 is known to bind to the consensus IRE, T(G/A)TTT(T/G)(G/T), in the promoters of glucose-6-phosphatase, PEPCK, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1, and tyrosine aminotransferase and mediates the inhibitory effect of insulin on these genes (31O'Brien R.M. Noisin E.L. Suwanichkul A. Yamasaki T. Lucas P.C. Wang J.C. Powell D.R. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the nucleotide sequences in the CYP7A1 promoter identified four putative IREs in the rat gene and two putative IREs in the human gene (Fig. 2A). Only the IRE located in the bile acid response element-I (–81 to –75) is conserved in rat and human CYP7A1 genes. We then performed an EMSA to test if FoxO1 bound to these IREs in the CYP7A1 gene. Fig. 2B shows that FoxO1 bound strongly to the rat IRE2 (rIRE2) but did not bind to rIRE1, rIRE3, rIRE4, human (h) IRE1 and hIRE2 despite the similarity in nucleotide sequences (Fig. 2A). FoxO1 binding to rIRE2 was competed out by a large excess of unlabeled rIRE2 probe and a glucose-6-phosphatase probe that contained three FoxO1 binding sites (Fig. 2C) (16Nakae J. Kitamura T. Silver D.L. Accili D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). This rIRE2 also bound FoxA1 (HNF3α) as expected. A single mutation of G to T in the rIRE2 abolished Foxo1 binding (Fig. 2C). To test the effect of FoxO1 on rat CYP7A1 gene transcription, reporter assays were performed in HepG2 cells with a rat CYP7A1 promoter/luciferase construct. Co-transfection of a FoxO1 expression plasmid stimulated rat CYP7A1 reporter activity by ∼4-fold (Fig. 2D, left panel). When a single mutation that abolished FoxO1 binding was introduced into the rat CYP7A1 reporter, the basal reporter activity was reduced by more than 80%. Co-transfection of FoxO1 failed to stimulate the mutant reporter activity (Fig. 2D, left panel). This mutant reporter did respond to HNF4α and LXRα because it retained the HNF4α and LXRα binding sites as in the wild type plasmid (Fig. 2D, right panel).FIGURE 2EMSA of FoxO1 and FoxA1 interaction with the putative rat and human IREs.

In contrast to the stimulatory effect on the rat CYP7A1 reporter, co-transfection of FoxO1 inhibited human CYP7A1 reporter activities of ph-1887/Luc, ph-371/Luc, and ph-150/Luc by ∼70% (Fig. 3A). Further deletion of the sequence downstream of –150 abolished the inhibitory effect of FoxO1. Thus, the inhibitory effect of FoxO1 required the region from –150 to –135, which was previously mapped as the bile acid response element-II that contained an HNF4α binding site (32Stroup D. Chiang J.Y. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that FoxO1 interacts with the DNA binding domain of HNF4α and inhibits HNF4α trans-activation activity and its DNA binding (21Hirota K. Daitoku H. Matsuzaki H. Araya N.

To test if the HNF4α binding site was involved in FoxO1 regulation of the human CYP7A1 gene, the HNF4α binding site in the ph-1887/Luc reporter was mutated. Fig. 3B shows that the HNF4α binding site mutant reporter (mHNF4α-ph-1887/luc) had a much lower basal activity, and FoxO1 did not inhibit the mutant reporter activity. These results suggest that FoxO1 might inhibit human CYP7A1 gene by inhibiting HNF4α trans-activation activity. A mammalian one-hybrid assay was used to study the effect of FoxO1 on HNF4α trans-activation of a Gal4 (5×UAS)/TK/Luc reporter. Fig. 3C shows that Gal4-HNF4α activation of the GAL4 reporter activity was drastically increased by PGC-1α, and FoxO1 dose-dependently inhibited reporter activity (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that in addition to interfering with HNF4α bindi"

Previous studies suggested that Gremlin, a member of DAN family proteins, antagonizes BMP4 activity by sequestering extracellular BMP4. Herein, we report a novel intracellular regulatory mechanism by which Gremlin interacts with BMP4 precursor, prevents secretion of mature BMP4, and therefore inhibits BMP4 activity more efficiently. Furthermore, we also defined a 30-amino acid peptide sequence within the Gremlin DAN domain that is essential for BMP4 interaction. This novel Gremlin-mediated BMP4 posttranslational regulatory mechanism implies that the level of BMP4 mRNA expression does not truly reflect BMP4 activity when Gremlin and BMP4 are coexpressed within the same cell.

Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar), which plays an important role in many organ developmental processes including the basic body plan formation, the proximal-distal, left-right, and dorsal-ventral axes (2Hogan B.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). BMP4 elicits different biological responses depending upon the concentration of the secreted active form. For example, at early embryonic stages, cells exposed to high concentrations of BMP4 will commit to a ventral fate, while cells exposed to low concentrations of active BMP4 will develop into dorsal neural and muscular tissues (3De Robertis E.M. Kuroda H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 285-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 4Kishigami S. Mishina Y. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Therefore, controlling both expression and activation of BMP4 is critical for BMP4-mediated cell fate decision. The expression and activity of BMP4 can be regulated at multiple molecular levels, including transcriptional and post-translational regulation. At the protein level, BMP4 is initially synthesized as an inactive 50-kDa precursor protein within cells. Dimerization of the BMP4 precursor protein occurs by forming an intermolecular disulfide bond. Then, following proteolytic cleavage by members of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase family, an active carboxyl-terminal mature BMP4 protein dimer (25 kDa for the monomer) is produced, which is then secreted outside the cell to act as a growth factor (5Hammonds Jr., R.G.

Furthermore, the secreted active BMP4 can also be inhibited at the extracellular level by interacting with secreted BMP4 antagonists, such as noggin, chordin, Cer1, DAN, and Gremlin (8Balemans W. Van Hul W. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 231-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yanagita M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 10Piccolo S. Agius E.

Cell. 1996; 86: 589-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Gremlin was originally identified as a molecule capable of inducing secondary axis formation in the Xenopus embryo (12Hsu D.R. Economides A.N. Wang X. Eimon P.M. Harland R.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 673-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 13Pearce J.J. Penny G. Rossant J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 98-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Recombinant Gremlin protein is known to bind mature BMP2/4 in vitro and inhibits these BMP activities. A high level of Gremlin expression is found in nondividing and terminally differentiated cells such as neuron, alveolar epithelial cells, and goblet cells (14Topol L.Z. Marx M. Laugier D. Bogdanova N.N. Boubnov N.V. Clausen P.A. Calothy G. Blair D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4801-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The phenotypes of mice with Gremlin null mutation have shown that Gremlin plays an essential role in limb, lung, and kidney development, possibly due to inappropriate BMP signaling during the respective organ development (15Khokha M.K. Hsu D. Brunet L.J. Dionne M.S. Harland R.M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 16Michos O. Panman L. Vintersten K. Beier K. Zeller R. Zuniga A. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 3401-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of Gremlin-BMP4 interaction remains largely unexplored. Herein, we have found that Gremlin can specifically bind to BMP4 precursor protein inside cells, which prevents the production and secretion of mature BMP4 protein and thus down-regulates BMP4 ligand signaling in a most efficient manner. Thus, Gremlin functions as a highly efficient intracellular BMP4 antagonist, in addition to its classical extracellular antagonistic effect. Moreover, we have also mapped the protein sequences in Gremlin that mediate BMP4-Gremlin interaction. Antibodies and Reagents—The antibodies to BMP4, Gremlin, TGN38, and c-Myc epitope-tag antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-HA epitope-tag antibody was purchased from Covalence. Alexa Fluor 594- or 488-labeled anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, and anti-goat secondary antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen. Human recombinant BMP4 was from R&D Systems. Short peptides corresponding to the amino acid sequence of mouse Gremlin 37-52 (DKAQHNDSEQTQSPPQ) and 146-175 (PKKFTTMMVTLNCPELQPPTKKKRVTRVKQ) were synthesized by Genscript (Scotch Plains, NJ). Plasmid Constructs—Myc-tagged mouse BMP4 cDNA (Myc-BMP4) and HA-tagged mouse Gremlin cDNA (GRE-HA), as generated previously (7Constam D.B. Robertson E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), were subcloned into pcDNA3 expression vector. The Myc epitope was inserted into the carboxyl-terminal immediately adjacent to the cleavage site of mature BMP4, so that both precursor and mature forms of exogenously expressed BMP4 can be detected by Myc epitope. Partial cDNA of mouse Mucin-2, which encodes a Mucin-2 protein fragment of 114 amino acids on the carboxyl terminus (PQNQ... LGRK, GenBank™ accession number XP_620590), was generated by high fidelity RT-PCR (Pfu, Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing. An HA epitope was also added to the carboxyl terminus of Mucin-2 by inverted PCR. Partial deletions of Gremlin and a variety of Gremlin-Mucin-2 chimeric cDNA constructs were created by inverted PCR in combination with restricted digestion and ligation of PCR products. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—COS-1 and C2C12 cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Plasmid DNAs were transfected into the cells with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). The transfected cells were first cultured in the medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 20 h and then cultured in serum-free conditioned medium (CM) for additional 48 h prior to analysis. Experiments were repeated at least three times. Western Blot and Protein Co-immunoprecipitation—Equal amounts of total cell lysate protein or CM from different samples were separated in NuPAGE 4 -12% gradient SDS-PAGE gels using a MOP buffering system (Invitrogen). After protein was transferred into polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, proteins of interest were detected by specific antibodies. Proteins in different subcellular compartments were fractionated using the Proteo-Extract subcellular proteome extraction kit (Calbiochem). The fractionation of cytosolic, membrane/organelle, and nucleic proteins has been confirmed as reported (17Abdolzade-Bavil A. Hayes S. Goretzki L. Kroger M. Anders J. Hendriks R. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 1397-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed at 4 °C in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Lysates were cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation, followed by incubation with Protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The supernatants of cell lysates were then incubated with HA-specific antibody for 1 h, followed by further incubation with Protein A/G-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. The precipitated protein complexes were examined by Western blot. Immunostaining—Co-immunofluorescence staining of endogenous BMP4 and Gremlin was performed in E14.5 embryonic mouse lung using rabbit anti-Gremlin and goat antiBMP4 antibodies. Co-localization of exogenously expressed Myc-BMP4 and GRE-HA in cultured cells was detected by Myc and HA epitope co-immunofluorescence staining under a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope with 400X optical magnification and 4× digital zoom. Measurement of BMP4 Activity—BMP-stimulated mouse myoblast C2C12 cell differentiation into osteoblast cells was used to measure BMP4 activity. Briefly, C2C12 cells were grown in 96-well plate until 90% confluence. Agents (BMP4 or conditioned medium) were then added into the culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum), and the cells were cultured for another 3 days. The cells were then lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100, and the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in the cell lysate was quantified by adding substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate and measuring A405. Triplicate measurements were always performed for each sample. For BMP4 inhibitory assay by Gremlin peptides, the culture medium containing BMP4 (100 ng/ml) was preincubated with the related peptide at a concentration of 0.5 μm for 3 h at 37 °C before added into C2C12 cells. BMP4 Precursor Interacts with Gremlin Intracellularly in Mouse Embryonic Lung—BMP4 gradient formation in tissue is thought to be determined by extracellular interaction between BMP4 and related antagonists. However, for cells that coexpress BMP4 and BMP antagonists, intracellular interaction between BMP4 and BMP antagonists cannot be excluded. To determine the interaction between Gremlin and BMP4, the endogenous protein expression patterns of these two molecules were first compared in developing lung, where both BMP4 and Gremlin play important roles in its organogenesis (15Khokha M.K. Hsu D. Brunet L.J. Dionne M.S. Harland R.M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 16Michos O. Panman L. Vintersten K. Beier K. Zeller R. Zuniga A. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 3401-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). By co-immunofluorescence staining, Gremlin and BMP4 exhibited a partially overlapping epithelial expression pattern in E14.5 mouse embryonic lung (Fig. 1A), suggesting the possibility that these two proteins could interact intracellularly. Therefore, physical interaction of endogenous Gremlin and BMP4 precursor inside cells was examined by co-immunoprecipitation in mouse fetal tissue lysate. As shown in Fig. 1B, a precursor form of BMP4 (50 kDa) was specifically co-immunoprecipitated with Gremlin protein in fetal mouse lung tissue lysate, but not in kidney tissue, which suggested that tissue specific intracellular interaction between Gremlin and BMP4 precursor can occur in vivo. The biological significance of intracellular Gremlin-BMP4 precursor protein interaction and related molecular mechanisms were then further analyzed in cultured cells. Intracellular Interaction of Gremlin-BMP4 Precursor Inhibits BMP4 Activity Most Efficiently—Intracellular interaction of BMP4 and Gremlin was further studied by coexpression of these proteins in cultured C2C12 cells. Both HA epitope-tagged Gremlin (GRE-HA) and Myc-epitope tagged BMP4 (Myc-BMP4) were co-localized in the cytoplasm of co-transfected cells, as shown by co-immunofluorescence staining under a confocal microscope (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, expressed Myc-BMP4 or GRE-HA was also co-localized with TGN38, a marker for the trans-Golgi network (18Ghosh R.N. Mallet W.G. Soe T.T. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 923-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), suggesting that both proteins are trafficking through the same intracellular compartments (Fig. 2B-2C). The subcellular localizations of Myc-BMP4 and GRE-HA were also verified by Western blot detection in fractionated cell lysates (Fig. 2D). Expression of both Myc-BMP4 and GRE-HA was detected in the membrane/organelle protein extract fraction (including endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi) but not in the cytosolic and nucleic protein extract fractions. The physical interaction between BMP4 and Gremlin proteins in co-transfected COS-1 cells was then examined by protein co-immunoprecipitation. Myc-BMP4 precursor in cell lysate, but not mature Myc-BMP4 protein in conditioned medium (CM), was co-immunoprecipitated with GRE-HA (Fig. 2E). The activity of BMP4 secreted into CM was then measured by its effect on myoblast C2C12 cell differentiation into osteoblasts (Fig. 2F), in which characteristic ALP is expressed and the ALP level reflects BMP4 activity. The BMP4 activity in the CM of Myc-BMP4 transfected cells was inhibited by 20 ± 9% when an equal amount of CM collected from GRE-HA transfected cells was added. Interestingly, the CM collected from mixed cells that had been transfected separately by either Myc-BMP4 or GRE-HA exhibited a higher BMP4 inhibitory effect (55 ± 5%), possibly due to prolonged interaction between BMP4 and Gremlin in the CM. However, BMP4 activity in the CM from cells co-transfected with equal amounts of both GRE-HA and Myc-BMP4 was even more markedly inhibited (86 ± 4%, p < 0.05), suggesting a more efficient inhibitory effect of intracellular Gremlin-BMP4 interaction than extracellular antagonistic effect (Fig. 2F). Intracellular Gremlin-BMP4 Precursor Interaction Prevents Mature BMP4 Secretion—The precursor and mature forms of BMP4 protein in transfected cell lysates and CM were further analyzed. Consistent with previous reports (7Constam D.B. Robertson E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), no mature BMP4 was detected in the cell lysate, whereas mature but no precursor BMP4 was detected in concentrated CM (Fig. 3A). Most interestingly, reduced amounts of secreted mature BMP4 protein in CM were detected in inverse proportion to intracellular Gremlin expression (Fig. 3A). Therefore, lack of mature BMP4 in the CM of co-transfected cells may explain that no mature BMP4 was co-immunoprecipitated with Gremlin, as shown above in Fig. 2E. The level of BMP4 precursor in cell lysate was not significantly increased, even though BMP4 secretion was reduced, suggesting that BMP4-Gremlin complex may subject to facilitated degradation to maintain the same level of BMP4 precursor pool inside cell. Furthermore, both secreted forms of Gremlin and mature Myc-BMP4 in CM were dramatically increased when coexpressed Gremlin was mutated to lose its BMP4 binding activity (Gre-Muc-HA, see below for details), while the level of mutated Gremlin was low in cell lysate. These data suggest that intracellular interaction of Myc-BMP4 precursor and GRE-HA may prevent Myc-BMP4 precursor processing and mature Myc-BMP4 secretion. The net BMP4 activities in the above CM were also quantified by the BMP-stimulated C2C12 cell differentiation assay (Fig. 3B). The alterations of BMP4 activities in the CM were consistent with changes in secreted BMP4 mature protein levels as detected by Western blot in Fig. 3A. Moreover, transient Myc-BMP4 gene expression at the mRNA level remained similar in all samples with different levels of GRE-HA expression (Fig. 3C), as verified by quantitative real-time PCR using a Myc-tag specific primer and a protocol published previously (19Shi W. Chen H. Sun J. Buckley S. Zhao J. Anderson K.D. Williams R.G. Warburton D. Dev. Biol. 2003; 261: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This excludes the possibility that changes in mature Myc-BMP4 in the CM are due to differences in BMP4 gene expression. Gremlin DAN Domain Is Essential to Mediate Gremlin-BMP4 Interaction—The activity of BMP4 is thought to be precisely regulated extracellularly by many molecules defined as BMP antagonists (9Yanagita M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), which have a cystine-knot structure similar to BMPs themselves. DAN family proteins are one sub-group of BMP antagonists with a conserved eight-cystine membered knot structure on their carboxyl terminus, which distinguish them from other BMP antagonists with a nine or 10-membered cystine ring (20Avsian-Kretchmer O. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The DAN family includes Gremlin (14Topol L.Z. Marx M. Laugier D. Bogdanova N.N. Boubnov N.V. Clausen P.A.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6267-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), which are able to directly interact with BMPs and prevent BMPs from binding to their receptors. However, the molecular mechanisms of their protein interaction have never been explored. To further determine the specificity of BMP4-Gremlin binding and the molecular motif in Gremlin that is responsible for this intermolecular interaction, two Gremlin mutant molecules, GRE-DAN-HA and GRE-NF-HA, were generated with truncation of the NH2-terminal fragment or the carboxyl-terminal DAN domain, respectively (Fig. 4). Removal of the DAN domain from the Gremlin molecule (GRE-NF-HA) fully abolished its BMP4 binding ability and resulted in rapid and increased secretion of this truncated Gremlin molecule into the CM. In contrast, deletion of the N-terminal fragment of Gremlin did not have any impact on its BMP4 binding ability. Most of the GRE-HA and GRE-DAN-HA proteins with BMP binding activity were retained in the cell lysates. This suggests that the DAN domain in Gremlin is essential for BMP4 binding and that intracellular BMP4 precursor-Gremlin protein complex is not secreted outside the cell. Mapping the BMP4 Binding Motif of Gremlin DAN Domain—Not all the proteins with a highly conserved eight-membered Cys-knot DAN domain homology are able to bind to BMP4 or other BMPs. One of these proteins is Mucin-2 (Fig. 5A). Replacement of the Gremlin DAN domain with the corresponding Mucin-2 DAN domain sequence fully eliminated both its BMP4 binding activity and its BMP4 inhibitory function (GRE-Muc-HA in Figs.3&5, B-D). To further determine the protein sequence motif of Gremlin DAN domain that is responsible for BMP4 interaction, we made a variety of Gremlin-Mucin-2 chimeras within the DAN domain region without changing its Cys-knot structure (Fig. 5B). These Gremlin-Mucin-2 chimeric proteins were coexpressed with Myc-BMP4 in COS-1 cells by transient transfection. The related BMP4 binding and inhibitory activities were evaluated by co-immunoprecipitation and BMP4-stimulated C2C12 cell differentiation assay. Thus, a 30-amino acid region corresponding to Gremlin amino acid sequence 145-174 (PKKFTTMMVTLNCPELQPPTKKKRVTR-VKQ) appears essential to mediate the interaction between Gremlin and BMP4 and its BMP4 inhibitory effect (Fig. 5, B-D). Next, the function of this molecular motif in mediating the interaction between Gremlin and mature BMP4, which is the mechanism of Gremlin antagonistic effect on active BMP4, was tested in the BMP4-induced C2C12 cell differentiation assay. Interestingly, preincubation of active BMP4 (100 ng/ml) with a synthesized linear peptide corresponding to the mapped amino acid sequences (145-174, 0.5 μm) significantly inhibited BMP4 activity by 56 ± 10% (p < 0.05, Fig. 5E), similar to the BMP4 inhibitory effect obtained by preincubation with full-length Gremlin in the CM (35 ± 3% inhibition in Fig. 5E). Meanwhile, a control peptide with the amino acid sequence of Gremlin NH2-terminal fragment (37-52) at the same concentration (0.5 μm) did not display any inhibitory effect on BMP4 signaling activity. An approximate structure of mouse Gremlin DAN domain (amino acid 94 -184; CKTQP... SIDLD) was then determined with respect to the published structure of human chorionic gonadotropin chain B by homology modeling using the program Modeler version 8.1 (Fig. 6; Refs. 27Wu H. Lustbader J.W. Liu Y. Canfield R.E. Hendrickson W.A. Structure (Lond.). 1994; 2: 545-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar and 28Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar). As previously delineated by Avsian-Kretchmer and Hsueh (20Avsian-Kretchmer O. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), human chorionic gonadotropin chain B is a good homology modeling template for Gremlin because they both share cystine knots that form eight-membered rings and have “fingers” of similar size. The mapped 30-amino acid region (145-174) spans across a whole finger structure (finger 2), which provides a surface that is independent of the rest of the molecule. In addition, the most dominant feature of finger 2 in Gremlin DAN domain appears to be the positively charged lysine and arginine residue side chains spread across the surface, suggesting that this positively charged surface might bind to the negatively charged patch (residues of aspartic acid and glutamic acid) that has been observed on carboxyl-terminal BMP2/4. Our studies indicate that inhibition of BMP4 activity can be achieved either by intracellular interaction with Gremlin when coexpressed in the same cells or by an extracellular antagonistic mechanism if Gremlin is expressed in different cells. The intracellular interaction and subsequent inhibition of BMP4 secretion by Gremlin may provide an efficient and fine regulatory mechanism to direct different cellular fates by changing autocrine/paracrine activity in neighboring cells within a small microenvironment or may provide a negative feed back mechanism for certain cells. The intracellular interaction between Gremlin and BMP4 appeared to be tissue-specific, as detected in embryonic lung, but not in embryonic kidney. Thus, Gremlin and BMP4 may not coexpress in the same cells in kidney at this specific stage. Alternatively, BMP family members other than BMP4 may bind to Gremlin in kidney, or BMP antagonists other than DAN family proteins, such as CRIM1 (29Wilkinson L. Kolle G. Wen D. Piper M. Scott J. Little M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34181-34188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), may be the major players in regulating BMP signaling activity in kidney and other tissues. As reported previously, cleavage of BMP4 precursor into the mature form of BMP4 occurs in the trans-Golgi network (7Constam D.B. Robertson E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation of Gremlin with the precursor form of BMP4 in cells co-transfected with Gremlin and BMP4 suggests that the intracellular protein interaction between BMP4 and Gremlin occurs in the subcellular compartments before these proteins enter the trans-Golgi network during the secretion process (co-translational or endoplasmic reticulum sites). Binding of Gremlin appears to affect the processing of precursor to mature BMP4 in cells and subsequently inhibit BMP4 secretion. This could be a most efficient and rapid way to down-regulate BMP4-mediated signal activity in cells. However, the exact physiological roles of this intracellular Gremlin regulatory function versus extracellular antagonistic function in vivo needs to be further investigated. The intracellular inhibition of BMP4 by Gremlin interaction also implies that measurement of BMP4 ligand mRNA expression level alone by RT-PCR and/or in situ hybridization, which are commonly used to evaluate BMP4 activity in developmental biology studies, may not reflect the actual BMP4 activity, since that approach neglects the important posttranslational processing of the BMP4 precursor protein regulated by Gremlin. Whether this intracellular inhibitory effect of Gremlin is a common mechanism to all DAN family proteins remains to be determined. van Bezooijen et al. (30van Bezooijen R.L. Roelen B.A. Visser A. Wee-Pals L. de Wilt E. Karperien M. Hamersma H. Papapoulos S.E. Ten Dijke P. Lowik C.W. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar) reported that sclerosteosis resulting from a defective sclerostin did not occur via a classical BMP antagonistic mechanism, since addition of exogenous sclerostin into mouse C2C12 cell culture medium did not antagonize BMP-stimulated ALP activity. Based upon our data, an intracellular BMP inhibitory effect may well mediate the biological effect of sclerostin. This novel intracellular Gremlin-BMP4 precursor interaction may therefore help us to more precisely understand the regulation of BMP signaling mechanisms in physiological as well as pathological situations. By replacing Gremlin DAN domain with the corresponding Mucin-2 DAN domain protein sequences, the BMP4 binding and inhibitory activity of Gremlin is fully abolished, confirming the specificity of intracellular Gremlin-BMP4 interaction. Furthermore, a 30-amino acid peptide motif in Gremlin DAN domain was mapped by introducing a variety of mutations in the protein sequences of Gremlin DAN domain without disruption of the overall Cys-knot structure. From molecular modeling, we speculate that these 30-amino acid residues constitute an independent surface finger structure with multiple positively charged lysine and arginine residues, providing a docking site for negatively charged patch on BMP ligands. Thus, BMP4 inhibition by Gremlin-BMP4 interaction may be mediated by a mechanism that is different from other non-DAN family antagonist-mediated BMP inhibition, such as Noggin (31Groppe J. Greenwald J. Wiater E. Rodriguez-Leon J. Economides A.N. Kwiatkowski W. Affolter M. Vale W.W. Belmonte J.C. Choe S. Nature. 2002; 420: 636-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Noggin-BMP7 binding is mediated by hydrophobic interaction that masks the hydrophobic interface required for BMP receptor I and II binding (31Groppe J. Greenwald J. Wiater E. Rodriguez-Leon J. Economides A.N. Kwiatkowski W. Affolter M. Vale W.W. Belmonte J.C. Choe S. Nature. 2002; 420: 636-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 32Nickel J. Dreyer M.K. Kirsch T. Sebald W. J. Bone Joint Surg. Am. 2001; 83-A: S7-S14Google Scholar). Alternatively, Gremlin-BMP4 interaction could result in BMP4 conformational changes, which prevents BMP4 precursor cleavage and maturation within the cell, and reduces BMP4-receptor binding activity outside the cell. We thank Sue Buckley for critically reading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1991178857,"The clinical manifestations of West Nile virus (WNV), a member of the Flavivirus family, include febrile illness, sporadic encephalitis, and paralysis. The capsid (Cp) of WNV is thought to participate in these processes by inducing apoptosis through mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. To further identify the molecular mechanism of the WNV capsid protein (WNVCp), yeast two-hybrid assays were employed using WNV-Cp as bait. Jab1, the fifth subunit of the COP9 signalosome, was subsequently identified as a molecule that interacts with WNVCp. Immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays confirmed that direct interaction could occur between WNVCp and Jab1. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that the overexpressed WNVCp, which localized to the nucleolus, was translocated to the cytoplasm upon its co-expression with Jab1. When treated with leptomycin B, Jab1-facilitated nuclear exclusion of WNVCp was prevented, which indicated that the CRM1 complex is required for Jab1-facilitated nuclear export of WNVCp. Moreover, Jab1 promoted the degradation of WNVCp in a proteasome-dependent way. Consistent with this, WNVCp-mediated cell cycle arrest at the G2 phase in H1299 was prevented by exogenous Jab1. Finally, an analysis of WNVCp deletion mutants indicated that the first 15 amino acids were required for interaction with Jab1. Furthermore, the double-point mutant of the WNVCp, P5A/P8A, was incapable of binding to Jab1. These results indicate that Jab1 has a potential protective effect against pathogenic WNVCp and might provide a novel target site for the treatment of disease caused by WNV.

Jab1, the fifth subunit of the COP9 signalosome, was subsequently identified as a molecule that interacts with WNVCp. Immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays confirmed that direct interaction could occur between WNVCp and Jab1. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that the overexpressed WNVCp, which localized to the nucleolus, was translocated to the cytoplasm upon its co-expression with Jab1. When treated with leptomycin B, Jab1-facilitated nuclear exclusion of WNVCp was prevented, which indicated that the CRM1 complex is required for Jab1-facilitated nuclear export of WNVCp. Moreover, Jab1 promoted the degradation of WNVCp in a proteasome-dependent way. Consistent with this, WNVCp-mediated cell cycle arrest at the G2 phase in H1299 was prevented by exogenous Jab1. Finally, an analysis of WNVCp deletion mutants indicated that the first 15 amino acids were required for interaction with Jab1. Furthermore, the double-point mutant of the WNVCp, P5A/P8A, was incapable of binding to Jab1. These results indicate that Jab1 has a potential protective effect against pathogenic WNVCp and might provide a novel target site for the treatment of disease caused by WNV.

Other members of this genus include St. Louis Encephalitis virus, Kunjin virus, Dengue virus, and Murray Valley encephalitis virus (1Smithburn K.C. Hughes T.P. Burke A.W. Paul J.H. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1940; 20: 471-492Crossref Google Scholar). WNV was first isolated in 1937 from the West Nile Province of Uganda (1Smithburn K.C. Hughes T.P. Burke A.W. Paul J.H. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1940; 20: 471-492Crossref Google Scholar). WNV quickly became one of the most prevalent flaviviruses distributed in Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and the United States. Its clinical symptoms include febrile illness, fatal meningoencephalitis, and acute flaccid paralysis syndrome (2Sampson B.A. Ambrosi C. Carlot A. Reiber K. Veress J.F. Armbrustmacher V. Hum. Pathol. 2000; 31: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). WNV contains a single positive-sense RNA genome of ∼11 kb in length; this genome encodes polyprotein. This protein is processed by viral and cellular proteases to generate three structural proteins of the capsid (Cp), envelope, and premembrane, as well as seven nonstructural proteins, which are mainly involved in the process of replication. These seven nonstructural proteins include NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 (3Chambers T.J. Hahn C.S. Galler R. Rice C.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar, 4Westaway E.G. Brinton M.A. Gaidamovich S. Horzinek M.C. Igarashi A. Kaariainen L. Lvov D.K. Porterfield J.S. Russel P.K. Trent D.W. Flaviviridae Intervirology. 1985; 24: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The pathway of WNV infection is mediated through a clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway (5Chu J.J. Ng M.L. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 10543-10555Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). After replication subsequent to inoculation, WNV spreads to the lymph nodes and the bloodstream (6Diamond M.S. Shrestha B. Mehlhop E. Sitati E. Engle M. Viral. Immunol. 2003; 16: 259-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It then invades the central nervous system in a Toll-like and tumor necrosis factor receptor-dependent manner, which facilitates the infiltration of WNV across the blood-brain barrier (7Cheeran M.C. Hu S. Sheng W.S. Rashid A. Peterson P.K. Lokensgard J.R. J. Neurovirol. 2005; 11: 512-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 8Wang T. Town T. Alexopoulou L. Fikring E. Flavell R.A. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1366-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). WNV infection is known to trigger cell death through either a necrotic or an apoptotic pathway (5Chu J.J. Ng M.L. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 10543-10555Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 9Parquet M.C. Kumatori A. Hasebe F. Morita K. Igarashi A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Infection induces overexpression of Bax, followed by apoptotic cell death in the host cells (9Parquet M.C. Kumatori A. Hasebe F. Morita K. Igarashi A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, it has also been reported that a high level of viremia in WNV infection could lead to a necrotic pathway (10Chu J.J. Ng M.L. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 3305-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although the detailed mechanism involved in this process has not yet been defined clearly, several reports have suggested that molecules derived from the WNV genome are responsible for apoptosis. For example, the WNVCp protein was shown to mediate the activation of caspase-9; this activation may occur as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction (11Yang J.S. Ramanathan M.P. Muthumani K. Choo A.Y. Jin S.H. Yu Q.C. Hwang D.S. Choo D.K. Lee M.D. Dang K. Tang W. Kim J.J. Weiner D.B. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2002; 8: 1379-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Through the functional comparison of proteins NS2B-NS3 from other flaviviruses, WNV NS2B-NS3 was also shown to induce capase-8- and caspase-3-mediated apoptosis (12Ramanathan M.P. Chambers J.A. Pankhong P. Chattergoon M. Attatippaholkun W. Dang K. Shah N. Weiner D.B. Virology. 2006; 345: 56-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although the prevalence of WNV has increased globally and its serious clinical manifestations have prompted extensive research worldwide, the pathogenic mechanism of WNV in the central nervous system is not clearly understood at a molecular level, and further research is required to establish adequate options for both the treatment and prevention of WNV infection. Jab1 is the fifth of the COP9 signalosome (CSN) complex; the Arabidopsis homologs of the CSN complex are responsible for the photomorphogenic process (13Kwok S.F. Solano R. Tsuge T. Chamovitz D.A. Ecker J.R. Matsui M. Deng X.W. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1779-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The CSN complexes also share sequence and structural homologies with the 19 S proteasome lid and the eIF3 translation initiation complex (14Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W. Fried V.A. Finley D. Cell. 1998; 94: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, Jab1 seems to display a broad spectrum of regulatory activities through its mediation of the stabilization or destabilization of various proteins. It was first identified as a c-Jun-interacting protein that enhances AP-1 transcriptional activities (15Claret F.X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Jab1 also facilitates the 26 S proteasome-dependent degradation of several proteins, including p27Kip, LHR, p53, estrogen receptor, Smad4, Smad7, Id1, Id3, and topoisomerase IIα (16Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J.Y. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 17Li S. Liu X. Ascoli M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 31296-31303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the relationship between Jab1 and the 26 S proteasome complex during protein degradation is not yet clearly understood. It was recently reported that in cooperation with CSN, Jab1 mediates the deneddylation of the cullin component of SCF ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase, which may promote cullin-dependent proteolysis (24Cope G.A. Suh G.S. Aravind L. Schwarz S.E. Zipursky S.L. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). In this study, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening and found that Jab1 was capable of binding to WNVCp. The overexpressed WNVCp, which consistently localized to the nucleolus, was exported to the cytoplasm in the presence of Jab1. Jab1 subsequently induced the degradation of WNVCp in a proteasome-dependent manner. In accordance with these data, the cytotoxic effect of WNVCp, which induced cell cycle arrest at G2 phase in H1299, was prevented in the presence of Jab1. Plasmids—pGBK-T7-WNVCp, a bait plasmid for yeast two-hybrid screening, was created by cloning an EcoRI-XhoI fragment from pcDNA3-His-WNVCp into pGBK-T7 (Clontech). pGAD-T7-Jab1 was generated by subcloning an EcoRI-XhoI fragment from pGEX-4T-1-Jab1 (provided by K. W. Kim, National University of Seoul) into pGAD-T7 (Clontech). pcDNA3-HA-WNVCp and pET28a-His-WNVCp were prepared by subcloning an EcoRI-XhoI fragment from pcDNA3-his-WNVCp into pcDNA3-HA and pET28a-His (Invitrogen). pcDNA3-HA-WNVCp (P5A/P8A) and pET28a-His-WNVCp (P5A/P8A) were generated by PCR using pcDNA3-HA-WNVCp as a template and the following primer pairs: 5′-CCGAATTCATGTCTAAAAAACCAGGTGGCCCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTACGCGCCCACGCTGGCGATCAG-3′ (reverse). pcDNA3-HA-WNVCp deletion mutants, Δ1-15, Δ1-30, Δ1-60, Δ76-123, Δ91-123, and Δ106-123, were prepared by PCR using pcDNA3-HA-WNVCp as a template and the following primers: 5′-CGGAATTCATGCTGAAGCGCGGCATGCTG-3′ (forward, Δ1-15), 5′-CGGAATTCATGAAGCGCGCCATGCTGAGC-3′ (forward, Δ1-30), or 5′-CGGAATTCATGCCCACCCGCGCCGTGCTG-3′ (forward, Δ1-60) and 5′-ACGCGTCGACACTGCTTGTTCACGCCGCG-3′ (reverse, Δ76-123), 5′-ACGCGTCGACAGGTGCCCAGCTCCTTCTT-3′ (reverse, Δ91-123), or 5′-ACGCGTCGACAGCGCTTCTTCTGCTTGCT-3′ (reverse, Δ106-123). The PCR products were digested with EcoRI-XhoI and cloned into the corresponding sites of the pcDNA-3-HA or pET28a-His plasmids. pCS3-MT-BX (6xMyc)-Jab1 was generated by subcloning of the EcoRI-XhoI fragment into pCS3-MT-BX (6xMyc) (a generous gift from J. H. Ahn, Sungkyunkwan University). All constructs were confirmed by enzyme digestion and DNA sequence analyses. The levels of endogenous Jab1 were decreased by the use of Jab1 siRNA (5′-GCUCAGAGUAUCGAUGAAA-3′) oligonucleotides with 3′-dTdT overhangs, and were synthesized using Qiagen. Control siRNA in experiments refers to a mixture of scrambled siRNA oligonucleotides (Qiagen). The cells were transfected with 200 nm of siRNA by using Oligofectamine according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed with the pretransformed MATCHMAKER human brain cDNA library (Clontech), used according to the instructions of the manufacturer. In brief, pGBK-T7-WNVCp was transformed into yeast strain AH109. Transformants containing bait plasmid were mated with the pretransformed human brain cDNA library. Candidates for two-hybrid interaction were initially selected on SD medium (-His, -Leu, and -Trp) and further confirmed on SD medium (-Ade, -His, -Leu, and -Trp) containing X-gal. Plasmid DNA was isolated from the positive clones and sequenced according to the instructions of the manufacturer. To further confirm the interaction between WNVCp and Jab1, Y187, and AH109, each pair containing pGAD-T7-Jab1 and pGBK-T7-WNVCp, respectively, were mated and tested using SD medium (-Ade, -His, -Leu, and -Trp) containing X-gal. Cell Biology—Human cancer cell lines, H1299 (p53 null Lung carcinoma) and 293T (kidney carcinoma), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine plus reagent (Invitrogen) or Welfect (Wellgene) according to the recommendations of the manufacturers. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis were carried out as follows. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested in a lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100× protease inhibitor mixture). Whole cell extracts were incubated with the target antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. A/G beads (Roche Applied Science) were added to the lysates, incubated for 2 h at 4°C, precipitated, and washed three times in a lysis buffer. The bound proteins were dissolved in the sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The resolved proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences), blotted with the primary antibody, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase antirabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 1 h at 25 °C. Antibody binding was detected using an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Protein Purification and Pulldown Assay—GST and GST-Jab1 were prepared as described previously (25Akamatsu E. Tanaka T. Kato J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16494-16500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). His-WNVCp and His-P5A/P8A were prepared according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). In brief, BL21 cells, which has been transformed with pET28a-His-WNVCp or pET28a-His-P5A/P8A, were treated with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) at 25 °C. The crude extract was prepared using lysozyme (Sigma). The extract was resolved over a Resource Q (35 ml; Amersham Biosciences), His-bind resin (20 ml; Novagen), and DEAE column (50 ml; Amersham Biosciences). Fractions containing His-WNVCp or His-P5A/P8A were concentrated using a Centriprep-30 (Millipore). The pulldown experiment was carried out as described previously (26Bimston D. Song J. Winchester D. Takayama S. Reed J.C. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6871-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells were plated in 6-well plates with coverslips; transfections were performed using Lipofectamine reagent. After 24 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 15 min at room temperature, washed with PBS (Invitrogen), and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. The cells were then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in PBS for 30 min and incubated overnight with the specific primary antibody at room temperature. The samples were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse or Alexa 594 anti-rabbit antibodies (each diluted at 1:400) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) for 5 min. The slides were analyzed using confocal or immunofluorescence microscopes (Carl Zeiss Vision, LSM510 and 5203 Axiophot, respectively, Oberkochen). Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis—For fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, H1299 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-HA-WNVCp, pcDNA3-HA-P5A/P8A, or pcDNA3-HA-Δ106-123 with or without pCMV-FLAG-Jab1. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested using trypsin and subsequently fixed with 70% EtOH. After washing three times with PBS, the fixed cells were incubated with RNase A (1 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by treatment with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) for 30 min. Stained cells were detected by flow cytometry analysis (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using CellQuest Pro software (BD Biosciences). Jab1 Is Capable of Directly Binding to WNVCp and Promotes Its Nuclear Export—WNVCp is known to induce cell death through mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of caspase-9 in tissue culture (11Yang J.S. Ramanathan M.P. Muthumani K. Choo A.Y. Jin S.H. Yu Q.C. Hwang D.S. Choo D.K. Lee M.D. Dang K. Tang W. Kim J.J. Weiner D.B. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2002; 8: 1379-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). When its gene was delivered to mouse brain or skeletal muscle, it caused cell death and inflammation in vivo (11Yang J.S. Ramanathan M.P. Muthumani K. Choo A.Y. Jin S.H. Yu Q.C. Hwang D.S. Choo D.K. Lee M.D. Dang K. Tang W. Kim J.J. Weiner D.B. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2002; 8: 1379-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This observation led us to search for a factor that might be associated with WNVCp. To identify an interacting protein, we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay using the entire region of WNVCp as bait. Among the several proteins identified, yeast two-hybrid screening demonstrated the interaction of two Jab1 fragments with WNVCp (Fig. 1A). Co-immunoprecipitation and GST pulldown assays between the two purified proteins indicated that WNVCp was able to directly interact with Jab1 (Fig. 1, B and C). Interaction of the two proteins was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of ectopic WNVCp and endogenous Jab1 (Fig. 1D). WNVCp has been shown to localize to the nucleolus (11Yang J.S. Ramanathan M.P. Muthumani K. Choo A.Y. Jin S.H. Yu Q.C. Hwang D.S. Choo D.K. Lee M.D. Dang K. Tang W. Kim J.J. Weiner D.B. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2002; 8: 1379-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). As reported previously, the WNVCp, which had been transfected into H1299 (p53-null lung carcinoma) cells, mostly localized to the nucleolus. This was confirmed by its colocalization with nucleolin, the nucleolus protein (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, when WNVCp was cotransfected with Jab1, ∼45% of cells displayed WNVCp that had translocated to the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B, panels 5-8, and graph). Jab1 is known to participate in the translocation of various proteins, including p27Kip and Smad, through a CRM1-dependent pathway (16Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J.Y. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 20Wan M. Cao X. Wu Y. Bai S. Wu L. Shi X. Wang N. Cao X. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 21Kim B.C. Lee H.J. Park S.H. Lee S.R. Karpova T.S. McNally J.G. Felici A. Lee D.K. Kim S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2251-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To identify whether Jab1 could induce the translocation of WNVCp in a similar way, LMB, an inhibitor of CRM1 (27Fukuda M. Asno S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar), was administered to cells overexpressing Jab1 and WNVCp. The results of this investigation showed that LMB prevented Jab1-mediated cytoplasmic localization of WNVCp (Fig. 2B, panels 9-12, and graph). This indicates that Jab1 is capable of inducing nuclear exclusion of WNVCp to the cytoplasm, rather than inhibiting the localization of WNVCp to the nucleus from the cytoplasm. Overall, the data indicated that Jab1 directly interacted with WNVCp, which could induce its nuclear exclusion in a CRM1-dependent manner. The N-terminal Domain of WNVCp Is Responsible for Its Interaction with Jab1—Next, we analyzed the WNVCp domain, which might be responsible for its localization to the nucleolus and interaction with Jab1. We constructed serial deletion mutants of WNVCp, as depicted schematically in Fig. 3. The N-terminal deletion mutants, Δ1-15, Δ1-30, and Δ1-60, and the C-terminal deletion mutant, Δ106-123, were all localized to the nucleolus (Fig. 3, panels 1-10). However, Δ91-123 and Δ76-123 were localized to the cytoplasm, which implies that the nuclear localization signal (NLS) might be located between the amino acid residues 90 and 105 (Fig. 3, panels 11-14, and Fig. 9C).FIGURE 9Jab1 negatively regulates the WNVCp-induced, but not P5A/P8A-induced, cell cycle arrest at G2 phase in H1299 cells. A, H1299 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing HA-WNVCp, HA-P5A/P8A, and HA-Δ106-123 with or without FLAG-Jab1. After harvesting, cells were fixed and stained with EtOH and propidium iodide (PI), respectively. Stained cells were detected by flow cytometry analysis and analyzed using CellQuest Pro software. B, H1299 cells were transfected with either the control siRNA or Jab1 siRNA oligonucleotides. After 48 h, cells were transfected with the plasmid expressing HA-WNVCp. After harvesting, cells were fixed and stained with EtOH and propidium iodide (PI), respectively, and were detected as described above. C, the domains of WNVCp showing a Jab1-interacting motif (black), nucleus-localizing signal (NLS, striped), and region required for WNVCp degradation and cell cycle arrest (gray).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effects of Jab1 on the localization of the deletion mutants were further tested using immunofluorescence microscopy. Although the localization of Δ1-15, Δ1-30, and Δ1-60 was not affected in the presence of exogenous Jab1, Δ106-123 was exported to the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, panels 5-12, and data not shown). These data indicated that the putative Jab1-binding region of WNVCp might reside on the first 15 amino acids at its N terminus (Fig. 9C). Because Jab1-binding proteins are known to contain a conserved motif that is responsible for their interactions with Jab1, we compared the first 15 amino acids of the WNVCp N terminus with the other Jab1-binding motif, which is found in both p53 and p27Kip (18Bech-Otschir D. Kraft R. Huang X. Henklein P. Kapelari B. Pollmann C. Dubiel W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1630-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 28Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Arata Y. Mori S. Maeda M. Tanaka D. Yoshida M. Yoneda-Kato N. Kato J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2302-2310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The comparison clearly indicates the presence of PXXP sequences within the proteins that were being compared (Fig. 5A). This observation prompted us to substitute the prolines on the 5th and 8th residues of the WNVCp with alanines. Interestingly, the point mutant, P5A/P8A, was not translocated into the cytoplasm by Jab1, which suggested that this mutant might be defective in its interaction with Jab1 (Fig. 5B, panels 5-8).FIGURE 5Jab1-facilitated nuclear exclusion of WNVCp requires the presence of PXXP sequences at the N terminus of WNVCp. A, alignment of the N-terminal protein sequences of WNVCp with the p53 and p27 motifs necessary for their Jab1 interaction. Dark gray and light gray shading indicate identical and similar residues, respectively. B, H1299 cells were transfected with plasmid expressing HA-P5A/P8A alone or HA-P5A/P8A and HA-WNVCP with Myc-Jab1 and stained as described in Fig. 2B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We performed co-immunoprecipitation or GST pulldown assays to elucidate whether P5A/P8A and Δ106-123 were able to directly interact with Jab1. In accordance with the immunofluorescence data depicted in Figs. 4 and 5, the immunoprecipitation assays showed that Δ106-123, but not P5A/P8A, was able to interact with Jab1 (Fig. 6A). When GST pulldown assays were performed using purified His-P5A/P8A, His-WNVCp, and GST-Jab1, only His-WNVCp bound to Jab1 (Fig. 6B, lanes 4-7). This finding suggests that this point mutant is deficient in its ability to bind to Jab1. Taken together, through deletion and point mutant analyses, we found that the N terminus of WNVCp is responsible for its Jab1 binding. Furthermore, the NLS seems to localize between amino acids 90 and 105. Jab1 Induces the Proteasome-dependent Degradation of WNVCp—It was reported that Jab1-mediated nuclear export of substrates such as p53 and p27 is correlated with their degradation (28Tomoda K.

To test whether WNVCp nuclear export by Jab1 also leads to degradation, we treated cells overexpressing Jab1 and WNVCp with or without MG132 and assessed them using immunofluorescence and degradation assays. In the absence of MG132, we were able to observe the dispersion of WNVCp in the cytoplasm, as well as in the nucleus, in the presence of Jab1 (Fig. 7, panels 1-8). On the other hand, in the absence of Jab1, WNVCp remained in the nucleoli (Fig. 7, panels 9-11). Similar to these results, in the presence of MG132, WNVCp localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 7, panels 12-19). However, unlike the cytoplasmic WNVCp distribution in the absence of MG132, we observed that the amount of WNVCp that accumulated in the cytoplasm was significantly increased (Fig. 7, panels 12-19). Interestingly, the co-localization of Jab1 with WNVCp was more obvious in the presence of MG132. It seems that the prevention of WNVCp degradation by MG132 led to the formation of more complexes between WNVCp and Jab1. Taken together, these data show that the localization of WNVCp is correlated with the nuclear export pathway. The degradation of WNVCp was further confirmed by measuring the levels of WNVCp in the presence or absence of Jab1. When Jab1 and WNVCp were co-transfected, we observed a 60% decrease in overexpressed WNVCp (Fig. 8A, lanes 1 and 2). The decreased levels of WNVCp in the presence of Jab1 were recovered when cells were treated with a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, which suggested that Jab1 facilitated the proteasome-dependent degradation of WNVCp (Fig. 8A, lanes 3 and 4). To identify whether the degradation of WNVCp correlates with its Jab1-dependent nuclear export, treatment with LMB was used to prevent the nuclear export of WNVCp, as shown in Fig. 2 (Fig. 8A, lanes 5 and 6). The result indicated that LMB treatment completely blocked Jab1-mediated degradation of WNVCp, which suggested that nuclear export and degradation are related processes. Degradation assays using HA-P5A/P8A and HA-Δ106-123 as substrates showed that both mutants were resistant to Jab1-facilitated proteasome-dependent degradation (Fig. 8B, lanes 1-4). Because P5A/P8A did not bind to Jab1, it appears that Jab1 might function as a mediator that introduces WNVCp bound to Jab1 to the 26 S proteasome complexes (16Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J.Y.

In this study, three heparin-derived oligosaccharides of different lengths were co-crystallized with annexin A2 to elucidate the structural basis of the interaction. Crystal structures were obtained at high resolution for uncomplexed annexin A2 and three complexes of heparin oligosaccharides bound to annexin A2. The common heparin-binding site is situated at the convex face of domain IV of annexin A2. At this site, annexin A2 binds up to five sugar residues from the nonreducing end of the oligosaccharide. Unlike most heparin-binding consensus patterns, heparin binding at this site does not rely on arrays of basic residues; instead, main-chain and side-chain nitrogen atoms and two calcium ions play important roles in the binding. Especially significant is a novel calcium-binding site that forms upon heparin binding. Two sugar residues of the heparin derivatives provide oxygen ligands for this calcium ion. Comparison of all four structures shows that heparin binding does not elicit a significant conformational change in annexin A2. Finally, surface plasmon resonance measurements were made for binding interactions between annexin A2 and heparin polysaccharide in solution at pH 7.4 or 5.0. The combined data provide a clear basis for the calcium dependence of heparin binding to annexin A2."
https://openalex.org/W2057175286,"Dysregulation of apoptosis in endothelial cells (EC) and fibroblasts contributes to fibrosis. We have shown previously that apoptosis of EC triggers the proteolysis of extracellular matrix components and the release of a C-terminal fragment of perlecan, which in turn inhibits apoptosis of fibroblasts. Here we have defined the receptors and pathways implicated in this anti-apoptotic response in fibroblasts. Neutralizing α2β1 integrin activity in fibroblasts exposed to either medium conditioned by apoptotic EC (SSC) or a recombinant perlecan C-terminal fragment (LG3) prevented resistance to apoptosis and is associated with decreased levels of Akt phosphorylation. Co-incubation of fibroblasts for 24 h with SSC or LG3 in the presence of PP2 (AG1879), a biochemical inhibitor of Src family kinases (SFKs) and focal adhesion kinase, showed a significantly decreased anti-apoptotic response. However, focal adhesion kinase gene silencing with RNA interference did not inhibit the anti-apoptotic response in fibroblasts. Src phosphorylation was increased in fibroblasts exposed to SSC, and transfection of fibroblasts with constitutively active Src mutants induced an anti-apoptotic response that was not further increased by SSC. Also, Src<sup>–/–</sup>Fyn<sup>–/–</sup> fibroblasts failed to mount an anti-apoptotic response in presence of SSC for 24 h but developed a complete anti-apoptotic response when exposed to SSC for 7 days. These results suggest that extracellular matrix fragments produced by apoptotic EC initiate a state of resistance to apoptosis in fibroblasts via an α2β1 integrin/SFK (Src and Fyn)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent pathway. In the long term, additional SFK members are recruited for sustaining the anti-apoptotic response, which could play crucial roles in abnormal fibrogenic healing."

Because these metabolic pathways contain multiple iron-sulfur (FeS) proteins, their synthesis, including the formation of FeS clusters, is required. However, nothing is known about FeS cluster biogenesis in trypanosomes, organisms that are evolutionarily distant from yeast and humans. Here we demonstrate that two mitochondrial proteins, the cysteine desulfurase TbiscS and the metallochaperone TbiscU, are functionally conserved in trypanosomes and essential for this parasite. Knock-downs of TbiscS and TbiscU in the procyclic stage by means of RNA interference resulted in reduced activity of the marker FeS enzyme aconitase in both the mitochondrion and cytosol because of the lack of FeS clusters. Moreover, down-regulation of TbiscS and TbiscU affected the metabolism of procyclic T. brucei so that their mitochondria resembled the organelle of the bloodstream stage; mitochondrial ATP production was impaired, the activity of the respiratory chain protein complex ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase was reduced, and the production of pyruvate as an end product of glucose metabolism was enhanced.

Microbiol. 2004; 7: 362-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), T. brucei has become a new model organism, which is evolutionarily highly divergent from classical models such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. While yeast and other fungi are more related to metazoa including humans (eukaryotic group Opisthokonta), trypanosomatids belong to the distant eukaryotic group called Excavata (3Simpson A.G. Roger A.J. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R693-R696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 4Cavalier-Smith T. Proc. Biol. Sci. 2004; 271: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This group is formed exclusively of unicellular eukaryotes, many of them with highly modified mitochondria (5Lukeš J. Hashimi H. Ziková A. Curr. Genet. 2005; 48: 277-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The mitochondrion of T. brucei is of particular interest, because it undergoes dramatic metabolic and structural changes during the cell cycle between the blood of the mammalian host and the digestive tract of the tsetse fly. An excess of glucose in the mammalian host permits the bloodstream stage to employ glycolysis for energy generation, a significant part of which is localized to specialized peroxisomes called glycosomes (6Michels P.A. Moyersoen J. Krazy H. Galland N. Herman M. Hannaert V. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), producing pyruvate as a major end product. Consequently, the mitochondrion lacks the cytochrome-dependent electron transport chain and the activities of the citric acid cycle enzymes and is thus impaired in its ability to produce ATP by oxidative phosphorylation (7Clayton C.E. Michels P. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 465-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Through its functions as a sink for reducing equivalents from glycolysis, the mitochondrion still plays an indispensable role in the metabolism of blood stages (8Chaudhuri M. Ajayi W. Hill G.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the insect vector, trypanosomes encounter a nutrient-poor environment, where they can only survive through an overall switch in their energy metabolism, primarily by activating the mitochondrion. In the active mitochondria of procyclics, pyruvate is degraded with the benefit of additional ATP synthesis, mainly to acetate and succinate (9van Hellemond J.J. Opperdoes F.R. Tielens A.G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3036-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, most of the excreted succinate is produced in glycosomes (10Besteiro S. Barrett M.P. Riviere L.

The machinery responsible for mitochondrial FeS cluster assembly consists of at least 10 different proteins, the key components being pyridoxal 5-phosphate-dependent cysteine desulfurase IscS, which generates sulfur (S0) from cysteine, and the metallochaperone IscU, which provides the molecular scaffold for the formation of a transient FeS cluster (11Lill R. Mühlenhoff U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 133-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The transient FeS cluster is transferred from IscU to apoproteins during FeS protein maturation (19Kispal G. Sipos K. Lange H. Fekete Z. Bedekovics T. Janaky T. Bassler J. Aguilar Netz D.J. Balk J. Rotte C. Lill R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, mitochondria were shown to play an essential role not only in the biosynthesis of mitochondrial FeS proteins but also in the maturation of FeS proteins localized in the cytosol and nucleus. For example, this essential requirement for the FeS cluster assembly machinery was demonstrated for Rli1, a cytosolic FeS protein that is indispensable to ribosomal functionality (19Kispal G. Sipos K. Lange H. Fekete Z. Bedekovics T. Janaky T. Bassler J. Aguilar Netz D.J. Balk J. Rotte C. Lill R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 20Yarunin A. Panse V.G.

In addition to mitochondria, several components of the mitochondrial FeS cluster assembly machinery were detected in the cytosol and nucleus (21Land T. Rouault T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 807-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 22Tong W.H. Jameson G.N.L. Huynh B.H. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hughes R.M. Rouault T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12344-12351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because no information is available on FeS cluster assembly in trypanosomes, we investigated the function of mitochondria of T. brucei procyclics in this process. Initially, we identified the main components of its FeS cluster assembly machinery and constructed cell lines in which the expression of the IscS and IscU genes was down-regulated by means of RNA interference (RNAi). Analyses of the resulting phenotypes provide the first insight into FeS cluster biogenesis in the mitochondria of parasitic protists and support the hypothesis that the mitochondrion plays a fundamental and evolutionary conserved role in cellular FeS cluster assembly throughout the eukaryotes. Construction of Vectors, Transfection, Cloning, RNAi Induction, and Growth—A 424-bp fragment of the TbiscS2 gene (supplemental material) was amplified by PCR from the T. brucei 427 genomic DNA using oligonucleotides IscS-F1 (5′-CACCATATGGTAGAGATGAAGCGTGATT) and IscS-R1 (5′-CACAAGCTTTTTCCTTCCATCAGCAAGT) (added NdeI and HindIII restriction sites are underlined), was cloned into pCR2.1 TOPO® (Invitrogen) and subcloned in pZJM (25Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Similarly, a large portion of the TbiscU gene (nucleotides 44–528; see supplemental material) was amplified with the primers IscU-F1 (5′-CACCTCGAGCAGCCTCACTTCGGTCACT) and IscU-R1 (5′-TGCACGGATCCCCAACAGCCTCGGACTTAG) (added XhoI and BamHI restriction sites are underlined) and cloned into p2T7-177 (26Wickstead B. Ersfeld K. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 125: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The procyclic T. brucei strain 29-13, transgenic for T7 RNA polymerase and the tetracycline repressor, was grown in SDM-79 medium in the presence of hygromycin and G418 (27Wirtz E. Clayton C. Science. 1995; 268: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Transfection, selection and cloning were performed as described elsewhere (28Vondrušková E. van den B.J. Ziková A.

Synthesis of double-stranded RNA was induced by the addition of 2 μg/ml tetracycline. Growth curves of parental cells and clonal cell lines were obtained using the Z2 Cell Counter (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA) over a period of 8 days after the induction of RNAi. Following confirmation of successful RNAi (see below), one clone for each TbiscS2 and TbiscU was used for further experiments. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis and Northern Blotting—DNA enriched for TbiscS2 mRNA was synthesized by reverse transcription of poly(A)+ RNA with IscS-R2 (5′-CGAATTAAATCTGCCACTTGCGTC) and used as a template for amplification of the 5′ end region of this mRNA with IscS-R3 (5′-GGCAATATTGTTGGACTCCGTTGC) and the upstream spliced leader-specific primer SLTb1 (5′-AACTAACGCTATTATTAGAACAGT). Three sequenced clones were identical. Total RNA was isolated from 5 × 107 exponentially growing noninduced and RNAi-induced cells by extraction with Tri Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). TbiscS2 or TbiscU gene probes were labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dATP (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). Hybridization was carried out using standard procedure (28Vondrušková E. van den B.J.

The cells were washed twice and resuspended in ice-cold SHE buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA) at ∼5 × 109 cells/ml. Aliquots containing 1 mg of protein were resuspended in 350 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer (Invitrogen) and incubated for 4 min at 25 °C with increasing concentrations of digitonin (Merck) dissolved in dimethylformamide and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 2 min. Whole cell lysates were prepared by incubating the same aliquots in 350 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min on ice and centrifuged as above. The resulting supernatants were immediately assayed for the presence of the cytosolic (pyruvate kinase) and mitochondrial (threonine dehydrogenase) marker enzymes. To obtain cytosolic and mitochondria-rich fractions, the concentration of digitonin was used that released the maximum pyruvate kinase activity and no threonine dehydrogenase into the supernatant. This supernatant was considered to represent the cytosolic fraction. Pelleted intact mitochondria were washed once and then resuspended in 350 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer and incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min on ice. After centrifugation, the supernatant containing mitochondrial matrix proteins was collected (the mitochondrial fraction). Enzyme Assays and Determination of Metabolic End Products—The activities of pyruvate kinase and threonine dehydrogenase were monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm as a rate of NADH oxidation or NAD reduction, respectively (31Callens M.

Ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase activity (complex III) was measured in QCR buffer (40 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm sodium malonate, 50 μm horse heart cytochrome c (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.005% dodecylmaltoside) as the rate of 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinol oxidation monitored at 550 nm (prior to use, decylubiquinone (Sigma-Aldrich) was reduced as described elsewhere (34Trumpower B.L. Edwards C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8697-8706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). KCN was added to a final concentration of 200 μm as an inhibitor of interfering oxidase activity. To determine the metabolic end products, ∼8 × 107 cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 200 μl of incubation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline buffer supplemented with 11 mm glucose and 24 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.3), and incubated for 2 h at 27 °C. After centrifugation for 10 min at 1,400 × g, the supernatant was analyzed by HPLC in a PL Hi-Plex H column as described elsewhere (35Vanacova S. Rasoloson D. Razga J. Hrdý I. Kulda J. Tachezy J.

ATP Production in Isolated Mitochondria—Intact mitochondria were prepared from cell aliquots containing 1 mg of protein by digitonin fractionation as described above. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 750 μl of the buffer for in organello ATP production assay (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 15 mm KH2PO4, 0.6 m sorbitol, 10 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and 75-μl aliquots were used for each measurement.

EPR Analysis of FeS Clusters—EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Elexsys E580 spectrometer operating in X-band continuous-wave mode, with an Oxford Instruments ESR9000 liquid helium flow cryostat. The measurement conditions were: temperature, 12 K; microwave power, 20 milliwatts; frequency, 9.38 GHz; and modulation amplitude, 1 millitesla. Genes Coding for TbiscS and TbiscU—The T. brucei genome project data base (www.sanger.ac.uk/) was searched for homologs of IscS and IscU using S. cerevisiae Nfs1p and Isu1p as queries. A BLAST search for IscS identified two homologs in the T. brucei genome, here named TbiscS1 and TbiscS2, with calculated molecular weights of 48,991 and 48,150, respectively. Alignment of their deduced amino acid sequences together with Nfs1p revealed significant differences between the two trypanosome genes (supplemental material). Similar to Nfs1p, TbiscS2 possesses conserved residues corresponding to the active site loop that are responsible for the targeted delivery of sulfur to IscU (38Lauhon C.T. Skovran E. Urbina H.D. Downs D.M. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19551-19558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), as well as the conserved C terminus essential for specific interaction with IscU (39Urbina H.D. Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44521-44526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In contrast, TbiscS1 lacks these regions. Phylogenetic analysis of the two T. brucei proteins indicated that TbiscS2 is closely related to other mitochondrial IscS homologs, whereas TbiscS1 clusters together with putative selenocysteine lyases (data not shown). Thus, TbiscS2 was selected for further studies. To prove that TbiscS2 is transcribed, the spliced leader RNA and primers from the 5′ end of the gene were used for reverse transcription-PCR. In three clones with identical sequences, the splice acceptor site was mapped to 25 bp upstream of the initial methionine, resulting in a very short 5′-untranslated region (data not shown). A BLAST search for Isu1p identified a single IscU homolog (TbiscU) in the T. brucei genome data base with a calculated molecular weight of 19,435. Alignment of the deduced TbiscU amino acid sequence with yeast Isu1p revealed that all three conserved cysteine residues required for the assembly of the transient FeS cluster are present in TbiscU (supplemental material). TbiscS2 and TbiscU Are Localized in the Mitochondrion—PsortII analysis (psort.nibb.ac.jp/) of TbiscS2 and TbiscU predicted N-terminal leader sequences for targeting the proteins into mitochondria as well as putative cleavage sites with the characteristic arginine at the –2 position that is recognized by mitochondrial processing peptidase (supplemental material). To verify the predicted cellular localization of these proteins in procyclic T. brucei, specific polyclonal antibodies were raised against recombinant TbiscS2 and TbiscU and used for immunoblot analysis. In subcellular fractions obtained by differential permeabilization of the cell membranes by increasing concentrations of digitonin (30Moyersoen J. Choe J. Kumar A. Voncken F.G. Hol W.G. Michels P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2059-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), both TbiscS2 and TbiscU were detected in the mitochondrial fractions, whereas no signals were observed in the cytosol (Fig. 1). Antibodies against the MRP2 (28Vondrušková E. van den B.J. Ziková A. Ernst N.L. Stuart K. Benne R. Lukeš J. J. Biol.

The low cellular abundance of TbiscS2 is probably responsible for difficulty in identifying the protein in the whole cell lysate (40Panigrahi A.K. Schnaufer A. Carmean N. Igo Jr., R.P. Gygi S.P.

Inhibition of TbiscS2 and TbiscU Gene Expression by RNAi—A 424-bp-long fragment of TbiscS2 and a 484-bp-long fragment of TbiscU (supplemental material) were cloned into the pZJM (25Wang Z.

Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 125: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) RNAi vectors, respectively. Transfection of both constructs into the procyclics resulted in stable integration into the trypanosome genome as confirmed by Southern hybridization of the digested total DNA (data not shown). Phleomycin-resistant transfectants were cloned by limiting dilution, and RNAi was induced by the addition of tetracycline into the SDM-79 medium. Total RNA was isolated from the noninduced and induced clonal cell lines at different time points and analyzed on Northern blots (Fig. 2). The analysis showed that in the TbiscS2 and TbiscU knock-downs, the corresponding mRNA was almost completely eliminated after 2–3 days of induction, followed by growth inhibition of both mutants. Although the growth of the parental strain 29-13 and noninduced RNAi cells were almost identical, the growth of TbiscS2 knock-down cells gradually slowed down, and the growth of the TbiscU-induced cells was completely inhibited (Fig. 3). The observed phenotypes indicate that both components of the mitochondrial FeS cluster assembly machinery are essential for the viability of the procyclics. Based on the growth curves, days 4 and 7 after RNAi induction were selected for all subsequent biochemical experiments. At these time points, the levels of TbiscS2 and TbiscU mRNA and corresponding proteins in the mitochondria of their respective knock-downs became undetectable by Northern and immunoblot analyses (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Effect of TbiscS2 (A) and TbiscU (B) RNAi on cell growth.

In procyclic trypanosomes, aconitase has dual localization, with 70 and 30% of its total active form being distributed in the mitochondrion and cytosol, respectively (33Saas"
https://openalex.org/W1963612963,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), activated by lowering extracellular pH (pHo), play an important role in normal synaptic transmission in brain and in the pathology of brain ischemia. Like pHo, intracellular pH (pHi) changes dramatically in both physiological and pathological conditions. Although it is known that a drop in pHo activates the ASICs, it is not clear whether alterations of pHi have an effect on these channels. Here we demonstrate that the overall activities of ASICs, including channel activation, inactivation, and recovery from desensitization, are tightly regulated by pHi. In cultured mouse cortical neurons, bath perfusion of the intracellular alkalizing agent quinine increased the amplitude of the ASIC current by ∼50%. In contrast, intracellular acidification by withdrawal of NH4Cl or perfusion of propionate inhibited the current. Increasing pH buffering capacity in the pipette solution with 40 mm HEPES attenuated the effects of quinine and NH4Cl. The effects of intracellular alkalizing/acidifying agents were mimicked by using intracellular solutions with pH directly buffered at high/low values. Increasing pHi induced a shift in H+ dose-response curve toward less acidic pH but a shift in the steady state inactivation curve toward more acidic pH. In addition, alkalizing pHi induced an increase in the recovery rate of ASICs from desensitization. Consistent with its effect on the ASIC current, changing pHi has a significant influence on the acid-induced increase of intracellular Ca2+, membrane depolarization, and acidosis-mediated neuronal injury. Our findings suggest that changes in pHi may play an important role in determining the overall function of ASICs in both physiological and pathological conditions.

Delineating detailed modulation of ASICs by endogenous signaling molecules and biochemical changes is important for better understanding the exact and precise role these channels play in various physiological and pathological conditions.During hypoxia/ischemia, increased anaerobic glycolysis leads to lactic acid accumulation (19Rehncrona S. Ann. Emerg. Med. 1985; 14: 770-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), causing dramatic decreases in tissue pH. For example, pHo typically falls to ∼6.5 under normoglycemic conditions and to below 6.0 under hyperglycemic conditions (19Rehncrona S. Ann. Emerg. Med. 1985; 14: 770-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 20Nedergaard M. Kraig R.P. Tanabe J. Pulsinelli W.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: R581-R588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These drops of pHo are expected to activate homomeric ASIC1a and heteromeric ASIC1a/ASIC2a channels that are highly expressed in the brain (10Xiong Z.G. Zhu X.M. Chu X.P. Minami M. Hey J. Wei W.L.

Physiol. 1991; 260: R581-R588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is clear that a drop of pHo is required to activate the ASICs. However, it is not known whether changes in pHi have any effect on the activities of these channels. Although pHi also drops during ischemia in general, the degree of pHi changes is not homogeneous across all brain regions, and an alkalization of pHi has been demonstrated in cortical penumbra region following the ischemia (22Back T. Hoehn M. Mies G. Busch E. Schmitz B. Kohno K. Hossmann K.A. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 47: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the amplitude of ASIC current, its pH-dependent activation and inactivation, as well as current desensitization all are tightly regulated by the level of pHi; intracellular acidification inhibits whereas alkalization potentiates the activities of ASICs. Consistent with the changes in ASIC current, acid-induced increases of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), membrane depolarization, and acidosis-mediated neuronal injury are dramatically affected by the level of pHi.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPrimary Neuronal Culture—Primary cortical neuronal cultures were prepared from embryonic Swiss mice at 16 days of gestation according to our previously described method (10Xiong Z.G. Zhu X.M. Chu X.P. Minami M. Hey J. Wei W.L. MacDonald J.F. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Simon R.P.

Cerebral cortices from 10-12 embryos were dissected and incubated with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C, dissociated by trituration with fire-polished glass pipettes, and plated on poly-l-ornithine-coated dishes at 1.0 × 106 cells/dish. The neurons were cultured with Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 and glutamax and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere incubator. The cultures were fed twice a week and used for electrophysiological recording 12-21 days after plating.Electrophysiology—Whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed as described previously (10Xiong Z.G. Zhu X.M. Chu X.P. Minami M. Hey J. Wei W.L. MacDonald J.F. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Simon R.P.

Patch pipettes were pulled by a two-step puller (PP83; Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) from thin wall borosilicated glass (1.5 mm diameter; WPI, Sarasota, FL). The pipettes had a resistance of 3-4 MΩ when filled with intracellular solution: 140 mm CsF, 10 mm HEPES, 11 mm EGTA or 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N,′N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), 2 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 1 mm CaCl2, 2mm MgCl2, pH 7.3 (adjusted with CsOH), 290-300 mOsm adjusted with sucrose. For solutions containing 40 mm HEPES, the amount of sucrose was reduced to maintain the osmolarity. Extracellular solution (ECF) contained: 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4 (320-330 mOsm). 500 nm tetrodotoxin was used in all ECF to block the voltage-gated Na+ current and the firing of action potential. Unless otherwise stated, chemicals were purchased from Sigma.Whole cell recordings were done with Axopatch 200B amplifier, Digidata 1320 DAC unit, and pClamp 8 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The data were analyzed using pClamp 8 and Sigmaplot software. Unless otherwise stated, ASIC currents were activated every 2 min to achieve a complete recovery from desensitization. A multibarrel perfusion system (SF-77; Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) was used to achieve a rapid exchange of extracellular solutions.Ca2+ Imaging—Primary cultured neurons grown on 25-mm round glass coverslips were used for Ca2+ imaging experiments as described previously (10Xiong Z.G. Zhu X.M. Chu X.P. Minami M. Hey J. Wei W.L. MacDonald J.F. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Simon R.P. Cell. 2004; 118: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). After being washed three times with normal ECF, the neurons were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester for 40 min at room temperature, followed by three washes and incubation in normal ECF for additional 30 min. The coverslips were then transferred to a perfusion chamber on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon TE300). Neurons were illuminated using a 75 W xenon lamp and observed with a 40× oil immersion UV fluor objective. Video images were taken by a cooled CCD camera (Sensys KAF 1401; Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). Axon Imaging Workbench software (AIW 2.1; Axon Instruments) was used to acquire and analyze digitized images and to control the shutter and filter wheel (Lambda 10-2; Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) for timed illumination of cells at an excitation wavelength of either 340 or 380 nm. Fura-2 fluorescence was detected at an emission wavelength of 510 nm. 340/380-nm ratio images were acquired by averaging pixel ratio values in circumscribed regions of neurons in the field of view. SigmaPlot software was used for further data analysis and plotting.Cell Injury Assay—Acidosis-induced injury of neurons was studied as described previously (10Xiong Z.G. Zhu X.M. Chu X.P. Minami M.

Neurons grown in 24-well culture plates were washed three times with ECF and randomly divided into different treatment groups. The cells were pretreated at pH 7.4 with or without pHi modifying agents for 15 min and then subjected to an acid incubation with the same agents. Following2hof acid incubation in the absence or presence of pHi modifying agents, the neurons were washed with ECF and incubated in Neurobasal medium in a conventional cell culture incubator at 37 °C. LDH released in the culture medium was measured using the LDH assay kit (Roche Applied Science). 6 h after the beginning of the acid treatment, 50 μl of medium was transferred from each culture well to 96-well plates and mixed with an equal volume of reaction solution provided by the kit. After mixing and a 30-min incubation, optical density was measured at 492 nm utilizing a microplate reader (Spectra Max Plus; Molecular Devices). Background absorbance at 620 nm was subtracted. The 6-h LDH release for each well was normalized against the maximum releasable LDH, obtained by 30 min of incubation with 0.5% Triton X-100 at the end of each experiment.For fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and propidium iodide (PI) staining of live and dead cells respectively, the neurons were incubated in ECF containing FDA (5 μm) and PI (2 μm) for 30 min followed by three washes with dye-free ECF. Alive (FDA-positive) and dead (PI-positive) cells were viewed and counted on a microscope (Nikon) equipped with epifluorescence at 580/630 nm excitation/emission for PI and 500/550 nm for FDA. The images were collected using a digital camera (Nikon Cool-pix 5000).Data Analysis—All of the data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Student's t test and analysis of variance were used for statistical analysis where appropriate. The criterion of significance was set at p < 0.05. pH dose-response curves and steady state inactivation curves were fitted using the equation: I = a/(1 + (C50/pH)n), where a is the amplitude of ASIC current, C50 is the pH at which a half-maximal response is induced, and n is the Hill coefficient.RESULTSIntracellular Alkalization Potentiates the ASIC Current—As shown previously, a rapid reduction of pHo from 7.4 to below 7.0 activates inward, amiloride-sensitive, ASIC currents in all cultured mouse cortical neurons voltage-clamped at -60 mV (10Xiong Z.G. Zhu X.M. Chu X.P. Minami M. Hey J. Wei W.L. MacDonald J.F. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Simon R.P.

Vision Res. 1996; 36: 3925-3931Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), to the extracellular solution, following the recording of stable ASIC currents activated by a pHo drop from 7.4 to 6.5. In our previous studies, we have shown that bath perfusion of 0.5 mm quinine for 2 min increased pHi by ∼0.5 unit (23Chu X.P. Zhu X.M. Wei W.L. Li G.H. Simon R.P. MacDonald J.F. Xiong Z.G. J. Physiol. 2003; 550: 385-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, perfusion of quinine (0.5 mm) for 2 min induced a reversible increase in the peak amplitude of ASIC currents by 25.8 ± 8.8% (n = 8, p < 0.05). The potentiation of the ASIC current by quinine is dose-dependent, because increasing the concentration of quinine to 1.0 mm increased the peak amplitude of the ASIC currents by 47.0 ± 8.9% (Fig. 1A; n = 4, p < 0.05). Similar to the peak current, the sustained component of the ASIC currents, measured at the end of 6-s acid application, was dramatically increased by quinine (0.5 mm) by 99.3 ± 25.9% (n = 6, p < 0.05; Fig. 1A2). In addition, the desensitization of the ASIC current was significantly reduced by intracellular alkalization, as reflected by an increase in decay time constant (τ). 2 min after 0.5 mm quinine, τ was increased from 1.67 ± 0.19 to 2.17 ± 0.28 s (n = 15, p < 0.05).Changing pHi may affect the buffering capacity of EGTA (25Schubert R. J. Vasc. Res. 1996; 33: 86-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), thus altering the concentration of [Ca2+]i, which might in turn affect the ASIC current. To rule out this possibility, we have performed the same experiment using an intracellular solution containing 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N,′N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) (11 mm), a pH-insensitive Ca2+ chelator (25Schubert R. J. Vasc. Res. 1996; 33: 86-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Inclusion of high concentration of BAPTA did not affect the potentiation of the ASIC current by quinine. For example, 1 mm quinine still potentiated the peak amplitude of the ASIC currents by 38.0 ± 9.3% (n = 4, p < 0.05), which is not significantly different from its effect with EGTA in the pipette solution. These data suggest that a change of intracellular Ca2+ is not required for the effect of pHi on ASICs (not shown).Intracellular Acidification Inhibits the ASIC Current—We then examined whether intracellular acidification has an effect opposite to alkalization on the ASIC current. Two methods were used to induce an intracellular acidification: 1) addition and withdrawal of NH4Cl and 2) bath perfusion of the weak acid propionate. Brief exposure (∼3 min) to NH4Cl followed by washout is a common method for inducing intracellular acidification (26Deitmer J.W. Ellis D. J. Physiol. 1980; 304: 471-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 27Boron W.F. De Weer P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1976; 67: 91-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Bath perfusion of NH4Cl causes a transient rise of pHi by the formation of NH +4 from NH3 + H+. Upon withdrawal of NH4Cl, a relatively long lasting decrease of pHi takes place because of dissociation of NH +4 into H+ + NH3. In hippocampal neurons, a 3-min perfusion of 20 mm NH4Cl followed by washout induced up to a 0.5-unit decrease in pHi (28Bonnet U. Leniger T. Wiemann M. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 2067-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our own studies showed that perfusion/withdrawal of 15 mm NH4Cl induced ∼0.4 unit decrease in pHi (23Chu X.P. Zhu X.M. Wei W.L. Li G.H. Simon R.P. MacDonald J.F. Xiong Z.G. J. Physiol. 2003; 550: 385-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To induce intracellular acidification in cultured mouse cortical neurons, 15 mm NH4Cl was perfused for 3 min followed by washout with normal ECF. As shown in Fig. 1B, 2 min following NH4Cl withdrawal, the peak amplitude of the ASIC current was decreased by 25.3 ± 3.5% from its control value (n = 7, p < 0.01).The weak acid propionate is known to transport protons across membranes and decrease pHi in a dose-dependent manner (29Roos A. Boron W.F. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 296-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar, 30Sharp A.P. Thomas R.C. J. Physiol. 1981; 312: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To further test the effect of changing pHi on the ASIC current, ECF containing 10 mm propionate was perfused to the neurons following the recording of stable ASIC currents. Consistent with NH4Cl removal, 2 min of perfusion of propionate decreased the peak amplitude of the ASIC current by 19.4 ± 5.2% (n = 6, p < 0.05; Fig. 1B).To provide additional evidence that the levels of pHi regulate the activities of ASICs, we then compared the amplitude of the ASIC current recorded with intracellular solutions directly buffered at different pH values. To minimize the variation of the current amplitude in different neurons, current density was used. It is expected that the density of the ASIC current recorded with a high pHi (e.g. 8.0) should be larger than the one recorded with a low pHi (e.g. 6.0). As shown in Fig. 1C, the density of the ASIC current recorded at pHi of 8.0 (30.3 ± 3.2 pA/pF, n = 32) is significantly larger than the one recorded at pHi of 7.3 (20.8 ± 2.0 pA/pF, n = 30, p < 0.05), and the density of the ASIC current recorded at pHi of 6.0 (14.1 ± 1.5 pA/pF, n = 29) is significantly smaller than the current recorded at pHi of 7.3 (p < 0.01). Further studies demonstrated that the density of ASIC currents change with pHi in a linear fashion within the range of pH tested from 8.0 to 5.5, with a slope of 8.1 pA/pF per unit pH change (Fig. 1C2). The rate of desensitization of the ASIC current was also affected by the level of pHi. At 7.3, the decay time constant τ was 2.22 ± 0.48 s (n = 22). However, it was 2.73 ± 0.19 s at pH 8.0 (n = 32, p < 0.05). Together, these findings strongly indicate that changes in intracellular proton concentration or pHi modulate the activity of ASICs; intracellular alkalization increases, whereas acidification decreases the activity of ASICs.Increasing HEPES Concentration in the Intracellular Solution Eliminates or Reduces the Changes of ASIC Currents Induced by Alkalinizing and Acidifying Agents—To further determine whether the effects of quinine, NH4Cl, and propionate on the ASIC current are indeed due to the changes in pHi, we performed additional experiments with intracellular solutions containing higher concentration of HEPES (40 mm). It is expected that increasing the concentration of HEPES in the pipette solution will increase its pH buffering capability, thus reducing the degree of pHi change induced by alkalizing or acidifying agents and their effects on the ASIC current. With 40 mm HEPES in the pipette solution, application of 0.5 mm quinine no longer potentiated the ASIC current. 2 min following the perfusion of quinine, the peak amplitude of the ASIC current was 1.02 ± 0.02 times of the control value (n = 6, p > 0.05). Similarly, withdrawal of 15 mm NH4Cl did not induce a significant inhibition of the ASIC current (1.03 ± 0.05 times of the control value, n = 5, p > 0.05, not shown).Intracellular Alkalization Potentiates the ASIC Current by Increasing the Affinity of ASICs to H+—To explore the potential mechanism(s) underlying the modulation of the ASIC current by pHi, pH dose-response curves were constructed before and after bath perfusion of quinine. As shown in Fig. 2 (A and B), application of 0.5 mm quinine resulted in a significant leftward shift of the pH dose-response curve (pH0.5 before quinine: 6.10 ± 0.21; after quinine: 6.49 ± 0.08; n = 5, p < 0.05), indicating an increase in the affinity of channels to H+. No significant change of the Hill coefficient was observed (before quinine, 1.16 ± 0.04; after quinine, 1.36 ± 0.03). To determine whether the shift of pH dose-response by quinine was indeed due to a change of pHi, we performed the same experiment in the presence of 40 mm HEPES in pipette solution. No significant shift in pH dose-response curve could be induced by quinine when 40 mm HEPES was included in the intercellular solution (pH0.5 values were 6.12 ± 0.05 before and 6.06 ± 0.11 after 0.5 mm quinine, n = 3, p > 0.05; Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Effects of changing pHi on pH dose-response curve. A, representative traces showing pH-dependent activation of the ASIC currents in mouse cortical neurons before and after bath application of 0.5 mm quinine. B, summary data from five neurons showing the effect of 0.5 mm quinine on pH dose-response curve. pH0.5 values before and after quinine were 6.10 ± 0.21 and 6.49 ± 0.08 respectively (n = 5, p < 0.05). C, increasing pH buffering capacity with 40 mm HEPES in the pipette solution abolished the effect of quinine. D, pH dose-response curves with pHi directly buffered at high (8.0) and low (5.5) values. The dose-response curve with pHi at 8.0 (pH0.5 = 6.21 ± 0.05, n = 5) was shifted to the left of that obtained with pHi at 6.0 (pH0.5 = 5.52 ± 0.04, n = 5, p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further prove that changing pHi plays an important role in the shift of pH dose-response, we have also constructed pH dose-response curves with pHi directly buffered at high and low values (8.0 and 5.5). As shown in Fig. 2D, the pH0.5 for dose-response curve at pHi of 5.5 (5.52 ± 0.04, n = 5) was significantly lower than that recorded with a pHi of 8.0 (6.21 ± 0.05, n = 5, p < 0.01). Together, these findings strongly suggest that the potentiation of ASIC current by intracellular alkalization is attributed to an increase in the apparent affinity of ASICs to H+.Modulation of ASIC Activity by pHi Is Voltage-independent—To determine whether intracellular protons act at a site within the transmembrane electric field, e.g. within the channel pore, we examined whether the effect of pHi on the ASIC current is voltage-dependent. Currents activated by decreasing pHo from 7.4 to 6.5 were recorded at various holding potentials ranged from -60 to +40 mV, and the effects of quinine (0.5 mm) or propionate (10 mm) on the amplitude of the ASIC current were compared at different membrane potentials.Quinine and propionate only changed the slope of the I-V curve, with little effect on the reversal potential of the ASIC currents (not shown). The potentiation/inhibition of the current amplitude by quinine/propionate was not affected by the membrane potential. For example, at -60 mV, quinine increased the current to 1.34 ± 0.11 times of the control value and propionate decreased the current to 0.71 ± 0.05 of the control value, although at -20 mV, quinine increased the current amplitude to 1.30 ± 0.01 of the control value and propionated decreased the current to 0.64 ± 0.09 (n = 4, p > 0.05). Together, these data indicate that the modulation of ASICs by pHi is voltage-independent.Effects of pHi on Steady State Inactivation of the ASICs—To further explore the mechanism underlying the potentiation/inhibition of the ASIC current by changing pHi, the effect of quinine on steady state inactivation of ASICs was also examined. Neurons were incubated in extracellular solutions at various conditioning pH values between 7.8 and 6.6 for ∼4 min before the ASIC currents were activated by a drop in pH to 6.0. The amplitude of the current activated with different conditioning pH values was normalized to the one activated with a conditioning pH of 7.8 (where there is no apparent inactivation) and plotted against the value of conditioning pH. Fig. 3 (A and B) shows the steady state inactivation curves before and after bath perfusion of 1 mm quinine. Application of quinine shifted the inactivation curv"

Previous studies suggested that the diversity and specificity of insulin signal transduction are accomplished by both subcellular localization of receptor and the selective activation of downstream signaling molecules. The small GTPase Rab5 is a key regulator of endocytosis. Three Rab5 isoforms (Rab5a, -5b, and -5c) have been identified. Here we exploited the RNA interference technique to specifically knock down individual Rab5 isoforms to determine the cellular function of Rab5 in distinct insulin signaling pathways. Small interference RNA against a single Rab5 isoform had no effect on protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt or MAPK activation by insulin in NIH3T3 cells overexpressing human insulin receptor. However, simultaneous knockdown of all three Rab5 isoforms dramatically attenuated PKB/Akt activation by insulin without affecting MAPK activation. This inhibition of PKB/Akt activation was because of the impaired interaction between insulin receptor substrate 1 and the p85α subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. These results indicate a requirement of Rab5 in presenting p85 to insulin receptor substrate 1. Additional evidence supporting a role for Rab5 was suggested by studies with GAPex-5, a vps9 domain containing exchange factor. Down-regulation of GAPex-5 impaired insulin-stimulated PKB/Akt activation. Collectively, this study indicates the involvement of Rab5 in insulin signaling.

Both environmental and genetic factors contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although detailed mechanisms underlying the development of this disorder remain unknown, impairment of insulin action has been clearly established as an early defect in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (1Saltiel A.R.

Activated IR phosphorylates a variety of intracellular substrates, most notably the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins (3White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 4White M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E413-E422Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins provides binding sites for downstream effectors with Src homolog 2 domains or phosphotyrosine binding domains that activate multiple signaling pathways required for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and maintenance of energy homeostasis (5Bevan P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1429-1430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lee Y.H. White M.F. Arch. Pharm. Res. 2004; 27: 361-370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Type 1A phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) represents a primary target of insulin action (7Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IRS1 and/or IRS2 on tyrosine residues by activated IR creates recognition sites for the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, thereby allowing the activation of the p110 catalytic subunit (8Shepherd P.R. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2005; 183: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). PI3K-generated phosphoinositides PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 recruit protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase to the membrane, resulting in PKB/Akt phosphorylation and activation (9Milburn C.C.

Recent studies also demonstrated a second requisite pathway that involves recruitment of tyrosine-phosphorylated Cbl to lipid rafts and activation of the lipid raft-associated small G protein TC10 in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (1Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 12Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E.

Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Synergistic cooperation of these two signaling pathways leads to the full activation of GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane (PM) and glucose uptake in adipocytes (1Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 12Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E.

Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). After binding to insulin, the activated receptor complex is internalized into endosomes from which receptors are either recycled back to the PM or transported to lysosomes for degradation (14Fiory F. Oriente F. Miele C. Romano C. Trencia A. Alberobello A.T. Esposito I. Valentino R. Beguinot F. Formisano P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11137-11145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Knutson V.P. Ronnett G.V. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2822-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, receptor internalization represents a mechanism for insulin degradation and receptor deactivation. However, receptor internalization may be required for full activation of receptor signaling because internalization may be important for activated receptors to access their downstream effectors, which may not reside at the PM/cytosol interface (16Di Guglielmo G.M. Drake P.G. Baass P.C. Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Previous studies using various models have suggested that insulin stimulation results in the endosomal accumulation and concentration of IR kinase that is both tyrosine-phosphorylated and active toward exogenous substrates (17Kublaoui B. Lee J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 59-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 18Wang B. Balba Y. Knutson V.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that endosomes are important sites for IRS-1 phosphorylation and PI3K activation in rat adipocytes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes (19Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24442-24450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20Inoue G. Cheatham B. Emkey R. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11548-11555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation studies have demonstrated that insulin causes a small increase in the level of p85α in the PM-containing fraction but a much larger increase in the microsomal fraction (21Nave B.T. Haigh R.J. Hayward A.C. Siddle K. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies suggest the functional importance of spatial compartmentalization exhibited by signaling molecules in insulin signaling and indicate that trafficking through the endosomal apparatus might be important for proper insulin action. However, expression of a GTPase-deficient dynamin (K44A) decreases the internalization of IR in adipocytes but has no effect on both insulin-stimulated Akt and MAPK activation (22Kao A.W. Ceresa B.P. Santeler S.R. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25450-25457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). On the contrary, K44A/dynamin partially inhibits insulin-stimulated MAPK activation without affecting Akt activation in hepatoma cells (23Ceresa B.P. Kao A.W. Santeler S.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3862-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These results suggest that full activation of distinct insulin signaling pathways may require different thresholds for the amounts of internalized IR in different biological environments. Rab5 is a protein localized to the PM, clathrin-coated vesicles, and early endosomes and is ubiquitously expressed (24Somsel Rodman J. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 183-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rab5 has been implicated in membrane receptor internalization and in cytoskeletal-dependent organelle movement (25Lanzetti L. Palamidessi A. Areces L. Scita G. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2004; 429: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 26Lanzetti L. Di Fiore P.P. Scita G. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). GTP-Rab5 also coordinates endosome fusion by interacting with several Rab5 effectors such as PI3Ks, Rabaptin-5, EEA-1, and Rabenosyn-5 (27Simpson J.C. Jones A.T. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2005; 72: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28Christoforidis S. McBride H.M. Burgoyne R.D. Zerial M. Nature. 1999; 397: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Recently, Rab5 has been shown to be a key regulator connecting the lipid raft-dependent endocytosis and the clathrin-dependent endocytosis pathways (29Shin H.W. Hayashi M. Christoforidis S. Lacas-Gervais S. Hoepfner S. Wenk M.R. Modregger J. Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Wilm M. Nystuen A. Frankel W.N. Solimena M. De Camilli P. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 607-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The presence of a subgroup of three Rab5 proteins (Rab5a, Rab5b, and Rab5c) in mammalian cells has been demonstrated from yeast to mammals. Original studies demonstrated that the three Rab5 isoforms share similar subcellular localization and regulatory functions in the early endocytic pathway (30Bucci C. Lutcke A. Steele-Mortimer O. Olkkonen V.M. Dupree P. Chiariello M. Bruni C.B. Simons K. Zerial M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although they are similar functionally, the three Rab5 proteins are differentially phosphorylated in vitro (31Chiariello M. Bruni C.B. Bucci C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of Rab5 isoforms utilizing RNA interference (RNAi) suggested that down-regulation of a single Rab5 isoform has no effect on either EGF or transferrin (Tfn) internalization (32Huang F. Khvorova A. Marshall W. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16657-16661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). However, down-regulation of all three Rab5 isoforms significantly decreased the internalization of both EGF and Tfn (32Huang F. Khvorova A. Marshall W. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16657-16661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Experiments utilizing dominant negative Rab5A suggest a requirement for Rab5 activity in both IR and EGF internalization (14Fiory F. Oriente F. Miele C. Romano C. Trencia A. Alberobello A.T.

Highfield H. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Wells A. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Rab5A interacts directly with two distinct PI3Ks, type I PI3K and hVps34 (34Christoforidis S. Miaczynska M. Ashman K. Wilm M. Zhao L. Yip S.C. Waterfield M.D. Backer J.M. Zerial M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). More recent research showed that p85α binds to both GDP and GTP forms of Rab5A and that it functions as a GTPase-activating Protein for Rab5A (35Chamberlain M.D. Berry T.R. Pastor M.C. Anderson D.H.

Identification of PI4-, and PI5-phosphatases as novel Rab5 effectors reinforced the involvement of Rab5A in phosphoinositide turnover in the endocytic pathway (29Shin H.W. Hayashi M. Christoforidis S. Lacas-Gervais S. Hoepfner S. Wenk M.R. Modregger J. Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Wilm M. Nystuen A. Frankel W.N. Solimena M. De Camilli P. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 607-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Because temporal and spatial distribution of phosphoinositides is critical for insulin-stimulated PKB/Akt activation, Rab5 and its effectors have emerged as important regulators of insulin action.

Anti-insulin receptor β-subunit was obtained from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). Anti-IRS1 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Michael M. Mueckler (Washington University). Anti-GAPex-5 polyclonal antibody was raised against the amino-terminal residues 1–17 and was purified using ImmunoPure (A) IgG purification kit (Pierce). Cell Culture of NIH3T3/hIR Cells and Stimulation with Insulin—NIH3T3/hIR cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were starved by incubation in DMEM without serum overnight. Starved cells were stimulated with pre-warmed DMEM with the indicated concentrations of insulin for 10 min at 37 °C. Protein Extraction, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot—Cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at 4 °C for 30 min with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture solution (Sigma). The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C prior to separation by SDS-PAGE. The resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the membranes were blocked with powdered milk solution (5% (w/v)). Individual proteins were detected with specific antibodies and visualized by blotting with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies as described. For immunoprecipitation, 100 μg of clarified lysate protein was incubated with antibodies (0.5 μg) overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-agarose (Sigma) for 1 h at 4°C, and the beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer before solubilization in SDS sample loading buffer. siRNA Construction and Transfection—The siRNAs directed against mouse Rab5A, Rab5B, Rab5C, GAPex-5, and dynamin 2 were constructed and purified employing the Silencer™ siRNA construction kit (Ambion) as described. One day before transfection, NIH3T3/hIR cells were plated in growth medium without antibiotics to obtain 30–40% confluence at the time of transfection. The transfection of siRNA (20 nm final concentration) was performed using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences specific for mouse Rab5A (5′-AAGCACAGTCCTATGCAGATG-3′), mouse Rab5B (5′-AATCCGTGTGTTTAGATGACA-3′), mouse Rab5C (5′-AAGCAGCCATTGTGGTCTATG-3′), mouse GAPex-5 (5′-AAGAATCGATTACCTATAGCA-3′), and mouse dynamin 2 (5′-CACCACACGTGTTGAACTTGA-3′) were selected based upon their potency to inhibit the target gene expression. A scrambled siRNA (Ambion) was used as a negative control. Horseradish Peroxidase Uptake in NIH3T3/hIR Cells—NIH3T3/hIR cells cultured in 6-well plates were transfected with siRNA and starved as described above. The cells were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in 1 ml of DMEM in the presence or absence of 10 nm insulin. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) uptake was initiated by adding 1 ml of DMEM containing 4 mg/ml HRP and 1% bovine serum albumin. The uptake was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were washed and lysed, and the resulting cell lysate was assayed for HRP activity as described previously (38Li G. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24475-24480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biotinylation and Internalization of Cell Surface Insulin Receptor—Cell surface insulin receptor was labeled with biotin as described (39Levy-Toledano R. Caro L.H. Hindman N. Taylor S.I. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1803-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent NIH3T3/hIR cells pretreated with siRNAs were washed three times with ice-cold PBS-Ca-Mg (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2) followed by incubation with a solution containing 0.5 mg/ml EZ-Link® Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) in PBS-Ca-Mg at 4 °C for 30 min. The reaction was quenched by washing the cells three times with ice-cold PBS-Ca-Mg containing 15 mm glycine. The cells were then incubated in binding buffer (120 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm KCl, 15 mm NaAc, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mg/ml BSA) in the absence or presence of 10 nm insulin for 20 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS and treated with cold DMEM containing HEPES (20 mm, pH 7.4) and Pronase (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were then washed three times with cold PBS containing BSA (10 mg/ml) to quench the Pronase activity. The collected cell pellets were lysed as described above, and the biotinylated proteins were purified using MagnaBind™ streptavidin beads (Pierce) as described in the product instructions. Protein Extraction from White Adipose Tissue of Zucker Rats—Female obese Zucker (fa/fa) rats and lean congenic controls (5–6 weeks old) were housed and maintained with a 12-h light/12-h dark photoperiod. Animals were sacrificed (asphyxiated by CO2), and inguinal fat pads (WAT) were collected as described (40Su X. Mancuso D.J. Bickel P.E. Jenkins C.M. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21740-21748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Proteins from WAT were extracted as described previously (40Su X. Mancuso D.J. Bickel P.E.

Miaczynska M. Ashman K. Wilm M. Zhao L. Yip S.C. Waterfield M.D. Backer J.M. Zerial M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 35Chamberlain M.D. Berry T.R. Pastor M.C. Anderson D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48607-48614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To determine whether specific isoforms of Rab5 affect insulin signaling, siRNAs directed against Rab5a, -5b, and -5c were synthesized. siRNA duplexes were transfected into NIH3T3/hIR cells. Forty eight hours later, the cells were lysed, and the extent of Rab5 silencing was quantitated by Western blotting. The siRNAs effectively depleted the appropriate Rab5 isoform by over 90% of levels observed in the scrambled negative control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 1A). No off-target silencing was observed (Fig. 1A). To verify the specificities of the Rab5 antibodies used in this study, Western blots were carried out on purified His tag Rab5a, -5b, and -5c proteins. The results in Fig. 1B showed that the antibodies specifically detected their target proteins. Utilizing RNAi-mediated depletion of Rab5 GTPases, we examined whether Rab5 GTPases are required for insulin-stimulated activation of PKB/Akt and MAPK. NIH3T3/hIR cells were treated with siRNA against Rab5a, -5b, or -5c prior to starvation and insulin stimulation. Total cell lysates were prepared in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors and subjected to Western blot analysis. Knockdown of a single Rab5 isoform had no significant effects on insulin-stimulated PKB/Akt activation (Fig. 2A). Moreover, insulin-stimulated MAPK activation was also not affected by siRNA against a single isoform of Rab5 (Fig. 2A). A recent study demonstrated that Rab5a is redundant, and inhibition of EGF and Tfn required the depletion of all three Rab5 isoforms (32Huang F. Khvorova A. Marshall W. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16657-16661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Accordingly, NIH3T3/hIR cells were treated with a nucleotide duplex pool of siRNAs against all three Rab5 isoforms. Interestingly, depletion of all three Rab5 isoforms dramatically decreased insulin-stimulated PKB/Akt activation (Fig. 2, B and C). This effect was likely not due to the regulation of the IR expression level because Rab5 depletion did not alter the total amount of IR (Fig. 3). On the contrary, this result predicts a role for Rab5 in the phosphorylation cascade of insulin signaling. To reveal whether Rab5 is required for different insulin signaling pathways, the effect of Rab5 depletion on MAPK activation was studied. Interestingly, depletion of all three Rab5 isoforms did not decrease insulin-stimulated MAPK activation, but slightly increased MAPK activation under basal conditions in the absence of insulin (Fig. 2B). Collectively, these results demonstrate that Rab5 has distinct effects on different insulin-signaling pathways. These results also suggest the cooperative and redundant regulation of insulin signaling by three Rab5 isoforms.FIGURE 3Down-regulation of all three Rab5 isoforms has no effect on insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IR and IRS1. NIH3T3/hIR cells were transfected with negative control (NC) siRNA or siRNAs against Rab5 (5A, 5B, and 5C) as indicated. Cells were starved and stimulated with 10 nm insulin at 37 °C for 10 min as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The total lysates were prepared, and the IR or IRS1 proteins were immunoprecipitated. The resulting immunoprecipitates (IP) or whole cell lysates (WCL) were subjected to immunoblot (IB) analysis utilizing antibodies as indicated. The experiment was repeated three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Rab5 Is Required for Insulin-stimulated Association of IRS1 and p85α but Not the Phosphorylation of IR nor IRS1—Binding of insulin to IR results in the auto-phosphorylation of IR, which is followed by the recruitment and phosphorylation of IRS1. To explore the mechanism underlying Rab5-mediated PKB/Akt activation by insulin, the effects of Rab5 on insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IR and IRS1 were examined. NIH3T3/hIR cells, pretreated with scrambled negative control siRNA or siRNAs against Rab5a, -5b, and -5c, were starved and treated with 10 nm insulin for 10 min. Total lysates were prepared, and the IR or IRS1 proteins were immunoprecipitated. The resulting immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blot analysis using a phosphotyrosine antibody. Elimination of Rab5 proteins did not alter the phosphorylation of IR or IRS1 by insulin (Fig. 3), suggesting that the target of Rab5 lies downstream of IRS1 phosphorylation. Recruitment of the p85 subunit of type I PI3K to IRS1 represents a crucial step for the activation of PI3K by insulin. It was therefore of interest to test whether IRS1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and the resulting immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blot using an antibody against p85α. siRNAs against Rab5 significantly decreased the amount of p85α that was pulled down by IRS1 (Fig. 4). Reciprocally, down-regulation of all Rab5 isoforms decreased the amount of IRS1 that was co-immunoprecipitated with p85α using anti-p85α antibody (Fig. 4). These results demonstrate that the insulin-stimulated association between IRS1 and p85α requires Rab5. The data suggest that the impaired association between IRS1 and p85α results in decreased PKB/Akt activation. GAPex-5 Contributes to Rab5-mediated PKB/Akt Activation by Insulin—Previous studies suggested that a pool of IRS1 proximal to plasma membrane is important for downstream insulin signaling, whereas the cytosolic pool is totally dispensable (41Murata H. Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21607-21614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because our results indicate that the recruitment of p85 to IRS1 requires Rab5, a pool of Rab5 localized proximal to the PM might be activated by insulin treatment. Rab5 can be activated by various exchange factors, including Rin1 (42Tall G.G. Barbieri M.A. Stahl P.D. Horazdovsky B.F. Dev.

https://openalex.org/W2043513358,"We and others have shown that foam cell formation initiated by exposing macrophages to oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) triggers the differential expression of a number of proteins. Specifically, our experiments have identified peroxiredoxin I (Prx I) as one of these up-regulated proteins. The peroxiredoxins, a family of peroxidases initially described for their antioxidant capability, have generated recent interest for their potential to regulate signaling pathways. Those studies, however, have not examined peroxiredoxin for a potential dual functionality as both cytoprotective antioxidant and signal modulator in a single, oxidant-stressed system. In this report, we examine the up-regulation of Prx I in macrophages in response to oxLDL exposure and its ability to function as both antioxidant enzyme and regulator of p38 MAPK activation. As an antioxidant, induction of Prx I expression led to improved cell survival following treatment with oxLDL or tert-butyl hydroperoxide. The improved survival coincided with a decrease in measurable reactive oxygen species (ROS), and both the increased survival and reduced ROS were reversed by Prx I small interfering RNA transfection. Additionally, our data show that activation of p38 MAPK in oxLDL-treated macrophages was dependent on the up-regulation of Prx I. Reduction of Prx I expression by small interfering RNA transfection resulted in a significant decrease in p38 MAPK activation, whereas the up-regulation of Prx I expression with either oxLDL or ethoxyquin led to increased p38 MAPK activation. These results are consistent with multiple roles for Prx I in macrophage-derived foam cells that include functionality as both an antioxidant and a regulator of oxidant-sensitive signal transduction.

This internalization generates lipid-laden macrophages, known as foam cells, that accumulate into fatty streaks and become potential sites for the continued development of advanced atherosclerosis (3Schaffner T.

Overall, the net effect of these changes has all of the characteristics of a vicious cycle that increases the inflammatory response, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cell recruitment, and cell proliferation. These factors combine to drive progression of the lesion from the initial fatty streak toward the advanced atherosclerotic lesion.We have recently examined changes in protein and mRNA expression that accompany foam cell formation and, among other effects, observed an up-regulated antioxidant response (13Conway J.P.

Prx I–IV are categorized as typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins, distinct from the atypical 2-Cys (Prx V) and 1-Cys peroxiredoxin (Prx VI). In humans, Prx I–IV share >65% protein sequence homology, including the two conserved cysteines responsible for peroxide reduction. These 2-Cys peroxiredoxins function as homodimers, in which one conserved cysteine (Cys51 in Prx I) forms an intermolecular disulfide with the second conserved cysteine (Cys172 in Prx I) upon reduction of a substrate. The disulfide is reduced by the electron donor thioredoxin, reactivating peroxiredoxin antioxidant capability. At elevated oxidant levels, Prx I–IV can be inactivated through the overoxidation of the active site cysteine to sulfinic acid (Cys-SO2) or sulfonic acid (Cys-SO3) (18Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Woo H.A.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 9018-9026Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar).The induction of the peroxiredoxins is generally related to a cellular antioxidant response. However, recent findings suggest alternative functionality for the peroxiredoxin family, including the ability to modulate various signaling pathways. Prx II, for example, is believed to regulate peroxide levels that would otherwise inhibit phosphatases, such as PTEN (24Kwon J. Lee S.R. Yang K.S. Ahn Y. Kim Y.J. Stadtman E.R. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16419-16424Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). PTEN converts the signaling molecule phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate, inhibiting the downstream activation of Akt kinase. Thus, increased Prx II activity is able to protect and support increased PTEN activity and prevent the downstream phosphorylation of Akt targets. Additionally, Prx II can regulate H2O2 levels produced in response to tumor necrosis factor-α and thus limit the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 MAPKs in response to increased peroxide levels (35Kang S.W.

One report invoking a similar role for Prx I in intracellular signaling has also been made. In those experiments, the Schizosaccharomyces pombe 2-Cys peroxiredoxin Tpx1, the yeast homolog for mammalian Prx I, was shown to regulate the peroxide-induced activation of StyI, the yeast homolog for mammalian p38 (36Veal E.A.

The regulation occurs through a direct association of Tpx1 with StyI, forming an intermolecular disulfide that protects StyI from oxidant-induced inactivation (36Veal E.A. Findlay V.J. Day A.M. Bozonet S.M. Evans J.M. Quinn J. Morgan B.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 129-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A parallel role for mammalian Prx I in p38 regulation in macrophages would be significant, considering the downstream effects of p38 activation (37Jing Q. Xin S.M. Cheng Z.J. Zhang W.B. Zhang R. Qin Y.W. Pei G. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 38Hsu H.Y. Twu Y.C. J. Biol.

The oxLDL-induced formation of foam cells from macrophages is shown to result in the up-regulation of active, rather than oxidatively inactive, Prx I. By applying methods to either induce or inhibit Prx I protein expression, our data show that Prx I up-regulation prior to foam cell formation promotes cell survival and that the protective effect of Prx I corresponds directly to its ability to reduce reactive oxygen species. Additionally, the role of Prx I as a modulator of p38 activity is established by demonstrating the dependence of p38 phosphorylation on Prx I expression. Our results are consistent with a dual role for Prx I, in which 1) induced expression can provide antioxidant functionality by reducing cytotoxic levels of ROS, and 2) the extent of Prx I expression can govern the level of p38 MAPK activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—siRNA and siPORT amine transfection reagent were obtained from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). Rabbit polyclonal antibody for Prx I was obtained from BioMol International (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody for Prx I-SO3 and mouse monoclonal antibody for GAPDH were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies for p38, phosphorylated p38 (Thr180/Tyr182), Akt, and phosphorylated Akt (Ser473) were obtained from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). For detection of ROS, 5- (and 6-) chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA), was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Ethoxyquin, hydrogen peroxide, and tert-butyl hydroperoxide were purchased from Sigma. The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB-203580 was obtained in a 1 mg/ml Me2SO solution from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA).Lipoprotein Preparation—Fresh human plasma was obtained from the Cleveland Clinic Blood Bank, and the LDL was isolated by differential ultracentrifugation (1.019 < d < 1.063 g/ml) (39Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6460) Google Scholar). This LDL preparation, in NaBr solution containing 0.02% EDTA, was dialyzed against 0.9% NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 0.02% EDTA (pH 7.4) and stored in the dark at 4 °C (40Paromov V.M. Morton R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40859-40866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Oxidatively modified LDL was prepared as previously described (13Conway J.P. Kinter M. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1522-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Oxidative modification was assayed with the trinitrobenzene sulfonate assay of free amines, which typically resulted in 40% modified amines compared with 3% modified amines when LDL was dialyzed in TBS only.Cell Culture Conditions—J774A.1 murine macrophages were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC TIB 67) and maintained in culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were split every 2–3 days when ∼80% confluence was reached and discarded after 20 passages. siRNA Inhibition of Prx I—Approximately 5 × 105 cells were plated in 60-mm tissue culture-treated plates and left to adhere overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in normal culture media. For each 60-mm plate, 13 μl of siPORT Amine Transfection Reagent (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) was incubated with 200 μl of Opti-MEM reduced serum media for 10 min. Annealed double-stranded siRNA (20 μm stock) was added to a separate aliquot of 200 μl of Opti-MEM to give a final siRNA concentration of 30 nm. The transfection agent and the siRNA mixtures were combined and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Media in the 60 mm culture plates was changed to 4 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media plus 10% fetal calf serum only (no antibiotics), and the siRNA-transfection agent complexes were added dropwise. Transfection conditions were maintained for 16–24 h. The Prx I siRNA sequence, obtained from the online Ambion siRNA library (ID number 68674), targeted exon 4 and was as follows: sense, GGAUUAUGGAGUCUUAAAGtt; antisense, CUUUAAGACUCCAUAAUCCtg. Scrambled and reverse siRNA sequences were designed and used as negative controls. All siRNAs were obtained in lyophilized, annealed form, resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate double-distilled H2O to a stock concentration of 20 μm, and stored at –30 °C in 100-μl aliquots.Cell Toxicity Assay—Approximately 2 × 104 cells/well were seeded into 24-well tissue culture-treated plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For oxLDL-induced toxicity, cells were treated for up to 48 h with 10–100 μg/ml oxLDL. For tert-butyl hydroperoxide-induced toxicity, cells were treated with 10–200 μm tert-butyl hydroperoxide in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h, followed by a 48-h incubation in normal culture media. Cell survival was assayed with the Cell-Titer 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison, WI) as previously described (13Conway J.P. Kinter M. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1522-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Results were calculated from an average of three independent treatments, and experimental error is expressed as ±1 S.D.Flow Cytometric Assay of Reactive Oxygen Species—ROS were assayed using a Guava EasyCyte Flow Cytometer and the ROS-detecting agent CM-H2DCFDA. Lyophilized CM-H2DCFDA (50 μg) was suspended in Me2SO to a stock concentration of 1 mm and added to prewarmed Hanks' balanced salt solution without phenol red (HBSS) to a working concentration of 10 μm. Cells were washed with HBSS, covered with the CM-H2DCFDA/HBSS solution (typically 1.5 ml/well in a 6-well plate), and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 10 min. Cells not exposed to CM-H2DCFDA were included to assay the autofluorescent background initiated by experimental conditions. Following the CM-H2DCFDA incubation, the medium was removed, and cells were washed with HBSS and then harvested by scraping in 1 ml of HBSS, centrifuged at 1000 rpm in an Eppendorf Microfuge, and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then fixed in 3.7% formalin for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline for further analysis. For flow cytometric analysis, 5000 events were counted within the gate parameters for each sample. Acquisition parameters were as follows: forward gain, 2×; side scatter, 330 V; forward scatter threshold, 215 V; green channel, 552 V; red channel, 524 V; yellow channel, 533 V. Gate parameters were set as follows: X1 = 251, X2 = 2154, Y1 = 3857, and Y2 = 574. A 5000-count acquisition required ∼20 μl of sample and 30 s at a flow rate of 0.59 μl/s. Background fluorescence measured in cells without CM-H2DCFDA was subtracted from values obtained for the respective CM-H2DCFDA-treated samples. This background was most significant when assaying oxLDL-treated macrophages and ranged from 10 to 30% of the total measured fluorescence. The background for all other treatments was less than 10%. Results are normalized with respect to ROS measured in untreated control cells and expressed as relative n-fold change in ROS. Results were calculated from an average of three independent treatments, and experimental error is expressed as ±1 S.D.Two-dimensional Western Blot Analysis of Oxidized Prx I—Approximately 106 cells were seeded onto 100-mm tissue culture-treated plates and incubated overnight. Cells were treated with oxLDL, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, or an equivalent volume of buffer (20 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.8), incubated for a given time period, harvested by scraping in cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and washed once in sterile phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were boiled in SDS-lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% SDS) for 5 min, cooled to room temperature, and treated with 50 μg/ml DNase I and RNase A for 15 min. The protein concentration was determined using a SDS-compatible method (Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit), and 250 μg of total protein was precipitated in acetone (80%, v/v) overnight. The dried protein precipitate was prepared and analyzed by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE as previously described (13Conway J.P. Kinter M. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1522-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional gel was immediately incubated in Novex Tris-glycine transfer buffer plus 10% methanol for 10 min. The gel was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride in a Bio-Rad Criterion Gel Transfer Chamber for 1 h at 100 V, blocked in 2% nonfat dry milk, and incubated overnight at 5 °C in Prx I rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:2000). Western blots were completed with a 1-h incubation in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody, followed by enhanced ECL chemiluminescent detection. The membranes were stripped and reprobed with Prx I-SO2/-SO3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1000). All samples were analyzed in parallel by one-dimensional Western blot for GAPDH to confirm equal loading.p38 MAPK Inhibition—SB-203580 was used to inhibit p38 activity. SB-203580 (10 μm) was added to cell culture for 30 min prior to the experiment. An equivalent volume of anhydrous Me2SO was added to control cultures without SB-203580. The inhibitor was left in the culture for the duration of the experiment.RESULTSoxLDL Treatment Increases Prx I Expression—Previously, our group used a proteomic approach to study changes in protein expression that occur as macrophages become loaded with oxidized LDL to become foam cells (13Conway J.P. Kinter M. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1522-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel shown in Fig. 1A represents a typical set of protein bands observed from the J774 murine macrophages used in these experiments. The gel covers the pI range of 3–10 and was obtained from a whole cell homogenate. More detailed views of two such two-dimensional gels show a band with a significant increase in expression in the macrophages treated with 50 μg/ml oxLDL for 24 h (Fig. 1C) compared with untreated macrophages at the same time point (Fig. 1B). This band was cut from the gel, digested with trypsin, and identified by tandem mass spectrometry as Prx I (NCBI accession number 547923). The oxLDL-induced up-regulation of Prx I seen in the two-dimensional electrophoresis experiments was examined more closely by Western blot analysis. Fig. 2A shows that Prx I expression is not changed in macrophages left untreated or treated with native LDL (50 μg/ml) for 24 or 48 h. However, exposure of the macrophages to 50 μg/ml oxLDL results in a significant up-regulation of Prx I protein, with continued increases from 24 to 48 h. The oxLDL-induced up-regulation was also dose-dependent, increasing with oxLDL concentration over a range from 10 to 50 μg/ml oxLDL (Fig. 2B). Concentrations greater than 50 μg/ml could not be tested due to increasing toxicity of the treatment.FIGURE 2Western blot analysis of the time- and dose-dependent up-regulation of Prx I following exposure to oxLDL. A, J774 murine macrophages were left untreated (Ctl), or treated with 50 μg/ml LDL or oxLDL for 24 and 48 h. B, macrophages were treated with 0, 10, 25, or 50 μg/ml oxLDL for 24 h. In both A and B, protein was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody to Prx I (top) or mouse monoclonal antibody to GAPDH as a loading control (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Additional experiments were carried out to verify that the increase in Prx I was in a native (nonoxidized) form. Under certain oxidant-treatment conditions, the active site cysteine of Prx I can be overoxidized to a sulfinic (SO2) or sulfonic (SO3) acid, inactivating the reductase function of the enzyme (18Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Woo H.A. Hwang S.C. Chae H.Z. Kim K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38029-38036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The oxidatively inactivated forms of Prx I can be detected on a two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel by an acidic band shift associated with sulfinic or sulfonic acid formation at the affected cysteine residues or by an antibody specific to oxidized peroxiredoxin (Prx I–IV). Fig. 3 shows a combination of two-dimensional electrophoresis and Western blot analysis used to verify that the increased expression of Prx I results in the functionally active, nonoxidized form of the protein. For this experiment, the J774 macrophages were exposed to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH) (100 μm) or oxLDL (50 μg/ml) for 24 h. t-BOOH was chosen as a positive control based on its known ability to oxidize Prx I (41Rabilloud T. Heller M. Gasnier F. Luche S. Rey C. Aebersold R. Benahmed M. Louisot P. Lunardi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19396-19401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3Detecting the oxidative inactivation of Prx I by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE Western blot analysis. J774 murine macrophages were left untreated (Ctl)(A and D) or treated with 100 μm t-BOOH (B and E) or 50 μg/ml oxLDL (C and F) for 24 h. After oxidant exposure, macrophages were collected and prepared for two-dimensional SDS-PAGE separation. Two-dimensional gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and Western blot analysis was carried out using antibodies for Prx I (A–C) or oxPrx I (D–F). The three protein bands seen in each panel correspond to (from left to right) inactive Prx I (Cys-SO3 modification), inactive Prx I (Cys-SO2 modification), and active Prx I (unoxidized). The oxPrx I antibody is designed to detect both Cys-SO3 and Cys-SO2 modifications.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"

Here, we have investigated the target and mechanism of action of a cholesterol-binding compound, the polyene antifungal antibiotic amphotericin B methyl ester (AME). We found that AME potently inhibited the replication of a highly divergent panel of HIV-1 isolates in various T-cell lines and primary cells irrespective of clade or target cell tropism. The defects in HIV-1 replication caused by AME were due to profoundly impaired viral infectivity as well as a defect in viral particle production. To elucidate further the mechanism of action of AME, we selected for and characterized AME-resistant HIV-1 variants. Mutations responsible for AME resistance mapped to a highly conserved and functionally important endocytosis motif in the cytoplasmic tail of the transmembrane glycoprotein gp41. Interestingly, truncation of the gp41 cytoplasmic tail in the context of either HIV-1 or rhesus macaque simian immunodeficiency virus also conferred resistance to AME. The infectivity of HIV-1 virions bearing murine leukemia virus or vesicular stomatitis virus glycoproteins was unaffected by AME. Our data define the target and mechanism of action of AME and provide support for the concept that cholesterol-binding compounds should be pursued as antiretroviral drugs to disrupt HIV-1 replication.

Viral entry is initiated upon binding of the surface Env (envelope) glycoprotein gp120 to the CD4 receptor molecule on the target cell membrane. Following CD4 binding and interaction of gp120 with the coreceptor (generally CCR5 or CXCR4), conformational changes in gp120 and in the transmembrane Env glycoprotein gp41 lead to fusion of the virion lipid bilayer with the target cell plasma membrane (for review, see Ref. 1Doms R.W. Virology. 2000; 276: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This fusion event allows the viral nucleoprotein complex to enter the host cell and permits the establishment of a productive infection. Late in the replication cycle, viral assembly and release are directed by the Gag precursor protein Pr55Gag. During or immediately after particle release, Pr55Gag is cleaved by the viral protease to generate the mature infectious virion (2Freed E.O. Virology. 1998; 251: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Studies from our laboratory and others have suggested that specific cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains known as lipid rafts (3Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5149) Google Scholar) are involved in both early and late phases of the HIV-1 replication cycle (for review, see Refs. 4Campbell S.M. Crowe S.M. Mak J. J.

Med. 2004; 200: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) reported that statin treatment reduces viral loads in HIV-1-infected patients; this effect, however, was not observed in other studies (25Moncunill G.

AIDS. 2006; 20: 619-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Inconsistent effects of statin therapy on viral loads in vivo, together with the cytotoxicity associated with cyclodextrins, prompted us to examine the antiviral activity of other compounds that target cholesterol. To this end, we investigated the effect of amphotericin B methyl ester (AME) treatment on HIV-1 replication. This compound is a relatively non-cytotoxic derivative of the cholesterol-binding polyene antifungal antibiotic amphotericin B (28Brajtburg J. Bolard J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 9: 512-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AME has been shown in the past to be active against a variety of lipid-enveloped viruses, including HIV-1 (29Schaffner C.P. Plescia O.J.

In this study, we demonstrate the potent antiviral activity of AME against a wide range of HIV-1 isolates. We show that this compound inhibited both viral egress and entry. To understand further the mechanism of action of AME, we selected for, isolated, and characterized HIV-1 isolates that acquired AME resistance. Changes that conferred resistance to AME mapped to the cytoplasmic domain of the gp41 transmembrane Env glycoprotein. We further demonstrate that the infectivity of HIV-1 virions bearing either the amphotropic MLV Env glycoprotein or the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) were insensitive to AME. This study sheds light on the target and mechanism of action of AME and provides support for the development of cholesterol-binding compounds as antiretroviral drugs.

For nomenclature consistency, these mutants were renamed Y201A, Y201S, and Y201del, respectively.

Landau through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program of the National Institutes of Health. HIV-1 Env expression vectors pIIINL4env, pIIINL4envCTdel144-2, and pIIINL4envCTdel104 have been described previously (36Freed E.O. Martin M.A. J.

De Noronha C. Greene W.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1151-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) was a gift from W. Greene (University of California, San Francisco). Cells, Transfections, and Infections—Jurkat, CEMx174, MT-2, CEM(12D-7), and HeLa cell lines were maintained as described (45Kiernan R.E. Ono A. Englund G. Freed E.O. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4116-4126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were isolated and cultured as detailed previously (35Freed E.O. Englund G. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3949-3954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viral stocks were prepared by transfection and normalized for reverse transcriptase activity, and infections of T-cell lines, PBLs, and MDMs were performed as described (35Freed E.O. Englund G. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3949-3954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Kiernan R.E. Ono A. Englund G. Freed E.O. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4116-4126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the cultures treated with AME (generously provided by Karykion Corp., Princeton, NJ), the compound was present continuously. For luciferase-based, single-cycle infectivity assays, reverse transcriptase-normalized viral stocks were used to infect the CD4+/CXCR4+/CCR5+ HeLa cell derivative TZM-bl (obtained from J. Kappes through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program). This indicator cell line contains integrated copies of the β-galactosidase and luciferase genes under the control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (46Platt E.J. Wehrly K. Kuhmann S.E. Chesebro B. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2855-2864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Infection efficiency was determined by measuring luciferase activity 2 days post-infection as described (45Kiernan R.E. Ono A. Englund G. Freed E.O. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4116-4126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis and DNA Cloning—Molecular clones encoding gp41 amino acid substitution mutants P203L and S205L were constructed by QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene) using mutagenic oligonucleotides. 3Sequences are available upon request. The Env expression vectors pIIINL4env/P203L and pIIINL4env/S205L were constructed by cloning the 2.5-kb KpnI-XhoI fragment (pNL4-3 nucleotides 6343–8887) from pNL4-3/P203L or pNL4-3/S205L, respectively, into pIIINL4env. The reverse transcriptase- and Env-defective pNL4-3 derivative (pNL4-3/RT–/KFS) was constructed by cloning the SphI-SalI fragment (pNL4-3 nucleotides 1443–5785) from pNL4-3/RTD186N and the SalI-BamHI fragment (pNL4-3 nucleotide 5785–8465) from pNL4-3/KFS into the SphI-BamHI sites of pNL4-3. Viral Assembly and Release Assays—For metabolic radiolabeling assays, Jurkat cells were infected with high titer viral stocks pseudotyped with VSV-G, and HeLa cells were transfected with proviral DNA. Two days post-transfection or post-infection, cells were metabolically labeled for 2 h with [35S]Met/Cys. Preparation of cell lysates, pelleting of labeled virions in an ultracentrifuge, and immunoprecipitation of cell- and virion-associated proteins with HIV Ig (obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) have been described (47Freed E.O. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification was performed by PhosphorImager analysis, and viral release efficiency was calculated as the amount of virion-associated Gag as a fraction of total (cell- and virion-associated) Gag. Viral Entry and Env-induced Fusion Assays—To measure the efficiency of viral entry, HIV-1 virions containing the BlaM-Vpr chimeric protein were produced, and the virion-based fusion assay was conducted as described previously (44Cavrois M. De Noronha C. Greene W.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1151-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Briefly, Jurkat cells were incubated with virions containing BlaM-Vpr (50–500 ng of p24); the BlaM substrate CCF2-AM was loaded, and the BlaM reaction was allowed to develop for 12 h as described (44Cavrois M. De Noronha C. Greene W.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1151-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The cells were washed and fixed in 1.2% paraformaldehyde, and fluorescence was quantified at 447 nm (blue) and 520 nm (green) using excitation at 409 nm in a Fluoromax-3 fluorometer (Horiba). Fluorescence ratios were determined after subtracting the blue fluorescence of cells that were not infected with virus and the green fluorescence of cells that were neither infected nor loaded with CCF2-AM. Syncytium formation was monitored by transfecting TZM-bl cells with HIV-1 Env expression vector pIIINL4env, pIIINL4env/P203L, or pIIINL4env/S205L. After transfection, cells were treated or not treated with AME for 2 days, and syncytia were counted after staining the cells with a solution of methylene blue and pararosaniline (48Freed E.O. Myers D.J. Risser R. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4670-4675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Selection and Characterization of AME-resistant Viruses—AME-resistant isolates were selected by prolonged serial passage of wild-type (WT) pNL4-3 in Jurkat cells in the continual presence of an inhibitory concentration (10 μm) of AME. Viral DNA was prepared from cultures infected with putative AME-resistant virus using the QIAamp blood kit (Qiagen Inc.). The entire Gag and Env coding regions were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Putative resistance-conferring mutations were introduced into pNL4-3 by site-directed mutagenesis as described above. AME Inhibits HIV-1 Replication—To examine the potential anti-HIV-1 activity of AME, we monitored its effect on replication of the HIV-1 pNL4-3 clone in a range of cell types at varying concentrations of the compound. We observed that, in a number of human T-cell lines, 5 and 10 μm AME significantly inhibited HIV-1 replication (Fig. 1A–D). Cell viability was not significantly affected by treatment with 10 μm AME (data not shown). To extend this analysis to primary cell types that constitute natural targets for HIV-1 infection, we tested the replication of HIV-1 in primary human PBLs and MDMs. The replication of HIV-1 was blocked at AME concentrations of 5 and 10 μm in both PBLs and MDMs (Fig. 1, E and F). AME Inhibits an Early Stage of the HIV-1 Replication Cycle—To define the step in the HIV-1 replication cycle inhibited by AME, we carried out single-cycle infectivity assays in TZM-bl cells, a CD4+/CXCR4+/CCR5+ HeLa cell derivative that harbors a stably transfected luciferase reporter gene under the control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (46Platt E.J. Wehrly K. Kuhmann S.E. Chesebro B. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2855-2864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TZM-bl cells were infected with HIV-1 in the presence or absence of AME, and luciferase activity was measured 2 days post-infection. As shown in Fig. 2A, we observed a dose-dependent inhibition of viral infectivity, with concentrations above 4 μm reducing HIV-1 infectivity by >100-fold. To explore further the mechanism by which AME inhibits viral infectivity, we performed TZM-bl infectivity assays following AME treatment of the target cells, the virions, or both (Fig. 2B). We observed that pretreatment of the target cells had a minimal effect, whereas pretreatment of the virions severely inhibited infectivity. Treatment of both target cells and virions resulted in a level of inhibition that was similar to that observed upon treatment of virions alone. These results suggest that the primary target of AME inhibition is the virion, not the target cell membrane. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed a minimal effect of AME on cell-cell fusion (syncytium formation) in TZM-bl cells (data not shown). The inhibitory effect of AME on viral infectivity could result from either an entry or a post-entry defect. To define the step at which AME inhibition is imposed, we carried out viral entry assays (44Cavrois M. De Noronha C. Greene W.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1151-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of AME. In this assay, β-lactamase-Vpr (BlaM-Vpr) is packaged into virions. Upon fusion between the viral and target cell membranes, BlaM is delivered into the target cell cytoplasm, where it cleaves preloaded CCF2, a fluorogenic BlaM substrate. Cleavage of CCF2 can be detected by fluorometry. As indicated in Fig. 2C, AME inhibited viral entry in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that viral entry (the fusion between the viral and target cell membranes) is the major step at which AME inhibition is imposed. AME Disrupts HIV-1 Particle Production—The data presented in Fig. 2 indicate that AME potently inhibits early events in the HIV-1 replication cycle. Because AME is a cholesterol-binding compound and because we reported previously that cholesterol depletion significantly inhibits HIV-1 particle production (10Ono A. Freed E.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13925-13930Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), we determined whether AME might also disrupt a late stage of HIV-1 replication. Viral release assays were performed in the Jurkat T-cell line (Fig. 3, A and B) and in HeLa cells (data not shown). In both cell lines, viral release efficiency was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect of AME on viral production was independent of viral protease activity, as the release of virus-like particles produced by a protease-defective pNL4-3 derivative (pNL4-3/PR–) (37Huang M. Orenstein J.M. Martin M.A. Freed E.O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6810-6818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was also significantly reduced by AME (data not shown). Selection of AME-resistant Virus—The data presented thus far indicate that AME disrupts both early and late stages of the HIV-1 replication cycle, with effects on the early stages being particularly profound. To elucidate further the mechanism(s) by which AME interferes with HIV-1 replication, we sought to select for AME-resistant HIV-1 variants. We observed in Jurkat cells that AME markedly delayed viral replication (Fig. 4A). To determine whether the delayed viral replication was due to the emergence of AME-resistant viral variants, we repassaged virus obtained from the AME-treated Jurkat cultures in parallel with virus obtained from untreated cultures. We observed that the virus obtained from AME-treated cells replicated with comparable kinetics in the presence or absence of 10 μm AME. In contrast, the WT virus again showed a significant delay in replication in the presence of AME (Fig. 4B). The observation that the replication of virus obtained from AME-treated cultures was not inhibited by AME upon repassage indicated that this virus had acquired AME resistance. Characterization of AME-resistant Mutants—To identify the change(s) responsible for AME resistance, we amplified the Gag and Env coding regions by PCR using as a template HIV-1 genomic DNA from infected cells obtained from two independent AME selections. Upon DNA sequence analysis, no changes were observed in the gag gene. In env, two single amino acid changes were repeatedly observed in or adjacent to the YSPL motif in the membrane-proximal region of the gp41 cytoplasmic tail (P203L or S205L) (Fig. 5A). This motif has been implicated in endocytosis of Env from the plasma membrane through its binding to the clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex AP-2, basolateral targeting of Env in polarized epithelial cells, and polarized viral budding from a localized region of the lymphocyte plasma membrane (38Boge M.

Virol. 1999; 73: 5010-5017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the identified changes in gp41 conferred AME resistance, we constructed pNL4-3 derivatives containing the P203L and S205L substitutions. The replication kinetics of the mutants in PBLs were compared with those of the WT parental virus in both the presence and absence of AME. Interestingly, the replication kinetics of the P203L and S205L mutants were unaffected by AME (Fig. 5B), demonstrating that these mutations conferred AME resistance. To confirm that the P203L and S205L mutants were AME-resistant, we performed single-cycle infectivity assays in TZM-bl cells. The infectivity of the P203L and S205L mutants was reduced by only 20% in the presence of 4 μm AME during infection, whereas the infectivity of the WT virus was reduced by 50-fold (Fig. 5C). Treatment with 10 μm AME reduced the infectivity of P203L and S205L by only ∼2-fold, whereas the infectivity of WT pNL4-3 was reduced by >100-fold. These results establish that the P203L and S205L mutations confer resistance to AME. We also tested the P203L and S205L mutants in the BlaM viral entry assay. Consistent with their resistance to AME, entry of P203L and S205L mutant virions was not inhibited even at 10 μm AME, whereas entry of virions bearing WT Env was significantly reduced (data not shown). Particle production of the WT virus and the P203L and S205L mutants was reduced to a similar extent by treating virus-producing cells with 10 μm AME (data not shown). As mentioned above, the YSPL motif has been implicated in endocytosis of Env from the plasma membrane. Mutations in this motif, particularly substitution of Tyr at gp41 amino acid 201 (gp160 amino acid 712), have been shown to block AP-2 binding, to increase the levels of Env on the cell surface, and to increase Env-mediated syncytium formation (38Boge M.

It can make trimers and dimers through its N- and C-terminal G and E domains, respectively. Gephyrin oligomerization could thus create a submembrane lattice providing GlyR-binding sites. We investigated the relationships between the stability of cell surface GlyR and the ability of gephyrin splice variants to form oligomers. Using truncated and full-length gephyrins we found that the 13-amino acid sequence (cassette 5) prevents G domain trimerization. Moreover, E domain dimerization is inhibited by the gephyrin central L domain. All of the gephyrin variants bind GlyR β subunit cytoplasmic loop with high affinity regardless of their cassette composition. Coexpression experiments in COS-7 cells demonstrated that GlyR bound to gephyrin harboring cassette 5 cannot be stabilized at the cell surface. This gephyrin variant was found to deplete synapses from both GlyR and gephyrin in transfected neurons.

These data suggest that the relative expression level of cellular variants influence the overall oligomerization pattern of gephyrin and thus the turnover of synaptic GlyR. Fast neurotransmission at synapses depends on the enrichment of ionotropic receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. Scaffolding proteins present in the postsynaptic densities participate in the local and selective accumulation of most excitatory and inhibitory receptors in front of the corresponding transmitter release sites (1Craig A.M. Boudin H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 2Nusser Z. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Synaptic localization of clusters of inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid, type A and glycine receptors relies on gephyrin, initially discovered as a GlyR-associated extrinsic membrane protein (3Pfeiffer F.

Laube B. Stahl S. Muller U. Betz H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9289-9297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but its physical link with γ-aminobutyric acid, type A receptors is not yet understood. Gephyrin has a modular structure resulting from the fusion of two genes of bacterial origin, encoding the enzymes MogA and MoeA that catalyze the biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor in Escherichia coli (13Kamdar K.P.

Isolated G and E domains form stable trimers and dimers, respectively, implying that gephyrin has two distinct oligomerization potentials. If these properties were both conserved in the gephyrin molecule, then oligomerization would build up a two-dimensional hexagonal gephyrin lattice (18Xiang S. Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V.

Until now, studies aimed at characterizing interactions have mainly focused on the more abundant gephyrin variant (clone P1, 23), which harbors two cassettes (C2 and C6) of nine known to be alternatively spliced in rat. In a previous study (24Meier J. De Chaldee M. Triller A. Vannier C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 566-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we used in vitro assays of binding of gephyrin variants to the GlyR β subunit M3-M4 cytoplasmic loop to investigate the effect of gephyrin variability on receptor recognition. This had led us to suggest that the presence of a cassette in the gephyrin G domain alters conformation in the N-terminal domain of gephyrin and results in reduced β subunit binding. Such an effect remained to be explained, because of the exclusive binding ability of the E domain. Gephyrin homophilic interactions, which rely on the ability of the molecule to form trimers and dimers via distinct domains, are thought to account for the clustering of gephyrin-interacting GlyR in the postsynaptic membrane. Because of the variable primary structure of gephyrin, we investigated here the effect of the cassettes within splice variants on its dual function as scaffold protein for GlyR and in polymerization. We have designed novel molecular tools to analyze in vitro the GlyR binding properties of gephyrin and its oligomerization capability. We show that the cassette composition of gephyrin has no effect on a high affinity interaction with the β subunit, provided that its gephyrin-binding site is presented within a closed M3-M4 cytoplasmic loop. In contrast, we found that 1) trimerization of gephyrin can be impaired by the insertion of a defined cassette (cassette 5) in the G domain and 2) gephyrin trimerization correlates with the ability to stabilize GlyR at the cell surface. In cultured neurons, the incorporation of a trimerization-defective gephyrin molecule into the postsynaptic gephyrin polymer interfered with the presence of GlyR at synapses. Altogether, these results indicate that the relative cellular expression levels of gephyrin variants influence the overall oligomerization pattern of gephyrin, thereby controlling GlyR number at synapses.

In Vitro Binding Assays—Tagged gephyrin fragments and PH 3The abbreviations used are: PH, pleckstrin homology; ABTS, 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid; GlyR, glycine receptor; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase. chimeras in PBSM (5 mm β-mercaptoethanol in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) buffer were used immediately after elution from Ni-NTA-agarose. Two binding protocols were used. Solid phase binding assays (first protocol) were performed in ELISA plates. 96-Well microtiter plates (PVC plates; Costar) were coated with 50 μl/well of 60 nm PH or GST chimera solution in 0.1 m Na2CO3/NaHCO3, pH 9.6. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with BPBSM buffer (4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 0.25% (w/v) gelatin, 0.25% (v/v) Tween 20, 5% (w/v) milk in PBSM). Then, unless otherwise stated, gephyrin fragments were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C using 50 μl/well of solutions at concentrations specified in the figure legends. After washing, bound gephyrin was detected with either anti-Myc or anti-T7 (Novagen) tag-specific antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody. For quantitation, ABTS (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as substrate, and development was monitored in an ELISA reader (Bio-Tek). For solution assays (second protocol) of gephyrin protomer binding capacity, the tested fragments at the final concentration indicated in the figure legend were incubated in a final volume of 15 μl for 16 h at 4 °C in PBSMG buffer (PBSM containing 20% (w/v) glycerol). Then 50 μl of 12-fold dilutions of reaction mixes were incubated at 25 °C in Ni-NTA HisSorb strips (Qiagen) for capture. After washes with the same buffer, bound gephyrin species were detected separately with either anti-Myc, anti-T7, or anti-His6 (BD Biosciences Clontech) antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody as above. Calibration of tag reactivity (see Fig. 4) was performed in normal Ni-NTA HisSorb strips (Qiagen), except for T7mycGL (2) and T7mycLE, which were adsorbed to strips pretreated with 20 mm EDTA in 0.1 m Na2CO3/NaHCO3, pH 9.6. Cell Culture and Transfection—African green monkey kidney (COS-7) cells were plated on glass coverslips and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 7.5% CO2. For transfection, the experiments were performed on subconfluent cultures (60% confluency) using the FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) method. Usually, 2 μg of plasmid DNA were added to 35-mm dishes. Transient protein expression was allowed to proceed for up to 16 h at 37 °C. Spinal cord neurons were prepared from embryonic Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (28Meier J. Meunier-Durmort C. Forest C. Triller A. Vannier C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2783-2795PubMed Google Scholar). Routinely, the cells were plated at a density of 5.104 cells/cm2 onto glass coverslips (Assistent, Winigor, Germany) and grown in neurobasal medium supplemented with B27, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics (Invitrogen, France) at 36 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. They were transfected 8-10 days after plating using the Lipofectamine2000™ method (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were usually transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA in 20-mm wells. Fluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence labeling was performed essentially as described (31Rosenberg M. Meier J. Triller A. Vannier C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5036-5044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on cells that were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. The primary antibodies were used at the following concentrations: mouse anti-GlyR α1 subunit: 1 μg/ml (clone mAb2b; Synaptic System GmBH), mouse anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody: 0.5 μg/ml (clone 9E10; Roche Applied Science), rabbit anti-synapsin I antibody: 1 μg/ml (Chemicon), rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody: 1 μg/ml (clone 3F10; Roche Applied Science), rabbit anti-green fluorescent protein antibody: 1 μg/ml (BD Biosciences Clontech). The secondary antibodies were: goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate, Cy3 or Cy5 (1:250-1:400; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories), or Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes). Extracytoplasmic Myc tags were detected as described (31Rosenberg M. Meier J. Triller A. Vannier C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5036-5044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Observations were made using the 63×/1.32 and 100×/1.3 objectives of a Leica DMR fluorescence microscope. Fluorescence pictures were usually acquired with a Leica DMR/HCS microscope (63× immersion objective) (Nussloch, Germany) equipped with a CCD camera (Coolsnap; Princeton Instruments). Acquisition was done in black and white in 12-bit mode using appropriate filters, and quantification was done with Metamorph software (Princeton Instruments). GlyR and gephyrin clusters were quantified on digitalized images on neurons from two independent cultures. Integrated synaptic GlyR-associated fluorescence was measured on cells chosen randomly on the basis of Venus::Ge fluorescence. For each transfected neuron the GlyR-associated fluorescence intensity colocalized with synapsin I staining was measured on neurites using the gephyrin fluorescence as a mask, after subtraction of the background signal. All of the measurements were performed using Metamorph software. Statistical significance was determined by means of Student's t test using StatView Software (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). Fluorescence of clusters was determined on pictures acquired under a 100× objective lens. When required, pictures were pseudocolored with Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Endocytosis Test—The cells were incubated at 2 °C with 1 μg/m anti-c-Myc antibody for 30 min (prelabeling step) and then extensively washed (time 0 min of chase). They were returned to their initial culture medium pre-equilibrated at 37 °C to allow endocytosis for 40 min. Low pH stripping was then performed (time, 40 min of chase) by incubating cells at 2 °C in 0.2 m acetic acid, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 2.2, for 7 min. At any step, the cells were either processed for immunofluorescence staining or lysed for two-site ELISA. For two-site ELISA, washed and pelleted cells were solubilized in 50 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100, pH 8.0, for 30 min on ice. The cleared detergent extract was supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) gelatin, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and incubated for 18 h at 4 °C with rabbit anti-mouse antibody coated in 96-well microtiter plates (10 μg/ml, 50 μl/well). 9E10 IgG was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody and ABTS reaction as described above. Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography—Sephacryl S-200 (Amersham Biosciences) was packed in a 4.1-ml column (4.3 mm/27.5 cm) and equilibrated in PBSMG buffer at a flow rate of 24 μl/min. 30-μl samples of solutions (9-14 μm) of freshly eluted gephyrin fragments in PBSMG, GL (2), GL(2,4,5), G(2), G(2,5), E, and LE, were loaded onto the column within 5-10 min following elution from Ni-NTA-agarose. Fractions were collected in 96-well microplates, and proteins were adsorbed to nitrocellulose membrane in a 96-well dot-blot apparatus. The His6 tag was detected as described for binding assays, using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as horseradish peroxidase substrate. Dot density was determined after scanning of wet membrane using National Institutes of Health 1.52 software. The molecular mass standards used for the calibration of the column were catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (bovine serum albumin, 68 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and RNase A (13.7 kDa). Interaction of Gephyrin with GlyR Subunit M3-M4 Loops—The influence of the various domains and cassettes of gephyrin on its functional properties was analyzed with in vitro assays using recombinant proteins obtained after synthesis in E. coli and His6-mediated purification (Fig. 1). First, in an attempt to mimic their native conformation, we designed recombinant versions of GlyR cytoplasmic M3-M4 loops in which the N and C termini were brought close together. For this, the subunit loop sequences were substituted for the small loop connecting the anti-parallel β-strands 6 and 6′ in the cytohesin PH domain, which contributes to hydrogen bonding with 5-phosphate in inositol-(1,3,4,5) tetrakis-triphosphate (33Ferguson K.M.

The structure and stability of the PH domain are not altered by the insertion of the loop. 4S. Eimer, C. Bedet, and C. Vannier, unpublished results. These chimeras can be considered as displaying the loop in a restricted conformation, and the 18-amino acid gephyrin-binding sequence, βgb, should be properly displayed within the β loop (9Meyer G. Kirsch J. Betz H. Langosch D. Neuron. 1995; 15: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Second, a series of tagged, truncated forms of gephyrin in addition to full-length versions were constructed (Fig. 1) and used for binding experiments. The insertion of a tobacco etch virus protease (TEV) cleavage site in some constructs offered the possibility of investigating gephyrin protomer-protomer interactions in capture assays utilizing the His6 tag. The appropriate immunochemical reactivity of the sequence tags, as well as the efficiency of TEV digestion, was verified (supplemental Fig. S1). To characterize a possible differential binding of gephyrin-derived molecules (Fig. 1) to the cytoplasmic loop of the GlyR β subunit, the interaction of fragment LE was first compared with that of E, taken here as the reference binding entity. In the solid phase assay (first protocol, see “Experimental Procedures”) using immobilized PH-βLoop, maximal binding was reached after 3-4 h of incubation for both ligands and for all of the concentrations tested. In addition to the same kinetics, a saturable association of E and LE molecules to PH-βLoop was also described by superimposable curves (Fig. 2A). The same KD value in the nanomolar range was estimated for binding to PH-βLoop. In contrast, very little binding to GST-βLoop could be detected over this concentration range. A similar and high affinity interaction was also observed with the various LEi variants (Fig. 2B), indicating that none of the cassette sequences (C3, C4, and C4′) present in the L domain affect the recognition of PH-βLoop. Moreover, the association of full-length (GLE) molecules, when tested with identical ligand to PH-βLoop concentration ratios (Fig. 2C), revealed not only similar respective binding curves but affinities close, if not identical, to those of the corresponding LE fragment (Fig. 2, compare B and C). Therefore, PH-βLoop binding to the E domain was not influenced by either G domain, implying that cassette C5 of Ge(2,4,5) does not alter the high affinity interaction between gephyrin and the β loop. The GL construct, which contains neither the GlyR β subunit-binding site nor the E subdomains involved in protomer interface within the E dimer (18Xiang S. Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 299-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), could be used as a control. The curves of Fig. 2D confirmed that G domains had no binding ability whatever the variants tested. In this assay, no binding to the α1 loop or to the α2 loop occurred (Fig. 2, B and C). These data indicate that the formation of a high affinity complex with the GlyR β subunit cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop is not influenced by variations in the primary structure of gephyrin outside its E domain. In a previous work (24Meier J. De Chaldee M. Triller A. Vannier C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 566-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we showed that a differential β loop binding of gephyrin variants could be measured using GST pull-down assays. In an attempt to better characterize the effect of the structure surrounding the βγβ gephyrin-binding sequence of β loop, we probed the association of Ge(2,4,5) and Ge(2) with PH-βLoop, GST-βLoop, and PH-α1βγβLoop using the solid phase assay. As observed with E and LE, the strength of the Ge/GST-βLoop complex was strikingly low as compared with that of Ge/PH-βLoop (supplemental Fig. S2A). However, in contrast to the interaction between gephyrins and PH-βLoop, the distinct ability of the two gephyrin variants to bind GST-βLoop (as exhibited in GST pull-down assays), was reproduced here, because Ge(2) could be captured more efficiently than Ge(2,4,5) by immobilized GST-βLoop (supplemental Fig. S2A, inset). This difference was not observed when βγβ was inserted in the PH-α1βγβLoop chimera, which binds gephyrin as strongly as PH-βLoop (supplemental Fig. S2B). This suggests that structural elements promoting gephyrin recognition are maintained in the PH-M3-M4 loop proteins and lost in GST-βLoop. PH domain-based carriers of the βγβ sequence thus provide high affinity binding sites for both gephyrin variants. The present results (Fig. 2C) demonstrate that gephyrins Ge(2,4,5) and Ge(2) bind with similar affinities to PH-βLoop. Furthermore, we show that high affinity binding to βγβ is dependent on structural elements that are only maintained in a closed M3-M4 loop conformation. Size Exclusion Chromatography of Gephyrin Fragments—We then investigated whether cassette composition could affect the quaternary structure of the molecule. Based on reports from others (19Sola M. Bavro V.N. Timmins J. Franz T. Ricard-Blum S. Schoehn G. Ruigrok R.W. Paarmann I. Saiyed T. O'Sullivan G.A. Schmitt B. Betz H. Weissenhorn W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2510-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the more stable oligomeric state of purified fulllength gephyrin (GLE) is a trimer behaving as a 300-kDa assembly, in agreement with the crystal structure of the G domain (16Schwarz G. Schrader N. Mendel R.R. Hecht H.J. Schindelin H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 405-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 17Sola M. Kneussel M. Heck I.S. Betz H. Weissenhorn W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25294-25301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) but suggesting that the E domain does not possess a conformation suitable for dimerization. Here, only the truncated gephyrin versions were used, potentially able to form either trimers or dimers. Polypeptides were analyzed immediately after purification to minimize self-aggregation. Size exclusion chromatography of fragments corresponding to Ge(2,4,5) and Ge(2) and detected by dot-blotting is illustrated (Fig. 3A). The elution profiles obtained for G(2) and GL(2) were consistent with those of homogeneous trimers with peaks at 81 and 178 kDa, respectively (Fig. 3B). This was not the case for G(2,5) and GL(2,4,5), mainly eluted at volumes nearly corresponding to the size of the monomers (peaks at 27 and 60 kDa, as compared with 25.9 and 55.8 kDa, respectively). This demonstrated a lack of trimer formation by the G domain of Ge(2,4,5). A striking difference was also observed in the behavior of the E and LE fragments. E, which is a dimer at concentrations in the micromolar range (20Schrader N. Kim E.Y. Winking J. Paulukat J. Schindelin H. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18733-18741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), was indeed recovered in a single peak (123 kDa), consistent with the size of the dimerized polypeptide (50.2 kDa/monomer). In contrast, LE was recovered as two distinct entities: predominantly a monomeric form (68 kDa, predicted: 65.8) and a dimer (145 kDa), clearly eluting ahead of the E dimer. This result suggested that the L domain does not favor the formation of an LE dimer. These results indicate that trimer formation by the G domain of gephyrin can be prevented by the insertion of cassette C5 and support the notion that E domain dimerization is impeded by the L linker domain. Gephyrin Oligomer Formation via the G and E Domains—Interactions between either G or E domains of gephyrin were analyzed using a solution assay (second protocol, see “Experimental Procedures”). This assay was designed to measure the potential exchange of protomers between oligomeric forms of gephyrin at equilibrium. Briefly, His-tagged (capture molecules) and Myc-tagged (ligand molecules) fragments of gephyrin (Fig. 1A) were coincubated (at concentrations in the micromolar range), prior to binding to Ni-NTA-coated wells of ELISA plates. The epitope tags associated with the wells were assayed, and the recovery of the Myc tag was taken as the indication of capture and ligand molecule association.

Toca-1 has three functional domains: an F-BAR/EFC domain at the N terminus, an HR1 at the center, and an SH3 domain at the C terminus. The F-BAR/EFC domain induces tubular invagination of plasma membrane, while Toca-1 binds both N-WASP and Cdc42 through the SH3 domain and the HR1, respectively. However, the physiological role of Toca-1 is completely unknown. Here we have investigated the neural function of Toca-1. Toca-1 is strongly expressed in neurons including hippocampal neurons in developing brain at early times. Knockdown of Toca-1 in PC12 cells significantly enhances neurite elongation. Consistently, overexpression of Toca-1 suppresses neurite elongation through the F-BAR/EFC domain with a membrane invaginating property, suggesting an implication of membrane trafficking in the neural function of Toca-1. In addition, knockdown of N-WASP, to our surprise, also enhances neurite elongation in PC12 cells, which is in clear contrast to the previous report that dominant negative mutants of N-WASP suppress neurite extension in PC12 cells. On the other hand, knockdown of Toca-1 in cultured rat hippocampal neurons enhances axon branching a little but not axon elongation, while knockdown of N-WASP enhances both axon elongation and branching.

Rho family GTPases are implicated in morphological changes of various cells by reorganizing actin cytoskeleton (1Negishi M. Katoh H. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Among them, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 have been extensively investigated. In neurons, Rac and Cdc42 stimulate neurite extension, whereas Rho triggers growth cone collapse and neurite retraction.Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) 3The abbreviations used are: WASP, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein; N-WASP, Neural WASP; F-BAR/EFC, Fer/CIP4 homology (FCH) and BAR (Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs)/extended Fer/CIP4 homology; VCA, verprolin-homology, cofilin-homology, and acidic; GBD, GTPase-binding domain; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PCH, pombe Cdc15 homology; HR1, protein kinase C-related kinase homology region 1; SH3, Src homology 3; WIP, WASP-interacting protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; siRNA, short interfering RNA; DIG, digoxigenin; NGF, nerve growth factor; DIV, day(s) in vitro; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; nt, nucleotides. 3The abbreviations used are: WASP, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein; N-WASP, Neural WASP; F-BAR/EFC, Fer/CIP4 homology (FCH) and BAR (Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs)/extended Fer/CIP4 homology; VCA, verprolin-homology, cofilin-homology, and acidic; GBD, GTPase-binding domain; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PCH, pombe Cdc15 homology; HR1, protein kinase C-related kinase homology region 1; SH3, Src homology 3; WIP, WASP-interacting protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; siRNA, short interfering RNA; DIG, digoxigenin; NGF, nerve growth factor; DIV, day(s) in vitro; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; nt, nucleotides. family members play essential roles in actin polymerization and have been much studied as a link between Rho family and actin cytoskeleton (2Miki H. Takenawa T. J. Biochem. 2003; 134: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). WASP family members are characterized by their C-terminal VCA region (for verprolin homology (V) region, cofilin-homology (C) region, and acidic (A) region). They bind to both G-actin through the V region and Arp2/3 complex through the CA region, and activate Arp2/3 complex. The activated Arp2/3 complex nucleates de novo actin filaments and forms branched actin filament network. Five WASP family members have been described in mammals: WASP, N-WASP (Neural WASP), and three WASP-family verprolin-homologous (WAVE) proteins.Among WASP family proteins, N-WASP is well known for its role in various actin reorganization processes, such as Cdc42-induced filopodia formation in fibroblasts (2Miki H. Takenawa T. J. Biochem. 2003; 134: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In the inactive state, N-WASP is in a closed form by an intramolecular interaction between the GTPase-binding domain (GBD) and the VCA region, therefore the VCA region is masked. Cdc42, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and several SH3 domain-containing proteins including Grb2/Ash, Nck, and WISH bind to N-WASP through the GBD, the basic region and the proline-rich domain, respectively. Their binding unfolds inactive N-WASP and thereby activates N-WASP. The exposed VCA region activates Arp2/3 complex, stimulating actin polymerization through de novo actin nucleation (2Miki H. Takenawa T. J. Biochem. 2003; 134: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 3Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1299-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Thus, N-WASP acts as an integrator of multiple signaling pathways to direct actin polymerization (2Miki H. Takenawa T. J. Biochem. 2003; 134: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Indeed, an N-WASP mutant, which has a deletion in the cofilin homology (C) region and is impaired in its ability to activate Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin nucleation, reportedly suppresses neurite extension in PC12 cells and primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons (5Banzai Y. Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11987-11992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), by working as a putative dominant negative mutant. It has also been reported that another putative dominant negative mutant of N-WASP, which has a mutation in the GBD and is unable to bind to Cdc42, also suppresses neurite extension in PC12 cells (5Banzai Y. Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11987-11992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Ho et al. (6Ho H.Y. Rohatgi R. Lebensohn A.M. Ma L. Li J. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2004; 118: 203-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) have recently reported that Toca-1 (transducer of Cdc42-dependent actin assembly) is necessary for Cdc42 to activate N-WASP from biochemical experiments. Toca-1 is a member of PCH (pombe Cdc15 homology) family proteins and has three functional domains: an F-BAR/EFC domain (for Fer/CIP4 homology (FCH) and BAR (Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs)/extended Fer/CIP4 homology domain) at the N terminus, an HR1 (protein kinase C-related kinase homology region 1) at the center, and an SH3 domain at the C terminus. The N-terminal F-BAR/EFC domain of PCH family proteins binds directly to phosphatidylserine and PIP2, and thereby induces tubular invagination of the plasma membrane (7Kamioka Y. Fukuhara S. Sawa H.

Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Toca-1 binds both N-WASP and Cdc42 through the SH3 domain and the HR1, respectively (6Ho H.Y. Rohatgi R. Lebensohn A.M. Ma L. Li J. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2004; 118: 203-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). N-WASP forms a complex with WASP-interacting protein (WIP) in intracellular environment. WIP regulates N-WASP by recruiting N-WASP to sites where actin assembly occurs (10Martinez-Quiles N. Rohatgi R. Anton I.M. Medina M. Saville S.P. Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Takenawa T. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Ramesh N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Toca-1 was shown to promote actin nucleation by activating N-WASP-WIP complex in response to Cdc42 in vitro (6Ho H.Y. Rohatgi R. Lebensohn A.M. Ma L. Li J. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2004; 118: 203-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Direct binding of Toca-1 to Cdc42 and N-WASP was shown to be required for this function of Toca-1, because both an SH3 mutant of Toca-1, Toca-1-K, and an HR1 mutant of Toca-1, Toca-1-IST failed to activate Cdc42-induced actin assembly (6Ho H.Y. Rohatgi R. Lebensohn A.M. Ma L. Li J. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2004; 118: 203-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Toca-1-K with a conserved tryptophan in the SH3 domain mutated to lysine fails to bind to N-WASP, whereas Toca-1-IST with three conserved residues (MGD) in the HR1 substituted with IST is significantly impaired in its ability to bind to Cdc42 (6Ho H.Y. Rohatgi R. Lebensohn A.M. Ma L. Li J. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2004; 118: 203-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, the physiological role of Toca-1 is completely unknown.Here we studied neuronal function of Toca-1 because we found that Toca-1 is strongly expressed in developing neurons. Knockdown and overexpression experiments in PC12 cells showed that Toca-1 negatively regulates neurite elongation through the F-BAR/EFC domain. The F-BAR/EFC domain induces plasma membrane invagination (8Itoh T. Erdmann K.S. Roux A. Habermann B. Werner H. De Camilli P. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 791-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), suggesting an implication of membrane trafficking in neurite elongation. Surprisingly, knockdown of N-WASP also enhances neurite elongation in PC12 cells, which is in clear contrast to the previous report using dominant negative mutants of N-WASP (5Banzai Y. Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11987-11992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, knockdown of Toca-1 in cultured rat hippocampal neurons enhances axon branching a little but not axon elongation, whereas knockdown of N-WASP enhances both axon elongation and branching. These results suggest that Toca-1 regulates different aspects of neuronal morphology from N-WASP probably through regulation of vesicle trafficking.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructions and Antibodies—Rat Toca-1 was cloned as described previously (11Kakimoto T. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14104-14110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) using RT-PCR with rat brain RNA as a template. cDNAs encoding the full-length Toca-1L (amino acids 2-609), Toca-1S (amino acids 2-551), Toca-1L-K576 (amino acids 2-609), Toca-1L-IST (amino acids 2-609), Toca-1L-ΔC (amino acids 2-371), Toca-1L-ΔN (amino acids 389-609), and Toca-1L-QQ (amino acids 2-609) were subcloned into expression vector pCMV (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) encoding an initiating Met followed by the Myc epitope tag or enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) sequence at the N terminus. cDNAs encoding the full-length RapostlinL (amino acids 2-620), and RapostlinS (amino acids 2-559) were subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), encoding an initiating Met followed by the Myc epitope tag sequence at the N terminus. Rat N-WASP cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. T. Takenawa (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan), and subcloned into pCMV-HA (Clontech). pCAG encoding enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) was a generous gift from Drs. J. Miyazaki (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) and T. Saito (Chiba University, Chiba, Japan). The target sequences used for short interfering RNA (siRNA) are as follows: Toca-1 siRNA-A, nucleotides 61-79, GGAATTGACTTCTTGGAAA; Toca-1 siRNA-B, nucleotides 1782-1800, AGATGTAACTCTAGAGAAA; Toca-1 siRNA-C, nucleotides 1358-1376, AGACCATGAATAACATTGA; N-WASP siRNA-A, nucleotides 95-115, GCAAGAAATGTGTGACTATGT; N-WASP siRNA-B, nucleotides 119-137, CAGCAGTGGTGCAGTTATA, and they were expressed using an siRNA expression vector pSilencer (Ambion, Austin, TX). As a control we used a nonspecific pSilencer vector encoding an siRNA sequence not found in the rat or human genome in BLAST search provided by the manufacturer as described previously (12Oinuma I. Ishikawa Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. Science. 2004; 305: 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar).An antibody against Toca-1 was raised against a bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase-fused peptide corresponding to the amino acid residues 489-526 of Toca-1L (SDINHLVTQGRESPEGSYTDDANQEVRGPPQQHGHHSE). The specific antibody against Toca-1 was purified with a peptide (CANQEVRGPPQQHGHHS, the amino acid residues 510-525 of Toca-1L)-conjugated affinity column. The following antibodies were purchased from commercial sources: a mouse monoclonal antibody against Myc (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), mouse monoclonal antibodies against β-actin and α-tubulin (Sigma), a rat monoclonal antibody against HA (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland), and a mouse monoclonal antibody against green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (11Kakimoto T. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14104-14110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were separated by SDS-10% PAGE and were electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked with 3% low fat milk in Tris-buffered saline and then incubated with primary antibodies. The primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) and a chemiluminescence detection kit.Preparation of Rat Tissue Homogenates—Various tissues of Wistar rats were homogenized with a Teflon homogenizer in homogenizing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.32 m sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm benzamidine, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) as described previously (13Ishikawa Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11065-11072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The homogenates were lysed with Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting.RT-PCR—To investigate the expression of Toca-1 spicing variants, RT-PCR was performed from various postnatal day 8 (P8) rat tissues using a pair of primers, 5′-cgcaaagttatccccatcat-3′ and 5′-gagccatgcctcattcttgt-3′.In Situ Hybridization—Antisense and sense riboprobes for rat Toca-1 (nt 351-821) were synthesized and digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled by in vitro transcription with T7 and T3 RNA polymerases and DIG RNA labeling mix (Roche Applied Science) from EcoRI-, XhoI-digested pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) plasmid. In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (13Ishikawa Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11065-11072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Katoh H. Fujimoto S. Ishida C. Ishikawa Y. Negishi M. Brain Res. 2006; 1073: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30-40 μm-thick coronal or sagittal sections of P1 or embryonic day 18 (E18) rat brains were treated with 0.5 μg/ml proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) for 3-5 min at room temperature. The sections were then acetylated in acetic anhydride/triethanolamine-HCl for 10 min before hybridization. After prehybridization, the sections were incubated overnight at 55 °C with 500-1000 ng/ml DIG-labeled sense or antisense probe. The sections were then washed in 2× SSC at 55 °C three times for 1 h each. DIG-labeled probes were immunodetected using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody against DIG (Roche Applied Science) and then reacted with chromogenic substrates, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium.Cell Culture and Transfection—293T cells and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml of streptomycin under humidified air containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. 293T cells (1 × 106 cells) cultured on 60-mm culture dishes were transfected with test plasmids using Lipofectamine plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HeLa cells (3 × 104 cells) cultured in 24-well plates on glass coverslips (circular, 13 mm in diameter) were transfected with test plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml of streptomycin under humidified air containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. PC12 cells cultured in 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 onto poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips (circular, 13 mm in diameter) were transfected with test plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PC12 cells were differentiated with 50 ng/ml of nerve growth factor (NGF) (Promega, Madison, WI) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 44 h after the transfection and then fixed.Hippocampal cultures were prepared from the hippocampi of E19 rats as described previously (13Ishikawa Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11065-11072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampi of Wistar rat embryos were dissected in ice-cold calcium- and magnesium-free HBSS. The hippocampi were washed in HBSS and incubated in HBSS with 0.25% trypsin and 0.1% DNase for 10-15 min at 37 °C. After the incubation, the hippocampi were washed in HBSS, followed by trituration with Pasteur pipettes. The cells were seeded onto poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips (circular, 13 mm in diameter) at a density of 2 × 104 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml of streptomycin and cultured under humidified air containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After 5 h, the medium was replaced with Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) with 2% B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 0.5 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml of penicillin and cultured under humidified air containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For immunofluorescence analyses, hippocampal neurons were transfected with test plasmids at 1 day in vitro (1 DIV) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and fixed at 4 DIV. For immunoblot analyses, hippocampal neurons were cultured on poly-d-lysine-coated 60-mm culture dishes, and transfected with test plasmids using Rat Neuron Nucleofector kit (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Twenty-four hours after the transfection, HeLa cells on coverslips were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min and mounted in 90% glycerol containing 0.1% p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride in PBS. Cells with membrane tubulation were counted as described previously (8Itoh T. Erdmann K.S. Roux A. Habermann B. Werner H. De Camilli P. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 791-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 9Tsujita K. Suetsugu S. Sasaki N. Furutani M. Oikawa T. Takenawa T. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Briefly, a cell that had at least one tubulation of overexpressed Toca-1 or its mutant was counted as a cell with membrane tubulation.PC12 cells and primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After residual paraformaldehyde had been quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and incubated with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 30 min. Cells were incubated with the antibody against Toca-1 in PBS for 1 h followed by incubation with an Alexa 594-conjugated goat antibody against rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in PBS for 1 h. Cells on coverslips were mounted in 90% glycerol containing 0.1% p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride in PBS. The cells were photographed with a Leica (Nussloch, Germany) DC350F digital camera system equipped with a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) Eclipse E800 microscope and analyzed with Image-Pro Plus image analysis software (Media Cybernetics).For quantification of neurite elongation in PC12 cells, cells with neurites were defined as cells that possessed at least one neurite longer than twice the diameter of the cell body as described previously (5Banzai Y. Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11987-11992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 12Oinuma I. Ishikawa Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. Science. 2004; 305: 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 15Katoh H. Negishi M. Nature. 2003; 424: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Axon length and branching in hippocampal neurons were quantified manually as described previously (16Szebenyi G. Callaway J.L. Dent E.W. Kalil K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7930-7940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using Image-Pro Plus image analysis software (Media Cybernetics). Briefly, one neurite that was immunostained with a mouse monoclonal antibody against Tau-1 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) was analyzed as an axon for each neuron. And, only processes longer than 20 μm from axon branch points were counted as axon branches.RESULTSToca-1 Is Strongly Expressed in Brain—When we performed RT-PCR from rat brain to clone a rat ortholog of Toca-1, we found that Toca-1 has a splicing variant (Fig. 1A, panel a). Cloning and sequence analysis of the variant showed that this longer variant has an insertion of 58 residues, which we named as the insert region, between the F-BAR/EFC domain and the HR1. Therefore, we renamed Toca-1 as Toca-1S, and named the longer variant as Toca-1L. We have previously reported that Rapostlin/formin-binding protein 17 (FBP17; hereafter referred to as Rapostlin), a Toca-1 paralog, also has two splicing variants with and without the insert region between the F-BAR/EFC domain and the HR1: RapostlinL and RapostlinS, respectively (11Kakimoto T. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14104-14110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Fujita H. Katoh H. Ishikawa Y. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The conserved splicing pattern suggests that the presence of the insert region may make a functional difference.To characterize Toca-1, we raised an antibody against a peptide, corresponding to the amino acid residues 489-526 of Toca-1L and purified with a peptide, corresponding to the amino acid residues 510-525 of Toca-1L, which is a unique sequence of Toca-1 compared with the close paralog, Rapostlin (6Ho H.Y.

Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The antibody recognized both of the Toca-1 splicing variants overexpressed in 293T cells and did not cross-react with Rapostlin (Fig. 1B). The specificity of the antibody was further supported by the result of the immunocytochemistry (Fig. 3C) and immunoblotting (Fig. 6B) of Toca-1 siRNA-transfected cells.FIGURE 3Effect of knockdown of Toca-1 or N-WASP on neurite elongation in PC12 cells.

The transfected cells are shown by the fluorescence of EYFP (EYFP, left panels). Cells transiently transfected with nonspecific siRNA or the Toca-1 siRNA were stained with the antibody against Toca-1 (Toca-1, middle panels). Note that Toca-1 immunoreactivity is faint in cells transfected with Toca-1 siRNA-A, or -B (arrowheads in panels b and c) compared with surrounding untransfected cells. In contrast, Toca-1 immunoreactivity is unaffected in cells transfected with nonspecific siRNA or Toca-1 siRNA-C (arrowheads in panels a and d). The superposition of left (green) and middle (red) images is shown in right panels (Merged) for these cells. Note that red-green overlap leads to yellow in merged images. Scale bars, 10 μm. D, quantification of the effect of knockdown of Toca-1 or N-WASP on neurite elongation in PC12 cells. PC12 cells transiently transfected with one of the indicated siRNA vectors together with a plasmid encoding EYFP were differentiated with NGF for 44 h. Cells with neurites were defined as cells that possessed at least one neurite longer than twice the diameter of the cell body and results were scored as a percentage of the number of the transfected cells. Results are the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments in which more than 100 cells were counted.

https://openalex.org/W2011735185,"Mutations in Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) can cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) through mechanisms proposed to involve SOD1 misfolding, but the intracellular factors that modulate folding and stability of SOD1 are largely unknown. By using yeast and mammalian expression systems, we demonstrate here that SOD1 stability is governed by post-translational modification factors that target the SOD1 disulfide. Oxidation of the human SOD1 disulfide in vivo was found to involve both the copper chaperone for SOD1 (CCS) and the CCS-independent pathway for copper activation. When both copper pathways were blocked, wild type SOD1 stably accumulated in yeast cells with a reduced disulfide, whereas ALS SOD1 mutants A4V, G93A, and G37R were degraded. We describe here an unprecedented role for the thiol oxidoreductase glutaredoxin in reducing the SOD1 disulfide and destabilizing ALS mutants. Specifically, the major cytosolic glutaredoxin of yeast was seen to reduce the intramolecular disulfide of ALS SOD1 mutant A4V SOD1 in vivo and in vitro. By comparison, glutaredoxin was less reactive toward the disulfide of wild type SOD1. The apo-form of A4V SOD1 was highly reactive with glutaredoxin but not SOD1 containing both copper and zinc. Glutaredoxin therefore preferentially targets the immature form of ALS mutant SOD1 lacking metal co-factors. Overall, these studies implicate a critical balance between cellular reductants such as glutaredoxin and copper activation pathways in controlling the disulfide and stability of SOD1 in vivo. Mutations in Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) can cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) through mechanisms proposed to involve SOD1 misfolding, but the intracellular factors that modulate folding and stability of SOD1 are largely unknown. By using yeast and mammalian expression systems, we demonstrate here that SOD1 stability is governed by post-translational modification factors that target the SOD1 disulfide. Oxidation of the human SOD1 disulfide in vivo was found to involve both the copper chaperone for SOD1 (CCS) and the CCS-independent pathway for copper activation. When both copper pathways were blocked, wild type SOD1 stably accumulated in yeast cells with a reduced disulfide, whereas ALS SOD1 mutants A4V, G93A, and G37R were degraded. We describe here an unprecedented role for the thiol oxidoreductase glutaredoxin in reducing the SOD1 disulfide and destabilizing ALS mutants. Specifically, the major cytosolic glutaredoxin of yeast was seen to reduce the intramolecular disulfide of ALS SOD1 mutant A4V SOD1 in vivo and in vitro. By comparison, glutaredoxin was less reactive toward the disulfide of wild type SOD1. The apo-form of A4V SOD1 was highly reactive with glutaredoxin but not SOD1 containing both copper and zinc. Glutaredoxin therefore preferentially targets the immature form of ALS mutant SOD1 lacking metal co-factors. Overall, these studies implicate a critical balance between cellular reductants such as glutaredoxin and copper activation pathways in controlling the disulfide and stability of SOD1 in vivo.

Enzyme catalysis is carried out by the copper co-factor, and in cells, this copper ion is delivered to SOD1 through regimented metal trafficking pathways. One pathway involves the CCS copper chaperone (2Culotta V.C. Klomp L. Strain J. Casareno R. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol.

Although the precise copper donor in this case is not understood, the CCS-independent pathway shows a dependence on glutathione and is particularly sensitive to certain perturbations in the SOD1 structure (6Carroll M.C. Girouard J.B. Ulloa J.L. Subramaniam J.R. Wong P.C. Valentine J.S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5964-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 7Jensen L.T.

Specifically, prolines at SOD1 positions 142 and 144 (based on Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human SOD1) will block activation by the CCS-independent pathway but not by CCS. S. cerevisiae SOD1 naturally contains these prolines and shows total dependence on CCS (2Culotta V.C. Klomp L. Strain J. Casareno R. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23469-23472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). SOD1 molecules from higher organisms generally lack prolines 142 and 144 and can be activated independent of CCS (6Carroll M.C. Girouard J.B. Ulloa J.L. Subramaniam J.R. Wong P.C. Valentine J.S.

How CCS-independent activation is blocked by prolines 142 and 144 is uncertain, but these residues have been proposed to disrupt the monomer-dimer equilibrium of apoSOD1 (8Banci L. Bertini I.

Although SOD1 is normally a protective enzyme, dominant mutations throughout the SOD1 polypeptide have been linked to the fatal motor neuron disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The underlying mechanism is incompletely clear, but a well accepted model involves misfolding of SOD1 mutants and consequential accumulation of toxic SOD1 aggregates (9Cleveland D.W. Liu J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1320-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 10Valentine J.S. Hart P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2645-2649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with purified enzyme indicate that the bound metal co-factors as well as an intramolecular disulfide in SOD1 help stabilize the structure of the SOD1 homodimer, and this is true for both wild type (WT) and ALS mutant polypeptides (13Assfalg M.

During disease, loss of the intramolecular disulfide correlates with misfolding of mutant SOD1 (19Jonsson P.A. Graffmo K.S. Andersen P.M. Brannstrom T. Lindberg M. Oliveberg M. Marklund S.L. Brain. 2006; 129: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and formation of improper intermolecular disulfides helps aggregate the protein (20Deng H.X. Shi Y. Furukawa Y. Zhai H. Fu R. Liu E. Gorrie G.H. Khan M.S. Hung W.Y. Bigio E.H. Lukas T. Dal Canto M.C. O'Halloran T.V. Siddique T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As such, the cellular factors that promote faithful oxidation of the correct intrasubunit disulfide in SOD1 should promote SOD1 stability. Very little is known regarding the cellular factors that impact on the disulfide of human SOD1. O'Halloran and co-workers (23Furukawa Y. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) found that in the case of yeast SOD1, Cu-CCS promotes oxidation of the disulfide. The role of the CCS-independent pathway in oxidizing the disulfide of metazoan SOD1 has not been addressed previously. Without copper activation, the disulfide cysteines may be reduced, as was shown for yeast SOD1 in vivo (23Furukawa Y. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar); however, the thiol reductants that promote this process are unknown. The low redox potential of the cytosol should favor cysteine reduction. Additionally, the thiol oxidoreductases thioredoxin and glutaredoxin (GRX) are known to target a limited number of cysteines in polypeptides (24Fernandes A.P. Holmgren A. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2004; 6: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 25Carmel-Harel O. Storz G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 439-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). GRX can resolve mixed disulfides between GSH and a polypeptide cysteine (an S-thionylated polypeptide) (24Fernandes A.P. Holmgren A. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2004; 6: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 26Shelton M.D. Chock P.B. Mieyal J.J. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2005; 7: 348-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and can also directly reduce intramolecular disulfides in proteins without an S-thionylated intermediate. Such reduction of intramolecular disulfides has been described for Escherichia coli Grx1 (24Fernandes A.P. Holmgren A. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2004; 6: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 27Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 28Zheng M. Aslund F. Storz G. Science. 1998; 279: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). But to date, no intramolecular disulfide target has been described for the GRXs of eukaryotes. Could SOD1 represent such a target? Here we describe cellular factors that control the status of the SOD1 disulfide in vivo. By using a yeast expression system, we find that in addition to CCS, the CCS-independent pathway for copper activation helps oxidize the disulfide of human SOD1. When both pathways are blocked, the SOD1 disulfide cysteines are reduced, and in the case of ALS SOD1 mutants A4V, G93A, and G37R, the protein is highly unstable and is subject to degradation. We also demonstrate for the first time that cytosolic glutaredoxins (GRX) can reduce the SOD1 disulfide cysteines and thereby affect stability of certain ALS SOD1 mutants.

Strains 614 and 4347 are ccs1Δ::kanMX4 and grx2:: kanMX4 isolates from BY4741 (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). MC105 (grx2::kanMX4 ccs1Δ::LEU2) was generated by disrupting the CCS1 gene in strain 4347 using plasmid pLJ165 (6Carroll M.C. Girouard J.B. Ulloa J.L. Subramaniam J.R. Wong P.C. Valentine J.S.

For most biochemical analyses, 50 ml of yeast cells were propagated overnight at 30 °C in either minimal synthetic dextrose (SD) selecting media (starting A600 = 0.15) or in enriched YPD (yeast extract, peptone, dextrose) medium (starting A600 = 0.05). In studies with methionine repression, overnight cultures were diluted in a volume of 200 ml to an ≈A600 = 0.6 and allowed to grow for an additional 2 h to early log phase. 1 mm methionine was then added, and aliquots of 50 ml were harvested at various time points for cell lysis. Plasmids pLC1, pLC2, and pLC3 (2μ URA3) express WT, A4V, and G41D human SOD1 under the control of S. cerevisiae PGK1 (31Corson L.B. Strain J. Culotta V.C. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The S142P/L144P substitution was also introduced in the LEU2 CEN plasmid pLS121 expressing human SOD1 under S. cerevisiae SOD1 (7Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41373-41379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), creating pMS001. pLS121 and pMS001 were used as templates to introduce ALS mutations A4V, G37R, and G93A. Plasmids pLC41 and pLC42 (2μ TRP1) express WT and A4V human SOD1 under the methionine-repressible S. cerevisiae MET25 promoter (31Corson L.B. Strain J. Culotta V.C. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

For expression of Grx2p in yeast, the S. cerevisiae GRX2 gene was amplified with primers that introduced BamHI and SalI sites at –962 and +987 and inserted at these same sites in either pRS413 (HIS3 CEN), creating pCO147, or pRS414 (TRP1 CEN), creating plasmid pVCO147. For expression in E. coli, GRX2 was amplified without the mitochondrial targeting signal (residues 1–34) (32Pedrajas J.R. Porras P. Martinez-Galisteo E. Padilla C.A. Miranda-Vizuete A. Barcena J.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 617-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from pCO147 using primers that introduced an NdeI site at Met-35 and a BamHI site 15 bp after the stop codon. The fragment was inserted at the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET21a (Novagen), creating pCO150. Purification of Recombinant Yeast Grx2p and Human SOD1—For production of recombinant Grx2p, E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) transformed with plasmid pCO150 was grown in 5 liters of LB media and induced for 2.5 h with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside when the A600 reached 0.7. Harvested cells were stored at –80 °C. A frozen cell paste equivalent to ∼800 ml of cell culture was lysed by freezingthawing and resuspended in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm DTT. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and proteins were precipitated with 65–90% (NH4)2SO4 followed by resuspension in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT to a final volume of ∼3 ml. The protein solution was desalted using a Hi-Trap™ desalting column (GE Healthcare) and then loaded onto a Hi-Trap™ Q-Sepharose XL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm DTT. Recombinant Grx2p was eluted with 0–50 mm NaCl and concentrated to 37 mg/ml (3.1 mm). Protein purity was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (supplemental Fig. S3A). Protein was stored at –80 °C with 5% glycerol added to the buffer. This recombinant Grx2p was found to efficiently catalyze the reduction of 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide (HED) by GSH with activity (∼300 units/mg protein) comparable with E. coli Grx1 (33Holmgren A. Aslund F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar).

Purity of these proteins was demonstrated by a single band on SDS-PAGE and are of the correct mass as demonstrated by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using a Sciex API III triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).

The latter study further verified the purity of wild type and pathogenic SOD1 proteins isolated in this fashion by using reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography immediately prior to mass spectrometric analysis. By inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, WT and A4V SOD1 contained equal amounts of copper and zinc in the copper-binding site and only zinc in the zinc-binding site (36Strange R.W.

Biochemical Assays—4-Acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS) was used to monitor the disulfide status of SOD1. Yeast cells from a 50-ml culture were washed twice in deionized water, and a 100-μl cell pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of a GdnHCl buffer (6 m guanidine-HCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3) that contained, as needed, 15 mm AMS (Molecular Probes). 100 μl of glass beads (425–600 μm; Sigma) were added and cells lysed by three cycles of vortexing at room temperature for 2 min, interspersed by 1-min incubations on ice. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the dark. A 50-μl aliquot was then applied to a MicroSpin G-25 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), and 32 μl of flow-through was prepared for SDS-PAGE by incubating with SDS-DTT loading buffer at room temperature for 7 min, followed by quick clarification by centrifugation. For AMS modification of SOD1 from fibroblasts, cells were plated at a density of 6.67 × 105 cells per 100-mm tissue culture dish and cultured for 24 h at 37 °C. Media were aspirated, and cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by cell lysis through addition of 200 μl of GdnHCl buffer (see above) containing, as needed, 15 mm AMS. The AMS reaction and subsequent gel filtration proceeded as above. 20 μl of column flow-through was boiled in SDS-DTT gel loading buffer and clarified by centrifugation prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE on 14% precast gels (Invitrogen). Immunoblotting with fibroblasts used an antibody (1:1000 dilution) that only recognizes human SOD1 (6Carroll M.C. Girouard J.B. Ulloa J.L. Subramaniam J.R. Wong P.C. Valentine J.S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cross-reactivity with nonspecific yeast products of ≈39 and ≈69 kDa was occasionally observed with early preparations of the antibody (e.g. see supplemental Fig S1A), but not with later preparations of higher titer (e.g. see Fig. 5A). Standard immunoblots (no AMS) and native gels for SOD1 activity used 30–50 μg of yeast cell lysate protein. In nonreducing gels (as in Fig. 5A), the gel was pre-soaked in tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) according to published methods (21Furukawa Y. Fu R. Deng H. Siddique T. O'Halloran T.V. Proc.

SOD1 activity was monitored by native gel electrophoresis on 12% precast gels and by nitro blue tetrazolium staining as described (40Flohe L. Otting F. Packer L. Methods in Enzymology: Oxygen Radicals in Biological Systems. 105. Academic Press, New York1984: 93-104Google Scholar, 41Schmidt P.J. Ramos-Gomez M. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36952-36956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). GRX activity of yeast cell lysates was monitored by the HED assay (33Holmgren A. Aslund F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Yeast cells grown to confluency in selecting media were subjected to glass bead lysis. Cell lysates were heated at 85 °C to inactivate glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase (42Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). 15 μg of cell lysate protein was added to a 1-ml quartz cuvette containing a 300-μl HED reaction mixture (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2.0 mm EDTA, 1 mm GSH, 0.4 mm NADPH, 6 μg/ml glutathione reductase, and 0.7 mm HED). GRX reduction of the HED substrate was measured by continuous monitoring of NADPH consumption at 340 nm over a range of 2 min. An in vitro assay for reduction of the human SOD1 disulfide by recombinant Grx2p was carried out in a 300-μl reaction containing the aforementioned GRX assay constituents with 0.2 mm NADPH rather than 0.4 mm NADPH and no HED. 2–3 μm purified human SOD1 with an oxidized disulfide was added as substrate, and following the addition of recombinant Grx2p to a concentration of 0.05 μm, the reaction was incubated at 30 °C. At specific time points, 10-μl aliquots were mixed with 60 μl of GdnHCl buffer (see above) containing 15 mm AMS. Following incubation for 1 h at 37°C, samples (≈100 ng of SOD1) were subject to gel filtration and analysis of SOD1 by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. It is noteworthy that in certain preparations of recombinant SOD1, thiol modification at Cys-111 was incomplete. For example, human WT SOD1 (purchased from Sigma) showed no AMS reactivity at Cys-111 unless pretreated with reducing agents. Apparent oxidation at Cys-111 was also observed upon storage (>2 weeks at 4 °C or >6 months –70 °C) of apo but not metallated A4V and G93A human SOD1. Similar problems with Cys-111 have been reported elsewhere (35Di Noto L. Whitson L.J. Cao X. Hart P.J. Levine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39907-39913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 43Liu H. Zhu H. Eggers D.K. Nersissian A.M. Faull K.F. Goto J.J. Ai J. Sanders-Loehr J. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8125-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As such, it is important to carry out analysis of the disulfide with freshly prepared samples of purified apoSOD1. The Disulfide in Human SOD1 Is Oxidized by Both the CCS-dependent and -independent Pathways for Copper Loading—We sought to understand how copper trafficking pathways affect the disulfide of human SOD1. Disulfide status was probed by AMS, which forms stable thioether linkages with free polypeptide cysteines, but is nonreactive toward cysteines bridged in a disulfide. Unlike S. cerevisiae SOD1 and the Cu,Zn-SOD of Caenorhabditis elegans that contain only two cysteines (7Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41373-41379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), human SOD1 contains four cysteines as follows: the disulfide Cys-57 and Cys-146 cysteines, and Cys-6 and Cys-111. To discern between these, we introduced single and combined mutations at these cysteines. The corresponding SOD1 variants were expressed in yeast, and lysates prepared in 6 n guanidinium were treated with AMS and analyzed by immunoblot. The goal of such a “redox Western” is not to determine total protein levels but to compare the level of oxidized versus reduced cysteines within a particular sample. Typically, the 15.9-kDa human SOD1 migrates on SDS gels at the position of ≈21.5 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 1) (44Borchelt D.R. Guarnieri M. Wong P.C. Lee M.K. Slunt H.S. Xu Z. Sisodia S.S. Price D.L. Cleveland D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3234-3238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). When WT SOD1 from CCS1+ yeast is reacted with AMS, a major band corresponding to a shift in mobility of ≈5.0 kDa is observed (Fig. 1, thin arrow, lane 2). This reflects AMS modification at the nondisulfide Cys-6 and Cys-111 cysteines, because no mobility shift is observed with C6S/C111S SOD1 expressed in CCS1+ yeast (Fig. 1, lane 5). The lack of AMS reactivity at Cys-57 and Cys-146 demonstrates that the disulfide is oxidized in CCS1+ yeast cells, as would be expected for active SOD1. It is noteworthy that AMS modification at Cys-6 and Cys-111 produces a larger shift in mobility than the 1.07 kDa expected for two AMS moieties. This is due to AMS modification at Cys-111, because C6S SOD1, but not C111S, also produces an aberrantly large shift in mobility (Fig. 1B, also see supplemental Fig. S1B and Tables S1 and S2). Certain small modifications in SOD1 composition can effect anomalous mobility on SDS gels, such as the C57S mutation (Fig. 1A, lane 11) and several other sub"

There were indications that pancreatic juice also contains enzymes that could hydrolyze ATP during its passage through the ductal system. The aim of this study was to determine which ATP-degrading and possibly ATP-generating enzymes were present in pancreatic secretion. For this purpose, pancreatic juice was collected from anesthetized rats stimulated with infusion of CCK-8. Purine-converting activities in juice samples were assayed by TLC using either [γ-32P]ATP or 14C/3H-labeled and unlabeled nucleotides as appropriate substrates. Data show that the juice contains the enzyme ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase that can hydrolyze both [14C]ATP and [3H]ADP about equally well, i.e. CD39. Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis additionally shows that this enzyme has broad substrate specificity toward other nucleotides, UTP, UDP, ITP, and IDP. In addition, secretion contains ecto-5′-nucleotidase, CD73, further converting [3H]AMP to adenosine. Along with highly active hydrolytic enzymes, there were also ATP-generating enzymes in pancreatic juice, adenylate kinase, and NDP kinase, capable of sequentially phosphorylating AMP via ADP to ATP. Activities of nonspecific phosphatases, nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases, and adenosine deaminase were negligible. Taken together, CCK-8 stimulation of pancreas causes release of both ATP-consuming and ATP-generating enzymes into pancreatic juice. This newly discovered richness of secreted enzymes underscores the importance of purine signaling between acini and pancreatic ducts lumen and implies regulation of the purine-converting enzymes release.

This newly discovered richness of secreted enzymes underscores the importance of purine signaling between acini and pancreatic ducts lumen and implies regulation of the purine-converting enzymes release. Extracellular ATP and other purines mediate signaling between cells by means of neural transmission, paracrine, and autocrine effects. There are several important steps in this purinergic cascade including release of ATP, interaction with specific P2 purinergic receptors on the target cells, and not the least, ATP-degrading and -converting enzymes, which determine the balance between nucleotides and nucleosides and thus activation of P2 versus P1 (adenosine) receptors. Extracellular nucleotides can be hydrolyzed by a number of enzymes, such as ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases from the NTPDase 2The abbreviations used are: NTPDase, ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase; NPP, ecto-nucleoside pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase; NDPK, nucleotide diphosphate kinase; CCK-8, cholecystokinin octapeptide; –BIC, bicarbonate-free physiological saline; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography.

Ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases (NPP) have broad substrate specificity and can convert ATP to AMP and PPi (2Goding J.W. Grobben B. Slegers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1638: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Ecto-5′-nucleotidases (CD73) further hydrolyze AMP to adenosine, which can be taken up into the cell by specific Na+-dependent nucleoside transporters or converted into inosine by adenosine deaminase. Ecto-alkaline phosphatases have broad action and dephosphorylate 5′-tri-, di-, and monophosphates. In addition to these degradation and inactivation pathways, there are also counteracting ATP-generating pathways, which include reverse nucleotide transphosphorylation by adenylate kinase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK). These kinases, which play roles in intracellular signaling and in DNA and RNA synthesis among others, are also expressed on surfaces of different cell types and can contribute to nucleotide balance (3Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Jalkanen S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In cardiovascular system and in respiratory epithelia, a number of enzymes handling nucleotides are well characterized. In human blood, soluble NPP, 5′-nucleotidase, and adenosine deaminase, as well as adenylate and NDP kinases, contribute to “cleanup” of circulating nucleotides and adenosine (4Yegutkin G.G. Samburski S.S. Jalkanen S. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), particularly of prothrombotic ADP, which is released from platelets and would otherwise, via P2Y12 receptor, cause further platelet activation and hemostasis (5Dorsam R.T. Kunapuli S.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells have high activities of CD39 and CD73 (3Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Jalkanen S.

In contrast, the lymphoid cells are generally characterized by a counteracting, ATP-regenerating, and adenosine-eliminating phenotype (8Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Samburski S.S. Spychala J. Jalkanen S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) Upon adhesion, the lymphocytes inhibit endothelial ecto-5′-nucleotidase and prevent adenosine formation, thus facilitating their transmigration into the tissue (9Henttinen T. Jalkanen S. Yegutkin G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24888-24895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Airway epithelia release ATP constitutively and in response to mechanical stimulation, and all adenine nucleotides and nucleosides are detected in airway surface liquid (10Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31061-31068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In these epithelia, it seems that the P2Y2 receptor is of central importance, and its stimulation leads to improvement of the mucociliary clearance by stimulation of ciliary beat frequency, Cl– and fluid secretion, and mucin secretion from goblet cells. Nucleotide levels are regulated by a number of enzymes especially active on the apical surface of various airway epithelial cell lines. These include both ATP-degrading enzymes, NPP, CD73, and alkaline phosphatase, and ATP-generating enzymes, NDPK and adenylate kinase (10Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol.

In exocrine glands, ATP and other purines are thought to be important regulators of salt and fluid transport (13Novak I. News Physiol. Sci. 2003; 18: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It seems that pancreatic acini have relatively few functional P2 receptors (14Novak I. Nitschke R. Amstrup J. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2002; 12: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, nucleotide- and nucleoside-selective receptors may be important regulators in pancreatic ducts, which secrete bicarbonate-rich fluid. In rat pancreas, ATP is released from acini into the series of excurrent ducts that are rich in P2 receptors. Close to acini, the ATP concentrations are in the high micromolar range; however, low amounts of ATP are detected in the final pancreatic juice collected from the main duct (15Sørensen C.E. Novak I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32925-32932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 16Sørensen C.E. Amstrup J. Rasmussen H.N. Ankorina-Stark I. Novak I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 551: 881-892Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). CD39 is expressed in pancreatic acini and also pancreatic ducts of rats and pigs, as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and histochemistry (16Sørensen C.E. Amstrup J. Rasmussen H.N. Ankorina-Stark I. Novak I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 551: 881-892Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 17Kittel A. Pelletier J. Bigonnesse F. Guckelberger O. Kordas K. Braun N. Robson S.C. Sevigny J.

Physiol. 1998; 275: G473-G482PubMed Google Scholar). Our recent study revealed that pancreatic juice also contains CD39. Relatively low levels of ADP and AMP in the juice indicated that other enzymes may be present in the juice (16Sørensen C.E. Amstrup J. Rasmussen H.N. Ankorina-Stark I. Novak I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 551: 881-892Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To understand the acino-ductal paracrine regulation, it is important to determine which ecto-enzymes are present in pancreatic secretions and thus estimate the prevalence of nucleotides versus nucleosides. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine nucleotide/nucleoside-converting enzymes secreted in pancreatic juice collected under in vivo stimulation of rat pancreas with CCK-8. To determine the whole spectrum of purine-converting enzymes in pancreatic juice, we employed TLC assay with 3H/14C-labeled nucleotide substrates, autoradiography of direct 32Pi transfer from [γ-32P]ATP, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of NTP metabolism. The obtained data clearly demonstrate that pancreatic juice contains ATP-consuming enzymes, CD39 and CD73, as well as ATP-generating enzymes, adenylate kinase and NDPK. We propose that they have a role in purinergic signaling between pancreatic acini and pancreatic ducts. Materials—Hormones secretin and CCK-8 were obtained from Sigma. Tissue culture media and phosphate-buffered saline were from Invitrogen. Mebumal was from Nycomed (Roskilde, Denmark). [2-3H]AMP (specific activity 24 Ci/mmol), [8-14C]ATP (57 mCi/mmol), and [2-3H]adenosine (24 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Biosciences (Little Chalfont, UK). [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [2,8-3H]ADP (27.5 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. TLC plates were Alugram SIL G/UV254, and Polygram CEL 300 polyethyleneimine types were supplied by Macherey-Nagel (Duren, Germany). Synergi Hydro-RP 80A HPLC column (4-μm, 150 × 4.6 mm) protected by a reverse-phase C18 guard cartridge were from Phenomenex (Torrance, CA). All other reagents and standard chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Collection of Pancreatic Juice—The necessary permission for animal experiments was obtained from the Danish Animal Ethical Committee. In vivo collection of pancreatic juice was undertaken on female Wistar rats weighing 160–300 g. The animals, fasted overnight, were anesthetized with mebumal (pentobarbital, 40 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). Anesthesia was maintained during the experiments by additional, intravenous injections of mebumal. The body temperature of animals was maintained at 38 °C by means of a thermostatically controlled heating. The animals were tracheostomized, and the facial vein was cannulated for infusions. The abdomen was opened by a midline incision, and the pylorus and the proximal ends of the bile duct were ligated. The common pancreatic bile duct was cannulated with an ∼2-cm-long polyethylene tube, and collection of pancreatic juice was started with a control period of 30–60 min during which medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 1000/Ham's F12 medium) was infused into the facial vein. Secretion was then stimulated by infusion CCK-8 (5.6 pmol/min/200 g of animal), for about 60 min. The infusion rate (0.03 ml/min/animal) was held constant with a syringe pump (Cole-Parmer). Pancreatic juice was collected on ice over 10–15-min periods and stored at –80 °C or on dry ice for transport. Blood was collected in heparinized syringes, and plasma was separated by centrifugation. After experiments, animals were killed by overdose of mebumal. For estimations of ATP in pancreatic juice, 5–10-μl samples were quickly thawed and immediately assayed with an SL kit using internal and external standards according to the manufacturer's instructions (BioThema, Haninge, Sweden). Luminescence was detected in a FLUOstar Optima microtiter plate reader (BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany). Preparation of Pancreatic Acini—Acini were prepared by collagenase digestion as described earlier (15Sørensen C.E. Novak I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32925-32932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). After filtering through nylon mesh, cells were gently washed in physiological HCO3--free buffer (–BIC) of the following composition (in mmol/liter): 145 Na+, 3.6 K+, 1.5 Ca2+, 1 Mg2+, 145 Cl–, 2.0 phosphate, 5 glucose, and 10 HEPES. Finally, cells were suspended in –BIC solution, and 50-μl aliquots were pipetted into 96-well microtiter plates followed by 50 μl of luciferin/luciferase mix HSII (Roche Diagnostics, Manheim, Germany), which was dissolved in –BIC. Acini were allowed to rest for 45–60 min, but most of them did not attach to substrate. Subsequently, luminescence was monitored after injection of 5-μl volumes of –BIC and CCK-8 made up in –BIC. Luminescence was monitored in 1-s intervals in the microtiter plate reader. Temperature was 25 °C to slow down ATP hydrolysis by enzymes. ATP standards were treated as samples, and standard curves were constructed for each experiment. Under the given experimental conditions, ATP standards gave stable luminescence signals. ATP release monitored in arbitrary luminescence units was recalculated as ATP concentration and corrected for 1 million cells/ml. Cell numbers were estimated by cell counting and from cellular ATP freed following cell lysis. Protein Measurement—Total protein concentration in pancreatic juice was determined by using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). HPLC Analysis of Nucleotide Metabolism—Pancreatic juice (1.5–2 μl, ∼250 μg of protein) was incubated with 20 μm ITP/UTP in a final volume of 300 μl of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.4 mm MgCl2. Aliquots of the mixture (100 μl) were collected at the beginning (zero point) and after a 60-min incubation at 37 °C, and nucleotides were extracted by adding 20 μl of 4 m perchloric acid. After centrifugation, the supernatant was adjusted to neutral pH by 4 n KOH (∼28 μl), clarified again by centrifugation, and stored at –70 °C. The samples (20 μl) were then injected onto a Synergi Hydro-RP 80A column and separated by reverse-phase HPLC as described previously (4Yegutkin G.G. Samburski S.S. Jalkanen S. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Measurement of Purine-converting Activities in Pancreatic Juice—Nucleotide-converting activities were determined by incubating 1 μl of juice samples (150–200 μg of protein) for 45–60 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 80 μl of RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mm β-glycerophosphate in the following ways. (i) For evaluation of ATPase activity, juice was incubated with 300 μm [14C]ATP. (ii) ADPase was assayed with 300 μm [3H]ADP in the presence of adenylate kinase inhibitor Ap5A (50 μm). (iii) 5′-Nucleotidase activity was measured with 300 μm [3H]AMP. (iv) For adenylate kinase and NDPK activities, the assay medium contained 300 μm [3H]AMP or [3H]ADP as respective phosphate acceptors and 800 μmol/liter γ-phosphate-donating ATP/NTP. In the case of time-dependent studies, juice was incubated with 20 μm tracer nucleotides in a starting volume of 120 μl of RPMI 1640, and aliquots of the mixture were periodically applied onto Alugram sheets. Radiolabeled nucleotide substrates and their products were separated by TLC, visualized in UV light, and quantified by scintillation β-counting, as described earlier (3Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Jalkanen S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Likewise, for measurement of adenosine deaminase, juice was incubated with 300 μm [3H]adenosine for 60 min, and the amount of generated [3H]inosine/hypoxanthine was quantified by TLC using an appropriate solvent mixture (4Yegutkin G.G. Samburski S.S. Jalkanen S. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Autoradiographic Analysis of [γ-32P]ATP Metabolism by Pancreatic Juice—Samples (50 μg of protein) were incubated for 40 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 60 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 2 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 μm ATP with tracer [γ-32P]ATP, and 250 μm unlabeled nucleotides. Aliquots of the mixture were spotted onto Polygram sheets, separated by TLC with 0.75 mol/liter KH2PO4 (pH 3.5), and developed by autoradiography. Data Presentation—Data are presented as original recordings and summaries showing the mean values ± S.E. Data were analyzed in Origin (Microcal Software, Inc). From isolated preparations of pancreatic acini and ducts, we have learned that in response to cholinergic stimulation, pancreatic acini secrete ATP (15Sørensen C.E. Novak I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32925-32932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This ATP might be destined for the adjoining pancreatic ducts, which express functional P2 receptors (see the Introduction). In the present study, we wished to determine whether similar signaling functions with the classical acinar agonist CCK-8, both at the acinar cell level and at the whole organ level. In the first series of experiments, ATP release was monitored in situ in a suspension of pancreatic acini. In the first part of the recording in Fig. 1A, one can observe that mechanical disturbance caused by pump injection of –BIC results in a small ATP release. Repeated injection of –BIC has no further effect (results not shown). However, injection of CCK-8 (10–11 m) resulted in a transient increase in ATP. The peak agonist-induced ATP release is expressed per 1 million cells/ml (Fig. 1B). The decay in the ATP signal was most likely due to the presence of enzymes hydrolyzing ATP since ATP standards gave sustained luminescence signal under our conditions. In addition, supernatant collected from acinar incubation medium was able to degrade ATP standards, similar to what we have also seen with whole pancreas juice (see below). Next we studied pancreatic secretion of intact pancreas stimulated to secrete with CCK-8, which when infused at 5.6 pmol/min/200 g of animal, would be 10–11 to 10–10 m in the interstitium. Fig. 1C shows the secretory response of rat pancreas with time and ATP concentrations in pancreatic juice. Pancreatic juice collected from cannulated common pancreatic bile duct was analyzed for ATP, and the concentrations were 4.5 ± 1.2 nmol/liter (n = 7) (Fig. 1D). These ATP concentrations are higher than detected earlier, most likely due to improved techniques for juice collection (16Sørensen C.E. Amstrup J. Rasmussen H.N. Ankorina-Stark I. Novak I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 551: 881-892Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 19Kordas K.S. Sperlagh B. Tihanyi T. Topa L. Steward M.C. Varga G. Kittel A. Pancreas. 2004; 29: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, ATP concentrations in juice are significantly lower than estimated from acini preparations. In fact, if we assume that all acinar cells that comprise the bulk of pancreatic tissue would release ATP into the juice, then disparity between proximal and distal ATP concentrations would be even larger. We postulated that the diminished ATP levels as secretion progressed from acini through the whole duct tree were indicative that the pancreatic juice also contained ATP-hydrolyzing enzymes. Therefore, pancreatic juice was collected between 60 and 80 min of stimulation, when secretion was well established, not contaminated by bile and possible cellular debris from cannulation processes. The collected samples were used for enzyme analysis, which was the primary focus of this study. Fig. 2 shows the time courses of hydrolysis of 20 μm [14C]ATP by pancreatic juice (Fig. 2A) and formation of its dephosphorylated 14C metabolites (Fig. 2B). Gradual decay in ATP concentration was accompanied by an immediate rise in AMP and, after a time lag, there was progressive production of adenosine. [14C]ADP level did not exceed 7–9% of the initially introduced substrate. After 75 min of [14C]ATP incubation with juice samples, most of the metabolites appeared as [14C]AMP. Notably, there was no further deamination of [3H]AMP-derived [3H]adenosine into [3H]inosine/hypoxanthine, indicating the absence of soluble adenosine deaminase activity in our juice samples (also see Fig. 6A).FIGURE 6Purine-converting activities in rat pancreatic juice. A, nucleotide hydrolase and adenosine deaminase activities (ADA) were determined by incubation of juice samples with nearly saturating (300 μm) concentrations of radiolabeled nucleotides and adenosine as preferable enzyme substrates. 5-NT, 5′-nucleotidase. B, the counteracting NDPK and adenylate kinase (AK) activities were assayed by juice co-incubation with 300 μm [3H]ADP or [3H]AMP as respective phosphate acceptors and 800 μm γ-phosphate donating ATP/NTP. The ordinate shows specific enzyme activities expressed as nmol of tracer nucleotide substrates inactivated (A) or phosphorylated (B) by mg of juice protein per hour (mean ± S.E.; n = 3–6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Little ADP formation in the assay medium may be explained either by immediate breakdown of the ATP-derived ADP via high NTPDase activity or, alternatively, due to direct ATP conversion into AMP through NPP reaction. Nevertheless, the latter suggestion seems highly unlikely for the following reasons. Firstly, in the presence of 300 μm unlabeled ADP, hydrolysis of 20 μm [14C]ATP by juice samples was markedly diminished (Fig. 2A), suggesting that ADP and ATP compete for the same catalytic site of NTPDase. Secondly, Fig. 3 unequivocally shows that pancreatic juice directly converts [γ-32P]ATP to 32Pi, without any detectable formation of 32PPi. This indicates that ATP-hydrolyzing activity in pancreatic juice is mainly represented by NTPDase rather than NPP. EDTA eliminated this nucleotidase reaction (lane 7), showing the Ca2+-Mg2+ dependence of NTP-Dases. Upon incubation of [γ-32P]ATP with AMP or nucleotide diphosphates GDP and UDP, there was a slight generation of [32P]ADP and [32P]NTPs, respectively (lanes 3–5), indicating that pancreatic juice also contains adenylate kinase and NDPK, which transfer [γ-32P]. Adenylate kinase inhibitor, Ap5A, inhibited 32Pi transfer from ATP to AMP (lane 4). The levels of nonspecific phosphatases were also negligible as similar patterns of [14C]ATP hydrolyzes were observed with and without the excess of alternative phosphorylated substrate, β-glycerophosphate (data not shown). For further evaluation of the nucleotidase substrate specificity, pancreatic juice was incubated with 20 μm ITP or GTP, and the reaction products were separated by reverse-phase HPLC. Clearly, significant portions of ITP (Fig. 4A) and UTP (Fig. 4B) were hydrolyzed into respective nucleoside di- and monophosphates after a 60-min incubation, showing the broad specificity of pancreatic nucleotidase for various NTPs and NDPs. The pattern of subsequent nucleotide hydrolysis by juice samples was then evaluated with 3H-labeled ADP and AMP as initial tracer substrates, and the results are shown in Fig. 5. Pancreatic juice progressively hydrolyzed [3H]ADP into [3H]AMP/adenosine, and this catalytic reaction was markedly attenuated in the presence of 300 μm ATP (Fig. 5, A and B). The addition of [3H]AMP to pancreatic juice was also accompanied by its gradual hydrolysis to [3H]adenosine through 5′-nucleotidase reaction (Fig. 5C). Unlabeled ATP efficiently blocks the [3H]AMP hydrolysis, presumably due to feed-forward inhibition of 5′-nucleotidase activity and/or concurrent activation of backward phosphotransfer reactions (3Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Jalkanen S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Quantitative radio-TLC analysis of pancreatic purine-converting enzymes was then performed using saturated concentrations of radiolabeled and unlabeled nucleotides/adenosine, and these results are summarized in Fig. 6. The data show the ability of rat pancreatic juice to efficiently hydrolyze [3H]ADP and to about a similar extent as [14C]ATP. Pancreatic juice also efficiently hydrolyzes [3H]AMP by means of the 5′-nucleotidase activity. In contrast, incubation of juice with [3H]adenosine did not cause its significant deamination to [3H]nucleosides (Fig. 6A), indicating negligible activity of adenosine deaminase (also see above). Pancreatic adenylate kinase and NDPK activities were also determined by incubating juice samples with [3H]AMP or [3H]ADP as corresponding phosphate-accepting substrates in the presence of unlabeled γ-phosphate-donating ATP/NTP (Fig. 6B). In support of qualitative autoradiographic data shown in Fig. 3, these enzyme assays confirmed moderate ATP-dependent [3H]AMP conversion into high energy [3H]phosphoryls through the adenylate kinase reaction. Unlike [3H]AMP phosphorylation, subsequent NDP kinase-mediated [3H]ADP conversion into [3H]ATP is characterized by a higher rate and can be activated not only by ATP but also by other NTPs (Fig. 6B). For comparative analysis, the major pancreatic activities shown in Fig. 6 were also expressed as nmol/ml of juice/hour and further correlated with soluble activities determined for two plasma samples. Mean activities for the following enzymes, ATPase, 5′-nucleotidase, adenosine deaminase, and adenylate kinase, were 2.1 and 0.29, 1.42 and 2.22, 0.07 and 0.20, 0.45 and 0.86 nmol/ml/hour for rat pancreatic juice and plasma, respectively. The present study shows that pancreatic juice contains both ATP-consuming and ATP-generating enzymes. The following groups of enzymes were identified: NTPDase with broad substrate specificity, 5′-nucleotidase, NDPK, and adenylate kinase. No significant activities of NPP, nonspecific phosphatases, or adenosine deaminase were detected. The fact that these purinergic enzymes are secreted into pancreatic juice is a new observation, which indicates that the release of these enzymes may be regulated. Mammalian NTPDases are a family of enzymes that catalyze hydrolysis of γ and β residues of nucleotides with different specificities. To date, there are eight members of this family. The catalytic site is facing the extracellular milieu as in NTDPases 1–3 and 8 and/or intracellular organelles as in NTDPases 4–7, and further, NTPDases 5 and 6 can be proteolytically cleaved from the plasma membrane and secreted (1Zimmermann H.

The NTPDases 1, 2, 3, and 8 catalyze hydrolysis of triphospho- and diphosphonucleotides with ATP:ADP rates of hydrolysis of about 1:1, 1:0.03, 3:1, and 2:1. The enzyme that we find in pancreatic juice can clearly hydrolyze ATP and ADP efficiently (Figs. 2, 5, and 6); ADPase activity is slightly higher and similar to the endothelial enzyme (3Yegutkin G.G.

Here, we analyzed the activation status of Rab27 using the thin layer chromatography method analyzing nucleotides bound to immunoprecipitated Rab27 and the pull-down method quantifying Rab27 bound to the GTP-Rab27-binding domain (synaptotagmin-like protein (Slp)-homology domain) of its specific effector, Slac2-b. We found that Rab27 was predominantly present in the GTP-bound form in unstimulated platelets due to constitutive GDP/GTP exchange activity. The GTP-bound Rab27 level drastically decreased due to enhanced GTP hydrolysis activity upon granule secretion. In permeabilized platelets, increase of Ca2+ concentration induced dense granule secretion with concomitant decrease of GTP-Rab27, whereas in non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue GppNHp (β-γ-imidoguanosine 5′-triphosphate)-loaded permeabilized platelets, the GTP (GppNHp)-Rab27 level did not decrease upon the Ca2+-induced secretion. These data suggested that GTP hydrolysis of Rab27 was not necessary for inducing the secretion. Taken together, Rab27 is maintained in the active status in unstimulated platelets, which could function to keep dense granules in a preparative status for secretion.

In eukaryotic cells, transport between distinct organelles is performed through vesicle trafficking. The final step of vesicle docking/fusion with target membrane is mediated by trans-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) 3The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; GDI, GDP dissociation inhibitor; Slp, synaptotagmin-like protein; SHD, synaptotagmin-like protein homology domain; Slac2, synaptotagmin-like protein homologue lacking C2 domains; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; GppNHp, β-γ-imidoguanosine 5′-triphosphate. 3The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; GDI, GDP dissociation inhibitor; Slp, synaptotagmin-like protein; SHD, synaptotagmin-like protein homology domain; Slac2, synaptotagmin-like protein homologue lacking C2 domains; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; GppNHp, β-γ-imidoguanosine 5′-triphosphate. complex bridging a vesicle and its target membrane (1Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). One of the key regulators for the SNARE complex formation is Rab GTPase (2Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2681) Google Scholar, 3Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar). So far, more than 60 members of Rab GTPases are identified in mammals, and they play critical roles in the specific transport pathways (2Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2681) Google Scholar, 3Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar, 4Jordens I. Marsman M. Kuijl C. Neefjes J. Traffic. 2005; 6: 1070-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Like other GTPases, the activity of Rab is regulated by its GDP/GTP cycle. Rab proteins have GTP-bound active and GDP-bound inactive forms. The activation process is performed by GDP/GTP exchange mediated by the GDP/GTP exchange factor. GTP-bound Rabs execute their function by interaction with effector proteins. Then, GTP-Rab is inactivated into GDP-Rab by GTP hydrolysis that is mediated by the intrinsic GTPase activity and its enhancer, GTPase-activating protein. Furthermore, the Rab family has a unique regulatory protein named Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor (RabGDI), which extracts GDP-Rab from membrane into cytosol by forming a 1:1 complex and inhibits GDP/GTP exchange (3Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar). RabGDI accompanies Rabs in cytosol to the correct organelles, where they are reactivated by the function of GDI dissociation factor (5Ullrich O. Horiuchi H. Bucci C. Zerial M.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).Although elucidation of the regulatory mechanism of the GDP/GTP cycle is crucial for understanding the functional mechanism of Rab GTPases, it has not been extensively investigated so far. Small GTPases belonging to Ras and Rho families are predominantly present in the GDP-bound forms under resting conditions and are transiently activated into GTP-bound forms upon stimulation (9Satoh T. Endo M. Nakafuku M. Akiyama T. Yamamoto T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7926-7929Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), indicating that these GTPases function as “switches” that transduce extracellular signals. For Rab GTPases, most of Rab5, a regulator of endocytic pathway (10Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar, 11Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar), is in the GDP-bound form in unstimulated NR6 cells, and more than half of Rab5 rapidly and transiently becomes the GTP-bound active form upon epidermal growth factor stimulation (12Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Gumusboga A. Highfield H. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Wells A. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ∼80% of Rab3D is in the GTP-bound form in unstimulated pancreatic acini (13Chen X. Ernst S.A. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50053-50060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Since these two results are quite opposite, it is unclear whether RabGTPases are present in its GTP-bound or GDP-bound form. Furthermore, it is not known whether the activation status of other Rab GTPases is altered upon stimulation, like Rab5.Rab27 is composed of two isoforms, Rab27A and Rab27B, that share ∼70% identical amino acid residues (14Nagata K.

Secreted ADP and serotonin play important roles for positive feedback activation of platelets at the site of thrombus formation (26Brass L.F. Hoffman R. Benz Jr., E.J. Shattil S.J. Furie B.

We have demonstrated that Rab27 regulates the secretion in platelets by showing that the addition of non-prenylated Rab27A or Rab27B purified from Escherichia coli specifically inhibited the secretion in an assay using permeabilized platelets, possibly due to sequestering its putative effector molecules (28Shirakawa R.

We have identified a Rab27 effector in platelet cytosol as Munc13-4 (28Shirakawa R. Higashi T. Tabuchi A. Yoshioka A. Nishioka H. Fukuda M. Kita T. Horiuchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10730-10737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Munc13-4 is a non-neuronal homologue of Munc13-1, an essential priming factor in neuronal secretion.In addition to Munc13-4, eight Rab27 effector molecules have been identified. Although a GTP-Rab27-binding minimal domain of Munc13-4 has not been determined, these eight molecules contain a common GTP-Rab27-binding structure named synaptotagmin-like protein (Slp)-homology domains (SHD) ∼100 amino acid long at their N-terminal ends (16Fukuda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 137: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). These eight molecules are classified into two groups: Slp1∼5 containing two C2 calcium-binding domains and Slp-lacking C2 domains (Slac2)-a∼c (16Fukuda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 137: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Although some SHDs potentially bind other Rab proteins in addition to Rab27, SHD of Slac2-b is specific for GTP-Rab27 among 20 tested Rab GTPases (16Fukuda M. J. Biochem.

By these two methods, we demonstrated that Rab27 in unstimulated platelets was predominantly in the GTP-bound form, a state that was maintained by constitutive GDP/GTP exchange activity. The GTP-bound form of Rab27 drastically decreased upon granule secretion, due to enhanced GTP hydrolysis activity that was secretion-dependent. Furthermore, we showed that GTP hydrolysis of Rab27 might not be required for the induction of secretion in platelets, namely hydrolysis would be a consequence of secretion.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Rabbit polyclonal anti-Rab27A (28Shirakawa R.

SHD of Slac2-b (KIAA0624) (amino acids 1–79) was generated by PCR using KIAA0624 clone provided by Kazusa DNA Research Institute as a template.

These His6-tagged and GST fusion proteins were produced in E. coli strain BL21 and purified according to the manufacturers' instructions. All the purified recombinant proteins were extensively dialyzed against Buffer A (50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.2, 78 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and stored at –80 °C until use.

For the assay using intact platelets, they were stimulated with 0.5 units/ml thrombin (Sigma) at 30 °C for the indicated periods, and secreted [3H]serotonin was measured by a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman) after removing platelets by centrifugation. The secretion levels of [3H]serotonin were expressed as percentages of the total [3H]serotonin in the platelets before the final incubation.The method of dense granule secretion assay using platelets permeabilized by streptolysin-O was described previously (28Shirakawa R.

Briefly, plasma membrane of [3H]serotonin-loaded platelets was permeabilized with streptolysin-O in Buffer A, where the calculated free Ca2+ concentration was ∼20 nm (36Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J.

The permeabilized platelets were incubated with ATP, human platelet cytosol at 2.0 mg of proteins/ml, and tested materials at 4 °C for 15–30 min followed by further incubation at 30 °C for 3 min. Finally, the platelets were stimulated with 20 μm Ca2+ (36Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol.

First, a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue, GTPγS, and GDP-bound His6-Rab27A and His6-Rab27B were prepared by incubation of these GTPases (0.2 μm) with 1 mm GTPγS and GDP in the presence of 4 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm EDTA at 30 °C for 30 min followed by the addition of 15 mm MgCl2 to quit the reaction as described (7Horiuchi H.

Then, GDP- and GTPγS-preloaded Rab27 (1 μg) was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) coated with GST-SHD of Slac2-b at 4 °C for 1 h in Buffer A and washed three times with the same buffer. Bead-associated His6-Rab27 was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-His6 antibody.GTP-Rab27 Pull-down Assay with GST-SHD of Slac2-b—The amount of GTP-bound Rab27 in platelets was measured by affinity pull-down using the SHD. The standard assay was as follows. Platelets isolated from freshly obtained whole blood were lysed in Buffer A containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture (P8340, Sigma) at 4 °C for 5 min followed by centrifugation at 300,000 × g for 5 min. This procedure completely extracted Rab27. Then, the supernatants were incubated with glutathione beads coated with 10 μg of GST-SHD at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads were washed three times with Buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and the protease inhibitor mixture, and bead-associated Rab27 was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Rab27 antibody. Densitometric analysis of appropriately exposed film was performed, and the signals were quantified using Image J 1.33u software (National Institutes of Health).To calculate the ratio of GDP/GTP, the standards were produced as described previously (13Chen X. Ernst S.A. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50053-50060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The same amount of aliquots of the Triton X-100 extract was incubated at 30 °C for 90 min in the presence of 10 mm EDTA and 4 mm MgCl2 with 1 mm GppNHp (a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue) or GDP followed by the addition of 15 mm MgCl2 to quit the reaction and determination of GTP-bound Rab27 by the pull-down method. The amount of pulled down Rab27 in the platelet lysate after incubation with GppNHp was defined as 100%, and that with GDP was defined as 0%.Evaluation of Nucleotide Bound to Rab27—Washed platelets (2 × 108 platelets/assay) were incubated with 300 μCi of [32P]phosphorus (200 μCi/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) in Buffer B (138 mm NaCl, 2.9 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.49 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 3 h. After the platelets were washed with Buffer B twice followed by incubation at 30 °C for 3 min, they were stimulated with 0.5 units/ml thrombin at 30 °C for 3 min. Then, platelets were lysed with Buffer A containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and the protease inhibitor mixture at 4 °C for 5 min. Supernatants after centrifugation were immunoprecipitated using anti-Rab27 antibodies at 4 °C for 30 min. Bound nucleotides were eluted in 25 μl of Buffer A containing 0.2% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm GTP, and 1 mm GDP at 85 °C for 3 min. The samples (6 μl of each) were then spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate (Merck) and developed for 90 min in 1 m LiCl2 and 1 m formic acid. The plates were dried and placed at –80 °C for 36–48 h for autoradiography. Densitometric analysis of appropriately exposed film was performed, and the signals were quantified using Image J 1.33u software (National Institutes of Health).Statistical Analysis—All values presented are means ± S.E. Student's t test was used in Fig. 7A. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTSCharacterization of the SHD of Slac2-b as the GTP-Rab27-interacting Domain—We first characterized the SHD of a Rab27-specific effector, Slac2-b. We examined whether GST-SHD specifically bound GTP-bound Rab27A and Rab27B, both of which are expressed in platelets (37Barral D.C. Ramalho J.S. Anders R. Hume A.N. Knapton H.J. Tolmachova T. Collinson L.M. Goulding D. Authi K.S. Seabra M.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We incubated GTPγS (a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue)-loaded and GDP-loaded His6-Rab27 with GST-SHD-coated glutathione beads, and bead-associated Rab27 was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-His6 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, GST-SHD efficiently bound GTPγS-loaded Rab27A and Rab27B, with minimal binding to GDP-Rab27A and -Rab27B (Fig. 1A), indicating that the SHD specifically interacted with both GTP-Rab27A and GTP-Rab27B.FIGURE 1Specific binding of SHD with GTP-Rab27 and its inhibitory effect on dense granule secretion in permeabilized platelets. A, purified His6-Rab27A (upper panel) and -Rab27B (lower panel) preloaded with GTPγS (lanes 1 and 3) or GDP (lanes 2 and 4) were incubated with glutathione beads coated with GST (lanes 1 and 2) and GST-SHD (lanes 3 and 4) at 4°C for 1 h. After washing the beads, the bead-associated His6-Rab27A and -Rab27B were detected by immunoblotting with anti-His6 antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data shown are representative of three independent experiments with similar results. B, permeabilized platelets were first incubated with various concentrations of GST (open circles) and GST-SHD (closed circles) at 4 °C for 30 min, and the Ca2+-induced dense granule secretion ([3H]serotonin) was analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The secretion without the Ca2+ stimulation was shown (×). The results shown are expressed as means ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we analyzed the involvement of Rab27 in the secretion using the SHD, which would sequester GTP-bound Rab27. In the assay, more than 50% of [3H]serotonin preloaded into dense granules in permeabilized platelets was secreted within 1 min in response to Ca2+ stimulus at 30 °C, whereas the background secretion was 5–10% (Fig. 1B). The addition of GST-SHD, but not GST, in the assay efficiently inhibited the secretion in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1B), supporting our previous observation that Rab27 regulates dense granule secretion in platelets (28Shirakawa R.

Yoshioka A. Horiuchi H. Nishioka H. Tabuchi A. Kita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33844-33849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To solubilize Rab27 from the membrane fraction in platelets, we used 0.5% Triton X-100, under which condition the interaction of the SHD with GTP-Rab27 was not affected. As shown in Fig. 2A, platelets (∼5 × 107) isolated from 1 ml of blood contained ∼50 ng of Rab27, determined using purified recombinant His6-Rab27A as a reference. When the same amount (50 ng) of the recombinant His6-Rab27A protein was used for a pull-down assay, almost all of the GTP-loaded form was bound to beads coated with 10 or 20 μg of GST-SHD but not to GST beads (Fig. 2A). Thus, this GST-SHD pull-down assay was established, and we used this method to evaluate the GTP-Rab27 levels in platelets.FIGURE 2A GTP-Rab27 pull-down assay using SHD revealed that GTP-Rab27 was predominant in unstimulated platelets. A, GTP-loaded-His6-Rab27A purified from E. coli (50 ng) (lane 1) was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with glutathione beads coated with GST (lane 2), 10 μg of GST-SHD (lane 3), and 20 μg of GST-SHD (lane 4) followed by washing, and the bead-associated His6-Rab27A was detected by immunoblotting with anti-Rab27 antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Platelet lysate isolated from 1 ml of blood was also analyzed (lane 5). The data shown are representative of three independent experiments with similar results. B, GTP-Rab27 in platelet lysate isolated from 1 ml of whole blood (lane 2) was incubated with glutathione beads coated with 10 μg of GST-SHD at 4 °C for 30 min, and bead-associated Rab27 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-Rab27 antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As controls, the same amounts of platelet lysates loaded in vitro with GDP (lane 1) or GppNHp (lane 3) were also analyzed in the same method. The data shown are representative of five independent experiments with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Evaluation of GTP-Rab27 Level in Platelets—Using this pull-down assay, we evaluated the ratio of GTP-bound form of Rab27 in platelets. The results were calibrated as described previously (13Chen X. Ernst S.A. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50053-50060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), where the GDP/GTP-bound status of Rab3D in pancreatic acini was evaluated by their pull-down assay using a Rab3-effector RIM-1 (13Chen X. Ernst S.A. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50053-50060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). They solubilized pancreatic acinar cells, and the cell lysates were loaded with GTPγS or GDP. The amount of GST-RIM-1-associated Rab3D loaded with GTPγS was defined as 100%, and that loaded with GDP was defined as 0% (13Chen X. Ernst S.A. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50053-50060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here, we analyzed the GDP/GTP status of Rab27 in platelets and found that more than 70% (74.3 ± 3.0%, means ± S.E. of five individuals) of Rab27 was the GTP-bound form in unstimulated platelets (Fig. 2B).We also evaluated the GDP/GTP-bound status of Rab27 by the thin layer chromatography method. Isolated platelets were first incubated at 37 °C for 3 h with [32P]phosphorus that would be incorporated into GTP and GDP in platelets. As shown below (see Fig. 4B), nucleotide bound to immunoprecipitated Rab27 was predominantly GTP (62.7 ± 4.7%, means ± S.E. of three individuals). Thus, we obtained consistent results both by the pull-down and by the thin layer chromatography methods. We concluded that Rab27 was predominantly in the GTP-bound form in unstimulated platelets.FIGURE 4GTP-Rab27 decreased upon granule secretion through enhanced GTP hydrolysis activity. A, isolated platelets were stimulated with 0.5 units/ml thrombin for the indicated periods at 30 °C. Then, GTP-Rab27 (upper panel) was measured by the GTP-Rab27 pull-down assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The total Rab27 in the samples was shown in the lower panel. Relative changes of GTP-Rab27 were presented using the GTP-Rab27 ratio at time 0 as a standard (1.0). The data shown are expressed as means ± S.E. of three independent experiments.

It is strongly up-regulated after acute injury to the adult brain, and application of exogenous activin protects neurons in several lesion models. To explore the role of endogenous activin in the normal and acutely damaged brain, we generated transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative activin receptor IB (dnActRIB) mutant in forebrain neurons. The functionality of the transgene was verified in vivo. Hippocampal neurons from dnActRIB mice were significantly more vulnerable to intracerebroventricular injection of the excitotoxin kainic acid than those from control littermates, indicating a crucial role of endogenous activin in the rescue of neurons from excitotoxic insult. Because dnActRIB is only expressed in neurons, but not in glial cells, activin affords protection at least in part through a direct action on endangered neurons. Unexpectedly, the transgenic mice also revealed a prominent novel role of activin in glutamatergic neurotransmission in the intact adult brain. Electrophysiologic examination of excitatory synapses onto CA1 pyramidal cells in hippocampal slices of dnActRIB mice showed a reduced NMDA current response, which was associated with impaired long term potentiation. This is the first demonstration that activin receptor signaling is essential to optimize the performance of neuronal circuits in the mature brain under physiological conditions.

This is the first demonstration that activin receptor signaling is essential to optimize the performance of neuronal circuits in the mature brain under physiological conditions. Activins are members of the transforming growth factor β family of proteins, which regulate proliferation and differentiation of various cell types. The predominant activin variants are homo- or heterodimers consisting of βA and/or βB subunits (activin A: βAβA, activin B: βBβB and activin AB: βAβB). Their biological effects are mediated through heteromeric receptor complexes, consisting of type I and type II transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors (1Phillips D.J. Fourth Ed. The Cytokine Handbook. 2. Academic Press, New York2003: 1153-1177Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, one of the activin type II receptors (ActRII or ActRIIB) dimerizes with a type I receptor (ActRIA, ActRIB, or activin receptor-like kinase 7 (2Mathews L.S. Vale W.W.

Endocrinol. 2004; 220: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar)), resulting in phosphorylation of the type I receptor by the type II receptor. The subsequently activated serine/threonine kinase of the type I receptor phosphorylates the recruited receptor Smads (Smad2 and Smad3). The latter translocate to the nucleus upon multimerization with Smad4 and modulate as transcription factor complexes the expression of activin target genes (4ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 64-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In addition, other signaling pathways are also activated by activin receptors, including mitogen activated kinase signaling (1Phillips D.J. Fourth Ed. The Cytokine Handbook. 2.

In the central nervous system, activin is involved in development, but it may also participate in adaptive and protective mechanisms of the adult brain. Thus, activin βA mRNA is transiently up-regulated after electrical stimuli that induce synaptic long term potentiation (LTP 4The abbreviations used are: LTP, long term potentiation; dnActRIB, dominant-negative activin receptor IB; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RPA, RNase protection assay; TBS, theta bursts stimuli; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride; RT, reverse transcription; fEPSP, field excitatory postsynaptic potential; FJB, Fluoro-Jade B; KA, kainate; tg, transgenic; wt (or WT), wild-type; EPSC, excitatory postsynaptic current; CNQX, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; NR, NMDA receptor; CaMKII, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein. ; Refs. 6Andreasson K.

Duman R.S. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4908-4916Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A much stronger and prolonged induction of activin A expression occurs after acute brain injury (9Tretter Y.P. Munz B. Hübner G. ten Bruggencate G. Werner S. Alzheimer C. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 1819-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Tretter Y.P. Hertel M. Munz B. ten Bruggencate G. Werner S.

Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 2691-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Since exogenous activin protects cultured neurons (12Krieglstein K. Suter-Crazzolara C. Fischer W.H. Unsicker K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 13Iwahori Y. Saito H. Torii K. Nishiyama N. Brain Res. 1997; 760: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), these findings suggested that activin might also afford neuroprotection in vivo. Indeed, intracerebroventricular application of activin A rescued neurons after excitotoxic and hypoxic/ischemic insults (10Tretter Y.P. Hertel M. Munz B. ten Bruggencate G. Werner S. Alzheimer C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 14Hughes P.E. Alexi T. Williams C.E. Clark R.G. Gluckman P.D.

Brain Res. 1999; 835: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the site of action and the function of endogenous activin in the intact and the injured brain remain to be determined. Therefore, we generated transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative mutant of activin receptor IB (dnActRIB) in forebrain neurons. For this purpose, the complete kinase domain of the receptor was deleted. When expressed in excess in comparison to the endogenous receptor, dnActRIB preferentially forms non-functional heterodimers with type II receptors upon ligand binding, thereby blocking activin receptor signaling (16Zhou Y. Sun H. Danila D.C. Johnson S.R Sigai D.P. Zhang X. Klibanski A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 2066-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Using this strategy, we report here the novel and unexpected finding that activin signaling augments plasticity of excitatory synapses in the adult brain, while, at the same time, reducing its vulnerability to excitotoxic damage. Generation of Transgenic Mice—The transgene construct (Fig. 1A) was separated from vector sequences (Fig. 1A), and the purified insert was used for microinjection of fertilized oocytes from B6D2F2 × C57BL/6 mice. Mice were genotyped by PCR, and transgenic animals were backcrossed into the C57BL/6 strain. Intracerebroventricular Injection of KA, Activin A, or PBS— Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and placed into a stereotaxic apparatus. Intracerebroventricular injection of 0.1 μlofKA(1 μg/μl in PBS, pH 7.0) was performed as described by Tretter et al. (9Tretter Y.P. Munz B. Hübner G. ten Bruggencate G. Werner S. Alzheimer C. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 1819-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Tretter Y.P. Hertel M. Munz B. ten Bruggencate G. Werner S. Alzheimer C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) with permission from the veterinary authorities, Zurich, Switzerland. To verify the functionality of the transgene, 150 ng of activin A in 0.8 μl of PBS or solvent PBS were injected intracerebroventricularly. Ipsilateral hippocampi were removed 2 h later and used for preparation of protein lysates and subsequent Western blotting. RNase Protection Assay (RPA)—RNA was isolated from hippocampi, and RPAs were performed (9Tretter Y.P. Munz B. Hübner G. ten Bruggencate G. Werner S. Alzheimer C. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 1819-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) using a 507-bp probe corresponding to the 5′-end of the murine ActRIB cDNA and some region of the hybrid intron present in the expression vector (Fig. 1A) and a fragment corresponding to nucleotides 566-685 of the murine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization with a digoxygenin-labeled riboprobe was performed on frozen sections from whole brains as described by Yang et al. (17Yang H. Wanner I.B. Roper D. Chaudhari N. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) using a riboprobe corresponding to sequences of the polyadenylation signal of the vector (Fig. 1A). Western Blotting—Hippocampi were lysed in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 0.5 mm AEBSF, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 μm phenylarsinoxide, phosphatase inhibitor mixture I/II (Sigma, Munich, Germany; 1:100). Lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using polyclonal antibodies against the c-Myc epitope, total Smad2 and Smad3 (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or phospho-Smad2 (pSmad2; kindly provided by Dr. C.-H. Heldin, Uppsala, Sweden). In addition, a monoclonal antibody against β-actin (Sigma) was used. Immunostaining—Frozen sections (25 μm) from normal and injured hippocampus were fixed with ice-cold methanol, and endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by a 20 min treatment with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol. Sections were then treated for 30 min with PBS, 3% BSA, 0.02% Nonidet P-40 to block unspecific binding sites and subsequently incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175, Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA). After incubation with the secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG, peroxidase-coupled (Promega, Wallisellen, Switzerland), they were stained with diaminobenzidine in 0.01% H2O2. For immunofluorescence analysis, frozen sections were fixed with ice-cold methanol and unspecific binding sites were blocked as described above. Sections were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against phospho-Smad2 (see above), and phospho-Smad2-positive cells were detected with Cy3-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, Westgrove, PA). Real-time RT-PCR—RNA from total hippocampi was reverse transcribed and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using SYBR Green technology as described by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). RNA samples, which had not been reversely transcribed were used as a negative control. The following primers were used: NMDA receptor 1 (NR1), 5′-GCC CAA CGC CAT ACA GAT G-3′ and 5′-GGC GGG TGA CTA ACT AGG ATA GC-3′; NR2A, 5′-TGC TAC GGG CAG ACA GAG AAG-3′ and 5′-GCC ATC CCA AGT CAC ATT GAC-3′; NR2B, 5′-GAC CTG CAT GCG GAA TAC AGT-3′ and 5′-TAG CCT GGT TCC TCA TCT GTT TTA-3′; β-actin, 5′-CGT GAA AAG ATG ACC CAG ATC A-3′ and 5′-CAC AGC CTG GAT GGC TAC GT-3′. Quantification of Neuronal Survival—Frozen coronal brain sections (25 μm) were stained with cresyl violet (Nissl staining) or Fluoro-Jade B (FJB) (Histo-Chem. Inc, Jefferson, AR; 0.0004% in 0.1% acetic acid) as described by Schmued and Hopkins (18Schmued L.C. Hopkins K.J. Brain Res. 2000; 874: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). FJB-stained sections were analyzed using ImageJ software (W. S. Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MA). After background subtraction, inversion, and calibration of the picture, a binary was made, and the area of all black pixels was measured. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test for non-Gaussian distribution. Preparation of Hippocampal Slices and Electrophysiology— Transverse hippocampal slices (350 μm) were prepared from the brain of control and mutant mice (2-4 months of age). Slices were constantly superfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid composed of (in mm) 130 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, and 10 d-glucose, gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2, pH 7.4. Field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) recordings from stratum radiatum of area CA1 were performed and analyzed by means of a multielectrode system (MED64 in conjunction with Performer 2.0 software, Panasonic, Japan). In the recording chamber, submerged slices were constantly superfused with warmed artificial cerebrospinal fluid (30 °C). Before and after tetanization, test and control pathways were stimulated at 0.05 Hz. The stimulus strength was adjusted to obtain ∼40% of the maximum fEPSP amplitude under control conditions. LTP was induced by two theta bursts stimuli (TBS) 20 s apart, with each TBS consisting of 15 bursts of 4 pulses at 100 Hz delivered at an interburst interval of 200 ms. fEPSPs slopes were normalized to 100% before TBS and pooled across animals of the same genotype. Data were processed and analyzed using Origin Pro7 software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA) and were given as mean ± S.E. Pipettes for whole-cell recordings of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were filled with (in mm) 130 potassium gluconate, 3 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 5 HEPES, 2 Na2-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, pH 7.25-7.30. Series resistance (10-20 MΩ) was compensated by 70-85%. EPSCs were recorded in the presence of the GABAA (γ-aminobutyric acid, type A) receptor antagonist bicuculline (30 μm) at -70 mV, after correcting for liquid junction potentials. Whole-cell recordings were performed at room temperature. Current signals were recorded and analyzed using an Axopatch 200 amplifier in conjunction with a Digidata 1200 interface and pClamp 9 software (all from Axon Instruments). Data were expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were performed using Student's t test. All drugs were from Sigma. Generation of Transgenic Mice Expressing dnActRIB in Hippocampal Neurons—To inhibit activin receptor signaling in hippocampal neurons in vivo, we generated transgenic mice expressing dnActRIB with a carboxyterminal c-Myc epitope under the control of the CaMKII-α promoter and regulatory elements (19Mansuy I.M. Winder D.G. Moallem T.M. Osman M. Mayford M. Hawkins R.D. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1998; 21: 257-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The progeny of seven transgenic founder mice expressed the transgene as determined by RPA using a riboprobe, which can distinguish between transgene-derived and endogenous ActRIB mRNA (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Lines 1 and 3 with the highest expression level were used for further studies. The transgene-derived protein was detected by Western blotting using an antibody against the c-Myc epitope (Fig. 1C). In situ hybridization with a transgene-specific probe revealed the presence of dnActRIB transcripts in neurons of the cortex, amygdala, and striatum (data not shown). As expected from the promoter activity (20Mayford M. Bach M.E. Huang Y.Y. Wang L. Hawkins R.D. Kandel E.R. Science. 1996; 274: 1678-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar), the strongest signal was observed in the hippocampal pyramidal and dentate granule cell layers (Fig. 1D). No specific signals were detected with the same probe on sections from control mice (Fig. 1F) or with the sense probe on sections of mice from both genotypes (Fig. 1E and data not shown). To verify the dominant-negative effect of the transgene in vivo, activin A or vehicle PBS were injected intracerebroventricularly, and the phosphorylation of Smad2 in the ipsilateral hippocampus was monitored by Western blotting 2 h after injection. A basal level of Smad2 phosphorylation was already observed in non-injected or vehicle-injected hippocampi (Fig. 2A), and this signal was predominantly attributed to hippocampal neurons as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2C). When compared with PBS, activin A reproducibly increased the levels of pSmad2 in the ipsilateral hippocampus of wild-type mice (Fig. 2A), whereas no increase in the levels of pSmad2 were observed in the ipsilateral hippocampus of transgenic mice upon injection of activin A (Fig. 2A). Levels of total Smad2 were not affected by activin A in wild-type and transgenic mice (Fig. 2A). This result was reproduced in three independent experiments with hippocampal lysates from different animals, and the difference between transgenic and wild-type mice was statistically significant (p = 0.012; Fig. 2B). Therefore, the transgene is obviously functional in vivo. Enhanced Vulnerability to KA Excitotoxicity in dnActRIB Mutant Mice—Histological analysis of the brain of the transgenic animals did not reveal any detectable abnormalities in the non-lesioned hippocampus, and neuronal death was not observed as determined by FJB staining, a marker for degenerating neurons (18Schmued L.C. Hopkins K.J. Brain Res. 2000; 874: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar) (data not shown). To elucidate the neuroprotective potential of endogenous activin, we performed intracerebroventricular kainate (KA) injections, which cause neuronal loss predominantly in the ipsilateral CA3 region (Fig. 3, A-D, Nissl staining, and E-H, staining with FJB). This injury is accompanied by strong up-regulation of activin βA expression in wild-type and dnActRIB transgenic mice (Ref. 9Tretter Y.P. Munz B. Hübner G. ten Bruggencate G. Werner S. Alzheimer C. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 1819-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar and data not shown). Apoptotic cells were detected by staining with an antibody against cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 3I). Staining with this antibody correlated with the pattern of FJB staining in the same area (Fig. 3K), although cleaved caspase-3 positive cells comprise only a part of the population of the FJB positive cells. The area of FJB-positive hippocampal cells was measured ipsilaterally and contralaterally in a rectangular area of 1381.5 × 1094.6 μm (Fig. 3, E-H), and every third section through the posterior-anterior extent of the hippocampi was analyzed. Therefore, the data represent an unbiased sampling of FJB-positive cells within the hippocampus. The number of FJB-positive cells in the ipsilateral hippocampi was significantly higher in transgenic (tg) mice of both lines compared with wild-type (wt) littermates (L1-tg, n = 93 sections from 10 mice; L1-wt, n = 100 sections from 10 mice; Pips = 0.0015 (Fig. 3L); L3-tg, n = 60 sections from 6 mice; L3-wt, n = 60 sections from 6 mice, Pips < 0.0001) (Fig. 3M). Furthermore, the extent of cell death in the contralateral hippocampus, the so-called “distant damage” produced by hyperactivity of the commissural fibers connecting the hippocampi was elevated, although the difference was only statistically significant in one mouse line (L3-tg, n = 60 sections from 6 mice; L3-wt, n = 60 sections from 6 mice; Pcon = 0.0004 (Fig. 3M); L1-tg, n = 80 sections from 8 mice; L1-wt, n = 90 sections from 9 mice; Pcon = 0.3697) (Fig. 3L). Since intracerebroventricular KA up-regulates activin βA mRNA also in the contralateral hippocampus (9Tretter Y.P. Munz B. Hübner G. ten Bruggencate G. Werner S. Alzheimer C. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 1819-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the results suggest that disruption of activin signaling renders hippocampal neurons more vulnerable to both local and distant excitotoxic injury. The NMDA Receptor-mediated Component of Glutamatergic Neurotransmission Is Reduced in Hippocampi from dnActRIB Mutant Mice—Are neurons from dnActRIB mutant hippocampi more vulnerable to excitotoxic damage, because they respond more sensitively to glutamate? To explore this possibility, we recorded EPSCs from visually identified CA1 pyramidal cells in hippocampal slices. To partially relieve the Mg2+ block of NMDA receptors, extracellular Mg2+ was lowered to 0.3 mm (4.0 mm Ca2+). d-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (50 μm) and CNQX (10 μm) served to isolate the AMPA and the NMDA receptormediated component of the EPSC, respectively. Whereas the input-output relationship of the overall EPSC was not appreciably altered in mutant hippocampi, the NMDA component was significantly reduced (Fig. 4, A and B; wt, n = 9 slices from 3 mice; L1-dn, n = 9 from 3 mice; L3-dn, n = 8 from 2 mice). The histogram of Fig. 4C shows that the relative contribution of the NMDA current to the overall EPSC (12.9 ± 1.3% in pyramidal cells of normal hippocampi) decreased to 8.1 ± 1.3% and 8.1 ± 0.6% in pyramidal cells of L1 and L3 mutant hippocampi, respectively. By contrast, the time course of NMDA currents did not vary between the different groups (decay time constants: wt, 22.8 ± 2.9 ms, n = 9; L1-dn, 22.3 ± 3.3 ms, n = 9; L3-dn, 23.3 ± 5.3 ms, n = 8, p > 0.9). These data suggest that dnActRIB is unlikely to influence considerably NMDA receptor 2 (NR2) subunit expression, since changes in NR2 subunit composition would be expected to alter the kinetics of NMDA currents (21Monyer H. Burnashev N. Laurie D.J. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 2004; 12: 529-540Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2881) Google Scholar). A comparison of the expression of NR1, NR2A, and NR2B subunits by means of quantitative real-time RT-PCR lends further support to this notion. Using hippocampal total RNA from wild-type and transgenic mice, we failed to detect a significant change in the expression levels of any of the above subunits (Fig. 5). Furthermore, protein levels of NR2A were not altered as demonstrated by Western blotting of total hippocampal lysates from adult wild-type and transgenic mice (data not shown).FIGURE 5Expression of NMDA receptor subtypes in the hippocampus. Total RNA was isolated from hippocampi of adult tg and wt littermates and analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR for the mRNA levels of the NMDA receptor subtypes NR1, NR2A, and NR2B. Analysis of β-actin mRNA levels was used as an internal standard. Bars represent mean ± S.D. from three RT-PCR reactions. The expression level of NR1 was arbitrarily set as 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The reduction of the NMDA component was also observed in experiments in which we used bath application of either AMPA (1 μm) or NMDA (10 μm) to mimic the massive rise in extracellular glutamate that is a hallmark of acute excitotoxicity (Fig. 4D). Under these conditions, extrasynaptic glutamate receptors are also activated. In cells of both mutant lines, AMPA responses at more negative potentials were smaller than those in cells from normal hippocampus, but only in L1-dn neurons, this decrease reached statistical significance (Fig. 4E: WT, n = 9 slices from 3 mice; L1-dn, n = 7 slices from 2 mice; L3-dn, n = 8 slices from 3 mice). Since the AMPA receptor-mediated component of the EPSC was not reduced in a similar fashion, it is tempting to speculate that the decreased current responses to AMPA superfusion resulted mainly from an altered expression and/or function of extrasynaptic AMPA receptors. NMDA currents displayed the characteristic increase with membrane depolarization, which was, however, drastically diminished in mutant hippocampi of both lines (Fig. 4F: wt, n = 7 slices from 2 mice; L1-dn, n = 7 slices from 2 mice; L3-dn, n = 8 slices from 3 mice). Synaptic Plasticity Is Impaired in Hippocampi from dnAc-tRIB Mutant Mice—Since NMDA receptor activation is essential for the induction of LTP in the CA1 region, we wondered whether the decrease of NMDA responses bears significance on the extent of synaptic plasticity in hippocampi of mutant mice. Using a MED64 multielectrode stimulation and recording system, two independent afferent pathways were electrically stimulated to evoke fEPSPs in stratum radiatum of area CA1 (Fig. 6A). During control stimulation, fEPSP slopes did not differ significantly between hippocampi from wild-type and transgenic mice (L1-wt: 111 ± 9 μV/ms, n = 8 versus L1-dn: 86 ± 10 μV/ms, n = 10, p > 0.10; L3-wt: 86 ± 6 μV/ms, n = 18 versus L3-dn 95 ± 5 μV/ms, n = 15, p > 0.23). Also, paired-pulse stimulation (50-ms interstimulus interval) yielded virtually identical ratios of facilitation (L1-wt: 1.51 ± 0.03, n = 16 versus L1-dn: 1.47 ± 0.03, n = 20), p > 0.5; L3-wt: 1.33 ± 0.03, n = 14 versus L3-dn: 1.34 ± 0.05 n = 22, p > 0.5). Following theta burst stimulation, hippocampi from both mutant lines showed significantly impaired LTP compared with controls (Fig. 6B: L1-wt, n = 8 slices from 3 mice; L1-dn, n = 10 slices from 4 mice; Fig. 6C: L3-wt, n = 18 slices from 6 mice; L3-dn, n = 15 slices from 4 mice). Whereas in L1-wt hippocampi, the mean fEPSP slope at 25-30 min post-TBS attained 165 ± 9% of control, L1-dn hippocampi displayed an increase of fEPSP slope to only 135 ± 8% of control (p = 0.033). In recordings from L3 hippocampi, in which extracellular Mg2+ was lowered to 1 mm, the corresponding values were 179 ± 7% for the wt-hippocampi and 155 ± 5% for the dn-hippocampi (p = 0.012). These data indicate that the decrease of the NMDA component observed in whole-cell recordings from mutant hippocampi is sufficient to compromise synaptic plasticity. To gain insight into the role of endogenous activin in the normal and injured hippocampus, activin receptor signaling was disrupted in hippocampal neurons. ActRIB was mutated, since it specifically binds to ActRII-activin ligand-receptor complexes (22Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Montalvo E. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and since it is expressed in hippocampal neurons (23Soderstrom S. Bengtsson H. Ebendal T. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 286: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). 5M. R. Müller and S. Werner, unpublished data. Therefore, it can inhibit, in a dominant-negative manner, activin signaling via all activin type I receptors (16Zhou Y. Sun H. Danila D.C. Johnson S.R Sigai D.P. Zhang X. Klibanski A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 2066-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Since expression of the transgene was hardly detectable in cultured hippocampal neurons (data not shown), we confirmed the activity of this mutant and its specificity for activin versus transforming growth factor β in cultured keratinocytes (24Bamberger C. Schärer A. Antsiferova M. Tychsen B. Pankow S. Müller M. Rülicke T. Paus R. Werner S. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 167: 733-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Most importantly, the dominant-negative effect of the transgene was verified in vivo after intracerebroventricular injection of activin A. In these experiments, activin increased the levels of phosphorylated Smad2 in the hippocampus of wild-type mice but not of transgenic mice. The CaMKII-α promoter was chosen, because it drives expression of transgenes in forebrain neurons but not in glial cells. Since appreciable activity of this promoter is not observed before the second postnatal week, the transgene is unlikely to interfere with prenatal and early postnatal development (20Mayford M. Bach M.E. Huang Y.Y. Wang L. Hawkins R.D. Kandel E.R. Science. 1996; 274: 1678-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Although our study focuses on the role of activin signaling in the hippocampus, it is worth noting that, by using the CaMKII-α promoter, the transgene is also expressed in other forebrain regions such as cortex, amygdala, and striatum. Consistent with this notion, in situ hybridization indeed revealed the presence of dnActRIB transcripts in these regions. Thus it is well conceivable that the disruption of activin signaling will also bear significance on the normal operation of other brain circuits. Further experiments should help to determine whether activin regulates glutamatergic neurotransmission and excitotoxicity in other forebrain structures in a fashion similar to that reported here from the hippocampus. Our study demonstrates that activation of activin receptor signaling by endogenous ligands is capable of rescuing hippocampal neurons from excitotoxic cell death. The responsible ligand is most likely activin A, since the βB chain is not expressed in the normal or lesioned hippocampus (9Tretter Y.P. Munz B. Hübner G. ten Bruggencate G. Werner S. Alzheimer C. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 1819-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A contribution of bone morphogenetic protein 3 (BMP3) to the observed phenotype cannot be fully excluded, since it also binds to activin receptors (25Gamer L.W. Nove J. Levin M. Rosen V. Dev. Biol. 2005; 285: 156-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and since we found a weak expression of BMP3 in normal and injured hippocampus, using real-time RT-PCR (data not shown). However, a contribution of BMP3 to the enhanced vulnerability of the hippocampus of our transgenic mice seems unlikely, since BMP3 is an inhibitor of activin receptor signaling (25Gamer L.W. Nove J. Levin M. Rosen V. Dev. Biol. 2005; 285: 156-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and since activin was shown to be neuroprotective (see above). Enhanced vulnerability to KA toxicity was observed in both transgenic mouse lines, demonstrating that the effect is not due to integration of the transgene into a host gene, which is important for neuroprotection. Unexpectedly, we found a stronger vulnerability in the transgenic line, which expressed lower levels of dnActRIB. Although the transgene was expressed in forebrain neurons in both mouse lines as determined by in situ hybridization, minor differences in the temporal and spatial expression of the transgene, which are often observed with the CamKII-α promoter (20Mayford M. Bach M.E. Huang Y.Y. Wang L. Hawkins R.D. Kandel E.R. Science. 1996; 274: 1678-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar), may account for the difference in vulnerability. Given the selective disruption of activin receptor signaling in neurons, but not in glial cells, neuroprotection by activin receptor ligands is obviously afforded at least in part through a direct action on endangered neurons. Since fibroblast growth factor 2, whose neuroprotective potential is closely linked to the induction of activin A (10Tretter Y.P. Hertel M. Munz B. ten Bruggencate G. Werner S. Alzheimer C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), exerts its beneficial action in part by down-regulating NMDA receptors (26Alzheimer C. Werner S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2002; 513: 335-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we wondered whether the enhanced vulnerability of dnActRIB mutant mice might be attributable to abnormal NMDA responses. To our surprise, however, we found that under physiological conditions (synaptic stimulation) as well as under pathological conditions (glutamate overflow), the NMDA current was significantly depressed in pyramidal cells of mutant hippocampi, whereas the AMPA current was not or less affected. Thus we discard the hypothesis that the heightened vulnerability of mutant mice to excitotoxic injury results from an overactivity of glutamate receptors. Whereas the neuroprotective mechanisms of activin have thus to await further study, our findings reveal a prominent new function of activin in the normal adult brain that bears particular relevance to synaptic plasticity. The NMDA receptor deficiency that we observed in mature CA1 pyramidal cells of mutant hippocampi should not represent a developmental disturbance, because the transgene is expressed under the control of the CaMKII-α promoter. We rather propose that activin receptor signaling in adult hippocampus is required to augment NMDA responses, thereby endowing the synapse with its full range of plasticity. Thus genetic or acquired defects of the activin system are likely to impact on synaptic performance in the learning brain as well as on neuronal survival during injury. In the future, it will be important to identify the intracellular signaling pathways, which mediate the effect of activin on forebrain neurons. Since activin was shown to signal via Smad2 in the hippocampus (this study), an involvement of this pathway seems likely. In addition, a role of mitogen-activated kinase signaling should be considered, since activation of ERK1/2 by activin was found to be responsible for the activin-induced expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in mouse E14 primary striatal cell cultures and in a hippocampal neuronal cell line (27Bao Y.L. Tsuchida K. Liu B. Kurisaki A. Matsuzaki T. Sugino H. J. Endocrinol. 2005; 194: 493-504Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Our results reveal novel functions of activin at glutamatergic synapses. Thus, in addition to its endocrine functions and its role in inflammation and repair (1Phillips D.J. Fourth Ed. The Cytokine Handbook. 2. Academic Press, New York2003: 1153-1177Google Scholar, 5Werner S. Alzheimer C. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2006; 17: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), activin seems to be an important modulator of neuronal activity. This finding is likely to be of clinical interest, since application of exogenous activin or stimulation of activin receptors should not only provide protection of endangered neurons but might also emerge as a novel therapeutic approach to improve cognitive impairments.

The attachment of bacteria expressing Dr adhesins to DAF induces clustering of DAF around bacterial cells and also recruitment of CEA-related cell adhesion molecules. CEA, CEACAM1, and CEACAM6 have been shown to serve as receptors for some Dr adhesins (AfaE-I, AfaE-III, DraE, and DaaE). We demonstrate that AfaE-I, AfaE-V, DraE, and DaaE adhesins bind to the N-domain of CEA. To identify the residues involved in the N-CEA/DraE interaction, we performed SPR binding analyses of naturally occurring variants and a number of randomly generated mutants in DraE and N-CEA. Additionally, we used chemical shift mapping by NMR to determine the surface of DraE involved in N-CEA binding. These results show a distinct CEA binding site located primarily in the A, B, E, and D strands of the Dr adhesin. Interestingly, this site is located opposite to the beta-sheet encompassing the previously determined binding site for DAF, which implies that the adhesin can bind simultaneously to both receptors on the epithelial cell surface. The recognition of CEACAMs from a highly diverse DrCEA subfamily of Dr adhesins indicates that interaction with these receptors plays an important role in niche adaptation of E. coli strains expressing Dr adhesins."

We characterize the molecular determinants of SPP cleavage and show that SPP processing is also required for productive viral infection in nonhuman primates. These observations reveal that host SPP has been coopted by a surrogate for HCV for functions that are essential to its life cycle, thus suggesting novel therapeutic approaches for treatment of HCV infection. The novel role played by SPP in this host-pathogen interaction, which has not been reported previously for other intramembrane-cleaving proteases, offers unique possibilities for unraveling the mechanisms and processes engaged in intramembrane proteolysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Plasmids—pSFV1-GBV-B/WT was created by extending the coding region expressed by pSFV/GB1-398 (24Hope R.G. Murphy D.J. McLauchlan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4261-4270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). pSFV/GB1-398 expresses the GBV-B core and E1 proteins and contains an epitope tag following amino acid residue 85 to enable detection of core protein (24Hope R.G. Murphy D.J. McLauchlan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4261-4270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Extended sequences encoding E2, p13, and the N terminus of NS2 were generated by PCR amplification of pGBB (kindly provided by J. Bukh), which contains the entire cDNA of the GBV-B genome (12Bukh J. Apgar C.L. Yanagi M. Virology. 1999; 262: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, pSFV1-GBV-B/WT contained nucleotides 426-2762 of the GBV-B genome with an insert of 42 nucleotides following position 700, which encoded the epitope tag. Specific mutations in the core-E1 signal sequence were engineered into this plasmid to generate the mutants described in Table 1. To produce plasmids encoding GBV-B reference polypeptides, nucleotide sequences encoding the N-terminal 144, 146, 148, 150 and 152 amino acids of core were amplified from pSFV1-GBV-B/WT by PCR and inserted into pSP64 poly(A) (Promega). For tamarin inoculations, mutations in the core-E1 signal sequence contained in pSFV1-GBV-B/Mut4, -7, and -9 were inserted into pGBV-B/2, an infectious molecular clone of GBV-B (16Martin A. Bodola F.

Virol. 2000; 81: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Where necessary, cells were incubated with 100 μm (Z-LL)2 ketone immediately following electroporation until the cells were harvested 12-14 h after electroporation (27Weihofen A. Lemberg M.K.

Bound antibody was visualized with appropriate secondary antibodies, and cells were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope.

RNA (1 μg) was used to program separate translation reactions using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Western Blot Analysis—Proteins from cell extracts and in vitro translation reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-pp65 antibody as described previously (24Hope R.G.

After incubation with secondary antibody, proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence.Infectivity Assay in Tamarins—Plasmids encoding the full-length GBV-B nucleotide sequence containing specific mutations in the core-E1 signal peptide region were linearized by digestion with XhoI prior to T7 RNA polymerase-mediated transcription in vitro using the T7 MegaScript system (Ambion). The integrity and abundance of the RNA were evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis. To assess the infectivity of transcribed RNA in tamarins (Saguinus mystax), ∼100 μg of RNA was inoculated directly into the liver, and at 7-14-day intervals post-inoculation, serum was collected and assayed for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity and viral RNA levels. In the latter case, RNA was isolated using a QiaAmp viral RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) and quantitated by real-time, 5′-exonuclease, reverse transcription-PCR (TaqMan) using a one-step procedure with the TaqMan EZ core reagent kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and primers located within the GBV-B NS5A sequence as described previously (16Martin A. Bodola F. Sangar D.V. Goettge K. Popov V. Rijnbrand R. Lanford R.E. Lemon S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9962-9967Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Animals were housed at the Southwest National Primate Center at the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research (San Antonio, TX) and cared for in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research.RESULTSGBV-B Core Protein Is Processed by SPP—The signal sequences located at the C terminus of GBV-B and HCV core are substrates for cleavage by signal peptidase between amino acid residues 156/157 and 191/192, respectively (28Ghibaudo D. Cohen L. Penin F. Martin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24965-24975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 29Hijikata M. Kato N. Ootsuyama Y. Nakagawa M. Shimotohno K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). HCV core is processed further by SPP within the h-region of the signal sequence to generate a mature product, which is considered to participate in virion morphogenesis (30Yasui K. Wakita T. Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Funahashi S.I. Ichikawa M. Kajita T. Moradpour D. Wands J.R. Kohara M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6048-6055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SPP cuts also in an analogous position in classical swine fever virus (CSFV), a pestivirus that is related to HCV (31Heimann M. Sosa G.R. Martoglio B. Thiel H.J. Rumenapf T. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1915-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To determine whether GBV-B core is a substrate for SPP, a polyprotein encompassing GBV-B core to the N-terminal region of NS2 and including an epitope tag inserted within the core sequence (Fig. 1A) was expressed in BHK cells in the absence or presence of (Z-LL)2 ketone, a SPP inhibitor (27Weihofen A. Lemberg M.K. Ploegh H.L. Bogyo M. Martoglio B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30951-30956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the absence of (Z-LL)2 ketone, a core species of about 18.5 kDa was observed, which increased in molecular weight upon treatment of cells with the compound (Fig. 2A). We deduced that core protein detected in the presence of (Z-LL)2 ketone represented the signal peptidase-cleaved product terminating at Gly156, which had been trimmed in untreated cells by SPP to give a smaller species. To identify the approximate position of SPP cleavage, the electrophoretic mobility of mature GBV-B core was compared with that of a panel of GBV-B reference peptides that had been translated in vitro and differed in length by 2 amino acids (Fig. 2B). GBV-B core co-migrated with peptides extending to Val144 and Cys146 (Fig. 1B), placing the SPP cleavage site within the h-region of the GBV-B core-E1 signal sequence, which is consistent with the reported sites in the corresponding HCV and CSFV signal sequences (Fig. 1B).FIGURE 2GBV-B core protein is cleaved by SPP. A, BHK cells either mock-electroporated or electroporated with RNA prepared from pSFV1-GBV-B/WT were incubated in the absence or presence of 100 μm (Z-LL)2 ketone. Signal peptidase- and SPP-cleaved species are indicated by filled and open circles, respectively. B, GBV-B core reference peptides, ending at the indicated amino acid residues, were synthesized in vitro and ran alongside a BHK cell extract expressing the GBV-B core-ΔNS2 polyprotein from pSFV1-GBV-B/WT. In A and B, extracts were examined for the presence of GBV-B core by Western blot analysis. C and D, the intracellular localization of GBV-B core was examined in the absence (C, panels i-vi; D, panels i and iii) or presence (D, panels ii and iv) of (Z-LL)2 ketone. Cells were stained for core (C, panels i and iv; D, panels i and ii) and either counterstained with oil red O (C, panel ii) or calnexin (C, panel v), and merged panels are shown on the right (C, panels iii and iv). Lipid droplets in cells examined by phase contrast (D, panels iii and iv) are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)GBV-B core localizes to the surface of lipid droplets within the cytoplasm of cells, and only small amounts of protein are detected at the ER membrane (24Hope R.G. Murphy D.J. McLauchlan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4261-4270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). To determine whether SPP cleavage is needed for lipid droplet association, the distribution of GBV-B core was examined in cells treated with (Z-LL)2 ketone. Under these conditions, no lipid droplet localization was observed and the protein adopted a reticular cytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 2D, compare panels i and ii). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that, analogous to its HCV counterpart, GBV-B core is cleaved by SPP and this process is required for lipid droplet localization.Efficient SPP Cleavage Requires Ser149 in the h-region of the GBV-B C-E1 Signal Sequence—Having established that GBV-B core was a substrate for SPP, and that the cleavage status of core could be reliably assayed by Western blot analysis and lipid droplet association, the next goal was to identify residues within the core-E1 signal sequence required for SPP proteolysis. From previous in vitro studies, it has been determined that small, helix-destabilizing amino acids within the h-region of signal sequences are critical for SPP cleavage (4Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 10McLauchlan J. Lemberg M.K. Hope G. Martoglio B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3980-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Therefore, we targeted Cys146, Ser149, Ala151, and Cys152 within the h-region of the core-E1 signal sequence (Fig. 1B) for mutagenesis to either leucine or valine, because these residues have a high pro-pensity to form α-helices in a hydrophobic environment (Table 1 and Ref. 32Li S.C. Deber C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The cleavage profile of mutated core proteins was examined in BHK and Huh-7 cells by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3A). Treatment of BHK cells with (Z-LL)2 ketone was included to control for any variations in protein mobility that might result from modifying the amino acid composition of the core-E1 signal sequence (10McLauchlan J. Lemberg M.K. Hope G. Martoglio B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3980-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 33Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 319: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Because (Z-LL)2 ketone is less effective at inhibiting SPP activity in Huh-7 cells, 3P. Targett-Adams, T. Schaller, G. Hope, R. E. Lanford, S. M. Lemon, A. Martin, and J. McLauchlan, unpublished observations. the compound was not used to treat this cell type. However, as an additional indicator of SPP cleavage, the ability of the mutated core proteins to localize to lipid droplets was assessed in both cell types (Table 1). Typically, lipid droplet association was more restricted for mutants expressed in BHK as compared with Huh-7 cells (for example, compare the values for pSFV1-GBV-B/Mut1 in both cell types). This discrepancy results from the greater number of lipid droplets in Huh-7 cells (34Targett-Adams P. Chambers D. Gledhill S. Hope R.G. Coy J.F. Girod A. McLauchlan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15998-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, for mutants with reduced or no lipid droplet association in BHK cells, the amount of protein attached to droplets in Huh-7 cells also was lowered, and there was a corresponding increase in diffuse intracellular staining.FIGURE 3Amino acid sequence requirements for SPP cleavage of GBV-B core in cultured cells. A, RNA from the indicated pSFV1-GBV-B plasmids were used to electroporate BHK or Huh-7 cells. In parallel, BHK cells were treated with (Z-LL)2 ketone as a control, and the cleavage status of the core proteins in both cell types was examined by Western blot analysis. Signal peptidase- and SPP-cleaved species are indicated by filled and open circles, respectively. B and C, the intracellular localization of GBV-B core proteins was examined in BHK cells electroporated with RNA transcripts from the indicated pSFV1-GBV-B plasmids. Cells were counterstained with oil red O (B) or calnexin (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mutation of three amino acids in the h-region (Cys146, Ser149, and Ala151 in pSFV1-GBV-B/Mut1) gave a core species that co-migrated with the protein generated in the presence of (Z-LL)2 ketone (Fig. 3A, BHK) and abolished lipid droplet association in BHK cells (Table 1). In Huh-7 cells, there was some evidence of attachment of core to lipid droplets in 31% of cells, but most of the protein was distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Table 1). Therefore, only a minor proportion of core expressed by pSFV1-GBV-B/Mut1 retains susceptibility to cleavage by SPP. By contrast, mutation at Cys152 gave levels of SPP-cleaved core and lipid droplet association that could not be distinguished from those for the wild-type protein (pSFV1-GBV-B/Mut2) (Fig. 3A, BHK, and Table 1). By progressively introducing additional mutations into pSFV1-GBV-B/Mut2, it was found that Cys146 also did not contribute to SPP proteolysis (pSFV1-GBV-B/Mut3) (Fig. 3A, BHK, and Table 1), whereas there was some contribution from Ala151 (pSFV1-GBV-B/Mut4; Table 1), because a small amount of the signal peptidase processed species was detected (Fig. 3A, BHK). An identical profile for processed species was observed in Huh-7 cells (Fig. 3A, Huh-7). Introduction of a further mutation at Ser149 in pSFV1-GBV-B/Mut4 abolished both SPP proteolysis and lipid droplet association (pSFV1-GBV-B/Mut5) (Fig. 3A and Table 1), suggesting that this amino acid was critical for processing. To determine the impact of mutation only at Ser149, we generated pSFV1-GBV-B/Mut6 in which serine was replaced with leucine, but no other mutations were present in the core-E1 signal sequence. For this mutant, neither SPP-cleaved protein nor attachment to lipid droplets could be detected in BHK cells (Fig. 3A, BHK, and Table 1). In Huh-7 cells, only a small amount of protein processed by SPP was found (Fig. 3A, Huh-7), and its association with lipid droplets was reduced to levels detected for pSFV1-GBV-B/Mut1 (Table 1). Therefore, we concluded that Ser149 is crucial for efficient SPP cleavage in the GBV-B core-E1 signal sequence.Characteristics of Serine That Promote SPP Cleavage—To test whether SPP cleavage is specified by the small size of the side chain on serine or its propensity to destabilize α-helices, we replaced it with glycine (pSFV1-GBV-B/Mut7), alanine (pSFV1-GBV-B/Mut8), methionine (pSFV1-GBV-B/Mut9), and tyrosine (pSFV1-GBV-B/Mut10). Both alanine and glycine have small side chains, in common with serine, whereas tyrosine and methionine are bulkier residues. In terms of α-helix propensity in an apolar environment, alanine, tyrosine, and methionine are well tolerated, but glycine destabilizes α-helices, because it increases conformational freedom (32Li S.C. Deber C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). All of the mutants were generated from pSFV1-GBV-B/Mut4. The replacement of Ser149 with either tyrosine or methionine abolished lipid droplet localization (Fig. 3B, panels vii-ix, data not shown, and Table 1) and production of SPP-cleaved core in both BHK and Huh-7 cells (Fig. 3A). Staining of cells with calnexin indicated that the core protein processed solely by signal peptidase was located on the ER membrane (Fig. 3C, panels x-xii, and data not shown). By contrast, glycine and alanine generated core that was located either on lipid droplets (Fig. 3, B and C, panels iv-vi) or the ER membrane (Fig. 3C, panels vii-ix; data not shown). Introduction of these amino acids led to mature core protein that was cleaved by SPP although to a lesser extent as compared with serine in either BHK or Huh-7 cells (Fig. 3A). Based on these results, particularly on the different characteristics shown by comparing alanine, tyrosine, and methionine, we deduce that the small size of the side chain on serine makes a greater contribution to SPP cleavage than its ability to destabilize α-helices. Moreover, serine gave the highest amount of SPP-processed product, and thus its polar group is likely to contribute also to cleavage efficiency.Maturation of Core by SPP Is Essential for Productive GBV-B Infection in Vivo—To determine whether SPP cleavage is required for genome infectivity in vivo, the mutated core-E1 signal sequences present in pSFV1-GBV-B/Mut4, Mut7, and Mut9 (Table 1) were introduced into pGBV-B/2 (16Martin A. Bodola F. Sangar D.V. Goettge K. Popov V. Rijnbrand R. Lanford R.E. Lemon S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The epitope tag present in GBV-B core in the pSFV constructs was not included in the GBV-B clones to prevent any detrimental effects on introducing additional sequences into the polyprotein. This strategy gave three clones that were predicted to allow 1) efficient SPP cleavage (pGBV-B/Mut4), 2) processing by signal peptidase but not SPP (pGBV-B/Mut9), or 3) comparable amounts of signal peptidase- and SPP-cleaved core (pGBV-B/Mut"

To better understand the allosteric interactions that regulate actin function, we created a muscle/yeast hybrid actin containing a muscle-specific outer domain (subdomains 1 and 2) and a yeast inner domain (subdomains 3 and 4). Actin with muscle subdomain 1 and the two yeast N-terminal negative charges supported viability. The four negative charge muscle N terminus in a muscle subdomain 1 background caused death, but in the same background actin with three N-terminal acidic residues (3Ac/Sub1) led to sick but viable cells. Addition of three muscle subdomain 2 residues (3Ac/Sub12) produced no further deleterious effects. These hybrid actins caused depolarized cytoskeletons, abnormal vacuoles, and mitochondrial and endocytosis defects. 3Ac/Sub1 G-actin exchanged bound ϵATP more slowly than wild type actin, and the exchange rate for 3Ac/Sub12 was even slower, similar to that for muscle actin. The mutant actins polymerized faster and produced less stable and shorter filaments than yeast actin, the opposite of that expected for muscle actin. Unlike wild type actin, in the absence of unbound ATP, polymerization led to ADP-F-actin, which rapidly depolymerized. Like yeast actin, the hybrid actins activated muscle myosin S1 ATPase activity only about one-eighth as well as muscle actin, despite having essentially a muscle actin-specific myosin-binding site. Finally, the hybrid actins behaved abnormally in a yeast Arp2/3-dependent polymerization assay. Our results demonstrate a unique sensitivity of yeast to actin N-terminal negative charge density.

Alternatively, they may affect overall filament conformation and dynamics resulting in loss of proper function in the yeast cell. Studies involving specific muscle-like mutations in yeast actin are limited. One region of interest has been the N terminus. Substitution of the N-terminal two acidic residues of yeast actin with four acidic residues from the muscle actin N terminus (4Ac mutant) leads to a phenotypically normal yeast; this modified actin activates skeletal myosin S1 ATPase activity 3-fold better than WT 4The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; OG, Oregon Green maleimide; DTT, dithiothreitol; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. 4The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; OG, Oregon Green maleimide; DTT, dithiothreitol; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. yeast actin (10Cook R.K. Root D. Miller C. Reisler E. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2410-2415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lu et al. (11Lu X. Bryant M.K. Bryan K.E. Rubenstein P.A. Kawai M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 564: 65-82Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) demonstrated, using a reconstituted cardiac muscle fiber system, that 4Ac yeast actin generated about 80% of the tension seen with muscle actin; WT yeast actin produced tension just greater than base line, and 3Ac actin (three N-terminal acidic residues) produced about 40% of the tension seen with muscle actin. Another study demonstrated that yeast actin possesses a 9-fold difference in affinity for ATP versus GTP in contrast to the 1,000-2,000 difference for muscle actin. It further showed that this difference is due in large part to a Phe-306 (yeast) to Tyr (muscle) substitution in the nucleotide-binding pocket (12Wen K.K. Yao X. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41101-41109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).In this study, we have addressed three major questions. First, what determinants are important for the unique properties of muscle actin? Second, what is the role of interaction between the large and small domains of actin in controlling actin filament topology and dynamics? Third, what is the molecular basis for the incompatibility between muscle actin and yeast viability considering the high degree of homology between yeast and muscle actins? We reasoned that a yeast/muscle hybrid actin containing one normal yeast and one normal muscle domain would provide insight into answers for these questions. For these studies, we have made a yeast/muscle hybrid actin consisting of subdomains 3 and 4 from yeast actin (large domain) and subdomains 1 and 2 from muscle actin (small domain). We inserted the muscle substitutions into the small domain because this domain interacts with many different actin-binding proteins and is likely to reflect species-specific differences in its ability to interact with various actin-binding proteins. We have then assessed the effects of the hybrid actin in vivo in yeast and on various parameters of actin function in vitro using purified proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSMutagenesis and Construction of Mutant StrainsMutant actin plasmids were constructed with the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and used to transform yeast essentially as described previously (13McKane M. Wen K.K. Boldogh I.R. Ramcharan S. Pon L.A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36494-36501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Plasmid shuffling then led to cells producing only the mutant actin. Mutagenic primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). For the 3Ac/sub1 and 3Ac/sub12 actins, the WT plasmid had to be force-selected against 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), toxic to URA3-containing cells, during the plasmid shuffling. Mutant plasmids rescued from the trp+, ura- cells were sequenced to verify the presence of the mutations.Determination of Mutant PhenotypesCell growth in liquid culture at 30 °C was monitored by measuring the cell density (A600) with time, and doubling times were determined as described previously (13McKane M. Wen K.K. Boldogh I.R. Ramcharan S. Pon L.A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36494-36501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Mutant strains were tested for temperature sensitivity, hyperosmotic sensitivity, and the ability to grow with glycerol as a sole carbon source (13McKane M. Wen K.K. Boldogh I.R. Ramcharan S. Pon L.A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36494-36501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Cell StainingMitochondria Visualization—Mitochondrial morphology was monitored in cells previously transformed with a centromeric plasmid containing the mitochondrial targeting sequence of citrate synthase 1 fused to green fluorescent protein (CS1-GFP) driven by the endogenous citrate synthase promoter as described previously (13McKane M. Wen K.K. Boldogh I.R. Ramcharan S. Pon L.A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36494-36501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14Okamoto K. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 277-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Actin Cytoskeleton Observation—Formaldehyde-fixed cells described above were treated with 0.5 mg/ml saponin (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 30 min and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline to remove residual detergent. Cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline to which was added rhodamine phalloidin at a final concentration of 1.1 μm. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Fluorescence images of actin filaments were captured as described below. To establish the normal pattern for the actin cytoskeleton, we only counted budding cells in which the size of the bud was less than 1/3 the size of the mother cells when there is maximum asymmetry of patch distribution and the greatest degree of polarization of actin cables.Vacuole Staining—Vacuoles were stained with MDY-64 from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's protocol with modifications. Overnight cultures were subcultured with agitation at 30 °C from an A600 of about 0.1 in YPD to an A600 of between 0.3 and 0.4. Cells were resuspended in staining buffer (10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, and 5% glucose) followed by the addition of 10 μm MDY-64, and the suspensions were incubated at room temperature for 3 min. Cells were resuspended in fresh staining buffer, and vacuole morphology was monitored by fluorescence microscopy as described below. The cells were categorized as containing four or fewer equally sized lobes (normal), greater than four approximately normal to abnormally small sized lobes (hypervesiculated), or abnormally large vacuole lobes (greater than half the size of the cell) but fewer than four lobes.Endocytosis Assay—Lucifer yellow internalization was monitored as described previously (15Pringle J.R. Preston R.A. Adams A.E. Stearns T. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Jones E.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 31: 357-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, 2 ml of cells in early log phase (A600 =∼0.3) were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in fresh YPD. Lucifer yellow was added to a final concentration of 13 mg/ml, and the cells were incubated at 30 °C with agitation for 1 h. Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold succinate/azide buffer (50 mm sodium succinate, pH 5, containing 20 μm NaN3) and resuspended in a small volume of the same buffer. Labeled vacuoles were observed by fluorescence microcopy.Fluorescence MicroscopyFluorescence images were collected with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) using a Plan-Apochromat ×100, 1.4 NA objective lens, and a cooled CCD camera (Spot RT monochrome, Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Microscope control and image recording/enhancement were performed using Metamorph (Universal Imaging Corp.). Image color manipulation, image overlapping, and cell counting were performed with a combination of ImageJ software package (National Institutes of Health) and Adobe Photoshop version 7.0. For the analysis of actin filament and mitochondrial morphology, 20 z-sections were obtained at 0.2-μm intervals through the entire cell. Out-of-focus light was removed by two-dimensional deconvolution using the Metamorph package, and each series of images was stacked to a two-dimensional image by ImageJ.Protein PreparationsYeast WT and muscle hybrid actins in the Ca2+ globular (G) form were purified as described (16Cook R.K. Blake W.T. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9430-9436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actin concentrations were determined by the UV absorbance at 290 nm using the extinction coefficient ϵ = 25.6 mm-1·cm-1. G-actin was stored in G-buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mm DTT) at 4 °C and used within 5 days following completion of purification. DTT-free F-actin in DTT-free F-buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 2mm MgCl2, and 50 mm KCl) was labeled at Cys-374 with Oregon Green maleimide (OG; Molecular Probes) at a molar ratio of 1:5 (actin:OG) at room temperature for at least 2 h. The OG-labeled F-actin was collected by centrifugation and depolymerized by dialysis against G-buffer. The extent of labeling was determined by the ratio of the probe concentration determined by UV absorbance at 491 nm (using the extinction coefficient of ϵ = 8100 m-1·cm-1 for OG) versus the actin concentration determined as described above. The labeling efficiency for each actin was between 65 and 75%. The OG-labeled actins were stored at 4 °C and used within 5 days. Protein A-tagged yeast Arp2/3, N-WASP, and Listeria monocytogenes ActA were prepared as described (17Lauer P. Chow M.Y. Loessner M.J. Portnoy D.A. Calendar R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4177-4186Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Proteins were aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Each aliquot of yArp2/3 was used within 2 days after thawing. Bovine cardiac tropomyosin was purified as described (18Butters C.A. Willadsen K.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15565-15570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Characterization of Actin in VitroActin polymerization was monitored by the increase in light scattering or the increase in fluorescence of Cys-374-pyrenelabeled actin following addition of 2 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm KCl to induce polymerization. Nucleotide exchange was determined by following the displacement of bound etheno-ATP by ATP as a function of time. Thermostability was determined by the change in molar ellipticity of the protein as a function of temperature. These assays and measurement of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence were performed as described previously (12Wen K.K. Yao X. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41101-41109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For conversion of Ca2+-G-actin to Mg2+-G-actin, 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.5, and 0.2 mm MgCl2 were added simultaneously to the G-actin solution at 4 °C for 1 h, and the Mg-actin was used within 2 h.Electron Microscopy and Actin Filament Length Measurement—F-actin, 2.5 μm, was diluted 3-fold with F-buffer and applied to carbon-coated Formvar grids. Following negative staining with 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate, samples were examined using a JEOL JEM-1230 transmission electron microscope. Filaments images were recorded with a Gatan UltraScan 1000 2 × 2k CCD camera (University of Iowa Electron Microscope Facility). We measured the contour lengths of at least 100 filaments of each actin sample, which clearly showed both filament ends, using ImageJ software.Actin Bead Recruiting Assay—Polystyrene beads, 4.89 μm diameter (Bangs Laboratory, Inc., Fishers, IN), were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in ActA-containing absorption solution (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 μm ActA) at a final volume ratio of 0.1%. The reaction was stopped by the addition of bovine serum albumin (Sigma) to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml for another 10 min on ice. Beads were stored in storage buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 4 °C for 2 days.For the actin recruiting assay, the reaction contained 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.2 mm ATP, 10 mm DTT, 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 200 μm diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 7 μm OG-labeled actin (5% labeled), 0.1 μm yeast Arp2/3, and ActA-absorbed beads at a final concentration of 0.004%. The fluorescent halo formed around the beads, because of actin polymerization triggered by Arp2/3 and ActA, was observed by fluorescence microscopy as described above.RESULTSOrientation of the Mutations Used—To make a more muscle-like actin in yeast, we focused our attention on subdomains 1 and 2 (Fig. 1A). These subdomains are on the outside of the filament and serve as the binding surface for a number of actin-binding proteins, and we reasoned they were most likely to exhibit altered interactions with yeast-specific actin-binding proteins. We grouped the variant residues into regional cassettes that we could use to subdivide our study. The names of these cassettes are shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1 and are based on the muscle amino acids introduced. Some differences such as the His-372 in yeast versus the corresponding Arg in muscle actin reflect a difference between yeast and higher eukaryotic actins in general. One significant region, named CLV, reflects a basic difference between muscle actins and nonmuscle actins, including yeast actin as does Thr-103. A third notable difference is the acidic N terminus. Yeast has two acidic residues; β-or γ-nonmuscle actin has three, and muscle actin has four. This set of residues on a totally unstructured finger-like projection from the body of G-actin appears to be a major site of interaction with muscle myosin.TABLE 1Nomenclature and the mutant origin for each cassette of residues used in this reportCassetteOrigin3AcN (terminus), DED4AcN (terminus), DEDETTV5T/A6TCLVI10C, M16L/C17VTLAV103T, M110L/S114AMASTARF132M/S135A, T350S/S358T, T350S/S358T, S365A, H372RVKI (Sub2)I43V, R68K, V76I Open table in a new tab Interestingly, the subdomain 1 mutations appear to largely occupy a column encased in a shell of nonvariant secondary structural elements (Fig. 1). The column runs diagonally through the interior of subdomain 1 connecting the nucleotide-binding site in the inter-domain cleft with the surface of the protein surrounding the C and N termini. This arrangement suggests that this collection of residues may provide a way of transducing information from protein-protein interactions occurring at or near the termini with the nucleotide cleft and hinge regions that control actin dynamics.Most Subdomain 1 Muscle Substitutions Support Yeast Viability—Beginning with the C terminus, we carried out successive rounds of mutagenesis on the WT yeast actin gene. After we accumulated several muscle-like mutations, we examined the mutant strains for any biologically significant defects. The strains MASTAR, CLV/MASTAR, and TT/CLV/MASTAR (see Table 1) displayed normal growth patterns with respect to growth arrest and doubling time. They also showed no differences from wild-type cells when plated at various temperatures or on media supplemented with either 0.9 m NaCl (resistance to hyperosmolar conditions) or glycerol (functional mitochondria). However, addition of Thr-103, Leu-110, and Ala-114 led to a mutant strain TT/CLV/TLA/MASTAR that has an early growth arrest at about 85% of the level achieved by wild-type cells and a 1.4-fold longer doubling time. It also shows a slight sensitivity to 37 °C. All of these mutant cells were obtained by plasmid shuffling in ura+, trp- medium without having to resort to selection on 5-FOA in agreement with our other results demonstrating a lack of significant defects associated with the altered proteins.Addition of a Four Acidic N-terminal Sequence to Modified Yeast Actin—To completely create an entire muscle-like subdomain 1, we attempted to convert the yeast N-terminal DSEV amino acid sequence to DEDE (4Ac) in our longest mutant, TT/CLV/TLA/MASTAR. Although cells containing the 4Ac/TT/CLV/TLA/MASTAR plasmid were viable with WT actin expressed in the same cell, we could not obtain cells in which this mutant was the only actin in the cell using standard plasmid shuffling alone or with 5-FOA to bias the selection toward slower growing cells. This synthetic lethality was particularly surprising considering the 4Ac cassette by itself produced no significant phenotype in vivo (10Cook R.K. Root D. Miller C. Reisler E. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2410-2415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Addition of a Three Acidic N-terminal Sequence to Modified Yeast Actin—The question remained as to whether yeast would better tolerate the other subdomain 1 mutations if the acidic residues at the N terminus were reduced from 4 to the 3 residues as is found in mammalian nonmuscle actins. Amazingly, substitution of 3Ac for 4Ac on the previously lethal 4Ac/TT/CLV/TLA/MASTAR (3Ac/Sub1 actin) produced a viable yeast strain. However, 5-FOA selection was needed for its isolation, indicating defects in actin function. At 30 °C, the mutant cells grew with twice the doubling time of WT cells, and its growth in YPD arrested at a level 40% lower than that obtained by WT cells (Fig. 2). This mutant actin caused lethality at 37 °C, and the cells displayed a marked cold sensitivity at 24 °C. Growth on glycerol and on hypertonic medium was normal.FIGURE 2Growth curves of strains carrying 3Ac/sub1 and 3Ac/sub12 mutant actins. WT and mutant strains were grown as indicated under “Materials and Methods.” The A600 was monitored over time as described under “Materials and Methods.” The insertion table shows the log phase doubling time (D.T.) of the strains carrying either WT or mutant actins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Addition of Subdomain 2 Mutations—We next added the three subdomain 2 mutations (VKI cassette in Table 1) to 3Ac/Sub1 actin. For simplicity, we call this new mutant 3Ac/Sub12. Selection on 5-FOA plates was again necessary to obtain this mutant. Its growth rate and extent are slightly better than 3Ac/Sub 1 (Fig. 2), but it retains the lethality observed at 37 °C and cold sensitivity at 24 °C (data not shown).Effect of Muscle Mutations on Cellular Organization—To better define the cellular basis for the 3Ac/Sub1 and 3Ac/Sub12 actin cell growth defects, we first examined the actin cytoskeleton by staining formaldehyde-fixed cells with rhodamine phalloidin following mild treatment with saponin to increase exposure of the actin to the stain. Both strains exhibited either randomly distributed actin patches or randomly distributed deposition of actin cables of varying lengths (Fig. 3 and Table 2) signifying a loss in polarity within the cells.FIGURE 3Alterations of actin cytoskeletal structure by the mutant hybrid actins. Cells in early log phase were fixed with formaldehyde, treated with saponin, and then stained with rhodamine phalloidin as described under “Materials and Methods.” Shown are multiple images (A-D) of each cell line captured by fluorescence microscopy. The data were analyzed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Quantitation results are shown in Table 2.

Open table in a new tab The abnormal cytoskeletal patterns suggested the mutations might have affected mitochondrial morphology and distribution because these parameters have been associated with a properly functioning actin cytoskeleton (19Wertman K.F. Drubin D.G. Botstein D. Genetics. 1992; 132: 337-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using green fluorescent protein-citrate synthase as a mitochondrial marker (see “Materials and Methods”), we observed no strikingly abnormal mitochondrial phenotype, although the cells seemed to exhibit a slightly more aggregated or randomly distributed mitochondrial pattern compared with normal cells (data not shown). This finding agrees with the ability of the mutant cells to grow on glycerol as a sole carbon source.We also attempted to assess vacuole morphology that is tightly linked to actin cytoskeleton function (20Hill K.L. Catlett N.L. Weisman L.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1535-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Only a very small population of the mutant cells could be stained when we attempted to visualize vacuoles with the commonly used membrane dye FM®4-64. This result implied that either vacuole integrity was damaged or, because the dye enters through endocytosis, this process is defective in these cell strains. We then used a membrane-permeable vacuole-specific dye MDY-64 instead. Fig. 4 shows that vacuoles were easily observed in all cells tested. However, vacuole appearance was much more heterogeneous than that observed in WT cells. We sorted the cells into three groups according to vacuole morphology as follows: those with normal vacuoles, those with large vacuoles, and those with larger than normal numbers of vacuolar lobes as described under “Materials and Methods.” Table 2 shows that the distribution among these categories was similar for each of the two mutant cell strains. These observations suggest the mutations that led to altered vacuoles, possibly by affecting the fission/fusion processes that regulate vacuole morphology, were common to all strains examined. Assessment of vacuole inheritance was not possible with the experimental approach we employed.FIGURE 4Change of vacuole morphology and inhibition of lucifer yellow uptake by the hybrid actins. Live cells in early log phase were either incubated with MDY-64 for 5 min at room temperature or lucifer yellow (LY) at 30 °C for 1 h.

Fig. 4 and Table 2 demonstrate that only 2% of 3Ac/Sub12 cells and none of the 3Ac/Sub1 cells contain lucifer yellow, again correlating with an endocytosis defect caused by the mutant actins.In Vitro Characterization of Hybrid Actin Behavior—The yeast/muscle hybrid actins allowed us to assess the importance of the hinge region and inter-domain allosteric interactions on both G- and F-actin function as well as the importance of interacti"
https://openalex.org/W1977335857,"We explored three approaches to create tissue-specific knock-in mice by generating knock-in mice in which a substrate-docking site of the PDK1 protein kinase was ablated in Cre-expressing tissues in a way that prevented activation of one of its substrates, p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K), but not another (protein kinase B (PKB)). Employing two of the approaches, termed the “heterozygous” and “minigene” methods, we generated mice in which Cre-expressing skeletal and cardiac muscle produced the mutant rather than wild type PDK1. Consistent with this, injection of these mice with insulin only induced activation of PKB but not S6K in muscle tissues. We have also demonstrated that insulin-stimulated glucose uptake proceeds normally in knock-in mice, consistent with the notion that PKB mediates this process. In contrast to conditional knock-out of PDK1 in muscle, the knock-in mice did not develop dilated cardiomyopathy, suggesting that PKB plays a key role in protecting mice from heart failure. The third knock-in strategy that was evaluated, termed the “inversion” method, did not proceed with high efficiency. We discuss the merits and disadvantages of each of the conditional knock-in approaches, along with the applications for which they may be most suited, and suggest how they could be further refined.

The ability to generate targeted mutation of proteins in mice by using knock-in methodologies is a powerful approach to investigating the physiological roles of disease-causing mutations and the functional roles of domains (1Mikkola H.K.

Ronaldson L. Shpiro N. Marquez R. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The knock-in approach also has significant advantages over conventional knock-out approaches that are currently more widely used to analyze the function of genes (reviewed in Ref. 5Vanhaesebroeck B. Rohn J.L. Waterfield M.D. Cell. 2004; 118: 274-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To date most knock-in mutations have been carried out in a manner that leads to the mutant gene being present in all cells; however, this can have drawbacks, for instance premature lethality or unwanted phenotypes. Embryonic lethality in conventional knock-outs can be overcome by employing Cre/LoxP recombinase methodology, in which the exons to be deleted are flanked with 34-base pair DNA recognition sites (LoxP) for the P1 bacteriophage Cre recombinase (6Nagy A. Genesis. 2000; 26: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). These mice are crossed to transgenic mice that express Cre in specific tissues or developmental stages. In tissues expressing Cre, efficient recombination between the LoxP sequences takes place, resulting in the excision of the intervening DNA sequence and ablation of gene expression (6Nagy A. Genesis. 2000; 26: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). The ability to generate conditional knock-in mice using Cre/LoxP technology would be very beneficial; however, the methodology is less well characterized. In Fig. 1 we summarize three approaches that could be employed to generate tissue-specific knock-in mice. In the first strategy termed the “heterozygous” method, a mouse is generated in which one allele comprises the wild type exon flanked with LoxP sites, whereas the second allele contains the knock-in exon and is not flanked with LoxP sites. In tissues that express Cre, the wild type exon will be excised leaving only expression of the knock-in allele (Fig. 1A). The potential disadvantages of this method are that in non-Cre-expressing tissue both the mutant and wild type protein are expressed, and in the Cre-expressing tissues the knock-in protein may be expressed at half of the normal levels. To avoid expression of mutant protein in non-Cre-expressing tissues, we used the “minigene” method. In this method, an allele is constructed in such a way that in the absence of Cre, the wild gene is expressed through its natural promoter and exons that occur prior to the knock-in mutation, whereas expression of the remaining exons occurs through a minigene DNA cassette that is flanked by LoxP sequences (Fig. 1B). The construct is designed so that Cre-mediated recombination leads to the excision of the minigene cassette, resulting in the expression of the knock-in mutant instead (Fig. 1B). A third approach, called the “inversion” method, relies upon the finding that a modification of sequence and orientation of LoxP sequences leads to inversion rather than excision of the DNA sequence flanked by the LoxP sequences upon Cre-mediated recombination (7Zhang Z. Lutz B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e90Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the inversion method, the knock-in exon is cloned in an anti-parallel orientation after the wild type exon and the wild type and inverted knock-in exons are flanked with the modified LoxP sites (Fig. 1C). In the absence of Cre, the wild type exon will be expressed and the sequence within the inverted knock-in exon should be spliced-out of the pre-mRNA. In the presence of the Cre recombinase, DNA inversion would result in the knock-in exon being expressed rather than the wild type (Fig. 1C). A similar approach has recently been used to mimic a chromosomal translocation that occurs in human cancers (8Forster A. Pannell R. Drynan L.F. Codrington R. Daser A. Metzler M. Lobato M.N. Rabbitts T.H. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study we have evaluated these approaches of generating conditional knock-in mice, using a mutation in 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) 2The abbreviations used are: PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; EDL, extensor digitorum longus; ERK, extracellular-regulated kinase; ES, embryonic stem; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; Mck, muscle creatine kinase; PIF, PDK1-interacting fragment; PKB, protein kinase B; RSK, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase; RT, reverse transcriptase; S6K, p70 ribosomal S6 kinase. as an example. PDK1 plays an important role in insulin and growth factor signaling pathways by phosphorylating and activating the key effector kinases protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt) and ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) (9Mora A. Komander D. Van Aalten D.M. Alessi D.R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Our previous biochemical and structural studies, summarized in Fig. 1D, indicate that PDK1 possesses a substrate docking site termed the “PIF pocket” that is required for PDK1 to phosphorylate S6K but not PKB (10Biondi R.M.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4219-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, in knock-in embryonic stem (ES) cell lines in which both copies of the PDK1 gene are altered to express a form of PDK1 retaining catalytic activity, but in which the PIF-pocket site is disrupted by mutation of Leu-155 to Glu, IGF1 induced normal activation of PKB but not S6K (13Collins B.J. Deak M. Arthur J.S. Armit L.J. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4202-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It is however not possible to generate global PDK1L155E/L155E knock-in mice, as the embryos of this phenotype die at embryonic day 11, displaying multiple phenotypes (14McManus E.J. Collins B.J. Ashby P.R. Prescott A.R. Murray-Tait V. Armit L.J. Arthur J.S. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2071-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated whether the conditional knock-in strategies outlined above can be used to generate mice that express the mutant PDK1[L155E] rather than wild type PDK1 in muscle tissues. Materials—Protein G-Sepharose, streptavidin-Sepharose, [α-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Protease-inhibitor mixture tablets and Taq polymerase were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Precast SDS-polyacrylamide bis-Tris gels were from Invitrogen. Human insulin from Novo-Nordisk was obtained from Ninewells Pharmacy, Dundee, United Kingdom. Antibodies—The following antibodies were raised in sheep and affinity-purified on the appropriate antigen. The PDK1 antibody was raised against the sequence RKIQEVWRQQYQSNPDAAVQ corresponding to residues 540–559 of mouse PDK1; the ERK2 antibody was raised against the full-length human protein; the PKB total antibody used for immunoblot analysis was raised against the sequence RPHFPQFSYSASGTA (residues 466–480) of rat PKB; and the phospho-PKB Ser-473 was raised against the peptide PHFPQFpSYSAS. The total GSK3α was raised against residues 471–483 of rat GSK3α (QAPDATPTLTNSS) and the total GSK3β against the full-length human protein; the total S6K1 antibody was raised against residues 25–44 of the human protein (AGVFDIDLDQPEDAGSEDEL); the phospho-S6 protein Ser-235 antibody was raised against the residues 229–242 of human S6 protein (AKRRRLpSSLRASTS); the total S6K2 used to measure the activity after immunoprecipitation was raised against residues 479–495 of the mouse S6K2 protein; and the total p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) antibody used to immunoprecipitate all RSK isoforms was raised against residues 712–734 of the human p90 RSK2 protein (RNQSPVLEPVGRSTLAQRRGIKK). The total PKBα antibody used to immunoprecipitate PKBα was a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against residues 1–149 of human PKB and was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (catalog no. 05-591). The phospho-PKB Thr-308 (catalog no. 9275), phospho-GSK3α/β Ser-9/21 (catalog no. 9336), phospho-S6K Thr-389 (catalog no. 9205), and total S6 ribosomal protein (catalog no. 2212) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. The pan-PDK1 site antibody purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (catalog no. 9379) was found to recognize the phosphorylated T-loop Thr-229 of S6K in cell extracts (15Collins B.J. Deak M. Murray-Tait V. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5023-5034Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase were from Pierce. General Methods and Buffers—Restriction enzyme digests, DNA ligations, site-directed mutagenesis, PCR, Southern blotting, and other recombinant DNA procedures were performed using standard protocols. All DNA constructs were verified by DNA sequencing, which was performed by The Sequencing Service, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, United Kingdom, using DYEnamic ET terminator chemistry (Amersham Biosciences) on Applied Biosystems automated DNA sequencers. Lysis buffer consisted of: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (by mass) Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.27 m sucrose, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and “Complete” proteinase inhibitor mixture (one tablet/50 ml). Construction of the Targeting Vectors—For construction of the minigene and inversion cassette targeting constructs, 129sv mouse BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) clone containing exons 2–6 of the mouse PDK1 gene was used as a backbone to PCR amplify the 5′ homology arm from a EcoRI/NdeI 5-kb region containing exon 2, and the 3′ homology arm from a HindIII/SpeI 2 kb region 3′ to exon 4. Both the 5′ and the 3′ homology arms were the same in both constructs. Appropriate primers were used to introduce a new EcoRV restriction site at the 3′-end of the 5′-arm for Southern screening purposes. The phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK)-thymidine kinase (TK)-pA cassette was included and the end of the 3′-arm for negative selection. For the minigene method, a targeting vector was constructed to insert a minigene cassette and a neomycin resistance cassette marker flanked by LoxP sites after exon 2 in the PDK1 gene and to mutate the codon in exon 4 of the endogenous PDK1 gene encoding Leu-155 to a Glu (Fig. 2B). The PDK1 minigene was PCR-derived from a PDK1 expressed sequence tag (GenBank™ accession number AA989806) and consisted of the cDNA corresponding to exons 3–14 and the intronic sequence 5′ to exon 3 to allow splicing. For the inversion cassette method, a targeting vector was constructed to replace the exons 3 and 4 in the PDK1 gene by an inversion cassette that contains the exon 3 and 4 fragment followed by a shorter and L155E-mutated version of the same exons 3 and 4-containing region cloned in an antiparallel orientation (supplemental Fig. 1). The inversion cassette was flanked by Lox66- and Lox71-modified LoxP sites in opposite orientations (7Zhang Z. Lutz B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e90Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The targeting construct also contained a neomycin resistance cassette flanked by a second Lox71 site. Further details of the sequence of these targeting constructs are available by request. The final knock-in constructs were purified on a cesium chloride gradient and were linearized using NotI before electroporation. ES Cell Targeting—E14.1 129/ola mouse ES cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, antibiotics (100 units of penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin), 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 25 ng/ml murine leukemia inhibitory factor. During the initial selections ES cells were maintained on a feeder layer of mitotically inactivated G418-resistant primary embryonic fibroblasts derived from MTK-Neo mice (16Stewart C.L. Schuetze S. Vanek M. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Targeting of the constructs to obtain heterozygous ES cells was performed using standard procedures (17Joyner A.L. Gene Targeting, A Practical Approach. IRL Press, 1993Google Scholar). Briefly, following electroporation, cells were plated in the absence of G418 for 48 h and then grown in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml G418 and 2 μm gancyclovir (thymidine kinase negative selection) for 10–14 days. Colonies were picked and cultured in the absence of G418 and gancyclovir. Targeted cell lines were identified by Southern blotting using an EcoRV digest of genomic DNA and a 0.7-kb 5′-probe (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. 1). For the minigene cassette construct, 12 of 228 clones analyzed were confirmed as correctly targeted (5% efficiency), and for the inversion cassette screening 18 of 230 cell lines screened were positive (8% efficiency). To test the efficiency of inversion in the PDK1IC/+ ES cells, 1 × 107 cells were transfected with 30, 45, and 60 μg of pMC-CrePuro, which encodes for puromycin resistance and Cre recombinase, by electroporation using a Bio-Rad GENE PULSER II, set at 240 V and 500 μF. The pMC-CrePuro plasmid was prepared by cloning the blunted AscI fragment of pKO SelectPuro (Stratagene) containing the puromycin gene under the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter into the blunted HindIII site of pMC-Cre (18Gu H. Zou Y.R. Rajewsky K. Cell. 1993; 73: 1155-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). The cells were plated out onto gelatinized tissue culture plastic, and puromycin was added to the medium at a concentration of 2 μg/ml during days 2–4. On day 4 the cells were trypsinized and seeded at low density (1000 cells/10-cm dish), and colonies were picked in duplicate into 96-well tissue culture plates. One plate was subjected to PCR analysis using primers ic1 (5′-CACATCAGGAAGCCACTGGCTTAAGC-3′), ic2 (5′-CTTCCTCTTGCAAAACCACACTGCTCG-3′), and ic3 (5′-GTGCTCTGTGTGGAGAACATTCTGGA-3′) as described in supplemental Fig. 1. The other plate was used for expansion of positive ES cells. PCR yielded a product of 260 bp for the recombinant noninverted allele and a 314-bp product for the inverted one. Some of the clones were further confirmed by Southern analysis as described in supplemental Fig. 1. Generation of PDK1MG/+ Mice and Genotyping Analysis—All animal studies and breeding performed in this study were approved by the University of Dundee ethical committee and performed under a UK Home Office project license. Heterozygous knock-in PDK1MG/+ ES cell clones were microinjected into C57Black6 × Balb/c blastocysts, which were then reimplanted into recipient female mice. Chimeric mice that had a high degree of ES cell contribution were identified by a champagne color and were then crossed to C57Black6 mice. Genotyping of PDK1MG/+ mice was carried out by PCR of genomic DNA isolated from ear biopsy using primers P1 (5′-GGAACTTACTCTGTAGACCAGGCTG-3′) and P2 (5′-GACGTGTCCTAATACTACCACAAGTGGC-3′). As depicted in Fig. 2B, primers P1 and P2 result in a 171-bp product from the wild type allele and a 212-bp product from the targeted allele. PDK1MG/+ mice were crossed to transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under muscle creatine kinase promoter (MckCre) (19Bruning J.C. Michael M.D. Winnay J.N. Hayashi T. Horsch D. Accili D. Goodyear L.J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 559-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar) employing the strategy outlined in the legend for Fig. 2B. For the detection of Cre the following primers were employed: Cre1 (5′-AAATGGTTTCCCGCAGAACC-3′) and Cre10 (5′-TAGCTGGCTGGTGGCAGATG-3′). For the heterozygous method, experimental PDK1fl/L155ECre+/– and control PDK1fl/L155ECre–/– mice were obtained as described in the legend for Fig. 2A. The floxed and knock-out alleles were detected with primers p80, p99, and p100r as described previously (20Lawlor M.A. Mora A. Ashby P.R. Williams M.R. Murray-Tait V. Malone L. Prescott A.R. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3728-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and the L155E allele was detected with the p1 and p2 primers described by Collins et al. (13Collins B.J. Deak M. Arthur J.S. Armit L.J. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4202-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). RNA Extraction and RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from the ventricles of mice with the indicated genotype (Fig. 3D) using a Total RNA isolation kit (Macherey-Nagel). The Access RT-PCR System (Promega) was employed to amplify a 331-bp PDK1 cDNA region containing exons 3 and 4 with primers MGRT F (5′-AGCACCCTGCCCAGCTGCCACCACAG-3′) and MGRT R (5′-GCCAATTTTGCGGATGTATTTAAGTAGCTC-3′), which flank the XmaI restriction polymorphic site and the triplet coding for the residue 155. The DNA band was cloned, and 30 independent clones obtained from three independent PCR reactions were sequenced. Preparation of Tissue Extracts, Immunoblotting, and Protein Kinase Assays—Following an overnight fast, a bolus of insulin (150 milliunits/g) or saline solution was intraperitoneally injected to terminally anesthetized mice. At the indicated times, tissues were rapidly extracted, freeze-clamped in liquid nitrogen, stored at –80 °C, and homogenized to a powder in liquid nitrogen. A 10-fold mass excess of ice-cold lysis buffer was added to the powdered tissue, briefly vortexed, and then centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 13,000 × g to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was snap-frozen in aliquots in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. The activation state of PKB or S6K (in Figs. 4 and 5) was assessed by either immunoblotting the extracts (20 μg) with the indicated phosphospecific antibodies or following the immunoprecipitation of these enzymes from cell extracts and assaying their activity using the Crosstide peptide (GRPRTSSFAEG) as described previously (21Williams M.R. Arthur J.S. Balendran A. van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3, PDK1 was affinity-purified on PIF-Sepharose from 0.5 mg of tissue lysates as described previously (13Collins B.J. Deak M. Arthur J.S. Armit L.J. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4202-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of streptavidin-Sepharose was conjugated to 0.5 μg of biotinylated PIF peptide (biotin-C6 spacer-REPRILSEEEQEMFRDFAYIADWC) and incubated with the lysates. The beads were resuspended in 20 μl of lysis buffer to which 5 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer was added. The samples were electrophoresed and then immunoblotted. Glucose transport in isolated skeletal muscle was performed as described previously (22Sakamoto K. McCarthy A. Smith D. Green K.A. Grahame Hardie D. Ashworth A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1810-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar).FIGURE 5PDK1 signaling in minigene knock-in mice. Mice were fasted overnight and intraperitoneally injected with either saline (for the 0 min time point control) or 150 milliunits/g insulin for 10, 20, and 40 min. Skeletal muscle (A and B), cardiac muscle (C), or adipose tissue (D) was then rapidly extracted and frozen in liquid nitrogen. A, C, and D, PKB or S6K were immunoprecipitated from the indicated extracts, and the activity was measured using a quantitative peptide phosphorylation assay. Each point represents the mean activity ± S.E. of three different samples with each assayed in triplicate. B, the cell lysates from skeletal muscle extracts were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies; each lane represents a different mouse.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Generation of PDK1[L155E] Knock-in Mice—The goal of this study was to evaluate whether the heterozygous (Fig. 1A), minigene (Fig. 1B), and inversion cassette (Fig. 1C) methods could be employed to generate conditional knock-in mice that express mutant PDK1[L155E] rather than wild type PDK1 in muscle tissues. For the heterozygous method described previously, mice in which the wild type PDK1 allele was flanked with LoxP sites (PDK1fl/fl) (20Lawlor M.A. Mora A. Ashby P.R. Williams M.R. Murray-Tait V. Malone L. Prescott A.R. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3728-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) were bred with PDK1L155E/+ knock-in mice (14McManus E.J. Collins B.J. Ashby P.R. Prescott A.R. Murray-Tait V. Armit L.J. Arthur J.S. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2071-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) to generate PDK1fl/L155E animals (Fig. 2A), which were in turn crossed with transgenic mice expressing the Cre recombinase under the Mck promoter (which induces expression of the Cre recombinase specifically in skeletal muscle and heart just prior to birth (19Bruning J.C. Michael M.D. Winnay J.N. Hayashi T. Horsch D. Accili D. Goodyear L.J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 559-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar)). In the resulting PDK1fl/L155EMckCre+/– mice, exons 3 and 4 would be deleted in muscle, ablating functional PDK1 expression, as this truncation prevents translation of the entire kinase catalytic domain and subsequent portion of the protein (21Williams M.R. Arthur J.S. Balendran A. van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar); and expression of PDK1 would occur only from the L155E knock-in allele, which is not flanked with LoxP sites. These animals were viable (Fig. 3A) and displayed no phenotype. For the minigene method the targeting construct and PDK1MG/MG mice were generated as described in the legend for Fig. 2B and under “Experimental Procedures.” The PDK1MG/MG mice were crossed with MckCre mice (Fig. 2B), and the resultant PDK1MG/MGMckCre+/– mice were viable (Fig. 3A), of normal size, and displayed no other apparent phenotype. For the inversion method a targeting construct (described in supplemental Fig. 1) was generated. We observed a tendency for the DNA construct to undergo recombination in Escherichia coli, due to the presence of palindromic sequence. To circumvent this problem, the targeting construct was designed to minimize the amount of palindromic sequence. We next targeted ES cells with this construct and were able to isolate 18 independent clones of correctly targeted PDK1IC/+ ES cells by Southern blot analysis (supplemental Fig. 1). Prior to generating mice with these ES cell lines, we verified whether transfection of three independently targeted ES cell lines with CRE recombinase induced the expected inversion of the DNA cassette contained within the modified LoxP sites. We analyzed over 400 PDK1IC/+ ES cells that expressed the CRE recombinase but found that no inversion had occurred in any of the cells. We also found that in E. coli expressing the Cre recombinase, the efficiency of inversion of the DNA cassette within our construct, although detectable, was low. Because of the poor efficiency of inversion observed, we were unable to pursue our analysis of the inversion method; this will be discussed further under “Discussion.” Expression of PDK1 in Knock-in Mice—We found that PDK1 is expressed at near wild type levels in skeletal muscle of PDK1fl/flMckCre–/– and PDK1fl/155EMckCre–/– mice not expressing Cre recombinase. In PDK1fl/155EMckCre+/– muscle, consistent with excision of the allele encoding wild type PDK1, the level of PDK1 protein was moderately lower than observed in the muscle of littermate PDK1fl/155EMckCre–/– animals (Fig. 3B). To distinguish between the expression of wild type PDK1 and mutant PDK1[L155E], we incubated muscle extracts with Sepharose conjugated to the PIF peptide, which interacts strongly with the PIF pocket of wild type PDK1 but cannot interact with mutant PDK1[L155E] (10Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 23Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). PDK1 could be affinity-purified from PDK1fl/flMckCre–/– and PDK1fl/155EMckCre–/– muscle but not from the PDK1fl/155EMckCre+/– tissue (Fig. 3B), confirming that mutant PDK1[L155E] rather than wild type PDK1 was expressed. As a control, we demonstrated that in the liver tissue of the PDK1fl/155EMckCre+/– mice, which does not express Cre, PDK1 could be affinity-purified. The analysis of PDK1 expression in muscle tissues of PDK1MG/MGMckCre–/– and PDK1MG/MGMckCre+/– mice indicated that PDK1 levels were slightly higher than observed in wild type control muscle (Fig. 3C). Using the PIF-Sepharose pulldown assay, we were unable to detect wild type PDK1 protein in the muscle of PDK1MG/MGMckCre+/– mice. This indicated that we had succeeded in the goal of generating mice that express near normal levels of mutant PDK1[L155E] rather than wild type PDK1 in muscle tissues employing the minigene method. Unexpectedly, however, when analyzing the muscle tissue of littermate control PDK1MG/MGMckCre–/– mice, despite the absence of Cre, we observed that the mutant PDK1[L155E] was also expressed at a significant level, as indicated by the lower level of PDK1 in the PIF-Sepharose pulldown assay (Fig. 3C). To analyze further the expression of wild type PDK1 and PDK1[L155E], the mRNA for PDK1 was amplified by RT-PCR from cardiac muscle and then cloned, and the region corresponding to the L155E mutation was sequenced. This revealed that in PDK1MG/MGMckCre–/– mice, similar amounts of mRNA for wild type PDK1 (corresponding to splicing onto the minigene) and PDK1[L155E] (corresponding to splicing across the minigene from exons 2–3) were expressed (Fig. 3D). This indicates that despite the presence of three polyadenylation transcription termination sequences within the minigene/neomycin cassette (Fig. 3D), transcription did not efficiently terminate and continued into the knock-in region of the gene. Moreover, to obtain expression of PDK1[L155E] protein in non-Cre-expressing cells, splicing must hav"

Fig. 1 shows the subunit structure of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (pol II), of the Pyrococcus RNAP and of the RNAP from Escherichia coli. Homologous subunits are indicated by the same colors. Archaeal RNAP display greater similarities with all eukaryotic RNAP than with the four subunits of the bacterial core enzyme. We refer here mainly to pol II as the subunit interactions within this enzyme are known from the crystal structure (1Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D.

In the genomes of most Archaea, the gene encoding E overlaps at its 3′-end in a different reading frame with a second gene containing a zinc finger motif. To discriminate between the first gene that is homologous to rpb7 and the second gene that has no homolog in yeast but is highly conserved in Archaea, the first one is designated in data bases as rpoE′ and the second one as rpoE″, and the corresponding proteins as E′ and E″. Only E′ has been detected in purified archaeal RNAP. Two subunits shared by all three eukaryotic RNAP, Rpb12, and Rpb10 have the subunits P and N as archaeal homologues but no bacterial homologues. In addition, subunit H of the archaeal enzyme has a homologue in pol II (and also in pol I and pol III) but not in the bacterial enzyme.The gene encoding the largest subunit in eukaryotic RNAP, Rpo1 and β′ of the E. coli enzyme is split into two genes encoding subunits A′ and A″ in all Archaea. The RNAP of Pyrococcus and of Crenarchaeota show the subunit composition BA′A″ DE′FLHNKP (4Lanzendörfer M. Langer D. Hain J. Klenk H.P. Holz I. Arnold-Ammer I. Zillig W. System. Appl.

Gerardy-Schahn R. Zillig W. Stetter K.O. Huet J. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 751-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This B split defines the second major type of archaeal RNAP with the subunit composition A′B′B″A″DE′FLHNPK.The archaeal RNAP is recruited to the preinitiation complex by association to promoter-bound transcription factors TBP and TFB (7Hausner W.

Ouhammouch M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1397-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Both TBP and TFB consist of two imperfect direct repeats. TFB has in addition an N-terminal domain forming a zinc ribbon and a B-finger (see Figs. 6C, 9, and 10). A third archaeal transcription factor, TFE, is homologous to the N-terminal part of subunit α of eukaryotic TFIIE (11Bell S.D. Brinkman A.B. van der Oost J. Jackson S.P. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Hanzelka B.L. Darcy T.J. Reeve J.N. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1813-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). TFE is not required for promoter-directed transcription but can stimulate the activity of some promoters by a factor of 3–4. TFE can also complement some mutants of TFB indicating that these proteins interact synergistically and contribute to catalytic core functions of RNAP (10Werner F. Weinzierl R.O.J. Mol. Cell.

These studies revealed that subunit B of Pyrococcus RNAP cross-links the RNAP between the TATA-box and the transcription start site and that subunits A′, A″, and H contact the DNA downstream of the start site. In vivo and in vitro binding assays were used to investigate the interactions of subunits of the RNAP from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii. The eukaryotic subunits Rpb4 and Rbp7 form a heterodimer that reversibly associated with the pol II core. As predicted from the similarity to the eukaryotic system the archaeal homologues of these polypeptides, E and F, form a complex (3Todone F. Brick P. Werner F. Weinzierl R.O.J. Onesti S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1137-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and archaeal F interacted with human Rpb7 to form an archaeal-human F-Rpb7 hybrid (16Werner F. Eloranta J.J. Weinzierl R.O.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4299-4305Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Subunits D, L, N, and P were shown to associate to a tetrameric D-L-N-P complex (16Werner F. Eloranta J.J. Weinzierl R.O.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4299-4305Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic homologues of these subunits, Rbp3, Rpb10, Rpb11, and Rpb12 are in close interaction and clustered together in the pol II structure (1Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). This assembly of the archaeal subunits D-L-N-P was able to recruit the largest subunit B in vitro and used as a frame for the reconstitution of active M. jannaschii RNAP from individual subunits (17Werner F. Weinzierl R.O.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).We are exploring the mechanism and regulation of transcription in Pyrococcus using a cell-free transcription system (7Hausner W.

The interaction of these polypeptides with each other and with the archaeal transcription factors TBP and TFB were studied by far-Western analyses, column chromatography and gel electrophoresis. Our results reveal many interactions predicted from the structural similarities to the pol II system, the existence of various subcomplexes and an interaction of the BDLNP subcomplex with promoter-bound TBP and TFB.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of RNAP Subunits—The coding region of RNAP subunits B (PF1564), A′(PF1563), A″ (PF1562), D (PF1647), E′ (PF02569, F (PF1036), H (PF1565), K (PF1642), L (PF0050), N (PF16439 and P, (PF2009) from Pyrococcus furiosus DSMZ 3638, were PCR-amplified using genomic DNA as template. The oligonucleotides were complementary to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the genes and contained the restrictions sites NdeI at the 5′-end and BamHI at the 3′-end. The PCR fragments encoding subunits B, D, E′, F, L, H, K, and P were cloned into the corresponding restriction sites of the expression vector pET-33b (Novagen). The expressed proteins carry a His6 tag and a recognition site for heart muscle kinase (HMK) at the N terminus. The PCR products encoding subunits F and H were also cloned in a modified version of pET-33b resulting in proteins containing the His6 tag and the HMK site at the C terminus. Details of the modified vector and of the oligonucleotide sequences are available from the authors on request. The PCR fragments encoding subunits A′ and A″ were cloned in the NdeI site and BamHI site of pET-14b. The expressed subunits A′ and A″ contained only a His6 tag at the N terminus and were used as targets in Far-Western experiments. To obtain subunits A′ and A″ with a HMK site in addition, the PCR products containing the HMK recognition site at the 5′-end were cloned into pET151/D-TOPO (Invitrogen).Identification of a Consensus Sequence for Subunits of Archaeal RNAP and Bioinformatic Work—Multiple sequence alignments of the genes encoding RNAP subunits of up to 18 Archaea and of the subunits of pol II from S. cerevisiae revealed an amino acid consensus sequence for each subunit with the exception of Rbp8 and Rpb9, which have no homologues in Archaea. Most of the genes encoding archaeal RNAP subunits were extracted from whole genome files available at NCBI or at SRS. BLAST search and other common bioinformatic resources were used to identify unannotated entries. A number of missing genes became available by local BLAST search in Bioedit on the basis of the whole genome file in raw format. Multiple sequence alignments were carried out using Malign, an algorithm especially suitable when genes are compared that show low sequence similarities and different lengths (scoring matrix: PAM250). Because subunit B is split in two parts in several Archaea (rpoB′and rpoB″) two single alignment steps were carried out and combined in a subsequent step to obtain better results. MAlign2Msf was used to convert the data into the MSF file type. After import into Bioedit the data were formatted, a consensus sequence was generated and shading was applied. As final step export as RTF file and import into MS Word was performed. The consensus sequence of each alignment was also used to generate two-dimensional similarity diagrams (Fig. 3) and to visualize the distribution of identities and similarities in the three-dimensional model of S. cerevisiae polII (PDB: 1NT9; Fig. 4). A small Delphi program was written to draw the two-dimensional diagrams and as a helper tool for sequence analysis and various conversion steps. In the diagrams a vertical line represents identity between the archaeal consensus and the amino acid sequence of pol II. Lines of half-length indicate similarities. To visualize the homologous regions of archaeal RNAPs and of pol II in the three-dimensional structure of pol II, the consensus sequence for each subunit was converted in a ProSite search pattern and applied to the S. cerevisiae pol II model (PDB: 1NT9) using the Cn3D 4.1 annotate function.FIGURE 3The consensus of archaeal RNAP subunits shows extensive homology to domains of the active core of pol II. The consensus sequence for the genes encoding archaeal RNAP subunits was aligned with the homologous eukaryotic subunits. The genes encoding the subunits of yeast pol II are shown in the top lane of each panel. DNA regions conserved in the consensus of the archaeal RNAP subunit are indicated in the pol II gene by full-length black bars (identical with archaeal consensus) and half-length bars (similar to archaeal consensus).

The proteins were expressed by inducing exponentially cultures with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. For Far-Western dot blot experiments (Fig. 5A, first three panels), subunit B was purified after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel slices containing this subunit were incubated in a solution containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS. Then, SDS was precipitated and the protein refolded by dilution and dialysis as described by Ref. 21Burgess R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Subunit B used as probe (Fig. 5A, lower panel) for dot blots and B used for gel blots and for reconstitution of the DLNPB subcomplex and subunits A′and A″ were renatured from inclusion bodies. First, cells were suspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.3 mg/ml lysozyme) and sonicated. After centrifugation the pellets containing the inclusion bodies were extensively washed in purification buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm PMSF, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) The inclusion bodies were solubilized in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 6 m guanidine HCl, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 1 h at 20 °C. After centrifugation the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA column (HisTrapFF, GE healthcare) and washed with binding buffer containing 6 m urea and no guanidine HCl. The refolding of the bound protein was performed on column using a decreasing linear urea gradient (10 column volumes) ranging from 6 m to 0. The refolded proteins were eluted with an imidazole gradient ranging from 5 to 300 mm imidazole. For the purification of subunits D, L, N, E′, F, K, H, and P cells were resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm NaPO4, pH 8, 10 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, and 10% v/v glycerol. Cells were disrupted by passage through a French pressure cell. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was directly applied to a Ni2+-NTA column (subunits D, E′, K) or after heating for 20 min at 80 °C (subunits F, H, L, N, and P) and separation of precipitated E. coli proteins by centrifugation. Bound proteins were stepwise eluted with 300 mm imidazole. Some subunits were further purified by MonoQ- or Superdex75-chromatography.FIGURE 5Interactions of isolated RNAP subunits analyzed by Far-Western blotting.

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dot blot-solubilized proteins were spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Optitran BA-S 85 Reinforced NC, Schleicher and Schüll, order number 439196). The affinity of RNAP subunits to bind to the membrane and/or to detach from the membrane during the following incubations steps differed considerably. In particular subunit B and H showed a tendency to detach from the membrane during the following incubation. This detachment was inhibited by drying the membranes after spotting of the proteins briefly at 50 °C. To control the amount of proteins used for the protein-protein interactions studies proteins were spotted in parallel on two membranes for each experiments and one membrane was stained with Ponceau S and the second used for the Dot Blot. 0.5 to 3 μg of protein was spotted for each individual subunit onto the membrane to obtain similar signals with Ponceau S staining. In particular the amount of subunits A′, A″, F, and H added to the membrane was higher, but also somewhat higher amounts of subunits B, P, and purified RNAP were spotted onto the membrane to obtain similar staining signals with Ponceau S. After drying the membrane used for the dot blot was blocked and subunit B refolded by incubation overnight in probing buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2; 200 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol; 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20, 1% (w/v) nonfat-dried milk and 10% (v/v) glycerol (23Burgess R.R. Arthur T.M. Pietz B.C. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After probing and autoradiography the amount of protein on the membrane was controlled by staining with Ponceau S.Gel Blot—Cloned RNAP subunits or purified RNAP were electrophoretically transferred (Semidry system Bio-Rad) after SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis to nitrocellulose membranes (PROTRAN BA75 0.05 μm; Schleicher and Schüll, order number 10402196). Proteins on the membrane were refolded by incubation overnight in probing buffer. The transfer of proteins onto the membranes was verified after probing and autoradiography by staining with Ponceau S.Labeling of Probes—70 pmol RNAP subunit was incubated with 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and 10 units of HMK (Novagen) in a total volume of 10 μl of the buffer supplied with the enzyme for 70 min at 30 °C.Probing—The blocked nitrocellulose membrane was incubated in 10 ml of probing buffer containing 10 μCi of 32P-labeled RNAP subunits for 2 h at 4–8°C. The blot was washed two times in probing buffer dried and exposed to a Phosphoimager (FLA-5000, Fuji).Electrophoresis under Non-denaturating Conditions—Interactions of subunits D and L and E′ and F were investigated by electrophoresis in native 8–15% polyacrylamide gels as described in Ref. 24Ehlers C.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1028-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar.Reconstitution of BDLNP RNAP Subcomplexes—Equimolar amounts (2.5 nmol) of RNAP subunits were incubated in transcription buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 250 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 1 h at 20°C. The complex formation was analyzed by Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) column chromatography. Alternatively, the BDLNP complex was reconstituted by denaturation and renaturation of recombinant subunits. 2.5 nmol of subunits B and D and 5 nmol of subunits N, L, and P were combined in a final volume of 500 μl of transcription buffer containing in addition 6 m urea. The mixture was transferred to a dialysis frame (Slide-A-Lyzer 3.5k, Pierce) and incubated for 20 min at 20 °C. Then, the mixture was dialyzed against transcription buffer containing 3 m urea for 20 min at 20 °C. Renaturation was achieved by dialysis in transcription buffer for 1 h. The renaturated subcomplexes were heated for 10 min at 70 °C to remove misfolded aggregates. The BDLNP subcomplex was purified by Superdex 200 chromatography (Superdex 200 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The DNA sequence of the P. furiosus gdh promoter was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR. 90 bp of 32P-labeled DNA fragments encoding the promoter region from position –60 to + 30 were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (MBI Fermentas) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The labeled DNA was purified using mini Quick Spin Columns (Qiagen). DNA binding reactions were conducted for 30 min at 70 °C in a 12.5-μl volume of transcription buffer containing in addition 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 240 nm TBP, 60 nm TFB, and 8.6 nm RNAP, or 100 nm BDLNP subcomplex. The reactions were loaded onto a native 4% polyacrylamide gel (buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), electrophoresed at room temperature and analyzed by phosphorimaging.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe Archaeal RNAP Displays High Sequence Similarity with the Catalytic Core of Pol II—To investigate the molecular architecture of an archaeal RNAP we cloned and expressed 11 subunits of the Pyrococcus RNAP (Figs. 1 and 2) ranging in molecular mass from 127 003 (subunit B) to 5757 (subunit P).

Here, we report that Fyn, NFAT, and ERK signaling influence ICOS expression as various chemical inhibitors, such as PP2 that targets Src kinases, U0126 that targets MEK1/2, and cyclosporin A or FK506 that targets calcineurin and thereby affects NFAT, attenuate T cell receptor-mediated ICOS induction. Moreover, ectopic expression of NFATc2 or a constitutively active MEK2 amplifies ICOS transcription and transactivates a 288-bp core region of the icos promoter in luciferase reporter assays. We also identify a site on the icos promoter that is sensitive to ERK signaling and further show that NFATc2 can bind the icos promoter in vivo and that this binding is diminished when Fyn signaling is ablated. The normal activation of ERK but reduced nuclear translocation of NFATc2 in Fyn–/– CD4+ T cells further suggest that Fyn and NFATc2 act in a common axis, separate from that involving ERK, to drive ICOS transcription.

The costimulation signal is critical in maintaining the full activation status of antigen-stimulated T cells by sustaining their cellular proliferation and differentiation, thus preventing onset of anergy and induction of apoptosis. The CD28 family of molecules are type I transmembrane glycoproteins and possess putative Src homology 2 and 3 motifs in their cytoplasmic tails for signal transduction. The prototypic member, CD28, is expressed constitutively on naive T cells and engaged by the B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) molecules on antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages, B cells, and dendritic cells. Cognate interaction between CD28 and B7-1 and B7-2 ligands will lead to IL-2 transcription (3Civil A. Verweij C.L. Res. Immunol. 1995; 146: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), expression of CD25 (IL-2Rα), and entry into cell cycle as well as induced expression of the cell survival protein Bcl-XL in T cells (4Burr J.S. Savage N.D. Messah G.E. Kimzey S.L. Shaw A.S. Arch R.H. Green J.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5331-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Another CD28 family member, CTLA-4, acts as a negative regulator in this co-stimulatory pathway by competing for binding to the same B7 ligands and thereby inhibiting IL-2 synthesis and cell cycle progression and thus terminating T cell responses (2Frauwirth K.A. Thompson C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Although CD28 is the predominant costimulatory molecule, it does not account for all costimulatory functions in T cells. Mice lacking CD28 are still able to mount effective responses to some viruses (5Whitmire J.K. Ahmed R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the production of effector cytokines such as inteferon-γ and IL-4 can still be stimulated to normal levels by antigen-presenting cells lacking B7 ligands (6Schweitzer A.N. Borriello F. Wong R.C. Abbas A.K. Sharpe A.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2713-2722PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to naive T cells, the reactivation of antigen-experienced T cells also appears to be less dependent on CD28/B7 interaction (7London C.A. Lodge M.P. Abbas A.K. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 8Lucas P.J. Negishi I. Nakayama K. Fields L.E. Loh D.Y. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5757-5768PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that other costimulatory molecules can compensate for the lack of CD28 signaling. One candidate is the recently discovered inducible costimulator (ICOS), which is also a member of the CD28 family of receptors. ICOS shares 30–40% sequence similarity to CD28 and CTLA-4 but does not have the conserved extracellular MYP-PPY motif necessary for binding B7-1 and B7-2 (9Beier K.C. Hutloff A. Dittrich A.M.

Instead, it binds a different cell surface molecule known as ICOS ligand (ICOSL, also termed B7h, B7RP-1, GL-50, LICOS, or B7-H2) that is expressed constitutively on B cells and at low levels on monocytes and whose expression can be induced in fibroblasts, nonlymphoid tissues, and other nonprofessional antigen-presenting cells (11Swallow M.M.

Nature. 1999; 402: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). ICOS is expressed in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and may play a more important role in costimulating effector and memory T cells as compared with naive T cells (13Gonzalo J.A. Tian J. Delaney T.

ICOS engagement in vitro can contribute to the production of cytokines, such as IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10, but little IL-2 (9Beier K.C. Hutloff A. Dittrich A.M. Heuck C.

Recent studies also indicate that in the absence of CD28, ICOS appears to assume the major T cell costimulatory role for humoral immune responses (15Suh W.K. Tafuri A. Berg-Brown N.N. Shahinian A.

Characterization of ICOS-deficient mice revealed that the absence of ICOS impaired humoral immune responses by affecting germinal center (GC) formation and B cell immunoglobulin class switching (16Dong C.

Consistent with a pivotal role for ICOS in GC development, ICOS has been implicated in the maintenance of CXCR5+ follicular B helper T cells in vivo (20Akiba H. Takeda K. Kojima Y. Usui Y. Harada N. Yamazaki T. Ma J. Tezuka K. Yagita H. Okumura K. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 2340-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Human ICOS deficiency, on the other hand, results in a clinical phenotype indistinguishable from that of adult onset common variable immunodeficiency (21Grimbacher B. Hutloff A. Schlesier M. Glocker E. Warnatz K. Drager R. Eibel H. Fischer B. Schaffer A.A. Mages H.W. Kroczek R.A. Peter H.H. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 22Warnatz K.

Blood. 2005; 107: 3045-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The importance of ICOS/ICOSL in costimulating immune reactions can be glimpsed from various murine disease models. In the examples of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and cardiac allograft transplantation, ICOS blockade could abrogate immunopathogenesis or prolong allograft survival, respectively (23Harada H. Salama A.D. Sho M. Izawa A. Sandner S.E. Ito T. Akiba H. Yagita H. Sharpe A.H. Freeman G.J. Sayegh M.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 234-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 24Rottman J.B.

Moreover, interference of the ICOS-ICOSL pathway has also been shown to result in the resolution of mercury-induced autoimmunity (25Zheng Y. Jost M. Gaughan J.P. Class R. Coyle A.J. Monestier M. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 3117-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Last, but not least, ICOS/ICOSL interactions have also been implicated in Th2-mediated allergic diseases, such as airway hypersensitivity (26Akbari O. Freeman G.J. Meyer E.H. Greenfield E.A. Chang T.T. Sharpe A.H. Berry G. DeKruyff R.H. Umetsu D.T. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1024-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), allergy and asthma (27Coyle A.J. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 2004; 25: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and acute or chronic graft versus host disease (28Ozkaynak E. Gao W. Shemmeri N. Wang C. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Amaral J. Qin S. Rottman J.B. Coyle A.J. Hancock W.W. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Despite extensive studies pointing to a crucial role for ICOS in cellular and humoral immunity, little is known about the regulation of ICOS expression. ICOS is absent or expressed at low levels on naive T cells and is rapidly up-regulated upon T cell activation (19Tafuri A. Shahinian A. Bladt F. Yoshinaga S.K. Jordana M. Wakeham A. Boucher L.M. Bouchard D. Chan V.S. Duncan G. Odermatt B. Ho A. Itie A. Horan T. Whoriskey J.S. Pawson T. Penninger J.M. Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W.

It is envisaged that the ability to enhance ICOS expression at the appropriate time could lead to more effective immune responses against pathogens. Conversely, the ability to down-regulate ICOS expression could modulate the rejection of organ and tissue transplantation and alleviate the severity of autoimmune diseases. Hence, in the present study, we elucidated the signaling pathways originating from TCR and CD28 costimulation that lead to ICOS induction as well as delineate the cis-acting regulatory region and trans-acting transcription factors (TFs) that govern ICOS transcription. We found that the Fyn-calcineurin-NFATc2 and MEK2-ERK1/2 signaling pathways operate independently but converge on the icos core promoter to induce ICOS transcription. Mouse Strains, Cell Lines, Antibodies, and Chemical Inhibitors—Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the Singapore Biological Resource Centre. B6.129S7-Fyntm1Sor/J (Fyn–/–) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. All mice were bred and used between 8 and 12 weeks of age according to institutional guidelines. The murine EL4 thymoma cell line was maintained in complete RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 mg/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, 100 mm HEPES, and 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Anti-CD3 (145-2C11) and anti-CD28 (37.51) antibodies for cell stimulation, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD4 (GK1.5), anti-CD8 (53-6.7), and biotin-conjugated anti-ICOS (7E.17G9) antibodies and PE-Cy5-conjugated streptavidin for flow cytometric staining were obtained from BD Biosciences. Chemical inhibitors FK506 (10 μm), CsA (low dose, 5 ng/ml; high dose, 50 ng/ml), wortmannin (100 nm), and rapamycin (10 nm) were obtained from Sigma. PP2 (5 μm), damnacanthal (100 nm), piceatannol (50 μm), SB203580 (10 μm), JNK inhibitor I (5 μm), and NF-κB competitor peptide SN50 (10 μm) were purchased from Calbiochem. U0126 (50 μm) was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). CD4+ T Cell Purification, Activation, and Flow Cytometric Analyses—Single cell suspensions were prepared from lymph nodes and spleens of Fyn+/+ and Fyn–/– mice and treated with red blood cell lysing solution (0.15 m NH4Cl and 0.1 mm Na2EDTA) for 5 min at 4 °C to eliminate erythrocytes. CD4+ T cells were positively isolated using anti-CD4 antibody (monoclonal antibody)-coupled magnetic cell-sorting microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) to more than 95% purity (as analyzed by flow cytometric staining with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies). Purified CD4+ T cells (5 × 105) were either untreated or seeded into 24-well tissue culture plates precoated with 1 μg/ml anti-CD3 and 4 μg/ml soluble anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies. In some experiments, CD4+ T cells were incubated with chemical inhibitors 1 h prior to activation. Cells were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated anti-CD4 and anti-ICOS antibodies and analyzed on a FACS- can using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). RNA Isolation and Real Time RT-PCR Analyses—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol and treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) to avoid DNA contamination; cDNA was prepared using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with oligo(dT)12–18 as primer. Primers used for real time PCR were as follows: ICOS, 5′-TGA CCC ACC TCC TTT TCA AG-3′ and 5′-TTA GGG TCA TGC ACA CTG GA-3′; β-actin, 5′-GAT CTG GCA CCA CAC CTT CT-3′ and 5′-ACC AGA GGC ATA CAG GGA CA-3′. Each reaction (95 °C, 2 min; 95 °C, 10 s; 60 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s, 40 cycles) was performed using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in a Mx3000P QPCR System (Stratagene). All experiments were repeated twice, mRNA levels of ICOS were normalized against β-actin, and mRNA levels in treated cells were expressed as -fold change relative to those in untreated cells. Statistical analysis (unpaired two-tailed Student's t test) was performed with PRISM software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells (2–5 × 106) were lysed on ice for 15 min in buffer containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 12 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were sequentially incubated with 2–2.5 μg of appropriate antibodies and protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Following determination of protein concentrations using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), the samples were loaded in appropriate amounts and electrophoresed in a 7–10% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with Abs that recognize specific proteins. Protein bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-coupled Abs and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate System; Pierce). Antibodies against phospho-ERK (E-4), ERK2 (C-14), NFATc2 (G1-D10), and TFIID (58C9) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Plasmid Constructs, Transient Transfections, and Luciferase Reporter Assays—The icos promoter, spanning –1478 to –1 relative to the first nucleotide of the mouse cDNA (NCBI GenBank™ accession number NM_017480) was amplified from C57BL/6 mouse genomic DNA by PCR using primers carrying restriction sites for KpnI and HindIII (5′-GAG CAG TCA TTG AGA GGC CAG AAG AG-3′ and 5′-CCC AAG CTT AGT GCT CAA AAG TGT CAG-3′) and cloned into the promoterless luciferase plasmid vector, pGL3-Basic (pGL3B; Promega, Madison, WI) to create mICOSp(–1478)-Luc. 5′ deletion mutants of this promoter fragment were either generated after suitable restriction enzyme digestion and religated into pGL3B or subcloned by nested PCR to create mICOSp(–900)-Luc, mICOSp(–599)-Luc, mICOSp(–471)-Luc, mICOSp(–288)-Luc, mICOSp(–147)-Luc, mICOSp(–109)-Luc, and mICOSp(–52)-Luc. A 3-bp region, CTT, between bp 142 and 144 within mICOSp(–288)-Luc was replaced by AGA using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to create mICOSp(–288)-ERK-mut-Luc. The same protocol was used to replace a 2-bp section, CC, between bp 231 and 232 with AA in mICOS(–288)-Luc to generate mICOSp(–288)-NFAT-mut-Luc. 0.98 μg of the luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.02 μg of pRL-TK (Renilla) plasmid (50:1 ratio) were premixed in OPTI-MEM I reduced serum medium (Invitrogen) and transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in triplicate into EL4 cells seeded in 24-well flat bottom plates at 1 × 106 cells/ml in 0.5 ml of RPMI 1640 medium without antibiotics. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 4 h before stimulation with 10 ng/ml PMA and 0.5 μg/ml ionomycin. Cells were cultured for another 14–16 h and harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were solubilized in passive lysis buffer (Promega) and incubated on a Spiramix roller mixer for 15 min at room temperature. 20 μl of cell lysate was assayed for both firefly and Renilla luciferase activities using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega), and relative light units (RLU) were measured in a TD-20/20 single tube luminometer (Turner BioSystems, Sunnyvale, CA). RLU from the firefly luciferase was normalized for transfection efficiency to the Renilla luciferase RLU in each lysate (normalized RLU = RLUfirefly luciferase/RLURenilla luciferase). For icos promoter analysis, the activity of a reporter construct following stimulation was calculated as follows: reporter activity = normalized RLUstimulated/normalized RLUunstimulated. For the effect of overexpressed proteins on icos promoter activity, the -fold induction was calculated as follows: -Fold induction = normalized RLUprotein-expressing vector, unstimulated or stimulated/normalized RLUnull vector, unstimulated. The pUSEamp vector expressing a constitutively active form of MEK2 (S222D/S226D double mutant) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The pBJ5 and pBJ5-NFATc1 vectors were generously provided by Dr. Neil A. Clipstone (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). The pBJ5-NFATc2 (pSH210) and pBJ5-NFATc3 (pSH250A) vectors were kind gifts from Dr. Gerald R. Crabtree (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). Sequences of all DNA constructs were confirmed by automated sequence analyses. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, cells (2 × 106) were treated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies for 16 h, cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, harvested, and lysed in SDS buffer. DNA was sheared by ultrasonication using a high intensity ultrasonic processor (Heat Systems) for 8 × 12-s pulses at 30% amplitude. Lysates were centrifuged, resuspended in ChIP dilution buffer, and precleared using salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose. Protein-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated with 6 μg of anti-NFATc2 or isotype-matched control Ab (mouse IgG2a) overnight at 4 °C. Ab-protein-DNA complexes were then captured using salmon sperm DNA-protein A-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing beads with low and high salt LiCl and TE buffers, the protein-DNA complexes were eluted using 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3 buffer and disrupted by heating at 65 °C for 4 h. DNA was then phenol/chloroform-extracted and ethanol-precipitated and subjected to PCR using primers spanning –288 to transcription start site (TSS) of the icos promoter: sense, 5′-CCG CTC GAG CAT GCA TGC ATC CAT C-3′; antisense, 5′-CCC AAG CTT AGT GCT CAA AAG TGT CAG-3′ (94 °C, 15 s; 60 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 1 min, 28 cycles). PCR products were then separated on 2% agarose gels. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared using the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents kit (Pierce). Briefly, cells (10 × 106) were untreated or stimulated for 16 h and washed in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. Nuclear extracts were prepared by hypotonic lysis and high salt extraction and subsequently cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C before being concentrated with a Microcon-3 column (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). Nuclear extracts were stored at –80 °C prior to use, and protein content was measured using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). For gel shift assays, double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Labeled probes were purified using Probe-Quant G-50 microcolumns (Amersham Biosciences). Binding reactions were conducted at room temperature for 20 min in a 20-μl total volume containing 0.5 ng of labeled probe, 5 μg of nuclear extract, 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) (Amersham Biosciences), and gel shift buffer (12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 12.5% glycerol). For competition assays, competing oligonucleotides were preincubated with the reaction mix at room temperature for 15 min before the addition of radiolabeled probe. Binding reactions were size-fractionated using a 5% nondenaturing PAGE in 0.5× TBE and electrophoresed at 120 V for 4 h at room temperature. The gel was subsequently transferred onto 3MM chromatography paper, dried, and exposed to autoradiographic film for 1 to 3 days at –80 °C. The probe sequences were as follows: p154_105, 5′-TCA CCG GGT ACT TGC CAT GCA GGA GGC GCT GTG ATA GCT CTC CAA GTA GA-3′; p154_130, 5′-TCA CCG GGT ACT TGC CAT GCA GGA G-3′. Competitor sequences were p154_105, as above; p154_130, as above; p129_105, 5′-GCG CTG TGA TAG CTC TCC AAG TAG A-3′; p154_130_mut, 5′-TCA CCG GGT AAG A 4The underlined sequences denote the mutant binding site for ERK-sensitive TF(s).

ICOS Induction by TCR and CD28 Co-engagement Is Subject to Transcriptional Control—ICOS expression is induced upon T cell activation and, in particular, in response to TCR and CD28 co-engagement (29McAdam A.J. Chang T.T. Lumelsky A.E. Greenfield E.A. Boussiotis V.A. Duke-Cohan J.S. Chernova T. Malenkovich N. Jabs C. Kuchroo V.K. Ling V. Collins M. Sharpe A.H. Freeman G.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5035-5040Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). To examine in detail the kinetics of ICOS induction, we first determined the level of ICOS cell surface expression and correlated that with the induction of ICOS mRNA in murine primary CD4+ T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, which engaged the TCR and CD28, respectively (henceforth designated as TCR/CD28). As shown in Fig. 1A, an increase in cell surface expression of ICOS could be detected as early as at6hofT cell activation using a fluorochrome-conjugated anti-ICOS antibody in flow cytometry analysis, and the expression level seems to peak at 40 h of T cell stimulation. At the transcriptional level, an increase in ICOS mRNA could be detected via real time RT-PCR as early as 3 h after TCR/CD28 stimulation, and the mRNA level appeared to peak and plateau from 6 to 18 h before declining (Fig. 1B). Thus, it was evident from the temporal increase in mRNA and cell surface protein expression that ICOS was subjected to some level of transcriptional control. ICOS Expression Is Regulated by Distinct Pathways Downstream of TCR and CD28 Signaling—Since TCR/CD28 stimulation could lead to an increase in ICOS mRNA and cell surface protein expression, we were interested to characterize the signaling pathways that regulate ICOS induction. To accomplish this, we first utilized a range of chemical inhibitors to block intracellular signaling pathways known to be activated by TCR/CD28 engagement in primary CD4+ T cells and assessed their effects on cell surface ICOS induction (Fig. 2A). Our data show that FK506 (tacrolimus), which is known to inhibit calcineurin, substantially diminished cell surface expression of ICOS on activated T cells, thus suggesting a possible role for this pathway in ICOS induction. This was consistent with a previous study that showed an inhibitory effect of CsA, which also deactivates calcineurin, on ICOS induction in human CD4+ T cells (9Beier K.C. Hutloff A. Dittrich A.M. Heuck C. Rauch A. Buchner K. Ludewig B. Ochs H.D. Mages H.W. Kroczek R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 3707-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Furthermore, since calcineurin is Ca2+-sensitive, blocking Ca2+ elevation in general (e.g. with EGTA) also mitigated the induction of ICOS (data not shown). To determine whether the reduction in cell surface expression of ICOS on activated T cells by FK506 treatment was in part a consequence of transcriptional reduction, we assayed for the amount of ICOS mRNA in FK506- and CsA-treated TCR/CD28-stimulated CD4+ T cells. Indeed, as seen in Fig. 2B, pretreatment of these activated cells with FK506 and CsA both reduced the amount of ICOS mRNA up-regulation compared with untreated cells, indicating that this signaling pathway probably acts at the level of ICOS transcription. In addition, we show that PP2 but not piceatannol also attenuated TCR/CD28-induced ICOS induction, hence impl"
https://openalex.org/W2052077670,"In fission yeast, the replication checkpoint is enforced by the kinase Cds1 (human Chk2), which regulates both cell cycle progression and DNA repair factors to ensure that the genome is faithfully duplicated prior to mitosis. Cds1 contains a forkhead-associated domain that mediates its interaction with phosphorylated residues in target proteins. One target of Cds1 is the essential nuclear protein Rad60, which contains the unique structural feature of tandem SUMO homology domains at its C terminus. Hypomorphic mutants of Rad60 cause profound defects in DNA repair and replication stress tolerance. To explore the physiological significance of the Cds1-Rad60 interaction, we have examined the phosphorylation of Rad60 by Cds1 in vitro and the in vivo phosphorylation of Rad60 in response to replication blocks. We find that the N terminus but not the SUMO-like domain of Rad60 is phosphorylated in both conditions. Three important Rad60 phosphorylation sites were identified: Thr72, Ser32, and Ser34. Rad60 Thr72 mediates the Cds1-Rad60 interaction and is required for the Cds1-dependent phosphorylation of Rad60 in response to replication arrest. Phosphorylation of Rad60 Ser32 and Ser34 in a putative SUMO-binding motif is critical for the survival of replication stress. In addition, mutation of Rad60 Ser32 and Ser34 to alanine is lethal in cells deleted for the RecQ DNA helicase Rqh1. Finally, we find that Rad60 self-associates via its C-terminal SUMO-like domain and putative SUMO-binding motifs.

Genome integrity is threatened by multiple sources of damage throughout the cell cycle. A major problem cells have to cope with is perturbations from endogenous or exogenous sources that negatively affect replication fork progression during S phase (1Branzei D. Foiani M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To mitigate DNA damage associated with such perturbations, the replication checkpoint is activated and regulates multiple factors involved in replication, repair, and transcription (1Branzei D. Foiani M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). One such factor is the homologous recombination repair protein Rad60, which is regulated via direct interaction with the replication checkpoint kinase Cds1 (2Boddy M.N. Shanahan P. McDonald W.H. Lopez-Girona A. Noguchi E. Yates I.J. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 3Morishita T. Tsutsui Y. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 3537-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When replication is blocked, Rad60 undergoes Cds1-dependent phosphorylation and delocalization from its normal nuclear localization (2Boddy M.N. Shanahan P. McDonald W.H. Lopez-Girona A. Noguchi E. Yates I.J. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A Rad60 mutant, Rad60-4, which is apparently refractory to regulation by the replication checkpoint, causes cellular hypersensitivity to inhibition of DNA replication (2Boddy M.N. Shanahan P. McDonald W.H. Lopez-Girona A. Noguchi E. Yates I.J. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Such regulation of a recombination repair factor is reminiscent of the Cds1-dependent regulation of the structure-specific endonuclease Mus81-Eme1 (4Boddy M.N. Lopez-Girona A. Shanahan P. Interthal H. Heyer W.D. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 8758-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 5Kai M. Boddy M.N. Russell P. Wang T.S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Uncoupling the interaction between Cds1 and Mus81-Eme1 results in the unscheduled presence of Mus81-Eme1 on chromatin during replication arrest and the subsequent initiation of recombinogenic processes (5Kai M. Boddy M.N. Russell P. Wang T.S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Apparent negative regulation of recombination repair proteins by the replication checkpoint is consistent with the failure to observe recombination repair foci in wild-type fission yeast during hydroxyurea-induced replication arrest (6Meister P. Taddei A. Vernis L. Poidevin M. Gasser S.M. Baldacci G. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Notably, recombination repair foci are observed following release from replication arrest and entry into G2 phase or during the arrest if Cds1 is deleted (6Meister P. Taddei A. Vernis L. Poidevin M. Gasser S.M. Baldacci G. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Rad60 is the founding member of a family of eukaryotic proteins that have a unique structural organization. Rad60 contains a SUMO homology domain at its C terminus and a largely unstructured N terminus enriched in acidic residues (2Boddy M.N. Shanahan P. McDonald W.H. Lopez-Girona A. Noguchi E. Yates I.J. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Despite very low sequence conservation, structural and perhaps functional homologues (supported by shared genetic interactions) were identified in budding yeast and mammalian cells, called Esc2p and Nip45, respectively (2Boddy M.N. Shanahan P. McDonald W.H. Lopez-Girona A. Noguchi E. Yates I.J. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This family was recently rediscovered and named RENi (after Rad60, Esc2p, and Nip45) in a bioinformatics-based approach (7Novatchkova M. Bachmair A. Eisenhaber B. Eisenhaber F. BMC Bioinformatics. 2005; 6: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Proteins containing ubiquitin-like domains have been extensively studied and, despite functional diversity, appear to have the unifying theme of interaction with the proteasome, a property of ubiquitin itself (8Hartmann-Petersen R. Gordon C. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 9Upadhya S.C. Hegde A.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 280-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It seems possible then that Rad60 and its homologues will possess intrinsic SUMO-like properties. Whereas it is clear that there is a functional connection between the replication checkpoint kinase Cds1 and Rad60, the physiological impact of this interaction has not been explored with well defined separation of function mutants. In this study, we show that Rad60 is a substrate for Cds1 both in vivo and in vitro. We identify key Rad60 phosphorylation sites that are important for the Cds1-Rad60 interaction and for the survival of replication stress. Finally, it appears that Rad60 self-associates in vivo in a manner dependent on the C-terminal SUMO-like domains and putative SUMO-binding motifs. Ectopic expression of the Rad60 SUMO-like domains results in hypersensitivity to replication stress and is lethal in cells lacking the RecQ helicase, Rqh1. These dominant negative phenotypes require the putative SUMO-binding motifs of Rad60. General Techniques—Standard fission yeast methods and media were used as described in Ref. 10Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar. Hydroxyurea (HU) 4The abbreviations used are: HU, hydroxyurea; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; SBM, SUMO-binding motif. sensitivity assays were performed as described previously (2Boddy M.N.

Interthal H. Heyer W.D. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 8758-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The specified Rad60 mutations were generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene according to the manufacturer's protocols. Immunoblotting and Pulldown Assays—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously with extracts from cells lysed with glass beads by vortexing (2Boddy M.N. Shanahan P. McDonald W.H. Lopez-Girona A. Noguchi E. Yates I.J. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 4Boddy M.N. Lopez-Girona A. Shanahan P. Interthal H. Heyer W.D. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 8758-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon membrane, blocked in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline and 0.3% Tween 20, and probed with specific antibodies. Myc epitope was detected with 9E10 anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (1:5,000 dilution; Covance). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) precipitations were performed as described previously (11Shiozaki K. Russell P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 506-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For GST pulldown experiments, GST fusion protein expression was induced from the nmt1 promoter for 18 h prior to harvesting (12Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in buffer A, and glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the lysates followed by incubation at 4 °C for 2 h with rotation. Complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with buffer A before resuspension in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. For HA immunoprecipitations, cell lysates were incubated with anti-HA antibody (polyclonal HA.11; Covance), coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads (CL4B; Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h in lysis buffer A and then washed three times. In Vitro Kinase Assay—For in vitro phosphorylation assays, bacterially expressed GST fusion fragments of Rad60 protein were purified by GST pulldown followed by elution with 20 mm glutathione, and Cds1-HA kinase was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads. Appropriate amounts of kinase and substrate were incubated in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0, 1 mm ATP, [γ-32P]ATP (2.5 μCi), for 30 min at 30 °C. Samples were then resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After Coomassie staining, the gels were dried and exposed to film. Purification of Rad60-TAP and Phosphorylation Analysis—Briefly, cells (∼40 g, wet weight) expressing Rad60-TAP at the genomic locus (treated or not with HU for 4 h) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and lysed with a motorized mortar and pestle (Retsch) in buffer A. Rad60-TAP was purified from clarified lysates as described previously (2Boddy M.N. Shanahan P. McDonald W.H. Lopez-Girona A. Noguchi E. Yates I.J. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The final eluate was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (25% (v/v)) for 1 h on ice. The precipitate was pelleted in a bench top microcentrifuge (Eppendorf) at a relative centrifugal force of 16. The pellet was washed twice with acetone (–20 °C) and air-dried. The sample was reduced and alkylated with dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide and then sequentially digested with endonuclease Lys-C (Roche Applied Science) and trypsin (Perceptive Biosystems) (13McCormack A.L. Schieltz D.M. Goode B. Yang S. Barnes G. Drubin D. Yates III, J.R. Anal. Chem. 1997; 69: 767-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). For the in vitro phosphorylation reactions, GST-Rad60 fragments were incubated with Cds1-HA kinase as described above in reaction buffer containing 1 mm cold ATP for 30 min. The supernatants were then processed as described above. Identification of phosphorylation sites was performed as previously described (14MacCoss M.J. McDonald W.H. Saraf A. Sadygov R. Clark J.M. Tasto J.J. Gould K.L. Wolters D. Washburn M. Weiss A. Clark J.I. Yates III, J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7900-7905Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Strains—The following strains were used in this study (all ura4-D18 leu1–32, unless otherwise specified): NB203.2 (rad60:13myc:kanMx6), NB303B (rad60T72A:13myc:kanMx6), NB303C (rad60-4:13myc:kanMx6), NB206A (rad60:13myc: kanMx6 +pRepKZ-Cds1 (1–190)), NB207A (rad60:13myc: kanMx6 +pRepKZ-Cds1[1–190′VANFA′]), NB328I (rad60T72A: 13myc:kanMx6 +pRepKZ-Cds1 (1–190)), NB274A (rad60: 13myc:kanMx6, nmt1:GST-Cds1:leu1+), NB275A (rad60: 13myc:kanMx6 nmt1:GST-Cds1′VANFA′:leu1+), GR756 (rad60T72A:13myc:kanMx6, nmt1:GST-Cds1:leu1+), GR1093 (rad60IQK:13CCC:kanMx6), GR1097 (rad60S32A/S34A: 13myc:kanMx6), GR1099; GR1100 (rad60S32A/S34A:13myc: kanMx6), GR1098 (rad60S32A/S34A:13myc:kanMx6, nmt1: GST-Cds1:leu1+), NB35 (Cds1:2HA6HIS:ura4+), NB82 (Cds1-KD:2HA6HIS:ura4+), GR1063 (rad60:13myc:kanMx6 +pRepKZ-Rad60 (1–406)), GR1064 (rad60:13myc:kanMx6 +pRepKZ-Rad60 (1–118)), GR1067 (rad60:13myc:kanMx6 +pRepKZ-Rad60 (1–325)), GR1066 (rad60:13myc:kanMx6 +pRepKZ-Rad60 (119–406)), GR1068 (rad60:13myc:kanMx6 +pRepKZ-Rad60 (188–406)), GR1069 (rad60:13myc:kanMx6 +pRepKZ-Rad60 (188–278)), GR1072 (rad60:13myc:kanMx6 +pRepKZ-Rad60 (188–230)), GR1073 (rad60:13myc:kanMx6 +pRepKZ-Rad60 (224–325)), GR1074 (rad60:13myc:kanMx6 +pRepKZ-Rad60 (278–406)), GR1078 (rad60:13myc:kanMx6 +pRepKZ-Rad60[188–400′I214K/V217K/V268K/V269K′]), NB3158 (rad60:13myc:kanMx6 cds1::ura4+), NB3159 (rad60:TAP: kanMx6), NB3167 (rqh1::ura4+). Rad60 Is Phosphorylated on Multiple N-terminal Serine/Threonine Residues—Rad60 becomes hyperphosphorylated in response to replication stress induced by HU treatment (2Boddy M.N. Shanahan P. McDonald W.H. Lopez-Girona A. Noguchi E. Yates I.J. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This hyperphosphorylation is dependent on the replication checkpoint kinase Cds1, with which Rad60 physically interacts (2Boddy M.N. Shanahan P. McDonald W.H. Lopez-Girona A. Noguchi E. Yates I.J. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cells expressing temperature-sensitive alleles of rad60, rad60-1 (K263E) and rad60-3 (F272V), display increased sensitivity to HU, UV, and methylmethane sulfonate at the permissive temperature (2Boddy M.N. Shanahan P. McDonald W.H. Lopez-Girona A. Noguchi E. Yates I.J. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 3Morishita T. Tsutsui Y. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 3537-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The protein encoded by another hypomorphic allele of rad60, rad60-4 (T72A/I232S/Q250R/K312N) fails to interact with Cds1 and does not undergo the typical Cds1-dependent phosphorylation when replication is blocked (2Boddy M.N. Shanahan P. McDonald W.H. Lopez-Girona A. Noguchi E. Yates I.J. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). rad60-4-expressing cells are highly sensitive to HU but only moderately sensitive to UV and do not display any vegetative growth defects (2Boddy M.N. Shanahan P. McDonald W.H. Lopez-Girona A. Noguchi E. Yates I.J. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Despite the above correlative observations, the role of the Rad60-Cds1 interaction and resultant Rad60 hyperphosphorylation in the survival of replication stress remains unclear. We have used two different approaches to determine the profile of Rad60 phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo. To test whether Cds1 is capable of directly phosphorylating Rad60, we performed an in vitro kinase assay. Full-length Rad60 or fragments of the protein were expressed as GST fusion proteins in bacteria. Purified GST-Rad60 fragments were used as substrates for either wild-type or kinase-dead HA-Cds1, which was immunopurified from cells pretreated with HU. Wild-type HU-activated Cds1 phosphorylates both full-length Rad60 and two N-terminal fragments containing residues 1–118 and 119–230 respectively, whereas no comparable phosphorylation signal was detected for a carboxyl-terminal fragment, including residues 224–406 (Fig. 1, A and B). Mass spectrometry analysis was then applied to identify which Rad60 residues were phosphorylated by Cds1 in vitro. In parallel, we affinity-purified Rad60-TAP from cells treated or not with HU and subjected the purified protein to mass spectrometry analysis to identify phosphorylated residues. The results of the mass spectrometry analyses confirmed that Cds1 was able to phosphorylate Rad60 on multiple N-terminal serine and threonine residues in vitro. The data also indicated that Rad60 was hyperphosphorylated in vivo at multiple sites concentrated in the N terminus of the protein. Highly confident identification of particular phosphorylation sites was not possible due to the density of phosphorylated residues across the N terminus of Rad60. However, among the predicted sites were Thr72, Ser32, and Ser34. Interestingly, Thr72 was one of the sites mutated in Rad60-4, which is refractory to Cds1-dependent regulation (2Boddy M.N. Shanahan P. McDonald W.H. Lopez-Girona A. Noguchi E. Yates I.J. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and Ser32 and Ser34 are located within a motif that is found in proteins associated with SUMO modification pathways (see below). We therefore studied the effects of mutations at these positions on Rad60 function in vivo. Thr(P)72 Mediates the Interaction between Rad60 and Cds1—Cds1 contains an FHA domain, which is a well characterized phosphopeptide binding motif (15Durocher D. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 387-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Cds1 binds and phosphorylates the Mus81 component of the heterodimeric DNA repair endonuclease Mus81-Eme1, regulating its activity and thereby minimizing genomic lesions (4Boddy M.N. Lopez-Girona A. Shanahan P. Interthal H. Heyer W.D. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 8758-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 5Kai M. Boddy M.N. Russell P. Wang T.S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The Cds1-Mus81 interaction is mediated via Thr(P)239 in Mus81, which conforms to the pTXXD motif (where pT represents phosphothreonine) obtained in an in vitro phosphopeptide enrichment screen using the Cds1 FHA domain (16Durocher D. Taylor I.A. Sarbassova D. Haire L.F. Westcott S.L. Jackson S.P. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1169-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Wild-type but not an FHA mutant of the Cds1 N terminus (1–190 amino acids) interacts robustly with Rad60 (Fig. 2A) (2Boddy M.N. Shanahan P. McDonald W.H. Lopez-Girona A. Noguchi E. Yates I.J. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). No significant interaction was detected between Rad60 and the FHA domain of another protein, Dma1 (Fig. 2A). This underscores the specificity of the interaction between Cds1 and Rad60. Notably, despite an excess of hypophosphorylated Rad60, the Cds1 FHA domain bound specifically to the hyperphosphorylated population of Rad60 (Fig. 2A). To test the role of Rad60 Thr(P)72 in the Cds1-Rad60 interaction, we replaced the genomic copy of rad60+ with a rad60.T72A mutant allele. Full-length Cds1, wild type or FHA mutant, was expressed in either a wild-type or T72A Rad60-Myc background. Following purification of GST-Cds1, co-precipitating Rad60-Myc was detected by anti-Myc immunoblotting. Rad60-Myc co-precipitated with wild-type GST-Cds1 but not an FHA mutant (VANFA; Fig. 2B) (2Boddy M.N. Shanahan P. McDonald W.H. Lopez-Girona A. Noguchi E. Yates I.J. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the interaction between full-length Cds1 and Rad60.T72A-Myc was abolished (Fig. 2B). Rad60.T72A disrupted the interaction between Rad60 and Cds1 to the same extent as mutations in the FHA domain of Cds1, confirming that the interaction of Rad60 with Cds1 is mediated by FHA-dependent recognition of Thr(P)72 (Fig. 2B). Rad60 Thr72 is within the motif T72ILD and is thus similar to the Mus81 Thr239 site T239DID, conforming to the previous finding that an aspartic acid at the +3-position is crucial for Cds1 FHA binding (16Durocher D. Taylor I.A. Sarbassova D. Haire L.F. Westcott S.L. Jackson S.P. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1169-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Having identified the interaction site between Cds1 and Rad60, we wished to test the in vivo effects of the rad60.T72A mutation. Initially, we studied the Cds1-dependent phosphorylation of Rad60 via changes in its electrophoretic mobility. Wild-type Rad60 is phosphorylated in a Cds1-dependent manner when replication is blocked by HU (Fig. 3A) (2Boddy M.N. Shanahan P. McDonald W.H. Lopez-Girona A. Noguchi E. Yates I.J. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Notably, most of the HU-induced phosphorylation observed for wild-type Rad60 was abolished by the T72A mutation (Fig. 3A). The residual phosphorylation of Rad60.T72A was similar to that observed for the Rad60-4 mutant or to that seen in the Cds1 delete background (Fig. 3A). To highlight the defect in phosphorylation of Rad60.T72A compared with wild-type Rad60 under conditions of replicative stress, we further resolved the Rad60 phosphorylated species on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 3B). In keeping with the complexity of Rad60 phosphorylation, at least four distinct Rad60 species can be detected. It is clear that compared with wild-type, Rad60.T72A is defective in HU-induced hyperphosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Given the similar defects in Cds1-dependent phosphorylation, we then compared the HU sensitivity of cells carrying the rad60.T72A or rad60-4 mutations. Surprisingly, rad60.T72A cells exhibited HU sensitivity that was comparable with that of wild type, whereas rad60-4 cells were hypersensitive (Fig. 3B). This result suggests that it is the remaining mutations in Rad60-4 (I232S, Q250R, and K312N) that cause hypersensitivity to HU. We therefore generated a Rad60 mutant that contained only the I232S, Q250R, and K312N mutations (rad60.IQK). As predicted, the rad60.IQK cells behaved like rad60-4 cells in terms of HU survival (Fig. 3B). That rad60.T72A cells show no overt sensitivity to inhibition of replication is reminiscent of the results obtained with mus81.T239A cells and suggests a similarly subtle regulatory role for the Cds1-Rad60 interaction (see “Discussion”) (5Kai M. Boddy M.N. Russell P. Wang T.S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of a Putative SUMO-binding Motif in Rad60 and Survival of Replicative Stress—Residues Ser32 and Ser34 are part of a putative noncovalent SUMO-binding motif, hhXSX(S/T)aaaa (in which h represents a hydrophobic amino acid and a is an acidic amino acid) (17Minty A. Dumont X. Kaghad M. Caput D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36316-36323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). This motif was found to bind SUMO-1 robustly, and mutations affecting the serine or other positions strongly reduced binding (17Minty A. Dumont X. Kaghad M. Caput D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36316-36323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). This motif is found in various proteins known to be involved in the SUMO-1 pathway, acting as either modifiers or substrates (e.g. PIASx and PML) (17Minty A. Dumont X. Kaghad M. Caput D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36316-36323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Given that there is evidence for in vivo phosphorylation of Ser32 and Ser34, we tested their importance in Rad60 function. Cells expressing Rad60 with serine to alanine substitutions at positions 32 and 34 (S32A/S34A) do not display any growth defects or temperature sensitivity (Fig. 4A). However, they exhibit hypersensitivity to replication blockage by HU, to a level that is comparable with rad60-4 cells (Fig. 4A). This result suggests that phosphorylation of Ser32 and Ser34 in Rad60 plays a critical role in the cellular response to replication stress. To further support this hypothesis, we generated a strain in which Rad60 Ser32 and Ser34 were replaced with glutamate residues (rad60.S32E/S34E) to simulate phosphorylation of these sites. The rad60.S32E/S34E mutant cells did not display any growth defects and were similar to wild type in their response to replication blockage (Fig. 4A). We also analyzed the phosphorylation status of Rad60.S32A/S34A following HU treatment. Rad60.S32A/S34A shows relatively inefficient HU-induced hyperphosphorylation as compared with wild-type Rad60 (Figs. 3B and 4B). To rule out the possibility that the defects associated with Rad60.S32A/S34A are related to impaired interaction with Cds1, we tested the ability of Rad60.S32A/S34A to associate with overexpressed GST-Cds1 (Fig. 4C). The interaction between Rad60.S32A/S34A and Cds1 appeared to be as robust as that with wild-type Rad60 (Fig. 4C). However, there is a notable reduction in the hyperphosphorylated form of Rad60.S32A/S34A, as compared with the stoichiometric phosphorylation of wild-type Rad60. This observation parallels the inefficient HU-induced phosphorylation observed for Rad60.S32A/S34A (Figs. 3B and 4B). It is known that wild-type Rad60 function is required for the viability of cells deleted for Rqh1 or the Mus81-Eme1 endonuclease (2Boddy M.N. Shanahan P. McDonald W.H. Lopez-Girona A. Noguchi E. Yates I.J. Russell P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Both Rqh1 and Mus81-Eme1 play critical roles in mitigating genomic instability associated with the stalling of replication forks (5Kai M. Boddy M.N. Russell P. Wang T.S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 18Ahn J.S. Osman F. Whitby M.C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2011-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 19Kai M. Wang T.S. Mutat. Res. 2003; 532: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of abolishing Rad60 Ser32/Ser34 phosphorylation on the viability of Rqh1 and Mus81-Eme1 mutants, we constructed double mutants of rad60.S32A/S34A with rqh1Δ or eme1Δ using random spore analysis. Double mutants could be isolated but were extremely sick, much sicker than either single mutant, and in the case of rad60.S32A/S34A rqh1Δ, continued propagation of the strain was not possible. One interpretation of these observations is that rad60.S32A/S34A cells are defective in normal DNA replication and accumulate DNA structures that require the action of Rqh1 or Mus81-Eme1. Rad60 Forms a Homodimer via Its C-terminal SUMO Domains—We have shown that residues within a putative SUMO-binding motif hhXSX(S/T)aaaa at the N terminus of Rad60 are critical for its role in tolerance of HU-induced replication arrest. Three structurally distinct SUMO interaction motifs have been identified and shown to interact with SUMO by two-hybrid analysis or other similarly sensitive detection methods (17Minty A. Dumont X.

Further analysis of the Rad60 primary sequence revealed the presence of hydrophobic regions matching the consensus sequences (V/I)X(V/I)(V/I) or (V/I)(V/I)X(V/I/L). These sequences match a motif that is found in proteins involved in SUMO metabolism and in those that bind SUMO-1-conjugated proteins (22Song J. Durrin L.K. Wilkinson T.A. Krontiris T.G. Chen Y.

In DEL-TnT rats, myofibrillar Ca2+-dependent tension development as well as Ca2+ sensitivity of tension were significantly decreased, whereas tension-dependent ATP consumption (“tension cost”) was markedly increased.

Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) 3The abbreviations used are: FHC, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; TnT, troponin T; NT, nontransgenic; FOC, force of contraction; cTnT, cardiac troponin T; Ap5A, P1,P5-di(adenosine 5′)-pentaphosphate; hTnT, human TnT. 3The abbreviations used are: FHC, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; TnT, troponin T; NT, nontransgenic; FOC, force of contraction; cTnT, cardiac troponin T; Ap5A, P1,P5-di(adenosine 5′)-pentaphosphate; hTnT, human TnT. is an autosomal-dominant inherited disease characterized by ventricular hypertrophy, arrhythmias, and sudden death. The phenotype of affected individuals may vary from early sudden death, marked hypertrophy with contractile dysfunction, to an asymptomatic carrier status (reviewed in Refs. 1Maron B.J. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2002; 287: 1308-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 2Franz W.M. Muller O.J. Katus H.A.

Genet. 2002; 11: 2499-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In the past 10 years, several genes could be linked to FHC, almost uniformly encoding contractile proteins such as β-myosin heavy chain and cardiac troponin T (4Marian A.J. Roberts R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 655-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). FHC has thus been labeled a “disease of the sarcomere” (5Thierfelder L. Watkins H. MacRae C. Lamas R. McKenna W. Vosberg H.P. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 701-712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Mutations of the cardiac troponin T (cTnT) gene are of particular interest because they are associated with a high incidence of arrhythmias and sudden death even in the absence of significant myocardial hypertrophy (6Moolman J.C. Corfield V.A. Posen B. Ngumbela K. Seidman C.E. Brink P. Watkins H. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Yet the pathogenesis of FHC is still poorly understood, and there is no clear understanding how these mutations lead to the development of FHC with diastolic dysfunction and sudden cardiac death. Biochemical and biophysical analyses have failed to identify a common mechanism underlying the alterations of cardiac contractility resulting from these mutations. For example, missense mutations in β-myosin heavy chain have been shown to both depress (7Cuda G. Fananapazir L. Epstein N.D. Sellers J.R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) as well as enhance (8Tyska M.J. Hayes E. Giewat M. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Warshaw D.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) contractile function, whereas mutations in α-tropomyosin increase calcium sensitivity and force development of the sarcomere (9Bottinelli R. Coviello D.A. Redwood C.S. Pellegrino M.A. Maron B.J. Spirito P. Watkins H. Reggiani C. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 106-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Likewise, it is still unclear how FHC-associated cTnT mutations trigger the initiation of FHC (10Gomes A.V. Barnes J.A. Harada K. Potter J.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 263: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The exact molecular function of troponin T is also still a matter of debate; however, it is believed that cTnT stabilizes the troponin complex, consisting of troponin T, I, and C. In addition, cTnT may affect and potentially regulate the Ca2+ sensitivity of myofibrillar ATPase activity, the level of ATPase activation, and/or force development (11Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 575-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 12Malnic B. Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. J. Biol.

Recently, it has been observed that FHC patients with cardiac troponin T, β-myosin heavy chain, and myosin-binding protein C mutations display a markedly altered phosphocreatine to ATP ratio, irrespective of the presence of myocardial hypertrophy (16Crilley J.G. Boehm E.A. Blair E. Rajagopalan B. Blamire A.M. Styles P. McKenna W.J. Ostman-Smith I. Clarke K. Watkins H. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2003; 41: 1776-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). This finding led to the new hypothesis of myocardial energy depletion being a critical factor in the pathogenesis of FHC (17Ashrafian H. Redwood C. Blair E. Watkins H. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 263-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). To get a closer understanding of the pathophysiology underlying FHC, we have previously (18Frey N. Franz W.M. Gloeckner K. Degenhardt M. Muller M. Muller O. Merz H. Katus H.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 47: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) generated a transgenic rat model of the disease by overexpressing a C-terminal cTnT truncation (DEL-TnT), resulting from an intron 15 splice donor site mutation observed in FHC patients. Wild-type rats and rats overexpressing nonmutated human TnT served as controls. In a working heart model, DEL-TnT-transgenic rats exhibited significant systolic and diastolic dysfunction in the absence of cardiac hypertrophy. Of note, relatively small amounts of DEL-TnT (≈5% of endogenous TnT) were sufficient to induce this phenotype, similar to observations in other transgenic models of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (19Oberst L. Zhao G. Park J.T. Brugada R. Michael L.H. Entman M.L. Roberts R. Marian A.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 1498-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20Tardiff J.C. Factor S.M. Tompkins B.D. Hewett T.E. Palmer B.M. Moore R.L. Schwartz S. Robbins J. Leinwand L.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2800-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In contrast, transgenic rats overexpressing a nonmutated human TnT molecule (≈30% of endogenous TnT) displayed improved contractile performance. Moreover, after exercise training, myocardial disarray and ventricular arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, were observed in DEL-TnT-transgenic rats (18Frey N. Franz W.M. Gloeckner K. Degenhardt M. Muller M. Muller O. Merz H. Katus H.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 47: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence analyses of transgenic cardiomyocytes demonstrated that the mutant TnT is incorporated into the sarcomere, suggesting a dominant-negative mode of action rather than haploinsufficiency. To further investigate the mechanisms underlying contractile dysfunction in DEL-TnT transgenic rats and specifically whether alterations of Ca2+ homeostasis contribute to the phenotype, we now performed simultaneous measurements of force and intracellular Ca2+ transients in isolated electrically stimulated papillary muscle strips. Furthermore, to test whether ATP utilization might be impaired in DEL-TnT transgenic rats, calcium-dependent tension development and myofibrillar ATPase activity were measured in Triton X-100 skinned cardiac fiber preparations. Rats overexpressing the normal, i.e. nontruncated, human TnT molecule as well as nontransgenic controls were studied for comparison. The current findings confirm and extend our previous data that a C-terminal truncation of the cardiac TnT molecule impairs the force-generating capacity of the cycling cross-bridges. Moreover, this effect is accompanied by increased tension-dependent ATP utilization in DEL-TnT rats, thus supporting the hypothesis of energy compromise as a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of FHC. Animals—Transgenic rats overexpressing the predominant adult isoform of human cTnT (288 amino acids) were generated as described previously (18Frey N. Franz W.M. Gloeckner K. Degenhardt M. Muller M. Muller O. Merz H. Katus H.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 47: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cardiac skinned fiber preparations as well as right ventricular papillary muscles were investigated from transgenic rats overexpressing human wild-type cTnT (TnT-rats, n = 10) or a truncated human cTnT molecule resulting from an intron 15 splice donor site mutation, lacking the most C-terminal 14 amino acids (DEL-TnT rats, n = 10), in comparison to nontransgenic controls (NT, Sprague-Dawley rats, n = 10). The age of the rats ranged from 14 to 16 months. The animals were killed by cervical dislocation, and hearts were rapidly removed. Control and transgenic animals did not differ in their body weight (NT, 414 ± 42 g; DEL-TnT, 427 ± 33 g; hTnT, 415 ± 22 g) or their heart wet weight (NT, 1.6 ± 0.1 g; DEL-TnT, 1.9 ± 0.1 g; hTnT, 1.9 ± 0.1 g). The investigation conformed with institutional guidelines as well as the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication Number 85-23, revised 1996). Simultaneous Measurements of Force and Intracellular Ca2+ Transients—The intracellular Ca2+ transient was measured at room temperature in isolated, electrically driven right ventricular papillary muscles by the fluorescence indicator fura-2 (21Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To facilitate cell loading fura-2 was used as acetoxymethyl (AM) ester. These AM esters passively cross the plasma membrane and, once inside the cell, are cleaved to cell-impermeant products by intracellular esterases. After an initial control measurement of the force of contraction (FOC), the muscle strips were incubated for 4 h in darkness to avoid photobleaching of the dye in an oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) Ringer's solution containing 5 μmol/liter of fura 2-AM. The external calcium concentration was 1.8 mmol/liter. The experimental setup was purchased from Scientific Instruments, Heidelberg, Germany, and has been described previously (22Brixius K. Pietsch M. Hoischen S. Muller-Ehmsen J. Schwinger R.H.G. J. Appl. Physiol. 1997; 83: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because the right papillary muscles are more suitable for fura-2 measurements because of their smaller diameter, Ca2+ transients were studied in these preparations. The cross-sectional areas of papillary muscle preparations were comparable in all experimental groups as follows: NT rats, 0.58 ± 0.05 mm2; TnT rats, 0.45 ± 0.03 mm2; DEL-TnT rats, 0.58 ± 0.06 mm2. Left ventricular myocardium was used for skinned fiber experiments (see below). Preparation of Triton X-100 Skinned Fibers—Skinning of the heart muscle fibers was performed as described previously (23Zobel C. Brixius K. Pietsch M. Munch G. Bolck B. Schwinger R.H.G. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fiber bundles (diameter <0.2 mm) were dissected from left ventricular papillary muscles and permeabilized at 4 °C for 20 h in a solution containing 50% (v/v) glycerol, 1% Triton X, and in mmol/liter NaN3 10, ATP 5, MgCl2 5, EGTA 4, 1,4-dithioerythritol 2, and imidazole 20 (pH 7.0). Subsequently, the fibers were stored in the same buffer without Triton X-100 at –20 °C. The experiments were performed within 5 days. Force and ATPase Activity Measurements—Triton X-100 skinned fiber bundles were prepared under the microscope and then mounted isometrically and connected to a force transducer (Scientific Instruments, Heidelberg, Germany). Mean sarcomere length was 1.9 ± 0.03 μm. ATPase activity was simultaneously measured with tension development using a linked NADH fluorescence assay (0.6 mm NADH, 140 units of lactate dehydrogenase) as described previously (23Zobel C. Brixius K. Pietsch M. Munch G. Bolck B. Schwinger R.H.G. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 24Brixius K. Mehlhorn U. Bloch W. Schwinger R.H.G. J. Pharmacol.

Relaxation solution contained 20 mm imidazole, 10 mm ATP, 5 mm NaN3, 5 mm EGTA, 12.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm Ap5A. The contraction solution contained calcium EGTA (5 mm) instead of EGTA. The ATP concentration was stabilized with an ATP-regenerating system, including phosphoenolpyruvate (12.5 mm) and pyruvate kinase (100 units/ml). Both solutions were mixed with a gradient mixer so that the Ca2+ concentration was incrementally increased every 15 s. Fibers were fixed in a “slack” position in relaxation solution (for composition see above), and fiber length was adjusted to an extent where resting tension was just threshold. Measurement of developed tension and myofibrillar ATPase activity started 3 s after the solution was exchanged when a stable plateau was reached. At the end of the experiment, the NADH decline was determined by perfusion with a defined solution not containing NADH (in mmol/liter: imidazole 20, NaN3 5, EGTA 5, MgCl2 12.5, phosphoenol-pyruvate 5, calcium 5) as well as with the use of a the same solution plus 600 μmol/liter NADH. These solutions did not contain additional calcium. Calibration of the signal was performed under conditions of a continuous perfusion of the respective calibration solutions until a stable signal had been reached. Free Ca2+ concentration was determined by calculator programs designed for experiments in skinned muscle cells (27Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1979; 75: 463-505Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at 25 °C. The ratio of ATPase activity and force was assumed as a measure for “tension cost.” Table 1 summarizes the parameters measured to characterize myofibrillar function.TABLE 1Parameters characterizing tension development, myofibrillar ATPase activity, and energy consumptionParameterDefinitionAbbreviationCa2+-activated tension developmentMaximally Ca2+-activated tensionTension development at pCa 4.5DTmaxCa2+ sensitivity of tensionConcentration of free Ca2+ at which a 50% increase in tension is achievedpCa50 DTHill coefficientSteepness of the Ca2+ tension relationshipnHillCa2+-myofibrillar ATPase activityBasal myofibrillar ATPase activityMyosin ATPase activity measured at pCa 8MYObasMaximal myofibrillar ATPase activityMyosin ATPase activity measured at pCa 4.5MYOmaxCa2+-activated myofibrillar ATPase activityMYO max-MYO basΔMYOCa2+ sensitivity of myofibrillar ATPaseConcentration of free Ca2+ at which a 50% increase in myosin ATPase activity is achievedpCa50 MYOEnergy utilizationSlope of the ATPase/tension relationαX-interceptX-intercept Open table in a new tab Salts used were high analytical grade, purchased from Merck.

Student's t test or paired t test were used to test for significance. p values of <0.05 were accepted as significant. pCa force as well as pCa myofibrillar ATPase activity relationships were fitted by a modified Hill equation (28Hill A.V. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1910; 40: 463-505Google Scholar), Equation 1, Y=Ca2+H/pCa50H+Ca2+H(Eq. 1) where Y is the fractional force, or actomyosin-ATPase activity, pCa50 is the Ca2+ concentration giving half-maximal activation (inhibition), and H is an index of cooperativity (Hill coefficient). The pCa50 for tension development or myofibrillar ATPase activity, all Hill coefficients, and the tension cost were analyzed by Graph Pad Prism (San Diego). Frequency-dependent Alterations of Force and Ca2+ Transients in Right Ventricular Muscle Strips of TnT Transgenic Rats—It has been proposed that the impaired cardiac relaxation observed in working heart models of transgenic mice expressing a truncated TnT molecule might involve altered intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis (20Tardiff J.C.

To investigate whether dysregulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis is present in DEL-TnT transgenic rats, simultaneous measurements of the intracellular Ca2+ transient and force of contraction were performed at 0.25 and 1.0 Hz. Table 2 and Fig. 1 summarize the results obtained for the frequency-dependent changes of the isometric force of contraction as well as intracellular Ca2+ transients.TABLE 2Frequency-dependent alterations of force in TnT transgenic ratsForceCa2+ transientForceTPTT1/2T+dP/dt-dP/dtFurasysFuradiamn/mm2msmsmn/(mm2·s)mn/(mm2·s)0.25 HzNT19.3 ± 1.1222 ± 8141 ± 787.1 ± 5.2137.7 ± 9.32.02 ± 0.031.77 ± 0.04TnT24.0 ± 5.0*241 ± 36150 ± 43109.2 ± 33.5*201.8 ± 30.0*2.18 ± 0.05*1.97 ± 0.06*DEL-TnT9.9 ± 1.7*,#213 ± 8131 ± 446.3 ± 7.5*,#76.6 ± 13.4*,#2.20 ± 0.151.90 ± 0.191.0 HzNT16.0 ± 0.9+174 ± 6+112 ± 4+94.0 ± 7.8146.0 ± 13.12.05 ± 0.02+1.89 ± 0.03+TnT21.6 ± 2.6+,*186 ± 17+113 ± 12+123.7 ± 20.7*201.5 ± 76.3*2.21 ± 0.06*2.06 ± 0.06+,*DEL-TnT7.1 ± 0.9+,*,#176 ± 6+111 ± 5+41.0 ± 5.8*,#65.9 ± 10.1*,#2.21 ± 0.152.04 ± 0.18+ Open table in a new tab Force—At a stimulation frequency of 0.25 Hz, FOC as well as contraction (+dP/dt) and relaxation (–dP/dt) velocities were markedly decreased in rats expressing the truncated human cardiac TnT molecule (DEL-TnT) and both compared with TnT transgenic and NT rats (Fig. 1A). Conversely, FOC, +dP/dt and –dP/dt values were significantly increased in rats expressing the nonmutated human cardiac TnT molecule (TnT) compared with nontransgenic controls. The same pattern was observed at the higher stimulation frequency of 1.0 Hz. Again, DEL-TnT rats displayed impaired contractile function, whereas TnT-rats showed “supranormal” contractile behavior (Table 2 and Fig. 1A). In all three experimental groups, a comparable frequency-dependent decline in force of contraction was observed (NT, –24.2 ± 5.2%; hTnT, –18.4 ± 3.8%; DEL-TnT, –19.3 ± 2.6%). Ca2+ Transients—At 0.25 Hz, fura-2 amplitudes were similar in all three experimental groups. Also, diastolic and systolic fura-2 ratios were not significantly different in DEL-TnT papillary muscles compared with nontransgenic controls, whereas diastolic and systolic fura-2 ratios were found elevated in rats expressing the nonmutated human TnT (Table 2). An elevation of the stimulation frequency to 1 Hz was accompanied by a comparable increase in diastolic fura-2 ratio in all three groups (Table 2). Systolic and diastolic fura-2 ratios were again significantly increased in TnT rats compared with NT rats. At higher stimulation frequencies, the amplitude of the intracellular Ca2+ transient declined to a similar degree in all three experimental groups investigated. Time to peak Ca2+ transient and time to half-peak Ca2+ transient decays were not significantly different in DEL-TnT, TnT, and NT rats at 0.25 Hz. However, at a higher stimulation frequency (1.0 Hz), both time to peak Ca2+ transients as well as time to half-peak Ca2+ transient decays were prolonged in the DEL-TnT group compared with TnT rats (Fig. 1). Tension Development and Myofibrillar ATPase Activity in DEL-TnT Transgenic Rat Hearts—To examine the possible influence of the cardiac troponin T truncation mutation (DEL-TnT) on tension-dependent ATP utilization in the transgenic model, simultaneous measurements of tension and myofibrillar ATPase activity were performed in skinned fibers at increasing extracellular Ca2+ concentrations. Fig. 2 shows representative original tracings of the experiments. Fig. 3 and Table 3 summarize the results.FIGURE 3Concentration-response curves for Ca2+ on isometric tension development and myofibrillar ATPase activity in ventricular skinned fiber preparations of nontransgenic rats (NT) (n = 13), rats expressing a human TnT molecule with a truncation mutation (DEL-TnT)(n = 9), and rats expressing the human TnT molecule (TnT)(n = 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 3Tension development, myofibrillar ATPase activity, and tension cost in TnT transgenic ratsParameterNT (n = 13)DEL-TnT (n = 9)TnT (n = 6)Tension developmentMaximum (mn/mm2)11.3 ± 1.47.2 ± 1.4#24.3 ± 4.3*pCa50 (μm)1.47 ± 0.162.84 ± 0.43*#1.77 ± 0.49DTHill3.8 ± 0.24.9 ± 0.4*5.4 ± 0.8*Myofibrillar ATPase activityBasal (μmol ADP/s)31 ± 731 ± 6#90 ± 15*Maximum (μmol ADP/s)60 ± 1064 ± 15#142 ± 18*Ca2+ activity increase (μmol ADP/s)29 ± 533 ± 9#52 ± 8*pCa50 (μm)1.16 ± 0.222.65 ± 0.76*2.50 ± 1.25Tension costα ((mn·mm-2)/(μmol ADP·s-1))0.74 ± 0.150.31 ± 0.04*#0.73 ± 0.11X-intercept (μmol ADP/s)29 ± 534 ± 7#95 ± 24* Open table in a new tab In DEL-TnT rats, maximal Ca2+-activated tension and Ca2+ sensitivity of tension development were significantly decreased compared with rats expressing the nontruncated human TnT molecule (Table 3). The steepness (nHill) of the Ca2+ tension relationship was increased to a similar degree in DEL-TnT and TnT compared with NT fibers (Table 3). The expression of a truncated TnT molecule in transgenic rat hearts did not significantly alter basal and maximal myofilament ATPase activity nor the Ca2+-dependent increase in actomyosin-ATPase activity compared with nontransgenic controls. However, Ca2+ sensitivity of the myofibrillar ATPase activity was significantly shifted to the right in DEL-TnT compared with NT rats (p < 0.05; Table 3). Tension Development and Myofibrillar ATPase Activity in TnT Transgenic Rat Hearts—To investigate whether myofibrillar function might also be altered by expressing the nontruncated human TnT molecule in rat myocardium, simultaneous measurements of tension and myofibrillar ATPase activity were performed in skinned fibers from these animals. Fig. 2 shows representative original tracings of the experiments. Fig. 3 and Table 3 summarize the results. In TnT rats, maximal Ca2+-activated tension was significantly increased compared with both DEL-TnT and NT fibers, whereas Ca2+ sensitivity of tension development was not different (Table 3). Moreover, basal and maximal ATPase activity as well as the Hill coefficient of the Ca2+/tension relation, which characterizes the cooperativity of the myofilaments, were significantly increased compared with NT rats (Fig. 3 and Table 3). These results imply that the incorporation of a full-length human TnT molecule into the myofilaments may increase the actin-myosin interaction and thus increase ATP turnover. In contrast, myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity of tension was not significantly influenced by the expression of a human TnT molecule in rat cardiac tissue. Tension Cost in TnT and TnT-DEL Rats—Tension-dependent ATP utilization, a parameter reflecting myofibrillar economy, was analyzed by the ratio of myofibrillar ATPase activity over tension (tension cost). Although TnT transgenic rats showed a tension cost ratio (0.71) comparable with nontransgenicrats (0.74), the slope of tension-dependent ATP utilization was significantly decreased in the DEL-TnT group (0.31; p < 0.05 (Table 3 and Fig. 4)). Myofibrillar ATP consumption was thus markedly increased in rats expressing a truncated TnT molecule compared with controls. Although multiple mutations in sarcomeric genes have been found in patients with FHC, the pathogenesis of the disease remains poorly understood. We have previously established a transgenic rat model for FHC that displays typical FHC features, such as diastolic dysfunction and a propensity toward arrhythmias (18Frey N. Franz W.M. Gloeckner K. Degenhardt M. Muller M. Muller O. Merz H. Katus H.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 47: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To gain additional insight into the pathophysiology of this animal model, this present study investigated myofibrillar tension development, intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, and actomyosin ATPase activity in hearts of DEL-TnT transgenic rats. Our findings demonstrate that a C-terminal truncation of the cardiac TnT molecule markedly impairs the force-generating capacity of the cycling cross-bridges. In addition, calcium transients were altered in transgenic rats expressing mutant TnT but not in animals carrying a nonmutated human TnT transgene. Finally, significantly increased tension-dependent ATP utilization was observed in DEL-TnT rats, suggesting that compromised cardiac energy homeostasis contributes to the pathogenesis of FHC. Reduced Myofibrillar Tension Development because of a Truncation of the Human TnT Molecule—In isolated working heart preparations from transgenic rats, we have shown previously that DEL-TnT hearts display contractile dysfunction, whereas hearts expressing nonmutated human TnT actually reveal enhanced contractility compared with wild-type controls. We could now corroborate and extend these findings by measuring FOC in isolated papillary muscle strips as well as tension development in skinned fiber preparations. Again, DEL-TnT resulted in significant depression of FOC, whereas a nonmutated human TnT improved FOC and tension development, respectively. Although it is now widely accepted that a dominant-negative mechanism accounts for the deleterious effects of sarcomeric protein mutations in FHC (3Arad M. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Hum. Mol.

This process involves multiple protein components, including the CPSF (cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor), which is also required for nuclear polyadenylation. The CstF (cleavage stimulatory factor), with CPSF, is required for the pre-mRNA cleavage before nuclear polyadenylation. However, some evidence suggests that the CstF-77 subunit might have a function independent of nuclear polyadenylation, which could be related to the cell cycle. As such, we addressed the question whether CstF-77 might have a role in cytoplasmic polyadenylation. We investigated the function of the CstF-77 protein in Xenopus oocytes, and show that CstF-77 has indeed a role in the cytoplasm. The Xenopus CstF-77 protein (X77K) localizes mainly to the nucleus, but also in punctuate cytoplasmic foci. We show that X77K resides in a cytoplasmic complex with eIF4E, CPEB (cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein), CPSF-100 and XGLD2, but is not required for cytoplasmic polyadenylation per se. Impairment of X77K function in ovo leads to an acceleration of the G2/M transition, with a premature synthesis of Mos and AuroraA proteins. However, the kinetic of Mos mRNA polyadenylation is not modified. Furthermore, X77K represses mRNA translation in vitro. These results suggest that X77K could be involved in masking of mRNA prior to polyadenylation.

In eukaryotes, formation of the mature 3′-end of a messenger RNA is a two-step reaction that involves cleavage of the nascent transcript and subsequent polyadenylation in the nucleus (reviewed in Refs. 1Zhao J.

In mammals, the cleavage reaction requires two sequences, the highly conserved hexanucleotide AAUAAA located 30–20 nucleotides upstream of the cleavage site, and the G/U-rich sequence that lies downstream of the 3′-cleavage site (DSE for downstream element). These sequences are bound by different multisubunit factors. The cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) 3The abbreviations used are: CPSF, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor; CF, cleavage factor; UTR, untranslated region; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RPA, replication protein A; HA, hemagglutinin; ORF, open reading frame; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; NLS, nuclear localization signal; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; CPEB, cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein; PRE, polyadenylation response element.

CPSF and CstF are known to interact cooperatively at 3′-end signals (6Gilmartin G.M. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 2432-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and allow pre-mRNA cleavage with the cleavage factors I and II (CFI and CFII), the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II and the poly(A) polymerase (PAP). CPSF consists of the 160K, 100K, 73K, 30K, and hFip proteins (7Bienroth S. Wahle E. Suter-Crazzolara C. Keller W. J. Biol.

CstF-77 is the subunit required for integrity of the CstF complex. CstF-77 binds to CstF-64, CstF-50 (12Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Mol.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2672-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and therefore helps to hold together the much larger complete polyadenylation complex. CPSF is also involved in cytoplasmic polyadenylation (13Bilger A. Fox C.A. Whale E. Wickens M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1106-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 14Dickson K.S. Bilger A. Ballantyne S. Wickens M.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 5707-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), a mechanism of controlling translation which is often used when transcription is quiescent, such as in oocytes or early embryos. In Xenopus oocytes, several dormant mRNAs are stored with short poly(A) tails, which are elongated when oocytes are stimulated by progesterone, provoking their translation. Cytoplasmic polyadenylation in frog oocytes also requires two sequences on the 3′-UTR of target mRNAs, recognized by multiple protein components (reviewed in Ref. 15Mendez R. Richter J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). CPEB directly binds to the CPE (cytoplasmic polyadenylation element) located upstream of the AAUAAA sequence, which is recognized by CPSF, as in nuclear polyadenylation (14Dickson K.S. Bilger A. Ballantyne S. Wickens M.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 5707-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). CPEB interacts with CPSF, which may help to stabilize its association with the AAUAAA element and a cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase. GLD2, a poly(A) polymerase which is structurally distinguishable from nuclear PAP, was first identified in Caenorhabditis elegans (16Wang L. Eckmann C.R. Kadyk L.C. Wickens M. Kimble J. Nature. 2002; 419: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The Xenopus-related protein (XGLD2) was shown to bind to CPEB and CPSF and to participate in cytoplasmic polyadenylation (17Rouhana L. Wang L. Buter N. Kwak J.E. Schiltz C.A. Gonzalez T. Kelley A.E.

Sequences other than the CPE, the PRE sequences (polyadenylation response element), regulate early cytoplasmic polyadenylation of specific mRNAs including Mos (19Charlesworth A. Cox L.L.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2798-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The CPEB protein has been shown to repress mRNA translation in immature oocytes and to direct cytoplasmic polyadenylation and translational activation in maturing oocytes. Indeed, mRNA translation repression is controlled by a complex composed of CPEB, Maskin, and eIF4E. Maskin interacts with CPEB and eIF4E and prevents eIF4G binding to eIF4E. After stimulation, CPEB is phosphorylated and cytoplasmic polyadenylation ensues, allowing disruption of Maskin-eIF4E binding and recruitment of eIF4G (21Stebbins-Boaz B. Cao Q. de Moor C.H.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster homologues of CstF-77 are, respectively, the Rna14 and Su(f) proteins. Several genetic and biochemical studies have shown a role for Rna14 in 3′-end processing (23Minvielle-Sebastia L. Preker P.J. Keller W. Science. 1994; 266: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 24Mandart E. Parker R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 6979-6986Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Mandart E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), although other studies for Rna14 have suggested a function independent of nuclear polyadenylation. Indeed, rna14 mutants can be separated into two classes: the poly(A)-negative class, which contains mutants deficient in mRNA 3′-processing, and the poly(A)-positive class, which includes mutants that are not impaired in nuclear polyadenylation (26Rouillard J.M. Brendolise C. Lacroute F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 262: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 27Brendolise C. Rouillard J.M. Dufour M.E. Lacroute F. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 267: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Rna14 and Su(f) localize both to the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In yeast, this cytoplasmic localization is mainly in mitochondria (26Rouillard J.M. Brendolise C. Lacroute F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 262: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 28Bonneaud N. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Cullin C. Lacroute F. J. Cell Science. 1994; 107: 913-921PubMed Google Scholar). However, no mitochondrial function for Rna14 has been described so far. In D. melanogaster, the Su(f) protein has been implicated in cell cycle progression (29Audibert A. Simonelig M. Mech. Dev. 1999; 82: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In Xenopus and human cells, studies have shown that CstF-77, CstF-64, and CPSF-100 are concentrated in nuclear domains in Cajal or coiled bodies (30Schul W. Groenhout B. Koberna K. Takagaki Y.

Cell. 2001; 12: 3046-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) as well as various components required for transcription and processing of the three classes of nuclear transcript (reviewed in Ref. 34Gall J.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 975-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, nothing was reported concerning a possible cytoplasmic localization of the CstF subunits. The aim of our work was to study the cytoplasmic function of CstF-77, bearing in mind possible roles independent of nuclear polyadenylation that could be related to the cell cycle. We therefore addressed the question of whether CstF-77 could have a role in cytoplasmic polyadenylation. The Xenopus oocyte is an appropriate model to study other functions of CstF-77, as there is neither transcription nor nuclear polyadenylation during oocyte maturation (15Mendez R. Richter J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). In this report, we identify the Xenopus CstF-77 protein (X77K) and show that it is partially localized in the cytoplasm. We demonstrate that X77K belongs to a cytoplasmic complex with eIF4E, CPEB, CPSF-100, and XGLD2. However, the protein is not required for cytoplasmic polyadenylation per se. Inhibition of X77K function in oocytes accelerates meiotic maturation and precociously induces Mos and AuroraA protein synthesis, without modifying the kinetic of Mos mRNA polyadenylation. Moreover, X77K inhibits in vitro mRNA translation in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that X77K could have a function in mRNA masking prior to cytoplasmic polyadenylation. X77K Cloning and Protein Alignment—A Xenopus leavis oocyte cDNA library in λgt11 from Clontech (ZL5000b) was screened with a 1.030-base pair (bp) probe obtained by RT-PCR from Xenopus RNA with the following degenerated oligonucleotides (Eurogentec): 5′-ATGGCYMARGCWTAYGAYTTYGCACT-3′ and 5′-ACKCKSGTRTTRTTRTCYTCRTTBAG-3′ where Y = C + T, M = A + C, R = A + G, W = A + T, K = T + G, S = C + G and B = T + C + G. Several clones containing the cDNA of the Xenopus CstF-77 homologue (X77K) were isolated and sequenced. The largest cDNA (about 2.300 bp) was subcloned at the EcoR1 site of the pBluescript II KS. It contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 719 amino acids. This X77K amino acid sequence was aligned with those of Homo sapiens CstF-77 (NP001317), Mus musculus CstF-77 (AAH03241), D. melanogaster Su(f) (P25991), C. elegans CstF-77 (AAA62311) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA14 (NP013777) with the ClustalW program. The X77K sequence was submitted to GenBank™ with the following accession number: AM071387. Xenopus Oocytes and Embryos—Stage VI oocytes were selected after surgical removal of ovaries from mature female X. laevis and treatment with collagenase (Sigma) at 1 mg/ml in OR-2 (5 mm Hepes pH 7.2, 82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2). All further manipulations of oocytes were performed in modified Ringer's Solution (MMR: 5 mm Hepes pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm CaCl2). Progesterone was used at a final concentration of 1 mm. For protein oocyte extracts, oocytes were homogenized at 5 μl per oocyte in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, plus 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, chymostatin, pepstatin, and aprotinin) at 4 °C, centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for further analysis. For manually enucleated oocytes, nucleus were collected and boiled in 5× Laëmmli buffer, and the cytoplasm was homogenized at 5 μl per cytoplasm in lysis buffer. In vitro fertilization and embryo cultivation was carried out as described (35Newport J. Kirschner M. Cell. 1982; 30: 675-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). The quantification of proteins in oocyte and embryo extracts was done by Bio-Rad protein assay, with quantified BSA as standard. For microinjections, the usual injected volume for antibodies, purified protein, or RNA was 20–40 nl per oocyte and the number of injected oocytes is 35 for each condition. Antibodies and Western Blots—The anti-pTpY-MAPK was obtained from New England Biolabs (9106S). The anti-eIF4E was provided by S. Morley or was obtained from mouse antisera using the same peptide antigen. The anti-CPSF-100 and the anti-Pak5 were provided by E. Wahle and N. Morin's laboratories, respectively. The anti-β tubulin and anti-HA antibodies were obtained from E7 (Iowa hybridoma bank) and from the 12CA5 hybridomas, respectively. The anti-RPA and anti-AuroraA were provided by J. M. Lemaître and C. Prigent, respectively. The anti-Mos, anti-ERK and IgG were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-086, sc-94 and sc-2027, respectively). Other antibodies used against GST and Xenopus 77K, CPEB and GLD2 are rabbit polyclonal antisera and were affinity-purified. The 77K Cter antibody is directed against the 17 amino acids C-terminal of the human 77K protein: NH2-VPPVHDIYRARQQKRIR-COOH that was kindly provided by David Bentley, and the 573 antibody is directed against the following X77K peptide: NH2-LKDDVDRKPEYPKPD-COOH. The anti-CPEB antibody is directed against GST-CPEB fusion protein as described (36Hake L.E. Richter J.D. Cell. 1994; 79: 617-627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The anti-XGLD2 antibody is directed against the GST-XGLD2 2/3 C-terminal fusion protein. For microinjections, dialyzed antibodies were used at 1 μg/μl. Western blots were probed with primary antibody at 50 ng/ml and the appropriate secondary antibody horseradish peroxidase conjugate diluted according to manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Biosciences) and revealed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). RNA and Recombinant Proteins—The Mos 3′-UTR construct was obtained by inserting the SpeI/XbaI fragment from the pT7-G UK XMos plasmid kindly provided by N. Sagata (37Sagata N. Oskarsson M. Copeland T. Brumbaugh J. Vande Woude G.F. Nature. 1988; 335: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) into SpeI/XbaI-digested pCS2 (Dave Tumer, University of Michigan). This 320-nucleotide fragment contains Mos PRE, CPE, and AAUAAA sequences. Mos 3′-UTR RNA were prepared by linearizing the pCS2-Mos320 with XbaI and carrying out transcription reaction according to Papin and Smith (38Papin C. Smith J.C. Dev. Biol. 2000; 217: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The pCSH vector corresponds to the pCS2 vector with two HA tags inserted in the multiple cloning site. Capped mRNA encoding HA-X77K, HA-XGLD2 and HA-CPEB were prepared by cutting the pCSH-X77K ORF, pCSH-XGLD2 ORF, and pCSH-CPEB ORF, respectively with NotI and carrying out transcription reaction. Immunoprecipitation—Protein oocyte extracts corresponding to 20 oocytes were performed in extract buffer (100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CaCL2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes pH 7.6, 50 mm sucrose, plus 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, chymostatin, pepstatin, and aprotinin). For some experiments, the oocyte extracts were treated 10 min at room temperature with RNase A at 0,02 mg/ml. Oocyte extracts were incubated with 200 ng of antibodies over night at 4 °C on wheel, supplemented with 20 μlof protein A-Sepharose beads and mixed for another 45 min at 4 °C on wheel. The immunoprecipitates were then washed three times in XRB A (0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA), three times in XRB B (0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris pH 8, 500 mm NaCl and 2 mm EDTA) and two times in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, eluted by boiling in 2× Laëmmli buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. For immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled X77K, 1 μg of 77K antibody was incubated or not with 10 μg of its antigen (77K Cter peptide coupled with thyroglobulin) before being applied to protein A-Sepharose beads for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with PBS, supplemented with [35S]methionine X77K translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, and mixed 1 h on ice. The immunoprecipitates were then washed three times in XRB A, three times in XRB B, and two times in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, eluted by boiling in 2× Laëmmli buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. Cap Column and GST Pull-down Assay—The cap column assay was performed as described (22Cao Q. Richter J.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3852-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 oocytes were homogenized in homogenization buffer (HB), and treated or not 10 min at room temperature with RNase A (0,02 mg/ml). The oocyte supernatants were supplemented with 0.1 mm GTP or 5 mm 7mGTP and applied in batch to a 7mGTP-Sepharose (cap) column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with HB plus bovine serum albumin (BSA, 0.1 mg/ml). Following mixing for 1 h at 4 °C in Eppendorf tube, the cap column was extensively washed (100 bed volumes) with 0.1 m KCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The bound material was then eluted with 5 mm 7mGTP on column. The eluates and a fraction of oocyte lysates collected before and after mixing with the cap column were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. The GST pull-down assay was performed as described (39Nakamura A. Sato K. Hanyu-Nakamura K. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 69-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Briefly, HA-tagged CPEB and HA-tagged XGLD2 were in vitro translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega) in the presence of unlabeled amino acids. GST-X77K expressed in Baculovirus and GST expressed in E. coli were purified with glutathione Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). 5 μg of purified GST-X77K or GST were bound to 20 μl of glutathione beads in binding buffer. The beads were subsequently incubated 2h at room temperature in 400 μl of binding buffer plus 5 μg of the HA-CPEB or HA-XGLD2. The beads were then extensively washed with binding buffer and boiled in 2× Laëmmli buffer. The eluates and inputs were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Polyadenylation Assays—Total RNA from oocytes was extracted using the Mini RNA Isolation II™ kit (Zymo Research) and the PAT (polyadenylation test) assay was carried out according to Salles and Strickland (40Salles F.J. Strickland S. PCR Methods Appl. 1995; 4: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Reverse transcription was done on total RNA with oligo(dT)-anchor (dT-PAT) as primer (5′-GCGAGCTCCGCGGCCGCGT(12)-3′). Subsequent PCR was carried out using the dT-PAT primer and a specific upstream primer for Mos 3′-UTR RNA (5′-GCACTGAAAATACAAGCAAGGATATG-3′), cyclin B1 ORF RNA (5′-GTGGAAATGGCCCGCCCACTC-3′), AuroraA 3′-UTR RNA (5′-GGCTGTCACCGTACAACGCTACTTG-3′), and actin type 5 3′-UTR RNA (5′-CAAATGTTGCAGGTACACCTG-3′). The PCR products were resolved in a 2.5% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. For in vitro polyadenylation assays, egg extracts were prepared according to Murray and Kirschner (41Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1989; 339: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Egg extracts were adjusted to 1 mm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2, 7.5 mm creatine phosphate and 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 7.7. 30 ng of Mos 3′-UTR RNA was added to the egg extract and the polyadenylation assay was carried out at 23 °C for 1 h, prior to RNA extraction as described in McGrew and Richter (42McGrew L.L. Richter J.D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3743-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Mos 3′-UTR polyadenylation analysis was carried out as described above (PAT assay). For depletion experiments, 2 μg of antibodies were incubated 30 min at 4 °C with 15 μl of Dynabead protein A beads (Dynal). Beads were washed three times with PBS plus 100 μg/ml BSA and incubated with 15 μl of egg extract for 30 min at room temperature. After precipitation, depleted extract was collected, and used for polyadenylation assay and Western blot analysis. Bead precipitates were eluted by boiling in 2× Laëmmli buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. In Vitro Translation in Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate (RRL)—The luciferase translation assay was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega). 100 ng of Luciferase mRNA (provided in RRL kit) were added to 10 μlofRRL in the presence of [35S]methionine (2 μl, 1000 Ci/mmol, methionine/cysteine mix, Amersham Biosciences) with or without the indicated quantities of GST-77K or GST proteins, for 1.5 h at 30 °C. The equivalent of 20% of the reaction was used for autoradiography and Western blot analysis. The amount of proteins added to the reaction was analyzed by Coomassie staining. The luciferase RNA was analyzed by RT-PCR after the reaction. Reverse transcription was done with random primers and the amplification with the following oligonucleotides: 5′-AAGCCACCATGGAAGA-3′ and 5′-CTCTAGAATTACACGGCGATC-3′. Cell Culture and Immunofluorescence—Mouse NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Xenopus XTC cells were cultured in 70% L15 Leibovitch's Media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in hermetic tissue culture flask at 25 °C. Cultured cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were then permeabilized in PBS containing 1% Triton-X100 for 10 min at room temperature and blocked in PBS containing 0.1% Tween and 3% BSA (blocking reagent). Antibody incubations were done 1 h at room temperature in blocking reagent followed by secondary Alexa-546-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) used in identical conditions. DNA was visualized by DAPI staining. Identification of Xenopus CstF-77 Homologue—A X. laevis oocyte library was screened with a probe made by RT-PCR from Xenopus oocyte RNA and degenerate oligonucleotides. A cDNA encoding the Xenopus homologue of CstF-77 was isolated. This cDNA contains an ORF encoding a protein of 719 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 83 kDa that we named X77K. We identified a domain organization similar to the known CstF-77 homologues, with 11 HAT (half a TPR) repeats, a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a proline-rich domain at the C terminus (Fig. 1). Apart from the NLS, these domains are known to mediate protein-protein interactions, and the HAT repeats have been described to be specific to a family of proteins involved in RNA processing (11Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Nature. 1994; 372: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 43Preker P.J. Keller W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 15-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For the human CstF-77 protein, the proline-rich domain has been shown to be necessary both for binding other CstF subunits and also for self association (12Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1515-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the CstF-77 proteins are highly conserved, since the amino acid sequence of X77K shares 94% identity overall with the human and mouse CstF-77 proteins, 57% with D. melanogaster protein and 27% with S. cerevisiae protein (Fig. S1). CstF-77 Is Localized Both in the Nucleus and Cytoplasm—To study the expression of X77K protein, we raised a polyclonal antibody against the human C-terminal peptide (77K antibody). By Western blotting, this antibody recognizes the HA-tagged X77K expressed in oocytes, and the purified Baculovirus GST-X77K protein (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 5). It also detects endogenous Xenopus CstF-77 protein from oocytes or cell lysates (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 3, respectively) and endogenous mouse (lane 4) and human protein (not shown). Moreover, the in vitro translated X77K protein is immunoprecipitated by the 77K antibody but not by the 77K antibody preincubated with the peptide antigen (Fig. 2B). These results show the specificity of the 77K antibody for the 77K protein. A Western blot analysis on oocyte and embryo lysates shows that X77K is expressed at a constant level during Xenopus oogenesis and embryogenesis up to stage 40 (Fig. 3, A and B). In S. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster, the CstF-77 homologues Rna14 and Su(f) respectively localize both to the nucleus and cytoplasm (28Bonneaud N. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Cullin C. Lacroute F. J. Cell Science. 1994; 107: 913-921PubMed Google Scholar, 44Audibert A. Juge F. Simonelig M. Mech. Dev. 1998; 72: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In Xenopus oocytes, the nuclear localization of X77K has been well determined, where it is present in Cajal bodies and lampbrush chromosomes (32Gall J.G. Bellini M. Wu Z. Murphy C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4385-4402Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, nothing has been reported concerning a possible cytoplasmic localization. To investigate whether X77K could be cytoplasmic in Xenopus laevis, lysates from nucleus, cytoplasm or total oocytes were analyzed by Western blotting with 77K antibody. Fig. 3C shows that X77K is mainly nuclear, but is also present in the cytoplasm. We verified that cytoplasmic extracts were not contaminated with nuclear extracts by probing the membrane for the nuclear protein RPA (replication protein A). This double localization was confirmed by immunofluorescence experiments on Xenopus XTC and mouse NIH3T3 cell lines (Fig. 3D): CstF-77 protein is mainly in the nucleus but is also localized in punctuated bodies distributed in the whole cytoplasm. These results show that the CstF-77 protein is localized both in the nucleus and cytoplasm in vertebrates, as in S. cerevisiae and Drosophila. As X77K has a functional NLS but partially localizes to the cytoplasm, we investigated whether the protein shuttles between the GV (germinal vesicle) and the cytoplasm, even if it does not present a NES (nuclear export signal). To answer this question, oocytes were treated or not overnight with leptomycin B, a nuclear export inhibitor. They were then enucleated, to analyze whether the protein accumulated in the nucleus in the presence of leptomycin B. In this cond"

We show here that Rbp1p in xrn1Δ mutant yeast localizes in specific cytoplasmic foci that are known as P-bodies. The N-terminal and RNA recognition motif (RRM) 1 domains of Rbp1p are necessary but not sufficient for its localization in P bodies. Rbp1p forms oligomers through its C-terminal domain in vivo; N-terminal-delete, or RRM1-mutated Rbp1p can be more efficiently recruited to P-bodies in an xrn1Δ strain, expressing a full-length Rbp1p. Although POR1 mRNA is localized to P bodies in an xrn1Δ strain, this localization does not depend on Rbp1p. Decapping activator Dhh1p directly interacts with Rbp1p. However, the recruitment of Rbp1p to P-bodies does not require Dhh1p or Ccr4p. In wild-type cells, Rbp1p can localize to P-bodies under glucose deprivation or treatment with KCl. In addition, Rbp1p-mediated porin mRNA decay is elicited by Xrn1p, a 5 ′ to 3 ′ exonuclease. These results provide new insight into the mechanism of Rbp1p function.

Cellular mRNA is associated with proteins from the time of its synthesis until its degradation. In eukaryotic cells, a multitude of RNA-binding proteins play roles in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression (1Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The proper regulation of gene expression is critical for all biological processes. In addition, mRNA turnover plays an important role in mRNA biogenesis and the degradation of aberrant transcripts (2Hilleren P. Parker R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 229-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The process of mRNA turnover is important in numerous aspects of eukaryotic mRNA physiology. For example, mRNA turnover participates in controlling gene expression both by setting the basal level of gene expression and as a site of regulatory responses (3Coller J. Parker R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 861-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Control of mRNA stability provides a means by which a cell can rapidly change its mRNA abundance and, hence, gene expression (for review, see Refs. 4Wilusz C.J. Wormington M. Peltz S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar and 5Parker R. Song H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The process of mRNA degradation includes removal or inactivation of the poly(A) tail, exit from active translation, assembly of a decapping complex on the mRNA, and sequestration of the mRNA into discrete cytoplasmic foci where decapping and 5′ to 3′ degradation occurs (3Coller J. Parker R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 861-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). A major pathway of mRNA degradation in yeast occurs by deadenylation of the mRNA, which leads to a decapping reaction, thereby exposing the mRNA to rapid 5′ to 3′ exonucleolytic degradation (6Tucker M. Parker R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 571-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Some mRNAs also can be degraded in the opposite direction by the exosome, which is a large complex of 3′ to 5′ exonucleases functioning in RNA degradation and processing events. The balance between these two pathways varies among mRNAs and organisms. In yeast, mRNA decapping followed by 5′ to 3′ exonuclease decay occurs in specific cytoplasmic foci, P-bodies (7Sheth U. Parker R. Science. 2003; 300: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). These P-bodies contain decapping enzymes (Dcp1p and Dcp2p), decapping activators (Dhh1p, a complex of Sm-like proteins (Lsm1-7p), and Pat1p), the 5′ to 3′ mRNA exonuclease (Xrn1p), and proteins that bind to the mRNA after deadenylation by a major cytoplasmic deadenylase (Ccr4p). The number of P-bodies is remarkably low, i.e. two or three per cell (8Wickens M. Goldstrohm A. Science. 2003; 300: 753-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that P-bodies require RNA for assembly and contain nontranslating mRNAs, suggesting additional biological roles of P-bodies in addition to being sites of mRNA degradation (9Teixeira D. Sheth U. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Brengues M. Parker R. RNA. 2005; 11: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). We have identified an RNA-binding protein gene (RBP1)in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (10Lee F.J. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15080-15087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rbp1p contains three copies of an RNA recognition motif (RRM), 2The abbreviations used are: RRM, RNA recognition motif; NMP, asparagine/methionine/proline; RFP, red fluorescence protein; UTR, untranslated region; YPD, yeast extract/peptone/dextrose; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription; NLS, nuclear localization signal; TIA-1, T-cell internal antigen-1; TIAR, TIA-1-related protein; CT, C terminus. 2The abbreviations used are: RRM, RNA recognition motif; NMP, asparagine/methionine/proline; RFP, red fluorescence protein; UTR, untranslated region; YPD, yeast extract/peptone/dextrose; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription; NLS, nuclear localization signal; TIA-1, T-cell internal antigen-1; TIAR, TIA-1-related protein; CT, C terminus. two glutamine stretches, and an asparagine/methionine/proline-rich (NMP) region. RBP1 is not an essential gene, but yeast yield a slow growth phenotype with overexpression of Rbp1p. Rbp1p was also reported to be a negative regulator of meiosis and spore formation (11Deutschbauer A.M. Williams R.M. Chu A.M. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15530-15535Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that overexpression of Rbp1p impairs mitochondrial function and affects mitochondrial porin expression. rbp1Δ mutants showed increased stability of porin mRNA compared with wild-type cells, whereas cells overexpressing Rbp1p, but not N-terminal-deleted, or RRM1-, RRM2-, or RRM3-mutated Rbp1p, showed a decrease in the stability of porin mRNA (12Buu L.M. Jang L.T. Lee F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 453-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Rbp1p binds to the 3′-UTR of porin mRNA in vitro, and the three RRMs of Rbp1p are each involved in destabilizing porin mRNA. To understand how Rbp1p regulates porin mRNA decay, we set out to examine the location and mechanisms of mRNA degradation that involve Rbp1p. Here, we show that Rbp1p localizes to P-bodies in an xrn1 strain and that the N terminus, C terminus, and RRM1 domain are involved in this recruitment. Rbp1p interacts with itself in vivo; and in the xrn1Δ strain overexpressing a full-length Rbp1p, N-terminal-deleted or RRM1-mutated Rbp1p can be more efficiently recruited to P-bodies. The efficiency of porin mRNA decay in yeast overexpressing Rbp1p requires Xrn1p. Although Rbp1p directly interacts with Dhh1p, the recruitment of Rbp1p to P-bodies in an xrn1Δ mutant does not require Dhh1p. Together, our results show that self-interaction and unidentified signals in the N-terminal RRM1 domain play an important role in recruitment of Rbp1p to dynamic P-bodies in the absence of Xrn1p. Strains, Media, and Microbiological Techniques—Table 1 lists the yeast strains used in this study. Yeast culture media were prepared as described by Sherman et al. (13Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). YPD contained 1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% glucose. SD contained 0.17% Difco yeast nitrogen base (without amino acids and ammonium sulfate), 0.5% ammonium sulfate, and 2% glucose. Nutrients essential for auxotrophic strains were supplied at specified concentrations (13Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Yeast strains were transformed by the lithium acetate method (14Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J.

Anti-HA (Berkeley Antibody Co., Inc., Richmond, CA, 1:1000) and anti-GST (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, 1:1000) antibodies were used for detection of HA-Rbp1p and GST-Rbp1p, respectively. Anti-GFP antibody (Molecular Probes) was diluted 1:2000. Alexa 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa 594 goat antimouse IgG (Molecular Probes) were used as secondary antibodies at 1:1000 and 1:2000 dilutions, respectively. Nuclei were visualized by staining with H33258 (2 μg/ml), which was included in the mounting solution. Pull-down Assay and RNA Detection by RT-PCR—Cells in which the RBP1 gene was deleted were transformed with plasmids carrying GST-tagged RBP1 and GST-tagged-deleted or -mutated RBP1. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with HB buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 15 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture, 0.4 units/μl RNase inhibitor), and dispersed in HB buffer. Cells were broken by vortex mixing with glass beads, and debris was removed by centrifugation (4000 rpm for 5 min). Each supernatant was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rpm to yield mitochondria-rich pellets (P10). Each P10 pellet was suspended in HB buffer and mixed with glutathione-Sepharose beads (rotation for 5 h at4 °C). The GST-Rbp1p·RNA complex that was bound to beads was recovered by centrifuging at 400 × g for 2 min and was washed 3 times with buffer (HB containing 0.02% Triton X-100). The beads were suspended in HB buffer containing 2 units of DNase I. After rotating at room temperature, the glutathione-Sepharose beads were collected by centrifugation. RNA was extracted with acid phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. POR1 and control mRNAs were identified by RT-PCR using specific primers. To test the binding efficiency, the protein attached to the washed beads was solubilized in an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer (final concentration, 125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 0.1% bromphenol blue), heated for 10 min at 95 °C, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. In Vitro Binding Assay—GST-Rbp1p, GST, His-Rbp1p, and His-Hrp1p were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (18Lee F.J. Huang C.F. Yu W.L. Buu L.M. Lin C.Y. Huang M.C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30998-31005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Purified GST or GST-Rbp1p bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated with purified recombinant His-Rbp1p or His-Hrp1p in 800 μl of binding buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 50 mm KCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2mm MgCl2, 5mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and protease inhibitors) overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads were washed 5 times with binding buffer, 0.02% Tween 20. Bound proteins were eluted with 30 μl of elution buffer (10 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0). Samples were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against the His or GST tag. In Vivo mRNA Labeling—The MS2 RNA labeling system was constructed as described by Bertrand et al. (19Bertrand E. Chartrand P. Schaefer M. Shenoy S.M. Singer R.H. Long R.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 437-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Plasmid pG14-MS2-GFP (a gift of R.H. Singer) contains a fusion between the MS2 coat protein and GFP. Plasmid pG14-MS2-mRFP contains a fusion between the MS2 coat protein and mono red fluorescence protein (RFP). The POR1-6×MS2bs-3′-UTR plasmid contains the PGAL I promoter controlling the expression of the POR1 gene with 6 copies of an MS2 binding site inserted between the stop codon and 3′-UTR. Yeast strains were transformed with various combinations of the episomal vectors and selected on the appropriate selection media to maintain the plasmids. Transformed cells were then grown to mid-log phase in synthetic media containing 2% raffinose. Cells were subsequently induced with 2% galactose for 3 h to induce expression of the reporter mRNA. Because of the variable expression levels of the two plasmids, some cells have particles without much GFP nuclear signal, and some cells have strong GFP nuclear signal without visible particles. RNA Blot and RNA Turnover Analysis—Yeast total RNA was isolated by the hot acid phenol method (20Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (1993) John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). RNA blot analysis was carried out as described previously (10Lee F.J. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15080-15087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used a yeast strain YTC345 carrying a temperature-sensitive RNA polymerase II allele (rpb1-1) (21Muhlrad D. Decker C.J. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2145-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) to study the RNA turnover rate. YTC345 and YTC345 mutants (xrn1Δ, lsm1Δ, dhh1Δ, and upf1Δ) were grown in synthetic medium containing 2% glucose with shaking overnight at 25 °C. An equal volume of 50 °C sterile double-distilled H2O was then added, and the culture was placed in a 37 °C water bath. Samples of cells were withdrawn at the indicated times for RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis. The mRNA decay level was determined by densitometry of Northern blots using an AlphaImager documentation and analysis system (AlphaImager 1220, Version 5.5). The data were processed with SigmaPlot 2000 software for the slope plot. Rbp1p Localizes to P-bodies in xrn1Δ Strains—Recent reports have indicated that certain mRNAs and mRNA processing molecules are localized in distinct cytoplasmic foci. Xrn1p is predominantly localized to the cytoplasm and is excluded from the vacuole and nucleus (22Heyer W.D. Johnson A.W. Reinhart U. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2728-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The xrn1Δ deletion increased the size and number of foci; that is, clogging the pipeline seems to obstruct passage through the mRNA decay system (7Sheth U. Parker R. Science. 2003; 300: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 8Wickens M. Goldstrohm A. Science. 2003; 300: 753-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A previous study showed that Rbp1p is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, with higher concentration in the perinuclear region and some punctuates (12Buu L.M. Jang L.T. Lee F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 453-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Because P-bodies are subcellular sites of mRNA decay, we reasoned that Rbp1p, involved in POR1 mRNA decay, might be transiently associated with these sites just before or during degradation. HA-tagged Rbp1p was overexpressed in wild-type, xrn1Δ, lsm1Δ, dhh1Δ, upf1Δ, and ccr4Δ mutant yeast. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis shows that HA-Rbp1p is localized to large cytoplasmic foci similar to the P-bodies in an xrn1Δ mutant but not in wild-type, lsm1Δ, dhh1Δ, upf1Δ, or ccr4Δ mutants (supplemental Fig. S1). Dhh1p, a DEAD-box protein, interacts with both the decapping complex and components of the deadenylase and acts as an activator for efficient decapping of mRNAs after deadenylation (23Coller J.M. Tucker M. Sheth U. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Parker R. RNA. 2001; 7: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used Dhh1p as a marker for P-bodies as indicated in a previous study (7Sheth U. Parker R. Science. 2003; 300: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). To examine whether endogenous Rbp1p is localized to P-bodies in an xrn1Δ mutant, we generated a yeast strain by integrating 3HA and GFP tags to chromosomal RBP1 and DHH1 genes, respectively. Consistent with a previous report (7Sheth U. Parker R. Science. 2003; 300: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar), we observed large cytoplasmic foci containing Dhh1p-GFP, which are similar to the P-bodies in an xrn1Δ mutant (Fig. 1). The endogenous HA-tagged Rbp1p was also seen in discrete foci in the xrn1Δ mutant and partly co-localized with Dhh1p, suggesting that the Rbp1p-mediated POR1 mRNA degradation possibly takes place at P-bodies. The N Terminus and RRM1 Are Necessary but Not Sufficient for the Recruitment of Rbp1p to P-bodies in xrn1Δ Mutants—To delineate the molecular mechanism of xrn1Δ-dependent translocation, we next determined which domain(s) is responsible for recruiting Rbp1p to P-bodies in an xrn1Δrbp1Δ strain. First, two deletion mutants of Rbp1p were generated lacking either parts of the N-terminal (Rbp1p-dN) or C-terminal region (Rbp1p-dC) (Fig. 2B). Rbp1p-dN and Rbp1p-dC were expressed in an xrn1Δrbp1Δ strain. Fig. 2A shows a loss of signal in P-bodies with Rbp1p-dN and most of Rbp1p-dC. We also examined the C-terminal domain of Rbp1p (Rbp1p-CT) and found that it lost localization to P-bodies. These results indicated that the N terminus of Rbp1p is necessary but not sufficient for its recruitment to P-bodies in the xrn1Δrbp1Δ mutant. The RRM domain of RNA-binding proteins is generally believed to have a functional role in directing RNA binding. To examine whether RRM1, RRM2, or RRM3 is essential for the recruitment of Rbp1p to P-bodies in the xrn1Δ mutant, we next determined the localization of HA-tagged Rbp1p-rrm1, -rrm2, and -rrm3 mutants in an xrn1Δrbp1Δ strain. Fig. 2A shows that HA-Rbp1p-rrm2 and HA-Rbp1p-rrm3 were mostly co-localized with Dhh1p at P-bodies, but a much lower quantity of HA-Rbp1p-rrm1 was co-localized with Dhh1p. These results suggest that RRM2 and RRM3 domains are not essential for Rbp1p localization in P-bodies. The expression of each mutated or truncated form of Rbp1p was verified by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2C). Unexpectedly, when we expressed Rbp1p-dN or Rbp1p-rrm1 in the xrn1Δ strain, which contained endogenous Rbp1p, Rbp1p-dN or Rbp1p-rrm1 were more efficiently recruited to P-bodies than that in the xrn1Δrbp1Δ strain (Fig. 2D). This result suggests that endogenous Rbp1p may have a role in their recruitment to P-bodies. Moreover, Rbp1p, Rbp1p-dN, Rbp1p-dC, and mutants Rbp1p-rrm1, -rrm2, and -rrm3 did not appear to localize at P-bodies in the presence of Xrn1p (supplemental Fig. S2). Overexpression of Full-length Rbp1p Can Recruit Rbp1p-dN and Rbp1p-rrm1 to P-bodies—Rbp1p-dN, Rbp1p-rrm1, and most of Rbp1p-dC lost their signals in P-bodies in an xrn1Δrbp1Δ double mutant. In addition, in the presence of endogenous Rbp1p, Rbp1p-dN and Rbp1p-rrm1 were more efficiently recruited to the P-bodies in the xrn1Δ strain. Thus, we next examined whether overexpression of full-length Rbp1p in an xrn1Δrbp1Δ double mutant could recruit Rbp1p-dN, Rbp1p-dC, Rbp1p-rrm1, and Rbp1p-CT to P-bodies. We generated an engineered yeast strain xrn1Δrbp1Δ-DHH1-GFP-GST-RBP1, which is an xrn1Δrbp1Δ double mutant containing a chromosomal GFP-tagged DHH1 and GST-tagged RBP1 gene under the control of the ADH1 promoter. Both Rbp1p and Dhh1p in this strain were co-localized in P-bodies (supplemental Fig. S3A). The engineered yeast was then transformed with a pVT101U vector expressing HA-Rbp1p, HA-Rbp1p-dN, HA-Rbp1p-dC, or HA-Rbp1prrm1. We show that HA-Rbp1p-dN, HA-Rbp1p-rrm1, and Rbp1p-CT were more efficiently recruited to P-bodies in the xrn1Δrbp1Δ strain when full-length Rbp1p was overexpressed (supplemental Fig. S3B). The expression of each mutated or truncated form of HA-Rbp1p and GST-Rbp1p was verified by Western blot analysis (supplemental Fig. S3C). Although HA-Rbp1p-dC was mostly dispersed in the cytoplasm in the xrn1Δrbp1Δ strain (Fig. 2A), only part of it was recruited to P-bodies when full-length Rbp1p was overexpressed. These results suggest that possible self-interaction of Rbp1p involving at least one copy of full-length Rbp1p may be important for its translocation to P-bodies. Intermolecular Interaction of Rbp1p Requires the C-terminal Domain and Occurs in an RNA-independent Manner—We next addressed whether Rbp1p can interact with itself directly or through association with mRNA or another protein(s) in the Rbp1p·mRNP complex. GST pull-down assays were performed to evaluate the binding of GST-Rbp1p to HA-Rbp1p, HA-Rbp1p-dN, or HA-Rbp1p-dC fusion proteins in vivo. HA-Vps74p, a Golgi-associated protein, served as a control. As shown in Fig. 3A, with or without RNase A treatment Rbp1p exhibited interactions with itself and Rbp1p-dN but not with Rbp1p-dC. Rbp1p had no interaction with the control protein Vps74p. These results suggested that interactions between Rbp1p molecules required its C-terminal domain and occurred in an RNA-independent manner. Intermolecular interaction of Rbp1p was also confirmed by yeast two-hybrid interaction analysis (data not shown). We next generated an HA-Rbp1p-CT fusion protein to determine whether the C-terminal domain is sufficient for this intermolecular interaction. Fig. 3A shows that HA-Rbp1p-CT interacted with GST-Rbp1p, indicating that the C-terminal domain of Rbp1p is necessary and sufficient for intermolecular interaction with Rbp1p. To further substantiate the above findings, purified recombinant His-tagged Rbp1p and His-tagged Hrp1p fusion proteins from E. coli were applied to glutathione-Sepharose beads bound with purified GST or GST-Rbp1p. Hrp1p, which is a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein-like protein and can interact with Rbp1p, 3L.-T. Jang, L.-C. Chang and F.-J. S. Lee, unpublished data. was used as the positive control. Our data showed that His-Rbp1p was retained with GST-Rbp1p on the column (Fig. 3B). Western blot analysis was performed and confirmed the identities of the fusion proteins. These experiments demonstrated that Rbp1p displayed direct interaction with itself in vitro. Rbp1p Interacts with Dhh1p in an RNA-independent Manner—Knowing that Rbp1p and Dhh1p associate with P-bodies in the xrn1Δ mutant, we next examined whether Rbp1p·mRNP interacts with Dhh1p via direct Rbp1p-Dhh1p interaction or through association with mRNA or another protein(s) in a multiprotein complex. GST pull-down assays were performed to evaluate the binding of Dhh1p-GFP to GST-Rbp1p or GST-Rbp1p-dN fusion proteins in vivo in an xrn1Δrbp1Δ mutant. As shown in Fig. 4, Dhh1p interacted with Rbp1p and Rbp1p-dN, but not with GST, even in the presence of RNase A, suggesting a direct interaction between Rbp1p and Dhh1p in an RNA-independent manner. This result also indicates that the N terminus of Rbp1p is not required for interaction with Dhh1p. We also noticed that GST-Rbp1p-dN pulled down more Dhh1p than GST-Rbp1p, suggesting that the conformation of GST-Rbp1p-dN could be changed, resulting in a higher affinity to interact with the Dhh1p than GST-Rbp1p. Because only a portion of Dhh1p co-localized with Rbp1p in the wild-type strain (Fig. 1), we next examined whether Rbp1p and Dhh1p could interact with each other in an rbp1Δ mutant strain, using similar pull-down assays. The result also indicates that Rbp1p interacts with Dhh1p in an RNA-independent manner and in the absence of major P-bodies (supplemental Fig. S4). Yeast two-hybrid analysis further supported the above findings that Rbp1p interacts with Dhh1p (data not shown). Recruitment of Rbp1p to P-bodies Does Not Require Dhh1p or Ccr4p—Knowing that Rbp1p can interact with Dhh1p in vivo, we next examined whether Dhh1p recruits Rbp1p to P-bodies in an xrn1Δ strain. HA-Rbp1p was overexpressed in rbp1Δxrn1Δ or rbp1Δxrn1Δdhh1Δ mutant cells. Fig. 5A shows that HA-Rbp1p formed cytoplasmic foci in the absence of Dhh1p, suggesting that recruitment of Rbp1p to P-bodies in the xrn1Δ strain is not dependent on Dhh1p. To determine whether Ccr4p is required for recruitment of Rbp1p to P-bodies in the xrn1Δ strain, we overexpressed HA-Rbp1p in rbp1Δxrn1Δ or rbp1Δxrn1Δccr4Δ mutant cells. Fig. 5B shows that HA-Rbp1p formed cytoplasmic foci in rbp1Δxrn1Δccr4Δ cells, suggesting that proteins involved in deadenylation are not required for recruitment of Rbp1p to P-bodies. Ability of Rbp1p and Its Deletion or Mutation Constructs to Bind to mRNA in Vivo—The size of P-bodies is proportional to the flux of mRNAs undergoing the decapping step in turnover. In addition, mRNA decay intermediates trapped in the process of degradation are also localized to P-bodies. We next asked whether the recruitment of Rbp1p to P-bodies is dependent on its mRNA binding ability. GST fusion constructs of Rbp1p mutants or fragments were expressed under the control of the ADH1 promoter in an rbp1 mutant. With the notion that P-bodies could be enriched by sedimentation centrifugation in the P10 fraction (9Teixeira D. Sheth U. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Brengues M. Parker R. RNA. 2005; 11: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), we first examined whether GST-Rbp1p is enriched in the P10 fraction. The cytoplasmic extracts of yeast rbp1Δ-DHH1-GFP-LEU2:ADH1p-GST-RBP1 and rbp1Δ-DCP2-GFP-LEU2:ADH1p-GST-RBP1 were separated into P10 and S10 fractions by sedimentation centrifugation, and Rbp1p, Dhh1p, Dcp2p, Pma1p (plasma membrane marker), Por1p (mitochondrial marker), and Pgk1p (cytoplasmic marker) were identified in each fraction by Western blot analysis (supplemental Fig. S5). Our data showed that GST-Rbp1p, like P-body markers Dhh1p-GFP and Dcp2p-GFP, appeared in the P10 fraction. P-bodies-rich pellets (P10) obtained from cytoplasmic extracts"
