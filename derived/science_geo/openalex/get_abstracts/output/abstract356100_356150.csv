https://openalex.org/W1988163167,"MicroRNAs are endogenous ∼23-nucleotide RNAs that can pair to sites in the messenger RNAs of protein-coding genes to downregulate the expression from these messages. MicroRNAs are known to influence the evolution and stability of many mRNAs, but their global impact on protein output had not been examined. Here we use quantitative mass spectrometry to measure the response of thousands of proteins after introducing microRNAs into cultured cells and after deleting mir-223 in mouse neutrophils. The identities of the responsive proteins indicate that targeting is primarily through seed-matched sites located within favourable predicted contexts in 3′ untranslated regions. Hundreds of genes were directly repressed, albeit each to a modest degree, by individual microRNAs. Although some targets were repressed without detectable changes in mRNA levels, those translationally repressed by more than a third also displayed detectable mRNA destabilization, and, for the more highly repressed targets, mRNA destabilization usually comprised the major component of repression. The impact of microRNAs on the proteome indicated that for most interactions microRNAs act as rheostats to make fine-scale adjustments to protein output. MicroRNAs can regulate gene expression by either inhibiting translation of a messenger RNA, or inducing its degradation. While previous studies have measured regulation at the mRNA level, it was unknown how much regulation occurred at the protein level. Now two groups led by David Bartel and Nikolaus Rajewsky have used variants of the technique known as SILAC (stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture) to measure proteome-wide changes in protein level as a function of expression of endogenous and exogenous microRNAs. They find that while microRNAs can directly repress the translation of hundreds of genes, additional indirect effects result in changes in expression of thousands of genes. Many of the changes observed are less than twofold in magnitude, however, indicating either directly or indirectly, microRNAs can act as rheostats to fine-tune protein synthesis to match the needs of the cell at any given time. In one of two studies, a technique known as SILAC is used to measure, on a large scale, changes in protein level as a function of expression of endogenous and exogenous miRNAs. It is found that although miRNAs directly repress the translation of hundreds of genes, additional indirect effects result in changes in expression of thousands of genes."

https://openalex.org/W1997031801,"Reduced fecundity, associated with severe mental disorders, places negative selection pressure on risk alleles and may explain, in part, why common variants have not been found that confer risk of disorders such as autism, schizophrenia and mental retardation. Thus, rare variants may account for a larger fraction of the overall genetic risk than previously assumed. In contrast to rare single nucleotide mutations, rare copy number variations (CNVs) can be detected using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. This has led to the identification of CNVs associated with mental retardation and autism. In a genome-wide search for CNVs associating with schizophrenia, we used a population-based sample to identify de novo CNVs by analysing 9,878 transmissions from parents to offspring. The 66 de novo CNVs identified were tested for association in a sample of 1,433 schizophrenia cases and 33,250 controls. Three deletions at 1q21.1, 15q11.2 and 15q13.3 showing nominal association with schizophrenia in the first sample (phase I) were followed up in a second sample of 3,285 cases and 7,951 controls (phase II). All three deletions significantly associate with schizophrenia and related psychoses in the combined sample. The identification of these rare, recurrent risk variants, having occurred independently in multiple founders and being subject to negative selection, is important in itself. CNV analysis may also point the way to the identification of additional and more prevalent risk variants in genes and pathways involved in schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2062204035,"The envelope glycoproteins (Env) of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV, respectively) mediate virus binding to the cell surface receptor CD4 on target cells to initiate infection. Env is a heterodimer of a transmembrane glycoprotein (gp41) and a surface glycoprotein (gp120), and forms trimers on the surface of the viral membrane. Using cryo-electron tomography combined with three-dimensional image classification and averaging, we report the three-dimensional structures of trimeric Env displayed on native HIV-1 in the unliganded state, in complex with the broadly neutralizing antibody b12 and in a ternary complex with CD4 and the 17b antibody. By fitting the known crystal structures of the monomeric gp120 core in the b12- and CD4/17b-bound conformations into the density maps derived by electron tomography, we derive molecular models for the native HIV-1 gp120 trimer in unliganded and CD4-bound states. We demonstrate that CD4 binding results in a major reorganization of the Env trimer, causing an outward rotation and displacement of each gp120 monomer. This appears to be coupled with a rearrangement of the gp41 region along the central axis of the trimer, leading to closer contact between the viral and target cell membranes. Our findings elucidate the structure and conformational changes of trimeric HIV-1 gp120 relevant to antibody neutralization and attachment to target cells."
https://openalex.org/W1988803699,"The gut-derived hormone ghrelin exerts its effect on the brain by regulating neuronal activity. Ghrelin-induced feeding behaviour is controlled by arcuate nucleus neurons that co-express neuropeptide Y and agouti-related protein (NPY/AgRP neurons). However, the intracellular mechanisms triggered by ghrelin to alter NPY/AgRP neuronal activity are poorly understood. Here we show that ghrelin initiates robust changes in hypothalamic mitochondrial respiration in mice that are dependent on uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). Activation of this mitochondrial mechanism is critical for ghrelin-induced mitochondrial proliferation and electric activation of NPY/AgRP neurons, for ghrelin-triggered synaptic plasticity of pro-opiomelanocortin-expressing neurons, and for ghrelin-induced food intake. The UCP2-dependent action of ghrelin on NPY/AgRP neurons is driven by a hypothalamic fatty acid oxidation pathway involving AMPK, CPT1 and free radicals that are scavenged by UCP2. These results reveal a signalling modality connecting mitochondria-mediated effects of G-protein-coupled receptors on neuronal function and associated behaviour. The gut-derived hormone ghrelin stimulates food intake by regulating the neuropeptide Y/agouti-related protein (NPY/AgRP) neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. How it does that was unclear, but studies in mice now show the ghrelin-induced increase in appetite is driven by burning fat in hypothalamic mitochondria, which produces free radicals that are scavenged by the mitochondrial protein UCP2 (uncoupling protein 2). This raises the possibility that free radicals are involved in regulating appetite control, and that interventions that interfere with free radicals may have an effect on eating and satiety. Ghrelin stimulates food uptake by bringing about changes in mitochondrial respiration and proliferation, which are essential for activation of NPY/AgRP neurons. The effects of ghrelin are dependent on the presence of UCP2."

However, the application of plant barcoding has been constrained by a lack of consensus regarding the most variable and technically practical DNA region(s). We compared eight candidate plant barcoding regions from the plastome and one from the mitochondrial genome for how well they discriminated the monophyly of 92 species in 32 diverse genera of land plants (N = 251 samples). The plastid markers comprise portions of five coding (rpoB, rpoC1, rbcL, matK and 23S rDNA) and three non-coding (trnH-psbA, atpF–atpH, and psbK–psbI) loci. Our survey included several taxonomically complex groups, and in all cases we examined multiple populations and species. The regions differed in their ability to discriminate species, and in ease of retrieval, in terms of amplification and sequencing success. Single locus resolution ranged from 7% (23S rDNA) to 59% (trnH-psbA) of species with well-supported monophyly. Sequence recovery rates were related primarily to amplification success (85–100% for plastid loci), with matK requiring the greatest effort to achieve reasonable recovery (88% using 10 primer pairs). Several loci (matK, psbK–psbI, trnH-psbA) were problematic for generating fully bidirectional sequences. Setting aside technical issues related to amplification and sequencing, combining the more variable plastid markers provided clear benefits for resolving species, although with diminishing returns, as all combinations assessed using four to seven regions had only marginally different success rates (69–71%; values that were approached by several two- and three-region combinations). This performance plateau may indicate fundamental upper limits on the precision of species discrimination that is possible with DNA barcoding systems that include moderate numbers of plastid markers. Resolution to the contentious debate on plant barcoding should therefore involve increased attention to practical issues related to the ease of sequence recovery, global alignability, and marker redundancy in multilocus plant DNA barcoding systems."
https://openalex.org/W2081358044,"The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) plays a key role in cell death, yet its molecular identity remains uncertain. Although knock-out studies have confirmed critical roles for both cyclophilin-D (CyP-D) and the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), given a strong enough stimulus MPTP opening can occur in the absence of either. Here we provide evidence that the mitochondrial phosphate carrier (PiC) may also be a critical component of the MPTP. Phenylarsine oxide (PAO) was found to activate MPTP opening in the presence of carboxyatractyloside (CAT) that prevents ANT binding to immobilized PAO. Only four proteins from solubilized CAT-treated beef heart inner mitochondrial membranes bound to immobilized PAO, one of which was the PiC. GST-CyP-D pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed CsA-sensitive binding of PiC to CyP-D; this increased following diamide treatment. Co-immunoprecipitation of the ANT with the PiC was also observed but was insensitive to CsA treatment. N-ethylmaleimide and ubiquinone analogues (UQ0 and Ro 68-3400) inhibited phosphate transport into rat liver mitochondria with the same concentration dependence as their inhibition of MPTP opening. UQ0 and Ro 68-3400 also induced the “m” conformation of the ANT, as does NEM, and reduced the binding of both the PiC and ANT to the PAO column. We propose a model for the MPTP in which a calcium-triggered conformational change of the PiC, facilitated by CyP-D, induces pore opening. An interaction of the PiC with the ANT may enable agents that bind to either transporter to modulate pore opening.

Opening is greatly enhanced by adenine nucleotide depletion, elevated phosphate, and oxidative stress, conditions known to accompany exposure to some toxins and reperfusion following a period of ischemia (1Halestrap A.P.

Indeed, the opening of the MPTP is now recognized as a major cause of the necrotic cell death occurring under such conditions and inhibiting MPTP opening with drugs such as cyclosporin A analogues, and Sanglifehrin A offers substantial protection (4Bernardi P.

In view of its critical role in cell death, it is important to understand the molecular mechanism of the MPTP. A widely held model places the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) as the pore-forming component in the inner mitochondrial membrane with the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity of cyclophilin-D (CyP-D), facilitating a calcium-induced conformational change (2Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar, 3Halestrap A.P. McStay G.P. Clarke S.J.

This model was initially proposed by us largely on the basis of the effects of known ligands of CyP-D and the ANT (9Halestrap A.P. Davidson A.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Cyclosporin A (CsA), first shown to inhibit pore opening by Crompton et al. (10Crompton M. Ellinger H. Costi A. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 357-360PubMed Google Scholar), was the key to identifying the role for CyP-D, and we subsequently showed that the potency of several CsA analogues as inhibitors of the pore correlated with their ability to inhibit the activity of a matrix peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) (11Griffiths E.J. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The importance of this protein has now been confirmed by the demonstration that mitochondria from CyP-D knock-out mice do not exhibit CsA-sensitive MPTP opening (12Basso E. Fante L. Fowlkes J.

A role for the ANT in MPTP formation was implied by the observation that pore opening is enhanced by agents such as carboxyatractyloside (CAT) that induce the “c” conformation of the ANT and inhibited by agents such as bongkrekic acid (BKA) that enhance the “m” conformation (9Halestrap A.P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3346-3354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). In addition, the ability of nucleotides to inhibit pore opening correlates with their ability to act as substrates for the ANT (17Halestrap A.P. Woodfield K.Y. Connern C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3346-3354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Furthermore, oxidative stress can modify a matrix cysteine on the ANT (Cys160 in rat ANT1) preventing adenine nucleotide binding and so accounting for the sensitization of the MPTP to calcium by oxidative stress (17Halestrap A.P. Woodfield K.Y. Connern C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3346-3354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 18McStay G.P. Clarke S.J. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). More direct evidence was obtained by the demonstration by us and others that the ANT binds tightly to GST-CyP-D (19Woodfield K. Ruck A. Brdiczka D. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 20Crompton M. Virji S. Ward J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Finally, the purified and reconstituted adenine nucleotide translocase of Neurospora crassa can form nonspecific channels at high calcium concentrations (21Brustovetsky N. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8483-8488Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), and the opening probability of these pores is increased at high membrane potential by the presence of cyclophilin from Neurospora crassa (22Brustovetsky N. Tropschug M. Heimpel S. Heidkamper D. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11804-11811Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Despite the strong evidence summarized above, an absolute requirement for the ANT in MPTP formation is unlikely because liver mitochondria of mice genetically modified to lack the two major isoforms of ANT (ANT1 and ANT2) still exhibit CsA-inhibitable MPTP opening (23Kokoszka J.E. Waymire K.G. Levy S.E. Sligh J.E. Cal J.Y. Jones D.P. MacGregor G.R. Wallace D.C. Nature. 2004; 427: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). It should be noted that although these mitochondria show very little ANT activity, they do contain ANT4 (24Da Cruz S. Xenarios I. Langridge J. Vilbois F. Parone P.A. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41566-41571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), which probably explains how the animals survive (6Halestrap A.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 25Halestrap A.P. Nature. 2004; (1p following 983 PMID: 15332302): 430PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless the MPTP of the ANT-deficient mitochondria is no longer sensitive to ligands of the ANT and requires much higher calcium concentrations to open. These data are most easily interpreted in one of two ways. Either the ANT is not the major pore-forming component of the MPTP, but rather plays a regulatory role, or the ANT is the normal pore-forming component, but in its absence, other membrane transporters present in the IMM at much lower concentrations may fulfill the same role (6Halestrap A.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). An alternative possibility has been suggested by He and Lemasters (27He L.H. Lemasters J.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) in which the MPTP forms as a result of aggregation of misfolded integral membrane proteins damaged by oxidant and other stresses. CyP-D blocks conductance through these protein aggregates, but when protein clusters exceed CyP-D, unregulated pore opening occurs that is stimulated by calcium and inhibited by CsA binding to CyP-D. Because the ANT is the most abundant protein in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is susceptible to oxidative damage, this may account for its apparent involvement in MPTP formation. However, the activation and inhibition of MPTP opening by CAT and BKA, respectively, argue against such a nonspecific effect because both ligands stabilize the ANT (8Halestrap A.P. Brenner C. Curr. Med. Chem. 2003; 10: 1507-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that the mitochondrial phosphate carrier (PiC) can associate with the ANT and binds to CyP-D in a CsA-sensitive manner. We also show that phenylarsine oxide (PAO), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and ubiquinone analogues, all known modulators of MPTP opening, can bind to both proteins. Our current results, taken together with published data, are consistent with a model for the MPTP in which the pore formation involves a calcium-triggered, CyP-D-facilitated conformational change of the PiC that is modulated by the conformational state of a closely associated ANT molecule. Materials—All reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Ro 68-3400 was a kind gift of Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland. Monoclonal antibodies against CyP-D and ANT1 were obtained from Mitoscience (Eugene, Oregon 97403), while rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the C terminus of the ANT and the whole ANT were those we raised previously (18McStay G.P. Clarke S.J. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 19Woodfield K. Ruck A. Brdiczka D. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against the PiC was raised commercially (Sigma-Genosys) using the C-terminal 11 amino acids (ESLKKKLGLTE) conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) was obtained from Abcam (Cambridge CB4 0FW, UK). Preparation of Mitochondria—Mitochondria were prepared from rat heart and liver following homogenization in sucrose isolation buffer (ISA; 300 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) using a Polytron PT10 (heart) or Dounce Potter (liver) homogenizer, and purified by Percoll gradient centrifugation as described previously (28Hughes W.A. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1981; 196: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 29Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For preparation of beef heart mitochondria, fresh hearts were collected from the abattoir, stored on ice during transit for 30 min and then, following removal of connective tissues, fats, and coagulated blood, cut into small pieces (∼25 g) and washed in sucrose isolation buffer. Homogenization was achieved using a meat grinder with plate holes of 4 mm followed by a Waring blender as described elsewhere (30Smith A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 81-86Crossref Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The pH of the final homogenate was adjusted to pH 7.4 with Tris base. Isolation Buffer B (ISB; ISA + 0.5% (w/v) BSA) was added to the homogenate (500 ml of ISB/liter homogenate), and the mixture was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was decanted through a double layer of cheese cloth and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min. Subsequent steps were performed as described for rat heart mitochondria. Mitochondrial protein concentration was determined by Biuret assay using BSA as a standard (31Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. David M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MPTP Opening and Mitochondrial Phosphate Transport: Swelling Assays—For routine measurement of MPTP opening mitochondrial swelling (decrease in A520) was measured under de-energized conditions at 25 °C in KSCN buffer (150 mm KSCN, 20 mm MOPS, 10 mm Tris, 0.5 μm rotenone, 0.5 μm antimycin; pH 7.2) containing 2 mm nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) and 2 μm A23187 (9Halestrap A.P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3346-3354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Swelling was initiated by addition of 1.4 mm CaCl2 (180 μm free [Ca2+]). For comparison of the sensitivity of MPTP opening and phosphate transport to inhibitors, KCl buffer was employed (125 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS, 10 mm Tris, 0.5 μm rotenone, 0.5 μm antimycin pH 7.2) and was supplemented with 2 mm NTA, 2 μm A23187, and 20 mm NaPi. For measurement of phosphate transport, the KCl buffer was supplemented with 0.5 mm EGTA, 4 μm nigericin, and, unless otherwise stated, 0.5 μm cyclosporin-A (CsA). Ubiquinone analogues were added at the required concentration to the KCl buffer, whereas for NEM treatment, mitochondria (40 mg/ml) were pretreated in isolation buffer (ISA) at 0 °C for 2 min with the required NEM concentration prior to dilution into the assay buffer. Following addition of mitochondria (7 mg of protein) to 7 ml of assay buffer, aliquots (3.5 ml) were incubated at 25 °C (MPTP assay) or 6 °C in the sample and reference cuvettes of a split-beam spectrophotometer for 5 min. The assay was then initiated by the addition of either 70 μl of 2 m NaPi (pH 7.2 neutralized with Tris) for phosphate transport or 16 μl of 0.2 m CaCl (final free [Ca2+] 45 μm) for MPTP opening. A520 was monitored continuously with on-line data acquisition at 10 or 2 data points per second, respectively. Shrinkage of Preswollen Mitochondria—The sensitivity of the MPTP to inhibition by ADP was determined by the shrinkage of preswollen mitochondria (increase in A520) upon addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG-2000) as described previously (17Halestrap A.P.

Mitochondria were preswollen by incubating for 20 min at 2 mg/ml and 30 °C in KSCN buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 and where required CAT and PAO. Swelling was terminated by the addition of 1.2 mm EGTA and centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min to pellet the swollen mitochondria, which were then resuspended at 20 mg/ml in KSCN buffer containing 2 mm NTA and 2 μm A23187. Preswollen mitochondria (1 mg) were incubated in the sample cuvette of the split-beam spectrophotometer at 25 °C in 3 ml of KSCN buffer supplemented with 2 mm NTA, 2 μm A23187, and the required concentration of Ca2+ and ADP. After 1 min, shrinkage was initiated by the rapid addition of 0.5 ml of 50% (w/v) PEG 2000 to the sample cuvette through the injection port followed by vigorous mixing with an overhead stirrer. A520 was monitored continuously (10 data points/second). ANT Conformational Changes—Changes in light-scattering (A520) of energized beef heart mitochondria were detected upon addition of ligands of the ANT and submicromolar [Ca2+]. These light-scattering changes occur in the absence of any change in mitochondrial volume and reflect conformational changes of the ANT (29Halestrap A.P. Biochem.

The beads were washed five times with 1 ml of PCB. Bound protein was then eluted by incubation of beads in 100 μl of PCB containing 10 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation, and the protein concentration of the eluted supernatant determined by Bradford assay prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.FIGURE 2Pretreatment of mitochondria with CAT and BKA do not prevent activation of MPTP opening by PAO.

Immunoprecipitation—Isolated rat liver or heart mitochondria were pretreated as required for 10 min at 2 mg/ml and room temperature in IP Buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm MOPS, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2) containing protease inhibitors (pepstatin, leupeptin, and antipain at 4 μg/ml, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and benzamidine at 0.5 mm) prior to solubilization for 15 min at 1 mg/ml and 4 °C in IP buffer containing 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100. Insoluble material was collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min, and the solubilized proteins incubated with 4 μl of the required antibody at 4 °C with constant rotation for 90 min. Protein A-Sepharose (18 μl of 50% slurry) was preswollen in water for 15 min and washed three times in IP Buffer containing 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 prior to adding to the protein/antibody mix and tumbling at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein A-Sepharose with the attached immunocomplexes was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 s and washed three times in a 1-ml volume of IP buffer containing 3% (w/v) Triton X-100 to remove any nonspecifically bound proteins.

For ADP-stimulated respiration, the buffer was supplemented with 1 mm ADP and respiration substrates, either 5 mm l-glutamate + 2 mm l-malate or 5 mm succinate + 0.5 μm rotenone. For uncoupled respiration, the buffer was supplemented with 1 μm oligomycin and 40 nm FCCP, a concentration demonstrated to give maximal respiration with both substrates.

https://openalex.org/W2136498480,"Natural selection dictates that cells constantly adapt to dynamically changing environments in a context-dependent manner. Gene-regulatory networks often mediate the cellular response to perturbation, and an understanding of cellular adaptation will require experimental approaches aimed at subjecting cells to a dynamic environment that mimics their natural habitat. Here we monitor the response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolic gene regulation to periodic changes in the external carbon source by using a microfluidic platform that allows precise, dynamic control over environmental conditions. We show that the metabolic system acts as a low-pass filter that reliably responds to a slowly changing environment, while effectively ignoring fast fluctuations. The sensitive low-frequency response was significantly faster than in predictions arising from our computational modelling, and this discrepancy was resolved by the discovery that two key galactose transcripts possess half-lives that depend on the carbon source. Finally, to explore how induction characteristics affect frequency response, we compare two S. cerevisiae strains and show that they have the same frequency response despite having markedly different induction properties. This suggests that although certain characteristics of the complex networks may differ when probed in a static environment, the system has been optimized for a robust response to a dynamically changing environment."

AGEs are a heterogeneous group of structures, including carboxymethyllysine (CML), carboxyethyllysine (CEL), and hydroimidazolone protein adducts that are formed at enhanced rates at sites of inflammation in renal failure, under conditions of hyperglycemia, and under conditions associated with systemic and local oxidant stress (8.Brownlee M.

Unlike AGEs and possibly amphoterin, which bind to a single domain, all three extracellular domains of RAGE are involved in binding S100 proteins; S100A12 binds to the C1 domain (14.Xie J. Burz D.S.

These differences in RAGE binding sites may account for the diverse cellular responses caused by S100 proteins. Two glycosylation sites were identified in RAGE (17.Srikrishna G. Huttunen H.J. Johansson L. Weigle B. Yamaguchi Y. Rauvala H. Freeze H.H. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Glycosylation at the V domain site significantly increases RAGE affinity for amphoterin, presumably due to the amphoterin binding affinity for carboxylated glycans. At the same time, de-glycosylation as well as G82S polymorphism in the V domain increases RAGE affinity for specific AGEs (18.Hofmann M.A. Drury S. Hudson B.I. Gleason M.R. Qu W. Lu Y. Lalla E.

Yan S.D. Yan S.F. Stern D.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). This protein can scavenge RAGE ligands, thus preventing them from binding to RAGE and/or other surface cell receptors. sRAGE serves as a decoy rather than a selective RAGE blocker and may have wider therapeutic potential than RAGE. sRAGE administered to diabetic mice significantly suppressed accelerated athero-sclerosis, which is a hallmark of inflammation (21.Kislinger T.

Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The structural diversity of RAGE ligands and the fact that RAGE recognizes a class of ligands such as AGEs led to the hypothesis that RAGE is a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) (5.Liliensiek B. Weigand M.A. Bierhaus A. Nicklas W. Kasper M. Hofer S. Plachky J. Grone H.J. Kurschus F.C. Schmidt A.M. Yan S.D. Martin E. Schleicher E. Stern D.M. Hammerling G.G. Nawroth P.P. Arnold B. J. Clin.

The concept of pattern recognition was introduced to describe innate immunity receptors, such as the Toll and mannose receptors, which recognize conserved molecular structures shared by a large group of pathogens (23.Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 295-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). Such conserved patterns can be a carbohydrate moiety on the pathogen cell wall or a viral double-stranded RNA. The mannose receptor, one of the most extensively studied PRRs, serves as a paradigm of this class of receptors (24.Stahl P.D. Ezekowitz R.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) and has the following features common to all PRRs: 1) a multidomain structure, 2) repeats of structurally similar subunits, 3) the ability to recognize different classes of ligands (proteins, carbohydrate chains, etc.), confined to specialized domains, and 4) in the case of polysaccharide binding, binding affinity of monomeric units is weak and increases with increasing polymer chain length (25.Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 399-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Features 1 and 3 are present in RAGE. However, RAGE does not have repeats of structurally similar domains, which allows PRRs to recognize patterned ligands. Unlike PRRs of the innate system that predominantly bind exogenous ligands, all known RAGE ligands are endogenous. RAGE binding affinity for AGEs strongly depends on the degree of glycation of the ligand. Paradoxically, free glycated amino acids, CML and CEL, do not bind to RAGE, although various AGE-modified proteins bind to RAGE with nanomolar affinity (7.Kislinger T. Fu C. Huber B. Qu W. Taguchi A.

Here we present a series of experiments that are designed to elucidate the mechanism of RAGE-AGEs binding and show how RAGE functions as a PRR. Using fluorescence resonance transfer (FRET), we showed that expressed RAGE oligomerizes on the plasma membrane of human cells. Using high resolution NMR, we constructed a structural model of the AGE binding V-domain of RAGE. We identified the interaction surfaces used by RAGE to bind different classes of AGEs. We also determined the influence of the G82S mutation of RAGE on its structure and the binding affinity for AGEs. These experiments allowed us to propose a consistent mechanism of RAGE-AGEs structural interactions that can shed light on the complex nature of RAGE signaling in the cell. Reagents and Chemicals—Restriction enzymes and Taq polymerase were from New England Biolabs. Nϵ-(carboxymethyl)-l-lysine and Nϵ-(carboxyethyl)-l-lysine (mixture of two diastereoisomers) were from NeoMPS, Inc. (purity > 95%). All other chemicals used were reagent grade or better. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells from the American Type Culture Collection were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%), penicillin (5 μg/ml), and streptomycin (5 μg/ml), all from Invitrogen. Cells were maintained at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and Opti-MEM media (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's guidelines. Cells were routinely incubated with transfection mixtures overnight, medium was exchanged to modified Eagle's medium without phenol red (Invitrogen), and cells were imaged live within the next 5-30 h. Plasmid Construction and cDNAs—Human RAGE cDNA library clone BC020669 was obtained from Open Biosystems and used as a template for PCR amplifications. Clontech vectors containing genes for cyan fluorescent protein (pCFP-N1) and yellow fluorescent protein (pYFP-N1) were mutated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis II-E kit (Stratagene) to introduce an A206K substitution in both CFP and YFP, which eliminates the tendency of CFP and YFP to dimerize at high concentrations (26.Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). We called these mutants mCFP and mYFP, where “m” denoted monomeric versions of the proteins. hRAGE cDNA was cloned in-frame into modified vectors upstream of the fluorescent protein sequence to obtain hRAGE-mCFP and hRAGE-mYFP constructs. DNA coding for the V domain (amino acids 24-125) and C1C2 domains (amino acids 114-334) were PCR-amplified from cDNA library clone BC020669 (Open Biosystems) using Taq polymerase and oligo-nucleotides containing flanking 5′-NdeI and 3′-SalI restriction sites. The restriction-digested PCR products were ligated into the NdeI and SalI sites of expression vector pET28a (Novagen), which confers kanamycin resistance. The resulting plasmids pET28V and pET28C1C2 express cleavable, C-terminal His-tagged proteins. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis II-E kit (Stratagene) was used to introduce a G82S substitution into the V domain. Confocal Microscopy and FRET Assay—HEK293 cells were plated on 35-mm dishes with polylysine-coated glass coverslip windows (MatTek) and grown to 90% confluency before transfecting with hRAGE/mCFP (donor) or hRAGE/mYFP (acceptor) plasmids or with both simultaneously at a donor/acceptor ratio of 1:2. Invitrogen recommendations on the cell to DNA ratio for Lipofectamine transfections were used as guidelines. Live imaging of the cells was performed at room temperature in modified Eagle's medium (w/o phenol red) using a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal imaging system equipped with a 30-milli-watt argon laser and a ×63, 1.4 NA oil immersion objective. Cells displaying similar levels of labeling throughout the plasma membrane were selected for FRET experiments. FRET was measured by acceptor photobleaching (27.Bastiaens P.I. Majoul I.V. Verveer P.J. Soling H.D. Jovin T.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4246-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 28.Herrick-Davis K. Grinde E. Harrigan T.J. Mazurkiewicz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40144-40151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). An optical slice about 2-μm through the middle of HEK293 cells expressing both mCFP and mYFP-labeled RAGE was visualized with a confocal microscope, and a small rectangular region of plasma membrane was selected for photobleaching. Time series mode was used to acquire a series of images at discrete wavelengths (λ-stacks). Images in 12 different channels from 464 to 700 nm were recorded simultaneously after excitation at 458 nm (10% laser intensity was used to minimize donor photobleaching). After collecting 2-3 pre-bleach λ-stacks, selected regions were bleached using a 514-nm laser line (100% intensity, 60 iterations using a 458/514-nm dual dichroic mirror) effectively decreasing YFP fluorescence to 5-15% that of the pre-bleach levels. Several post-bleach images were collected immediately after photobleaching. For linear unmixing of emission spectra in cotransfected cells, reference spectra of CFP and YFP were collected from cells expressing hRAGE-mCFP or hRAGE-mYFP alone after excitation at 458 nm. Unmixing was facilitated by the use of a Zeiss META detector and the linear unmixing function of the LSM 510 META. Quantitatively, FRET was measured as an increase in CFP fluorescence intensity (donor dequenching) after YFP (acceptor) photobleaching. The FRET macro in the Zeiss AIM software package was used for calculations, taking into account CFP and YFP background noise in each channel. FRET efficiencies were also calculated in cells expressing hRAGE-mCFP alone and in non-bleached regions of the cell membrane as a control. Labeling, Expression, and Purification of the V Domain—To uniformly label the V domain of RAGE, pET28V and pET28V-G82S were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) Codon+ (Novagen). For U-15N labeling, cells were grown at 37 °C in minimal medium (M9) containing 35 mg/liter kanamycin and 1 g/liter [15N]ammonium chloride as the sole nitrogen source. For U-13C,15N labeling, cells were grown at 37 °C in M9 medium containing 35 mg/liter kanamycin, 1 g/liter [15N]ammonium chloride, and 2 g/liter [13C]glucose instead of unlabeled glucose as the sole carbon source. Cells were grown to ∼0.7 A600 at 37 °C, induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and grown overnight. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, containing 8 m urea and heat lysed at 100 °C for 10 min. The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotri-acetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). The column was washed with 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, containing 8 m urea, and the protein was allowed to re-nature in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, on the column before eluting with 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, containing 500 mm imidazole. Fractions containing the eluted protein were pooled and dialyzed into NMR buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3). The C-terminal His tag of the V domain was cut by thrombin (Novagen) at room temperature for 1 h before gel filtration chromatography on a S.E.-75 column (Amersham Biosciences). The fractions containing the eluted protein were concentrated to 50-500 μm by using Ultra-Centricones (Millipore). Purity was estimated to be >95% by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE. Preparation of Fructosyllysine (FL) Peptides—Two model peptides containing Nϵ-(1-deoxy-d-fructos-1-yl)-lysine (K*), AK*ASASFL and ALK*AWSVAR, were synthesized on solid support using Fmoc chemistry following the protocol described in Frolov et al. (29.Frolov A. Singer D. Hoffmann R. J. Pept. Sci. 2007; 13: 862-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Preparation of CML-Peptide—A model peptide, containing CML, DEF-CML-ADE was synthesized on solid support using Fmoc chemistry following the protocol described in Gruber and Hofmann (30.Gruber P. Hofmann T. J. Pept. Res. 2005; 66: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The presence of the CML modification in the peptide was confirmed by using homonuclear two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy and total correlation spectroscopy NMR experiments (31.Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 613-655Google Scholar). We assigned the chemical shifts of the carboxymethyl protons in the DEF-CML-ADE peptide dissolved in D2O to be 3.92 ppm. Preparation of CML-Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA)—We followed the protocol developed in Buetler et al. (32.Buetler T.M. Leclerc E. Baumeyer A. Latado H. Newell J. Adolfsson O. Parisod V. Richoz J. Maurer S. Foata F. Piguet D. Junod S. Heizmann C.W. Delatour T. Mol. Nutr. Food Res. 2008; 52: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) that leads exclusively to CML modifications of lysine. Briefly, CML-BSA was prepared by incubating 5 mm BSA (fraction V, fatty acid-free, endotoxin free bovine serum albumin, EMD, Gibbstown, NJ) in 150 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 25 mm glyoxylic acid and 75 mm NaBH3CN at 50 °C for 48 h. The reaction mixture was dialyzed against 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 100 mm NaCl to remove unreacted glyoxylic acid and NaBH3CN. To obtain trypsin-digested CML-BSA (trypsin-CML-BSA), 2 mm CML-BSA was incubated with 1 ml of the settled agarose gel of immobilized trypsin (Pierce) in 0.1 m NH4HCO3 buffer, pH 8.0, for 18 h at 37 °C. Immobilized trypsin was removed from the digestion mixture by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. The solution of digested AGE-BSA was dialyzed against 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm NaCl using dialysis tubing with 1-kDa molecular mass cut-off (Spectrapor, Inc). After adding 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (GBT, Inc.) to inhibit the residual trypsin activity, the sample of digested AGE-BSA was used in the NMR titration experiments. Preparation of Fruc-AGE-BSA and HOCl-BSA—Fruc-AGE-BSA was prepared as described in Valencia et al. (33.Valencia J.V. Weldon S.C. Quinn D. Kiers G.H. DeGroot J. TeKoppele J.M. Hughes T.E. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 324: 68-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 mm BSA was incubated in 400 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mm EDTA containing 0.5 m d-(-)-fructose as modifier for 1, 3, 6, and 12 weeks at 37 °C under sterile conditions, thus creating Fruc-AGE-BSA-1w, Fruc-AGE-BSA-3w, Fruc-AGE-BSA-6w, and Fruc-AGE-BSA-12w samples, respectively. HOCl-BSA was freshly prepared by incubating BSA with HOCl (oxidant:protein molar ratio of 100:1) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, for 1 h at 4 °C (34.Marsche G. Semlitsch M. Hammer A. Frank S. Weigle B. Demling N. Schmidt K. Windischhofer W. Waeg G. Sattler W. Malle E. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Low molecular weight reactants were removed by using a PD-10 column and dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline. The resultant AGE preparations were passed through a 0.22-μm filter (Millipore) to remove small particulates. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford assay (Pierce) according to the supplier's protocol. The extent of modification of lysyl and arginyl residues in the AGE preparations was determined using fluorescamine and 9, 10-phenanthrenequinone fluorescence-based assays(35.Schmitt A. Schmitt J. Munch G. Gasic-Milencovic J. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 338: 201-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The lysyl residues in 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-week Fruc-AGE-BSA preparations were estimated to be modified to 46 ± 2, 50 ± 1, 52 ± 2, and 62 ± 3%, respectively. The arginyl residues in the 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-week Fruc-AGE-BSA preparations were estimated to be modified to 5 ± 1, 7 ± 1, 12 ± 2, and 24 ± 2%, respectively. These values are consistent with the free amine content of Fruc-AGE-BSA reported by Valencia et al. (33.Valencia J.V. Weldon S.C. Quinn D. Kiers G.H. DeGroot J. TeKoppele J.M. Hughes T.E. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 324: 68-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The lysyl and arginyl residues in HOCl-BSA preparation were estimated to be modified to 82 ± 3 and 53 ± 1%, respectively. AGE-BSA Pulldown Assay—10 μl of 10 μm His-tagged V domain of RAGE in 10 μl of binding buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl) were mixed with 20 μl of His-tag beads (Amersham Biosciences) and equilibrated in binding buffer. 10 μl of 10 μm His-tagged C1C2 domain in binding buffer were mixed with 20 μl of His-tag beads equilibrated in binding buffer. 30 μl of 100 μm Fruc-AGE-BSA in binding buffer were added to the beads. The mix was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min followed by 3 buffer washes. The protein absorbed on the His-tag beads was analyzed using 12% Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE. NMR Experiments—Protein samples of the [U- 13C,15N] and [U-15N]V domain, with concentrations ranging from 60 to 100 μm were dissolved in NMR buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, 90%/10% H2O/D2O). The U-15N G82S V domain was dissolved in the same NMR buffer at a concentration of 30 μm. Standard triple resonance spectra 1H{15N}-HSQC, HN(CA)CO, HNCO, HN(CO)CA, HNCA, CBCA(CO)NH, and HNCACB (31.Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 613-655Google Scholar) were acquired at 298 K using an Avance Bruker spectrometer operating at a 1H frequency of 700 MHz equipped with a single Z-axis gradient cryoprobe. All spectra were processed using TOPSPIN 2.1 (Bruker, Inc), and assignments were made using CARA (36.Masse J.E. Keller R. J. Magn. Reson. 2005; 174: 133-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To study V domain-AGEs interactions, NMR titration experiments were performed. 1 mm unlabeled fructosyllysine-peptides, CML-peptide, CML-BSA, trypsin-CML-BSA, Fruc-AGE-BSA, or HOCl-BSA proteins in NMR buffer were titrated into 50 μm U-15N-labeled V domain in 6 steps to yield V domain to AGE-BSA molar ratios of 5:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:5, and 1:10, respectively. The results of the titration were monitored by 1H{15N}-HSQC. Over the course of titration, the signal to noise ratio of the peaks that did not show any changes was kept constant by adjusting the number of scans. The same set of NMR titration experiments with Fruc-AGE-BSA was repeated using the U-15N-labeled G82S V domain sample. Unmodified peptides, AKASASFL, ALKAWSVAR, and DEFKADE, and BSA were used as negative controls during titration experiments. No changes in the 1H{15N}-HSQC spectra of 50 μm U-15N-labeled V domain or 30 μm U-15N-labeled G82S V domain were observed up"

However, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying this migratory process. Here we show by wound-healing assays that Ror2 plays critical roles in Wnt5a-induced cell migration by regulating formation of lamellipodia and reorientation of microtubule-organizing center (MTOC). Wnt5a stimulation induces activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase JNK at the wound edge in a Ror2-dependent manner, and inhibiting JNK activity abrogates Wnt5a-induced lamellipodia formation and MTOC reorientation. Additionally, the association of Ror2 with the actin-binding protein filamin A is required for Wnt5a-induced JNK activation and polarized cell migration. We further show that Wnt5a-induced JNK activation and MTOC reorientation can be suppressed by inhibiting PKCζ. Taken together, our findings indicate that Wnt5a/Ror2 activates JNK, through a process involving filamin A and PKCζ, to regulate polarized cell migration.

Loss- or gain-of-function analyses in mice, Xenopus laevis and Caenorhabditis elegans reveal that, like Wnt5a, Ror2 and/or Ror2 orthologs are required for convergent extension movements and for polarity and migration of several cell types during development (4Oishi I.

Ohta Y. Takada S. Kikuchi A. Minami Y. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, it remains largely unknown how Ror2 and FLNa function in Wnt5a-induced cell migration and whether JNK is involved in this process. Polarized cell migration is essential for development and wound-healing and requires rearrangements of microtubule (MT) and actin cytoskeletons (14Kodama A. Lechler T. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Franz C.M. Jones G.E. Ridley A.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 153-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In directionally migrating cells in wounded monolayers of cultured cells (e.g. fibroblasts) following external stimuli (e.g. epidermal growth factor and lysophosphatidic acid), MT arrays and actin filaments become polarized facing to the wound edge. In such cells, selectively stabilized MTs (post-translationally detyrosinated tubulins or Glu tubulins) orient toward the leading edge and MT organizing center (MTOC) is reoriented to lie between the nucleus and the leading edge (16Gundersen G.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). At the leading edge, actin cytoskeletons are also reorganized to form lamellipodia, generating driving force for polarized migration (17Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3281) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been established that JNK is involved in wound-healing in Drosophila (18Ramet M. Lanot R. Zachary D. Manfruelli P. Dev. Biol. 2002; 241: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 19Bosch M. Serras F. Martin-Blanco E. Baguna J. Dev. Biol. 2005; 280: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Erk and p38 as well as JNK have also been implicated in cell migration during wound closure of fibroblastic and/or epithelial cells (20Matsubayashi Y. Ebisuya M. Honjoh S. Nishida E. Curr.

Onishi N. Takada R. Kani S. Ohkawara B. Koshida I. Suzuki K. Yamada G. Schwabe G.C. Mundlos S. Shibuya H. Takada S. Minami Y.

EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), its role in polarized cell migration remain elusive. Furthermore, it has recently been reported that Wnt5a-induced signaling pathway seems to cooperate with Par/aPKC pathway to mediate polarized reorganization of the microtubule cytoskeleton during a wound response (26Schlessinger K. McManus E.J. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), but it is unclear how JNK can interact functionally with components of the Par/aPKC pathway. We show by using in vitro wound-healing assays that Ror2 mediates polarized cell migration during Wnt5a-induced wound closure by regulating lamellipodia formation and MTOC reorientation in migrating cells at the wound edge. In fact, these cellular events can be impaired by suppressed expression of Ror2. Furthermore, JNK is activated at the wound edge, in a Ror2-dependent manner, following Wnt5a stimulation, and inhibiting JNK activity abrogates Wnt5a-induced lamellipodia formation and MTOC reorientation. We also show that FLNa and its interaction with Ror2 are required for Wnt5a-induced JNK activation and polarized cell migration. Moreover, we show that Wnt5a-induced JNK activation and MTOC reorientation can be suppressed by inhibiting PKCζ, suggesting a possible functional link between Wnt5a/Ror2/JNK and Par/aPKC pathways. Collectively, these results provide new insights into the mechanism by which Wnt5a/Ror2 regulates JNK activity, through a process involving FLNa and PKCζ, for polarized cell migration.

Conditioned media (CM) were harvested from confluent monolayers of Wnt5a/L or neo/L cells (30Takada R. Hijikata H. Kondoh H. Takada S. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) that had been cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The CM were diluted in FBS-free DMEM (2:5∼1:10) prior to use for cytoskeletal and cell motility analyses. Cell Culture, Retroviral Infection, Transfection, and Wounding—NIH3T3 and SaOS2 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS. M2 and A7 cells were maintained as described (31Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Packaging cell line Plat-A, provided by T. Kitamura, was maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma), and 10 μg/ml blasticidin (Sigma). Plat-A cells were transfected with retroviral plasmids using FuGENE 6 (Roche). After 48 h, viral supernatant was collected and filtered through 0.45-μm size pore. M2 cells were infected with the viral supernatant in the presence of 4 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma) for 24 h. After infection, M2 cells were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin, and single cell clones were isolated and screened for expression of Myc-FLNa (WT or Δ20) by immunoblot analysis. Two independent stable clones for each construct (clones 10 and 2 for WT and 3 and 7 for Δ20) were used. For siRNA transfection, we used GeneSilencer siRNA Transfection Reagent (Gene Therapy Systems) for NIH3T3 cells and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for SaOS2 cells. For wound-healing assays, cells were plated on fibronectin-coated coverslips in 12-well plates, grown to become confluent for 24 h, and scratched with a pipette tip once across the coverslip. The wounded cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated in the presence or absence of CM or purified Wnt5a. For immunoblot analyses, confluent cells on fibronectin-coated 35 mm dishes were scratched eight times across the dish, and immediately after wounding, cultured media were replaced with CM. The rate of wound closure was calculated by relative migrating distance between the wound edges. Immunoblotting, Cell Staining, and Image Analysis—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis as described (27Kani S. Oishi I. Yamamoto H. Yoda A. Suzuki H. Nomachi A. Iozumi K. Nishita M. Kikuchi A. Takumi T. Minami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50102-50109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For BrdU labeling, cells were incubated with 1 μm BrdU during the course of the wound-healing assay and stained with anti-BrdU antibody according to the manufacturer's instruction. For phalloidin staining, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin (Invitrogen) or Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin (Cambrex Bio Science). For immunostaining, cells were fixed at -20 °C in methanol. Fixed cells were stained with the respective antibodies as described (3Nishita M. Yoo S.K. Nomachi A. Kani S. Sougawa N. Ohta Y. Takada S. Kikuchi A. Minami Y. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Fluorescent images were obtained using a laser scanning confocal imaging system (LSM510, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) and processed using Photoshop CS (Adobe). Wnt5a Promotes Polarized Cell Migration in a Ror2-dependent Manner—When exposed to external stimuli that induce cell migration, cells become polarized by reorganizing microtubule and actin cytoskeletons, resulting in reorientation of MTOC and formation of an F-actin-rich membrane protrusion toward the direction of cell movement. Because Wnt5a is one of the stimuli that induces cell migration in various cell types, including fibroblasts (3Nishita M. Yoo S.K. Nomachi A. Kani S. Sougawa N. Ohta Y. Takada S. Kikuchi A. Minami Y. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 11Kurayoshi M. Oue N. Yamamoto H. Kishida M. Inoue A. Asahara T. Yasui W. Kikuchi A. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10439-10448Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 13Masckauchan T.N. Agalliu D. Vorontchikhina M. Ahn A. Parmalee N.L. Li C.M. Khoo A. Tycko B. Brown A.M. Kitajewski J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 5163-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), we examined whether or not Wnt5a could induce microtubule and actin rearrangements to regulate cell polarity by performing in vitro wound-healing assays. To this end, confluent monolayers of NIH3T3 cells, which express Ror2 endogenously, were treated with either control (neo) conditioned medium (CM) or Wnt5a CM. Because serum lipid, lysophosphatidic acid, is known to trigger MTOC reorientation after scratching the monolayers of NIH3T3 cells (32Palazzo A.F. Joseph H.L. Chen Y.J. Dujardin D.L. Alberts A.S. Pfister K.K. Vallee R.B. Gundersen G.G. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1536-1541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), we used CM with low serum concentration (0.5%), at which neo CM failed to induce significant MTOC reorientation after scratching (see Fig. 1D). In this condition, Wnt5a CM drastically promoted wound closure (migration of the wound edges), compared with neo CM (Fig. 1A). Labeling cells with BrdU during the course of wound-healing assay (16 h) revealed that the proportions of BrdU-positive cells were comparable between neo CM- and Wnt5a CM-treated cells (data not shown), suggesting that promoted cell migration rather than proliferation is attributable to Wnt5a-stimulated wound closure. Importantly, adding purified Wnt5a in cultured medium containing 1% FBS also significantly stimulated wound closure, albeit to a lesser extent compared with did Wnt5a CM (Fig. 1B). The difference in biological activities of Wnt5a CM and purified Wnt5a may be attributable to loss of Wnt5a activity during its purification and/or existence of a factor(s) in CM that potentiates activity of Wnt5a (33Yamamoto S. Nishimura O. Misaki K. Nishita M. Minami Y. Yonemura S. Tarui H. Sasaki H. Dev. Cell. 2008; 15: 23-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Phalloidin staining revealed that cells treated with Wnt5a CM, but not neo CM, exhibited formation of lamellipodial membrane protrusions at the edge of the wound (Fig. 1C), indicating that Wnt5a induces actin rearrangement to form lamellipodia, producing driving force for cell migration. We next examined whether Wnt5a stimulation can induce the reorientation of the MTOC in migrating cells at the wound edge. As mentioned above, under our experimental condition, neo CM failed to induce significant MTOC reorientation due to reduced serum concentration in the CM. In contrast, treatment of cells with Wnt5a CM (Fig. 1D), which contains the same concentration of serum as neo CM, or purified Wnt5a (data not shown) resulted in a drastic increase in cells with the reoriented MTOC, indicating that Wnt5a promotes MTOC reorientation. This finding is consistent with the result reported by Schlessinger et al. (26Schlessinger K. McManus E.J. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) showing that siRNA-mediated depletion of Wnt5a inhibited reorientation of centrosome and Golgi in rat embryo fibroblasts. Effect of Wnt5a on cell polarization was then examined by staining detyrosinated Glu tubulin, a reliable marker for stabilized MTs, in wound-edge cells, since MT stabilization is also a critical event to form and maintain polarized arrays of MTs during polarized cell migration (16Gundersen G.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1E, the percentage of Glu tubulin-positive cells at the wound edge were about 2-fold higher in Wnt5a CM-treated cells than in neo CM-treated cells, indicating that Wnt5a stimulation indeed promotes cell polarization. We have recently shown that Ror2 mediates Wnt5a-induced filopodia formation and cell migration through its association with filamin A (FLNa) (3Nishita M. Yoo S.K. Nomachi A. Kani S. Sougawa N. Ohta Y. Takada S. Kikuchi A. Minami Y. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), but it is still unknown whether Ror2 is involved in Wnt5a-induced cell polarization. To examine this issue, we knocked down Ror2 expression in NIH3T3 cells with two different siRNAs (Ror2 siRNA (1Yoda A. Oishi I. Minami Y. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 2003; 23: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and Ror2 siRNA (2Mikels A.J. Nusse R. PLoS. Biol. 2006; 4: e115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar), see “Experimental Procedures,” Fig. 2A). Suppression of Ror2 expression resulted in a drastic inhibition of Wnt5a CM- or purified Wnt5a-induced wound closure (Fig. 2, B and C), demonstrating a critical role of Ror2 in Wnt5a-induced wound closure. We then examined the effect of Ror2 gene knockdown on lamellipodia formation and MTOC reorientation in Wnt5a-stimulated cells. Ror2-depleted cells failed to exhibit lamellipodia formation following Wnt5a stimulation (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, Wnt5a-induced MTOC reorientation was impaired in Ror2-depleted cells (Fig. 2E). Similarly, suppressed expression of Ror2 in HeLa cells resulted in impaired MTOC reorientation following Wnt5a stimulation (data not shown). The results indicate that Ror2 plays critical roles in Wnt5a-induced polarized cell migration of NIH3T3 and HeLa cells. On the other hand, apparent differences in Wnt5a-induced wound closure and MTOC reorientation were not detectable in immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts from the wild-type and Ror2-/- embryos (data not shown). Further study will be required to elucidate molecular and/or cellular bases explaining this discrepancy. Wnt5a Induces JNK Activation at the Wound Edge in a Ror2-dependent Manner—We have previously shown that overexpression of Wnt5a and Ror2 in NIH3T3 cells resulted in an increase in kinase activity of JNK (4Oishi I. Suzuki H. Onishi N. Takada R. Kani S. Ohkawara B. Koshida I. Suzuki K. Yamada G. Schwabe G.C. Mundlos S. Shibuya H. Takada S. Minami Y. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that Wnt5a stimulation induces activation of JNK and ERK in NIH3T3 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, respectively (13Masckauchan T.N. Agalliu D. Vorontchikhina M. Ahn A. Parmalee N.L. Li C.M. Khoo A. Tycko B. Brown A.M. Kitajewski J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 5163-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 25Yamanaka H. Moriguchi T. Masuyama N. Kusakabe M. Hanafusa H. Takada R. Takada S. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). To examine if these MAP kinases are activated during Wnt5a-stimulated wound closure, we treated monolayers of NIH3T3 cells with either neo CM or Wnt5a CM after wounding and monitored their phosphorylation status by immunoblotting with phosphorylation site-specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3A, Wnt5a stimulation of wounded cells resulted in a drastic increase in the level of phosphorylated-JNK, but not -ERK and -p38, without altering their total amounts (Fig. 3A). The findings indicate that among MAP kinase family members, Wnt5a primarily induces activation of JNK in wounded fibroblasts. Although wounding by itself had a little effect on JNK phosphorylation, Wnt5a-induced JNK phosphorylation was markedly augmented after wounding (Fig. 3B), suggesting that wound stimuli can potentiate Wnt5a signaling to activate JNK. To verify this, Wnt5a-induced JNK activation in wounded monolayers was monitored by immunostaining using antibody against phosphorylated c-Jun at Ser-63, a well-established phosphorylation site in c-Jun by activated JNK. Interestingly, increased phosphorylation of c-Jun was detected predominantly in cells at the wound edge, following Wnt5a stimulation (Fig. 3C), indicating that Wnt5a-JNK pathway is activated predominantly in wound-edge cells. Consistent with our findings, Lallemand et al. (34Lallemand D. Ham J. Garbay S. Bakiri L. Traincard F. Jeannequin O. Pfarr C.M. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5615-5626Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) showed that although scratching the monolayers of NIH3T3 cells had little effect on c-Jun phosphorylation, stimulation of wounded monolayers with growth factors, such as EGF and PDGF, induced c-Jun phosphorylation in cells bordering the wound. Together, these results suggest that wounding the cell monolayers potentiates activation of JNK by external stimuli, including Wnt5a, in cells at the wound edge. In contrast, it has also been reported that scratching monolayers of human keratinocytes or mouse embryonic fibroblasts resulted in robust c-Jun phosphorylation in cells at the wound edge without additional external stimuli (24Jaeschke A. Karasarides M. Ventura J.J. Ehrhardt A. Zhang C. Flavell R.A. Shokat K.M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 899-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 34Lallemand D. Ham J. Garbay S. Bakiri L. Traincard F. Jeannequin O. Pfarr C.M. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5615-5626Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The discrepancy may reflect differences in cell types and/or experimental conditions used in these experiments. While it has previously been shown that overexpression of Ror2 and Wnt5a in NIH3T3 cells resulted in an increased kinase activity of JNK (4Oishi I. Suzuki H. Onishi N. Takada R. Kani S. Ohkawara B. Koshida I. Suzuki K. Yamada G. Schwabe G.C. Mundlos S. Shibuya H. Takada S. Minami Y. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), it remains unclear whether or not Ror2 is indeed required for Wnt5a-induced JNK activation. To clarify this issue, we examined the effect of Ror2 siRNA on Wnt5a-induced JNK activation in wounded monolayers of NIH3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, JNK phosphorylation induced by either Wnt5a CM (left panel) or purified Wnt5a (right panel) was remarkably inhibited in cells transfected with Ror2 siRNA (1Yoda A. Oishi I. Minami Y. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 2003; 23: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Essentially identical results were also obtained using Ror2 siRNA (2Mikels A.J. Nusse R. PLoS. Biol. 2006; 4: e115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar) (data not shown). On the other hand, Ror2 siRNA failed to inhibit JNK activation induced by anisomycin, an inhibitor of protein synthesis (data not shown). These results indicate an essential role of Ror2 in Wnt5a-induced JNK activation. Furthermore, Wnt5a-induced c-Jun phosphorylation in wound-edge cells was impaired in Ror2-depleted cells (Fig. 4B), confirming that Wnt5a-induced JNK activation in wound-edge cells is mediated by Ror2. Considering that Wnt5a-induced cell polarization is also seen in cells at the wound edge, these findings support a notion that Wnt5a/Ror2-mediated JNK activation may play critical roles in regulating cell polarity at the wound edge. JNK Activity Is Required for Wnt5a-induced Polarized Cell Migration—We then examined the effect of inhibition of JNK on Wnt5a-induced polarized cell migration. To this end, we used two structurally unrelated JNK inhibitors, SP600125 and JNK inhibitor I (cell-permeable peptide consisting of HIV-TAT48-57 and JNK-binding domain of JIP1), that act through different mechanisms. These inhibitors efficiently suppressed Wnt5a-induced JNK activation in wounded monolayers of cells, as assessed by antiphospho-c-Jun immunoblotting (data not shown). Treatment of cells with SP600125 resulted in suppression of Wnt5a-induced wound closure in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). Wnt5a-induced lamellipodia formation and MTOC reorientation in wound-edge cells were also markedly suppressed by treatment with SP600125 (Fig. 5, C and E). The JNK inhibitor I also inhibited these biological responses of cells to Wnt5a (Fig. 5, B, D, and F). However, it lowered the basal level of MTOC reorientation (Fig. 5F, neo CM), probably due to toxicity of this peptide inhibitor via its cell-permeable portion, HIV-TAT48-57, since control peptide, which consists of the HIV-TAT48-57 peptide alone, also suppressed to a similar extent. Taken together, the results indicate that JNK activity is critically required for Wnt5a-induced polarized cell migration during wound closure. At present, it remains unclear about the mechanism by which JNK regulates cell polarization and migration after Wnt5a stimulation. With this respect, it should be noted that, despite increased phosphorylation of c-Jun transcription factor by JNK, gene expression may not be required at least for Wnt5a-induced MTOC reorientation, because it was unaffected by treatment with actinomycin D, an inhibitor of transcription (data not shown). It will be of interest to investigate whether or not JNK directly phosphorylates proteins that regulate MTOC reorientation. Association of Ror2 with FLNa Is Indispensable for Wnt5a-induced JNK Activation and Polarized Cell Migration—We have recently shown that FLNa is associated with Ror2 and is required for Wnt5a-induced cell migration (3Nishita M. Yoo S.K. Nomachi A. Kani S. Sougawa N. Ohta Y. Takada S. Kikuchi A. Minami Y. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). FLNa is also known to mediate JNK activation by various stimuli, acting as a scaffold protein (35Leonardi A. Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H. Franzoso G. Brown K. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 271-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 36Marti A. Luo Z. Cunningham C. Ohta Y. Hartwig J. Stossel T.P. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2620-2628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Thus, the findings prompted us to examine whether or not FLNa is involved in Wnt5a-induced JNK activation in wounded cells. To this end, we utilized the FLNa-deficient human melanoma cell line (M2) and its derivative line (A7), which stably expresses FLNa (Fig. 6A) (31Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Wnt5a stimulation resulted in substantial activation of JNK in A7, but marginal in M2 cells (Fig. 6, A and C). On the other hand, anisomycin induced a marked JNK activation in both A7 and M2 cells (Fig. 6B), consistent with previous reports (35Leonardi A. Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H. Franzoso G. Brown K. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 271-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 36Marti A. Luo Z. Cunningham C. Ohta Y. Hartwig J. Stossel T.P. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2620-2628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Because knockdown of mouse FLNa in NIH3T3 cells has been unsuccessful (data not shown), we examined the effect of suppressed human FLNa expression in the human osteosarcoma cell line, SaOS2. As shown, suppression of FLNa expression by siRNA resulted in a substantial reduction of Wnt5a-induced JNK activation without affecting anisomycin-induced JNK activation in SaOS2 cells (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). These results indicate that FLNa is essential for Wnt5a-induced JNK activation. Because the FLN repeat 20 of FLNa is required for the association of FLNa with Ror2 (3Nishita M. Yoo S.K. Nomachi A. Kani S. Sougawa N. Ohta Y. Takada S. Kikuchi A. Minami Y. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), we next examined whether the FLN repeat 20 is also required for Wnt5a-induced JNK activation, by using M2 cells stably transfected with Myc-tagged wild-type FLNa (WT/M2) or the FLNa mutant lacking the FLN repeat 20, FLNaΔ20 (Δ20/M2) (3Nishita M. Yoo S.K. Nomachi A. Kani S. Sougawa N. Ohta Y. Takada S. Kikuchi A. Minami Y. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Both WT/M2 (10Schambony A. Wedlich D. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 779-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and Δ20/M2 (3Nishita M. Yoo S.K. Nomachi A. Kani S. Sougawa N. Ohta Y. Takada S. Kikuchi A. Minami Y. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) cells showed increased basal phosphorylation of JNK compared with parental M2 cells (Fig. 6C, neo), a feature that is also observed in A7 cells (see Fig. 6A). Importantly, unlike A7 and WT/M2 (10Schambony A. Wedlich D. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 779-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) cells, Wnt5a CM failed to augment further activation of JNK in Δ20/M2 (3Nishita M. Yoo S.K. Nomachi A. Kani S. Sougawa N. Ohta Y. Takada S. Kikuchi A. Minami Y. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) cells (Fig. 6C). It should be noted that anisomycin did activate JNK in Δ20/M2 (3Nishita M. Yoo S.K. Nomachi A. Kani S. Sougawa N. Ohta Y. Takada S. Kikuchi A. Minami Y. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) cells as did in M2 and WT/M2 (10Schambony A. Wedlich D. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 779-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) cells (Fig. 6D). These results further emphasize that FLNa plays an essential role in Wnt5a-induced JNK activation presumably by associating with Ror2 via the FLN repeat 20. Our previous study indicates that Wnt5a induces cell migration of A7, but not M2 cells in transwell migration assays (3Nishita M. Yoo S.K. Nomachi A. Kani S. Sougawa N. Ohta Y. Takada S. Kikuchi A. Minami Y. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, Wnt5a CM apparently promoted wound closure and MTOC reorientation of WT/M2 (10Schambony A. Wedlich D. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 779-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), but not M2 cells (Fig. 6, E and F). As shown, knockdown of FLNa expression also resulted in apparent inhibition of Wnt5a-induced MTOC reorientation in SaOS2 cells (supplemental Fig. S1C). It is also worth noting that Wnt5a CM failed to stimulate wound closure and MTOC reorientation of Δ20/M2 (3Nishita M. Yoo S.K. Nomachi A. Kani S. Sougawa N. Ohta Y. Takada S. Kikuchi A. Minami Y. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) cells (Fig. 6, E and F). Similar results were also obtained when another independent stable clones, WT/M2 (2Mikels A.J. Nusse R. PLoS. Biol. 2006; 4: e115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar) and Δ20/M2 (7Matsuda T. Nomi M. Ikeya M. Kani S. Oishi I. Terashima T. Takada S. Minami Y. Mech.

Taken together, these results indicate that FLNa and its association with Ror2 are critically required not only for JNK activation but also for polarized cell migration following Wnt5a stimulation. PKCζ Is Involved in Wnt5a-induced JNK Activation and Cell Polarization—It has recently been reported that Par/aPKC pathway cooperates with Wnt5a signaling to mediate cell polarization during wound healing of rat embryo fibroblasts (26Schlessinger K. McManus E.J. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To gain insights into the relationship between Wnt5a/Ror2/JNK and Par/aPKC pathways, we examined the effect of cell-permeable pseudo-substrate (PS) inhibitors specific for the respective PKC isoforms, including cPKC (PKCα/β), nPKC (PKCη and PKCθ), and aPKC (PKCζ), on Wnt5a-induced MTOC reorientation. As shown in Fig. 7, PS for PKCζ, but not other PSs, suppressed Wnt5a-induced MTOC reorientation, indicating that PKCζ activity is critical for Wnt5a-induced MTOC reorientation. Furthermore, PKCζ PS inhibited Wnt5a-induced JNK phosphorylation in wounded monolayers, while it failed to exert any inhibitory effect on anisomycin-induced JNK phosphorylation (Fig. 7B). Consistent with the results, anti-phospho-c-Jun immunostaining also revealed that PKCζ PS treatment inhibited Wnt5a-induced c-Jun phosphorylation in wound-edge cells (Fig. 7C). Therefore, PKCζ activity is critical for Wnt5a-induced JNK activation in wound-edge cells. Together, these results suggest that PKCζ, which is activated in response to wound-induced loss of cell-cell contacts (37Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Cell. 2001; 106: 489-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar), cooperates with Wnt5a/Ror2 signaling to activate JNK in the wound-edge cells, leading to cell polarization. In conclusion, we have shown that Ror2 mediates Wnt5a-induced polarized cell migration during wound healing of fibroblastic cells, via activation of JNK at the wound edge. Wnt5a-induced JNK activation and cell polarization require association of Ror2 with FLNa as well as PKCζ activity. The findings provide new insights into the role of Ror2 in the noncanonical Wnt5a/JNK pathway that regulates polarized cell migration in cooperation with Par/aPKC pathway. At present, it is unclear about the mechanisms by which FLNa and PKCζ regulate JNK activity in Wnt5a signaling and how activated JNK in turn regulates cell polarity and migration. Further study will be required to clarify these issues. We thank E. Fuchs for helpful suggestions and comments in the research and writing of this work. We thank A.

https://openalex.org/W2057737280,"Background An understanding of the evolution of potential signals from plants to the predators of their herbivores may provide exciting examples of co-evolution among multiple trophic levels. Understanding the mechanism behind the attraction of predators to plants is crucial to conclusions about co-evolution. For example, insectivorous birds are attracted to herbivore-damaged trees without seeing the herbivores or the defoliated parts, but it is not known whether birds use cues from herbivore-damaged plants with a specific adaptation of plants for this purpose. Methodology We examined whether signals from damaged trees attract avian predators in the wild and whether birds could use volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions or net photosynthesis of leaves as cues to detect herbivore-rich trees. We conducted a field experiment with mountain birches (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii), their main herbivore (Epirrita autumnata) and insectivorous birds. Half of the trees had herbivore larvae defoliating trees hidden inside branch bags and half had empty bags as controls. We measured predation rate of birds towards artificial larvae on tree branches, and VOC emissions and net photosynthesis of leaves. Principal Findings and Significance The predation rate was higher in the herbivore trees than in the control trees. This confirms that birds use cues from trees to locate insect-rich trees in the wild. The herbivore trees had decreased photosynthesis and elevated emissions of many VOCs, which suggests that birds could use either one, or both, as cues. There was, however, large variation in how the VOC emission correlated with predation rate. Emissions of (E)-DMNT [(E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene], β-ocimene and linalool were positively correlated with predation rate, while those of highly inducible green leaf volatiles were not. These three VOCs are also involved in the attraction of insect parasitoids and predatory mites to herbivore-damaged plants, which suggests that plants may not have specific adaptations to signal only to birds."
https://openalex.org/W2047093393,"Myosin Va transports intracellular cargoes along actin filaments in cells. This processive, two-headed motor takes multiple 36-nm steps in which the two heads swing forward alternately towards the barbed end of actin driven by ATP hydrolysis. The ability of myosin Va to move processively is a function of its long lever arm, the high duty ratio of its kinetic cycle and the gating of the kinetics between the two heads such that ADP release from the lead head is greatly retarded. Mechanical studies at the multiple- and the single-molecule level suggest that there is tight coupling (that is, one ATP is hydrolysed per power stroke), but this has not been directly demonstrated. We therefore investigated the coordination between the ATPase mechanism of the two heads of myosin Va and directly visualized the binding and dissociation of single fluorescently labelled nucleotide molecules, while simultaneously observing the stepping motion of the fluorescently labelled myosin Va as it moved along an actin filament. Here we show that preferential ADP dissociation from the trail head of mouse myosin Va is followed by ATP binding and a synchronous 36-nm step. Even at low ATP concentrations, the myosin Va molecule retained at least one nucleotide (ADP in the lead head position) when moving. Thus, we directly demonstrate tight coupling between myosin Va movement and the binding and dissociation of nucleotide by simultaneously imaging with near nanometre precision."
https://openalex.org/W2139585490,"Background Extracellular ATP is an important signaling molecule for vascular adaptation to limited oxygen availability (hypoxia). Here, we pursued the contribution of vascular endothelia to extracellular ATP release under hypoxic conditions. Methodology, Principal Findings We gained first insight from studying ATP release from endothelia (HMEC-1) pre-exposed to hypoxia. Surprisingly, we found that ATP release was significantly attenuated following hypoxia exposure (2% oxygen, 22±3% after 48 h). In contrast, intracellular ATP was unchanged. Similarly, lactate-dehydrogenase release into the supernatants was similar between normoxic or hypoxic endothelia, suggesting that differences in lytic ATP release between normoxia or hypoxia are minimal. Next, we used pharmacological strategies to study potential mechanisms for endothelial-dependent ATP release (eg, verapamil, dipyridamole, 18-alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid, anandamide, connexin-mimetic peptides). These studies revealed that endothelial ATP release occurs – at least in part - through connexin 43 (Cx43) hemichannels. A real-time RT-PCR screen of endothelial connexin expression showed selective repression of Cx43 transcript and additional studies confirmed time-dependent Cx43 mRNA, total and surface protein repression during hypoxia. In addition, hypoxia resulted in Cx43-serine368 phosphorylation, which is known to switch Cx43 hemi-channels from an open to a closed state. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, these studies implicate endothelial Cx43 in hypoxia-associated repression of endothelial ATP release."
https://openalex.org/W2042651276,"The identification of secreted factors that can selectively stimulate the generation of insulin producing β-cells from stem and/or progenitor cells represent a significant step in the development of stem cell-based β-cell replacement therapy. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms that regulate the generation of β-cells during normal pancreatic development such putative factors may be identified. In the mouse, β-cells increase markedly in numbers from embryonic day (e) 14.5 and onwards, but the extra-cellular signal(s) that promotes the selective generation of β-cells at these stages remains to be identified. Here we show that the retinoic acid (RA) synthesizing enzyme Raldh1 is expressed in developing mouse and human pancreas at stages when β-cells are generated. We also provide evidence that RA induces the generation of Ngn3+ endocrine progenitor cells and stimulates their further differentiation into β-cells by activating a program of cell differentiation that recapitulates the normal temporal program of β-cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2079009895,"Background The Forkhead box O (FOXO) class of transcription factors are involved in the regulation of several cellular responses including cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Furthermore, in model organisms FOXOs act as tumor suppressors and affect aging. Previously, we noted that FOXOs and p53 are remarkably similar within their spectrum of regulatory proteins [1]. For example, the de-ubiquitinating enzyme USP7 removes ubiquitin from both FOXO and p53. However, Skp2 has been identified as E3 ligase for FOXO1, whereas Mdm2 is the prime E3 ligase for p53. Principal Findings/Methodology Here we provide evidence that Mdm2 acts as an E3 ligase for FOXO as well. In vitro incubation of Mdm2 and FOXO results in ATP-dependent (multi)mono-ubiquitination of FOXO similar to p53. Furthermore, in vivo co-expression of Mdm2 and FOXO induces FOXO mono-ubiquitination and consistent with this result, siRNA-mediated depletion of Mdm2 inhibits mono-ubiquitination of FOXO induced by hydrogen peroxide. Regulation of FOXO ubiquitination by Mdm2 is likely to be direct since Mdm2 and FOXO co-immunoprecipitate. In addition, Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination regulates FOXO transcriptional activity. Conclusions/Significance These data identify Mdm2 as a novel E3 ligase for FOXOs and extend the analogous mode of regulation between FOXO and p53."
https://openalex.org/W2077524840,"Tail-anchored (TA) protein synthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) represents a distinct and novel process that provides a paradigm for understanding post-translational membrane insertion in eukaryotes. The major route for delivering TA proteins to the ER requires both ATP and one or more cytosolic factors that facilitate efficient membrane insertion. Until recently, the identity of these cytosolic components was elusive, but two candidates have now been suggested to promote ATP-dependent TA protein integration. The first is the cytosolic chaperone complex of Hsp40/Hsc70, and the second is a novel ATPase denoted Asna-1 or TRC40. In this study we focus on the role of the Hsp40/Hsc70 complex in promoting TA protein biogenesis at the ER. We show that the membrane integration of most TA proteins is stimulated by Hsp40/Hsc70 when using purified components and a reconstituted system. In contrast, when both Hsp40/Hsc70 and Asna-1/TRC40 are provided as a complete system, small molecule inhibition of Hsp40/Hsc70 indicates that only a subset of TA proteins are obligatory clients for this chaperone-mediated delivery route. We show that the hydrophobicity of the TA region dictates whether a precursor is delivered to the ER via the Hsp40/Hsc70 or Asna-1/TRC40-dependent route, and we conclude that these distinct cytosolic ATPases are responsible for two different ATP-dependent pathways of TA protein biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2046221670,"Loss of the transcription factor E2F1 elicits a complex metabolic phenotype in mice underscored by reduced adiposity and protection from high fat diet-induced diabetes. Here, we demonstrate that E2F1 directly regulates the gene encoding PDK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4), a key nutrient sensor and modulator of glucose homeostasis that is chronically elevated in obesity and diabetes and acutely induced under the metabolic stress of starvation or fasting. We show that loss of E2F1 in vivo blunts PDK4 expression and improves myocardial glucose oxidation. The absence of E2F1 also corresponds to lower blood glucose levels, improved plasma lipid profile, and increased sensitivity to insulin stimulation. Consistently, enforced E2F1 expression up-regulates PDK4 levels and suppresses glucose oxidation in C2C12 myoblasts. Furthermore, inactivation of Rb, the repressor of E2F-dependent transcription, markedly induces PDK4 and triggers the enrichment of E2F1 occupancy onto the PDK4 promoter as detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Two overlapping E2F binding sites were identified on this promoter. Transactivation assays later verified E2F1 responsiveness of this promoter element in C2C12 myoblasts and IMR90 fibroblasts, an effect that was completely abrogated following mutation of the E2F sites. Taken together, our data illustrate how the E2F1 mitogen directly regulates PDK4 levels and influences cellular bioenergetics, namely mitochondrial glucose oxidation.

These results are relevant to the pathophysiology of chronic diseases like obesity and diabetes, where PDK4 is dysregulated and could have implications pertinent to the etiology of tumor metabolism, especially in cancers with Rb pathway defects. Insulin responsiveness and the efficient utilization of glucose are greatly influenced by the activity of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 3The abbreviations used are: PDK, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase; FA, fatty acid; ER, estrogen receptor; OHT, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; WT, wild type; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; IWHP, isolated working heart perfusion; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; ER-E2F1, E2F1-estrogen receptor fusion construct. 3The abbreviations used are: PDK, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase; FA, fatty acid; ER, estrogen receptor; OHT, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; WT, wild type; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; IWHP, isolated working heart perfusion; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; ER-E2F1, E2F1-estrogen receptor fusion construct. family (PDK1 to -4). As part of a large multimeric complex known as the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, these kinases phosphorylate and inactivate the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme, another pyruvate dehydrogenase complex component, to inhibit the transition (decarboxylation) of glycolysis end product pyruvate to mitochondrial acetyl-CoA, with the net result of curtailing mitochondrial glucose oxidation (1Kwon H.S. Harris R.A. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2004; 44: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 4Huang B. Wu P. Bowker-Kinley M.M. Harris R.A. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). As such, PDKs are widely viewed as critical nutrient sensors and modulators of cellular metabolic patterns in response to nutrient shortage like starvation or fasting and important regulators of cell bioenergetics during post-prandial states as well. Experiments to date suggest that PDK4 is a major isoenzyme responsible for changes in pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity (1Kwon H.S. Harris R.A. Adv.

For instance, metabolic stress conditions, such as starvation, fasting, or glucose deprivation markedly induce muscle PDK4 expression (5Wu P. Blair P.V. Sato J. Jaskiewicz J. Popov K.M. Harris R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 381: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 6Spriet L.L. Tunstall R.J. Watt M.J. Mehan K.A. Hargreaves M. Cameron-Smith D. J. Appl.

FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3004-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), presumably to prevent hypoglycemia and spare glucose for glucose-dependent tissues like the brain. Refeeding restores PDK4 levels to fed states. Increased fatty acid (FA) flux also up-regulates PDK4 expression in muscle, and this effect is reversed by insulin treatment (7Abbot E.L. McCormack J.G. Reynet C. Hassall D.G. Buchan K.W. Yeaman S.J. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3004-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, hypolipidemic drugs like PPARα agonists, which promote FA uptake and utilization, induce PDK4 expression (7Abbot E.L. McCormack J.G. Reynet C. Hassall D.G. Buchan K.W. Yeaman S.J. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3004-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). PDK4 is also induced by steroid hormones, such as retinoic acids (8Kwon H.S. Huang B. Ho Jeoung N. Wu P. Steussy C.N. Harris R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1759: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and glucocorticoids like dexamethasone (4Huang B. Wu P. Bowker-Kinley M.M. Harris R.A. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and is co-activated by the global metabolic regulator PGC-1α (9Wende A.R. Huss J.M. Schaeffer P.J. Giguere V. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10684-10694Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Importantly, constitutively high PDK4 levels are documented in chronic diseases, such as diabetes (10Wu P. Sato J. Zhao Y. Jaskiewicz J. Popov K.M. Harris R.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and are believed to promote insulin resistance at least through the inhibition of efficient muscle glucose utilization. Recently, we showed that increased FA flux, via the membrane translocase CD36, regulates PDK4 expression in a PPARδ/β-dependent manner. This was reported as a potential mechanism for transcriptional control of glucose homeostasis in muscle under the metabolic stress of fasting (11Nahle Z. Hsieh M. Pietka T. Coburn C.T. Grimaldi P.A.

Here, we investigate the interplay between the transcription factor E2F1 and the PDK4 isoenzyme. E2F1 is a critical regulator of survival and proliferation. It controls timely and accurate cell cycle progression by activating S-phase entry genes (12Harbour J.W. Luo R.X. Dei Santi A. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 15Attwooll C. Lazzerini Denchi E. Helin K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4709-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and regulating components of the G2/M checkpoint (16Hernando E. Nahle Z. Juan G. Diaz-Rodriguez E. Alaminos M. Hemann M.

Biol. 2006; 2 (2006 0029)Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Consistent with such a role, E2F1 is a key component of the Rb (retinoblastoma)-E2F tumor suppressor complex, and its activity is largely controlled by the Rb tumor suppressor, a protein that is highly inactivated in cancer and that typically binds E2F1 and represses its transcription activities and functions. Using in vitro and in vivo systems where expression and function of E2F1 and Rb were manipulated, we characterize a novel mechanism through which Rb inactivation and unrestrained E2F1 activity can chronically alter muscle bioenergetics, namely glucose oxidation, and transcriptionally regulate PDK4 expression. The direct interaction between E2F1, a potent mitogen-stimulated cell cycle regulator on the one hand, and PDK4, a critical nutrient sensor and modulator of glucose homeostasis on the other hand, provides a framework for a dynamic regulation of cellular fuel preference by Rb-E2F1 and underscores the intimate coupling between cell cycle events and the regulation of mitochondrial glucose oxidation. We suggest that the findings of this study are relevant to the pathophysiology of chronic metabolic diseases where PDK4 is dysregulated. The results could also have implications related to the etiology of cancer-associated metabolic patterns by means of characterizing a transcriptional and functional link coupling the Rb-E2F1 tumor suppressor complex to a key component of the mitochondrial metabolic machinery, the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. Cells, Gene Transfer, and Drug Treatment—IMR90, U2OS, and C2C12 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Primary mouse embryo fibroblasts from wild type and Rb–/– mice were isolated and cultured as described (16Hernando E. Nahle Z. Juan G. Diaz-Rodriguez E. Alaminos M. Hemann M. Michel L. Mittal V.

For ER constructs, E2F1 activity was induced by the addition of 250 nm 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT; Sigma). Cell viability was determined using a trypan blue exclusion assay. For experiments involving cycloheximide, cells were incubated with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) for the indicated times. Protein and Gene Expression—Hearts were excised immediately following animal sacrifice and then wetted with 0.5 ml of buffer (100 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris, 5 mm NaN3, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) and blotted on Whatman papers to remove fluids, finely minced on ice with a razor blade, and homogenized on ice in a hand-held electric homogenizer (PowerGen 125; Fisher) in SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol), followed by boiling for 5 min. For experiments involving cell cultures, cells were collected according to common procedures. Protein concentration was quantified using the Bio-Rad protein assay, and 30 μg of total lysate were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore, Billerica, MA) membranes, which were blotted with the appropriate antibodies: E2F1 (1:1000; sc-251, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), E1A (1:1000; sc-430; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), caspase 7 (1:1000; 9492, Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA), PDK4 (1:1000 (AP7041b (Abgent, San Diego, CA)) or 1:500 (sc14495 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)), Ran (1:2000; sc-1156; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and α-tubulin (1:2000; B-5-1-2; Sigma). Anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (1858413; Amersham Biosciences) and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1858415; Amersham Biosciences) were used as secondary antibodies. Proteins were visualized using ECL detection (RPN 2132; Amersham Biosciences). Mouse Models—E2F1–/– mice (B6;129S4-E2F1tm1Meg/J) and wild type (WT) controls (B6;129SF2/J) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory. E2F1–/– (FVB) and controls were provided by Dr. G. Leone (Ohio State University). All animal procedures were approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee. Serum Analysis—Whole blood was collected in EDTA by the cheek pouch method of fasted (overnight) animals. Plasma was collected by centrifugation (2940 × g for 5 min). Total cholesterol (Sigma), triglycerides (Sigma), glucose (Sigma), and nonesterified fatty acids (Wako Chemicals U.S. Inc., Richmond, VA) were analyzed using commercial kits according to the manufacturers' specifications. Insulin Tolerance Test—Adult male mice (11–12 weeks old) fasted for 6 h received an intraperitoneal injection of human insulin at a dose of 0.75 units/kg of body weight. Glucose was measured via the tail vein before the insulin injection and afterward at 30 and 60 min. Echo MRI—Measurements of body fat, lean mass, body fluids, and total body water in WT and E2F1–/– mice without the need for anesthesia or sedation were obtained using the EchoMRI 3-in-1™, a Quantitative Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (QNMR) system. Adult male mice (12 weeks old) were used. Isolated Working Heart Perfusion (IWHP) and in Vivo Metabolic Measurement—Adult male mice (11–12 weeks old with 25–30-g body weight) fasted for 16 h were heparinized 10 min before anesthesia. Animals were then deeply anesthetized, and hearts were excised and placed in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate solution. Hearts were cannulated first via the aorta with an 18-gauge plastic cannula and perfused retrogradely by the Langendorff method with Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate solution. During this time, the left atrium was cannulated through a pulmonary opening with a 16-gauge steel cannula. Once the cannulation for the working heart mode was complete, the Langendorff line was closed, and the left atrial and aortic lines were opened and perfused with Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate solution containing 5.0 mm glucose, 0.4 mm palmitate bound to 3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and 600 pm insulin with a preload pressure of 11.5 mm Hg and an after load pressure of 50 mm Hg. Spontaneously beating hearts were subjected to a 60-min aerobic perfusion with oxygenated buffer solution. To determine glucose oxidation, trace amounts of [U-14C]glucose (0.1 μCi/ml) was used. Functional measurements were acquired for 10 s every 10 min with the MP100 system from AcqKnowledge (BioPac Systems, Santa Barbara, CA). Real Time PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from tissues and cells using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions, and reverse transcription-PCR was performed as described (11Nahle Z.

Primer sequences used were as follows: 18 S, AGTCCCTGCCCTTTGTACACA and GATCCGAGGGCCTCACTAAAC; PDK4, TTTCTCGTCTCTACGCCAAG and GATACACCAGTCATCAGCTTCG. Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cells were grown on cover-slips and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Following permeabilization with Triton X-100 and blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies and then with FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies with 3 washes after each incubation. Nuclear localization was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Glucose Oxidation—For glucose oxidation in cell culture, [U-14C] labeled glucose was used and the amount oxidized was evaluated by measuring the 14CO2 produced as previously described (11Nahle Z. Hsieh M. Pietka T. Coburn C.T. Grimaldi P.A. Zhang M.Q. Das D. Abumrad N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14317-14326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 19Bastie C.C.

Cells were washed three times with Krebs-Ringer Hepes containing 40 μm fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and incubated for 1–2 h in the same buffer containing U-14C-labeled glucose (1 μCi/80 μm). 14CO2 trapping was performed (using a flask with a well containing a filter soaked with benzethonium hydroxide) overnight at 30 °C with gentle shaking. Glucose oxidation in the heart is described above. Bioinformatic Analysis of the PDK4 Promoter—mRNA sequences of human PDK4 (NM_002612) were retrieved from the NCBI nucleotide data base, and its proximal promoter sequence (from –700 to +300 around the transcription start site) was obtained from the CSHLmpd mammalian promoter data base (20Xuan Z. Zhao F. Wang J. Chen G. Zhang M.Q. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: R72-R72.12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MATCH program associated with the TRANSFAC data base (21Kel A.E. Kel-Margoulis O.V. Farnham P.J. Bartley S.M. Wingender E. Zhang M.Q. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 99-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) was run to minimize the false negative rate in order to identify the potential E2F1 binding sites. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (CHIP) Analysis of PDK4 Promoter—CHIP was performed as previously described (16Hernando E. Nahle Z. Juan G. Diaz-Rodriguez E. Alaminos M. Hemann M. Michel L. Mittal V.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), using an E2F1-specific antibody (E2F1 sc-193; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). DNA released from precipitated complexes was amplified using sequence-specific primers to detect PDK4 promoter elements (Fig. 4E, oligonucleotides 1 and 2). As controls, oligonucleotides corresponding to the indicated positions (Fig. 4E, oligonucleotides 3 and 4) were used to amplify sequences within the cyclin A gene. Luciferase Assays—Genomic fragments corresponding to the human PDK4 promoter (described above) were amplified by PCR from human muscle genomic DNA using the sequence-specific primers (available upon request) to introduce KpnI/XhoI restriction enzyme sites. Following purification and digestion cycles, amplicons were cloned into the pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI) at KpnI/XhoI sites. IMR90 and C2C12 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions with 1 μg of the reporter construct, 200 ng of the E2F1 expression plasmid or a vector control, and 1.2 μg of the pRL-β-globin control plasmid (Promega). Cells were harvested 36 h after transfection (or as indicated otherwise). Luciferase activity was assayed using a luminometer (Promega 20/20), and data were normalized to the transfection control pRL-β-globin. The human Caspase 7 promoter was used as a positive control. Sequences of oligonucleotides are available on request. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The E2F binding site in the human PDK promoter was mutated using site-directed mutagenesis performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PDK4 primer sequences are follows (with mutated nucleotides in lowercase type): CTTTCTCTGATCTGATTaaCGtGACCTGGAGTTCAGGACGCG and CGCGTCCTGAACTCCAGGTCaCGttAATCAGATCAGAGAAAG. Mutations were verified by ABI automated sequencing through the Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory facility at Washington University, and clones were analyzed using Vector NTI, version 10. Statistical Analysis—Values are expressed as means ± S.E. Student's t test (two-tailed) was performed to determine the statistical difference between groups. p values of <0.05 were considered significantly different (*), and p of <0.01 was considered highly significant (**). All experiments were repeated at least three times, and each represents a minimum of three biological replicas. E2F1 Loss Promotes Insulin Sensitivity and Improves Myocardial Glucose Oxidation—Homozygous loss of E2F1 influences basic metabolic patterns in vivo, as detected by the change in a number of metabolic markers. As shown in Fig. 1A, sera obtained from E2F1–/– animals and their WT counterparts following an overnight fast shows lower blood glucose levels as well as features of improved plasma lipid profiles underscored by marked reduction in cholesterol, triglycerides, and nonesterified free fatty acids. Echo MRI was performed to determine body fat composition, and as shown in Fig. 1B, E2F1–/– mice are significantly leaner, with 73% less body fat compared with WT. These results suggest an improved insulin response in E2F1–/– mice, which would be consistent with earlier findings (22Fajas L. Annicotte J.S. Miard S. Sarruf D. Watanabe M. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). An intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test was conducted to evaluate glucose disposal in response to insulin in our E2F1–/– mice. Following insulin injections (0.75 units/kg of body weight), blood glucose was assayed as a function of time. Glucose clearance was significantly improved in E2F1–/– compared with age- and gender-matched WT mice, as depicted in Fig. 1C. The function of the heart upon E2F1 loss was also examined by (i) echocardiography to assess the mechanical aspect of the heart as a pump and (ii) IWHP to determine glucose oxidation efficiency. M-mode echocardiography did not reveal a detectable difference between the two genotypes, E2F1–/– and WT controls (data not shown). However, analysis of myocardial glucose oxidation by IWHP in the beating heart revealed significant improvement of glucose utilization in E2F1–/– mice. As shown in Fig. 1D, hearts of E2F1-null mice are markedly better in oxidizing [U-14C]glucose compared with WT controls. Together, these data demonstrate that the loss of E2F1 enhances the overall metabolic profile, promotes insulin sensitivity, and stimulates myocardial glucose utilization in vivo. E2F1 Expression Induces PDK4 and Blunts Glucose Oxidation—We determined whether factors known to regulate myocardial glucose oxidation, such as the PDK4 enzyme, are altered in the E2F1-deficient hearts. As described earlier, PDK4 is a key inhibitor of glucose oxidation and a regulator of myocardial fuel utilization patterns. Moreover, recent data from a heart-specific PDK4 transgenic mouse model demonstrates that PDK4 overexpression in the heart is sufficient to reduce myocardial glucose oxidation (23Zhao G. Jeoung N.H. Burgess S.C. Rosaaen-Stowe K.A. Inagaki T. Latif S. Shelton J.M. McAnally J. Bassel-Duby R. Harris R.A. Richardson J.A. Kliewer S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2008; 294: H936-H943Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A reduction in PDK4 expression with E2F1 loss would be consistent with the aforementioned improved myocardial glucose oxidation in the E2F1–/– mice (Fig. 1D). Protein expression of PDK4 was analyzed in total heart lysates of E2F1-deficient and -proficient mice. As shown by Western blot analysis in Fig. 2A, an expression pattern reflecting blunted PDK4 expression in the E2F1–/– heart was readily detected. Since various hormonal and nutritional inputs contribute to PDK4 regulation, we asked if PDK4 expression is directly linked to E2F1 expression. An approach using an inducible E2F1-estrogen receptor fusion construct (ER-E2F1) (14Vigo E. Muller H. Prosperini E. Hateboer G. Cartwright P. Moroni M.C. Helin K. Mol. Cell.

Cold Spring Harbor LaboratoryNat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), where nuclear translocation of E2F1 can be induced by OHT, was applied. This circumvents the cytotoxic effects of prolonged ectopic E2F1 expression and enables us to determine the kinetics of PDK4 expression as a time course following E2F1 activation. C2C12 myoblasts cells were stably infected with high titer retroviruses harboring ER-E2F1 and a gene encoding the antibiotic resistance marker. Following selection of transduced populations as described (18Nahle Z. Polakoff J. Davuluri R.V. McCurrach M.E. Jacobson M.D. Narita M. Zhang M.Q. Lazebnik Y. Bar-Sagi D. Lowe S.W. Cold Spring Harbor LaboratoryNat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), immunofluorescence analysis was performed to confirm nuclear translocation of exogenous E2F1 upon OHT treatment. As shown in Fig. 2B, immunofluorescence analysis performed with E2F1-specific antibodies shows E2F1 nuclear localization following OHT treatment. To further validate the function of the ER-E2F1 system, we performed a viability assay following a DNA damage challenge. As shown in Fig. 2C, E2F1 sensitizes cells to the DNA-damaging agent adriamycin as expected. E2F1 also induces the known E2F1 target caspase 7 proenzyme (18Nahle Z. Polakoff J. Davuluri R.V. McCurrach M.E. Jacobson M.D. Narita M. Zhang M.Q. Lazebnik Y. Bar-Sagi D. Lowe S.W. Cold Spring Harbor LaboratoryNat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 2D. Importantly, PDK4 protein expression, determined in these same lysates, is rapidly induced following E2F1 activation as well (Fig. 2D). Consistently, glucose oxidation was markedly reduced in these cells with activated E2F1. As shown in Fig. 2E, glucose oxidation determined from 14CO2 production in cells incubated with d-[U-14C]glucose as described (19Bastie C.C. Nahle Z. McLoughlin T. Esser K. Zhang W. Unterman T. Abumrad N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14222-14229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was significantly blunted upon E2F1 induction. Such effect of enforced E2F1 expression on PDK4 and glucose oxidation ex vivo is in line with the effects we detect in E2F1–/– hearts and collectively supports the interpretation that PDK4 expression and its effect on glucose oxidation is regulated by E2F1. Of note, we focus in this investigation on the PDK4 isoenzyme, because it is distinctive among the PDK family in its response to starvation and diabetes in the heart (10Wu P. Sato J. Zhao Y. Jaskiewicz J. Popov K.M. Harris R.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This was also stimulated by the phenotype of the aforementioned heart-specific PDK4 transgenic mouse. Nevertheless, other PDKs may be the target of similar regulation by E2F1. In the same analysis, other E2F family members, in particular E2F2, which shares great sequence homology with E2F1, can be regulating the PDKs and influencing muscle glucose oxidation as well. To that extent, loss of E2F1 alone was sufficient to induce robust effects on PDK4 expression, underscoring the importance of this E2F family member in regulating this PDK isoenzyme. Rb Inactivation and Oncogenic E1A Induce PDK4—Analysis of PDK4 transcript levels following induction by E2F1 shows up-regulation of PDK4 mRNA consistent with PDK4 protein expression in ER-E2F1-expressing C2C12 myoblasts upon induction with OHT (Fig. 3A). Importantly, such induction is observed despite the presence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis. As such, transcriptional activation of E2F1 appears to be required for its ability to induce PDK4, implicating it as a direct E2F1 transcriptional target. The rapid induction of PDK4 is also characteristic of the induction kinetics of bona fide early response E2F1 targets like procaspases, HURP, and CDC16 determined using the same E2F1-inducible system (17Das D.

https://openalex.org/W2128130820,"While climate change is inherently a global problem, its public health impacts will be experienced most acutely at the local and regional level, with some jurisdictions likely to be more burdened than others. The public health infrastructure in the U.S. is organized largely as an interlocking set of public agencies at the federal, state and local level, with lead responsibility for each city or county often residing at the local level. To understand how directors of local public health departments view and are responding to climate change as a public health issue, we conducted a telephone survey with 133 randomly selected local health department directors, representing a 61% response rate. A majority of respondents perceived climate change to be a problem in their jurisdiction, a problem they viewed as likely to become more common or severe over the next 20 years. Only a small minority of respondents, however, had yet made climate change adaptation or prevention a top priority for their health department. This discrepancy between problem recognition and programmatic responses may be due, in part, to several factors: most respondents felt personnel in their health department--and other key stakeholders in their community--had a lack of knowledge about climate change; relatively few respondents felt their own health department, their state health department, or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had the necessary expertise to help them create an effective mitigation or adaptation plan for their jurisdiction; and most respondents felt that their health department needed additional funding, staff and staff training to respond effectively to climate change. These data make clear that climate change adaptation and prevention are not currently major activities at most health departments, and that most, if not all, local health departments will require assistance in making this transition. We conclude by making the case that, through their words and actions, local health departments and their staff can and should play a role in alerting members of their community about the prospect of public health impacts from climate change in their jurisdiction."
https://openalex.org/W1987436161,"LuxR-type transcription factors are typically used by bacteria to determine the population density of their own species by detecting N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs). However, while Escherichia and Salmonella encode a LuxR-type AHL receptor, SdiA, they cannot synthesize AHLs. In vitro, it is known that SdiA can detect AHLs produced by other bacterial species.In this report, we tested the hypothesis that SdiA detects the AHL-production of other bacterial species within the animal host. SdiA did not detect AHLs during the transit of Salmonella through the gastrointestinal tract of a guinea pig, a rabbit, a cow, 5 mice, 6 pigs, or 12 chickens. However, SdiA was activated during the transit of Salmonella through turtles. All turtles examined were colonized by the AHL-producing species Aeromonas hydrophila.We conclude that the normal gastrointestinal microbiota of most animal species do not produce AHLs of the correct type, in an appropriate location, or in sufficient quantities to activate SdiA. However, the results obtained with turtles represent the first demonstration of SdiA activity in animals."
https://openalex.org/W2087057741,"Wnt-3a is a ligand that activates the β-catenin-dependent pathway in Wnt signaling, which is implicated in numerous physiological events such as morphogenesis. So far, heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans have been highlighted as a low affinity receptor for morphogens containing Wnts. Here we show the importance of chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycans in the efficient signaling of Wnt-3a and the structural features of CS required for the regulation of Wnt-3a signaling. Wnt-3a signaling was depressed in a mouse L cell mutant, called sog9, which is defective in the EXT1 gene encoding the HS-synthesizing enzyme and the chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase (C4ST-1) gene compared with parental L cells. The transfection of sog9 cells with C4ST-1 resulted in the recovery of Wnt-3a signaling, whereas the expression of EXT1 in sog9 cells could not restore Wnt-3a signaling. In addition, the expression level of introduced C4ST-1 correlated with the recovery of Wnt-3a signaling accompanied by the increased expression of the E disaccharide unit of CS. Interestingly, molecular interaction analyses using Biacore revealed that squid CS-E (rich in the E disaccharide unit) bound strongly to Wnt-3a (Kd = 13.2 nm) to the same extent as heparin from bovine lung (Kd = 8.43 nm). In contrast, other CS isoforms as well as HS isolated from bovine kidney showed little binding activity to Wnt-3a. Moreover, exogenously added CS-E potently inhibited the accumulation of β-catenin induced by Wnt-3a. These results suggest that CS-E-like structures synthesized by C4ST-1 participate in Wnt-3a signaling and modulate the physiological events caused by Wnt-3a signals.

These results suggest that CS-E-like structures synthesized by C4ST-1 participate in Wnt-3a signaling and modulate the physiological events caused by Wnt-3a signals. The Wnt signaling pathway, which is largely conserved from Drosophila to humans, is involved in many aspects of early embryonic development, including axis specification and organogenesis. Wnt signaling events have also been shown to be implicated in a number of cancers, chondrogenesis, and neurological conditions (1.Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 781-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (4239) Google Scholar, 2.Moon R.T. Bowerman B. Boutros M. Perrimon N. Science. 2002; 296: 1644-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Wnt signaling is transduced into cells through receptors of Frizzled and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 families (LRP5/6) (Arrow in Drosophila); consequently, the β-catenin/T cell factor pathway (3.Molenaar M. van de Wetering M.

Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 279-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar) is activated. Of these pathways, the most canonical signal pathway is the Wnt/β-catenin/T cell factor pathway (6.Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). In the absence of Wnt stimulation, soluble β-catenin is unstable because it is continuously targeted to the proteasome via O-linked phosphorylation. Once Wnt binds to Frizzled, GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3β) that phosphorylates β-catenin is inactivated. As a result, β-catenin accumulates in the cytosol and is then translocated into the nucleus, where it interacts with T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor family to activate specific gene expression; therefore, accumulation of β-catenin is used as an indicator of canonical Wnt signaling response in the cells. Proteoglycans (PGs) 2The abbreviations used are: PG, proteoglycan; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; C4ST-1, chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase; CS, chondroitin sulfate; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; HS, heparan sulfate; TGFβ, transforming growth factorβ; ΔDi-0S, ΔHexAα1-3GalNAc; ΔDi-6S, ΔHexAα1-3GalNAc(6S); ΔDi-4S, ΔHexAα1-3GalNAc(4S); ΔDi-diSD, ΔHexA(2S)α1-3GalNAc(6S); ΔDi-diSE, ΔHexAα1-3GalNAc(4S,6S); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. are abundant extracellular and cell-surface molecules that consist of a protein core to which highly sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) chains are covalently attached. According to their sugar composition, GAGs are classified roughly into heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS). GAGs interact with numerous proteins, including growth factors, morphogens, and extracellular matrix proteins, and these interactions regulate key events in development and normal physiology. Therefore, defects or dysfunctions of GAG biosynthetic enzymes affect many signal pathways, including members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, transforming growth factors (TGFs), bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), Hedgehog, and Wnt proteins. Disorder of HS biosynthesis by etiological mutations of either EXT1 or EXT2, which encodes a glycosyltransferase responsible for HS polymerization, causes hereditary multiple exostoses, an autosomal-dominant bone disorder. A lack of HS in hereditary multiple exostoses is considered to affect proper Ihh signaling and its diffusion, leading to aberrant bony growths (7.Duncan G. McCormick C. Tufaro F. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that extracellular Wingless (Wg), which is a homologue of vertebrate Wnt-1, is tightly associated with the cell surface via GAG chains (8.Reichsman F. Smith L. Cumberledge S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and previous studies using Drosophila genetics also show that HS plays a crucial role in extracellular distribution of Wg and its long range signaling (6.Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Most recently, Shortkroff and Yates (9.Shortkroff S. Yates K.E. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2007; 15: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) examined whether alteration of GAGs affected Wnt signaling because loss of extracellular matrix GAGs is an early change in osteoarthritis and the Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway controls chondrogenesis. As a result, they found that the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in articular cartilage was diminished by a decrease in sulfation or amounts of CS (9.Shortkroff S. Yates K.E. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2007; 15: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Taken together, the importance of GAG in the regulation of Wnt signaling is highlighted at present. Here, by taking advantage of mouse L cell fibroblasts and their mutant sog9 cells defective in the expression of EXT1 and C4ST-1 (chondroitin-4-O-sulfotransferase-1), we showed that the response of L cells to Wnt3a is affected by changes in the amounts and structures of CS and that a CS biosynthetic enzyme, C4ST-1, is responsible for their changes. C4ST-1 is reported to regulate the expression of E disaccharides (10.Uyama T. Ishida M. Izumikawa T. Trybala E. Tufaro F. Bergstrom T. Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38668-38674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which are characteristic structures found in CS-E. Examination of the binding of Wnt-3a to CS-E and the effects of exogenous CS-E on Wnt-3a signaling revealed that Wnt-3a strongly bound to CS-E and that preincubation of Wnt-3a with CS-E efficiently inhibited the Wnt-3a signaling pathway. These findings indicate that C4ST-1 regulates Wnt-3a signaling by controlling E disaccharide expression of CS. Furthermore, it was shown that CS chains synthesized by C4ST-1 trap Wnt-3a on the cell surface, enhancing cellular responses to Wnt-3a where Wnt-3a is limited. Thus, we propose here that, in addition to HS (11.Bulow H.E. Hobert O. Neuron. 2004; 41: 723-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), individual modifications to CS in a given area give rise to a “sugar code” that regulates morphogen signaling by modulating specific receptor-ligand interactions. Materials—Purified recombinant mouse Wnt-3a was obtained fromR&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). An anti-Wnt-3a antibody and the anti-β-catenin antibody (H-102) were purchased from Abcam Inc.

Chondroitinase ABC from Proteus vulgaris (EC 4.2.2.20), the anti-chondroitin sulfate antibody (2-B-6), whale cartilage CS-A, shark cartilage CS-C, shark cartilage CS-D, and squid cartilage CS-E were purchased from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). These CS isoforms were all highly purified, protein-free preparations (total nitrogen, 2.1-2.8%), which were isolated according to Meyer's method (12.Meyer K. Chaffee E. J. Biol.

The conditioned media recovered from confluent cultures were centrifuged, sterilized by filtration through 0.2-μm filters, and mixed 1: 1 with normal growth medium before addition to cells. Immunoblotting—Cells grown in 60-mm dishes were treated with 2 ml of conditioned media for the indicated periods. When cells were treated with recombinant mouse Wnt-3a, cells grown in 35-mm dishes were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and incubated in 1 ml of serum-free DMEM containing recombinant mouse Wnt-3a. After cells were treated with Wnt-3a, they were washed with PBS, harvested, lysed in 200 μl of PBS containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-H (Peptide Institute, Inc., Osaka, Japan), and protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), and allowed to stand at 4 °C for 5 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and the resulting supernatants were further centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The second resulting supernatants were mixed with 100 μl of 3× SDS loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. The protein concentration of each sample was determined by a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA). Each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% gel), transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose filters (GE Healthcare), and analyzed by the standard procedure (14.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.60-18.66Google Scholar) with an ECL Advance™ Western blotting detection kit (GE Healthcare). Digestion of CS was carried out by treating cultured L cells with 10 mIU of chondroitinase ABC prepared in growth media for 90 min at 37 °C. Before use, chondroitinase ABC was mixed with protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) and then added to cultured cells. Control cultures were incubated with growth media in the absence of chondroitinase ABC. L cells digested by chondroitinase ABC were further treated with L-Wnt-3a-conditioned media in the presence of 10 mIU of chondroitinase ABC. Immunofluorescence—Cells cultured on 13-mm slide glasses (Matsunami Glass Ind., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) were fixed with PBS containing 4% p-formaldehyde for 10 min on ice and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were reacted with an anti-β-catenin antibody (diluted 50-fold with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed and incubated with 4 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature. They were washed again and counterstained with Hoechst 33258. Immunofluorescence was visualized on an all-in-one type fluorescence microscope BZ-8000 (Keyence, Osaka, Japan). Isolation and Purification of GAGs—Cells were homogenized in acetone, extracted with acetone three times, and air-dried thoroughly. The dried materials were digested with heat-activated actinase E (10% by weight of dried materials) in 0.1 m borate-sodium, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm CaCl2 at 55 °C for 24 h. The samples were adjusted to 5% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged. The resultant supernatants were extracted with diethyl ether three times to remove trichloroacetic acid. The aqueous phase containing 5% sodium acetate was adjusted to 80% ethanol and left overnight at -30 °C. The resultant precipitate was dissolved in 50 mm pyridine acetate, pH 5.0, and subjected to gel filtration on a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) using 50 mm pyridine acetate, pH 5.0, as an eluent. The flow-through fractions were collected and evaporated to dryness. Disaccharide Composition Analysis of CS and HS—Purified GAGs were digested with 5 mIU of chondroitinase ABC or a mixture of 0.5 mIU of heparinase and 0.5 mIU of heparitinase at 37 °C for 3 h. Reactions were terminated by boiling for 1 min. The digests were derivatized with a fluorophore 2-aminobenzamide and then analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography as reported previously (15.Kitagawa H. Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Biacore Analysis—Various GAG isoforms were biotinylated to couple to a streptavidin-coated sensor chip (Sensor Chip SA®) as described previously (16.Nandini C.D. Mikami T. Ohta M. Itoh N. Akiyama-Nambu F. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50799-50809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, GAG was dissolved in 100 mm MES-NaOH, pH 5.5, at a concentration of 2 mg/ml. To this solution were added 25 μg of biotin-LC-hydrazide freshly dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and 62.5 μg of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (Pierce) dissolved in 0.1 m MES-NaOH, pH 5.5. The mixture was incubated overnight at room temperature with continuous shaking. Excess biotinylating reagents were removed using Ultra-free®-MC (5000 NMWL filter unit) (Millipore, Billerica, MA) against several changes of phosphate-buffered saline. Sensor-Chip SA® was washed with 1 m NaCl at a flow rate of 30 μl/min according to the manufacturer's instructions. Biotinylated GAGs diluted in HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4) were perfused and allowed to interact with the surface of the sensor at a flow rate of 30 μl/min, until binding of biotinylated samples to the surface of the sensor reached 500-1,000 resonance units. Kinetic analyses were performed using a range of recombinant mouse Wnt-3a concentrations (15, 20, 25, 30, and 40 nm) at 30 μl/min. Wnt-3a was applied to the sensor chip (30 μl/min) for 2 min and left to dissociate for 3 min. Surfaces were regenerated using 1 m NaCl. Data were analyzed by BIAevaluation 3.0 software using a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. Visualization of Wnt-3a Binding to Cell Surface—Visualization of Wnt-3a trapped on the cell surface was carried out as described previously (17.Jiao X. Billings P.C. O'Connell M.P. Kaplan F.S. Shore E.M. Glaser D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1080-1086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Recombinant mouse Wnt-3a (4.8 ng) was incubated with rabbit anti-Wnt-3a antibody (20 ng) for 30 min at room temperature. Wnt-3a-anti-Wnt-3a antibody complexes were added to cells, incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, and then washed with PBS. After cells were fixed with acetone, they were incubated with 2 μg/ml of Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) for 60 min at room temperature. Immunofluorescence was visualized on an all-in-one type fluorescence microscope BZ-8000 (Keyence, Osaka, Japan). sog9 Cells Deficient in EXT1 and C4ST-1 Show a Diminished Response to Wnt-3a—To examine whether Wnt-3a signaling is regulated by CS-PGs in mouse fibroblast L cells as well as chondrocytes (9.Shortkroff S. Yates K.E. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2007; 15: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the effects of removing CS chains using chondroitinase ABC on Wnt-3a signaling were examined by measuring the stabilization of β-catenin in L cells as a direct response to canonical Wnt stimulation. Digestion of L cells with chondroitinase ABC significantly suppressed Wnt-3a signaling (Fig. 1A, lanes 5-8). These results show that CS-PGs also play important roles in Wnt-3a signaling in L cells. Thus, we tried to find out structural features of CS required for the modulation of Wnt-3a signaling by taking advantage of mouse L cell fibroblasts and their mutant sog9 cells defective in the expression of EXT1 and C4ST-1. These two cells were stimulated with conditioned media from L-Wnt-3a cells, a mouse fibroblast cell line that is stably transfected with Wnt-3a cDNA (18.Shibamoto S. Higano K. Takada R. Ito F. Takeichi M. Takada S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), for the indicated periods (Fig. 1A). Accumulation of β-catenin in the cytosol is indicative of the activation of canonical Wnt signaling, because degradation of β-catenin is inhibited by Wnt-3a signals. β-Catenin in unstimulated L and sog9 cells was scarcely detected (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 9). Two hours or later after treatment of L cells with L-Wnt-3a-conditioned media (L-Wnt-3a CM), accumulation of β-catenin was observed (Fig. 1A, lanes 2-4). Compared with the response of L cells to L-Wnt-3a CM, sog9 cells responded more weakly to L-Wnt-3a CM (Fig. 1A, lanes 10-12). Accumulation of β-catenin gradually increased (Fig. 1A, lanes 10-12) and reached the maximum response at around 4 h in sog9 cells (Fig. 1A, lane 11). In addition, chondroitinase ABC treatment diminished Wnt-3a signaling in sog9 cells as in the case of L cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 13-16), suggesting that CS chains synthesized in sog9 cells also partly contribute to Wnt-3a signaling. In addition, responses of L and sog9 cells to Wnt-3a became similar after digestion with chondroitinase ABC (Fig. 1A, lanes 5-8 and 13-16). Stabilized β-catenin in the cytosol by Wnt signaling is subsequently translocated to the nucleus (6.Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). After L and sog9 cells were treated with L-Wnt-3a CM for 6 h, these cells were stained with an anti-β-catenin antibody (Fig. 1B). As expected, when L cells were stimulated with L-Wnt-3a CM, accumulation of β-catenin in the cytosol and nuclei was clearly detected (Fig. 1B, panel e). In addition, a low level of β-catenin in sog9 cells treated with L-Wnt-3a CM was observed (Fig. 1B, panel g). In contrast, fluorescent signals representing β-catenin were hardly observed in L and sog9 cells in the absence of Wnt-3a (Fig. 1B, panels a and c). These results together indicate that susceptibility of sog9 cells to Wnt-3a decreases compared with that of L cells. Introduction of C4ST-1 into sog9 Cells Rescues the Reduced Response to Wnt-3a—As described, synthesis of both HS and CS was prominently suppressed in sog9 cells because of the deficiency of EXT-1 and C4ST-1 (10.Uyama T. Ishida M. Izumikawa T. Trybala E. Tufaro F. Bergstrom T. Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38668-38674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 19.Banfield B.W. Leduc Y. Esford L. Schubert K. Tufaro F. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3290-3298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, we examined whether Wnt-3a signaling in sog9 cells was affected by the resumption of HS biosynthesis. Biosynthesis of HS was recovered in sog9-EXT1 cells stably transfected with EXT1 (Table 2); nevertheless, the response of sog9-EXT1 cells to Wnt-3a was not restored (Fig. 2A). Second, we investigated whether the introduction of C4ST-1 into sog9 cells could enhance the response to Wnt-3a signaling. C4ST-1 is involved in the biosynthesis of CS and transfers a sulfate to the 4-O-position of a Gal-NAc residue in CS chains (20.Hiraoka N. Nakagawa H. Ong E. Akama T.O. Fukuda M.N. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20188-20196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 21.Yamauchi S. Mita S. Matsubara T. Fukuta M. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8975-8981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As described previously (10.Uyama T. Ishida M. Izumikawa T. Trybala E. Tufaro F. Bergstrom T. Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38668-38674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we have established two stable clones with different expression levels of C4ST-1 introduced (sog9-C4ST-1-1 (high expression) and sog9-C4ST-1-5 (low expression) cells). Between the two stable clones, differences in disaccharide composition and the amount of CS were observed, corresponding to the difference in the expression levels of introduced C4ST-1 (Table 3) (10.Uyama T. Ishida M. Izumikawa T. Trybala E. Tufaro F. Bergstrom T. Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38668-38674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Notably, the proportion of ΔDi-diSE unit in sog9-C4ST-1-1 cells was higher than that in L cells (Table 3). As shown in Fig. 2B, the response to Wnt-3a was fully restored. Interestingly, compared with sog9-C4ST-1-1 cells, sog9-C4ST-1-5 cells showed an attenuated response to Wnt-3a, suggesting that the expression level of C4ST-1 correlates with a canonical Wnt signal. These results indicate that 4-O-sulfation of CS formed by C4ST-1 or the expression of C4ST-1 protein itself may be one of the determinants of Wnt-3a signaling. C4ST-2 and D4ST-1 were also identified as sulfotransferases involved in 4-O-sulfation of GalNAc residues in CS. When C4ST-2 or D4ST-1 was introduced into sog9 cells, total amounts of CS and the contents of ΔDi-4S and ΔDi-diSE units were similar to those in parental sog9 cells (10.Uyama T. Ishida M. Izumikawa T. Trybala E. Tufaro F. Bergstrom T. Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38668-38674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, Wnt-3a signaling in sog9 cells was hardly affected by introducing C4ST-2 or D4ST-1 (not shown); therefore, these results suggest that the response to Wnt-3a is specifically regulated by C4ST-1.TABLE 2Disaccharide composition of HS from L and sog9-hEXT1 cellsCompositionL cellssog9-hEXT1 cellspmol/mg (mol %)pmol/mg (mol %)ΔDiHS-0S524.8 ± 42.4 (40.0)452.4 ± 39.4 (40.8)ΔDiHS-6S96.7 ± 6.4 (7.4)95.5 ± 5.5 (8.6)ΔDiHS-NS437.2 ± 52.1 (33.2)353.7 ± 30.3 (31.9)ΔDiHS-diS165.6 ± 16.9 (4.9)42.3 ± 6.1 (3.8)ΔDiHS-diS2100.4 ± 35.1 (7.7)96.1 ± 14.3 (8.6)ΔDiHS-triS89.5 ± 13.0 (6.8)69.2 ± 6.4 (6.3)Total1314.3 ± 126.91109.2 ± 88.3 Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Disaccharide composition of CS from L, sog9, sog9-C4ST-1-1, and sog9-C4ST-1-5 cellsCompositionL cellssog9 cellssog9-C4ST-1-1 cellssog9-C4ST-1-5 cellspmol/mg (mol %)pmol/mg (mol %)pmol/mg (mol %)pmol/mg (mol %)ΔDi-0S50.1 ± 13.8 (16)70.3 ± 9.1 (61)49.8 ± 0.8 (16)78.0 ± 9.0 (48)ΔDi-6S7.8 ± 6.9 (2)13.2 ± 2.1 (11)11.8 ± 0.3 (4)13.6 ± 0.9 (8)ΔDi-4S237.9 ± 19.8 (75)31.5 ± 3.9 (27)222.9 ± 5.7 (72)65.7 ± 7.1 (40)ΔDi-diSDNDaND indicates not detected.NDNDNDΔDi-diSE23.5 ± 4.2 (7)0.8 ± 0.1 (1)25.9 ± 2.1 (8)6.3 ± 1.3 (4)Total319.5 ± 32.5115.8 ± 8.8310.4 ± 7.5163.6 ± 15.2a ND indicates not detected. Open table in a new tab Wnt-3a Binds to Chondroitin Sulfate E with High Affinity—Because the augmentation of Wnt-3a signals was closely associated with the expression of C4ST-1, we examined the interaction of Wnt-3a with various CS isoforms using Biacore to get more information about the structures involved in Wnt-3a binding. As mentioned, the backbone structure of CS chains is composed of repeating disaccharide units, consisting of GlcUA and GalNAc. Differences in the sulfation of these units give rise to a variety of structural units. The major forms of CS are CS-A, CS-C, CS-D, and CS-E, which predominantly contain the A-unit (GlcUAβ1-3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate)), the C-unit (GlcUAβ1-3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate)), the D-unit (GlcUA(2-O-sulfate)β1-3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate)), and the E-unit (GlcUAβ1-3GalNAc(4,6-O-sulfate)), respectively (see Table 1). Although the CS isoforms used in this study are derived from marine sources, and the differential arrangement of these units is observed in various organisms, they are thought to mimic some of the activities expressed by mammalian CS chains. C4ST-1 synthesizes structures containing 4-O-sulfated GalNAc residues such as GlcUAβ1-3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate) and GlcUAβ1-3GalNAc(4,6-O-sulfate), which are frequently found in CS-A and CS-E, respectively (Table 1). Wnt-3a strongly bound to CS-E (Kd = 13.2 nm) (Fig. 3A and Table 4), whereas the other CS isoforms, even CS-A with a high 4-O-sulfated GalNAc content (Table 1), hardly interacted with Wnt-3a (Table 4). Notably, CS-D from shark cartilage, known as another over-sulfated CS that is characterized by a predominance of D-unit (GlcUA(2-O-sulfate)β1-3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate)), scarcely bound to Wnt-3a, suggesting that Wnt-3a recognizes a specific sulfation pattern. Although heparin, so-called over-sulfated HS, also interacted with Wnt-3a (Fig. 3B and Table 4), it is formed in particular tissues or cells such as granules of connective tissue-type mast cells (22.Forsberg E. Pejler G. Ringvall M. Lunderius C. Tomasini-Johansson B. Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Ledin J. Hellman L. Kjellen L.

https://openalex.org/W2101553633,"Recent reports suggested that Delta1, 4 and Jagged1, 2 possessed the ability to instruct CD4(+) T cell into selection of Th1 or Th2 fates, respectively, although the underlying mechanism endowing the cleaved Notch receptor with memory of ligand involved in its activation remains elusive. To examine this, we prepared artificial antigen-presenting cells expressing either DLL1 or Jag1. Although both ligands were efficient in inducing Notch2 cleavage and activation in CD4(+) T or reporter cells, the presence of Lunatic Fringe in CD4(+) T cells inhibited Jag1 activation of Notch1 receptor. Neither ligand could induce Th1 or Th2 fate choice independently of cytokines or redirect cytokine-driven Th1 or Th2 development. Instead, we find that Notch ligands only augment cytokine production during T cell differentiation in the presence of polarizing IL-12 and IL-4. Moreover, the differentiation choices of naïve CD4(+) T cells lacking gamma-secretase, RBP-J, or both in response to polarizing cytokines revealed that neither presenilin proteins nor RBP-J were required for cytokine-induced Th1/Th2 fate selection. However, presenilins facilitate cellular proliferation and cytokine secretion in an RBP-J (and thus, Notch) independent manner. The controversies surrounding the role of Notch and presenilins in Th1/Th2 polarization may reflect their role as genetic modifiers of T-helper cells differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2075521951,"To elucidate the heme acquisition system in pathogenic bacteria, we investigated the heme-binding properties of the third NEAT domain of IsdH (IsdH-NEAT3), a receptor for heme located on the surfaces of pathogenic bacterial cells, by using x-ray crystallography, isothermal titration calorimetry, examination of absorbance spectra, mutation analysis, size-exclusion chromatography, and analytical ultracentrifugation. We found the following: 1) IsdH-NEAT3 can bind with multiple heme molecules by two modes; 2) heme was bound at the surface of IsdH-NEAT3; 3) candidate residues proposed from the crystal structure were not essential for binding with heme; and 4) IsdH-NEAT3 was associated into a multimeric heme complex by the addition of excess heme. From these observations, we propose a heme-binding mechanism for IsdH-NEAT3 that involves multimerization and discuss the biological importance of this mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2020232598,"Background Oxidative stress is a probable cause of aging and associated diseases. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) originate mainly from endogenous sources, namely the mitochondria. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed the effect of aerobic metabolism on oxidative damage in Schizosaccharomyces pombe by global mapping of those genes that are required for growth on both respiratory-proficient media and hydrogen-peroxide-containing fermentable media. Out of a collection of approximately 2700 haploid yeast deletion mutants, 51 were sensitive to both conditions and 19 of these were related to mitochondrial function. Twelve deletion mutants lacked components of the electron transport chain. The growth defects of these mutants can be alleviated by the addition of antioxidants, which points to intrinsic oxidative stress as the origin of the phenotypes observed. These respiration-deficient mutants display elevated steady-state levels of ROS, probably due to enhanced electron leakage from their defective transport chains, which compromises the viability of chronologically-aged cells. Conclusion/Significance Individual mitochondrial dysfunctions have often been described as the cause of diseases or aging, and our global characterization emphasizes the primacy of oxidative stress in the etiology of such processes."
https://openalex.org/W2142545346,"Vaccination with Plasmodium falciparum MSP142/complete Freund's adjuvant (FA) followed by MSP142/incomplete FA is the only known regimen that protects Aotus nancymaae monkeys against infection by erythrocytic stage malaria parasites. The role of adjuvant is not defined; however complete FA cannot be used in humans. In rodent models, immunity is strain-specific. We vaccinated Aotus monkeys with the FVO or 3D7 alleles of MSP142 expressed in Escherichia coli or with the FVO allele expressed in baculovirus (bv) combined with complete and incomplete FA, Montanide ISA-720 (ISA-720) or AS02A. Challenge with FVO strain P. falciparum showed that suppression of cumulative day 11 parasitemia was strain-specific and could be induced by E. coli expressed MSP142 in combination with FA or ISA-720 but not with AS02A. The coli42-FVO antigen induced a stronger protective effect than the bv42-FVO antigen, and FA induced a stronger protective effect than ISA-720. ELISA antibody (Ab) responses at day of challenge (DOC) were strain-specific and correlated inversely with c-day 11 parasitemia (r = −0.843). ELISA Ab levels at DOC meeting a titer of at least 115,000 ELISA Ab units identified the vaccinees not requiring treatment (noTx) with a true positive rate of 83.3% and false positive rate of 14.3 %. Correlation between functional growth inhibitory Ab levels (GIA) and cumulative day 11 parasitemia was weaker (r = −0.511), and was not as predictive for a response of noTx. The lowest false positive rate for GIA was 30% when requiring a true positive rate of 83.3%. These inhibition results along with those showing that antigen/FA combinations induced a stronger protective immunity than antigen/ISA-720 or antigen/AS02 combinations are consistent with protection as ascribed to MSP1-specific cytophilic antibodies. Development of an effective MSP142 vaccine against erythrocytic stage P. falciparum infection will depend not only on antigen quality, but also upon the selection of an optimal adjuvant component."

Ycf1p is subject to complex regulation to ensure its optimal function. Previous studies showed that Ycf1p activity is stimulated by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Tus1p, and is positively regulated by phosphorylation in its ABC core domain at residues Ser-908 and Thr-911. Here we provide evidence that phosphorylation of Ser-251 in the Ycf1p N-terminal extension negatively regulates activity.

To identify kinase(s) that negatively regulate Ycf1p function, we conducted an integrated membrane yeast two-hybrid (iMYTH) screen and identified two kinase genes, CKA1 and HAL5, deletion of which increases Ycf1p function.

First, many of them have the unique ability to transport substrates in the form of glutathione conjugates or complexes (4.Haimeur A. Conseil G. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Curr. Drug Metab. 2004; 5: 21-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 6.Borst P. Elferink R.O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 537-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). Second, whereas all ABC transporters contain an ABC “core” domain (two membrane-spanning domains (MSDs) and two NBDs connected by a cytosolic domain; see Fig. 1A), a hallmark of the ABCC subfamily is that most of its members contain a significant N-terminal extension (NTE) (4.Haimeur A.

Biochem. 2002; 71: 537-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). The NTE comprises five membrane spans (MSD0) and a cytosolic loop (L0) (Fig. 1A). We and others have shown that MSD0 plays a role in localization for yeast and human MRPs and that the L0 is required for transport function (7.Bakos E. Evers R. Calenda G. Tusnady G.E. Szakacs G.

It has also been proposed that L0 plays a key role in dimerization of MRP1, which in turn is important for protein function (15.Yang Y. Liu Y. Dong Z. Xu J. Peng H. Liu Z. Zhang J.T. J. Biol.

As the importance of the ABCC transporters in detoxification and drug resistance becomes evident, a better understanding of how the function of ABCC proteins is regulated in vivo will be important. For ABCC7 (CFTR), phosphorylation of sites within the “R” domain of the ABC core has been suggested to positively and negatively regulate chloride channel function (18.Chappe V. Hinkson D.A. Zhu T.

To date, phosphorylation for other members of the ABCC subfamily of mammalian transporters has not been reported.To examine whether phosphorylation can regulate the activity of a prototypical ABCC transporter, we used Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast represent a highly tractable system for genetic and biochemical analysis of transporters. The best studied ABCC subfamily member in yeast is Ycf1p (Fig. 1A) (9.Mason D.L. Michaelis S. Mol.

Ycf1 resides on the vacuolar membrane and detoxifies yeast of xenobiotics, including heavy metals (cadmium, lead, mercury, arsenite), oxidants (diamide), and endogenous toxins (the intermediate in the adenine biosynthesis pathway that is glutathione conjugated and accumulates in an ade2 mutant) (24.Li Z.S.

However, the highly hydrophobic nature of transmembrane proteins such as Ycf1p complicates the use of these standard methods (36.Iyer, K., Burkle, L., Auerbach, D., Thaminy, S., Dinkel, M., Engels, K., and Stagljar, I.

We recently reported the development of iMYTH, a modified version of the split ubiquitin membrane yeast two-hybrid system, showing that it is a powerful method for identifying physiological regulators of membrane proteins such as the ABC transporters (34.Paumi C.M.

Sci. 2002; 27: 559-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Using iMYTH in a library screening format, we identified potential Ycf1p interaction partners. One of these, Tus1p, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTPase Rho1p, is a Rho1p-dependent positive regulator of Ycf1p transport activity both in vivo and in an in vitro transport assay (34.Paumi C.M.

In the present study, we have extended our iMYTH analysis of Ycf1p and identified two kinases that appear to function as negative regulators of Ycf1p, discussed in detail below.An important resource for yeast researchers is a growing number of large scale proteomic studies aimed at identifying the yeast “phospho-proteome.” We found that Ycf1p is among the vast repertoire of yeast phosphoproteins reported in three separate high throughput studies (38.Li X.

Burke D.J. Troyanskaya O.G. Hunt D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 2193-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). These studies have variously reported that two, three, or four residues within the ABC core domain of Ycf1p are phosphorylated, including Ser-903, Ser-908, Thr-911, and Ser-914. Strong experimental evidence indicates that phosphorylation of Ser-908 and Thr-911 plays a positive role in regulating Ycf1p function, because mutation of either residue to alanine results in almost complete loss of transporter activity, whereas mutation to glutamate to mimic phosphorylation restores activity (26.Szczypka M.S. Wemmie J.A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22853-22857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Eraso P. Martinez-Burgos M. Falcon-Perez J.M. Portillo F. Mazon M.J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). One additional phosphorylated residue in Ycf1p, Ser-251, was reported in two of the high throughput studies (39.Smolka M.B. Albuquerque C.P. Chen S.H. Zhou H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 10364-10369Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 40.Chi A. Huttenhower C. Geer L.Y. Coon J.J. Syka J.E. Bai D.L.

Notably, Ser-251 lies outside of the ABC core and is within the L0 domain of the NTE of Ycf1p. Because L0 is required for Ycf1p transport activity, and the analogous region in mammalian MRP1 has been implicated in the binding of reduced glutathione (GSH) and an MRP1 substrate (leukotriene C4) as well as in influencing dimerization, an interesting possibility is that phosphorylation of Ser-251 may directly regulate Ycf1p function.Here we have examined the issue of whether phosphorylation within the NTE regulates Ycf1p function. Surprisingly, our results suggest that phosphorylation of the NTE at Ser-251 negatively regulates Ycf1p function, in contrast to the positive regulation observed for phosphorylation of the ABC core region at Ser-908 and Thr-911. We also identified two kinase genes (CKA1 and HAL5) among the Ycf1p iMYTH interactors. Ycf1p transport activity is increased in cka1Δ and hal5Δ mutants, as compared with a WT strain, in a Ycf1p-dependent manner. Further genetic evidence suggests that Cka1p might negatively regulate Ycf1p function through phosphorylation of Ser-251. These experiments, together with previous studies, suggest that the transport function of Ycf1p is intricately controlled, as it is subject to both positive and negative regulation by phosphorylation, and involves distinct regions of the protein, the ABC core, and NTE, respectively.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1.

The single deletions Δhal5::KanMX and Δcka1::KanMX in the BY4741 background were obtained from the MATa yeast genome deletion collection (Open Biosystems). We confirmed the replacement of each gene with the KanMX cassette by standard PCR using a forward primer within the KanMX cassette and a reverse primer within the 3′ region of each gene. Each confirmed deletion was given an SM strain designation (SM5509 and SM5510) to signify that the appropriate genotype was confirmed. A PCR product containing the URA3 coding sequence flanked by 60 bp of homology to the 5′ upstream and 3′ downstream coding sequence of YCF1 was gel-purified according to the manufacturer's directions (Qiagen), transformed into SM5509 (Δhal5::KanMX) and SM5510 (Δcka1::KanMX), and double disruptants were selected on SC-URA G418-containing plates, yielding strains SM5515 and SM5516, respectively.Plasmids—Plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 2. Phosphorylation site mutants of Ycf1p were created in the starting plasmid pSM1753 (2μ YCF1-GFP URA3) using standard PCR-mediated mutagenesis (Stratagene QuikChange II-XL). In brief, primers harboring the mutation of interest were designed using the QuikChange Web site primer design program (Stratagene), and PCR-mediated mutagenesis was carried out. The product of the PCR reaction was digested for 1–3 h with DpnI. A 10-μl aliquot of the DpnI digest was ligated (Takara Co.) and transformed into the DH5α bacterial cloning strain. DH5α clones containing mutant plasmid constructs were selected on LB agar plates containing carbenicillin, purified, and sequenced for verification, which resulted in the creation of pSM2243, pSM2244, and pSM2245, containing S251A, S251E, and S908A,T911A, respectively. To construct the YCF1 triple mutant, S251A,S908A,T911A, a restriction fragment containing the S251A mutation from pSM2243 was co-transformed with linearized pSM2245 into yeast, and homologous recombination generated the recombinant plasmid pSM2246.TABLE 2Plasmid used in this studyPlasmidRelevant genotypeReferencepSM1753[2μ YCF1-GFP URA3]Mason et al.

These proteins are of interest in developing an enzyme to deglycate proteins implicated in diabetic complications. We report here the crystal structures of FAOX-II from the fungi Aspergillus fumigatus, in free form and in complex with the inhibitor fructosyl-thioacetate, at 1.75 and 1.6Å resolution, respectively. FAOX-II is a two domain FAD-enzyme with an overall topology that is most similar to that of monomeric sarcosine oxidase. Active site residues Tyr-60, Arg-112 and Lys-368 bind the carboxylic portion of the fructosamine, whereas Glu-280 and Arg-411 bind the fructosyl portion. From structure-guided sequence comparison, Glu-280 was identified as a signature residue for FAOX activity. Two flexible surface loops become ordered upon binding of the inhibitor in a catalytic site that is about 12Å deep, providing an explanation for the very low activity of FAOX enzymes toward protein-bound fructosamines, which would have difficulty accessing the active site. Structure-based mutagenesis showed that substitution of Glu-280 and Arg-411 eliminates enzyme activity. In contrast, modification of other active site residues or of amino acids in the flexible active site loops has little effect, highlighting these regions as potential targets in designing an enzyme that will accept larger substrates.

Fructosamines are formed by condensation of glucose with the amino group of amino acids or proteins. Fructosamines are formed spontaneously, i.e. non-enzymatically, at a rate that depends on temperature, sugar anomerization rate, concentration, and turnover rate of the target proteins. In medicine, protein-bound fructosamines (also named glycated proteins) have attracted much attention since their formation is increased in diabetes and taken to be in part responsible for diabetic complications. Fructosamines are relatively unstable compounds and are precursors for advanced glycation end products (AGEs), 5The abbreviations used are: AGE, advanced glycation end product; FAOX, fructosamine oxidase; SeMet, selenomethionine; FSA, fructosyl thio-acetate; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; MSOX, monomeric sarcosine oxidase. some of which cause proteins cross-linking, extracellular matrix stiffening, and activation of the receptor for AGEs (RAGEs) (1.Monnier V.M.

As an example, the fructosamine-derived lysine-arginine cross-link glucosepane is to date the single major cross-link known to accumulate in human collagen in diabetes and aging (3.Sell D.R.

Several years ago our laboratory initiated a search for deglycating enzymes in soil organisms with the goal of finding enzymes that could deglycate proteins. In doing so we found enzymes with “amadoriase” activity toward low molecular weight substrates in soil samples, first in Pseudomonas sp. (4.Saxena A.K. Saxena P. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32803-32809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and later in Aspergillus fumigatus (5.Takahashi M. Pischetsrieder M. Monnier V.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The latter turned out to have similar properties with the enzyme first published by Horiuchi et al. (8.Horiuchi T. Kurokawa T. Sati N. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1989; 53: 103-110Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar) under the name fructose amino acid oxidase (EC 1.5.3). Considerable work has since been published on these enzymes, which we are referring to in this work under the generic name fructosamine oxidases (FAOX). In addition to FAOX enzymes, two different families of enzymes acting on fructosamines have been identified: fructosamine 3-kinases (found in mammals and birds) and fructoselysine-6-phosphate deglycase, which acts in functional association with fructoselysine-6-kinase (found in bacteria) (9.Delpierre G.

Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42523-42529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). All these enzymes ultimately catalyze the detachment of the sugar moiety from the amine of the fructosamine, leading to its “deglycation.” Those three families of enzymes use different catalytic mechanisms and have different physiological roles; fructosamine 3-kinase is an ATP-dependent protein-repair enzyme that clears fructosamines as they form on proteins in the cell, whereas the members of the last two families, fructoselysine-6-phosphate deglycase and FAOX, are microbial enzymes enabling the utilization of glycated amino acids as energy source. Fungal FAOXs are peroxisomal enzymes containing covalently bound FAD and catalyze the oxidation of the C-N bond between the nitrogen of the amino portion of the fructosamines and C1 of the fructosyl moiety. The resulting Schiff base is readily hydrolyzed to glucosone and an amino acid. After reduction, the reduced FAD is oxidized by molecular oxygen with concomitant release of hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 1). Many fungal species contain more than one FAOX in their genomes, suggesting complementary roles. A. fumigatus contains two FAOXs; FAOX-I, which acts best on fructosyl-ϵ-lysine and fructosyl aminocaproate, and FAOX-II, which has more affinity for fructose-α-glycine (5.Takahashi M. Pischetsrieder M. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3437-3443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 6.Takahashi M. Pischetsrieder M. Monnier V.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). All FAOXs act best on glycated amino acids, and their activity decreases as the size of the fructosamine increases and is almost undetectable on glycated proteins. The lack of enzymatic activity of FAOX enzymes toward glycated proteins frustratingly prevented them from being utilized as tools to revert protein glycation in in vitro or animal models to study the pathological consequences of protein glycation in aging and diabetes. To understand and possibly overcome by protein engineering, the lack of activity of FAOX toward glycated protein, we have solved the high resolution crystal structures of FAOX-II from A. fumigatus in free and inhibitor-bound forms. Expression and Purification of FAOX-II—An overnight 200-ml pre-culture (37 °C, LB containing 50 mg/liter ampicillin and 25 mg/liter chloramphenicol) of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS carrying the expression plasmid of FAOX-II (6.Takahashi M. Pischetsrieder M. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12505-125057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was performed starting from a single freshly plated colony. 100 ml of this culture was used to inoculate 2 liters of LB medium containing 50 mg/liter ampicillin and 25 mg/liter chloramphenicol. Cells were grown at 37 °C under vigorous shaking until A600 reached 0.5, and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm; the culture was grown for an additional 4 h at 37°C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml hen egg lysozyme and submitted to three cycles of freezing and thawing. MgSO4 was added to a final concentration of 1 mm together with 20,000 units of DNase, and the preparation was incubated at 4 °C for 15 min before centrifugation at 16,000 rpm for 40 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was gently mixed with polyethylene glycol 6000 at a final concentration of 15% (w/v), and the preparation was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C to give a pellet that contained >95% of FAOX-II. Resuspension in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl was followed by dilution in buffer A (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 75 mm NaCl) to a final volume of 1100 ml before loading onto a 60-ml DEAE at 1.2 ml/min. The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer A, and the flow-through and washes, which contained FAOX-II, were collected. After adjusting the pH to 9.5 with 5 m NaOH, the volume was brought to 2000 ml by the addition of 800 ml of 25 mm Tris pH 9.5. The preparation was loaded on a 30-ml Q-Sepharose column at 5 ml/min, and the column was washed with 100 ml of buffer (25 mm Tris 8.0) before elution of proteins using a 300-ml gradient (0–100% B: 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl) at 2 ml/min. Fractions were collected, and A450 nm was monitored to identify the fractions with the most intense yellow color (eluted at 15–30% B). The pooled fractions (∼16 ml) were concentrated to 40 mg/ml, and buffer was exchanged into 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 10 mm NaCl, during which some protein precipitate formed and was removed by centrifugation. The final yield was 35 mg of pure protein with a specific activity of 3.3 units/mg using fructosyl-glycine as a substrate. Analysis of the Purity of FAOX-II—The final purified FAOX-II preparation showed a single band with an apparent mass of about 50 kDa by silver-stained SDS-PAGE. Dynamic light scattering analysis indicated that the sample was monodisperse and had an apparent mass of 47 kDa. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed one peak of mass 49,703 kDa, in excellent agreement with the calculated mass of a FAD-bound enzyme; no mass was observed at 48,931 kDa, expected for apoenzyme lacking FAD (the latter represented about 80% of FAOX-II in the bacterial crude extract and was removed during the purification). The A280/A450 ratio was 0.125, in good agreement with the calculated theoretical ratio of 0.124. Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis was performed using a Stratagene QuikChange kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutant proteins were expressed under the same conditions as the wild-type enzyme. The purification procedure was simplified and involved only the DEAE-Sepharose and the Q-Sepharose purifications steps. Purity of the mutant proteins was assayed by SDS-PAGE analysis using Coomassie Blue staining and was >70%. Expression and Purification of Selenomethionine FAOX-II— An overnight 200-ml pre-culture (37 °C, LB ampi-chloramphenicol) of bacteria E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS carrying the expression plasmid of FAOX-II was performed starting from a single freshly plated colony. The culture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of a minimal medium (27 g/liter Na2HPO4, 13.5 g/liter KH2PO4, 4.5 g/liter NH4Cl, 2.25 g/liter NaCl, 4.5 mm MgSO4, 18 g/liter glucose, 2.25 mg/liter thiamine, 125 mg Fe(II)SO4·7H2O) and the antibiotics ampicillin (to 50 mg/liter) and chloramphenicol (25 mg/liter). Two liters of minimal media were inoculated with 12 ml of this preparation, and the culture was grown at 37 °C under vigorous shaking until A600 reached 0.5; at this stage, 200 mg of lysine, 200 mg of phenylalanine, 200 mg of threonine, 100 mg of isoleucine, 100 mg of leucine, 100 mg of valine, and 100 mg of selenomethionine (SeMet) were added to the culture. After 20 min isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm and CoCl2 and ZnCl2 to 0.1 mm, and the culture was pursued for another 6 h. The preparation of the bacterial extract and the purification procedure were performed identically as for wild-type FAOX-II with the exception that 1 mm dithiothreitol was added to all buffers to prevent selenomethionine oxidation. This procedure allowed the preparation of 10 mg of pure SeMet-FAOX-II. Mass spectrometric analysis indicated that all eight methionine residues were replaced by selenomethionine (data not shown). Expression and Purification of FAOX-I—His-tagged FAOX-I from A. fumigatus was expressed and purified on a His-Trap column as described previously (7.Wu X. Takahashi M. Chen S.G. Monnier V.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Cryoprotection—Crystals of wild-type and selenomethionine FAOX-II were obtained by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C by mixing 1 μl of the protein solution (15 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0) in the presence or absence of a 3 mm concentration of the inhibitor fructosyl thioacetate (FSA) with 1 μl of the reservoir containing 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.4, 10% isopropanol, and 18% polyethylene glycol 4000. Crystals took 2 weeks to grow and are monoclinic, with space group P21, and contain 2 FAOX-II molecules in the asymmetric unit to give a calculated Matthews coefficient of 2.1 Å3/Da. SeMet crystals grew under the same conditions as the wild type and were isomorphous. Crystals with and without inhibitor grew under similar conditions but had different unit cell dimensions (Table 1); the smaller SeMet crystals had more regular morphology and were used for data collection. The crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.4, 20% isopropanol, 18% PEG 4000 and dunked in liquid nitrogen for data collection.TABLE 1Data collection, phasing, and refinement statistics Numbers in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.

An initial FAOX-II model automatically built by RESOLVE provided the starting point for iterative cycles of interactive model building carried out in COOT (15.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr.

The final refined model contained residues 3–57, 68–109, and 117–437 in molecule A, residues 3–57, 67–109, and 120–438 in molecule B, FAD cofactors in both molecules, and 842 waters. Diffraction data for FAOX-II bound to FSA were measured from a SeMet crystal. Data were measured at beamline X29 at the National Synchrotron Light Source and processed using HKL2000 (11.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) (Table 1). This structure was initially solved using the coordinates of the unbound FAOX-II. The final refined model of the FAOX-II includes residues 2–437 in molecule A, 2–438 in molecule B, FAD and FSA bound to both molecules, 926 waters, and a molecule of Hepes presumably from the crystallization mixture, bound to the surface of FAOX-II molecule B distant from the active site.

For synthesis of the inhibitor fructosyl-thioacetate (FSA), trifluoromethane sulfonic anhydride (300 mg, 1.1 mmol) was added into a solution of 2,3:4,5-di-O-isopropylidene-β-d-fructopyranose (260 mg, 1 mmol) in dichloromethane (10 ml). The resulting solution was stirred at room temperature for 1 h and evaporated under reduced pressure to give triflate 2 (see Scheme), which was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (5 ml). Methyl-thioglycate (106 mg, 1 mmol) and cesium carbonate (325 mg, 1 mmol) were added, and the resulting mixture was stirred for 0.5 h and evaporated. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (n-hexane/ethyl acetate 5/1) to give the ester 3 (260 mg, 74.7% yield), which was hydrolyzed by lithium hydroxide (9.5 mg, 4 mmol) in isopropanol/water (1:1, 5 ml) to give 4. The final product 1 was achieved by deprotection of 4 in TFA/water (4:1) at room temperature. Glycated bovine serum albumin and glycated histones were prepared as described previously (9.Delpierre G. Rider M.H. Collard F. Stroobant V. Vanstapel F. Santos H. Van Schaftingen E. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1627-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Enzymatic Assays—FAOX activity was measured as previously described by following the formation of hydrogen peroxide using the Amplex Red peroxidase assay (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions (7.Wu X. Takahashi M. Chen S.G. Monnier V.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, FAOX was incubated with the appropriate concentration of fructosamine in the presence of horseradish peroxidase (0.02 milliunits) and 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (50 μm) at 30 °C in a final volume of 200 μl, and fluorescence was detected at 590 nm using excitation at 540 nm in a microplate reader (Tecan Instrument). One unit of enzyme is defined as producing 1 mmol of hydrogen peroxide/min/mg of enzyme at 30 °C at a saturating concentration of the substrate. Previous attempts to obtain crystals from His-tagged FAOX-I (Amadoriase I) were fruitless, leading us to isolate and purify the non-tagged recombinant enzyme FAOX-II (Amadoriase II) instead. Crystals of FAOX-II in free form and bound to its FSA inhibitor grew under similar conditions, and their structures were determined to 1.75 and 1.6 Å resolution, respectively. The free FAOX-II and inhibitor-bound FAOX-II-FSA structures each have two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit. Superposition of the Cα atoms of the two molecules in FAOX-II gives an r.m.s.d. of 0.3 Å; a similar superposition for the FAOX-II-FSA complex crystal gives a 0.2-Å r.m.s.d., indicating that the two molecules in each crystal are in nearly identical conformations. In the free FAOX-II structure, no continuous electron density was seen for residues 58–66 and 110–116, revealing that in the absence of ligand bound in the active site, these two surface regions are flexible. Aside from the two flexible segments near the active site, the conformation of the rest of the enzyme is very similar in the presence and absence of inhibitor, as evidenced by a low r.m.s.d. value of 0.5 for superposition of the Cα atoms of the free and complexed FAOX-II-FSA (Figs. 2, A and B). Unless otherwise indicated, structural details in the following sections are provided for molecule A in the FAOX-II-FSA crystal and are similar in both FAOX-II and FAOX-II-FSA structures. FAOX-II is a two-domain protein belonging to the d-amino acid oxidase FAD-binding protein family. One domain contains a classic FAD binding motif that includes two β-sheets that are flanked by four α-helices on one side and consists of residues Ala-2—Gly-48, Ala-163—Ala-221, and Cys-335—Glu-382 (Figs. 2, A and B, in dark gray). The second, “catalytic” domain contains an 8-stranded mixed β-sheet that provides a curved wall of the active site substrate binding pocket, a long helix in a flap that covers the active site, and a second long helix at the periphery of the structure. An SSM structural homolog search (24.Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar) against the PDB data base identified monomeric sarcosine oxidase (MSOX, PDB code 1el9) from Bacillus subtilis, a protein sharing 18% sequence identity with FAOX-II (25.Trickey P. Wagner M.A. Jorns M.S. Mathews F.S. Structure. 1999; 7: 331-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), as the closest match, with an r.m.s.d. of 2.8 Å for 357 equivalent Cα atoms. The C-terminal 36 residues in FAOX-II form a loop over the substrate binding site which is missing in MSOX (Figs. 2, A and B, pink). l-Proline dehydrogenase (PDB code 1y56), glycine oxidase (PDB code 1ng3), the β chain of heterotetrameric sarcosine oxidase (PDB code 2gag), and N-methyl-l-tryptophan oxidase (PDB code 2apg) were also identified as structural homologs but share no significant sequence similarity with FAOX-II. Flavin Binding—The FAD is bound to FAOX-II similarly in the presence and absence of the FSA inhibitor and in a manner that is also similar to that seen in MSOX (Fig. 2C). The cofactor is in an extended conformation and is nearly completely encased in the enzyme. In the two independent molecules in the free and inhibitor-bound structures, the isoaloxazine ring varied from planar to slightly bent (by up to 10°). The covalent, hydrogen-bonding and electrostatic interactions between FAD and FAOX-II are summarized in Fig. 3A. These include one covalent bond to Cys-335, 21 hydrogen bonds of which 3 are to solvent molecules, and 2 helix dipoles. The positive end of one of the helices (residues 367–383) is directed toward the FAD N1 and O2 atoms, helping to stabilize the electron-rich character of the flavin ring; the positive end of the other dipole points toward the negatively charged pyrophosphate group of FAD and serves to stabilize/neutralize its charge. Arginine residues at positions 112, 343, and 411 and lysine residues at positions 53 and 368 contribute to a basic environment surrounding the FAD. Of particular interest is Lys-53, which approaches the si-side of the flavin aromatic ring; in MSOX, an Arg is found in the equivalent position. Lys-276 forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the flavin ring N5 atom. This interaction is also seen in MSOX and maize polyamine oxidase (PDB code 1b37), the latter of which has an unrelated protein fold. Glu-280 is the only acidic residue found in the flavin environment and is involved in hydrogen-bonding with the hydroxyl group of the fructosyl moiety of the inhibitor (see below). FSA Inhibitor Binding—Studies on MSOX successfully took advantage of the replacement of the nitrogen of the C-N bond of the substrate by sulfur, tellurium, or selenium in the design of inhibitors (25.Trickey P. Wagner M.A. Jorns M.S. Mathews F.S. Structure. 1999; 7: 331-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 26.Wagner M.A. Trickey P. Chen Z.W. Mathews F.S. Jorns M.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8813-8824Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We, therefore, synthesized an analog of fructosyl-glycine, the fructosamine for which FAOX-II displays the highest affinity, in which the α-nitrogen was replaced by a sulfur atom. This compound, FSA, was found to be a good competitive inhibitor with a Ki of 5 μm, i.e. ∼50-fold lower than the Km for fructosyl-glycine, without being a substrate of FAOX-II. Spectroscopic studies indicated that FSA formed a charge transfer species with FAOX, presumably due to the close proximity of the electron-rich sulfur of FSA and the flavin. The soaking of FAOX-II crystals in the presence of FSA caused their dissolution; co-crystallization was successfully used to obtain complex crystals. The FSA ligand could be located unambiguously on the re-side of the flavin ring (Figs. 2, B–D), with its fructosyl portion displaying a pyranose conformation, the most abundant form of fructosamines in solution (27.Tagami U. Akashi S. Mizukoshi T. Suzuki E. Hirayama K. J. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 35: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This finding confirms previous studies with stereospecific inhibitors adopting both furanose and pyranose conformations (28.Wu X. Chen S.G. Petrash J.M. Monnier V.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4453-4458Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The sulfur atom of the inhibitor, which would correspond to the nitrogen atom of a substrate, is 3.4 Å from C4α of FAD, whereas the adjacent carbon of the inhibitor, corresponding to the nascent imine carbon of a substrate, is 3.4 Å from N5 of FAD. Thus, the inhibitor appears to be bound in a position and orientation corresponding to a productive substrate binding mode. The interactions made by the ligand with the protein are summarized in Figs. 2B, 3B, and 4A and fall into three groups, those involving the inhibitor carboxylate, those involving the fructosyl group, and those forming a hydrophobic interface along one side of the inhibitor. The FSA carboxylate oxygens are hydrogen-bound to the side chains of Tyr-60, Arg-112, and Lys-368 and to two water molecules (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, the MSOX active site contains Tyr-55, Arg-52, and Lys-348 in similar positions (Fig. 4B). To address their possible importance for enzyme function, these three residues were mutated to impair their interactions with the carboxylic portion of the substrate. Mutation of Tyr-60 to Phe, Arg-112 to Glu, and Lys-368 to Met resulted in decreases of Km for fructosyl-glycine by 3-, 10-, and 5-fold, respectively, without changing the Vmax significantly (Table 2).TABLE 2Effect of amino acids substitution on kinetic properties of FAOX-II ND, not detecte"

To investigate whether Rpb4/7 is an integral part of DNA-associated Pol II in vivo, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to high resolution tiling microarray analysis. We show that the genome-wide occupancy profiles for Rpb7 and the core subunit Rpb3 are essentially identical. Thus, the complete Pol II associates with DNA in vivo, consistent with functional roles of Rpb4/7 throughout the transcription cycle."

We have isolated an approximately 58-kDa GroEL homolog, secreted in the culture medium through outer membrane vesicles. The protein was orally insecticidal to the major crop pest Helicoverpa armigera with an LC50 of approximately 3.6 microg/g diet. For optimal insecticidal activity all three domains of the protein, apical, intermediate, and equatorial, were necessary. The apical domain alone was able to bind to the larval gut membranes and manifest low level insecticidal activity. At equimolar concentrations, the apical domain contained approximately one-third and the apical-intermediate domain approximately one-half bioactivity of that of the full-length protein. Interaction of the protein with the larval gut membrane was specifically inhibited by N-acetylglucosamine and chito-oligosaccharides. Treatment of the larval gut membranes with chitinase abolished protein binding. Based on the three-dimensional structural model, mutational analysis demonstrated that surface-exposed residues Thr-347 and Ser-356 in the apical domain were crucial for both binding to the gut epithelium and insecticidal activity. Double mutant T347A,S356A was 80% less toxic (p < 0.001) than the wild type protein. The GroEL homolog showed alpha-chitin binding activity with Kd approximately 0.64 microm and Bmax approximately 4.68 micromol/g chitin. The variation in chitin binding activity of the mutant proteins was in good agreement with membrane binding characteristics and insecticidal activity. The less toxic double mutant XnGroEL showed an approximately 8-fold increase of Kd in chitin binding assay. Our results demonstrate that X. nematophila secretes an insecticidal GroEL protein with chitin binding activity."

N-Linked glycosylation involves the covalent attachment of a carbohydrate moiety to a protein at the amide nitrogen of an asparagine side chain in the consensus sequence Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr (1Weerapana E. Imperiali B. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Although the existence of archaeal glycoproteins was described more than 30 years ago (2Mescher M.F.

Chem. 1973; 248: 433-438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BacAc2 is initially synthesized as a uridine diphosphate (UDP) derivative. Gene products of the C. jejuni protein glycosylation (pgl) locus form the N-linked heptasaccharide biosynthetic pathway (3Szymanski C.M. Yao R. Ewing C.P. Trust T.J. Guerry P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1022-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), and knockouts of any enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of UDP-BacAc2 disrupts formation of the heptasaccharide (11Kelly J.

The biosynthesis of UDP-BacAc2 occurs by the sequential modification of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) at the C6 and C4 positions (Fig. 1). Initially, PglF, a membrane-bound protein and member of the short-chain dehydrogenase family of enzymes, conducts an NAD+-dependent dehydration at C6 to form UDP-2-acetamido-2, 6-dideoxy-α-d-xylo-hexulose (12Schoenhofen I.C. McNally D.J. Vinogradov E. Whitfield D. Young N.M. Dick S. Wakarchuk W.W. Brisson J.R. Logan S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The dehydration step results in formation of a ketone at C4, where PglE conducts a pyridoxal-5′-phosphate-dependent transamination using l-glutamate as the source of the transferred amine to form the UDP-4-amino-sugar (12Schoenhofen I.C. McNally D.J. Vinogradov E. Whitfield D. Young N.M. Dick S. Wakarchuk W.W. Brisson J.R. Logan S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). PglD, the focus of this study, then transfers an acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) to the C4 amine to form UDP-BacAc2 (13Olivier N.B. Chen M.M. Behr J.R. Imperiali B. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13659-13669Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Bioinformatic analysis shows that PglD contains a series of imperfect tandem repeats collectively known as a hexapeptide repeat motif (14Dicker I.B. Seetharam S. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15Vaara M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 76: 249-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pattern of the repeated unit generally conforms to the sequence (LIV)1, (GAED)2, X3, X4, (STAV)5, and X6. The first crystal structure solved of a protein containing this signature sequence was that of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine acetyltransferase (16Raetz C.R. Roderick S.L. Science. 1995; 270: 997-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The tertiary structure formed by residues in the hexapeptide repeat was shown to be a left-handed β helix. LβH enzymes that have been characterized biochemically are known to acylate substrates such as UDP-GlcNAc (17Anderson M.S. Bull H.G. Galloway S.M. Kelly T.M. Mohan S. Radika K. Raetz C.R. J. Biol.

The proposed mechanism of catalysis for LβH enzymes has been summarized in a review by Field and Naismith (21Field R.A. Naismith J.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7637-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, the substrate is activated by abstraction of a proton from either a hydroxyl group or a protonated primary amine by a side-chain functional group, usually the imidazole of histidine. The activated substrate then conducts a nucleophilic attack on the acetyl group of AcCoA, forming a tetrahedral intermediate which is followed by the subsequent release of the deacetylated coenzyme and product.Sequence alignments of PglD and other LβH proteins with existing crystal structures share ∼25% sequence similarity that is primarily localized to the LβH domain (data not shown). Sequences that align more favorably with the full-length PglD are proteins from a variety of pathogenic and non-pathogenic organisms (supplemental Fig. S1). Noteworthy among these are homologs found in the Neisseria bacterial species. PglB, a bifunctional transmembrane protein, has been implicated in the biosynthesis of a diacetyl-trideoxy hexose found O-linked to pilin from Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitides (22Aas F.E. Vik A. Vedde J. Koomey M. Egge-Jacobsen W. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 607-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Hegge F.T. Hitchen P.G. Aas F.E. Kristiansen H. Lovold C. Egge-Jacobsen W.

Another PglD homolog is NeuD from Mannheimia hemolytica and Streptococcus agalactiae. In S. agalactiae this protein is known to O-acetylate sialic acid and is required for capsular polysaccharide sialylation (24Lewis A.L. Hensler M.E. Varki A. Nizet V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11186-11192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).There have been several recent advances toward determining the three-dimensional structure of PglD. A crystal structure of PglD in the apo state has been solved by the Protein Structure Initiative. This structure has been made publicly available from the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org) under the identifier 2NPO (Fig. 2). Although analysis of the structure by the authors is pending publication, it can be seen that the crystal structure is unique and non-redundant, thus providing a valuable representation of other sequences. More recently, two other crystal structures of PglD were solved, one in the presence of citrate (3BFP) and the other in the presence of coenzyme A (2VHE) (25Rangarajan E.S. Ruane K.M. Sulea T. Watson D.C. Proteau A. Leclerc S. Cygler M. Matte A. Young N.M. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1827-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although lacking the critical acetyl group on coenzyme A, the authors combined structural analysis with functional assays on site-directed mutants to identify several residues lining the active site as important for catalysis. Moreover, computational and molecular modeling efforts were incorporated into the study resulting in a proposal for the mechanism of catalysis and a mode for binding of the sugar substrate to protein. Although previously modeled by computational methods, a crystal structure of the native sugar substrate would provide physical evidence for describing the mode of substrate binding. Furthermore, structural data that present the active site in dissimilar chemical environments may aid in understanding the function of specific residues during catalysis.FIGURE 2Crystal structure of PglD in the apo-state (2NPO).

The co-crystal structures of PglD in the presence of citrate, AcCoA, or the UDP-4-amino-sugar have been solved. Each structure shows a chemical environment in the active site that is distinct from that in the previously published crystal structures. Using sedimentation velocity AUC, we also show that PglD self-associates as a homotrimer in solution. Comparison of the structures reveals that the extreme C-terminal portion of the protein undergoes a coenzyme-dependent cis-trans amide bond isomerization between Val-190 and Pro-191, resulting in an interchange of coils between protomers in the biological assembly. Combining the results from structure and function experiments, we propose a detailed mechanism of catalysis for PglD in the formation of UDP-BacAc2 and discuss some of the implications for homologs in other pathogenic organisms.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Biology—The pglD gene was amplified from genomic DNA (ATCC 700819, designation NCTC 11168) as described elsewhere (13Olivier N.B. Chen M.M. Behr J.R. Imperiali B. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13659-13669Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The amplicon encoding the fulllength protein was engineered with the restriction sites NcoI and XhoI, then subcloned into the pETGQ vector (26Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13431-13436Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This vector was used to express constructs with a thrombin-cleavable octahistidine tag at the N terminus. Site-directed mutagenesis was accomplished using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol from Stratagene.Protein Expression and Purification—Heterologous expression was accomplished using the Escherichia coli BL-21 (DE3) strain (Stratagene). Cells were transformed with pETGQ-construct plasmids and grown to an A600 of ∼0.6 absorbance units at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani broth; the cultures were cooled to ∼16 °C and then induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Incorporation of selenomethionine was accomplished following a protocol described elsewhere (27Guerrero S.A. Hecht H.J. Hofmann B. Biebl H. Singh M. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 56: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Twenty hours after induction the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in ice-cold buffer composed of 50 mm HEPES, 10 mm imidazole, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.1, at 1/20 the original culture volume. Maintaining a working temperature of 4 °C, the cells were lysed by sonication, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation in a Type 45 Ti rotor (Beckman/Coulter) at 35,000 rpm. The construct was bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) in batch using 1 ml of resin per liter of culture, overnight with gentle tumbling. The protein-bound resin was washed with 25 column volumes of lysis buffer containing 60 mm imidazole, and the protein was eluted in lysis buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The octahistidine tag was removed by thrombinolysis, and after the digest reached completion, the reaction was diluted 10-fold with a buffer composed of 20 mm HEPES at pH 7.1. This solution was loaded onto an SP-Sepharose cation exchange column (GE Healthcare), and the protein eluted with a linear NaCl gradient. Fractions containing the isolated protein were pooled and concentrated to 5 mg/ml for further purification by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 XK16-60 column (GE Healthcare) in a running buffer of 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.1. Fractions containing monodispersed material were pooled, and this sample was used for AUC, crystallization, and function assays. MALDI-mass spectrometry was used to verify the molecular mass of purified material and detect incorporation of selenomethionine (data not shown).Sedimentation Velocity AUC—Experiments were conducted in an Optima XL-I ultracentrifuge (Beckman/Coulter) using an An60 Ti four-hole rotor at the Boston Biomedical Research Institute (Watertown, MA). Each experiment was conducted with the temperature in the centrifugation chamber at 37 °C and a rotor speed of 50,000 rpm. The centrifuge was retrofitted with a turbo diffusion pump, circumventing contamination of the optics with oil from the conventional diffusion pump when conducting experiments at temperatures above 25 °C. Data were acquired with the interference optics system using sapphire windows. Each cell assembly was composed of 12-mm double-sector Epon centerpieces with interference slit window holders (Biomolecular Interaction Technologies Center). Samples were dialyzed for 24 h in the gel-filtration running buffer before the experiment. Three sample cells were loaded, with each having a different concentration of PglD (70 ± 1, 25 ± 1, and 6 ± 1 μm) and analyzed in the centrifuge simultaneously. Data were analyzed with the software package SEDANAL (28Stafford W.F. Sherwood P.J. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 108: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and the program SEDNTERP was used to estimate the partial specific volume of the protein and density of the solvent.Crystallization and Data Collection—Protein solutions with UDP-4-amino-sugar or AcCoA were made such that the final concentration of the added substrate was 5 mm and were then incubated on ice for 1 h. The UDP-4-amino-sugar was enzymatically synthesized in vitro using the method previously described (13Olivier N.B. Chen M.M. Behr J.R. Imperiali B. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13659-13669Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The protein solution was concentrated and diluted three times with the filtrate using Amicon 10,000 Mr cut-off concentrators. Before setting up trays with sitting or hanging drops, the protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml. The crystallization drops were formed by mixing 1.5 μl of protein solution with 1.5 μl of reservoir solution. All crystals except for the SeMet derivative were grown with a reservoir solution of 20% polyethylene glycol 1000, 100 mm phosphate-citrate, 200 mm Li2SO4, pH 4.2. The SeMet derivative crystal grew with a reservoir solution containing 1.0 m sodium citrate and 100 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. Crystals were cryoprotected in a reservoir solution supplemented with 20% glycerol and 5 mm substrate as necessary. Intensity data were collected at 110K on beamline X6A (National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY) as summarized in Table 1. All data sets were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL2000 software suite of programs, and the scaled intensities were converted to structure factors using the program TRUNCATE (29French S.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The citrate-bound structure was solved by the method of single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering. Heavy atom sites in the substructure were identified using SHELX-D against data collected at the selenium peak wavelength and truncated to 2.5 Å. Three of five possible selenium sites for a single molecule of PglD in the asymmetric unit were located. The correlation coefficients for all/weak reflections were 17.2/11.1, and the Patterson figure of merit was 18.3. Structure factors from the native data were merged with initial phases using CAD, phase extension to 1.77 Å, and density modification was carried out using SHELX-E. Values for contrast, connectivity, mean mapCC, and pseudo-free CC were 1.1, 96, 94, and 80%, respectively. The initial model was built with ARP/wARP (30Perrakis A. Harkiolaki M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The structures of UDP-4-amino-sugar-bound and AcCoA-bound protein were solved by molecular replacement using the software programs PHASER and MOLREP, respectively. In each case the search model was that of the citrate-bound structure, omitting the citrate molecule (3BSW). Refinement and model building were performed using Refmac (31Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A.

Five percent of the data were used to calculate the Rfree factor for cross-validation of the refinement process (35Brunger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 24-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For each structure, ligand atoms were modeled after the Rfree was below 30%, and water molecules were added gradually using COOT and ARP/wARP. Side chain alternate conformations were modeled during the final stages of refinement. Additional crystallographic calculations, including LSQMAN and PROCHECK, were employed from the CCP4 suite (36Collaborative Computational Project N. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar). The final refinement statistics are presented in Table 1.Capillary Electrophoresis Analysis—Capillary electrophoresis was performed using a Beckman/Coulter Proteome 800 or P/ACE MDQ cE system with detection at 254 nm, and manual integration was performed using the Beckman/Coulter 32 Karat, Version 8.0 software package. The running buffer was composed of 25 mm sodium tetraborate, pH 9.4, using a bare silica capillary (75 μm inner diameter × 80 cm) with a detector distance of 72 cm. The capillary was conditioned before each run with 1.0 m NaOH, water, and then buffer. The conditioning solutions were applied using 25 p.s.i. for 3 min. Samples were prepared by passing through a 10,000 Mr weight cut-off membrane, and the filtrate was diluted with water at a ratio of 1:2. Samples were introduced to the capillary by pressure injection for 15 s at 0.5 p.s.i., and separation was performed at 25 kV in negative mode.Kinetic Data Measurement and Analysis—Histidine mutant reactions were conducted in size exclusion chromatography buffer supplemented with 6 μg of bovine serum albumin to serve as a carrier protein and 2 mm AcCoA while varying the concentration of the UDP-4-amino-sugar in a volume of 30 μl. Protein quantities per reaction per mutant construct are provided in Table 2. pH-dependent reactions contained 50-150 pg of enzyme and 6 μg of bovine serum albumin. Reactions in the range of pH 6.5-9.0 were conducted in duplicate with a three-component buffer system consisting of 20 mm MES (pKa 6.2), 20 mm HEPES (pKa 7.6), 20 mm BICINE (pKa 8.3), and 150 mm NaCl. All reaction mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, boiled for 2 min, and then filtered through a 10,000 Mr cut-off membrane and analyzed by capillary electrophoresis as described above. Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the initial reaction rates to the Michaelis-Menten equation for one substrate using the program SigmaPlot Version 9.0. kcat/Km was obtained from the fitted values of Vmax and Km with propagation of the standard errors. These pH-dependent values were fitted to Equation 1, where Y is the observed kcat/Km,[H+] is the proton concentration of the solution, Ka and pKb are the dissociation constants for ionization of groups that ionize at low and high pH, respectively, and C is the pH-independent value.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters for native and point mutants of pgIDConstructProteinKmkcatkcat/KmVmaxmg/assaymms−1s−1 mm−1nmol/s/mgNative2.5 × 10−81.0 ± 0.13143141.47 × 104H15A5.0 × 10−72.5 ± 0.3138556.46 × 103H125A6.5 × 10−41.0 ± 0.29.1 × 10−29.1 × 10−24.25H134A2.0 × 10−60.8 ± 0.210134.71 × 102 Open table in a new tab RESULTSSelf-association in Solution—Proteins belonging to the LβH superfamily of enzymes are generally expected to form trimers (16Raetz C.R. Roderick S.L. Science. 1995; 270: 997-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility for self-association by PglD, we analyzed a purified protein sample using sedimentation velocity AUC at 37 °C in the absence of exogenous coenzyme or sugar substrate. The sedimentation coefficient of PglD was found to be 5.80 ± 0.02 Svedberg units and showed no concentration dependence to the sedimentation coefficient over a protein concentration range of 6-70 μm (supplemental Fig. S2A). Sample concentrations were calculated using the F-statistics function in SEDANAL (28Stafford W.F. Sherwood P.J. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 108: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar); the S.D. of the fit was 0.006 fringes using the Levenberg-Marquardt fitting method. A single species model fit using a 95% confidence interval resulted in a molecular mass of 66 ± 3 kDa (supplemental Fig. S2B). The molecular weight of the construct analyzed was 21.4 kDa, calculated by sequence and verified by MALDI-mass spectrometry (data not shown), which suggests that PglD associates as a homotrimer in solution at 37 °C.Citrate-bound Structure—The co-crystal structure of PglD in the presence of citrate was solved by single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering using native data combined with data collected from an isom"
https://openalex.org/W2044615691,"Rickettsia felis is a flea-associated rickettsial pathogen recurrently identified in both colonized and wild-caught cat fleas, Ctenocephalides felis. We hypothesized that within colonized fleas, the intimate relationship between R. felis and C. felis allows for the coordination of rickettsial replication and metabolically active periods during flea bloodmeal acquisition and oogenesis.A quantitative real-time PCR assay was developed to quantify R. felis in actively feeding R. felis-infected fleas. In three separate trials, fleas were allowed to feed on cats, and a mean of 3.9x10(6) R. felis 17-kDa gene copies was detected for each flea. A distinct R. felis infection pattern was not observed in fleas during nine consecutive days of bloodfeeding. However, an inverse correlation between the prevalence of R. felis-infection, which ranged from 96% in Trial 1 to 35% in Trial 3, and the R. felis-infection load in individual fleas was identified. Expression of R. felis-infection load as a ratio of R. felis/C. felis genes confirmed that fleas in Trial 3 had significantly greater rickettsial loads than those in Trial 1.Examining rickettsial infection dynamics in the flea vector will further elucidate the intimate relationship between R. felis and C. felis, and facilitate a more accurate understanding of the ecology and epidemiology of R. felis transmission in nature."

In the present work, we have identified new Whi3-associated mRNAs by a genomic approach. A large and significant number of these Whi3 targets encode for membrane and exocytic proteins involved in processes such as transport and cell wall biogenesis. Consistent with the genomic data, we have observed that cell wall integrity is compromised in Whi3-deficient cells and found strong genetic interactions between WHI3 and the cell integrity pathway. Whi3-associated mRNAs are enriched in clusters of the tetranucleotide GCAU, and mutation of the GCAU clusters in the CLN3 mRNA caused a reduction in its association to Whi3, suggesting that these sequences may act as cis-determinants for binding. Our data suggest that Whi3 is involved in the regulation and/or localization of a large subset of mRNAs functionally related to the ER and, since it is important for different molecular processes such as cytoplasmic retention or exocytic traffic of proteins, we propose that Whi3 is a general modulator of protein fate in budding yeast.

RNA-binding proteins are involved in posttranslational regulation affecting diverse aspects such as stability, translation, and transport of mRNAs (1Moore M.J. Science. 2005; 309: 1514-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Different data from genomic array analysis revealed that RNA-binding proteins associate with discrete subpolulations of the total mRNAs in the cell (2Takizawa P.A. DeRisi J.L. Wilhelm J.E. Vale R.D.

Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar), which have been referred to as posttranscriptional operons (5Keene J.D. Tenenbaum S.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1161-1167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The transport and local translation of mRNAs are key steps in the regulation of protein localization (6Jansen R.P. Nat. Rev. Mol.

The majority of mRNAs encoding secreted and membrane-bound proteins are translated in polysomes associated with the ER 5The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; RRM, RNA recognition motif; SRP, signal recognition particle; 3-HA, three-hemagglutinin; IP, immunoprecipitation; SGD, Saccharomyces Genome Data base; TAP, tandem affinity purification. membrane (8Nicchitta C.V. Lerner R.S. Stephens S.B. Dodd R.D. Pyhtila B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 83: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Some of these proteins show a signal peptide sequence in the N terminus that is rapidly recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP) after translation initiation. The SRP binds to a receptor localized in the ER membrane facilitating the association of the polysomes to the ER and facilitating the internalization of the nascent protein across the ER membrane by a translation-coupled mechanism. However, by using subcellular fractionation and genomic analysis, a large number of ER-associated mRNAs have been identified that encode proteins without a signal peptide tag (9Diehn M. Eisen M.B. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Since SRP-deficient cells are viable and still have sufficient levels of protein synthesis on the ER (10Mutka S.C. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), specific determinants in the mRNA-containing ribonucleoparticles have been hypothesized that would recognize protein receptors at the ER surface (11Gerst J.E.

Whi3 is an ER-associated protein that contains a C-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), being functionally involved in cell size and cell cycle regulation (15Nash R.S. Volpe T. Futcher B. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1469-1480PubMed Google Scholar). Whi3 binds to the mRNA of CLN3 (16Garí E. Volpe T. Wang H. Gallego C. Futcher B. Aldea M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2803-2808PubMed Google Scholar), the most upstream activator of cell cycle entry in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (17de Bruin R.A. McDonald W.H. Kalashnikova T.I. Yates III, J.

Cln3 is mostly ER-associated in early G1 cells and accumulates in the nucleus in late G1 (19Wang H. Garí E. Vergés E. Gallego C. Aldea M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20Verges E. Colomina N. Garí E. Gallego C. Aldea M. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 649-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Whi3 is important for efficient retention of Cln3 at the ER in early G1 and prevents unscheduled nuclear accumulation of Cln3. On the other hand, Whi3 interacts with the Cdc28 kinase, and we have proposed that Whi3 confines translation of Cln3 in the ER to efficiently retain newly formed Cln3-Cdc28 complexes (19Wang H. Garí E. Vergés E. Gallego C. Aldea M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Whi4, which displays some similarities in the RRM and Cter regions (15Nash R.S. Volpe T. Futcher B. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1469-1480PubMed Google Scholar), seems to play a partially redundant role to Whi3 in cell size control (15Nash R.S. Volpe T. Futcher B.

In addition to cell size regulation, Whi3 is essential for filamentous growth, but the effectors and targets of Whi3 in this process are unknown (22Mosch H.U. Fink G.R. Genetics. 1997; 145: 671-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of Whi3 in cell filamentation is dependent on the presence of the RRM motif and is largely independent of Cln3 function (16Garí E. Volpe T. Wang H. Gallego C. Futcher B. Aldea M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2803-2808PubMed Google Scholar, 19Wang H. Garí E. Vergés E. Gallego C. Aldea M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of additional Whi3 targets. Polysome partitioning between cytosol and ER serves to direct proteins to different compartments in eukaryotic cells, and the existence of different pathways for RNA traffic to the ER is widely accepted (8Nicchitta C.V. Lerner R.S. Stephens S.B. Dodd R.D. Pyhtila B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 83: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 11Gerst J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2008; 18: 68-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Whi3 is an RNA-binding protein associated to the ER, which makes it an interesting candidate for mRNA partitioning. In this work, we have used a genomic approach to identify new mRNA targets of Whi3, and we have obtained a list of more than 300 candidates that includes the mRNA of CLN3. The analysis of the data revealed that a significant number of Whi3-associated mRNAs encode for membrane and exocytic proteins, suggesting that Whi3 is involved in the regulation of ER-associated mRNAs. Since Whi3 is involved in ER-mediated retention and traffic of proteins, we hypothesize that Whi3 would localize mRNA translation at the ER and act as a general modulator of protein fate in budding yeast.

Yeast cells were routinely grown in rich medium (YPD; 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) at 30 °C unless stated otherwise.

Futcher B. Aldea M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2803-2808PubMed Google Scholar, 19Wang H. Garí E. Vergés E. Gallego C. Aldea M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Details of strain and plasmid constructions are available upon request. Affinity Purification Procedure—The method for extract preparation was adapted from Rigaut et al. (28Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Séraphin B. Nat. Biotech. 1999; 10: 1030-1032Crossref Scopus (2287) Google Scholar) as described (16Garí E. Volpe T. Wang H. Gallego C. Futcher B. Aldea M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2803-2808PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, extracts were prepared from 1 liter of yeast cells grown to log phase (A600 = 1). Cells harboring centromeric plasmids were grown initially in selective minimal medium, diluted in YPD medium, and grown more than 8 h. Cell growth was halted by adding ice into the culture, and all subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Buffer A (10 mm K-Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protein inhibitors) was added to frozen pellets, and cells were broken by passing them twice through a French press. The extract was adjusted to a final concentration of 200 mm KCl and 1% Triton and then centrifuged at 4500 × g for 2 min. Samples for input RNA and protein were taken from the supernatant at this step. The remaining extract was added to a column containing 100 μl of Sepharose-IgG beads (Amersham Biosciences), allowing the liquid to drain by gravity flow. Beads were quickly washed twice with IPP150 (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton), allowing the buffer to drain by gravity flow. Finally, washed IgG beads were eluted directly with 1 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen). Input and IP RNAs were purified by using the PureLink total RNA purification system kit (Invitrogen). Microarrays Analysis—cDNA was synthesized from 10-15 μg of input RNA or 0.7-1 μg of IP RNA. An indirect labeling method with amino-allyl-dUTP (Ambion) was used as described previously with slight modifications (29DeRisi, J. In Bowtell D. Sambrook J. DNA Microarrays: A Molecular Cloning Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2002: 187-193Google Scholar). We used priming from both an anchored oligo(dT)20 primer and random hexamers (Invitrogen). As we had multiple independent IPs for each strain, we labeled some IPs with Cy5 and their corresponding inputs with Cy3 and vice versa. The Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNAs (IP versus input) were mixed and hybridized to spotted DNA microarrays, which will be described in detail elsewhere. 6F. Ferrezuelo, M. Aldea, and B. Futcher, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, our arrays contained PCR-amplified DNA fragments targeting ∼5800 S. cerevisiae genes (including 56 small nucleolar RNAs and small nuclear RNAs). Also, arrays contained probes targeting the 3′-untranslated region of some 500 genes in addition to the open reading frame-targeting probe. Most cell cycle-regulated genes described by Spellman et al. (30Spellman P.T. Sherlock G. Zhang M.Q. Iyer V.R. Anders K. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Futcher B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3273-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (3900) Google Scholar) were spotted four times at different locations in the array to assess for spot consistency. Microarrays were scanned with an Axon Genepix 4100A scanner (MDS Analytical Technologies), and data were generated with the Genepix Pro 5 software. We performed a visual quality control to flag abnormally looking spots. Then, spots with low signal-to-noise ratios (<3) in both channels, and those with fewer than 60 pixels were removed. Arrays were normalized by an intensity-dependent method (print-tip loess) implemented in the GEPAS package on the web (31Montaner D. Tárrega J. Huerta-Cepas J. Burguet J. Vaquerizas J.M. Conde L. Minguez P. Vera J. Mukherjee S. Valls J. Pujana M.A. Alloza E. Herrero J. Al-Shahrour F. Dopazo J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: W486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Median pixel intensities and background subtraction were used, and the software produced normalized log2 ratios (IP/input) of the median pixel intensity for each spot. For duplicated spots in the array, inconsistent spots as defined by having a value departing more than 0.5 from their median were removed, and the median of consistent duplicated spots was taken as representative value for that gene. We selected as candidate targets those genes that were in the 90 percentile or higher in at least four of the six Whi3-IPs. This amounted to 340 probes targeting 337 genes. Of these, we removed 11 genes that passed this selection criterion in the mock IPs. Miscellaneous—We have used a signal amplification method to detect endogenous levels of Cln3-3HA by immunofluorescence (16Garí E. Volpe T. Wang H. Gallego C. Futcher B. Aldea M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2803-2808PubMed Google Scholar). Slides were sequentially incubated with rat anti-HA (clone 3F10, Roche Applied Science) and goat anti-rat and rabbit anti-goat antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 (Molecular Probes). To analyze nuclear accumulation of Cln3, Image J software was used to set a threshold to outline the cytoplasm of most cells in the immunofluorescence image. The threshold was increased 2-fold, and outlined regions were scored as positive nuclei by visual comparison with a stacked 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole image. Yeast cells growing exponentially in YPD at A600 < 0.5 were used to obtain cell volume distributions with a Z2 Coulter counter (16Garí E. Volpe T. Wang H. Gallego C. Futcher B. Aldea M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2803-2808PubMed Google Scholar). Cells harboring centromeric plasmids were grown initially in selective minimal medium, diluted in YPD medium, and grown overnight. Protein extracts and Western blot analysis with mouse anti-HA (clone 12CA5) and anti-phospho-P44/P42 (New England Biolabs) antibodies were performed as described previously (23Gallego C. Garí E. Colomina N. Herrero E. Aldea M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7196-7206Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 32de la Torre-Ruiz M.A. Torres J. Ariño J. Herrero E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33468-33476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). TAP-tagged proteins were detected with a peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-peroxidase antibody-soluble complex (Sigma) (28Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Séraphin B. Nat. Biotech. 1999; 10: 1030-1032Crossref Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). Protein concentration in supernatants was determined by a Micro DC protein assay (Bio-Rad), and equivalent amounts of total protein extracts were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Chemiluminescent detection was performed using a Lumi-Imager system (Roche Applied Science). Identification of mRNAs Associated with Whi3—To identify mRNAs associated with Whi3, we performed pull-down experiments with a Whi3-TAP-tagged strain (16Garí E. Volpe T. Wang H. Gallego C. Futcher B. Aldea M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2803-2808PubMed Google Scholar). This procedure yielded sufficient RNA for labeling without amplification by reverse transcription-PCR (3Tenenbaum S.A. Carson C.C. Lager P.J. Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14085-14090Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 33Gerber A.P. Herschlag D. Brown P.O. PLOS Biol. 2004; 2: 342-354Crossref Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Whi3-associated mRNAs and total RNA were used to produce labeled cDNAs and then mixed and hybridized to DNA microarrays. The same procedure was performed with untagged cells as control (mock). We performed six independent experiments with the Whi3-TAP strain and five with the untagged strain (supplemental Table S1). As expected for a specific capture in pull-down experiments, the distribution of mRNAs bound to Whi3 showed an asymmetric pattern (Fig. 1). Approximately 3.7% of mRNAs were situated beyond two positive standard deviations compared with only a 0.95% of mRNAs beyond two negative standard deviations. On the contrary, the distribution of the mock isolates was symmetrical, indicating irrelevant enrichment of mRNAs. In a previous work, we had described the specific interaction of the CLN3 mRNA with the Whi3 protein (16Garí E. Volpe T. Wang H. Gallego C. Futcher B. Aldea M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2803-2808PubMed Google Scholar). In the arrays, which contained four CLN3 spots distributed at different locations, the mRNA of CLN3 was clearly enriched in all the Whi3-TAP samples with an average log2 ratio of 1.98, whereas in the mock samples, the average log2 ratio was -0.03 (Fig. 1). Moreover, this enrichment was repetitive and consistent in all the CLN3 spots among the different experiments, giving strong support to the validity of our results. To define a group of targets specific to Whi3, we applied a ranking approach by selecting those genes that were in the 90 percentile or higher in at least four of the six Whi3-IPs. Following the same criterion, we only found 11 sequences of small nucleolar RNAs that were also consistently enriched in the mock sample. After removal of these mock sequences, we obtained a list with 326 enriched mRNAs in our Whi3-TAP samples (Fig. 2A; supplemental Table S1). Consistently, CLN3 was located among the top 20 candidates. The consistency of the list was highly reproducible independently of the application of other statistical methods for selection and cutoff. 7N. Colomina, F. Ferrezuelo, H. Wang, M. Aldea, and E.

Other metrics gave similar results. Java TreeView was used to generate the tree.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also applied the same pull-down analysis to determine the target mRNAs for Whi4, which shares some structural and functional similarities with Whi3 (15Nash R.S. Volpe T. Futcher B. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1469-1480PubMed Google Scholar). In three independent experiments using the Whi4-TAP strain, we obtained lower signals in the microarray, perhaps due to the lower amounts of Whi4 in the pull-down samples when compared with Whi3 (data not shown). Nonetheless, the genes enriched in Whi3 experiments were also slightly enriched in Whi4 pull-down samples (Figs. 1 and 2A). In agreement with this result, Whi3 and Whi4 show partial functional redundancy as deduced from their phenotypical analysis (Refs. 15Nash R.S. Volpe T. Futcher B. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1469-1480PubMed Google Scholar and 21Sopko R. Huang D. Preston N. Chua G. Papp B. Kafadar K. Snyder M. Oliver S.G. Cyert M. Hughes T.R. Boone C. Andrews B. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 319-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar and see below). Many mRNAs selected by their association to Whi3 encode membrane- and ER-associated proteins (see below). Given that Whi3 is localized in ER fractions (20Verges E. Colomina N. Garí E. Gallego C. Aldea M. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 649-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the enrichment in the pull-down sample could be caused by the presence of contaminant ER structures bound to Whi3. To exclude this possibility, we used two strains harboring the ER-associated proteins Dpm1 and Sfb3 tagged with the TAP epitope as controls. We carried out four pull downs with the Dpm1-TAP strain and three pull downs with the Sfb3-TAP strain (supplemental Table S1). The protein Dpm1 contains a transmembrane domain that is anchored to the ER. Dpm1 was insoluble in our non-denaturing extracts and undetectable in the supernatant of cell extracts after centrifugation (see “Experimental Procedures”) (data not shown), indicating the absence of contaminating ER membranes in the extracts. Microarray analysis of Dpm1-TAP pull-downs produced very similar results to those obtained with the untagged strain and, accordingly, Whi3 targets were not found significantly enriched (Figs. 1 and 2A). Sfb3 was soluble in non-denaturing extracts, perhaps due to the fact that it associates to the cytoplasmic face of the ER and was detected in the pull-down samples (data not shown). Despite that, the distribution of mRNAs in the pull downs with this strain was also similar to the untagged strain as shown by cluster analysis (Fig. 2B), being that the Whi3 targets are not enriched either (Figs. 1 and 2A). Additionally, we compared our list of genes with available data for mRNAs bound to She proteins (14Shepard K.A. Gerber A.P. Jambhekar A. Takizawa P.A. Brown P.O. Herschalg D. DeRisi J.L. Vale R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11429-11434Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). These proteins are associated to the ER and are required to transport several mRNAs to the bud. The majority of Whi3 targets were not found among those bound by She proteins (data not shown), which further supports the specificity of our pull-down analysis with the Whi3-TAP strain. Whi3 Significantly Binds mRNAs Encoding Membrane and Exocytic Proteins—To gain insight into the function of Whi3 as an RNA-binding protein, we classified the Whi3-associated transcripts by the subcellular localization of their coded products according to the MIPS yeast genome data base (34Mewes H.W. Dietmann S. Frishman D. Gregory R. Mannhaupt G. Mayer K.F. Münsterkötter M. Ruepp A. Spannagl M. Stümpflen V. Rattei T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D196-D201Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and the Saccharomyces Genome Data base (SGD) (35Issel-Tarver L. Christie K.R. Dolinski K. Andrada R. Balakrishnan R. Ball C.A. Binkley G. Dong S. Dwight S.S. Fisk D.G. Harris M. Schroeder M. Sethuraman A. Tse K. Weng S. Botstein D. Cherry J.M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 329-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Out of the 326 Whi3-associated transcripts, the localization data were available for 306 candidates, which were categorized in five distinct cell compartments similarly as described previously by Kumar et al. (36Kumar A. Agarwal S. Heyman J.A. Matson S. Heidtman M. Piccirillo S. Umansky L. Drawid A. Jansen R. Liu Y. Cheung K.H. Miller P. Gerstein M. Roeder G.S. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 707-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Remarkably, the exocytosis network and plasma membrane compartments were substantially enriched in comparison with the entire yeast genome. The exocytosis network is a broad compartment that includes proteins localized in the ER and along the secretory pathway but also a large number of secreted proteins finally localized in the cell periphery. In accordance with this, the analysis of the data in the Gene Ontology (GO) data base showed that the Whi3 targets were significantly enriched in transcripts encoding proteins localized in the ER, cell wall, and plasma membrane (Fig. 3B). Concomitantly, our data showed that a relevant part of the proteins encoded by Whi3-associated transcripts contain a transmembrane domain (Fig. 3C), among them the 84.6% of plasma membrane targets and the 56% of exocytic network targets. A 21.5% of the proteins encoded by Whi3 targets show a putative signal peptide tag (34Mewes H.W. Dietmann S. Frishman D. Gregory R. Mannhaupt G. Mayer K.F. Münsterkötter M. Ruepp A. Spannagl M. Stümpflen V. Rattei T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D196-D201Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 35Issel-Tarver L. Christie K.R. Dolinski K. Andrada R. Balakrishnan R. Ball C.A. Binkley G.

This percentage rises to 50% for the targets grouped in the exocytosis network, indicating that a significant fraction of Whi3 targets encodes for proteins likely translocated to the ER lumen. Then, the overall analysis of the data suggests that Whi3 significantly binds transcripts encoding membrane and exocytic proteins. Assuming that the majority of these transcripts are translated in ER-associated polysomes, we propose that Whi3 binds specifically to ER-associated mRNAs. This is in agreement with our previous result showing the association of Whi3 to the ER fraction (20Verges E. Colomina N. Garí E. Gallego C. Aldea M. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 649-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We also used the Gene Ontology annotation for process and function to analyze the list of Whi3 targets, which indicated that the encoded proteins participate in a broad spectrum of cell processes (supplemental Table S1). The most abundant group of Whi3-associated mRNAs encodes for proteins involved in transport (Fig. 3D). This group includes 52 mRNAs encoding c"

Connexin43, the main channel-forming protein expressed in ventricular myocytes, can associate with zonula occludens-1, a scaffolding protein linked to the actin cytoskeleton and to signal transduction molecules. The possible influence of Rho GTPases, major regulators of cellular junctions and of the actin cytoskeleton, in the modulation of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) was examined. The activation of RhoA by cytoxic necrotizing factor 1 markedly enhanced GJIC, whereas its specific inhibition by the Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme significantly reduced it. RhoA activity affects GJIC without major cellular redistribution of junctional plaques or changes in the Cx43 phosphorylation pattern. As these GTPases frequently act via the cortical cytoskeleton, the importance of F-actin in the modulation of GJIC was investigated by means of agents interfering with actin polymerization. Cytoskeleton stabilization by phalloidin slowed down the kinetics of channel rundown in the absence of ATP, whereas its disruption by cytochalasin D rapidly and markedly reduced GJIC despite ATP presence. Cytoskeleton stabilization by phalloidin markedly reduced the consequences of RhoA activation or inactivation.

https://openalex.org/W2162233723,"Human embryonic stem (hES) cells have unique abilities to divide indefinitely without differentiating and potential to differentiate into more than 200 cell types. These properties make hES cells an ideal model system for understanding early human development and for regenerative medicine. Molecular mechanisms including cellular signaling and transcriptional regulation play important roles in hES cell differentiation. However, very little information is available on posttranscriptional regulation of hES cell pluripotency, self-renewal, and early decisions about cell fate. microRNAs (miRNAs), 22-nt long non-coding small RNAs found in plants and animals, regulate gene expression by targeting mRNAs for cleavage or translation repression. In hES cells we found that 276 miRNAs were expressed; of these, a set of 30 miRNAs had significantly changed expression during differentiation. Using a representative example, miR-302b, we show that miRNAs in human ES cells assemble into a bona fide RISC that contains Ago2 and can specifically cleave perfectly matched target RNA. Our results demonstrate that human ES cell differentiation is accompanied by changes in the expression of a unique set of miRNAs, providing a glimpse of a new molecular circuitry that may regulate early development in humans. Chromosomes 19 and X contained 98 and 40 miRNA genes, respectively, indicating that majority of miRNA genes in hES cells were expressed from these two chromosomes. Strikingly, distribution analysis of miRNA gene loci across six species including dog, rat, mouse, rhesus, chimpanzee, and human showed that miRNA genes encoded in chromosome 19 were drastically increased in chimpanzees and humans while miRNA gene loci on other chromosomes were decreased as compared with dog, rat, and mouse. Comparative genomic studies showed 99% conservation of chromosome 19 miRNA genes between chimpanzees and humans. Together, these findings reveal the evolutionary emergence, approximately 5 million years ago, of miRNAs involved in regulating early human development. One could imagine that this burst of miRNA gene clusters at specific chromosomes was part of an evolutionary event during species divergence."

Here we analyzed mice with modified Jab1 expression. Mice ectopically expressing a more stable form of JAB1 protein under the control of a constitutive promoter were rescued from the embryonic lethality caused by the Jab1–/– allele and developed a myeloproliferative disorder in a gene dosage-dependent manner. Hematopoietic cells from the bone marrow of Jab1 transgenic mice had a significantly larger stem cell population and exhibited higher and transplantable proliferative potential. In contrast, Jab1+/– mice, which express ∼70% as much JAB1 protein as their wild-type littermates, showed inefficient hematopoiesis. Expression of the tumor suppressor p16INK4a was inversely correlated with that of JAB1, and the oncoprotein SMYD3, a newly identified JAB1 interactor, suppressed transcription of p16 in cooperation with JAB1. Thus, the expression and function of JAB1 are critical for the proliferation and maintenance of hematopoietic progenitors.

JAB1 was identified originally as a protein binding to the transcription factors c-JUN and JUN D (1Claret F.X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) and later as the fifth (CSN5) of eight (CSN1–8) subunits of the COP9 signalosome (CSN) complex (2Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K.

However, it remains to be determined whether these different activities were regulated simultaneously or separately, and were specifically associated with the JAB1 subunit or regulated by the entire CSN complex. JAB1 seems to play an essential role in the control of mammalian cell proliferation and survival. In mice, the level of JAB1 expression is higher in embryos, where vigorous cell proliferation occurs, than in adults(12Bounpheng M.A. Melnikova I.N. Dodds S.G. Chen H. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J.

Jab1-null embryos die soon after implantation, and Jab1–/– embryonic cells exhibit impaired proliferation and accelerated apoptosis. Jab1+/– mice, which express only ∼70% as much Jab1 protein as their wild-type littermates, were viable and fertile but smaller in size, and Jab1+/– mouse embryo fibroblast cells exhibited an inefficient down-regulation of the CDK inhibitor p27 during G1 and delayed cell cycle progression (13Tomoda K.

Recently, high levels of JAB1 have been found in human cancers. Although a certain level of JAB1 is expressed in normally proliferating and in nonproliferating cells, an increase in JAB1 expression of severalfold is observed in a variety of human cancer cells, such as breast cancer (14Esteva F.J.

Ginzinger D. Li R. Dykema K.J. So S. Fan S.T. Kakar S. Furge K.A. Buttner R. Chen X. Carcinogenesis. 2005; 26: 2050-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), a high level of JAB1 is associated with an increase in the genomic DNA copy number of the Jab1 locus. In chronic myeloid leukemia (24Tomoda K. Kato J.Y. Tatsumi E. Takahashi T. Matsuo Y. Yoneda-Kato N. Blood. 2005; 105: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), JAB1 functions downstream of BCR-ABL kinase through the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways and facilitates cell cycle progression. A high level of JAB1 is often correlated with a poor prognosis and sometimes related to a low level of the CDK inhibitor p27. Furthermore, in cases of breast cancer, coordinated amplification of the MYC and CSN5 (JAB1) genes was observed (25Adler A.S. Lin M. Horlings H. Nuyten D.S. van de Vijver M.J. Chang H.Y. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, the physiological significance of JAB1 overexpression in cancer cells and the molecular mechanism by which JAB1 is involved in the proliferation of cancer cells remain to be examined. In this study, we analyzed mice with a modified JAB1 expression. We demonstrated that the level of JAB1 expression is a critical determinant of the proliferation and maintenance of hematopoietic progenitor cells in vivo, which may explain how the overexpression of JAB1 contributes to tumor development. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Colony Formation Assay—NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts and 293T human embryonic kidney cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum.

Tomoda K. Umehara M. Arata Y. Kato J.Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1739-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The vectors for RNA interference were constructed with the pSilencer expression vector system (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection was carried out using a modified calcium phosphate-DNA precipitation method (27Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). Recombinant retroviruses were produced by transfecting 293T cells with MSCV-based expression vectors, together with a plasmid encoding a ψ2 helper virus. The supernatants were harvested 48–72 h post-transfection and immediately used for infection. Bone marrow cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 5% WEHI conditioned medium, mouse stem cell factor (50 ng/ml), mouse IL-3 (6 ng/ml), and human IL-6 (10 ng/ml) and infected with culture supernatants twice according to the spin infection procedure in the presence of Polybrene (4 μg/ml). For colony formation assays, cells isolated from bone marrow, spleen, and peripheral blood were plated (1.5–2.0 × 104 cells/35-mm dish) on a methylcellulose medium (MethoCult GF M3434; StemCell Technologies Inc.). After 7–12 days, colonies containing more than 100 cells were enumerated. For the second and third plating, cells were collected from the methylcellulose medium and replated (1.0 × 104 cells/35-mm dish) in fresh medium. Some colonies were cytocentrifuged onto glass slides, stained with a May-Grunwald Giemsa solution, and viewed by phase-contrast microscopy in order to evaluate lineage. Mice—Jab1+/– mice and ES cells were generated as described (13Tomoda K. Yoneda-Kato N. Fukumoto A. Yamanaka S. Kato J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43013-43018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Mouse JAB1 cDNA was combined with a tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged sequence, cloned into a pCAG-IRES-puro expression vector (26Yoneda-Kato N. Tomoda K. Umehara M. Arata Y. Kato J.Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1739-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), introduced into Jab1+/– RF8 mouse ES cells by electroporation, and selected in 5 μg/ml puromycin. Two TAP-JAB1-positive Jab1+/– ES cell lines were microinjected into C57BL/6 embryos, and chimeric males were crossed with C57BL/6 females. The transgene was detected by standard genomic PCR using a pair of primers: 5′-AGT GGT ATG GCC CAG AAA ACC TGG GAA TTG-3′ and 5′-CTG CTG GTT CAG CAT CTG TGT ACT AAC ATC AAT CC-3′. The genotype of the endogenous Jab1 gene locus was determined as described (13Tomoda K. Yoneda-Kato N. Fukumoto A. Yamanaka S. Kato J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43013-43018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). All mice were maintained in the Nara Institute of Science and Technology Animal Facility in accordance with Nara Institute of Science and Technology guidelines. Blood samples were routinely analyzed with an automated cell counter (F-820 analyzer; Sysmex) and also by inspecting blood smears after May-Grunwald Giemsa staining (Merck). For myelosuppressive treatment, mice were injected with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (300 mg/kg of body weight; Kyowa Hakko Kogyo) intravenously, and hematopoietic recovery was monitored in peripheral blood. At specific points in time, mice were sacrificed, femurs were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and BM sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For the bone marrow transplantation experiment, cells were injected into the veins of NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J (NOD-SCID) mice (Jackson Laboratory), and peripheral blood was routinely monitored. Flow Cytometric Analysis—PharM Lyse (BD Bioscience) was used to remove red blood cells, and FcγIII/II receptors were blocked with a specific antibody (2.4G2; BD Bioscience). Cells were stained for 30 min at 4 °C with a mixture of phycoerythrin-Cy5-conjugated antibodies to CD3ϵ (145-2C11), B220 (RA3-6B2), TER-119 (TER-119), MAC-1 (M1/70), and GR-1 (RB6-8C5); allophycocyanin-conjugated antibody to c-Kit (ACK2); phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody to SCA-1 (E13-161.7); and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody to CD34 (RAM34/49E8) (all from eBioscience) and analyzed with FACSVantage (BD Biosciences). Spleen cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody to MAC-1 (M1/70) and phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody to GR-1 (RB6-8C5). For the cell cycle analysis, cells were stained with a 1-ml solution of 0.1% sodium citrate and 0.1% Triton X-100 containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and treated with 1 μg/ml RNase for 30 min at room temperature. Fluorescence from the propidium iodide-DNA complex was measured with a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and the percentages of cells in phases G1, S, and G2/M of the cell cycle were determined with Modifit cell cycle software. Histological Methods—Tissues were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, cut into 4-μm sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For blood smears, blood was obtained from a tail vein onto glass slides and stained with May-Grunwald Giemsa solution. Blood counts were determined using an automated cell counter. For cytospins, 1.0 × 105 cells were cytocentrifuged (500 rpm for 3 min) onto glass slides and stained with May-Grunwald Giemsa solution. Myeloperoxidase activity was detected with the DAB staining kit (Muto Pure Chemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Chloroacetate esterase staining was performed with assistance from Narabyouri Research. Protein Analyses—Cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting were performed as described (11Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 13Tomoda K. Yoneda-Kato N. Fukumoto A. Yamanaka S. Kato J.Y. J. Biol.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to JAB1 and SMYD3 were generated against bacterially produced recombinant polypeptides. A rabbit polyclonal antibody to GFP (BD Living Colors) and mouse monoclonal antibodies to γ-tubulin (GYU-88) and an HA epitope (clone 12CA5) were obtained from BD Biosciences, Sigma, and Roche Applied Science, respectively. Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated and converted to cDNA using ISOGEN reagent (Nippon Gene) and RNase-free Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The polymerase chain reaction was performed within a linear range described previously (26Yoneda-Kato N. Tomoda K. Umehara M. Arata Y. Kato J.Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1739-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 28Matsumoto N. Yoneda-Kato N. Iguchi T. Kishimoto Y. Kyo T. Sawada H. Tatsumi E. Fukuhara S. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1757-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the data were normalized to the expression level of β-actin for each sample. We confirmed that the reactions were quantitatively performed within a linear range in several control experiments. The following oligonucleotide primer pairs were used: Jab1, 5′-GAA GCG CAG AGT ATC GAT GAA A-3′ and 5′-GCC AAT GCT GAG ATT TTG CA-3′; γ-tubulin, 5′-ATG AGT GAC GTG GTG GTC CAA-3′ and 5′-CGG TCT GTG GCT ATC AGG TTC A-3′; β-actin, 5′-TCA GCA AGC AGG AGT ACG ATG A-3′ and 5′-CTG CGC AAG TTA GGT TTT GTC A-3′. Primer pairs for Ink4a, Arf, and Cip1 were reported previously. Real time PCR was performed with an ABI7700 sequence detection system using a quantitative RT-PCR kit with SYBR Green (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. All experiments were performed in triplicate. GST Pulldown Assay—cDNA fragments containing the CSN6 and SMYD3 coding sequences were inserted into the pGEX vector (Amersham Biosciences) in frame with GST. GST-fused proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified as described (11Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Crude cell extracts containing HA-JAB1 protein were prepared from COS7 cells transfected with the HA-JAB1 expression vector in an EBC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm EDTA) containing 5 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm NaVO4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Binding was performed in the EBC buffer, the protein complexes were washed in the same buffer, and the bound protein was detected by immunoblotting. The same amounts of beads used for the binding assay were subjected to immunoblotting with antibodies to GST to quantitatively examine the GST-fused proteins. Transactivation Assay—Fragments containing ∼2 kb of DNA upstream of exon 1α of the Ink4a locus were inserted into the pGL3-Basic and pGL3-Enhancer vectors (Promega) to generate luciferase reporter constructs. Cells were transfected with the p16 reporter and the cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase plasmid, together with additional SMYD3 and JAB1 expression plasmids. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined using reporter gene assay kits (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The luciferase activity was normalized to that of β-galactosidase for each sample. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Cells were cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min, and chromosomal DNA was fragmented by sonication. The fixed chromatin samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation using antibodies specific to SMYD3 and JAB1. The sets of primers used for the ChIP assay were mouse Ink4a (5′-GGT ATA ATA TAA GGT GAG ACT CTC CTT TC-3′ and 5′-TCC CCA TAT TCT TTA TAT GGC CAC AGC TAT T-3′) and human INK4a (5′-ACT CTG CTT CTA GAA CAC TGA GCA CTT TTT CTG-3′ and 5′-TAG TTG TGA GAG CCC CAC CGA GAA TCG AAA TC-3′). Ectopic Overexpression of Stable Form of JAB1 Rescues Jab1 Knock-out Phenotype—In order to analyze the effect of the ectopic expression of JAB1 in a wide range of cell lineages, we constitutively expressed ectopic JAB1 protein in the whole body of mice. In a previous experiment, we were successful in transiently overexpressing JAB1 protein in a variety of cell types (11Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). However, after selection with a drug marker, few stable cell lines that overexpressed ectopic JAB1 protein were established. Following exhaustive efforts using a variety of expression constructs (HA- and FLAG-tagged JAB1 as well as an intact JAB1), cell lines, and transfection methods, we finally ended up with a TAP-tagged JAB1 (TAP-JAB1) vector, with which we established a number of human and mouse cell lines overexpressing ectopic JAB1 protein. This is partially due to the stabilization of JAB1 protein by fusion with the TAP tag. Pulse-chase experiments in the presence of cycloheximide revealed that the half-life of endogenous JAB1 was ∼5.1 h, whereas that of TAP-JAB1 was about 46 h. Encouraged by this result, we introduced TAP-JAB1 into mouse ES cells and successfully established 11 independent ES clones, which stably express ectopic JAB1 protein (Fig. 1A). We picked two independent lines and used them in assays giving basically the same results. The level of TAP-JAB1 in ES cells was ∼4-fold more than that of endogenous JAB1 protein normally expressed in ES cells. The morphology of ES cells expressing TAP-JAB1 was indistinguishable from that of parental cells, suggesting that TAP-JAB1 expression did not alter the multipotency of ES cells. In fact, after the injection of ES cells expressing TAP-JAB1 into mouse embryos, mice expressing TAP-JAB1 were born. TAP-JAB1 transgenic (Tg) mice appeared normal and healthy at birth and were fertile. The expression of TAP-JAB1 was stably maintained in all organs and cell types tested, which included kidney, lung, spleen, bone marrow, and embryonic fibroblasts (examples of kidney and lung are shown in Fig. 1B). Ectopic TAP-JAB1 expression increased the amount of the COP9 signalosome complex without increasing the amount of endogenous JAB1 protein, suggesting that TAP-JAB1 was incorporated into the COP9 complex in addition to enhancing the small complex (Fig. 1C), which makes a clear distinction from that of HA-tagged JAB1 protein. HA-JAB1 was preferably incorporated into the small complex (24Tomoda K. Kato J.Y. Tatsumi E. Takahashi T. Matsuo Y. Yoneda-Kato N. Blood. 2005; 105: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We previously found that Jab1 knock-out mice die in the embryonic stage (they die before embryonic day 6.5–7.5) (13Tomoda K. Yoneda-Kato N. Fukumoto A. Yamanaka S. Kato J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43013-43018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To investigate whether ectopic TAP-JAB1 can rescue Jab1–/– mice, we first expressed TAP-JAB1 in mice with the Jab1+/– genetic background. After intercrossing TAP-JAB1 Jab1+/– mice, we found that TAP-JAB1 Jab1–/– mice were born alive (Fig. 1D), with a frequency (18.5%, n = 27) close to that expected from the Mendelian rule. The appearance of these mice was normal and healthy, indicating that the TAP-JAB1 transgene can substitute for the endogenous Jab1 gene. Therefore, together with the result in Fig. 1C, we concluded that TAP tagging did not interfere with the normal function of JAB1 protein. JAB1-Tg Mice Develop a Myeloproliferative Disorder—TAP-JAB1 transgenic (JAB1-Tg) mice appeared normal at birth and showed little difference in size, behavior, and reproductive ability from their wild-type littermates. After 6 months, however, they started to exhibit abnormal peripheral blood (PB) leukocyte numbers (Fig. 2A) and anemia (Fig. 2, B and C) and developed a myeloproliferative disease, the population being dominated by granulocytes (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, this occurrence (more than 2 × 104 leukocytes/mm3 in PB) was correlated with the integrity of the endogenous Jab1 locus in a gene dosage-dependent manner (Fig. 2D), because both TAP-JAB1 Jab1+/+ and TAP-JAB1 Jab1+/– mice developed this disease, whereas TAP-JAB1 Jab1–/– mice did not, and the frequency was slightly higher and the timing of occurrence was a little earlier for TAP-JAB1 Jab1+/+ mice than for TAP-JAB1 Jab1+/– animals. (Note that Jab1+/– alleles express ∼70% as much JAB1 protein as Jab1+/+ alleles, so that the difference is subtle between Jab1+/– and Jab1+/+ cells, whereas Jab1–/– cells contain no endogenous JAB1 protein.) These results suggest that the TAP-JAB1 transgene was cooperating with the endogenous JAB1 to induce the abnormality. However, once mice developed a myeloproliferative disorder, there was no significant difference in the counts of white blood cells and red blood cells (Fig. 2, A and B) and the type of cells (granulocytes) that dominated in PB (Fig. 2E) between TAP-JAB1 Jab1+/+ and TAP-JAB1 Jab1+/– animals. The mice were sacrificed for autopsy when they developed anemia, less than 8 × 106 RBC/mm3, or leukocytosis, over 2 × 104 cells/mm3, or when they apparently became sick. JAB1-Tg mice frequently showed a massive enlargement of the spleen (Fig. 2, F and G), and JAB1-Tg BM appeared pale and hypercellular. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the c-Kit+ Sca-1+ Lin– (KSL) fraction, which was enriched for the hematopoietic stem cell/progenitor population, was expanded in JAB1-Tg bone marrow (5.27 ± 0.53 × 104 to 1.67 ± 0.42 × 105 cells/bone marrow, p < 0.01, n = 5). Fig. 2H shows one example of such an analysis, in which the percentages of the KSL population among all bone marrow cells are shown (0.04% versus 0.25% for those of wild type and JAB1-Tg mice, respectively). Furthermore, the CD34–/low population was enriched in the KSL fraction isolated from JAB1-Tg mice (Fig. 2H, 9.0 versus 19%), indicating that JAB1-Tg mice contained a larger pool of hematopoietic stem cell/progenitor cells than wild type animals. FACS analysis of spleen cells revealed that the number of Gr-1hi/Mac-1hi granulocytes increased in spleen (2.30 ± 0.96 × 106 to 1.79 ± 0.38 × 107, p < 0.002, n = 5) of JAB1-Tg mice. Fig. 2I represents one such analysis, in which percentages of the Gr-1hi/Mac-1hi population among total spleen cells are shown (1.9 versus 5.7% for wild type and JAB1-Tg mice, respectively). Fig. 2I also shows that the single anti-Mac1 staining revealed a marked difference between the two (8.2 versus 23%). These data show that granulocytes and myeloid progenitor cells were accumulated in the spleen of JAB1-Tg mice. The cytological investigation of the May-Grunwald Giemsa-stained cytospins also confirmed the results, indicating that JAB1-Tg mice develop a progressive myeloid hyperplasia with overproduction of granulocytes. In contrast to this, we observed less influence on lymphopoiesis and erythropoiesis. In 4 of 4 sick JAB1-Tg mice examined, histological and cytological analyses revealed that a massive number of leukemic cells had infiltrated nonhematopoietic organs, such as the lung, liver, and kidney (examples of liver and lung are shown in Fig. 2, J and K, respectively). Examinations of cell morphology at higher magnification (Fig. 2L for the example of the liver) revealed that the infiltrates were blood cells, some of which were positive for myeloid markers, such as chloroacetate esterase and myeloperoxidase (data not shown). In contrast, the wild-type or TAP-GFP control mice, which constitutively express ectopic TAP-tagged GFP protein throughout the body, showed little evidence of increased myelopoiesis for up to 13 months (Fig. 2D). Thus, these results indicate that JAB1-Tg mice develop a progressive myeloid hyperplasia with overproduction of granulocytes, which resembles human CML in the chronic phase, and this phenotype is due to the enhanced activity or function of JAB1 protein. Increased Proliferation and Extended Survival of JAB1-Tg Hematopoietic Progenitors—To investigate the potential for growth and differentiation of the hematopoietic progenitors expanded in JAB1-Tg mice, cells isolated from bone marrow, spleen, and peripheral blood of wild-type and JAB1-Tg mice were quantitatively analyzed by a colony formation assay in a methylcellulose medium supplemented with a combination of cytokines (IL-6, IL-3, mouse stem cell factor, and erythropoietin) (Table 1). The cells from BM formed colonies of erythroids, granulocytes, macrophages, granulocyte/macrophages, and all mixed lineages, and colony-forming frequencies of all lineages were increased for cells from JAB1-Tg mice compared with those of wild-type mice (∼1.8-fold increase in total) (Table 1, first and second rows). Cells from control spleen and PB barely formed any colonies, whereas JAB1-Tg spleen and PB cells formed colonies of all lineages (Table 1, fifth and sixth rows). The formation of colonies predominantly consisting of either erythroids, granulocytes, or macrophages in addition to the mixed type suggests that, besides stem cells (or immature progenitors), more committed progenitor cells were also contained in spleen and PB.TABLE 1Increased colony formation of JAB1-Tg hematopoietic progenitors in vitroJAB1 genotypeSource of cellsColony number/10,000 cellsWithout TAP-JAB1With TAP-JAB1EGMMixEGMMix+/+BM6.33 ± 1.8658.2 ± 13.31.00 ± 0.6316.3 ± 13.2122 ± 73.76.50 ± 5.39+/-BM2.50 ± 1.0024.0 ± 8.700.75 ± 0.963.75 ± 1.7167.0 ± 10.05.75 ± 0.96+/+BM 2ndaReplating for the second and third rounds.6.00"
https://openalex.org/W1964491597,"Background Obesity is not only associated with metabolic abnormalities, but also with cognitive dysfunction and changes in the central nervous system. The present pilot study was carried out to investigate functional connectivity in obese and non-obese adolescents using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Methodology/Principal Findings Magnetoencephalographic recordings were performed in 11 obese (mean BMI 38.8±4.6 kg/m2) and 8 lean (mean BMI 21.0±1.5 kg/m2) female adolescents (age 12–19 years) during an eyes-closed resting-state condition. From these recordings, the synchronization likelihood (SL), a common method that estimates both linear and non-linear interdependencies between MEG signals, was calculated within and between brain regions, and within standard frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2, beta and gamma). The obese adolescents had increased synchronization in delta (0.5–4 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) frequency bands compared to lean controls (Pdelta total = 0.001; Pbeta total = 0.002). Conclusions/Significance This study identified increased resting-state functional connectivity in severe obese adolescents. Considering the importance of functional coupling between brain areas for cognitive functioning, the present findings strengthen the hypothesis that obesity may have a major impact on human brain function. The cause of the observed excessive synchronization is unknown, but might be related to disturbed motivational pathways, the recently demonstrated increase in white matter volume in obese subjects or altered metabolic processes like hyperinsulinemia. The question arises whether the changes in brain structure and communication are a dynamic process due to weight gain and whether these effects are reversible or not."
https://openalex.org/W1982631371,"Platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) induced cyclin A expression and CDK2 activity in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Inhibition of nuclear factors of activated T cell (NFAT) activation by cyclosporin A (CsA) and VIVIT suppressed PDGF-BB-induced cyclin A expression and CDK2 activity, resulting in blockade of VSMC in the G(1) phase. In addition, CsA- and VIVIT-mediated inhibition of NFATs and small interfering RNA-targeted down-regulation of cyclin A levels suppressed PDGF-BB-induced VSMC DNA synthesis. PDGF-BB also induced cyclin A mRNA levels in VSMC in an NFAT-dependent manner. Cloning and bioinformatic analysis of rat cyclin A promoter revealed the presence of NFAT-binding elements, and PDGF-BB induced the binding of NFATs to these regulatory sequences in a CsA- and VIVIT-sensitive manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that NFATc1 binds to the cyclin A promoter in response to PDGF-BB in a VIVIT-sensitive manner. Furthermore, PDGF-BB induced cyclin A promoter-luciferase reporter gene activity in VSMC, and it was inhibited by both CsA and VIVIT. Balloon injury induced cyclin A expression and CDK2 activity in rat carotid arteries, and these responses were also blocked by VIVIT. In addition, VIVIT attenuated balloon injury-induced SMC proliferation, resulting in reduced restenosis. Down-regulation of NFATc1 by its small interfering RNA inhibited PDGF-BB-induced cyclin A expression and DNA synthesis both in rat and human VSMC. Together, these findings demonstrate that the cyclin A-CDK2 complex may be a potential effector of NFATs, specifically NFATc1, in mediating SMC multiplication leading to neointima formation. Therefore, NFATs may be used as target molecules for the development of therapeutic agents against vascular diseases such as restenosis."
https://openalex.org/W2056394163,"Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules play vital roles during protein synthesis. Their acceptor arms are aminoacylated with specific amino acid residues while their anticodons delimit codon specificity. The history of these two functions has been generally linked in evolutionary studies of the genetic code. However, these functions could have been differentially recruited as evolutionary signatures were left embedded in tRNA molecules. Here we built phylogenies derived from the sequence and structure of tRNA, we forced taxa into monophyletic groups using constraint analyses, tested competing evolutionary hypotheses, and generated timelines of amino acid charging and codon discovery. Charging of Sec, Tyr, Ser and Leu appeared ancient, while specificities related to Asn, Met, and Arg were derived. The timelines also uncovered an early role of the second and then first codon bases, identified codons for Ala and Pro as the most ancient, and revealed important evolutionary take-overs related to the loss of the long variable arm in tRNA. The lack of correlation between ancestries of amino acid charging and encoding indicated that the separate discoveries of these functions reflected independent histories of recruitment. These histories were probably curbed by co-options and important take-overs during early diversification of the living world."

Previous characterization of fluorescence induction and decay kinetics by our laboratory documented defects on both the oxidizing and reducing sides of Photosystem II. Additionally, anomalous flash oxygen yield patterns indicated that the mutant contains a defective oxygen-evolving complex that appears to exhibit anomalously long-lived S2 and S3 oxidation states (Liu, H., Frankel, L. K., and Bricker, T. M. (2007) Biochemistry 46, 7607–7613). In this study, we have documented that the S2 and S3 states in psbo1 thylakoids decay very slowly. The total flash oxygen yield of the psbo1 mutant was also significantly reduced, as was its stability. Incubation of psbo1 thylakoids at high NaCl concentrations did not increase the rate of S2 and S3 state decay. The oxygen-evolving complexes of the mutant did, however, exhibit somewhat enhanced stability following this treatment. Incubation with CaCl2 had a significantly more dramatic effect. Under this condition, both the S2 and S3 states of the mutant decayed at nearly the same rate as the wild type, and the total oxygen yield and its stability following CaCl2 treatment were indistinguishable from that of the wild type. These results strongly suggest that the principal defect in the psbo1 mutant is an inability to effectively utilize the calcium associated with Photosystem II.

In higher plants and cyanobacteria at least six intrinsic proteins appear to be required for O2 evolution (1Murata N. Mijao M. Omata T. Matsunami H. Kuwabara T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 765: 363-369Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 2Bricker T.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4623-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 3Burnap R. Shen J.R. Jursinic P.A. Inoue Y. Sherman L.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7404-7410Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These are CP47, CP43, D1, D2, and the α and β subunits of cytochrome b559. Deletion of these subunits uniformly results in the loss of PS II function and assembly (4Bricker T.M. Ghanotakis D.F. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996: 113-136Google Scholar). Additionally, in higher plants, three extrinsic proteins, with apparent molecular masses of 33 kDa (PsbO), 24 kDa (PsbP), and 16 kDa (PsbQ), are also required for maximal rates of O2 evolution at physiological inorganic cofactor concentrations. Of these three proteins, the PsbO protein appears to play a central role in the stabilization of the manganese cluster, is essential for efficient and stable O2 evolution, and is required, along with PsbP, for photoautotrophic growth and PS II assembly in higher plants propagated under normal growth conditions (5Yi X. McChargue M. Laborde S.M. Frankel L.K. Bricker T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16170-16174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 6Yi X. Hargett S. Liu H. Frankel L.K. Bricker T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24833-24841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis thaliana, two genes that encode PsbO (psbO-1, At5g66570 and psbO-2, At3g50820) are normally expressed, yielding two different PsbO proteins (PsbO-1 and PsbO-2, respectively). A highly fluorescent mutant, psbo1, was recently identified in which a stop codon has been introduced in the psbO-1 gene by ethane methylsulfonate mutagenesis at amino acid residue 74 of the mature PsbO protein (Gln74 → Stop), which leads to the loss of this component (7Murakami R. Ifuku K. Takabayashi A. Shikanai T. Endo T. Sato F. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The mutant exhibits a lower variable fluorescence yield (FV/FM), lower rates of steady state O2 evolution, and retarded growth. It was demonstrated that PsbO-1 is the major isoform in the wild type under normal growth conditions and that in the psbo1 mutant the PsbO-2 protein is up-regulated in a semicompensatory manner. The mechanism that leads to the increased expression of the PsbO-2 protein in the psbo1 mutant is unclear at this time. Domain-swapping analysis followed by in vitro reconstitution experiments were interpreted as indicating that two amino acid differences between the PsbO-1 and PsbO-2 components, Val186 → Ser and Leu246 → Ile, could explain the functional differences between the two PsbO proteins (8Murakami R. Ifuku K. Takabayashi A. Shikanai T. Endo T. Sato F. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2165-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It was concluded that inherent functional defects of this component are responsible for the phenotype observed in the mutant psbo1. Further characterization by our laboratory (9Liu H. Frankel L.K. Bricker T.M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7607-7613Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) indicated that the psbo1 mutant possesses significant functional defects on both the reducing and oxidizing sides of the photosystem. During fluorescence induction, the psbo1 mutant exhibited an enhanced O-to-P transition. Additionally, the J-to-I transition accounted for a <2% rise of the total fluorescence yield, whereas in the wild type, this transition accounted for >30% of the total fluorescence yield. Analysis of the flash-induced fluorescence rise in the presence of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea indicated that in the wild type the ratio of PS IIα to PS IIβ reaction centers is ∼1.2, whereas in the mutant, the ratio is ∼0.3. Fluorescence decay kinetics in the absence of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea indicated that electron transfer to QB was significantly altered in the mutant. Fluorescence decay kinetics in the presence of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea indicated that the charge recombination between QA– and the higher S states of the oxygen-evolving complex was retarded. Interestingly, flash oxygen yield analysis indicated that, after 5 min of dark incubation, a higher proportion of PS II reaction centers were in the S2 and S3 states. In the wild type, 6 ± 8% of the oxygen-evolving PS II reaction centers were in the higher S states, whereas in the mutant, this value was 28 ± 8%. These latter two observations appeared to indicate that the higher S states were more stable in the psbo1 mutant than in the wild type. In this study, we performed a detailed analysis of the S2 and S3 state lifetimes in psbo1 and wild type thylakoid membranes. We also examined the total flash oxygen yield and its stability during incubation at room temperature. Our findings indicate that both the S2 and S3 states decay extremely slowly in psbo1. The oxygen-evolving complex in the psbo1 mutant is also quite unstable and rapidly loses its ability to evolve oxygen. Incubation of psbo1 thylakoids at a high NaCl concentration did not increase the rate of S2 and S3 state decay or the total oxygen yield, but the stability of the oxygen-evolving complex was somewhat enhanced. Incubation with a moderate concentration of CaCl2 had a significantly more dramatic effect. Under this condition, the S2 and S3 states of the mutant decayed nearly as rapidly as in the wild type. Additionally, the total flash oxygen yield and its stability in psbo1 following CaCl2 treatment were indistinguishable from the wild type. Steady state oxygen evolution experiments in large measure support these findings. These results strongly suggest that the principal defect in the psbo1 mutant is an inability to effectively utilize the calcium cofactor associated with PS II. We hypothesize that the Arabidopsis PsbO-2 protein cannot effectively sequester this ion in the vicinity of the oxygen-evolving site. Plant Materials—Seeds of wild type A. thaliana (var. Landsberg erecta) and the mutant psbo1 were germinated on potting mixture and grown at 19–22 °C under 50–80 μmol photons m–2 s–1 white light with an 8-h light/16-h dark diurnal cycle. This suppressed flowering and maximized the yield of leaf material. Only leaves of mature plants were used in these experiments. Flash Oxygen Yield Experiments—Thylakoids were isolated by grinding leaves in a blender with a buffer containing 0.45 m sorbitol, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.4. The homogenate was filtered through two layers of cheesecloth and one layer of Miracloth (Calbiochemical Co.), and the thylakoids were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C at 1500 × g. The membranes were then washed twice with 0.3 m sorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.6. The membranes were finally pelleted and applied to the platinum electrode as a thin paste. For treatment with 150 mm NaCl or 20 mm CaCl2, these salts were included in the wash buffer. In the case of CaCl2 treatment, the washed membranes were resuspended in 1 ml of wash buffer plus 20 mm CaCl2 and brought to 50 μm ionomycin (a calcium ionophore). After incubation for 5 min at 4 °C, the treated thylakoids were pelleted and applied to the platinum electrode as described above. The flash oxygen yield measurements were performed on a bare platinum electrode (Artesian Scientific Co., Urbana, IL). The samples were incubated briefly (30 s to 1 min) under fluorescent room light (∼5 μmol photons m–2 s–1) prior to the onset of the experiment to allow the equilibration of the S states and then dark-incubated for only 20 s (during the electrode polarization). The electrode was polarized at 0.73 V for 20 s, and a series of 16 saturating flashes was supplied by an integrated, computer-controlled xenon flash lamp (20 μs). The polarization was turned off, and the same sample was then incubated in the dark at room temperature for various lengths of time followed by additional flash series. The data were analyzed using a four-state, homogeneous model (10Meunier P.C. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 36: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Five- and six-state models that incorporated either an S–1 state or S–1 and S–2 states, respectively, uniformly failed to fit the data acquired from either wild type or mutant thylakoids. Prior to fitting, the raw oxygen yield data were normalized to the average oxygen yield obtained on flashes 13–16. It is important to note that standard methods for measuring S state lifetimes (11Messinger J. Schroder W.P. Renger G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7658-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Bricker T.M. Lowrance J. Sutton H. Frankel L.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11483-11489Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) could not be used in this study. The fact that the oxygen evolution of the mutant thylakoid membranes is very unstable in the absence of added calcium (see below), coupled with the fact that the S2 and S3 states are quite persistent during dark incubation (9Liu H. Frankel L.K. Bricker T.M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7607-7613Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), precludes the use of the long dark incubation periods normally used in such experiments. We consider our measurements to be semiquantitative and satisfactory for our comparative studies (but not sufficiently accurate for more detailed bioenergetic studies, such as those performed in Ref. 11Messinger J. Schroder W.P. Renger G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7658-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Steady State Oxygen Evolution—For these experiments, thylakoids were isolated as described above and resuspended in a small volume of wash buffer. Chlorophyll was measured by the method of Arnon (13Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oxygen evolution was measured polarographically in a Hansatech oxygen electrode at 22 °C in the wash buffer supplemented with 0.5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 0.5 mm dichlorobenzoquinone, and 10 mm ammonium chloride. The chlorophyll concentration was 10 μg/ml, and the light intensity was 2000 μmol photons m–2 s–1. In some experiments, 150 mm NaCl or 20 mm CaCl2 was added directly to the reaction mixture. In the CaCl2 experiments, the thylakoid membranes were pretreated with 50 μm ionomycin for 5 min in the dark. Fig. 1 shows examples of typical flash oxygen yield experiments performed for the wild type (Fig. 1A) and psbo1 mutant (Fig. 1B) under control cofactor conditions (10 mm chloride with no added calcium). Before the onset of these experiments, the samples were incubated in room light (5 μmol photons m–2 s–1) to allow mixing of the S states. The first flash series was performed after 20 s of dark incubation, which was required to allow polarization of the electrode. As expected, both wild type and mutant thylakoids exhibited large oxygen yields on the first and second flashes, indicating that a large proportion of PS II reaction centers (42–45%) were in the S2 + S3 states. Additional flash series were then performed after increasing intervals of dark incubation of the same sample. In the wild type (Fig. 1A), the oxygen yield observed on the first and second flashes decreased rapidly with increasing lengths of dark incubation. This indicates that the proportion of PS II reaction centers in the S2 and S3 states decreased rapidly with increasing length of dark incubation. After 960 s of dark incubation, <3% of the reaction centers were in the S2 + S3 states. In the mutant, a significantly different pattern was observed. Whereas the overall flash oxygen yield dropped substantially during the course of the experiment (see below), the proportion of reaction centers in the S2 + S3 states remained quite high (18%), even at the longest period of dark incubation. This indicates that the S2 and S3 states in the mutant are very long-lived, confirming our earlier observations (9Liu H. Frankel L.K. Bricker T.M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7607-7613Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 explicitly illustrates the decay of the S2 and S3 states of the wild type and psbo1 mutant under a variety of ionic conditions. Qualitatively, under the control conditions of 10 mm chloride and no added calcium, the S2 and S3 states decayed rapidly in the wild type but very slowly in the psbo1 mutant. The addition of 150 mm NaCl did not accelerate the rate of decay of these S states in the mutant. The addition of 20 mm CaCl2, however, nearly fully restored the S state decay characteristics in the mutant (a typical flash oxygen yield experiment for the mutant in the presence of 20 mm CaCl2 is shown in Fig. 1C). The addition of 150 mm NaCl or 20 mm CaCl2 had little effect on the decay rates of the S2 and S3 states of the wild type (data not shown). In spinach, which possesses only a single PsbO protein isoform, chemical removal of this component from PS II membranes leads to increased lifetimes for the S2 and S3 states (14Miyao M. Murata M. Lavorel J. Maison-Petri B. Boussac A. Etienne A.-L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 890: 151-159Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and a marked slowing of the S3 → [S4] → S0 transition (14Miyao M. Murata M. Lavorel J. Maison-Petri B. Boussac A. Etienne A.-L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 890: 151-159Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 15Ono T.-A. Inoue Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 806: 331-340Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These preparations also exhibit a large loss (75%) of steady state oxygen evolution capability, with high concentrations of calcium and chloride being required to observe even this low activity (2Bricker T.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4623-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 16Miyao M. Murata N. FEBS Lett. 1984; 170: 350-354Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Additionally, in these experiments, the PsbO protein appears to lower the calcium requirement for oxygen evolution by at least a factor of 2 (2Bricker T.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4623-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained for the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803 in mutants from which the single PsbO protein present had been genetically deleted (3Burnap R. Shen J.R. Jursinic P.A. Inoue Y. Sherman L.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7404-7410Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Vass I. Cool K.M. Zsuzsanra D. Mayes S.R. Barber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 195-201Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Whereas these mutants can grow photoautotrophically in standard BG-11 medium (albeit more slowly and with lower oxygen evolution rates), they cannot grow in either calcium-depleted (18Philbrick J.B. Diner B.A. Zilinskas B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13370-13376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or chloride-depleted (19Engels D.H. Lott A. Schmid G.H. Pistorious E.K. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 42: 227-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) medium. These findings indicate that, in vivo, the PsbO protein modulates the utilization of calcium in support of normal oxygen-evolving activity. Flash oxygen yield measurements on the Synechocystis ΔpsbO mutant also indicated that the S2 and S3 states are stabilized and that the S3 → [S4] → S0 transition is strongly retarded (3Burnap R. Shen J.R. Jursinic P.A. Inoue Y. Sherman L.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7404-7410Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Mutants containing alterations in other PS II components that cannot bind the PsbO protein normally exhibit similar characteristics (Ref. 21Putnam-Evans C. Wu J. Burnap R. Whitmarsh J. Bricker T.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4046-4053Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar; for an in-depth review, see Ref. 22Popelkova H. Yocum C.F. Photosynth. Res. 2007; 93: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the PsbO-2 protein that is present in the psbo1 mutant is defective in supporting normal operation of the oxygen-evolving complex. Our in vitro characterization of mutant thylakoids indicates that loss of the PsbO-1 protein results in a modified oxygen-evolving complex, which exhibits S state characteristics similar to those obtained by the chemical removal of the PsbO component from higher plant oxygen-evolving membranes and to cyanobacterial cells from which the PsbO protein had been removed genetically. It should be emphasized here, however, that the PsbO-2 protein is, at least, partially functional. The psbo1 mutant grows photoautotrophically (albeit slowly) and can set seed. If the PsbO-2 protein were fully nonfunctional, we would expect the psbo1 mutant to be unable to grow photoautotrophically, as we had observed previously in Arabidopsis that contained RNA interference designed to suppress the expression of both PsbO-1 and PsbO-2 simultaneously (5Yi X. McChargue M. Laborde S.M. Frankel L.K. Bricker T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16170-16174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A illustrates the total flash oxygen yield of wild type and psbo1 thylakoids. This was estimated by summing the oxygen yields obtained on the first four flashes after a 20-s dark incubation period for the wild type and mutant under various treatment regimes. The oxygen yield for the wild type was essentially constant for untreated, NaCl-treated, and CaCl2-treated thylakoids. However, the psbo1 thylakoids exhibited a significantly different pattern. Under control and elevated NaCl conditions, the mutant exhibited oxygen yields ∼50% of that observed in the wild type. However, treatment with CaCl2 increased the total oxygen yield to near wild type values. This result was quite surprising. Previously, Murakami et al. (7Murakami R. Ifuku K. Takabayashi A. Shikanai T. Endo T. Sato F. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) reported that the psbo1 mutant accumulated fewer PS II reaction centers (∼75% of the wild type for mature leaves) as measured by immunoquantification of the D1 protein. Consequently, it would be expected that the maximal observable total oxygen yield of the mutant would be 75% of wild type values. However, such an analysis does not take into account the large variability that Murakami et al. (7Murakami R. Ifuku K. Takabayashi A. Shikanai T. Endo T. Sato F. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) observed in their measurements of D1. Our observation of near wild type total oxygen yield in the mutant is fully consistent with Murakami et al. (7Murakami R. Ifuku K. Takabayashi A. Shikanai T. Endo T. Sato F. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), given the level of variability that they report. In Fig. 3B, the stability of the total flash oxygen yield of wild type and psbo1 thylakoids at room temperature was examined. The total oxygen yield of wild type thylakoids was quite stable, with ∼70% of the total oxygen yield being retained after 16 min of incubation. The psbo1 thylakoids were, however, very unstable, retaining only 20% of their oxygen yield over the same time period. Treatment of the psbo1 thylakoids with 150 mm NaCl marginally increased the stability of the oxygen yield. However, treatment of the mutant thylakoids with 20 mm CaCl2 dramatically increased the stability of the total flash oxygen yield such that it was indistinguishable from wild type thylakoids. The increase in the total flash oxygen yield observed after CaCl2 treatment of the mutant thylakoids is, in large measure, also reflected in steady state oxygen evolution measurements (Fig. 4). No significant differences were observed in the oxygen evolution rate of wild type thylakoids upon the addition of either NaCl or CaCl2. However, addition of CaCl2 to mutant thylakoids significantly increased the oxygen evolution rate by ∼30%. These results indicate that the defect in the psbo1 mutant affects the ability of the mutant to effectively utilize calcium in support of oxygen evolution, both with respect to total flash oxygen yield and the oxygen evolution rates measured under steady state conditions. Interestingly, the addition of high concentrations of chloride did not appear to restore the total flash oxygen yield of psbo1, nor did it improve the steady state oxygen evolution rates of this mutant. Earlier studies on the psbo1 mutant indicated that the absence of PsbO-1 led to a decrease in PS II variable fluorescence yield (FV/FM) to between 70 and 90% of wild type levels (8Murakami R. Ifuku K. Takabayashi A. Shikanai T. Endo T. Sato F. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2165-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Additionally, as noted above, an apparent decrease in assembled PS II reaction centers was observed (monitored by a decrease in the amount of the D1 protein). Our observation that the addition of CaCl2 to mutant thylakoids restored the total oxygen yield to near wild type levels may indicate that the lower quantum yield observed in vivo (8Murakami R. Ifuku K. Takabayashi A. Shikanai T. Endo T. Sato F. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2165-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was principally due to PS II reaction centers that were defective in the sequestration of calcium. It should be noted that whereas in our steady state oxygen evolution measurements the psbo1 rates were significantly increased, they did not achieve wild type levels. This highlights a major difference between flash oxygen yield measurements and steady state experiments. During a steady state experiment, the samples are exposed to saturating light intensities for at least 1 min, whereas during a flash oxygen yield experiment, the sample is exposed to saturating light for <0.5 ms. We hypothesize that the lower level of activity restoration observed in the steady state experiment possibly indicates an increased rate of photoinactivation in the mutant that is not fully complemented by increased calcium concentrations. Our observations demonstrate that the Arabidopsis psbo1 mutant thylakoids exhibit long-lived S2 and S3 states, lower total oxygen yields, lower stability of the oxygen-evolving complex, and depressed steady state rates of oxygen evolution. These results are very similar to those obtained by the chemical removal of the PsbO protein from higher plant PS II membranes and to those obtained from genetic deletion of the single psbO gene present in Synechocystis. Our results indicate that the PsbO-2 protein, the only PsbO protein present in the psbo1 mutant, is defective in supporting normal operation of the oxygen-evolving complex, even though this protein appears to bind normally to PS II membranes (8Murakami R. Ifuku K. Takabayashi A. Shikanai T. Endo T. Sato F. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2165-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Additionally, the majority of the defects we observed in the psbo1 mutant thylakoids can be nearly fully reversed by calcium in the presence of moderate chloride concentrations. These findings indicate that the PsbO-2 protein is defective in the utilization of these cofactors in support of normal oxygen evolution activity. Consequently, comparisons between the PsbO-1 and PsbO-2 proteins should yield important insights into the function of the competent PsbO-1 protein. PsbO-2 is very similar to PsbO-1, containing only 11 amino acid substitutions (7Murakami R. Ifuku K. Takabayashi A. Shikanai T. Endo T. Sato F. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23Bricker T.M. Burnap R.L. Wydrzynski T. Satoh K. Photosystem II: The Water/Plastoquinone Oxido-Reductase of Photosynthesis. Springer, Dordrecht, the Netherlands2005: 95-120Google Scholar), the majority of which are conservative replacements. Murakami et al. (8Murakami R. Ifuku K. Takabayashi A. Shikanai T. Endo T. Sato F. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2165-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) generated Escherichia coli-expressed chimeric PsbO-1/PsbO-2 proteins and evaluated their ability to reconstitute steady state oxygen-evolving activity in NaCl/urea-washed spinach PS II membranes. They concluded that the observed defects in steady state oxygen evolution rates were due to amino acid substitutions in the C-terminal domain of PsbO-2, specifically the Val186 → Ser and/or Leu246 → Ile substitutions. If their observations are correct, then these residues are responsible either directly or indirectly for the loss of the ability of PsbO-2 to utilize calcium. It should be noted, however, that these steady state oxygen evolution experiments were apparently performed at high calcium and chloride concentrations during the oxygen evolution assays (due to the absence of the PsbP and PsbQ components). Although these authors did not specify the ionic cofactor concentrations used during their assays, they did tangentially cite Betts et al. (24Betts S.D. Ross J.R. Pichersky E. Yocum C.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4047-4053Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), who included 20 mm Ca2+ and 100 mm Cl– in their assay buffer. It is probable that, under conditions of elevated calcium and chloride, the full extent of the defects associated with only PsbO-2-containing reaction centers would not have been observed (8Murakami R. Ifuku K. Takabayashi A. Shikanai T. Endo T. Sato F. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2165-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Consequently, it is possible that other residues that are present in PsbO-1 but replaced in PsbO-2 may be important with respect to the maintenance of calcium at the active site. What is the nature of the defect in the PsbO-2 protein? Our observations indicate that the PsbO-2 protein cannot maintain normal levels of calcium in the vicinity of the oxygen-evolving site. Previously, we suggested that the PsbO protein, in concert with the large extrinsic loops of CP47 and CP43, formed a “sequestered domain” for maintaining high concentrations of chloride in the vicinity of the oxygen-evolving site (25Bricker T.M. Frankel L.K. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 56: 157-173Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Experimental support for this suggestion was recently provided (26Popelkova H. Betts S.D. Lydakis Simantiris N. Im M.M. Swenson E. Yocum C.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3107-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our current results indicate that a fully functional PsbO protein is also required for the normal sequestration of calcium at the oxygen-evolving site (for an alternative viewpoint, however, see Ref. 27Seidler A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1277: 35-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). One possible hypothesis consistent with the psbo1 phenotype would be that the PsbO-2 protein cannot support a stable, high affinity structural association of PsbP and PsbQ with PS II. It has been shown that the PsbO protein is required for binding of the PsbP component and that PsbP is required for binding of the PsbQ protein (28Andersson B. Larsson C. Jansson C. Ljungberg U. Akerlund H.-E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 766: 21-26Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 29Kavelaki K. Ghanotakis D.F. Photosynth. Res. 1991; 29: 149-155PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, we have identified carboxylates on the PsbO protein that are required for PsbP binding (30Bricker T.M. Frankel L.K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2056-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Decreased binding affinity of these two components would lead to lowered affinity for both calcium and chloride at the oxygen-evolving site (for reviews see Refs. 20Miqyass M. van Gorkom H.J. Yocum C.F. Photosynth. Res. 2007; 92: 275-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar and 22Popelkova H. Yocum C.F. Photosynth. Res. 2007; 93: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the PsbP and PsbQ proteins can structurally associate normally with PsbO-2-containing PS II reaction centers but that the functional interaction between either PsbO-2 and PsbP/PsbQ or PsbO-2 and intrinsic membrane protein components of the photosystem is compromised. Finally, it is possible that the PsbO-2 protein alone cannot support normal assembly of PS II and that the defective photosystem that does assemble cannot effectively sequester calcium at the active site. Our earlier studies (5Yi X. McChargue M. Laborde S.M. Frankel L.K. Bricker T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16170-16174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) indicated that the PsbO component is required for normal assembly of PS II. We did not, however, examine the relative efficiencies of PsbO-1 versus PsbO-2 in support of normal photosystem assembly. Experimental differentiation among these and other hypotheses is ongoing. The psbo1 mutant exhibits significant defects in its ability to evolve oxygen. Steady state oxygen evolution rates are depressed, total flash oxygen yield is significantly lower, oxygen yeild stability is markedly decreased, and the dark decay of both the S2 and S3 states is significantly retarded. The majority of these defects are nearly fully reversed by moderate concentrations of CaCl2. These results indicate that the PsbO-2 protein, the only PsbO protein present in the psbo1 mutant, leads to a defect in the ability of PS II to utilize calcium in support of oxygen evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2089584304,"MALDI profiling and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) are novel techniques for direct analysis of peptides and small proteins in biological tissues. In this work we applied them to the study of Anopheles gambiae antennae, with the aim of analysing expression of soluble proteins involved in olfaction perireceptor events. MALDI spectra obtained by direct profiling on single antennae and by the analysis of extracts, showed similar profiles, although spectra obtained through profiling had a richer ion population and higher signal to noise ratio. Male and female antennae showed distinct protein profiles. MALDI imaging experiments were also performed and differences were observed in the localization of some proteins. Two proteins were identified through high resolution measurement and top-down MS/MS experiments. A 8 kDa protein only present in the male antennae matched with an unannotated sequence of the An. gambiae genome, while the presence of odorant binding protein 9 (OBP-9) was confirmed through experiments of 2-DE, followed by MS and MS/MS analysis of digested spots. This work shows that MALDI MS profiling is a technique suitable for the analysis of proteins of small and medium MW in insect appendices, and allows obtaining data for several specimens which can be investigated for differences between groups. Proteins of interest can be identified through other complementary MS approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2155067147,"Some ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain-containing proteins are known to play roles in receptor trafficking. Alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) undergo constitutive cycling between the intracellular compartment and the cell surface in the central nervous system. However, the function of UBL domain-containing proteins in the recycling of the AMPARs to the synaptic surface has not yet been reported. Here, we report that the Transmembrane and ubiquitin-like domain-containing 1 (Tmub1) protein, formerly known as the Hepatocyte Odd Protein Shuttling (HOPS) protein, which is abundantly expressed in the brain and which exists in a synaptosomal membrane fraction, facilitates the recycling of the AMPAR subunit GluR2 to the cell surface. Neurons transfected with Tmub1/HOPS-RNAi plasmids showed a significant reduction in the AMPAR current as compared to their control neurons. Consistently, the synaptic surface expression of GluR2, but not of GluR1, was significantly decreased in the neurons transfected with the Tmub1/HOPS-RNAi and increased in the neurons overexpressing EGFP-Tmub1/HOPS. The altered surface expression of GluR2 was speculated to be due to the altered surface-recycling of the internalized GluR2 in our recycling assay. Eventually, we found that GluR2 and glutamate receptor interacting protein (GRIP) were coimmunoprecipitated by the anti-Tmub1/HOPS antibody from the mouse brain. Taken together, these observations show that the Tmub1/HOPS plays a role in regulating basal synaptic transmission; it contributes to maintain the synaptic surface number of the GluR2-containing AMPARs by facilitating the recycling of GluR2 to the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2058282865,"The LytC lysozyme belongs to the autolytic system of Streptococcus pneumoniae and carries out a slow autolysis with optimum activity at 30 degrees C. Like all pneumococcal murein hydrolases, LytC is a modular enzyme. Its mature form comprises a catalytic module belonging to the GH25 family of glycosyl-hydrolases and a cell wall binding module (CBM), made of 11 sequence repeats, that is essential for activity and specifically targets choline residues present in pneumococcal lipoteichoic and teichoic acids. Here we show that the catalytic module is natively folded, and its thermal denaturation takes place at 45.4 degrees C. However, the CBM is intrinsically unstable, and the ultimate folding and stabilization of the active, monomeric form of LytC relies on choline binding. The complex formation proceeds in a rather slow way, and all sites (8.0 +/- 0.5 sites/monomer) behave as equivalent (Kd = 2.7 +/- 0.3 mm). The CBM stabilization is, nevertheless, marginal, and irreversible denaturation becomes measurable at 37 degrees C even at high choline concentration, compromising LytC activity. In contrast, the Cpl-1 lysozyme, a homologous endolysin encoded by pneumococcal Cp-1 bacteriophage, is natively folded in the absence of choline and has maximum activity at 37 degrees C. Choline binding is fast and promotes Cpl-1 dimerization. Coupling between choline binding and folding of the CBM of LytC indicates a high conformational plasticity that could correlate with the unusual alternation of short and long choline-binding repeats present in this enzyme. Moreover, it can contribute to regulate LytC activity by means of a tight, complementary binding to the pneumococcal envelope, a limited motility, and a moderate resistance to thermal denaturation that could also account for its activity versus temperature profile."
https://openalex.org/W2074286346,"A major limitation of chromatin immunoprecipitation lies in the challenge of measuring the immunoprecipitation effectiveness of different proteins and antibodies and the resultant inability to compare the occupancies of different DNA-binding proteins. Here we present the implementation of a quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation assay in the RNA polymerase III (pol III) system that allowed us to measure the absolute <i>in vivo</i> occupancy of pol III and its two transcription factors, TFIIIC and TFIIIB, on a subset of pol III genes. The crucial point of our analysis was devising a method that allows the accurate determination of the immunoprecipitation efficiency for each protein. We achieved this by spiking every immunoprecipitation reaction with the formaldehyde cross-linked <i>in vitro</i> counterparts of TFIIIB-, TFIIIC-, and pol III-DNA complexes, measuring the <i>in vitro</i> occupancies of the corresponding factors on a DNA probe and determining probe recovery by quantitative PCR. Analysis of nine pol III-transcribed genes with diverse sequence characteristics showed a very high occupancy by TFIIIB and pol III (pol III occupancy being generally ∼70% of TFIIIB occupancy) and a TFIIIC occupancy that ranged between ∼5 and 25%. Current data suggest that TFIIIC is released during transcription <i>in vitro</i>, and it has been proposed that TFIIIB suffices for pol III recruitment <i>in vivo</i>. Our findings point to the transient nature of the TFIIIC-DNA interaction <i>in vivo</i>, with no significant counter-correlation between pol III and TFIIIC occupancy and instead to a dependence of TFIIIB-DNA and TFIIIC-DNA complex maintenance <i>in vivo</i> on pol III function."
https://openalex.org/W2025178332,"Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are a large and ubiquitous family of enzymes that specifically transfer sugar moieties to a range of substrates.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, is a devastating bacterial pathogen, and infection by M. tuberculosis continues to be common particularly in developing countries, with particular strains becoming resistant to multiple frontline drugs. The pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis is partly attributable to its waxy cell wall that consists of covalently linked layers of peptidoglycan, arabinogalactan, and mycolic acids (for a review, see Crick et al. (1Crick D.C. Mahapatra S. Brennan P.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 107R-118RCrossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar)), interspersed with lipids and glycolipids, and capped with polysaccharides (2Daffe M. Draper P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the major importance to the biology of Mycobacterium sp. and other Corynebacterineae, the biosynthetic pathways for many of these carbohydrates are poorly understood, although it is established that the most prolific class of enzymes involved in these pathways are the glycosyltransferases (GTs) 3The abbreviations used are: GT, glycosyltransferase; MGS, mannosylglycerate synthase; MAD, multiple anomalous dispersion. (3Berg S. Kaur D. Jackson M. Brennan P.J. Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 35R-56RCrossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Indeed, there are 41 known or putative GTs in M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv listed in the CAZy (carbohydrate-active enzyme) data base, representing over 1% of the 3900 open reading frames in the M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome (4Wimmerova M. Engelsen S.B. Bettler E. Breton C. Imberty A. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 691-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Ethambutol, a front line anti-tuberculosis drug, targets the EmbA and EmbB GTs that synthesize the arabinogalactan cell wall layer, thereby marking GTs as promising new drug targets. GTs transfer sugar moieties from the activated donor substrate, mostly in the form of a nucleoside-diphospho-sugar, to a myriad of specific acceptor substrates to generate innumerable oligosaccharide and glycoconjugate products that are often required for species- or cell specific processes. GTs are classified as either “inverting” or “retaining,” depending on whether the stereochemistry of the anomeric carbon is retained or inverted in the product relative to that in the donor substrate. Moreover, despite the sequence diversity within the GT superfamily, GT structures solved to date adopt one of two common folds, termed “GT-A” or “GT-B.” Both of these folds adopt the “Rossmann-like fold,” with the GT-A fold containing a single Rossman-like or nucleotide-binding domain (5Rossmann M.G. Moras D. Olsen K.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar) and the GT-B fold containing two similar Rossmann-like domains. Moreover, members within a particular GT family are predicted to share the same inverting or retaining mechanism and GT-A or GT-B fold. Furthermore, GTs of the GT-A fold that utilize a nucleoside-diphospho-sugar typically contain a “DXD” (or XDD or EXD) motif that is involved in metal ion-mediated activated donor substrate coordination and is also required for catalytic activity (6Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In contrast to the abundance of GT sequences available, there is a lack of functional, mechanistic, and structural data on these enzymes. This paucity of biochemical data reflects the difficulty in characterizing enzymes with countless possible combinations of donor and acceptor substrates and products. Indeed, only 29 of the 90 GT families have representative structures solved. The vast majority of sequences uncovered by genomic analyses that show distant sequence identity to known GTs are thus grouped into large “polyspecific” families. For example, the rapidly growing GT2 family is the largest such family, with over 10,000 known and candidate members, and is considered the ancestral inverting family from which all GTs that share the GT-A fold have evolved (7Martinez-Fleites C. Proctor M. Roberts S. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 1143-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The spore coat polysaccharide biosynthesis protein (SpsA) from Bacillus subtilis (8Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6380-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), which adopts the GT-A fold, remains the only representative of the GT2 family whose structure is solved. Due to the versatility of the GT-A fold, “rules” for discerning the substrate specificity and discriminating the mechanism of GTs that exhibit this fold remain elusive. To further our understanding of this family of GTs and to characterize new anti-tuberculosis drug targets, we investigated Rv1208, an essential enzyme (9Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar) implicated in the biosynthesis of the oligosaccharide- and glycoconjugate-rich M. tuberculosis cell wall. As a candidate member of the GT2 family, Rv1208 is predicted to use an inverting mechanism, Mn2+ and a nucleoside-diphospho-sugar as its activated donor substrate. We have determined the crystal structure of MAP2569c from Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, a close homologue (83% sequence identity) to Rv1208. We reveal that MAP2569c possesses the GT-A fold and exhibits specificity toward the donor substrate, UDP-glucose. Production and Crystallization of MAP2569c—Detailed methods used for the cloning, overexpression, purification, and crystallization of MAP2569c have been published previously (10Fulton Z.

MAP2569c crystallized in space group P41212 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 86.6 Å and c = 104.3 Å. There is one monomer in the asymmetric unit corresponding to a solvent content of ∼54% (v/v).

Solvent density (1.005 g/ml at 20 °C) and viscosity (1.021 cp) as well as estimates of the partial specific volume of MAP2569c (0.74 ml/g) were computed using the program SEDNTERP (18Cole J.L. Lary J.W. T P.M. Laue T.M. Methods Cell Biol. 2008; 84: 143-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity data at multiple time points were fitted to a single discrete species or a continuous size distribution model (19Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar) using the program SEDFIT, which is available on the World Wide Web. Enzyme Activity—The nucleotide-sugar specificity of MAP2569c was determined by a continuous linked enzyme assay described by Grosselin et al. (20Gosselin S. Alhussaini M. Streiff M.B. Takabayashi K. Palcic M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The 200-μl reaction (carried out at 37 °C) consisted of 13 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, buffer containing 10 mm MnCl2, 13 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 13 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.7 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.6 mm NADH, 1 unit of pyruvate kinase, 1.23 units of lactate dehydrogenase, 10 mm 3-phosphoglycerate (the acceptor molecule), and 1 mm NDP-sugar. The amount of protein varied between 0.5 and 2.5 μg/ml. The decrease in NADH was continuously measured at 340 nm using a Fluostar Optima plate reader (BMG Labtech). Specific activity was calculated by the change of absorbance over time using an excitation coefficient of NADH of 6.22 mm cm-1. Crystal Structure of MAP2569c—Although Rv1208 was insoluble, the expression of its close homologue, MAP2569c, yielded soluble protein that was amenable for structural studies (10Fulton Z. Crellin P.K. Brammananth R. Zaker-Tabrizi L. Coppel R.L. Rossjohn J. Beddoe T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2008; 64: 428-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We subsequently determined the crystal structure of apo-MAP2569c using the MAD technique (see “Experimental Procedures” and Table 1). The structure was refined to 1.85 Å to Rfactor and Rfree values of 18.4 and 19.8%, respectively (see Table 2). The MAP2569c (329 amino acids, 34.8 kDa) protomer is globular (∼65 × 45 × 40 Å) and rich in α-helices (Fig. 1, A and B). At the core of MAP2569c is a mixed nine-stranded twisted β-sheet (sA) with topology β5-β4-β3-β6-β8-β7-β9-β2-β1(β1 and β7 are antiparallel), flanked by three helical segments on either side. As expected from its low sequence similarity to the GT2 family, MAP2569c contained the GT-A scaffold observed in SpsA (8Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6380-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1, A and B) and can be subdivided into an N-terminal domain, “catalytic” domain, and C-terminal domain. The catalytic domain of MAP2569c (residues 50-260) exhibited the characteristic α/β/α architecture of the GT-A fold, which is subdivided into “nucleotide-binding” (residues 50-138) and “acceptor-binding” (residues 142-260) subdomains. The nucleotide-binding subdomain of MAP2569c comprised the “Rossmann-like” fold (5Rossmann M.G. Moras D. Olsen K.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar) with four parallel β-strands (β5-β4-β3-β6), interspersed with helices (see Fig. 1, A and B). The acceptor-binding subdomain contained three antiparallel β-strands (β8-β7-β9), also separated by helices, and a disordered region (residues 174-188). The signature catalytic DXD motif of the GT-A fold is found, as expected, at the juncture of the two catalytic subdomains and comprised Asp-139-Ser-140-Asp-141. A second small antiparallel β-sheet (sB), perpendicular to the central β-sheet (sA), is formed by two short β-stands: β6′ at the N terminus of the acceptor-binding subdomain and β9′ within a short loop bridging the acceptor-binding subdomain and C-terminal domain. This loop (residues 261-267) sat adjacent to the DXD motif and traced the nucleotide-binding/acceptor-binding subdomain divide. The C-terminal domain (residues 268-329) contained a long helical region and a prominent antiparallel two-stranded twisted β-sheet (sC; β11-β10) rich in aromatic residues. Although there was a monomer in the asymmetric unit, a crystallographic dimer was observed in which this unusual C-terminal tail wrapped around its 2-fold related partner (see Fig. 1C). The remainder of this dimeric interface is formed by residues in the long helical region at the start of the C-terminal domain and in the N-terminal domain and acceptor-binding subdomain. The buried surface area at this dimeric interface was quite extensive (∼1900 Å2) and is therefore likely to represent a biological dimer. Supporting this assertion are AUC studies of MAP2569c, which was shown to be a dimer in aqueous solution (see supplemental Fig. 1 and supplemental Table 1). Given the location of the substrate-binding sites, it appears that the MAP2569c dimer is probably required for stability as opposed to catalysis. Accordingly, the dimeric MAP2569c exhibits a GT-A fold and DXD motif consistent with GT activity. Comparison of the GT-A Fold of MAP2569c with Other Glycosyltransferases—We next compared the GT-A fold of MAP2569c to other structures in the PDB using the DALI server (21Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) and identified a number of nucleotide-binding proteins with similar architecture. The closest structural match (with a Z-score of 18.6) was to the catalytic domain of mannosylglycerate synthase (MGS) from Rhodothermus marinus (22Flint J. Taylor E. Yang M. Bolam D.N. Tailford L.E. Martinez-Fleites C. Dodson E.J. Davis B.G. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 2bo4, 181 Cα atoms; root mean square deviation of 2.0 Å, and 22% sequence identity). Based on sequence similarity, MGS was previously classified as a member of the GT2 family (23Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar); however, MGS was subsequently shown to use a retaining mechanism and was reclassified as the founding member of the GT78 family (22Flint J. Taylor E. Yang M. Bolam D.N. Tailford L.E. Martinez-Fleites C. Dodson E.J. Davis B.G. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The next two closest structural homologues from the GT superfamily (with Z-scores of 13.5 and 12.4, respectively) belong to SpsA from B. subtilis (8Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6380-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1qg8, 166 Cα atoms, root mean square deviation of 3.4 Å and 13% sequence identity) and polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases from Homo sapiens (24Fritz T.A. Hurley J.H. Trinh L.B. Shiloach J. Tabak L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15307-15312Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 2ffu, 171 Cα atoms, root mean square deviation of 3.0 Å, and 16% sequence identity). As with MGS, polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase was initially grouped with SpsA in the GT2 family but has since been shown to use a retaining mechanism and was subsequently reclassified as a member of the GT27 family (19Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar, 21Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar). Of the 20 highest structural matches to the GT-A fold of MAP2569c, only six are GTs. Consequently, the GT-A fold of MAP2569c shows highest structural homology to the catalytic domain of a GT with a retaining mechanism and displays significant structural homology to other nucleotide-binding protein families. This structural similarity of MAP2569c to other nucleotide-binding protein families is indicative of both the structural diversity of and lack of structural data for this rapidly growing class of enzymes. Nucleotide Binding—As a candidate member of the GT2 family, MAP2569c is predicted to use Mn2+ and a nucleotide-sugar as its activated donor substrate (23Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we sought to define the nucleotide specificity of this enzyme. First, we screened for nucleotide binding via a crystallographic approach. A crystallography-based approach has previously been applied with other GTs to identify the donor sugar (25Zhang Y. Xiang Y. Van Etten J.L. Rossmann M.G. Structure. 2007; 15: 1031-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Namely, we soaked 10 mm CMP, GDP, and UDP nucleotides into the apocrystal form. The difference Fourier electron density maps calculated using these data (statistics not shown) revealed evidence for UDP only and not for CMP or GDP at the predicted donor substrate site of MAP2569c and thus indicated that UDP is the likely nucleotide component of the donor substrate for MAP2569c. We subsequently determined the 2.3 Å resolution structure of MAP2569c in complex with its donor substrate product, Mn2+·UDP, at pH 7.0 and refined it to Rfactor and Rfree values of 19.3 and 21.7%, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 2A). Overall, the structure of MAP2569c is unchanged on binding UDP, although a major conformational change was observed in the loop (residues 261-267) linking the acceptor-binding subdomain and C-terminal domain (see below). The α- and β-phosphates on UDP interact with Asp-141Oδ2 of the DXD motif via the Mn2+ ion (Fig. 3A), as observed previously in the SpsA structure (6Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In addition, His-263Nδ1 on the loop linking the acceptor-binding subdomain and C-terminal domain also coordinates the Mn2+ ion. Theα-phosphate also hydrogen-bonds to Tyr-234Oη, and the β-phosphate forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond with Asp-139Oδ2 and is further within van der Waals contact of the side chains of Met-274 and Arg-266.FIGURE 3NDP-sugar specificity for MAP2569c. Relative activity of MAP2569c in the presence of different donor NDP-sugars and the acceptor molecule, 3-phosphoglycerate (33Empadinhas N. Albuquerque L. Mendes V. Macedo-Ribeiro S. da Costa M.S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2008; 280: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).

The O2 on the uracil hydrogen-bonds to one of the two alternate conformations modeled for Ser-86Oγ. In addition to these contacts with the nucleotide-binding subdomain, the uracil is also in van der Waals contact with Tyr-234 on the 310-helix hL. The ribose ring of UDP formed van der Waals contacts with the side chains of Pro-55, Lys-119, and Tyr-234. The O2* on the ribose hydrogen-bonds to Leu-57N and the carboxylates of Glu-59, and the O3* hydrogen-bonds to Pro-55O. The ribose ring further interacts with the conserved DXD motif, with the O3* also hydrogen-bonding to the Ser-140N,Oγ. Thus, the large number of contacts between MAP2569c and UDP provided a basis for its specificity for this nucleotide. MAP2569c Complexed with UDP-glucose—To identify what UDP-sugar MAP2569c could bind, a similar co-crystallization approach was employed. UDP-activated sugars that act as natural donor substrates for GTs include UDP-GalNAc, UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-α-l-arabinose, UDP-Gal, UDP-Glc, UDP-α-d-glucuronic acid, and UDP-α-d-xylose (although only UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-Gal, and UDP-Glc have been found in mycobacteria, all natural UDP-sugar donor substrates were investigated for comparison). For all crystal structures solved using these UDP-sugars, there was electron density for at least the uracil ring of the UDP-sugar at the predicted donor substrate site of MAP2569c. For example, the complex with UDP-GlcNAc was refined to 2.2 Å to Rfactor and Rfree values of 18.8 and 20.5%, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures” and Tables 1 and 2) and revealed evidence for the uracil and ribose rings and α-phosphate of the UDP-sugar (see supplemental Fig. 2). However, only in the complex with UDP-Glc was electron density also observed for Mn2+, the β-phosphate, and the sugar moiety (see below) (Fig. 2B) at the predicted donor substrate site. This suggests specificity for UDP-Glc over all other natural, including chemically related, UDP-sugars. Second, to further verify this specificity, the enzyme activity of MAP2569c was analyzed with the UDP-sugars found in mycobacteria, UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-Gal, and UDP-Glc. The highest activity was observed with UDP-Glc, with no activity toward UDP-Gal or UDP-GlcNAc (Fig. 3), suggesting that MAP2569c uses UDP-Glc as its natural donor sugar. There was some residual activity observed with GDP-Glc (20% of that observed with UDP-Glc), suggesting that there is some plasticity in donor sugar binding (Fig. 3). UDP-Glc sat in a “folded back” conformation at the putative donor site, reminiscent of the conformation first observed in a donor substrate analogue in complex with the retaining GT LgtC (26Persson K.

https://openalex.org/W2079931811,"Post-transcriptional modification is a ubiquitous feature of ribosomal RNA in all kingdoms of life. Modified nucleotides are generally clustered in functionally important regions of the ribosome, but the functional contribution to protein synthesis is not well understood. Here we describe high resolution crystal structures for the N(2)-guanine methyltransferase RsmC that modifies residue G1207 in 16 S rRNA near the decoding site of the 30 S ribosomal subunit. RsmC is a class I S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase composed of two methyltransferase domains. However, only one S-adenosyl-L-methionine molecule and one substrate molecule, guanosine, bind in the ternary complex. The N-terminal domain does not bind any cofactor. Two structures with bound S-adenosyl-L-methionine and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine confirm that the cofactor binding mode is highly similar to other class I methyltransferases. Secondary structure elements of the N-terminal domain contribute to cofactor-binding interactions and restrict access to the cofactor-binding site. The orientation of guanosine in the active site reveals that G1207 has to disengage from its Watson-Crick base pairing interaction with C1051 in the 16 S rRNA and flip out into the active site prior to its modification. Inspection of the 30 S crystal structure indicates that access to G1207 by RsmC is incompatible with the native subunit structure, consistent with previous suggestions that this enzyme recognizes a subunit assembly intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1968966170,"Disulfide bonding contributes to the function and antigenicity of many viral envelope glycoproteins. We assessed here its significance for the hepatitis C virus E2 envelope protein and a counterpart deleted for hypervariable region-1 (HVR1). All 18 cysteine residues of the antigens were involved in disulfides. Chemical reduction of up to half of these disulfides was compatible with anti-E2 monoclonal antibody reaction, CD81 receptor binding, and viral entry, whereas complete reduction abrogated these properties. The addition of 5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid had no effect on viral entry. Thus, E2 function is only weakly dependent on its redox status, and cell entry does not require redox catalysts, in contrast to a number of enveloped viruses. Because E2 is a major neutralizing antibody target, we examined the effect of disulfide bonding on E2 antigenicity. We show that reduction of three disulfides, as well as deletion of HVR1, improved antibody binding for half of the patient sera tested, whereas it had no effect on the remainder. Small scale immunization of mice with reduced E2 antigens greatly improved serum reactivity with reduced forms of E2 when compared with immunization using native E2, whereas deletion of HVR1 only marginally affected the ability of the serum to bind the redox intermediates. Immunization with reduced E2 also showed an improved neutralizing antibody response, suggesting that potential epitopes are masked on the disulfide-bonded antigen and that mild reduction may increase the breadth of the antibody response. Although E2 function is surprisingly independent of its redox status, its disulfide bonds mask antigenic domains. E2 redox manipulation may contribute to improved vaccine design."

Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar). In vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells, differentiation is characterized by the expression of contractile proteins such as smooth muscle-specific myosin heavy chain. The ligand-induced regulation of the expression of contractile proteins has also been demonstrated to rely on the activation of Ras, Raf, MEK, and ERK1/2 (2Reusch H.P. Schaefer M. Plum C. Schultz G.

However, the signaling intermediates linking GPCRs to Ras activation are poorly defined.Current understanding of GPCR-induced MAP kinase signaling implies either a Ras-independent pathway that is mediated by protein kinase C (PKC) or a Ras-dependent pathway that involves tyrosine phosphorylation. The latter was first shown to rely on nonreceptor tyrosine kinases such as Src and the proline-rich tyrosine kinase Pyk2, but it was later demonstrated to require an extracellular matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-mediated ectodomain shedding of pro-HB-EGF or pro-amphiregulin and subsequent para- or autocrine transactivation of several EGF receptor subtypes (3Higashiyama S.

Schaefer M. Plum C. Schultz G. Paul M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19540-19547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were grown in minimal essential medium and transiently transfected with FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. After 12–24 h, the cells were starved in serum-free medium for another 12 h before the experiments. The transcriptional regulation of SM-1/SM-2 was assessed with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene expressed under the control of the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain promoter as described (19Schauwienold D. Plum C. Helbing T. Voigt P. Bobbert T. Hoffmann D. Paul M. Reusch H.P. Hypertension. 2003; 41: 546-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Nucleofection of VSM Cells—Nucleofection of VSM cells was performed applying the Nucleofector technology (Amaxa). 2 × 106 cells and a total of 10 μg of DNA were diluted in 100 μl of the nucleofection solution (test solution 4837 for rat VSM cells), and program T-28 was applied. Transfected cells were plated immediately after the procedure. For the small interfering RNA nucleofection, VSM cells were treated with a 100 nm Pyk2 siRNA pool (25 nm of each Pyk2 siRNA) or 100 nm Allstars negative control siRNA instead of DNA. After nucleofection, the cells were grown in the presence of 10% serum for 24 h and for an additional 36 h in a serum-free quiescent medium containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma) instead of serum prior to agonist stimulation and cell lysis.Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and Densitometry— For immunoprecipitation analysis, VSM cells were lysed for 5 min on ice in a lysis buffer (0.5% Igepal, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 mm β-glycerolphosphate) and scratched off the plates. Typically 600 μg of protein were incubated with 2 μg of the respective antibody and 5 μg of protein A-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed with lysis buffer and suspended in 100 μl of Laemmli buffer, of which 20 μl were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The blots were probed with respective primary and horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies. For densitometry, signal intensities were detected with a cooled CCD camera (Aida; Raytest). Band intensities were background-corrected and evaluated with TINA 2.09 software (Raytest), and the means ± S.E. were calculated.Fluorometric Analysis of Src Activity in Living Cells—A Src kinase sensor construct (14Gil-Henn H. Destaing O. Sims N.A. Aoki K. Alles N. Neff L. Sanjay A. Bruzzaniti A. De Camilli P. Baron R. Schlessinger J. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 1053-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number AF440202) was constructed by PCR methods and ligated into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). A halide-insensitive and membrane-attached Src indicator (Src sensorCAAX) was generated by replacing the open reading frame of the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein by that of Citrine, a Cl--insensitive variant of YFP, and by replacing the C-terminal residues of Citrine (DELYK) by a C-terminal CAAX motif (DELYNPPDESGPGCMSCKCVLM, predicted palmitoylation and farnesylation sites underlined). The cDNA sequences of all constructs were confirmed by sequencing.The cyan and yellow fluorochromes of Src sensor proteins were imaged with a Xenon light source and a monochromator (Polychrome IV; Till-Photonics) attached to an inverted microscope and a cooled CCD camera (Imago; Till-Photonics). Emitted light was collected using a dual reflectivity beamsplitter (360–440 nm and 500–520 nm; Chroma) and a motorized filter wheel (Lambda 10/2; Sutter Instruments) equipped with band pass filters (460–500 nm for CFP or 535–580 nm for YFP or FRET). CFP and FRET signals were assessed by exciting the probe at 410 nm, and YFP or Citrine were selectively excited at 515 nm. The signals in the FRET channel (λex = 410 nm, λem = 535–580 nm) were corrected for interfering emission of CFP and residual excitation of YFP/Citrine to obtain true FRET signals. FRET signals were normalized to the CFP intensity by a correction factor of 1.58 to compensate for the higher quantum yield of the FRET acceptors and the impact of the selected filter sets on the sensitivity of CFP and FRET detection. FRET efficiencies E were calculated by dividing the corrected FRET intensities (FFRET) by the total donor fluorescence intensity E = FFRET/(FCFP + FFRET). In each experiment, FRET efficiencies of 7–10 single cells located in a visual field were determined and averaged. Basal FRET efficiencies were determined during the last 30 s before stimulation with EGF. The maximal decay of FRET after adding EGF (50 ng/ml) to the bath solution was assessed for a 10-s interval and taken as a measure for Src kinase activity. For each setting, a minimum of five independent transfection experiments was performed, and the means ± S.E. were calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired Student's t test.RESULTSEGF Receptor Transactivation in Response to Thrombin Stimulation—A well accepted EGF receptor transactivation pathway relies on the MMP-dependent cleavage of pro-HB-EGF and subsequent HB-EGF binding to the receptor. We initially tested the role of MMP activation and subsequent HB-EGF-mediated EGF receptor activation for the GPCR-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in neonatal rat VSM cells. Thrombin or the proteinase-activated receptor 1-activating peptide TRAP induced a strong phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which was almost completely blocked by the EGF receptor-specific tyrphostin AG1478 (Fig. 1A). Likewise, preincubation with an EGF receptor-blocking antibody or the MMP inhibitor BB2116 suppressed the agonist-induced ERK phosphorylation to a similar extent as seen in AG1478-pretreated cells (Fig. 1A). Similar data were obtained if released EGF receptor ligands were scavenged by heparin (data not shown). Contrary, the PDGF receptor-specific blocker AG1295 completely suppressed the ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by PDGF-BB but had no effect on the thrombin-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). Analysis of the phosphorylation status of the EGF receptor confirmed the requirement for an MMP-mediated release of an extracellular EGF receptor ligand for the thrombin-induced transactivation of this receptor tyrosine kinase in VSM cells (Fig. 1C).In addition to the extracellular mechanism for EGF receptor transactivation, intracellular signaling pathways involving the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases Pyk2 and Src may also result in an EGF receptor transactivation (8Ginnan R. Singer H.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C754-C761Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or even bypass the RTK to activate MAP kinases (10Blaukat A. Ivankovic-Dikic I. Grönroos E. Dolfi F. Tokiwa G. Vuori K. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14893-14901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Thrombin stimulation induced a robust tyrosine phosphorylation of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases Pyk2 and Src as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and subsequent immunoblot analysis applying anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 1D). In neonatal rat VSM cells, commercially available phospho-peptide-specific Pyk2 and Src antibodies failed to detect specific bands, thereby precluding a more detailed analysis of phosphorylation sites.Because a GPCR-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was prevented by the inhibition of the MMP-mediated release of EGF receptor ligands, the role of the cytoplasmic nonreceptor tyrosine kinases Pyk2 and Src was thus unclear. We therefore attempted to assess the potential contribution of the nonreceptor kinases Pyk2 and Src in the thrombin-induced activation of ERK1/2.Pyk2·Src Are Downstream Effectors of the Transactivated EGF Receptor—Considering that Src can phosphorylate the EGF receptor at Tyr845 in the activation loop of its kinase domain, we assayed the phosphorylation state at this position in thrombin- and EGF-stimulated VSM cells. Prior to agonist application, VSM cells were serum-starved for 36 h and stimulated with thrombin or with EGF for 5 min. Unexpectedly, phosphorylation of the EGF receptor at Tyr845 could be demonstrated after EGF treatment, but not upon thrombin stimulation (Fig. 2A). The inverse correlation of EGF receptor band intensities and Tyr(P)845 signals in EGF-stimulated cells presumably results from a modification of the epitope of the anti-EGF receptor antibody, which recognizes an epitope around the Grb2-binding site at Tyr1068. Moreover, the EGF-induced phosphorylation of Tyr845 was sensitive to AG1478 pretreatment but not to the Src inhibitor PP2. To test whether other tyrosine residues of the EGF receptor may become phosphorylated, we immunoprecipitated the EGF receptor and probed its global tyrosine phosphorylation. Indeed, an increase in the overall tyrosine phosphorylation of the transactivated EGF receptor was detectable and sensitive to AG1478 or PP2 treatment (Fig. 2B). These data imply that the EGF receptor phosphorylation following transactivation nonetheless requires an intact Src activity.FIGURE 2Kinase-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation and differentiation in VSM cells. A–C, serum-starved VSM cells were pretreated with 250 nm AG1478 or 2 μm PP2 and stimulated for 5 min with 2 units/ml thrombin (thr.) or 50 ng/ml EGF for 5 min. A, whole cell lysates were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted, and probed with anti-phospho-EGF receptor (Tyr845) or anti-EGF receptor antibodies. B, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-EGF receptor followed by immunoblotting with a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. C, whole cell lysates were subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis, blotted, and probed with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 and anti-ERK1/2 antibodies. D, VSM cells were nucleofected (Amaxa) with 2 μg of HA-tagged ERK1 and 8 μg of pcDNA3, kd Pyk2, or kd Src expression constructs. The cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies followed by immunoblotting with ERK1/2 antibodies as indicated. Results from all experiments shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. E, VSM cells were cotransfected (Superfect) with 0.5 μg/well pCAT-1352 and the indicated amounts (in μg) of C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) or kd Pyk2 expression constructs (total plasmid amount 1 μg) and stimulated with thrombin as indicated. The bars represent the means and S.E. of at least five independent transfection experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Accordingly, inhibition of either EGF receptor kinase activity by AG1478 or inhibition of Src by PP2 almost completely abolished the thrombin-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). Similar results were obtained with SU6656 (5 μm) instead of PP2 (data not shown). To assess the potential impact of Pyk2 and Src on the thrombin-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in VSM cells, we cotransfected kinase-deficient constructs of Pyk2 or Src along with an HA-tagged ERK1 construct, allowing immunoprecipitation of HA-ERK1 and subsequent analysis of the phosphorylation status in transfected cells. Densitometric analysis revealed an approximately 40–50% reduction of the thrombin-induced ERK1 phosphorylation when kinase-deficient Pyk2 or Src constructs were coexpressed (n = 4; Fig. 2D). This partial but significant inhibition of the thrombin-induced phosphorylation of HA-ERK1 as opposed to the almost complete inhibition by PP2 may be due to the fact that PP2 induces additional inhibition of other kinases such as the EGF receptor and/or MEK or that the expression level of kd Src was not sufficiently high to suppress endogenous Src kinase activity.Additionally, to elucidate the contribution of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases Pyk2 and Src to the thrombin-induced VSM cell differentiation, the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, expressed under the control of the smooth muscle-specific myosin heavy chain promoter, was utilized. Coexpression of increasing amounts of the Src-inactivating C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) or of a kinase-deficient Pyk2 construct suppressed the thrombin-induced reporter gene activity in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 2E). These data indicate that the EGF receptor, as well as Pyk2 and Src, are involved in the thrombin-induced activation of MAP kinases and subsequent regulation of contractile gene expression. However, the signaling cascade of either sequential or parallel activation of both pathways was still unclear.If the Pyk2·Src signaling module is located upstream or parallel to the EGF receptor transactivation, one would expect that modulators of the TMS pathway do not interfere with the GPCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 and Src. However, we found that blocking the TMS pathway not only prevented the thrombin-induced EGF receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 1C) but also disrupted the thrombin-stimulated phosphorylation of Pyk2 and Src (Fig. 3). These findings clearly indicate that, in VSM cells, phosphorylation of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases occurs downstream of the transactivated EGF receptor.FIGURE 3MMP activity and HB-EGF shedding are required to phosphorylate Pyk2 and Src. VSM cells were pretreated with AG1478, heparin or BB2116 and stimulated with thrombin. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-Pyk2 (A) or anti-Src antibodies (B) followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-Pyk2, or anti-Src antibodies as indicated. Results from all experiments shown are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Transactivated EGF Receptor Recruits Pyk2 and Src— Because Src can interact with the EGF receptor and because activated Pyk2 complexes with Src, we asked whether Pyk2 may be recruited to the transactivated EGF receptor. To this end, we immunoprecipitated the EGF receptor from thrombin-treated VSM cells and probed the precipitates for copurified Pyk2. As shown in Fig. 4A, thrombin stimulation led to an increase in the amount of EGF receptor-bound Pyk2, which was reverted in the presence of AG1478. Similar results were obtained when Pyk2 was immunoprecipitated, and the copurified EGF receptor content was determined (Fig. 4A). We therefore conclude that the transactivated EGF receptor is capable of recruiting Pyk2. To further assess whether under these conditions Pyk2 also complexes with Src, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were conducted with Src and Pyk2 antibodies. The results clearly indicate that EGF receptor activity is required for the physical association between Pyk2 and Src (Fig. 4B), thus locating the interaction of these kinases downstream of the transactivated RTK. Interestingly, Pyk2 interaction with both EGF receptor and Src was Ca2+-dependent because clamping of the [Ca2+]i in BAPTA-AM-loaded VSM cells or prevention of Ca2+ influx by adding EGTA to the extracellular medium blocked the thrombin-induced interaction between the kinases (Fig. 4C). In the presence of KN-93, a blocker of calmodulin-dependent kinases, association of Pyk2 with Src or with the EGF receptor was partially inhibited.FIGURE 4Pyk2 and Src cluster at the EGF receptor upon thrombin stimulation. A and B, VSM cells were pretreated with AG1478 and stimulated with thrombin. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-EGF receptor, anti-Pyk2 or anti-Src antibodies as indicated, and the respective copurified kinases were detected by immunoblot analysis. Results from all experiments shown are representative of three independent experiments. C, VSM cells were pretreated for 30 min with 10 μm BAPTA-AM, 3 mm EGTA, or 30 μm KN-93, and stimulated for 5 min with thrombin as indicated. The cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-Pyk2 antibody. Copurified EGF receptor and Src were detected by immunoblot analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Role of [Ca2+]i and CaM Kinase II—Activation of Pyk2 can be triggered by elevations of the [Ca2+]i or by PKC activation. However, the exact mechanisms leading to Pyk2 phosphorylation are still unresolved. To assess the role of thrombin-induced [Ca2+]i signals for the phosphorylation of Pyk2 and the EGF receptor, we tested the effect of an intracellularly loaded Ca2+ chelator (BAPTA-AM) on the tyrosine phosphorylation of the respective kinases. Consistent with previous findings in other cell lines, the thrombin-induced Pyk2 phosphorylation was abolished in BAPTA-AM-treated VSM cells (Fig. 5A). A similar Ca2+ dependence was evident for the thrombin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (Fig. 5B). In addition KN-93, an inhibitor of CaM kinase II, also inhibited the thrombin-induced phosphorylation of Pyk2 and the EGF receptor.FIGURE 5Ca2+-requirement for the activation of the EGF receptor and Pyk2. A and B, VSM cells were pretreated for 30 min with 10 μm BAPTA-AM or 30 μm KN-93 and stimulated with thrombin.

https://openalex.org/W2157896281,"Background Gene order in eukaryotic chromosomes is not random and has been linked to coordination of gene expression, chromatin structure and also recombination rate. The evolution of recombination rate is especially relevant for genes involved in immunity because host-parasite co-evolution could select for increased recombination rate (Red Queen hypothesis). To identify patterns left by the intimate interaction between hosts and parasites, I analysed the genomic parameters of the immune genes from 24 gene families/groups of Drosophila melanogaster. Principal Findings Immune genes that directly interact with the pathogen (i.e. recognition and effector genes) clustered in regions of higher recombination rates. Out of these, clustered effector genes were transcribed fastest indicating that transcriptional control might be one major cause for cluster formation. The relative position of clusters to each other, on the other hand, cannot be explained by transcriptional control per se. Drosophila immune genes that show epistatic interactions can be found at an average distance of 15.44±2.98 cM, which is considerably closer than genes that do not interact (30.64±1.95 cM). Conclusions Epistatically interacting genes rarely belong to the same cluster, which supports recent models of optimal recombination rates between interacting genes in antagonistic host-parasite co-evolution. These patterns suggest that formation of local clusters might be a result of transcriptional control, but that in the condensed genome of D. melanogaster relative position of these clusters may be a result of selection for optimal rather than maximal recombination rates between these clusters."
https://openalex.org/W2010060262,"OTT/RBM15-BSAC/MAL/MKL1/MRTF-A was identified as a fusion transcript generated by t(1;22)(p13;q13) in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Previous studies have shown that BSAC (basic, SAP, and coiled-coil domain) activates the promoters containing CArG boxes via interaction with serum response factor, and OTT (one twenty-two) negatively regulates the development of megakaryocytes and myeloid cells. However, the mechanism by which OTT-BSAC promotes leukemia is largely unknown. Here we show that OTT-BSAC, but not BSAC or OTT strongly activates several promoters containing a transcription factor Yin Yang 1-binding sequence. In addition, although BSAC predominantly localizes in the cytoplasm and its nuclear translocation is considered to be regulated by the Rho-actin signaling pathway, OTT-BSAC exclusively localizes in the nucleus. Moreover, OTT interacts with histone deacetylase 3, but this interaction is abolished in OTT-BSAC. Collectively, these functional and spatial changes of OTT and BSAC caused by the fusion might perturb their functions, culminating in the development of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia."
