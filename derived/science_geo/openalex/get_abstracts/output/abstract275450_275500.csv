https://openalex.org/W2136392205,"An increasing body of research indicates that carbon can exist in a number of polymorphic ""carbyne"" forms. It is proposed that these forms occur because of a shift to triple bonding in the carbon system as temperature increases above 2600 K. It is also proposed that graphite can dissociate into triple-bonded molecules by a simple mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2011917961,Radiation from electrical power lines leaks into the magnetosphere and stimulates strong very-low-frequency wave activity out to many earth radii. Observations in Antarctica show that wave activity induced by power lines tends to occur during the daytime when power consumption is high in the source region in eastern Canada. The wave frequency ranges from 1 to 8 kilohertz. This man-made wave activity may have significant effects on energetic electrons trapped in the earth's radiation belts.
https://openalex.org/W2039669605,Strong photoinduced nucleation of pure water vapor was found to occur in a wavelength range where no ultraviolet absorption of water vapor has been reported. Systematic studies were made of the dependence of the nucleation rate and the delay time for the initiation of nucleation on light intensity. The results obtained were accurately fitted by a phenomenological mechanism whereby the nucleation is initiated by clusters accumulating an appropriate number of photoexcited water molecules.

The same stars and constellations are used by modern eastern Cushitic peoples to calculate an accurate calendar. The fact that Namoratunga dates to about 300 B.C. suggests that a prehistoric calendar based on detailed astronomical knowledge was in use in eastern Africa."
https://openalex.org/W1996001470,"Nearly quantitative conversion of nitric oxide (NO) into N(2)H(4)CO has been obtained in the reduction of NO with carbon monoxide and hydrogen over platinum and rhodium catalysts. Depending on the temperature of collection, N(2)H(4)CO is isolated as ammonium cyanate or its isomer, urea. The process is an effective way of recovering fixed nitrogen from dilute industrial streams containing NO. Ammonium cyanate may play a role in the reduction of NO in automotive exhaust control."
https://openalex.org/W2009314368,"An abundant, previously problematic fossil from the Lower Ordovician (Canadian) Black Rock limestone of the Ozark Uplift area is an undescribed dianulitid bryozoan. It is believed to be the oldest unquestionable bryozoan known. The growth morphology varies widely and is believed to be environmentally influenced."

https://openalex.org/W2033927204,The formation of hydrogen cyanide during the catalytic reduction of nitric oxide (NO) with carbon monoxide and hydrogen was studied with a bench-scale flow reactor. The previously reported inhibition by sulfur dioxide of the formation of hydrogen cyanide was found to be counteracted by transient admission of oxygen to the catalyst. These results are discussed in the context of the control of automotive emissions of NO and the prevention of hydrogen cyanide production during such control.
https://openalex.org/W1595162522,"Angered and emboldened by the Wen Ho Lee case, many Asian-American researchers at national laboratories are decrying their status as ""high-tech coolies""--and demanding change. It's a sudden and surprising turn of events for a community that traditionally has avoided political organization, legal recourse, and conflict with authority. And given the growing numerical muscle of Asian Americans in both public and private labs, the budding movement--if sustained--will be felt far beyond the secure fences of the Department of Energy's weapons labs."
https://openalex.org/W1976461702,"South America has hydropower potential exceeding 300 gigaw, of which Vertical Bar3; 10Vertical Bar3< is now in use. In Brazil alone, the estimated untapped potential is 150 gigaw at large dam sites only. The controversy and problems that have plagued the nuclear industry in the U.S. and Europe are developing in Latin America too. Nearly 30%Vertical Bar3< of Brazil's energy comes from the burning of wood and sugarcane bagasse and similar noncommercial energy sources also play a large role in other Latin American countries. In regard to energy conservation, there has been little attention to the potential for improving the efficiency of energy use, especially in transportation and industry. Venezuela has huge deposits of petroleum in the form of heavy oils and tar sands. Brazil has oil shale deposits second only to those of the U.S. Solar and wind energy will probably be able to make substantial contributions, but the magnitude of the resources is only partially known in most Latin American countries."

https://openalex.org/W2000061966,"A new phase of sulfur is formed from S(4)N(4) held at pressure-temperature conditions in the vicinity of the boundary representing the decomposition of S(4)N(4) to fibrous sulfur, S(x). The new phase is gray-black, is persistently metastable at room conditions, and is insoluble in carbon disulfide. The phase is apparently formed from a stage of decomposition during which high-conductance transients are observed in in situ electrical experiments. The sulfur phase appears to form upon the release of the nitrogen from a sulfur-nitrogen chain that is produced from the scission of an S(4)N(4) ring."

Now Hu struggles to keep up with his Massachusetts Institute of Technology classes in computer science and electrical engineering in his new life as an activist."

https://openalex.org/W1499550833,"The National Labor Relations Board last week gave a nod to the first graduate students' union at a private university. The board's ruling that graduate teaching and research assistants at New York University qualify as ""employees"" potentially puts them on equal footing with colleagues at publicly funded campuses in more than 20 states. University administrators deplored the ruling, which thrilled labor organizers."
https://openalex.org/W1541832193,"Until the past year, Alex Chao, a senior physicist at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, tended to keep his views to himself. But the Wen Ho Lee case turned Chao into a reluctant activist who has contributed money for Lee's defense, helped organize rallies in the San Francisco Bay area, and talked to his neighbors about the injustice he believes Lee and other Asian Americans have suffered."

A dozen years later, Ronald Chuang still has no permanent position, and he and his wife filed suit in 1997 over what they allege is a long and egregious series of discriminatory acts by the university."
