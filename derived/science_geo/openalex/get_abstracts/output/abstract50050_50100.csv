https://openalex.org/W2045493030,"Two experiments were designed to examine the effects of attentional demands on the electroencephalogram during cognitive and emotional tasks. We found an interaction of task with hemisphere as well as more overall parietal alpha for tasks not requiring attention to the environment, such as mental arithmetic, than for those requiring such attention. Differential hemispheric activation for beta was found most strongly in the temporal areas for emotionally positive or negative tasks and in the parietal areas for cognitive tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2080781505,"Cerebral cortex samples from patients with Alzheimer's disease and from rats after experimental cholinergic denervation of the cerebral cortex exhibited reductions in the presynaptic marker choline acetyltransferase activity and in the number of M2 muscarine receptors, with no change in the number of M1 receptors. These results are in keeping with evidence that M2 receptors function in cholinergic nerve terminals to regulate the release of acetylcholine, whereas M1 receptors are located on postsynaptic cells and facilitate cellular excitation. New M1-selective agonists and M2-selective antagonists directed at post- or presynaptic sites deserve consideration as potential agents for the treatment of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2086462010,"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG CoA reductase) is a single polypeptide chain with two contiguous domains: a soluble domain (548 amino acids) that catalyzes the rate-controlling step in cholesterol synthesis and a membrane-bound domain (339 amino acids) that anchors the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). HMG CoA reductase is degraded at least 10-fold more rapidly than other ER proteins; degradation is accelerated in the presence of cholesterol. To understand this controlled degradation, we transfected reductase-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with a plasmid expression vector containing a reductase cDNA that lacks the segment encoding the membrane domain. The plasmid produced a truncated reductase (37 kd smaller than normal) that was enzymatically active with normal kinetics; most of the truncated enzyme was found in the cytosol. The truncated enzyme was degraded one-fifth as fast as the holoenzyme; degradation was no longer accelerated by sterols. We conclude that the membrane-bound domain of reductase plays a crucial role in the rapid and regulated degradation of this ER protein."
https://openalex.org/W2002716861,The fatty acid composition of the cell membrane of the barophilic marine bacterium CNPT3 was found to vary as a function of pressure. Greater amounts of unsaturated fatty acids were present in bacteria growing at higher pressures. The results suggest adaptations in the membrane lipids to environmentally relevant pressures. This response to pressure appears to be analogous to temperature-induced membrane adaptations observed in other organisms.
https://openalex.org/W1512762418,"Two novel phospholipase activities have been identified in the cytosolic fraction of canine myocardium. Neutral active phospholipase C activity was partially purified by anion exchange, hydroxylapatite, chromatofocusing, and gel filtration chromatographies. The partially purified enzyme had similar maximum velocities (237 versus 241 nmol/mg X h) and apparent Michaelis constants (20 versus 14 microM) utilizing either plasmenylcholine or phosphatidylcholine as substrate. Myocardial phospholipase C had a pH optimum between 7 and 8, required divalent cations for maximal activity, and did not hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol or sphingomyelin. Myocardial cytosol contained a potent inhibitor of phospholipase C which masked enzymic activity until it was removed during the purification procedure. A plasmalogen selective phospholipase A2 activity was also identified in the cytosolic fraction of canine myocardium. The protein catalyzing this activity was partially purified by DEAE-Sephacel-hydroxylapatite tandem chromatography and exhibited a maximum velocity of 5 nmol/mg X h for plasmenylcholine but only 1 nmol/mg X h for phosphatidylcholine, had a pH optimum between 6 and 7 for both substrates, and did not require calcium ion for activity. These results constitute the first demonstration of a neutral active phospholipase C specific for choline and ethanolamine glycerophospholipids and a plasmalogen selective phospholipase A2 in mammalian tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1486021067,"The present paper describes chemical and functional properties of protease nexin, a serine protease inhibitor released from cultured human fibroblasts. It is shown that protease nexin is actually synthesized by fibroblasts and represents about 1% of their secreted protein. Analysis of the amino acid composition of purified protease nexin indicates that it is evolutionarily related to antithrombin III and heparin cofactor II. Protease nexin contains approximately 6% carbohydrate, with 2.3% amino sugar, 1.1% neutral sugar, and 3.0% sialic acid. The Mr calculated from equilibrium sedimentation analysis is 43,000. Protease nexin is a broad specificity inhibitor of trypsin-like serine proteases. It reacts rapidly with trypsin (kassoc = 4.2 +/- 0.4 X 10(6) M-1 s-1), thrombin (kassoc = 6.0 +/- 1.3 X 10(5) M-1 s-1), urokinase (kassoc = 1.5 +/- 0.1 X 10(5) M-1 s-1), and plasmin (kassoc = 1.3 +/- 0.1 X 10(5) M-1 s-1), and slowly inhibits Factor Xa and the gamma subunit of nerve growth factor but does not inhibit chymotrypsin-like proteases or leukocyte elastase. In the presence of heparin, protease nexin inhibits thrombin at a nearly diffusion-controlled rate. Two heparin affinity classes of protease nexin can be detected. The present characterization pertains to the fraction of protease nexin having the higher affinity for heparin. The low affinity material, which is the minor fraction, is lost during purification."
https://openalex.org/W2159153637,"Energy utilization by the flagellum of motile sea urchin sperm is tightly coupled to the rate of energy production by the mitochondrion. This tight coupling depends upon the transport of high energy phosphate (P) from mitochondrion to axoneme, which we propose to be mediated by a phosphorylcreatine shuttle. The shuttle employs distinct mitochondrial and axonemal creatine kinase isozymes, the latter being a novel creatine kinase of 145 kd. To examine whether P is directed to the tail by such a shuttle, we inactivated creatine kinase specifically with fluorodinitrobenzene. Creatine kinase inactivation led to an inhibition of coupled, but not uncoupled, respiration and affected the pattern of sperm motility as predicted for the disruption of an obligatory link in P transport."
https://openalex.org/W2013661745,"Changes in protein composition of the nuclear lamina were monitored during early development in Xenopus. Lamin LIII, the only lamin present in oocyte nuclei, serves as a lamin pool for the formation of pronuclei and early cleavage nuclei. It is present in embryos up to the tail bud stages. Lamins LI and LII, the lamins originally found in adult cell nuclei, appear at characteristic times in development. LI first appears at the midblastula transition (MBT), and LII at the gastrula. Tryptic peptide analysis revealed that all three lamin forms found in the embryo are identical with the adult lamins. De novo synthesis of LIII and LI, observed at MBT, is independent of transcription and must therefore be due to activation of maternal mRNAs. These results are discussed in relation to other nuclear changes occurring during early development."
https://openalex.org/W1518576018,"Abstract We have previously shown that inositol trisphosphate (IP3) releases Ca2+ from a nonmitochondrial pool of permeabilized rat pancreatic acinar cells (Streb, H., Irvine, R. F., Berridge, M. J., and Schulz, I. (1984) Nature 306, 67-69). This pool was later identified as endoplasmic reticulum (Streb, H., Bayerdorffer, E., Haase, W., Irvine, R. F., and Schulz, I. (1984) J. Membr. Biol. 81, 241-253). As IP3 is produced by hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate on activation of many Ca2+-mobilizing receptors, our observation supported the proposal that IP3 functions as a second messenger to release Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum. We have here used the same preparation of permeabilized acinar cells to study the relationship of secretagogue-induced Ca2+ release and IP3 production. We show that: 1) secretagogue-induced Ca2+ release in permeabilized cells is accompanied by a parallel production of inositol trisphosphate. 2) When the secretagogue-induced increase in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration was abolished by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid buffering, secretagogue-induced IP3 production was unimpaired. 3) When secretagogue-induced IP3 production was reduced by inhibiting phospholipase C with neomycin, secretagogue-induced Ca2+ release was also abolished. 4) When the IP3 breakdown was reduced either by lowering the free Mg2+ concentration of the incubation medium or by adding 2.3-diphosphoglyceric acid, the rise in IP3 and the release of Ca2+ induced by secretagogues were both increased. These results further support the role of IP3 as a second messenger to induce Ca2+ mobilization."
https://openalex.org/W1482693857,"Manoalide, an unusual nonsteroidal sesterterpenoid recently isolated from sponge, antagonizes phorbol-induced inflammation but not that induced by arachidonic acid, suggesting that manoalide acts prior to the cyclooxygenase step in prostaglandin synthesis, possibly by inhibiting phospholipase A2. We have now studied the inhibitory effect of manoalide on a homogeneous preparation of phospholipase A2 from cobra venom. For a given concentration of manoalide, the inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity toward dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/Triton X-100 mixed micelles is time-dependent and plateaus at about 85% inhibition of the initial velocity even after extensive preincubation. Metal ions (Ca2+, Ba2+, Mn2+) increase the inhibition, while lysophosphatidylcholine and substrate micelles protect. Increasing manoalide concentration shows increasing inhibition of the initial velocity until a plateau is reached, giving a typical saturation curve with a linear double-reciprocal plot. Under typical conditions (20-min preincubation, 40 degrees C, pH 7.1), 50% inhibition is achieved at a manoalide concentration of about 2 X 10(-6) M. The data indicate that manoalide is a potent inhibitor of the cobra venom phospholipase A2. Manoalide is now shown to react irreversibly with lysine residues in the enzyme. Surprisingly, the cobra venom phospholipase normally acts poorly on phosphatidylethanolamine as substrate, but after reaction with manoalide, the enzyme is somewhat more active toward this substrate rather than being inhibited. This suggests that a lysine residue may be important in understanding the substrate specificity of phospholipase A2."
https://openalex.org/W1520110642,"The interactions of Sepharose 4B-immobilized concanavalin A (ConA) with 10 glycoasparagines derived from ovalbumin were investigated quantitatively by frontal affinity chromatography. In this method, a carbohydrate solution is applied continuously to a ConA-Sepharose column and the retardation of the elution front is measured as a parameter of the strength of the interaction. The dissociation constant (Kd) for each saccharide with ConA can be determined. An analysis of the binding of p-nitrophenyl-alpha,D-mannoside has shown that the binding properties of ConA do not change essentially after immobilization on Sepharose 4B. Each of the ovalbumin glycoasparagines was labeled with tritium by the reductive methylation method for analysis. A comparison of the Kd values obtained showed that the binding of ConA varies considerably with very slight structural differences of the glycosyl chain. The results suggest that ConA recognizes a specific glycosyl chain structure, Man alpha 1-6(Man alpha 1-3)Man, in which at least one hydroxyl group at the C-3 position of C-6-linked mannose should be free. The glycoasparagines containing this structure bound strongly to ConA-Sepharose with dissociation constants below 3.4 X 10(-7) M."
https://openalex.org/W1551428274,"The bovine and chick vitamin D-induced intestinal calcium-binding proteins (CaBP) bind lead. Bovine CaBP binds 2 atoms of lead/molecule, and chick CaBP binds 4 atoms of lead per molecule and these values are identical to those for calcium binding. 45Calcium-displacement studies indicate significantly higher affinities for lead than for calcium for both proteins. All evidence indicates that lead is bound to the 4 high affinity calcium-binding sites on chick CaBP and to the corresponding 2 high affinity sites on bovine CaBP, and that binding of lead to sulfhydryl groups is, relatively, not significant. Calmodulin, troponin C, and oncomodulin also bind lead with high affinities and in preference to calcium, indicating that lead binding is a general property of proteins belonging to the troponin C superfamily of calcium-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1504836130,"Intracellular oxygen pressure within intact isolated cardiac myocytes is studied as a function of steady state extracellular oxygen pressure. The fractional saturation of myoglobin with oxygen is used to report sarcoplasmic oxygen pressure. The fractional oxidation of cytochrome oxidase, the fractional oxidation of cytochrome c, the rate of respiratory oxygen uptake, and lactate accumulation are used to reflect the availability of oxygen at the inner mitochondrial membrane. These probes of mitochondrial function show no large change with decreasing extracellular oxygen pressure until that pressure is less than 2 torr and intracellular myoglobin is largely deoxygenated. Sarcoplasmic oxygen pressure in resting cells is nearly the same as extracellular oxygen pressure and is about 2 torr less in cells whose respiration has been increased 3.5-fold by mitochondrial uncoupling. Oxygen pressure at the mitochondrial inner membrane differs from sarcoplasmic oxygen pressure by no more than 0.2 torr and from extracellular oxygen pressure by no more than 2 torr. We conclude that differences of oxygen pressure within the cardiac myocyte are very small. This implies that most of the large, about 20 torr, difference in oxygen pressure between capillary lumen and mitochondria of the working heart must be extracellular. We conclude also that mitochondria of the cardiac myocyte become oxygen limited only when sarcoplasmic myoglobin is almost entirely deoxygenated."
https://openalex.org/W1584630693,"Sialidase has been purified from rat liver cytosol 83,000-fold by sequential chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, CM-cellulose, Blue-Sepharose, Sephadex G-200, and heparin-Sepharose. When subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis, the purified cytosolic sialidase moved as a single protein band with Mr = 43,000, a value similar to that obtained by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The purified enzyme was active toward all of the sialooligosaccharides, sialoglycoproteins, and gangliosides tested except for submaxillary mucins and GM1 and GM2 gangliosides. Those substrates possessing alpha 2----3 sialyl linkage were hydrolyzed much faster than those with alpha 2----6 or alpha 2----8 linkage. The optimum pH was 6.5 for sialyllactose and 6.0 for orosomucoid and mixed brain gangliosides. The activity toward sialyllactose was lost progressively with the progress of purification but restored by addition of proteins such as bovine serum albumin. In contrast, neither reduction by purification nor restoration by albumin was observed for the activity toward orosomucoid. When mixed gangliosides were the substrate, bile acids were required for activity and this requirement became almost absolute after the enzyme had been purified extensively. Intracellular distribution study showed that about 15% of the neutral sialidase activity was in the microsomes. The enzyme could be released by 0.5 M NaCl; the released enzyme was indistinguishable from the cytosolic sialidase in properties."
https://openalex.org/W1597303621,"Eight overlapping phage clones, spanning 34.4 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA, containing the 7.2-kilobase pair rat beta-casein gene have been isolated and characterized. The first 510 base pairs (bp) of 5' flanking, 110 bp of 3' flanking, and all the exon/intron junctions have been sequenced. The beta-casein gene contains 9 exons ranging in size from 21 to 525 bp. We have attempted to identify potential regulatory elements by searching for regions of sequence homology shared between milk protein genes which respond similarly to lactogenic hormones and by searching for previously reported hormone receptor-binding sites. Within the conserved first 200 bp of 5' flanking sequences 3 regions of greater than 70% homology were observed between the rat beta- and gamma-casein genes. One of these contains a region 90% homologous to the chicken progesterone receptor-binding site. The conserved 5' noncoding region, the highly conserved signal peptide, and the hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal region of the protein are each encoded by a separate exon. In contrast the evolutionarily conserved phosphorylation site of beta-casein is formed by an RNA-splicing event. The exons which encode the phosphorylation sites of beta-casein appear to have resulted from an intragenic duplication. Based upon the exon structure of the casein genes, an evolutionary model of intragenic and intergenic exon duplications for this gene family is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1490409029,"Abstract Lactosaminoglycan glycopeptides were isolated from human PA1 embryonal carcinoma cells and their structures were elucidated. The glycopeptides were digested by Escherichia freundii endo-beta-galactosidase before and after the modifications by exoglycosidases. The core glycopeptides and oligosaccharides thus obtained and the intact glycopeptides were analyzed by methylation, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, and high-performance liquid chromatography. Based on these experiments, the structures of PA1 lactosaminoglycans were found to have the following unique features. 1) Three lactosaminoglycan fractions of different molecular weights were isolated by Sephadex G-50 gel filtration. Lactosaminoglycans of the highest molecular weight (GpI) have tetra-antennary cores, those of intermediate molecular weight (GpII) have triantennary cores and those of low molecular weight (GpIII) have triantennary and tetra-antennary cores. 2) GpI is composed of 22-26 lactosaminyl units and 7-9 branched galactose residues, GpII is composed of 16-22 lactosaminyl units and 5-7 branched galactose residues, and GpIII is composed of 12-16 lactosaminyl units and 3-4 branched galactose residues. 3) Each branch is short and is composed of the Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----6 structure. 4) Sialic acid is preferentially linked to nonreducing terminal regions and a significant amount of the novel disialosyl structure, NeuNAc alpha 2----9NeuNAc alpha 2----3/6Gal, is present at the terminals of the longer polylactosaminyl side chains. 5) These lactosaminoglycans are carried by cell surface glycoproteins of Mr = 80,000 approximately 120,000, as evidenced by lectin-agarose chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1527740705,"Glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase activities were associated with a particulate fraction in a cardiac homogenate preparation. NaCl treatment displaced these activities from the particulate fraction. These membrane-associated glycolytic enzymes were gradually lost during the rigorous isolation procedures needed to purify sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticular vesicles. However, exogenously added enzymes did bind to these purified membranes in relatively large quantities (glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase: 1.14 mg of enzyme/mg of sarcolemma, 0.30 mg of enzyme/mg of sarcoplasmic reticulum; phosphoglycerate kinase: 1.02 mg of enzyme/mg of sarcolemma, 0.12 mg of enzyme/mg of sarcoplasmic reticulum), which suggests a nonspecific type of binding interaction. Approximately 50% of the glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase and 90% of the phosphoglycerate kinase were inactivated upon binding. NaCl removed the enzyme from the membranes in a concentration-dependent manner similar to its effects in the particulate fraction. Dimethonium (5 mM), an organic divalent cation which screens membrane-surface charge, removed greater than 90% glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase from the sarcolemmal membrane. These results, and those with NaCl, suggest that the binding of the enzyme to the membrane is charge-related. Phospholipids extracted from the sarcolemmal membrane were capable of binding and inactivating both glycolytic enzymes. Purified anionic phospholipids were more potent at binding and inactivating both enzymes than were neutral phospholipids. These data show that glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase can bind to sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticular membranes. This binding is reversible, charge-dependent, and inhibitory. This binding is likely to involve anionic membrane phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W1532880215,"The ion-transport properties of the basal lateral membranes of intact isolated parietal cells were studied at the cellular and subcellular level. The presence of an amiloride-sensitive Na+:H+ exchange was demonstrated in cells by proton gradient-driven Na+ uptake and by changes in cell pH as monitored by dimethylcarboxylfluorescein fluorescence both in a fluorimeter and on single isolated cells using a fluorescence microscope and an attached intensified photodiode array spectrophotometer. The presence of the Na+:H+ antiport in vesicles was shown both by intravesicular acidification monitored by acridine orange fluorescent quenching and by proton gradient-dependent Na+ uptake. The presence of Cl-:HCO-3 exchange was determined in intact cells by monitoring changes in cell pH due to Cl- uptake and was shown to be 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid- and 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid-sensitive. In vesicles, Cl-:HCO-3 exchange was demonstrated by Cl- flux measurement. The apparent affinities for both Cl- and HCO-3 on either side of the membrane were determined to be Km Cli = 20 mM, Km Clout = 17.5 mM, Km HCO-3in = 2.5 mM, and Km HCO-3out = 7.5 mM. A K+ conductance in cells and vesicles was demonstrated by monitoring K+ gradient-dependent 86Rb uptake. No evidence was found for the presence of a Cl- conductance in either cells or vesicles but a H+ conductance was found to be present in vesicles but not in intact cells. In the latter, by determining the effect of either Na+ or Cl- gradients on cell pH and by flux calculations it was concluded that the Cl-:HCO-3 exchange was the major passive flux mechanism for pH regulation in this cell type."
https://openalex.org/W1648389938,"The in vivo cross-linking of proteins to DNA in intact Novikoff ascites hepatoma cells exposed to the chromium salt K2CrO4 was studied. DNA-protein complexes were assayed by high speed centrifugation of cells solubilized in buffered 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate and by electrophoretic identification of proteins associated with DNA-containing pellets. Further evidence of DNA-protein complexes, not dissociable in this buffer, was obtained by CsCl gradient centrifugation. Time dependence experiments showed that detectable cross-linking occurred after cells were exposed to chromium salt for at least 4 h, and the amount of DNA-protein complexes increased with longer incubation times. Complex formation occurred only with chromium salt concentrations of 200 microM or greater, and maximal cross-linking was effected at 5 mM. Immunotransfer methodology employing antibodies to nuclear matrix fraction and lamins was used to identify some of the polypeptides comprising the cross-linked complexes. These studies indicated specificity of chromium-induced complex formation within the nuclear protein fractions assayed. Our results document the ability of chromate to produce specific DNA-protein cross-links in living cells."
https://openalex.org/W1530231515,"A new cytochrome P-450 isozyme (RLM2) has been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from liver microsomes of the untreated rat. It has an apparent minimum molecular weight on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 49,000. Absolute spectrum of the oxidized form indicates that this isozyme is essentially all in the low spin state. The maximum of the reduced CO complex is at 449 nm. Amino-terminal partial amino acid sequence and amino acid composition are different from those of RLM3 and RLM5, two other native forms of cytochrome P-450 previously reported from this laboratory as well as other forms reported in the literature. RLM2 is capable of oxidizing a variety of drug substrates, like benzphetamine and aminopyrine, and to a lesser extent ethoxycoumarin. With the steroid substrate multiple isomeric products are formed differentially. Progesterone is preferentially hydroxylated at the 15-position (15 beta-hydroxylation (34%) and 15 alpha-hydroxylation (13%) of the total) and at the 6 beta-position (21%). The major metabolite when testosterone was the substrate, 15 alpha-hydroxytestosterone, comprised 43% of the total, while a modest amount of 6 beta-hydroxytestosterone (12%) is formed. Another major metabolite (31%) has yet to be unequivocally identified, but is suggested to be 7 beta-hydroxytestosterone. Examination of the substrate dependence of major and minor isomeric metabolites provides evidence for a single substrate-binding site on RLM2. Regardless of the position hydroxylated, a common Km value was obtained. It is suggested that differences in formation of the isomeric and epimeric products relate to differences in distance from the active oxygen center and the position of attack."
https://openalex.org/W1592018399,"A pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent histidine decarboxylase from Morganella morganii AM-15 was purified to homogeneity. The enzyme is a tetramer (Mr 170,000) of identical subunits and binds 4 pyridoxal-P/tetramer; it is resolved by dialysis against cysteine at pH 6.8. Between pH 6.2 and 8.8, the holoenzyme shows pH-independent absorbance maxima at 333 and 416 nm. Vmax/Km is highest at pH 6.5; this optimum reflects chiefly increased Km values for histidine at lower or higher pH values, whereas Vmax is highest at pH 5.0 and decreases only moderately between pH 5.0 and 8.0. The enzyme also decarboxylates beta-(2-pyridyl)alanine and N tau-methylhistidine (but not N pi-methylhistidine); arginine, lysine, and ornithine are neither substrates nor inhibitors. The hydrazine analogue of histidine, 2-hydrazino-3-(4-imidazolyl)propionic acid, is a very potent competitive inhibitor; other carbonyl reagents and a variety of carboxyl- or amino-substituted histidines also inhibit competitively. alpha-Fluoromethylhistidine is a potent irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme; alpha-methylhistidine is a competitive inhibitor/substrate that is decarboxylated slowly and undergoes a slow decarboxylation-dependent transamination that converts the holoenzyme to pyridoxamine-P and apoenzyme. Dithiothreitol and other simple thiols are mixed-type inhibitors that interact with pyridoxal-P at the active site to form complexes (lambda max congruent to 340 nm), presumably the corresponding thioalkylamines, without resolving the holoenzyme. This histidine decarboxylase (Vmax = 72 mumol X min-1 X mg-1) is much more active than homogeneous preparations of mammalian pyridoxal-P-dependent histidine decarboxylase (Vmax congruent to 1.0) and is about equal in activity to the pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylases from Gram-positive bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2138141608,"A protein of subunit Mr 34,000 (corrected here and subsequently to 36,000) has been isolated from a muscle homogenate which catalyzes the formation of the triad junction from isolated transverse tubules and terminal cisternae. This protein is identified as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase on the basis of N-terminal amino acid sequence, amino acid composition, and enzymic activity. The oxidation of glyceraldehyde phosphate by the enzyme is slowly but progressively inhibited by terminal cisternae, longitudinal reticulum, and transverse tubules. Addition of Triton X-100 to terminal cisternae markedly enhances and accelerates the inhibition. Two distinct constituents of microsomes exhibit a progressive inhibition. One component has been fractionated on a hydroxyapatite column and was identified as calsequestrin. Calsequestrin reveals an immediate inhibition of glyceraldehyde phosphate oxidation which can be reversed by concentrations of CaCl2 below millimolar levels or by high ionic strength. Isolated terminal cisternae contain glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase which can be extracted by high ionic strength."

https://openalex.org/W1973444197,"The complement cleavage product C5a is a potent stimulant of inflammatory processes; thus, inhibition of C5a activity is of therapeutic interest. The three-dimensional structure of the major portion of C5a was modeled from the homologous C3a crystal structure by comparative modeling techniques. The model shows that core residues of C5a are completely conserved, while external residues differ from C3a. Even though the amino-terminal 12 residues of C3a are disordered in the crystal, this sequence in C5a may form an amphipathic helix. The distribution of species sequence differences in the complete C5a structure suggests a possible receptor binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1569756663,"The peptide C5a is thought to play an important role in the inflammatory response primarily through its action on the polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN). The receptor for C5a on human PMN has now been identified by affinity labeling. Cross-linking 125I-C5a to intact PMN with disuccinimidyl suberate produced a species that had a molecular mass on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels of 5.2 X 10(4) daltons. We believe this species represents a complex between C5a and its receptor for the following reasons. The band is eliminated if the cross-linking experiment is performed in the presence of a large excess of unlabeled C5a, but is unaffected by the presence of nonspecific protein or the chemotactic factors N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe and leukotriene B4. The 5.2 X 10(4)-dalton species is not observed if the cross-linker is omitted. Finally, the dose-response curves for the inhibition of binding of 125I-C5a by unlabeled C5a and the inhibition of cross-linking are similar. Subtraction of the molecular mass of C5a from that of the complex gives a molecular mass for the binding moiety of the C5a receptor of 4.0 X 10(4) daltons."
https://openalex.org/W1591591159,"Methylotrophic yeasts induce large peroxisomes when grown on methanol. The recent ability to stabilize and isolate these peroxisomes at pH 5.5 has led to the demonstration that two polypeptides comprise the bulk of the peroxisome of Candida boidinii, alcohol oxidase, and a 79-kDa species, determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (Goodman, J.M., Scott, C.W., Donahue, P.N., and Atherton, J.P. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 8485-8493). The 79-kDa peroxisomal protein is now identified as dihydroxyacetone synthase, the first enzyme in the assimilatory pathway of formaldehyde utilization. This identification is based on several criteria: The enzyme activity is mainly in a particulate fraction at pH 5.5 but not at pH 8.0. It copurifies with alcohol oxidase and catalase on sucrose gradients. The 79-kDa protein behaves as a 135,000-kDa dimer on gel filtration, similar to the published behavior of the enzyme. The specific activity of dihydroxyacetone synthase in the pure 79-kDa preparation (3.20 units/mg of protein) is close to that reported for the purified enzyme (3.88 units/mg of protein). Antibodies against dihydroxyacetone synthase were used to show that its synthesis, induction, and assembly are similar to that of alcohol oxidase. Neither contains a detectable cleaved leader sequence and both are assembled post-translationally. The localization of dihydroxyacetone synthase to the peroxisome may influence the regulation of the two pathways of formaldehyde utilization and may protect the cell from damage by formaldehyde."
https://openalex.org/W1567519192,"Polymerization under sonication has been developed as a new method to study the rapid polymerization of actin with a large number of elongating sites. The theory proposed assumes that filaments under sonication are maintained at a constant length by the constant input of energy. The data obtained for the reversible polymerization of ADP-actin under sonication have been successfully analyzed according to the proposed model and, therefore, validate the model. The results obtained for the polymerization of ATP-actin under sonication demonstrate the involvement of ATP hydrolysis in the polymerization process. At high actin concentration, polymerization was fast enough, as compared to ATP hydrolysis on the F-actin, to obtain completion of the reversible polymerization of ATP-actin before significant hydrolysis of ATP occurred. A critical concentration of 3 microM was determined as the ratio of the dissociation and association rate constants for the interaction of ATP-actin with the ATP filament ends in 1 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM ATP. The plot of the rate of elongation of filaments versus actin monomer concentration exhibited an upward deviation at high actin concentration that is consistent with this result. The fact that F-actin at steady state is more stable than the ATP-F-actin polymer at equilibrium suggests that the interaction between ADP-actin and ATP-actin subunits at the end of the ATP-capped filament is much stronger than the interaction between two ATP-actin subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2014114376,"The regional and temporal specificity of peanut agglutinin binding was determined for early amphibian embryos. With the onset of neurulation, a receptor appears on the epidermis, but remains absent from the neural plate. A second type of receptor, largely masked by sialic acid, appears throughout the extracellular matrix. In the axolotl, the epidermal receptor is epimucin and the matrix receptor is fibronectin plus other components. Both receptors are autonomously expressed, on schedule, by appropriate explants of gastrula tissue. Expression of the epidermal receptor is suppressed after exposure to a neural inducing signal. This shows that the epidermal PNA receptor is a reliable marker of epidermal character and that neural induction affects the program of macromolecular synthesis within hours of the graft."
https://openalex.org/W1554017108,"Glycosomes, the microbody-like organelles containing mainly glycolytic enzymes, were purified from the long slender bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei EATRO 110 monomorphic strain by an improved method in which the protozoa were frozen and thawed in 15% glycerol to free, from the plasma membrane, much of the variant surface glycoprotein which used to constitute the major contaminant of our purified glycosomes. The purified glycosomes have 11 major proteins, 6 of which, tentatively identified as phosphofructose kinase, hexokinase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, constitute 87% of the total glycosomal protein. The bifunctional cross-linking reagents dimethyl suberimidate and dimethyl-3,3'-dithiobispropionimidate can penetrate the glycosomal membrane and cause extensive cross-linking of all the major glycosomal proteins. The cross-linked complex, insoluble in 0.1% Triton X-100 plus 0.15 M NaCl, contains all the glycosomal enzyme activities with only partial inactivations. All the enzymes are probably cross-linked into one large complex since they all sediment rapidly to the bottom of a 5-20% (v/v) sucrose density gradient. This successful cross-linking with reagents of span lengths of 11-12 A suggests close proximities among the glycosomal enzymes which may explain the extraordinarily high rate of glycolysis in T. brucei. Whether such a close association represents specific spatial arrangement required for genuine substrate channeling among the enzymes will be verified by future kinetic studies of the cross-linked enzyme complex."
https://openalex.org/W1580411717,"Microsomal delta 7-sterol 5-desaturase of cholesterol biosynthesis is a multienzyme system which catalyzes the introduction of the delta 5-bond into delta 7-cholestenol to form 7-dehydrocholesterol. The detergent-solubilized 5-desaturase has been purified more than 70-fold and resolved from electron carriers and other rat liver microsomal enzymes of sterol biosynthesis by chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, CM-Sepharose, and immobilized cytochrome b5; the 5-desaturase had not been fully resolved from cytochrom b5 reductase in earlier work. A functional electron transport system for the 5-desaturase has been reconstituted by combining the purified 5-desaturase and electron carriers with egg phosphatidylcholine liposomes. Optimizations of conditions for reconstitution have been obtained; both cytochrome b5 and NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase serve as electron carriers. A pyridine nucleotide-dependent flavoprotein is required and the requirement can be satisfied with either purified cytochrome b5 reductase or cytochrome P-450 reductase. Cyanide and iron-chelators strikingly inhibit the 5-desaturase activity, thus suggesting that 5-desaturase is a metalloenzyme as are other well-characterized cytochrome b5-dependent oxidases. 5-Desaturase is resolved from 4-methyl sterol oxidase activity of cholesterol biosynthesis by chromatography on the immobilized cytochrome b5. This resolution of the two oxidases not only indicates that introduction of the delta 5-bond and oxidation of 4 alpha-methyl groups are catalyzed by different terminal oxidases, but resolution affords enzymes of sufficient purity to carry out reconstitution experiments. A novel assay based on substrate-dependent increments of oxidation of alpha-NADH has been developed for measurement of 5-desaturase activity. Measurement of stoichiometry of 5-desaturase demonstrates that for each equivalent of cis-desaturation of delta 7-cholestenol, 1 eq of NADH is consumed. Along with strict dependence upon oxygen, this observation confirms, as suggested by previous workers, that the 5-desaturation is catalyzed by a mixed function oxidase rather than a dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1595362376,"The incorporation of CO-heme into single bilayer, egg lecithin vesicles was examined by following the spectral changes that occur when the porphyrin becomes embedded in the membranes. The rate of CO-heme uptake by liposomes is extremely fast (t1/2 less than or equal to 20 ms at 10 degrees C), and the maximum extent is roughly 1 heme/5 phospholipid molecules. This limiting stoichiometry is due to unfavorable electrostatic interactions between the propionate groups of the bound CO-heme. This effect was treated theoretically by attenuating the intrinsic heme partitioning equilibrium constant with an exponential term reflecting the surface potential of the membranes. The surface potential was assumed to be proportional to the concentration of CO-heme in the membranes, and the final expression is Kp = Kop exp[-AHb/VpCp], where Kp is the observed partition constant; Kop, the intrinsic constant; Hb, the concentration of bound heme in the suspension; Vp, the partial molar volume of egg lecithin; Cp, the concentration of lipid phosphate; and A, an empirical constant representing the capacitance of the membrane for heme. For the analysis of kinetic data, the electrostatic term is assumed to apply only to the membrane dissociation rate constant, k-1, and not the association rate constant, k1. The dissociation rate was measured independently either by following the transfer of CO-heme from one vesicle fraction to another or by monitoring heme efflux from the membranes and incorporation into apohemoglobin at high protein concentrations. The data for all three sets of experiments, heme uptake, transfer, and incorporation into globin at 10 degrees C, were fitted quantitatively to the partitioning mechanism using A = 15 M-1, Kop = 5 X 10(5), k1 = 2 X 10(6) s-1, and k0(-1) = 4 s-1. Thus, heme can spontaneously migrate across lipid-water interfaces and hence diffuse rapidly from the mitochondrial inner membrane where it is synthesized to the rough endoplasmic reticulum where it is incorporated into hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1606168586,"Human C5a anaphylatoxin is a complement-derived chemotactic factor that binds to specific receptors that are found in the granulocyte plasma membrane. These receptors, or a specific subunit of these receptors, can be covalently labeled with a unique photoreactive analog of human C5a. This photoaffinity probe, p-azidobenzoyl-2-mercapto-N-ethylamide-C5a (ABMEA-SC5a), was synthesized by coupling p-azidobenzoyl-2-mercapto-N-ethylamide-2'-thiopyridine disulfide to human C5a after it had been partially reduced with dithiothreitol. Both direct and competitive binding studies demonstrated that a radioiodinated ABMEA-SC5a derivative retained the capacity to specifically bind to either neutrophil or U937 cell C5a receptors. Half-maximal binding of the photoreactive analog was observed at a concentration of 1 to 2 nM, a value that is comparable to that observed when 125I-C5a is employed as the ligand. The covalent adducts that were formed after irradiation of 125I-ABMEA-SC5a that had been prebound to either neutrophil or U937 cell plasma membranes were found to have an apparent molecular mass of 52,000 daltons when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis techniques. These findings demonstrate that the C5a receptors found on human neutrophils and other granulocytes are not only functionally similar, but biochemically similar as well."
https://openalex.org/W1567904281,"Triacylglycerol synthesis in cultured rat hepatocytes was inhibited by 2-bromooctanoate with a concomitant accumulation of diacylglycerols. 2-Bromooctanoate inhibition could be ascribed to its thioesterification by medium chain fatty acyl-CoA synthase (Raaka, B.M., and Lowenstein, J.M. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 6755-6762) with 2-bromooctanoyl-CoA acting as a competitive inhibitor of diacylglycerol acyltransferase. The Ki of 2-bromooctanoyl-CoA was 1.5 microM compared with a Km of 25 microM for the palmitoyl-CoA substrate. Diacylglycerol esterification was also inhibited by C12-C16 2-bromo fatty acids. However, inhibition of triacylglycerol synthesis by long chain 2-bromo fatty acids was accompanied by decreased overall neutral lipid synthesis as a result of inhibition of the long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthase. Since 2-bromooctanoate was a poor inhibitor of the long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthase, it appears to function selectively as an inhibitor of diacylglycerol acyltransferase in cultured rat hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1536975361,"Marked kinetic differences were observed when hepatic newly synthesized cholesterol and preformed cholesterol were separately radiolabeled and separately traced into bile. Whereas newly synthesized cholesterol was not evenly distributed throughout the liver but was preferentially secreted into bile, preformed cholesterol was in near-complete equilibrium in the whole liver and bile. Furthermore, whereas newly synthesized cholesterol in bile originated from the interior of the hepatocyte, results suggest that biliary preformed cholesterol may be transported directly from the blood through the plasma membrane of the hepatocyte and secreted from the canaliculus without first entering the interior of the cell and mixing with newly synthesized cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W16972511,"Analysis of parameters governing heparin binding to fibronectin indicates that heparin binding is a necessary, but insufficient, condition for fibronectin cryoprecipitation. Heparin binding to fibronectin is a rapid, readily reversible event which can occur under several conditions which prohibit fibronectin cryoprecipitation. While cryoprecipitation of fibronectin is abolished at temperatures in excess of 10 degrees C, appreciable heparin binding to fibronectin does occur even at 40 degrees C. While increasing ionic strength and pH inhibit both heparin binding and cryoprecipitation of fibronectin, heparin binding can still occur at high ionic strengths and pH values which completely abolish cryoprecipitation. Scatchard analysis of fluorescent polarization data reveals a biphasic heparin binding curve with high and low affinity Kd values of 3.5 X 10(-8) and 10(-6) M, respectively. In contrast to heparin binding, fibronectin aggregation is a cooperative phenomenon. Fibronectin cryoprecipitation is greatly reduced at temperatures above 10 degrees C, at pH values above pH 10, and at ionic strengths above 0.3 M. Thus, heparin binding and protein aggregation are separate events which occur during fibronectin cryoprecipitation. Results obtained here via fluorescence polarization in conjunction with other physical measurements suggest that a decrease in flexibility of the fibronectin molecule is associated with the protein aggregation step of cryoprecipitation. The role of heparin in the mechanism of fibronectin cryoprecipitation is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2110872689,"The analysis of the normal expression of endogenous retroviral sequences in congenic 129 GIX+ and GIX- mouse strains suggests the action of a regulatory element, encoded by Gv-1, functioning in trans to control the expression of these sequences. At steady state, the abundance of polyadenylated retroviral transcripts of different length cosegregates with the Gv-1 genotype. The presence of low but detectable quantities of these transcripts in antigen-negative mice indicates however, that Gv-1 may be distinct from the structural genes encoding retroviral proteins. We report here that retroviral transcripts, derived from distinct proviruses, are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and are coordinately regulated by the Gv-1 locus. The structure of several of the abundant transcripts demonstrates further that they are transcribed from independent defective endogenous proviral genomes exhibiting extensive deletions of env coding regions as well as modified U3 regions distinct from those found in exogenous retroviral transcripts."

In NIH 3T3 cells that have been made resistant to G418 by transfection with a plasmid in which the mouse alpha 2(I) collagen promoter is linked to the neo gene, subsequent v-mos transformation causes a loss of G418 resistance. After mutagenesis of these v-mos-transformed cells, G418-resistant colonies were selected. Two of these G418-resistant mutants showed an increased expression of the neo gene and of the endogenous type I collagen and fibronectin genes, without changes in their levels of v-mos RNA or in their ability to induce tumors. The mutations might alter cellular trans-acting factors that either directly or indirectly control the expression of the type I collagen and fibronectin genes in transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W1576767939,"The 20-kDa fragment of myosin subfragment-1 heavy chain was cleaved with cyanogen bromide. Gel electrophoresis of the fragmented peptides indicated the presence of 20-, 18-, 16-, 14-, 12-, and 10-kDa peptides in addition to two peptides smaller than 10 kDa. The renaturation procedure of Muhlrad and Morales (Muhlrad, A., and Morales, M. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 81, 1003-1007) was applied to the mixture of these peptides. The peptides larger than 10 kDa, which contain both the reactive SH1 and SH2 groups, were precipitated with F-actin by ultracentrifugation. The 10-kDa peptide was purified and was identified as p10 of Elzinga and Collins (Elzinga, M., and Collins, J. H. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 74, 4281-4284). The renaturation procedure was applied to the purified 10-kDa peptide. The 10-kDa peptide was also precipitated with F-actin by ultracentrifugation. Affinity of the 10-kDa peptide for F-actin was determined with an increase of turbidity, and the apparent dissociation constant was 0.94 microM. Results are consistent with our proposition that a binding site for F-actin exists around the SH1 and SH2 groups of subfragment-1 (Katoh, T., Imae, S., and Morita, F. (1984) J.

https://openalex.org/W1536642642,"The involvement of interactions between ATP-actin and ADP-actin in actin polymerization has been studied. It has been found that ATP-actin and ADP-actin can copolymerize and that the rate of nucleation is enhanced when both ATP-actin and ADP-actin are present in solution. The fact that the heterologous interaction between ATP-actin (T) and ADP-actin (D) is stronger than either of the homologous reactions, T-T and D-D, agrees with the kinetic data in the accompanying paper (Carlier, M.-F., Pantaloni, D., and Korn, E.D.

These data are incorporated into a model for actin polymerization in ATP in which the kinetic parameters for polymerization depend on the nature of the nucleotide (ADP or ATP) bound to the three terminal subunits of the actin filament."
https://openalex.org/W1580143901,"When intact rat liver Golgi vesicles were incubated with [acetyl-3H]acetyl coenzyme A, radioactivity was incorporated into the vesicles in a manner dependent upon temperature, time, protein, and acetyl-CoA concentration. The vesicles concentrated the label 121-fold relative to the medium within 20 min, suggesting an active transport mechanism operating in intact vesicles, and incorporated more than 50% of this label into acid-insoluble materials. This was supported by the finding that incorporation was markedly reduced by Triton X-100 at levels above its critical micellar concentration. While the intravesicular low molecular weight fraction was predominantly free acetate, acetate ions themselves were not permeant to the vesicles. Double-label experiments suggested that the transport process involved the entire acetyl-CoA molecule. This was further supported by the fact that coenzyme ASH, palmitoyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA were markedly inhibitory. Incorporation was optimal at 22 degrees C at pH 7.0, and was moderately stimulated by ATP. However, compounds known to abolish proton gradients or to inhibit the Golgi proton pump had no effect. The apparent Km for the utilization process was 0.61 microM with a Vmax of 21.3 pmol/mg of protein/min. Oligomycin and 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'disulfonic acid were inhibitory, whereas CMP-NeuAc, UDP-GlcNAc, adenosine 3'-phosphate, 5'-phosphosulfate, atractylosides, tunicamycin, 2'5'-ADP, and 3',5'-ADP were not, showing that this transport process is distinct from other nucleotide transporters previously described in rat liver Golgi. 75-85% of the radioactivity incorporated was shown to be in O-acetylated sialic acids, by neuraminidase release, purification, and high pressure liquid chromatography. The majority of the neuraminidase-resistant radioactivity was released by alkaline hydroxylamine as [3H]acetylhydroxamate, but a significant fraction was resistant to this treatment. The nature of the non-sialic acid radioactivity remains unknown. The existence of this transport mechanism provides yet another level at which the O-acetylation of sialic acids could be regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1542146707,"The effects of ionic strength on the conformation around the SH groups of the proteins and the lipid fluidity of porcine intestinal brush border membranes were studied using two fluorescent dyes, N-[7-dimethylamino-4-methylcoumarinyl]maleimide (DACM) and pyrene. The extent of DACM labeling to the SH groups of the membrane proteins was accelerated depending on the KCl concentrations in medium. A quenching study of DACM-labeled membranes with acrylamide showed that the proximity of the quencher to the fluorescence-labeled SH groups in the membrane proteins is increased with increasing ionic strength of medium. An implication of the conformational changes around SH groups in the membrane proteins with increase of ionic strength was also obtained from the stimulation of guanidine effect on the fluorescence parameters of DACM-labeled membranes by addition of KCl. On the other hand, the results of the quenching study with KI, excimer fluorescence, and polarization measurements of pyrene-labeled membranes suggested an increase of membrane fluidity on addition of KCl to medium. The temperature dependence of polarization of the complex strongly suggested that the rotational freedom of pyrene molecules embedded into the lipid layers of the membranes is increased by addition of KCl. In fact, the harmonic means of the rotational relaxation times of pyrene molecules in the membranes with and without 100 mM KCl were estimated to be about 2900 and 9000 ns at 25 degrees C, respectively. Based on these results, the salt-induced alterations of the conformation in the vicinity of the bound dyes of the membrane proteins and of the membrane fluidity are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1594945063,"The metabolism of 3-mercaptopropionic acid in mitochondria was studied by use of purified mitochondrial enzymes and rat heart mitochondria. Metabolites of 3-mercaptopropionic acid were separated by high performance liquid chromatography and identified by comparing them with chemically synthesized derivatives of 3-mercaptopropionic acid. The initial step in the metabolism of 3-mercaptopropionic acid is its conversion to a CoA thioester, most likely catalyzed by medium-chain acyl-CoA synthetase. The resulting 3-mercaptopropionyl-CoA is a poor substrate of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase but substitutes effectively for CoASH in reactions catalyzed by 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase and acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase. S-Acyl-3-mercaptopropionyl-CoA thioesters formed in the thiolase-catalyzed reactions are not at all or only poorly acted upon by acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. However, they are hydrolyzed by thioesterase(s) to CoASH and S-acyl-3-mercaptopropionic acid. The hydrolysis of S-acyl-3-mercaptopropionyl-CoA thioesters proceeds more rapidly than the hydrolysis of fatty acyl-CoA thioesters of comparable chain lengths. Free CoASH is also regenerated from S-acetyl-3-mercaptopropionyl-CoA and more rapidly from 3-mercaptopropionyl-CoA as a result of their reactions with carnitine catalyzed by carnitine acetyltransferase. These findings lead to the suggestion that the major mitochondrial CoA-containing metabolites of 3-mercaptopropionic acid are S-acyl-3-mercaptopropionyl-CoA thioesters."

These proteins have been separated from other labeled bands by ammonium sulfate fractionation, and the 32-kDa polypeptide has been further purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange, gel filtration, and hydroxylapatite chromatography. In aqueous buffers at pH 7, the 32-kDa protein catalyzes the hydrolysis of tetradecanoyl-CoA at a low rate (0.01 mumol/min/mg) to form free fatty acids. The thioesterase rate is slightly increased by phosphate, which also protects the enzyme against inhibition by the sulfhydryl reagent N-ethylmaleimide. Acyl-CoA cleavage is dramatically stimulated (up to 100-fold) by certain organic solvents, in particular glycerol and ethylene glycol, with the fatty acyl group being transferred to the alcohol acceptors. These enzymatic properties may be related to the role of the 32-kDa esterase in generating fatty acids for subsequent use in the V. harveyi bioluminescent system."

Co-eIF-2, but not Co-eIF-2A80, was effective in promoting [3H]GDP displacement and the former was more effective in promoting ternary complex formation than the latter. 6) eIF-2 X [3H]GDP was converted to eIF-2 X [3H] GTP by incubation in the presence of nucleoside-5'-diphosphate kinase and ATP, but the eIF-2 X [3H]GTP thus formed did not bind Met-tRNAf in the presence of Mg2+ and required exogeneous addition of Co-eIF-2 and GTP for ternary complex formation and GTP displacement. 7) In the absence of Mg2+, the increased ternary complex formed in the presence of eIF-2 X [3H] GDP and Co-eIF-2A80 (with accompanying loss of [3H] GDP) was inactive in a subsequent reaction, which involves Met-tRNAf transfer to 40 S ribosomes (in the presence of Mg2+), and required trace amounts of Co-eIF-2 for such activity. Based on the above observations, we have suggested a two-step activation of eIF-2 molecules by the Co-eIF-2 protein complex for functional ternary complex formation. One of these steps involves the Co-eIF-2A component of Co-eIF-2. This activation results in stimulated Met-tRNAf binding to eIF-2 and is most apparent in the absence of Mg2+ and with aged eIF-2 molecules.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1636636718,"Transport of gamma-glutamyl amino acids, a step in the proposed glutathione-gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase-mediated amino acid transport pathway, was examined in mouse kidney. The transport of gamma-glutamyl amino acids was demonstrated in vitro in studies on kidney slices. Transport was followed by measuring uptake of 35S after incubation of the slices in media containing gamma-glutamyl methionine [35S]sulfone. The experimental complication associated with extracellular conversion of the gamma-glutamyl amino acid to amino acid and uptake of the latter by slices was overcome by using 5-oxoproline formation (catalyzed by intracellular gamma-glutamyl-cyclotransferase) as an indicator of gamma-glutamyl amino acid transport. This method was also successfully applied to studies on transport of gamma-glutamyl amino acids in vivo. Transport of gamma-glutamyl amino acids in vitro and in vivo is inhibited by several inhibitors of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and also by high extracellular levels of glutathione. This seems to explain urinary excretion of gamma-glutamylcystine by humans with gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase deficiency and by mice treated with inhibitors of this enzyme. Mice depleted of glutathione by treatment with buthionine sulfoximine (which inhibits glutathione synthesis) or by treatment with 2,6-dimethyl-2,5-heptadiene-4-one (which effectively interacts with tissue glutathione) exhibited significantly less transport of gamma-glutamyl amino acids than did untreated controls. The findings suggest that intracellular glutathione functions in transport of gamma-glutamyl amino acids. Evidence was also obtained for transport of gamma-glutamyl gamma-glutamylphenylalanine into kidney slices."

This promotion occurs whether the substrate is exogenous or preincorporated into microsomes. Similarly, SCP promotes an intermembrane transfer of lathosterol from one microsomal population to another (Ishibashi, T., and Bloch, K. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 12962-12967). Here we present evidence for an SCP-mediated collisional interaction which results in the intermembrane transfer of sterol substrate and excludes a conventional substrate-carrier mechanism for SCP. Radioactive carboxymethyl SCP is shown to bind to microsomes and to anionic phospholipids but not to phosphatidylcholine. Treatment of microsomes with trypsin, but not with phospholipase A2, reduces SCP binding. Binding studies with small molecules substantiate the identity of SCP with Z-protein."

Crude ZMF and purified ZMF display indistinguishable sensitivities/insensitivities to inactivations by several different chemical or enzymatic treatments.

The inactivation analyses have provided substantial evidence that ZMF is a newly discovered SH-containing cyclic ribotide. At least one SH-containing side group and at least one free amino group linked to an imidazole, as well as a ribosyl moiety containing a cyclic 3',5'-phosphate, a 2'-free hydroxyl, and a 1'-linkage to the imidazole, appear to be essential structural requirements for ZMF-mediated encystment blockage. The proposed structure of biologically functional ZMF is similar to that of a key intermediate in the de novo pathway of purine nucleotide biosynthesis (5'-phosphoribosyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-N-succino-carboxamide), except that ZMF, and not 5'-phosphoribosyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-N-succinocarboxamide, contains a cyclic phosphate and at least one reduced SH group."
