Lin et al. found that an ionic solid, a piperidinium salt, enhanced the efficiency of positive-intrinsic-negative layered perovskite solar cells with organic electron and hole extraction layers. Aggressive aging testing showed that this additive retarded segregation into impurity phases and pinhole formation in the perovskite layer. Science , this issue p. 96"

Understanding the limitations placed by a species's physiology can help to determine whether it has an immediate potential to deal with rapid change. Many studies have looked at physiological tolerance to climate change in fishes, with results indicating a range of responses. Dahlke et al. conducted a meta-analysis to explore how life stage may influence a species's ability to tolerate temperature change (see the Perspective by Sunday). They found that embryos and breeding adult fishes are much more susceptible to temperature change than those in other life stages and that this factor must therefore be considered in evaluations of susceptibility.

Laudadio et al. now report a convenient method to add ethane and propane directly across conjugated olefins with no prefunctionalization or byproducts (see the Perspective by Oksdath-Mansilla). The C–H bond scission in this hydroalkylation is accomplished by a decatungstate photocatalyst that also acts as a hydrogen atom transfer agent to complete the process. The reaction, optimized under flow conditions, works with methane as well, albeit with lower efficiency. Science , this issue p. 92 ; see also p. 34"
https://openalex.org/W3039666655,"Lack of access to safe drinking water is a global problem, and methods to reliably and easily detect contaminants could be transformative. We report the development of a cell-free in vitro transcription system that uses RNA Output Sensors Activated by Ligand Induction (ROSALIND) to detect contaminants in water. A combination of highly processive RNA polymerases, allosteric protein transcription factors and synthetic DNA transcription templates regulates the synthesis of a fluorescence-activating RNA aptamer. The presence of a target contaminant induces the transcription of the aptamer, and a fluorescent signal is produced. We apply ROSALIND to detect a range of water contaminants, including antibiotics, small molecules and metals. We also show that adding RNA circuitry can invert responses, reduce crosstalk and improve sensitivity without protein engineering. The ROSALIND system can be freeze-dried for easy storage and distribution, and we apply it in the field to test municipal water supplies, demonstrating its potential use for monitoring water quality. Water contaminants are detected with freeze-dried, regulated in vitro transcription reactions."

Similarly to neurons and synapses, excess myelin sheaths are produced and selectively eliminated, but how elimination occurs is unknown. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, engulf surplus neurons and synapses. To determine whether microglia also prune myelin sheaths, we used zebrafish to visualize and manipulate interactions between microglia, oligodendrocytes, and neurons during development. We found that microglia closely associate with oligodendrocytes and specifically phagocytose myelin sheaths. By using a combination of optical, genetic, chemogenetic, and behavioral approaches, we reveal that neuronal activity bidirectionally balances microglial association with neuronal cell bodies and myelin phagocytosis in the optic tectum. Furthermore, multiple strategies to deplete microglia resulted in oligodendrocytes maintaining excessive and ectopic myelin. Our work reveals a neuronal activity-regulated role for microglia in modifying developmental myelin targeting by oligodendrocytes. Microglia refine the developing CNS by engulfing excess neurons and synapses. Hughes and Appel here show that microglia also prune myelin sheaths in a neuronal activity-regulated manner to sculpt developmental myelination."

Although the combination of muscarinic-based DREADDs with clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) has been widely used, sluggish kinetics, metabolic liabilities and potential off-target effects of CNO represent areas for improvement. Here, we provide a new high-affinity and selective agonist deschloroclozapine (DCZ) for muscarinic-based DREADDs. Positron emission tomography revealed that DCZ selectively bound to and occupied DREADDs in both mice and monkeys. Systemic delivery of low doses of DCZ (1 or 3 μg per kg) enhanced neuronal activity via hM3Dq within minutes in mice and monkeys. Intramuscular injections of DCZ (100 μg per kg) reversibly induced spatial working memory deficits in monkeys expressing hM4Di in the prefrontal cortex. DCZ represents a potent, selective, metabolically stable and fast-acting DREADD agonist with utility in both mice and nonhuman primates for a variety of applications. Deschloroclozapine (DCZ) is a broadly useful chemogenetic agonist for studies using nonhuman primates and mice. DCZ rapidly and reversibly activates DREADDs, and its binding can be visualized noninvasively by positron emission tomography."

The thin-film materials of which capacitors are composed are usually optimized by changing the material composition. However, Kim et al. found that postprocessing an already effective thin-film dielectric by high-energy ion bombardment further improved the material because of the introduction of specific types of defects that ultimately improved the energy storage performance. The results suggest that postprocessing may be important for developing the next generation of capacitors. Science , this issue p. 81"

https://openalex.org/W3034712727,"The gut microbiome is the resident microbial community of the gastrointestinal tract. This community is highly diverse, but how microbial diversity confers resistance or susceptibility to intestinal pathogens is poorly understood. Using transplantation of human microbiomes into several animal models of infection, we show that key microbiome species shape the chemical environment of the gut through the activity of the enzyme bile salt hydrolase. The activity of this enzyme reduced colonization by the major human diarrheal pathogen Vibrio cholerae by degrading the bile salt taurocholate that activates the expression of virulence genes. The absence of these functions and species permits increased infection loads on a personal microbiome-specific basis. These findings suggest new targets for individualized preventative strategies of V. cholerae infection through modulating the structure and function of the gut microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W3040644265,"In March 2020, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the UK Government imposed social and physical distancing measures on the population. These lockdown measures caused significant changes to all aspects of daily life. The current study examined how the passage of time was distorted during the lockdown period. Using an online questionnaire, day and week passage of time judgments were collected. In addition, measures of affect, task load and satisfaction with current levels of social interaction were taken. The results show that over 80% of participants experienced distortion to the passage of time during lockdown in comparison with normal. The passage of time during the day was predicted by age, stress, task load and satisfaction with current levels of social interaction. A slowing of the passage of time was associated with increasing age, increasing stress, reduced task load and reduced satisfaction with current levels of social interaction. Only age and satisfaction with current levels of social interaction predicted passage of time across a week. Again, increasing age and reduced satisfaction with levels of social interaction were associated with a slowing of the passage of time. These findings demonstrate that significant changes to daily life have a significant impact on our experience of time, with younger, more socially satisfied people more likely to experience time as passing more quickly during the lockdown."
https://openalex.org/W3038942960,"Many chromatin-binding proteins and protein complexes that regulate transcription also bind RNA. One of these, Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), deposits the H3K27me3 mark of facultative heterochromatin and is required for stem cell differentiation. PRC2 binds RNAs broadly in vivo and in vitro. Yet, the biological importance of this RNA binding remains unsettled. Here, we tackle this question in human induced pluripotent stem cells by using multiple complementary approaches. Perturbation of RNA-PRC2 interaction by RNase A, by a chemical inhibitor of transcription or by an RNA-binding-defective mutant all disrupted PRC2 chromatin occupancy and localization genome wide. The physiological relevance of PRC2-RNA interactions is further underscored by a cardiomyocyte differentiation defect upon genetic disruption. We conclude that PRC2 requires RNA binding for chromatin localization in human pluripotent stem cells and in turn for defining cellular state."

https://openalex.org/W3039546350,"Single-molecule long-read DNA sequencing with biological nanopores is fast and high-throughput but suffers reduced accuracy in homonucleotide stretches. We now combine the CsgG nanopore with the 35-residue N-terminal region of its extracellular interaction partner CsgF to produce a dual-constriction pore with improved signal and base-calling accuracy for homopolymer regions. The electron cryo-microscopy structure of CsgG in complex with full-length CsgF shows that the 33 N-terminal residues of CsgF bind inside the β-barrel of the pore, forming a defined second constriction. In complexes of CsgG bound to a 35-residue CsgF constriction peptide, the second constriction is separated from the primary constriction by ~25 A. We find that both constrictions contribute to electrical signal modulation during single-stranded DNA translocation. DNA sequencing using a prototype CsgG–CsgF protein pore with two constrictions improved single-read accuracy by 25 to 70% in homopolymers up to 9 nucleotides long. Equipping a protein nanopore with a second constriction improves sequencing of homopolymer DNA stretches."

However, they contain a copper-binding site for which the biological relevance is unknown. Copper homeostasis is critical for several fundamental eukaryotic processes, including mitochondrial respiration. Attar et al. hypothesized that histones may play a critical role in cellular copper utilization (see the Perspective by Rudolph and Luger). Using a multifaceted approach ranging from in vitro biochemistry to in vivo genetic and molecular analyses, they found that the histone H3-H4 tetramer is an oxidoreductase enzyme that catalyzes reduction of cupric ions, thereby providing biologically usable cuprous ions for various cellular processes.

It then searches for causal noncoding variants that may introduce aberrant transcription factor binding motifs or enhancer hijacking by structural variations. Analysis of 13 T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias identified a recurrent intronic variant predicted to cis-activate the TAL1 oncogene, a finding validated in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing of a patient-derived xenograft. Candidate oncogenes include the prolactin receptor PRLR activated by a focal deletion that removes a CTCF-insulated neighborhood boundary. cis-X may be applied to pediatric and adult solid tumors that are aneuploid and heterogeneous. In contrast to existing approaches, which require large sample cohorts, cis-X enables the discovery of regulatory noncoding variants in individual cancer genomes."

https://openalex.org/W3038664152,"Peptide ligands of class B G-protein-coupled receptors act via a two-step binding process, but the essential mechanisms that link their extracellular binding to intracellular receptor-arrestin interactions are not fully understood. Using NMR, crosslinking coupled to mass spectrometry, signaling experiments and computational approaches on the parathyroid hormone (PTH) type 1 receptor (PTHR), we show that initial binding of the PTH C-terminal part constrains the conformation of the flexible PTH N-terminal signaling epitope before a second binding event occurs. A 'hot-spot' PTH residue, His9, that inserts into the PTHR transmembrane domain at this second step allosterically engages receptor-arrestin coupling. A conformational change in PTHR intracellular loop 3 permits favorable interactions with β-arrestin's finger loop. These results unveil structural determinants for PTHR-arrestin complex formation and reveal that the two-step binding mechanism proceeds via cooperative fluctuations between ligand and receptor, which extend to other class B G-protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W3039819529,"Tumor progression is governed by various growth factors and cytokines in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Among these, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is secreted by various cell types residing in the TME and promotes tumor progression by inducing the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cells and tumor angiogenesis. TGF-β comprises three isoforms, TGF-β1, -β2, and -β3, and transduces intracellular signals via TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) and TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII). For the purpose of designing ligand traps that reduce oncogenic signaling in the TME, chimeric proteins comprising the ligand-interacting ectodomains of receptors fused with the Fc portion of immunoglobulin are often used. For example, chimeric soluble TβRII (TβRII-Fc) has been developed as an effective therapeutic strategy for targeting TGF-β ligands, but several lines of evidence indicate that TβRII-Fc more effectively traps TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 than TGF-β2, whose expression is elevated in multiple cancer types. In the present study, we developed a chimeric TGF-β receptor containing both TβRI and TβRII (TβRI-TβRII-Fc) and found that TβRI-TβRII-Fc trapped all TGF-β isoforms, leading to inhibition of both the TGF-β signal and TGF-β–induced EMT of oral cancer cells, whereas TβRII-Fc failed to trap TGF-β2. Furthermore, we found that TβRI-TβRII-Fc suppresses tumor growth and angiogenesis more effectively than TβRII-Fc in a subcutaneous xenograft model of oral cancer cells with high TGF-β expression. These results suggest that TβRI-TβRII-Fc may be a promising tool for targeting all TGF-β isoforms in the TME.

These results suggest that TβRI-TβRII-Fc may be a promising tool for targeting all TGF-β isoforms in the TME. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex system comprising tumor cells, stromal cells, endothelial cells, immune cells, and the extracellular matrix. The TME plays important roles during tumor progression via growth regulation and metastasis of cancer cells (1Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation.Cell. 2011; 144 (21376230): 646-67410.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42748) Google Scholar). Recent lines of evidence have revealed that the TME composition changes during tumor progression in response to oncogenic signals from tumor cells; therefore, effective anti-tumor therapies should target not only cancer cells but also other TME components. Cells in the TME secrete various growth factors and cytokines to create a microenvironment favoring tumorigenesis. Among these factors, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is secreted by various cell types residing in the TME. The pleiotropic functions of TGF-β, including not only the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis but also cell motility and invasion, have been widely studied (2Morikawa M. Derynck R. Miyazono K. TGF-β and the TGF-β family: context-dependent roles in cell and tissue physiology.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8 (27141051): a02187310.1101/cshperspect.a021873Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Although TGF-β can function as an early-stage tumor suppressor, it may also act as a tumor promoter (3Miyazono K. Katsuno Y. Koinuma D. Ehata S. Morikawa M. Intracellular and extracellular TGF-β signaling in cancer: some recent topics.Front. Med. 2018; 12 (30043220): 387-41110.1007/s11684-018-0646-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). TGF-β appears to create a favorable TME for cancer cells, stimulating cancer metastasis (3Miyazono K. Katsuno Y. Koinuma D. Ehata S. Morikawa M. Intracellular and extracellular TGF-β signaling in cancer: some recent topics.Front. Med. 2018; 12 (30043220): 387-41110.1007/s11684-018-0646-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These dual roles in tumorigenesis likely depend on an increased level of active TGF-β within the TME as well as dysregulation of TGF-β signaling pathways that leads to the reprogramming of the cellular signals that drive tumorigenesis. TGF-β comprises three isoforms, TGF-β1, -β2, and -β3. All three isoforms share high sequence similarity and essentially signal through the same receptors; however, their effects on tumorigenesis may depend on the cellular context and differences in their temporal and spatial expressions (4Heldin C.-H. Moustakas A. Signaling receptors for TGF-β family members.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8 (27481709): a02205310.1101/cshperspect.a022053Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The canonical TGF-β signaling pathway relies on the activation of Smad transcription factors upon binding of TGF-βs to their transmembrane receptors: TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) and TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII). Binding of TGF-β to TβRII stimulates phosphorylation of TβRI, leading to the activation of Smad transcription factors and expression of direct target genes (5Derynck R. Budi E.H.

TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 bind with the high affinity to TβRII dimers in the absence of TβRI; however, TGF-β2 exhibits lower affinity for dimers formed by either TβRI or TβRII (6Baardsnes J. Hinck C.S.

O'Connor-McCourt M.D. TβR-II discriminates the high- and low-affinity TGF-β isoforms via two hydrogen-bonded ion pairs.Biochemistry. 2009; 48 (19161338): 2146-215510.1021/bi8019004Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 7Ehrlich M.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a common malignant tumor of the head and neck region. It represents the sixth most common cancer in the world, with over 300,000 cases diagnosed and 145,000 deaths annually (16Riviera C. Essentials of oral cancer.Int. J. Clin. Exp. Pathol. 2015; 8 (26617944): 11884-1189410.5281/zenodo.192487PubMed Google Scholar). Despite treatment advances, the survival of patients with OSCC has not significantly improved in recent decades. OSCC has a poor clinical outcome due to primary metastases to the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, or other distant organs. High TGF-β expression has been detected in specimens obtained from patients with oral cancer cells metastasizing to bones (17Nakamura R. Kayamori K. Oue E. Sakamoto K. Harada K. Yamaguchi A.

Moreover, we previously reported that TGF-β signals could stimulate oral cancer cell migration (18Takahashi K. Podyma-Inoue K.A. Takao C. Yoshimatsu Y. Muramatsu T. Inazawa J. Watabe T. Regulatory role of transforming growth factor-β signals in the migration and tumor formation of HOC313-LM cells, an oral squamous cell carcinoma.J. Stomatological Soc. Jpn. 2018; 85: 52-61Google Scholar), suggesting the important role of TGF-β in oral cancer progression. TGF-β increases the migratory and invasive properties of cancer cells via inducing EMT, a process during which epithelial cells lose their apical-basal polarity, becoming more motile and invasive by gaining properties attributed to mesenchymal cells (19Nieto M.A. Huang R.Y. Jackson R.A. Thiery J.P. EMT: 2016.Cell. 2016; 166 (27368099): 21-4510.1016/j.cell.2016.06.028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2712) Google Scholar). TGF-β signals induce the expression of various EMT-related transcription factors, resulting in decreased expression of proteins participating in cell junction complexes (e.g. E-cadherin and claudin-1). Down-regulation of the epithelial cell markers is accompanied by increased expression of multiple mesenchymal marker genes (e.g. smooth muscle protein 22α (SM22α), vimentin, or matrix metalloproteinases) that results in reorganization of cell cytoskeletal architecture and a mesenchymal and invasive phenotype in cancer cells (20Moustakas A.

Various strategies targeting the TGF-β signals have been used to develop effective anti-tumor therapies, with several clinical studies under way (21Huynh L.K. Hipolito C.J. ten Dijke P.

Many trials were based on the development of antibodies targeting TGF-β to prevent its binding to its receptors. Fresolimumab (GC1008), a mAb neutralizing all TGF-β isoforms, has been tested in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (22Morris J.C. Tan A.R. Olencki T.E. Shapiro G.I. Dezube B.J. Reiss M. Hsu F.J.

Small molecules have also been developed to inhibit TGF-β signaling by targeting the kinase activity of TGF-β receptors. Among them, galunisertib (LY2157299) is in the advanced phases of clinical trials media for the treatment of hepatocellular and pancreatic adenocarcinomas (NCT02423343) (24Yingling J.M. McMillen W.T.

Other approaches, involving belagenpumatucel-L, a vaccine including cancer cell lines modified with antisense TGF-β2 for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer, are also in progress (25Giaccone G.

However, despite promising results, some of those therapeutic strategies show limited efficacy or show skin and heart toxicity (26Colak S. ten Dijke P.

Other attempts have been made to develop ligand trap-based strategies. Ligand traps are chimeric proteins comprising the ligand-interacting ectodomains of receptors fused with human IgG1 Fc domains. Ligand traps are promising tools that can be used to reduce the concentrations of ligands in the extracellular environment. Several chimeric proteins capable of inhibiting TGF-β have been designed and successfully tested, demonstrating their efficacy for selective blocking of TGF-β family ligands in pathological conditions (27Yung L.M.

TGF-β2 signaling requires the formation of a functional complex between TβRI and TβRII (7Ehrlich M. Gutman O. Knaus P. Henis Y.I.

However, due to difficulties in precisely controlling the effective concentration of both ligand traps and differences in the half-lives of TGF-β receptor types, this method may not be useful for in vivo applications. To overcome these problems, in the present study, we developed a molecular ligand trap, TβRI-TβRII-Fc, a chimeric protein that interacted with all TGF-β isoforms. We also showed its effective application in vitro to inhibit TGF-β signals and in vivo to inhibit tumor growth of oral cancer cells, thus demonstrating the chimeric Fc molecular trap as a promising tool for the development of effective TME-targeted therapies. A previous report demonstrated that the soluble extracellular domain of the TGF-β type II receptor fused to the Fc portion of human IgG (TβRII-Fc) inhibited the biological activities of TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 but not TGF-β2 (29del Re E. Babitt J.L. Pirani A. Schneyer A.L. Lin H.Y. In the absence of type III receptor, the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β type II-B receptor requires the type I receptor to bind TGF-β2.J. Biol.

Moreover, the inhibitory effects of TβRII-Fc were strengthened by the addition of the soluble TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI-Fc) (29del Re E. Babitt J.L. Pirani A. Schneyer A.L. Lin H.Y. In the absence of type III receptor, the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β type II-B receptor requires the type I receptor to bind TGF-β2.J. Biol.

To examine these effects, we constructed expression plasmids encoding TβRI-Fc, TβRII-Fc, and Fc alone (Control-Fc), as a negative control (Fig. 1A). The chimeric proteins were efficiently expressed in HEK293T cells and secreted into culture media, as shown in immunoblots with anti-human IgG-Fc antibodies (Fig. 1B). We first examined whether constructed chimeric proteins are able to trap TGF-β ligands using ELISA (Fig. 1C). As expected, TβRI-Fc chimeric protein did not exhibit significant interaction with any of TGF-β isoforms as compared with Control-Fc (negative control). On the other hand, recombinant TβRII-Fc chimeric protein could interact with immobilized TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 proteins, but not with TGF-β2. Next, we examined the ability of various Fc chimeric proteins to inhibit TGF-β signals using HEK-Blue TGF-β reporter cells. The HEK-Blue TGF-β reporter system allows direct monitoring of TGF-β signaling by quantification of secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP), which is expressed under the control of Smad2/3/4-inducible elements. HEK-Blue TGF-β reporter cells treated with any of the three TGF-β isoforms, TGF-β1, -β2, or -β3, could activate the TGF-β signal transduction pathway, as revealed by increased SEAP activity (Fig. 1D). Preincubation of TGF-βs with conditioned media of HEK293T cells expressing Control-Fc or TβRI-Fc did not decrease the level of the TGF-β signal (Fig. 1D). Although TβRII-Fc chimeric protein could significantly inhibit the signal activated by TGF-β1 and TGF-β3, it did not suppress signals generated in response to the TGF-β2 isoform. Similar results were also obtained for the combination of both chimeric proteins, TβRI-Fc and TβRII-Fc. This mixture was sufficient to inhibit TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 but not TGF-β2 signals (Fig. 1D). To target all TGF-β isoforms, we generated Fc chimeric receptors containing both TGF-β type I and II receptors (TβRI-TβRII-Fc: Fig. 1, A and B) and found that the TβRI-TβRII-Fc chimeric protein could interact not only with TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 proteins, but also with TGF-β2 (Fig. 1C). Consistent with these results, TβRI-TβRII-Fc effectively inhibited the signals mediated by all three isoforms (Fig. 1D). Whereas we observed that 50 ng of TβRI-TβRII-Fc chimeric protein inhibited the signals induced by all TGF-β isoforms, smaller amounts of TβRI-TβRII-Fc (5 and 10 ng) were not capable of effectively inhibiting TGF-β2 but significantly inhibited both TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 (Fig. S2), suggesting the dose-dependent effect of this chimeric protein. The dose-dependent effect was also observed for TβRII-Fc chimeric protein, toward TGF-β1 and -β3 ligands, with no effect on TGF-β2 (Fig. S2), strengthening the conclusion that only TβRI-TβRII-Fc chimeric protein traps all isotypes of TGF-β. We next studied the specificity of the inhibitory capacity of TβRI-TβRII-Fc. Whereas activin A, a member of the TGF-β family, binds to activin type I and II receptors that are distinct from TGF-β receptors, it also activates Smad2/3/4 signals in HEK-Blue TGF-β reporter cells. This effect could be abolished by SB431542, an inhibitor of TGF-β and activin type I receptors (Fig. 1E). In contrast, none of the Fc chimeras trapped activin A (Fig. 1E), suggesting that TβRI-TβRII-Fc can trap all TGF-β isoforms but not activin A. High TGF-β2 expression is correlated with poor head and neck cancer patient survival, as suggested by Kaplan–Meier analysis (Fig. S1B). Thus, we used SAS cells, an OSCC cell line, to examine whether TGF-β receptor-Fc chimeras could be used to change the extracellular milieu of cancer cells and influence their response to TGF-β present in the extracellular environment. We first tested the effect of chimeric proteins on TGF-β signaling in SAS cells. SAS cells were incubated in conditioned media derived from HEK293T cells expressing Fc chimeric proteins in the absence or presence of TGF-β1, -β2, or -β3, respectively, followed by an analysis of the expression of transmembrane prostate androgen–induced protein (TMEPAI; PMEPA1), a direct downstream target of TGF-β, by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). As shown in Fig. 2A, increased TMEPAI expression was detected in control SAS cells treated with either TGF-β isoform. As expected, the presence of SB431542 decreased TMEPAI expression to the control level (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the results obtained in the HEK-Blue TGF-β reporter system, TMEPAI was not inhibited in cells treated with TGF-β in the presence of either Control-Fc or the TβRI-Fc. The TβRII-Fc chimeric protein inhibited TMEPAI expression induced by either TGF-β1 or TGF-β3 and had no effect on cells incubated with the TGF-β2 isoform. The inhibition of signals generated upon incubation with any of the three isoforms was observed only in the presence of the TβRI-TβRII-Fc chimeric protein (Fig. 2A), suggesting that only TβRI-TβRII-Fc protein is a potent inhibitor of all three TGF-β isoforms. The inhibitory effect of TβRI-TβRII-Fc on all three TGF-β isoforms was confirmed by the analysis of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1; SERPINE1) expression, another gene directly regulated by TGF-β. Up-regulation of PAI-1 induced by any of the three TGF-β isoforms was inhibited only in the presence of TβRI-TβRII-Fc chimeric protein and not the other chimeric proteins, TβRI-Fc or TβRII-Fc (Fig. 2B). To generalize the findings obtained in SAS oral cancer cells, we utilized another OSCC cell line, HSC-4. Expression of TMEPAI (Fig. S3A) and PAI-1 (Fig. S3B) induced in the presence of TGF-β2 was suppressed only upon incubation in conditioned medium derived from HEK293T cells expressing TβRI-TβRII-Fc but not the other chimeric receptors. These results suggest that TβRI-TβRII-Fc chimeric protein effectively inhibits the signals mediated by all TGF-β isoforms in multiple types of OSCC cells, whereas TβRII-Fc protein fails to inhibit TGF-β2–mediated signals. As TGF-β is a potent inducer of EMT in various types of cancer (20Moustakas A. Heldin C.-H. Mechanisms of TGFβ-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition.J. Clin.

SAS cells were treated with each TGF-β isoform or SB431542 for 72 h, and the expression of various epithelial and mesenchymal markers was assessed by qRT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 3, SAS cells incubated with any of the three TGF-β isoforms showed decreased expression of genes encoding the epithelial markers, E-cadherin and claudin-1 (Fig. 3, A and B), accompanied by increased expression of the mesenchymal cell markers, SM22α, vimentin, and fibronectin (Fig. 3, C–E), suggesting that SAS cells undergo EMT in response to each TGF-β isoform. In contrast, inhibition of TGF-β signals with SB431542 increased the expression of the E-cadherin (Fig. 3A) and significantly decreased the expression of SM22α and fibronectin (Fig. 3, C and E). The effects of TGF-β isoforms on the expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers were essentially confirmed at the protein level by immunoblotting and immunocytochemical analyses (Fig. 3, F and G).

However, the results were controversial. The Patient-Oriented Strategies Encompassing IndividualizeD Oocyte Number (POSEIDON) stratification is a set of newly established criteria for low prognosis patients. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of dual-trigger for final oocyte maturation on the in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes of patients who fulfill the POSEIDON group 4 criteria. Methods This retrospective cohort study investigated 384 cycles fulfilling the POSEIDON group 4 criteria. The patients underwent IVF treatment using the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol. The study group contained 194 cycles that received dual-trigger (human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG] plus GnRH-agonist) for final oocyte maturation. The control group included 114 cycles where final oocyte maturation was performed with only hCG. Baseline characteristics and cycle parameters, as well as IVF outcomes of both groups were compared. Results Baseline characteristics were similar between the dual trigger group and the control group. In terms of IVF outcomes, the dual trigger group demonstrated significantly higher number of retrieved oocytes, metaphase II oocytes, fertilized oocytes, day-3 embryos, and top-quality day-3 embryos. A statistically significant improvement in clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate was also observed in the dual trigger group. Conclusions Our data suggests that dual trigger for final oocyte maturation might improve clinical pregnancy rates and live birth rates of IVF cycles in patients fulfilling the POSEIDON group 4 criteria."

We aimed to investigate maternal and paternal smoking onset in specific time windows in relation to offspring body mass index (BMI) and fat mass index (FMI). We investigated fathers (n = 2111) and mothers (n = 2569) aged 39-65 years, of the population based RHINE and ECRHS studies, and their offspring aged 18-49 years (n = 6487, mean age 29.6 years) who participated in the RHINESSA study. BMI was calculated from self-reported height and weight, and FMI was estimated from bioelectrical impedance measures in a subsample. Associations with parental smoking were analysed with generalized linear regression adjusting for parental education and clustering by study centre and family. Interactions between offspring sex were analysed, as was mediation by parental pack years, parental BMI, offspring smoking and offspring birthweight. Fathers' smoking onset before conception of the offspring (onset ≥15 years) was associated with higher BMI in the offspring when adult (β 0.551, 95%CI: 0.174-0.929, p = 0.004). Mothers' preconception and postnatal smoking onset was associated with higher offspring BMI (onset <15 years: β1.161, 95%CI 0.378-1.944; onset ≥15 years: β0.720, 95%CI 0.293-1.147; onset after offspring birth: β2.257, 95%CI 1.220-3.294). However, mediation analysis indicated that these effects were fully mediated by parents' postnatal pack years, and partially mediated by parents' BMI and offspring smoking. Regarding FMI, sons of smoking fathers also had higher fat mass (onset <15 years β1.604, 95%CI 0.269-2.939; onset ≥15 years β2.590, 95%CI 0.544-4.636; and onset after birth β2.736, 95%CI 0.621-4.851). There was no association between maternal smoking and offspring fat mass. We found that parents' smoking before conception was associated with higher BMI in offspring when they reached adulthood, but that these effects were mediated through parents' pack years, suggesting that cumulative smoking exposure during offspring's childhood may elicit long lasting effects on offspring BMI."

It is well described that the Th17 cell population increases in patients with early Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), which correlates with the disease activity. Here, we investigated the role of NLRP12 in the differentiation of Th17 cells and the development of experimental arthritis, using the antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) murine model. We found that Nlrp12-/ - mice develop severe arthritis characterized by an exacerbated Th17-mediated inflammatory response with increases in the articular hyperalgesia, knee joint swelling, and neutrophil infiltration. Adoptive transfer of Nlrp12-/ - cells into WT mice recapitulated the hyperinflammatory response seen in Nlrp12-/ - mice and the treatment with anti-IL-17A neutralizing antibody abrogated arthritis development in Nlrp12-/ - mice, suggesting that NLRP12 works as an inhibitor of Th17 cell differentiation. Indeed, Th17 cell differentiation markedly increases in Nlrp12-/- T cells cultured under the Th17-skewing condition. Mechanistically, we found that NLRP12 negatively regulates IL-6-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 in T cells. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 reduced Th17 cell differentiation and abrogated hyperinflammatory arthritis observed in Nlrp12-/ - mice. Thus, we described a novel role for NLRP12 as a checkpoint inhibitor of Th17 cell differentiation, which controls the severity of experimental arthritis."

Previously, no transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) cutoffs have been published. We sought to evaluate (1) the feasibility to image the pulmonary trunk in a prospective cohort, and (2) the ability of PA:A derived by TTE to predict pulmonary hypertension (PH). Methods We performed a post-hoc analysis of a prospectively recruited consecutive cohort of patients referred to our tertiary center cardiology department due to suspicion for PH. Invasive hemodynamic assessment and quasi-simultaneous TTE was performed in all participants. Results A total of 84 patients were included in the analysis, median age was 70.5 years (IQR 58–75), 46 (55%) were female. The PA was significantly wider in the PH group (28mm vs. 22.5mm, p<0.001) with a resulting median PA:A of 0.84 vs. 0.66 (p<0.001). Both PA diameter (r = 0.524 and r = 0.44, both p<0.001) and PA:A (r = 0.652 and 0.697, both p<0.001) significantly correlated with mPAP and with PVR, respectively. Area under the curve for the detection of PH was 0.853 (95%CI 0.739–0.967, p<0.001). Conclusion The PA can be visualized in almost all echocardiographic exams, especially when it is dilated. A view showing the pulmonary trunk should be included in every routine TTE. An increased PA:A should raise suspicion for PH and prompt further evaluation and follow-up examinations of these patients."

Next-generation sequencing of clinically heterogeneous cohorts (children with either a suspected genetic disorder or a congenital microcephaly) recently identified mutations in this gene, illustrating how profoundly these technologies are modifying genetic testing and assessment. As RNU4ATAC has a single non-coding exon, the bioinformatic prediction algorithms assessing the effect of sequence variants on splicing or protein function are irrelevant, which makes variant interpretation challenging to molecular diagnostic laboratories. In order to facilitate and improve clinical diagnostic assessment and genetic counseling, we present i) an update of the previously reported RNU4ATAC mutations and an analysis of the genetic variations affecting this gene using the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) resource; ii) the pathogenicity prediction performances of scores computed based on an RNA structure prediction tool and of those produced by the Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion tool for the 285 RNU4ATAC variants identified in patients or in large-scale sequencing projects; iii) a method, based on a cellular assay, that allows to measure the effect of RNU4ATAC variants on splicing efficiency of a minor (U12-type) reporter intron.

The highly effective nature of XTH43 overexpression in suppressing H. glycines parasitism in soybean has led to experiments examining whether the heterologous expression of XTH43 in Gossypium hirsutum (upland cotton) could impair the parasitism of Meloidogyne incognita, that form a different type of nurse cell called a giant cell that is enclosed within a swollen root structure called a gall. The heterologous transgenic expression of XTH43 in cotton resulted in an 18% decrease in the number of galls, 70% decrease in egg masses, 64% decrease in egg production and a 97% decrease in second stage juvenile (J2) production as compared to transgenic controls. The heterologous XTH43 expression does not significantly affect root mass. The results demonstrate XTH43 expression functions effectively in impairing the development of M. incognita at numerous life cycle stages occurring within the cotton root. The experiments reveal that there are highly conserved aspects of the defense response of G. max that can function effectively in G. hirsutum to impair M. incognita having a different method of parasitism."

https://openalex.org/W3038885387,"In several phytophagous hemipterans, behavior appears to be mediated by both visual and chemical cues. For the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera: Liviidae), olfactometric assays are generally difficult to interpret owing to the low proportion of individuals responding to odors (~30–40%), which compromises the efficiency and reliability of the results of behavioral tests. In the present study, the ACP behavioral response to emitted odors from sweet orange (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) flushes in a 4-arm olfactometer using different colors (four white-, two white- and two yellow- on opposite sides, or four yellow-colored fields), and the role of the airflow in the concentration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were assessed at two airflows [0.4 and 0.1 L/min (LPM)]. Exposure to ‘Pera’ sweet orange or clean air in treatments with four yellow-colored-fields increased the response rate of ACP females to the odor sources compared with exposure to ‘Pera’ sweet orange or clean air in treatments with four white-colored-fields, independently of the odor source and airflow tested. For the assays using two white- and two yellow-colored fields on opposite sides and 0.4 or 0.1 LPM airflow, the residence time of ACP females to odors (‘Pera’ sweet orange or clean air) was similar or higher in treatments using yellow- than those using white-colored fields. For both assays (VOCs and olfactometric behavioral parameters), the reduction in airflow from 0.4 to 0.1 LPM greatly changed the airborne concentration and ACP behavior. Quantitative chemical analyses revelead that the concentration of most compounds emitted by ‘Pera’ sweet orange flushes for the headspace using 0.1 LPM airflow were greater than the concentrations measured using 0.4 LPM airflow. Therefore, this treatment design provides an useful tool to assess the ACP behavioral response to the odors from citrus plants, and it can also help in the discrimination of dose-response screenings for VOCs or conspecific insects."
https://openalex.org/W3039164147,"The medulloblastoma (MB) microenvironment is diverse, and cell-cell interactions within this milieu is of prime importance. Astrocytes, a major component of the microenvironment, have been shown to impact primary tumor cell phenotypes and metastasis. Based on proximity of MB cells and astrocytes in the brain microenvironment, we investigated whether astrocytes may influence MB cell phenotypes directly. Astrocyte conditioned media (ACM) increased Daoy MB cell invasion, adhesion, and in vivo cellular protrusion formation. ACM conditioning of MB cells also increased CD133 surface expression, a key cancer stem cell marker of MB. Additional neural stem cell markers, Nestin and Oct-4A, were also increased by ACM conditioning, as well as neurosphere formation. By knocking down CD133 using short interfering RNA (siRNA), we showed that ACM upregulated CD133 expression in MB plays an important role in invasion, adhesion and neurosphere formation. Collectively, our data suggests that astrocytes influence MB cell phenotypes by regulating CD133 expression, a key protein with defined roles in MB tumorgenicity and survival."
https://openalex.org/W3040295215,"As new combinations of interventions aiming at interrupting malaria transmission are under evaluation, understanding the associated economic costs and benefits is critical for decision-making. This study assessed the economic cost and cost-effectiveness of the Magude project, a malaria elimination initiative implemented in a district in southern Mozambique (i.e. Magude) between August 2015-June 2018. This project piloted a combination of two mass drug administration (MDA) rounds per year for two consecutive years, annual rounds of universal indoor residual spraying (IRS) and a strengthened surveillance and response system on the back of universal long-lasting insecticide treated net (LLIN) coverage and routine case management implemented by the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP). Although local transmission was not interrupted, the project achieved large reductions in the burden of malaria in the target district.We collected weekly economic data, estimated costs from the project implementer perspective and assessed the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) associated with the Magude project as compared to routine malaria control activities, the counterfactual. We estimated disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for malaria cases and deaths and assessed the variation of the ICER over time to capture the marginal costs and effectiveness associated with subsequent phases of project implementation. We used deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty and built an alternative scenario by assuming the implementation of the interventions from a governmental perspective. Economic costs are provided in constant US$2015.After three years, the Magude project averted a total of 3,171 DALYs at an incremental cost of $2.89 million and an average yearly cost of $20.7 per targeted person. At an average cost of $19.4 per person treated per MDA round, the social mobilization and distribution of door-to-door MDA contributed to 53% of overall resources employed, with personnel and logistics being the main cost drivers. The ICER improved over time as a result of decreasing costs and improved effectiveness. The overall ICER was $987 (CI95% 968-1,006) per DALY averted, which is below the standard cost-effectiveness (CE) threshold of $1,404/DALY averted, three times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of Mozambique, but above the threshold of interventions considered highly cost-effective (one time the GDP per capita or $468/DALY averted) and above the recently suggested thresholds based on the health opportunity cost ($537 purchasing power parity/ DALY averted). A significantly lower ICER was obtained in the implementation scenario from a governmental perspective ($441/DALY averted).Despite the initial high costs and volume of resources associated with its implementation, MDA in combination with other existing malaria control interventions, can be a cost-effective strategy to drastically reduce transmission in areas of low to moderate transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. However, further studies are needed to understand the capacity of the health system and financial affordability to scale up such strategies at regional or national level."
https://openalex.org/W3038158277,"FOXC1 is a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors, and whose function is poorly understood. A variety of FOXC1 mutants have been identified in patients diagnosed with the autosomal dominant disease Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, which is mainly characterized by abnormal development of the eyes, particularly those who also have accompanying congenital heart defects (CHD). However, the role of FOXC1 in CHD, and how these mutations might impact FOXC1 function, remains elusive. Our previous work provided one clue to possible function, demonstrating that zebrafish foxc1a, an orthologue of human FOXC1 essential for heart development, directly regulates the expression of nkx2.5, encoding a transcriptional regulator of cardiac progenitor cells. Abnormal expression of Nkx2-5 leads to CHD in mice and is also associated with CHD patients. Whether this link extends to the human system, however, requires investigation. In this study, we demonstrate that FOXC1 does regulate human NKX2-5 expression in a dose-dependent manner via direct binding to its proximal promoter. A comparison of FOXC1 mutant function in the rat cardiac cell line H9c2 and zebrafish embryos suggested that the zebrafish embryos might serve as a more representative model system than the H9c2 cells. Finally, we noted that three of the Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome FOXC1 mutations tested increased, whereas a fourth repressed the expression of NKX2-5. These results imply that mutant FOXC1s might play etiological roles in CHD by abnormally regulating NKX2-5 in the patients. And zebrafish embryos can serve as a useful in vivo platform for rapidly evaluating disease-causing roles of mutated genes."
https://openalex.org/W3040520916,"To assess the feasibility and technical success of endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) of recurrent varicose veins arising from the former sapheno-femoral junction (SFJ).We retrospectively analyzed all EVLA procedures treated in our institution by one surgeon between March 2019 and April 2020 and selected all consecutive cases with SFJ recurrence occuring after surgical high ligation and stripping or endovenous thermal ablation for incompetence of the great saphenous vein (GSV) in superficial venous insufficiency. The feasibility, technical success as determined by duplex ultrasound on the postoperative visit, complications and rate of endothermal heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT) were recorded. A subgroup definition was performed based on sonographic morphology of the recurrence and resulting strategy of ablation.Thirty-five limbs with SFJ recurrence in 34 patients were treated with EVLA in order to shut down the highest refluxing point. In 22 interventions, it was required to switch off a short stump or a neovascularization by direct puncture (Subgroup 1). In 13 treatments, the presence of residual GSV segments, or persistent, varicose transformed major tributaries like the anterior accessory great saphenous vein, enabled cannulation and advancing the laser fiber from distal to the former SFJ (Subgroup 2). The EVLA procedures could be successfully carried out in all 35 cases. There were no major complications, no thromboembolism or EHIT, and no local groin complications. In one case, the patient developed a phlebitic response that required temporary medication. Technical success was achieved with 34/35 treatments (97.1%). When comparing the subgroups, the morphological pattern of the SFJ recurrence and the resulting technique of puncture, cannulation and ablation did not influence the result.The results of this case series suggest that SFJ recurrences can also be successfully treated in situations where there are tortuous or short stumps that require direct puncture and ablation."
https://openalex.org/W3040348916,"Objective This study aimed to define the prevalence and predictors of non-right-handedness and its link to long-term neurodevelopmental outcome and early neuroimaging in a cohort of children born extremely preterm (<28 weeks gestation). Methods 179 children born extremely preterm admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of our tertiary centre from 2006–2013 were included in a prospective longitudinal cohort study. Collected data included perinatal data, demographic characteristics, neurodevelopmental outcome measured by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development at 2 years and the Movement Assessment Battery for Children at 5 years, and handedness measured at school age (4–8 years). Magnetic resonance imaging performed at term-equivalent age was used to study overt brain injury. Diffusion tensor imaging scans were analysed using tract-based spatial statistics to assess white matter microstructure in relation to handedness and neurodevelopmental outcome. Results The prevalence of non-right-handedness in our cohort was 22.9%, compared to 12% in the general population. Weaker fine motor skills at 2 years and paternal non-right-handedness were significantly associated with non-right-handedness. Both overt brain injury and fractional anisotropy of white matter structures on diffusion tensor images were not related to handedness. Fractional anisotropy measurements showed significant associations with neurodevelopmental outcome. Conclusions Our data show that non-right-handedness in children born extremely preterm occurs almost twice as frequently as in the general population. In the studied population, non-right-handedness is associated with weaker fine motor skills and paternal non-right-handedness, but not with overt brain injury or microstructural brain development on early magnetic resonance imaging."
https://openalex.org/W3040374667,"Insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2, along with IRS-1, is a key signaling molecule that mediates the action of insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I. The activated insulin and IGF-I receptors phosphorylate IRSs on tyrosine residues, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways and the induction of various physiological functions of insulin and IGF-I. Studies using IRS-2 knockout (KO) mice showed that the deletion of IRS-2 causes type 2 diabetes due to peripheral insulin resistance and impaired β-cell function. However, little is known about the roles of IRS-2 in other animal models. Here, we created IRS-2 KO rats to elucidate the physiological functions of IRS-2 in rats. The body weights of IRS-2 KO rats at birth were lower compared with those of their WT littermates. The postnatal growth of both male and female IRS-2 KO rats was also suppressed. Compared with male WT rats, the glucose and insulin tolerance of male IRS-2 KO rats were slightly enhanced, whereas a similar difference was not observed between female WT and IRS-2 KO rats. Besides the modestly increased insulin sensitivity, male IRS-2 KO rats displayed the enhanced insulin-induced activation of the mTOR complex 1 pathway in the liver compared with WT rats. Taken together, these results indicate that in rats, IRS-2 plays important roles in the regulation of growth but is not essential for the glucose-lowering effects of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W3038323629,"Purpose To investigate the incidence of corneal transplantation and identify rates and risk factors of repeated corneal transplantation in South Korea. Methods This is a retrospective population-based cohort study using the Korean National Health Insurance System database. Among the entire South Korean population (N = 51,827,813), we included those who underwent corneal transplantation more than once between January 2006 and December 2016, and analyzed the annual incidence of keratoplasty. The person-year incidence of repeated keratoplasty after the first operation was calculated according to risk factors including age group, sex, income level, surgical method, surgical etiology, and presence of major systemic diseases. Cox regression analysis was employed to evaluate the hazard ratios of those risk factors on repeated keratoplasty. Results A total of 9,452 cases of corneal transplantation occurred from January 2006 to December 2016. The average annual incidence of corneal transplantations was 1.694 per 100,000. The proportion of penetrating keratoplasty steadily decreased from 92.22% in 2006 to 77.81% in 2016. The average incidence of repeated keratoplasty among those who underwent corneal transplantation at least once was 43.24 per 1,000 person-years. Males had a greater incidence of repeated keratoplasty compared to females (males: 47.66 per 1,000, females: 36.04 per 1,000). The age group from 20 to 39 years demonstrated the lowest incidence of repeated keratoplasty at 24.94 per 1,000. Keratoconus had the lowest incidence of repeated keratoplasty (22.82 per 1,000). Conclusion This study may provide a better understanding of corneal diseases, help predict disease burden, and plan health care systems accordingly in South Korea."

https://openalex.org/W3039652295,"Peptic ulcer is a widespread disease, frequently complicated by perforation and bleeding. Administrative databases are useful tool to perform epidemiological and drug utilization studies, but they need a validation process based on a comparison with the original data contained in the medical charts. Our aim was to evaluate the accuracy of the ICD-9 codes in identifying patients with peptic ulcer and gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the regional administrative database of Umbria.The index test of our study was the hospital discharge abstract database of the Umbria region (Italy), while the reference standard was the clinical information collected in the medical charts. The study population were adult patients with a hospital discharge for peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the period 2012-2014. A random sample of cases and non-cases was selected and the corresponding medical charts were reviewed. Cases of peptic ulcer were confirmed based on endoscopy, radiology, and surgery, while adjudication of gastrointestinal hemorrhage was based on presence of hematemesis, melena, and rectal bleeding.Overall, we reviewed 445 clinical charts of cases and 80 clinical charts of non-cases. The diagnostic accuracy results were: code 531 (gastric ulcer), sensitivity and NPV 98%, specificity 88%, and PPV 91%; code 532 (duodenal ulcer), sensitivity and NPV 100%, specificity and PPV 98%; code 534 (gastrojejunal ulcer), sensitivity and NPV 100%, specificity 70%, and PPV 45%; code 578 (gastrointestinal hemorrhage), sensitivity 96%, specificity 90%, PPV and NPV 94%.Our results showed a high level of diagnostic accuracy for most of the codes considered. The ICD-9 code 534 of gastrojejunal ulcer had a lower level of specificity and PPV due to false positives, being mainly misclassifications for coding errors. These validated codes can be used for future epidemiological studies and for health services research."
https://openalex.org/W3040475031,"Guidelines recommend venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in hospitalized medical patients with Padua prediction score (PPS) ≥4 points. This recommendation is based on the high risk of symptomatic VTE observed among these patients in the Italian PPS derivation study, and the fivefold risk reduction with VTE-prophylaxis. This study aims to assess the incidence of VTE in high risk medical patients in a medium sized hospital in Israel.In this retrospective cohort study, data was collected of all medical patients hospitalized between January and June 2014. Patients were classified into low and high risk groups according to their PPS score, and according to whether they received anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis for VTE. Patients were further randomly selected to compare high risk patients that did or did not receive anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. We further compared VTE incidence in high and low risk patients not treated with thromboprophylaxis. A search was conducted for diagnoses of venous thromboembolism and death during hospitalization and the following 90 days.568 high risk patients (PPS ≥4 points) were included, 284 treated with prophylactic anticoagulation and 284 not. There were no VTE events in either group. There was no difference in mortality. A total of 642 non anticoagulated patients were randomly selected, 474 low risk and 168 high risk. There were no VTE events in either group.The risk of VTE appears to be very low in our study, suggesting that among medical patients with PPS ≥4, the risk of VTE may differ dramatically between populations."
https://openalex.org/W3038644376,"To estimate the pooled prevalence and incidence of suicidal ideation, attempts, and deaths in people with sleep apnea.We will identify epidemiological studies reporting the prevalence or incidence rate of suicide in people with sleep apnea. We will search the following databases: PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, Cochrane Library, OVID (HEALTH STAR), OVID (MEDLINE) and Joana Briggs Institute EBF Database. No age, geographical location, study-design or language limits will be applied. This protocol was developed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. Two reviewers (YY and YP) will independently screen citations, abstracts and will identify full-text articles for inclusion, extract data, and appraise the quality and bias of included studies. Discrepancies will be resolved by consulting with a third researcher (MC). Study quality will be assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The primary outcomes will be the overall prevalence or incidence of suicidal ideation, attempts and completion and the risk of suicide in people with sleep apnea. For pooling of the studies, we will use a random-effects model with a logit transformation. The DerSimonian and Laird (DL) random-effects method will be used to estimate the pooled inter-study variance. We will assess the between-study heterogeneity using I2 statistics, and Cochrane's Q statistic (significance level < 0.05). If the I2 is high (>75%), we will perform subgroup meta-analyses and conduct a meta-regression analysis to explore sources of study heterogeneity using study level median age, study-level proportions of race, gender, depression and quality scores. We will report effect estimates as suicide risk per 1000 individuals. Egger's test and funnel plots will be used to assess publication bias, and adjusted estimates using trim and fill methods will be reported if publication bias is suspected.No ethics clearance is required as no primary data will be collected. The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis will be presented at scientific conferences and published in a peer-review journal. The results may shed more light on the burden of suicide risk among individuals with sleep apnea and may guide future population-specific interventions.PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020165404."
