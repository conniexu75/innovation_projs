https://openalex.org/W2007362831,"The monoclonal antibody KJ23a reacts with T cell receptors utilizing the V beta segment V beta 17a. T cells bearing V beta 17a+ receptors react with very high frequency with the MHC class II protein, IE. In this paper we show that T cells expressing V beta 17a are selectively eliminated from the peripheral T cell and mature thymocyte pool of mice expressing IE, but are present in expected numbers in the immature thymocyte population of such animals. These results show that in normal animals tolerance to self-MHC is due to clonal elimination rather than suppression. In addition, they indicate that tolerance induction may occur in the thymus at the time immature thymocytes are selected to move into the mature thymocyte pool."

https://openalex.org/W1513452394,"We examined the effects of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) on the production of collagen by cultures of human embryonic lung fibroblasts. TGF-beta at 0.1 ng/ml appeared to activate selectively extracellular collagen accumulation as compared with total protein production. A maximal effect inducing a 2-3-fold increase in collagen and total protein production occurred at a dose of 1.0 ng/ml in fibroblast cultures. TGF-beta had no effect on fibroblast proliferation after a 24- and 48-h exposure, including cultures that received a second dose after 24 h. Collagenase digestion of radiolabeled collagen derived from TGF-beta-treated and -untreated cultures revealed no differences in the extent of hydroxylation (37.3 versus 33.4%). TGF-beta increased the production of types I and III collagen without affecting the proportion of collagen types. Fibroblast cultures maintained in medium containing TGF-beta sustained an activated rate of collagen production of 5 nmol/ml/24 h over at least 72 h. We found that epidermal growth factor slightly enhanced TGF-beta-induced collagen formation, whereas TGF-beta increased the proliferative effect of epidermal growth factor. Taken together, these data indicate that collagen production and cell proliferation can be independently regulated and that TGF-beta may have a role in the resolution of tissue injury by stimulating fibroblast-derived collagen synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2025732397,"A 4-kilobase complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding human macrophage-specific colony-stimulating factor (CSF-1) was isolated. When introduced into mammalian cells, this cDNA directs the expression of CSF-1 that is structurally and functionally indistinguishable from the natural human urinary CSF-1. Direct structural analysis of both the recombinant CSF-1 and the purified human urinary protein revealed that these species contain a sequence of at least 40 amino acids at their carboxyl termini which are not found in the coding region of a 1.6-kilobase CSF-1 cDNA that was previously described. These results demonstrate that the human CSF-1 gene can be expressed to yield at least two different messenger RNA species that encode distinct but related forms of CSF-1."
https://openalex.org/W2095549623,"Epidermal regeneration following middermal injuries to skin requires both proliferation and migration of keratinocytes. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates the proliferation of keratinocytes in culture, and topical administration of EGF accelerates epidermal regeneration of partial thickness burns or split-thickness incisions in vivo. Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-α) and vaccinia growth factor (VGF) have substantial sequence homology with EGF, and all appear to bind to the same receptor protein. Whether TGF-α or VGF can affect epidermal wound healing in vivo is not known. The present studies show that topical administration of TGF-α or VGF in antibiotic cream to partial thickness burns (second degree) accelerated epidermal regeneration in comparison with untreated or vehicle-treated burns. Low levels of both TGF-α and VGF (0.1 microgram per milliliter) appeared to be more effective than EGF in stimulating epidermal regeneration. Regenerated epithelium from burns treated with TGF-α or VGF appeared normal histologically. This finding suggests that topical application of selected growth factors may be useful in accelerating healing of partial thickness injuries."
https://openalex.org/W2048024207,"One characteristic of the immune response during hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in humans is the vigorous production and subsequent persistence of antibodies of immunoglobulin (Ig) classes M and G to the nucleocapsid antigen (HBcAg). In this study HBcAg was shown to be similarly immunogenic in mice. When injected into athymic (nude) B10.BR and athymic BALB/c mice, HBcAg induced IgM and IgG class antibodies to HBc in spite of the absence of T cells in nude mice. In euthymic mice, HBcAg efficiently stimulated T-cell proliferation in vitro and helper T-cell function in vivo. The dual functions of HBcAg as a T-cell-independent and a T-cell-dependent antigen may explain its enhanced immunogenicity. Denaturation of HBcAg yields a nonparticulate antigen designated HBeAg; when HBeAg was used as the immunogen, antibody production required helper T-cell function. Although HBcAg and HBeAg are serologically distinct, they are structurally related, and in these experiments were highly cross-reactive at the T-cell level. These results suggest that the elevated levels of IgM antibodies to HBc and the enhanced immunogenicity of HBcAg during HBV infection in humans reflect the ability of HBcAg to directly activate B cells to produce antibodies to HBc in the presence or absence of HBcAg- or HBeAg-sensitized T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2089155355,"Sequences encoding immunoglobulin variable domains are known to be assembled from variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments by site-specific recombination. We present a sensitive and rapid assay for V-(D)-J recombination that uses plasmid DNA transiently introduced into transformed pre-B cells, and demonstrates that the recombination is independent of any unique chromosomal context. Sequences sufficient to constitute recombination sites are contained within the 84 and 42 bp flanking, respectively, the murine J kappa 1 and V kappa L8 segments, which include the known heptamer-nonamer V-(D)-J joining signals. Deletion and inversion occur at comparable frequencies. Thus, V-(D)-J recombination may be relatively insensitive to the topological arrangement of sites, and events at the two novel junctions produced by the reaction may be coupled."
https://openalex.org/W1993641339,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) inhibits the growth of endothelial cells derived from various sources, including human umbilical vein, bovine aorta, and rat heart. Long-term exposure of rat heart endothelial cells to TGF-beta also induces dramatic changes in morphology that are characteristic of senescent cells. These changes are accompanied by a decrease in the number of high-affinity receptors for epidermal growth factor (EGF), with almost no change in total receptor number. Additionally, the EGF-induced expression of specific competence genes (c-myc, JE, KC) is decreased, whereas the induction of c-fos gene expression by EGF is unaltered by TGF-beta treatment. These data suggest that growth inhibitors such as TGF-beta may act by altering the cell's response to growth-stimulatory factors."

https://openalex.org/W2074242250,"Bone marrow stromal cell lines have been isolated that directly support B lymphopoiesis in vitro. Single B-lineage precursors proliferate and differentiate on certain of these stromal cell lines to establish long-term B-lineage cultures. These lymphopoietic stromal cells produce novel soluble factors that support proliferation of in vitro established pre-B cell populations. Lymphoid populations established on lymphopoietic stromal cell lines lack surface Ig-bearing cells, but give rise to surface Ig+ cells when transferred to mixed bone marrow feeder layers. Several stromal lines expressed a B-lineage neoplasia marker detected by the monoclonal antibody MAb6C3. Remarkably, only the 6C3Aghi stromal lines supported long-term proliferation of B-lineage cells. We propose that the 6C3 antigen-bearing molecule may play a role in stromal cell-dependent, pre-B cell proliferation, as well as in neoplastic proliferation of pre-B leukemias."

https://openalex.org/W2010130789,"Clonal progeny of naive B cells (producing a primary antibody response) and of memory B cells (producing a secondary response) were identified in a cell transfer system. Primary response clones are typically derived from IgM precursors and express unmutated V regions. Multiple isotype switches occur in these clones. Secondary response clones derive from IgG1 precursors and express highly mutated V regions. Additional switches do not occur. With one exception, there was no evidence for somatic mutation during clonal expansion. The generation of mutated memory cells may thus represent a distinct differentiation pathway. Evidence is presented that, in this pathway, mutants that have lost antigen binding specificity but that remain available for stimulation by a different antigen arise upon antigenic stimulation."

Mouse embryo cells established and maintained for multiple passages in the absence of serum did not exhibit growth crisis or gross chromosomal aberration. Cells cultured under these conditions were dependent on epidermal growth factor for survival. Proliferation was reversibly inhibited by serum or platelet-free plasma, suggesting that mouse embryo cultures maintained by conventional procedures are under the influence of inhibitory factors."
https://openalex.org/W2005631749,"The properties of the viral and cellular fos proteins (Fos) were investigated as a first step toward understanding the function of the fos gene. Treatment of nuclei with salt and nonionic detergents solubilized a complex that contained Fos together with several other cellular proteins. The majority of the Fos protein complex was released from isolated nuclei incubated in the presence of deoxyribonuclease I or micrococcal nuclease but not with ribonuclease A, suggesting that Fos is associated with chromatin. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that Fos protein from native or denatured nuclear extracts exhibited DNA-binding activity in vitro. These results suggest that Fos is involved in the regulation of gene expression."

We have employed radiolabeled, photoactivatable aryl azide derivatives of the two sequences to explore the relationship between the binding sites for these peptides on the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex. Each probe specifically labeled only the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex of intact platelets. Since each peptide inhibited labeling of the receptor complex by the other, the peptides compete for binding sites on the receptor complex. However, the binding sites do not appear to be identical. Whereas the RGDS probe specifically labeled both glycoproteins IIb and IIIa, the HHLGGAKQA-GDV probe specifically labeled only glycoprotein IIb."
https://openalex.org/W1490734926,"Multiple kinases interact at the multicomponent murine T cell antigen receptor. Antigen induces serine phosphorylation of the 21-kDa gamma glycoprotein and tyrosine phosphorylation of p21, a distinct 21-kDa chain. We demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation is due to kinase activation, and that all phosphorylated p21 is associated with the antigen receptor. We also show that antigen leads to polyphosphoinositide metabolism and subsequent protein kinase C activation. The two phosphorylation events can be dissociated by protein kinase C depletion, which eliminates phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced serine but not tyrosine phosphorylation. Activation of a third kinase, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, inhibits both serine and tyrosine events, yet this inhibition can be modulated by addition of the protein kinase C activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Receptor-mediated signal transduction may be understood as the interaction of multiple stimulatory and inhibitory kinase activities."
https://openalex.org/W1965164352,"Short cis-active sequences of the rat prolactin or Moloney murine leukemia virus genes transfer transcriptional regulation by both epidermal growth factor and phorbol esters to fusion genes. These sequences act in a position- and orientation-independent manner. Competitive binding analyses with nuclear extracts from stimulated and unstimulated cells suggest that different trans-acting factors associate with the regulatory sequence of each gene. A model is proposed suggesting that both epidermal growth factor and phorbol esters stimulate the transcription of responsive genes via discrete classes of hormone-dependent, enhancer-like elements that bind different trans-acting factors, even in the absence of hormone stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1530978561,"The ferritin family is a widespread group of proteins that maintain iron in a soluble form and also protect against the toxic effects of excess iron. The structure and sequence of the proteins are highly conserved. However, the cell-specific features of structure which occur within the same organism indicate cell specificity of gene expression and may be related to variations in types of iron storage, i.e. specialized-cell ferritin (stored iron is for other cell types) versus housekeeping ferritin (stored iron is for intracellular purposes related to normal or stress metabolism); the protein structure may also affect rates of iron turnover. Iron induces ferritin synthesis and accumulation by recruiting stored ferritin mRNA that is efficiently translated in cells specialized for iron storage. For the first time we show the occurrence of three different cDNAs from bullfrog tadpoles, corresponding to three subunits of the protein: H, M, and L. Thus, ferritin can be encoded by at least three different mRNAs and probably three different genes, in contrast to the older idea of two, H and L; the subunits maintain the conserved sequences of known ferritins and have similar predicted masses, 20.5, 20.6, and 19.9 kDa, but have distinct mobilities in denaturing gels. Ferritin subunit expression is cell specific; more of the H and L chain mRNAs are expressed in red cells than in liver. Ferritin expression is regulated by transcription (or mRNA stability) in adult red cells; cellular levels of ferritin mRNA were 20% that of embryonic red cells, and L subunit mRNA increased 2.5 times with excess iron. Ferritin expression is also regulated during translation in adult red cells; iron recruits stored ferritin mRNA, but only during certain stages of red cell maturation, in contrast to embryonic red cells. The developmental differences in ferritin expression are discussed in relation to the shift from specialized-cell ferritin to housekeeping ferritin in red cells of the embryonic versus adult lines."
https://openalex.org/W1520486961,"Differentiation of pulmonary Type II epithelial cells in late gestation is associated with the synthesis of pulmonary surfactant required for adaptation to air breathing at birth. In the present work, induction of synthesis of a Type II epithelial cell protein, surfactant-associated glycoprotein of Mr = 35,000 (SAP-35) was studied in human fetal lung tissue obtained at 15-24 weeks of gestation. SAP-35 content increased during organ culture in the absence of exogenous hormones. Epidermal growth factor or triiodothyronine stimulated the induction of SAP-35 synthesis during culture. Stimulation by epidermal growth factor (EGF) was detected as early as 2 days and persisted for up to 5 days in culture. Response to EGF was dose-dependent (0.01-10 ng/ml) and was associated with enhanced incorporation of [35S]methionine into immunoprecipitable SAP-35. Increased SAP-35 synthesis was associated with increased SAP-35 RNA as assessed by Northern blot and hybridization assays with human SAP-35 cDNA. Effects of EGF were comparable to the induction of SAP-35 synthesis by 8-bromo-cAMP. In contrast to the stimulatory effect of EGF and triiodothyronine, SAP-35 content was inhibited by transforming growth factor-beta. Both the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of these agents on SAP-35 content were associated with concomitant changes in SAP-35 synthesis. These findings demonstrate multihormonal control of SAP-35 expression and strongly implicate both EGF and transforming growth factor-beta in the regulation of surfactant apoprotein synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2044863269,"Alternative RNA processing of the calcitonin/CGRP gene generates transcripts encoding predominantly calcitonin in thyroid C cells or CGRP in the nervous system. To examine the RNA processing choice of this gene in a wide variety of tissues, we created transgenic mice expressing the rat calcitonin/CGRP transcript from the mouse metallothionein-I promoter. Most cells that do not express the endogenous calcitonin/CGRP gene have the capability to make a clear splicing choice for calcitonin or CGRP transcript. In the majority of tissues studied, 90%-97% of the transgene mRNA encodes calcitonin. In contrast, both calcitonin and CGRP mRNAs were detected in the transgenic mice brains. Immunohistochemical and in situ RNA hybridization analyses show that CGRP transcripts are selectively expressed in a wide variety of neurons, while calcitonin is expressed predominantly in nonneuronal structures. Splicing choice operates independently of calcitonin/CGRP gene transcription. The data suggest that a specific regulatory machinery is required for the processing of CGRP transcripts and is restricted primarily to neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1966393356,"The mammalian Y chromosome encodes a testis-determining factor (termed TDF in the human), a master regulator of sex differentiation. Embryos with a Y chromosome develop testes and become males whereas embryos lacking a Y chromosome develop ovaries and become females. Expression of H-Y, a minor histocompatibility antigen, may also be controlled by a gene on the Y chromosome, and it has been proposed that this antigen is the testis-determining factor. We have tested the postulated identity of H-Y and TDF in the human. H-Y typing with T cells was carried out on a series of sex-reversed humans (XX males and XY females), each shown by DNA hybridization to carry part but not all of the Y chromosome. This deletion analysis maps the gene for H-Y to the long arm or centromeric region of the human Y chromosome, far from the TDF locus, which maps to the distal short arm."
https://openalex.org/W2016323743,"A direct measurement of the avidity of the junction between a cytotoxic T lymphocyte and its target cell was achieved by using a biophysical approach. A micromanipulation technique was used to determine the force required to separate a cytotoxic T cell (human clone F1, with specificity for HLA-DRw6) from its specific target cell (JY: HLA-A2, -B7, -DR4, w6) prior to delivery of the lethal hit. The force required to separate the F1-JY pair is 1.5 × 104 dynes per square centimeter. This junction avidity for F1-JY pairs is 6 to 13 times greater than that for F1-F1 and JY-JY pairs; the F1-JY conjugate requires a stronger separating force and is more easily rejoined than the homologous cell pairs. This study provides an estimate of the avidity of cytotoxic T cells for their target cells and insights into the biophysical correlates of the molecular complexes formed in the interaction of cytotoxic T cells and their targets during the cytotoxic process."
https://openalex.org/W1568191878,"Polypeptide growth factors that stimulate cell proliferation bind to cell surface receptors and activate intracellular signal transduction pathways. One major signalling pathway, initiated by phosphatidylinositol (PI) turnover, involves activation of protein kinase C. Some polypeptide growth factors, including mitogens that activate protein kinase C, induce a rapid increase in expression of the proto-oncogenes, c-myc and c-fos. In order to characterize the signal transduction pathways responsible for proto-oncogene activation, we treated Swiss 3T3 cells with the tumor promoter phorbol dibutyrate to generate cells deficient in protein kinase C. These cells were then stimulated with platelet extract, bombesin, or epidermal growth factor (EGF) and the levels of c-myc and c-fos mRNA were determined. Platelet extract or bombesin, which stimulate PI turnover, were substantially weaker inducers of c-myc and c-fos mRNA levels in the protein kinase C-depleted cells, although some variability with platelet extract was noted. EGF, which does not stimulate PI turnover in several cell systems, was by contrast a potent inducer of both proto-oncogenes whether or not the cells were deficient in protein kinase C. Pretreatment of cells with phorbol dibutyrate caused little or no change in the basal levels of c-myc or c-fos mRNA, but led to a small but significant increase in basal levels of ornithine decarboxylase mRNA. These results demonstrate that EGF and growth factors that activate PI turnover induce expression of the c-myc and c-fos proto-oncogenes through different pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1538164176,"We compared the abilities of the muscarinic agonist carbachol, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to induce proto-oncogene mRNA accumulation and other cellular responses in normal and protein kinase C-deficient 1321-N1 human astrocytoma cells. PMA, carbachol, and EGF all stimulated rapid accumulation of mRNA for the proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-myc in the normal cells; in the protein kinase C-deficient cells, carbachol and EGF, but not PMA, retained this effect, which was not mimicked by the calcium ionophore A23187. Both carbachol and PMA activated protein kinase C in these cells, as evidenced by the stimulated phosphorylation of an acidic Mr 80,000 protein kinase C substrate protein with phosphoamino acid and peptide map identity. This response was mimicked by several other neurotransmitters in these cells, including epinephrine, histamine, oxotremorine, and serotonin, and was abolished in cells made protein kinase C-deficient by preincubation with high concentrations of PMA. Both PMA and carbachol promoted the phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 and activated an S6 protein kinase in the normal but not in the protein kinase C-deficient cells. EGF, in contrast, did not appear to activate protein kinase C, but promoted the phosphorylation of S6 and activation of the S6 kinase in both normal and protein kinase C-deficient cells. We conclude that, in 1321-N1 cells, induction of c-fos and c-myc mRNA can occur through a protein kinase C-dependent pathway and one or more independent pathways, exemplified by the responses to carbachol and EGF in the protein kinase C-deficient cells."
https://openalex.org/W2058675020,"Comparison of amino acid sequences from human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and avian erythroblastosis virus erbB oncogene product suggests that v-erbB represents a truncated avian EGF receptor gene product. Although both proteins are transmembrane tyrosine kinases, the v-erbB protein lacks most of the extracellular ligand-binding domain and a 32-amino acid cytoplasmic sequence present in the human EGF receptor. To test the validity of the proposed origin of v-erbB and to investigate the functional significance of the deleted extracellular sequences, a chimeric gene encoding the extracellular and the transmembrane domain of the human EGF receptor joined to sequences coding for the cytoplasmic domain of the avian erbB oncogene product was constructed. When expressed in Rat1 fibroblasts, this reconstituted gene product (HER-erbB) was transported to the cell surface and bound EGF. Its autophosphorylation activity was stimulated by interaction with the ligand. Expression of the HER-erbB chimera led to anchorage-independent cell growth in soft agar and EGF-induced focus formation in Rat1 monolayers. Thus, it appears that v-erbB protein sequences in the chimeric receptor retain their transforming activity under the influence of the human extracellular EGF-binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W1499170713,"Previously, we and others have shown that epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates the synthesis of its own receptor and the accumulation of EGF receptor mRNA. Here, we demonstrate that the tumor promotor, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), like EGF, also stimulates receptor synthesis in the human breast carcinoma cell line, MDA468 cells. The receptor synthesis rate increased 5-fold with a peak at 8 h after exposure to TPA with half-maximal stimulation at a dose of 5 ng/ml TPA. This stimulation of receptor synthesis occurred despite a 30% decrease in general cellular protein synthesis. The increased receptor synthesis rate resulted in the accumulation of 60% more receptor protein as determined by quantitative immunoblotting using a newly developed monoclonal antibody, H9B4. Although TPA treatment resulted in an immediate loss of high affinity EGF-binding sites, the long-term effect was an increase in both the low and high affinity binding sites. The effects of EGF and TPA on receptor synthesis were not additive. Furthermore, down-regulation of protein kinase C (the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) by long-term TPA treatment resulted in cells unable to respond to the stimulatory effects of both TPA and EGF on receptor synthesis. Nevertheless, the TPA-pretreated cells were still growth-inhibited by EGF. These results suggest that the stimulatory effect of EGF on receptor synthesis requires protein kinase C, whereas the inhibitory effect of EGF on the proliferation of these cells does not. Although we confirmed that EGF stimulated the incorporation of phosphate into phosphatidylinositol in A431 cells, it failed to do so in the MDA468 cells. Thus, in MDA468 cells, EGF may require protein kinase C for part of its action, but we could not demonstrate an associated activation of phosphatidylinositol turnover by EGF. The exact mechanism of involvement of protein kinase C in EGF action is still not clear."
https://openalex.org/W1568858778,"When [3H]myoinositol-prelabeled pancreatic minilobules were incubated with carbamylcholine (CCh) for 30 min, followed by ionophoresis on paper of the aqueous extracts, there were distinct peaks of radioactivity immediately preceding inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (IP2) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which, based on earlier studies with inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate (IcP), are the expected positions for inositol 1,2-cyclic 4-bisphosphate (IcP2) and inositol 1,2-cylic 4,5-trisphosphate (IcP3). These peaks were essentially absent on ionopherograms of extracts from minilobules not incubated with CCh. Similar results were obtained with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), except that the putative inositol cyclic phosphate peaks eluted immediately before the non-cyclic inositol polyphosphates, as to be expected. Taking advantage of the unique acid lability of the inositol cyclic phosphates, we demonstrate that the putative inositol cyclic polyphosphate peaks were specifically eliminated by prior hydrolysis of the aqueous extracts, as shown by either ionophoresis or HPLC. After preparative isolation of putative IcP2 and IcP3 by ionophoresis, acid hydrolysis shifted the positions of putative IcP2 and IcP3 peaks to the positions of standard IP2 and IP3, respectively, as shown by either ionophoresis or HPLC. The amounts of IcP, IcP2, and IcP3 formed on CCh stimulation, as measured by ionophoresis, were 0.7, 6.8, and 29.8% of that of, IP, IP2, and IP3, respectively (average of two experiments which agreed within 10%)."
https://openalex.org/W1480265650,"Interleukin 2 (IL-2) and the synthetic diacylglycerol, 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG), a direct activator of protein kinase C, induce phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein in a murine IL-2-dependent lymphocyte clone. The phosphorylation of S6 protein was correlated with increased protein synthesis in this cell line. Using cell-free assay systems, two unique kinases capable of phosphorylating the S6 protein were identified, namely, a calcium/phospholipid-dependent phosphotransferase, protein kinase C, and a second phospholipid-independent kinase detected in crude cytosolic fractions. Peptide mapping of the S6 protein demonstrated that the degree of S6 phosphorylation stimulated by IL-2 and OAG was similar to that achieved using the second (calcium/phospholipid-independent) kinase but not to the level of phosphorylation achieved with protein kinase C. The kinase responsible for phosphorylating S6 was soluble in stimulated cells and was induced in a time-dependent manner by either IL-2 or diacylglycerol treatment of intact cells. These data support the notion that, although protein kinase C is activated by IL-2 or OAG, subsequent events such as S6 phosphorylation may be the result of the activation of secondary phosphotransferase systems regulated by protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W2129646504,"We have previously shown that treatment of T lymphocytes with mitogenic ligands induces a rapid activation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) through a mechanism that is independent of protein synthesis but requires energy and an intact cytoskeleton. Here we show by immunoprecipitation experiments and by chemical analyses that ODC is covalently linked to the cell membrane by inositol. Treatment of sonicated cells with a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from B. thuringiensis caused a rapid 3-fold increase in ODC activity. Similar treatment of intact cells had no effect, suggesting that the ODC is attached to the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane. We conclude that ODC release and activation occur by a novel mechanism involving phosphatidylinositol breakdown following ligand-receptor interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2115581333,"A study was carried out on the uptake of copper, zinc, or cadmium ions and their induction of metallothionein synthesis in Menkes' and normal lymphoblastoid cells. The main difference between Menkes' and normal cells in the uptake of these metal ions was an increased uptake of copper ions in Menkes' cells at a low concentration of CuCl2 (2.1 microM). The CuCl2 concentration necessary to induce metallothionein synthesis in Menkes' cells was 50 microM, whereas that in normal cells was about 200 microM. The levels of zinc or cadmium ions needed to induce metallothionein in Menkes' cells were similar to those in normal cells. At least four isomers of metallothionein were induced by copper, zinc, and cadmium ions in both types of cells. Metallothionein synthesis in Menkes' and normal cells was induced when the amounts of intracellular copper reached a threshold level of approximately 0.2 nmol/10(6) cells, and the rate of metallothionein synthesis in these cells was increased as a function of the amounts of intracellular copper (0.2-1.7 nmol/10(6) cells). These results indicate that the induction of metallothionein synthesis in lymphoblastoid cells is controlled by the level of intracellular copper, suggesting that the major defect in Menkes' cells is not due to the abnormal regulation of metallothionein synthesis but to an alteration of the copper metabolism in cells by which the levels of intracellular copper become larger than those in normal cells and just lower than the threshold level for induction of metallothionein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1554189272,"Abstract Deoxyoligonucleotides containing deoxyinosine residues at positions corresponding to ambiguous nucleotides derived from an amino acid sequence have been successfully used as hybridization probes. It is assumed that the hypoxanthine residue can make base pairs with multiple bases. In order to obtain direct evidence for I:A base-pairing, a self-complementary deoxyoligonucleotide, d(G-G-I-A-C-C), was synthesized and its properties were examined by NMR spectroscopy. Three hydrogen-bonded imino proton resonances are observed at low temperatures in H2O suggesting the formation of a self-duplex with complete base pairing. Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) experiments showed that a signal at 15.1 ppm originated from the imino proton (H1) of the dI residue (I3) which is hydrogen-bonded to the dA residue (A4). Both the I3 and A4 residues were assumed to have taken an anti glycosidic conformation since irradiating the H1 of I3 gave NOEs both to its own H2 and to that of A4, an NOE also being observed between the H2 protons of I3 and A4. Comparison of the 31P NMR spectra of d(G-G-I-A-C-C) and d(G-G-I-C-C-C) showed the backbone structure of d(G-G-I-A-C-C) to have been disturbed by the presence of purine:purine base pairs in the middle of the hexamer duplex."

Using a panel of fluorescent probes, we found that membrane depolarization induced by PMA and fMLP in granulocytes, and elevation in [Ca2+]i stimulated by fMLP, were absent in myeloblasts. When we induced differentiation with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors, we found that both ionic responses appeared at approximately the promyelocyte stage. By using di-O-C5(3), we detected an initial phase of fMLP-induced hyperpolarization which appeared ontogenetically earlier than depolarization and which could be evoked in mature granulocytes with lower concentrations of the ligand. Hyperpolarization was partially dependent on extracellular Na+, was abrogated by increasing the external K+ concentration, and was accompanied by mild acidification of the cytoplasm. Bordetella pertussis toxin abolished both hyperpolarization and depolarization. Our findings indicate that shifts in [Ca2+]i and membrane potential changes in response to PMA and fMLP evolve as granulocytes mature. In addition, transmembrane ionic fluxes induced by fMLP appear to be more complex than previously considered, involving at least two separable phases of membrane potential change."
https://openalex.org/W1494210070,"Phorbol ester sensitive EL4 cells become growth-inhibited and produce interleukin 2 when treated with phorbol-12, 13-dibutyrate. Resistant cells lack both responses. To determine whether the defect in phorbol ester-resistant EL4 cells occurs pre- or post-transcriptionally, a hybridization assay for interleukin 2 mRNA was developed using two synthetic oligonucleotides complementary to mouse interleukin 2 mRNA as probes. Both probes hybridized to a 1-kilobase band in RNA from phorbol ester-treated sensitive cells. This RNA was detectable within 3 h of phorbol ester administration, and accumulation peaked by 12 h. The 1-kilobase band was induced in a concentration-dependent manner by 4-beta-phorbol-12, 13-dibutyrate but not by the inactive analog, 4-alpha-phorbol-12, 13-dibutyrate. No bands hybridizing with the interleukin 2 probe were detected in RNA isolated from unstimulated cells or from phorbol ester-resistant EL4 cells at any time up to 24 h following phorbol ester stimulation. The accumulation of the RNA in sensitive cells was blocked when the protein synthesis inhibitors, cycloheximide (75 microM) or puromycin (90 microM) were added within 1 h of the addition of phorbol ester. If cycloheximide was added 2 or more h after phorbol ester treatment, superinduction of the 1-kilobase band was observed. These results indicate that the failure of phorbol ester-resistant EL4 cells to produce interleukin 2 is due to a defect proximal to interleukin 2 transcription and that the accumulation of interleukin 2 mRNA in phorbol ester-sensitive EL4 cells requires protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1576206166,"Gene 1.2 of bacteriophage T7, located near the primary origin of DNA replication at position 15.37 on the T7 chromosome, encodes a 10,059-dalton protein that is essential for growth on Escherichia coli optA1 strains (Saito, H., and Richardson, C. C. (1981) J. Virol. 37, 343-351). In the absence of the T7 1.2 and E. coli optA gene products, the degradation of E. coli DNA proceeds normally, and T7 DNA synthesis is initiated at the primary origin. However, T7 DNA synthesis ceases prematurely and the newly synthesized DNA is degraded; no viable phage particles are released. The gene 1.2 protein has been purified to apparent homogeneity from cells in which the cloned 1.2 gene is overexpressed. Purification of the [35S] methionine-labeled protein was followed by monitoring the radioactivity of the protein and by gel electrophoresis. The purified protein has been identified as the product of gene 1.2 on the basis of molecular weight and partial amino acid sequence. We have found that extracts of E. coli optA1 cells infected with T7 gene 1.2 mutants are defective in packaging exogenous T7 DNA when such extracts are prepared late in infection. Purified gene 1.2 protein restores packaging activity to these defective extracts, thus providing a biological assay for gene 1.2 protein. No specific enzymatic activity has been found associated with the purified gene 1.2 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1658828682,"Two different forms of crystals (potentially) suitable for x-ray structure analysis were obtained for recombinant human interleukin-2 (IL-2) using ammonium sulfate as a precipitant in the pH range of 6.3-7.3 (in the case of hexagonal bipyramidal crystals) and 4.5-5.5 (in the case of plate crystals). The hexagonal bipyramidal crystal belongs to a hexagonal space group P6(2)22 or P6(4)22 with a = b = 105.8 A and c = 122.2 A. The crystal diffracts up to 3.4 A resolution and contains 2 or 3 IL-2 molecules in an asymmetric unit. The plate crystal belongs to an orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2 with a = 47.9 A, b = 79.6 A, and c = 31.9 A. The crystal diffracts up to 2.5 A resolution and contains only 1 IL-2 molecule in an asymmetric unit. These facts reconfirmed crystallographically the high homogeneity of the present preparation of human recombinant IL-2."
https://openalex.org/W1549617317,"Abstract Amphibian metamorphosis affords a useful experimental system in which to study thyroid hormone regulation of gene expression during postembryonic vertebrate development. In order to isolate gene-specific cDNA probes which correspond to thyroid hormone-responsive mRNAs, we employed differential colony hybridization of a cDNA library constructed from poly(A)+ RNA of thyroxine-treated premetamorphic tadpole liver. From an initial screening of about 6000 transformants, 32 potentially positive colonies were obtained. The recombinant cDNA-plasmids from 13 of these colonies plus two potentially negative colonies were purified for further study. Southern blot analysis of the plasmid DNA was employed to determine whether different cDNAs encoded for the same mRNA. The effect of thyroid hormone on the relative levels of specific mRNA species was examined by Northern analysis of liver RNA from premetamorphic tadpoles, thyroxine-treated tadpoles, and adult bullfrogs. Three independent cDNA clones were obtained which encoded thyroid hormone-enhanced mRNAs. We also obtained two independent cDNA clones encoding thyroid hormone-inhibited mRNAs and three independent clones encoding thyroid hormone-unresponsive mRNAs. The levels of two thyroid hormone-enhanced mRNAs and one thyroid hormone-inhibited mRNA were essentially the same in the thyroid hormone-treated tadpole liver and adult liver, suggesting that thyroid hormone induces stable changes in liver gene expression during spontaneous metamorphosis. Using selected cDNAs, RNA dot blot analysis of liver mRNA from tadpoles at different stages of metamorphosis showed that the level of one thyroid hormone-enhanced mRNA increased during late prometamorphosis and metamorphic climax. Similarly, a mRNA which was strongly inhibited by thyroid hormone treatment was observed to decline during prometamorphosis and reach undetectable levels during metamorphic climax. One mRNA was detected which was reproducibly inhibited by thyroid hormone treatment but which remained essentially unchanged during spontaneous metamorphosis. These results provide the first direct evidence for the coordinate and selective pretranslational regulation by thyroid hormone of several liver genes during the developmental process of metamorphosis."
https://openalex.org/W1586128230,"The initial rates of tryptic digestion at the 50/20-kDa junction in myosin subfragment 1 (S-1) were determined for free S-1, acto-S-1, and acto-S-1 in the presence of magnesium adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Mg AMP-PNP) and MgATP under ionic strength conditions ranging from 30 to 124 mM. The percentage of S-1 bound to actin in the presence of Mg AMP-PNP and MgATP was calculated from these rates for each set of digestion experiments. Parallel experiments carried out in an Airfuge centrifuge on identical acto-S-1 solutions yielded independent information on the binding of S-1 to actin. The results of binding measurements by these two methods were in excellent agreement in all cases tested, covering the range from 15 to 95% binding of S-1 to actin. Tryptic digestions of synthetic mixtures of S-1 and p-phenylenedimaleimide S-1 in the presence of actin demonstrated that a two-component system of myosin heads with different affinities for actin can be resolved into its constituents by the proteolytic rates method. The results of this work justify applications of the proteolytic rates method to actomyosin binding studies in more complex systems."
