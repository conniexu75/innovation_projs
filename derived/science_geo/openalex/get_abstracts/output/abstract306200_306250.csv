Thus, behavior in the laboratory may be a reliable indication of behavior in the earth's crust, for electrical resistivity, permeability, or other properties that depend on microporosity."

https://openalex.org/W1965693067,Stridulating Uhler's katydids produce the most complex song known for insects. Series of four types of sounds are made in stereotyped sequence. Sound-synchronized high-speed photography reveals that each type of sound is produced by a distinctively different wing-movement cycle. The most complex of these cycles includes a two-step closure and a nearly silent close-open movement.

https://openalex.org/W1992462532,The magnetic material in the lunar soils makes them potentially strong carriers of remanence and magnetically viscous. The soils therefore block remanence in the temperature range of the lunar diurnal cycle. This remanence is stable against alternating-field demagnetization. A mechanism whereby such hard natural remanent magnetization may be acquired by material buried in the regolith is proposed.

https://openalex.org/W1970247795,"The three lowest gravitational modes of free oscillation of the North Atlantic Ocean are estimated by numerical integration of Laplace's tidal equations. These modes have periods of approximately 21, 14, and 11 hours, and structures, respectively, of one, two, and three positive amphidromic systems. The phase distribution of the first mode resembles cotidal charts of the diurnal tide, and the period of the second mode is consistent with that inferred by Wunsch from tidal data in Bermuda and the Azores."
https://openalex.org/W2014898901,"Historical trends in U.S. coal production, transportation and utilization and their causes are analyzed. The changing structure of the coal industry and its possible future direction, as it is driven by the effects of the oil embargo and world oil prices, are examined. National policies in the United States to increase coal use from indigenous sources in order to diversify and increase reliability of supply raise questions as to availability of coal supply and potential markets. Possible constraints on U.S. coal production, transportation, and utilization are appraised and it is concluded that increased coal consumption is ""demand constrained."" The causes and potential means of removal of these limitations are examined."

https://openalex.org/W4239599695,"In R. Jeffrey Smith's News and Comment article ""Antisatellite weapon sets dangerous course"" (14 Oct., p. 140), a remark on page 141 (column 3) by Richard Garwin about the usefulness of rockets, balloons, and aircraft to supplant U.S. photoreconnaissance and meterological satellites was inadvertently attributed to Robert Buchheim. And a characterization on page 141 (column 2) of the Soviet antisatellite weapon, or ASAT, was actually made by General Lewis Allen, the former Air Force chief of staff, not by General David Jones, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Finally, a footnote on page 142 should have identified the Patriot as an air-to-air missile, not an air-to-ground missile."
