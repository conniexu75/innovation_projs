https://openalex.org/W1558122435,"The effect of acetylation on the DNA binding properties of the rigidly conserved histone H4 amino-terminal tail has been studied in detail using the technique of thermal denaturation. The quantitative DNA-binding parameters for both the non- and fully acetylated H4 amino terminus have been determined from thermal denaturation data for complexes of the peptides bound to mixed sequence 146-base pair DNA. We find that under dilute buffer conditions (5 mM Tris-HCl) the binding constant for the non-acetylated peptide to double-stranded DNA is 5 x 10(11) M-1 and that acetylation of lysine residues in the peptide reduces the binding constant to 1 x 10(5) M-1. The dramatic differences observed in the binding constants for the non- and fully acetylated peptides are probably due to the effect of acetylation on the even distribution of positively charged residues in the H4 amino terminus. In other experiments, the binding of both peptides to a 30-base pair oligonucleotide has been studied in solution with varying concentrations of sodium, magnesium, and phosphate ions. These experiments demonstrate that both magnesium and phosphate ions have strong effects on the binding of the H4 tail to DNA, especially weakening the binding of the acetylated peptide. For instance, the dissociation of the non-acetylated peptide from DNA requires 6 mM magnesium, yet the binding of the acetylated peptide is abolished in only 30 microM magnesium. The modulation of the DNA binding interactions of the H4 amino terminus by physiologically relevant ionic conditions, in addition to the effect of acetylation, can be important in the regulation of chromatin structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W1579421676,"Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) is a naturally occurring metabolite of NAD+ that is as potent as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) in mobilizing Ca2+ in sea urchin eggs. Previous pharmacological evidence suggests that cADPR acts through a system similar to the Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). Here I showed that in the presence of low concentrations of cADPR addition of Ca2+ to egg homogenates stimulated further release of Ca2+ in a concentration-dependent manner. In the absence of cADPR, no induced release was seen, and the added Ca2+ was, instead, sequestered by a thapsigargin-sensitive transport system. High concentrations of strontium (> 50 microM) could also induce Ca2+ release. The effective concentrations of Sr2+, however, were reduced 10-20-fold in the presence of low concentrations of cADPR. Barium, at up to 0.4 mM, did not stimulate Ca2+ release with or without cADPR. The potentiation between divalent cations and cADPR was mutual since the Ca2+ releasing activity of cADPR was also increased in the presence of strontium. Ionomycin and thapsigargin both released Ca2+ but neither potentiated Ca2+ release induced by divalent cations. Caffeine also released Ca2+ in a concentration-dependent manner, and its potency was greatly increased by low concentrations of cADPR, while no such simulation was seen with IP3. Conversely, low concentrations of caffeine that were not sufficient to release Ca2+ increased the effectiveness of cADPR 10-fold. Isocaffeine, an isomer of caffeine, was four to five times less effective, demonstrating the specificity of the caffeine effect. These results suggest that cADPR can function as an endogenous regulator of CICR in eggs."
https://openalex.org/W1543454781,"The mannose receptor of macrophage and hepatic endothelial cells discriminates between endogenous and exogenous sugar-bearing structures. Previous competition studies have indicated that the receptor binds the monosaccharides mannose, fucose, and N-acetylglucosamine but displays much higher affinity for multivalent oligosaccharides, such as those found on the surface of potentially pathogenic microorganisms. The hydrodynamic properties of the receptor have been examined, revealing that the receptor is a monomer. This result suggests that multiple carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) in the extracellular domain of a single receptor polypeptide cooperate to achieve high affinity binding of complex ligands. In order to determine the importance of individual CRDs, properties of receptor segments containing groups of CRDs expressed in insect cells have been examined. The results indicate that two of the CRDs (4 and 5) form a protease-resistant, ligand-binding core but that five CRDs in tandem (4-8) are required to match the affinity of the intact receptor for yeast mannan. A consequence of the organization of the receptor is that both valency and geometry of glycoconjugates are important determinants of binding affinity."
https://openalex.org/W1570050776,"The Alzheimer beta/A4 amyloid precursor protein (APP) can be proteolytically processed by at least two separate pathways in PC12 cells: chloroquine-insensitive secretory cleavage and chloroquine-sensitive intracellular degradation, presumably in the endosomal/lysosomal system. To further investigate the possibility of APP processing in the endosomal/lysosomal system, we have examined whether APP is present in clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs), which mediate the transport of many proteins to the endosomal compartment. Using a procedure derived from established protocols for the purification of CCVs from mammalian organs, we obtained from PC12 cells highly purified CCVs that displayed the same morphological features as described for CCVs purified from other sources. The CCVs were enriched in full-length mature (fully post-translationally modified) forms of APP, as well as in the carboxyl-terminal APP fragment produced by the secretory cleavage pathway. As CCVs are known to be involved in only two intracellular pathways (trafficking from the plasma membrane to early endosomes, and from the trans-Golgi network to late endosomes/prelysosomes), these findings provide direct evidence that APP is transported to the endosomal/lysosomal system. Furthermore, the presence in CCVs of the carboxyl-terminal fragment resulting from APP secretory cleavage suggests that APP secretory processing occurs in a pre-CCV compartment."
https://openalex.org/W1492516958,"The plasmid-borne arsenical resistance (ars) operon encodes an arsenical-translocating ATPase and confers resistance to antimonials and arsenicals in Escherichia coli by extrusion of the toxic compounds from the cytosol. The trans-acting regulatory ArsR protein was shown to bind to a fragment of DNA containing the ars promoter. Hybrid formation of the ArsR protein with a ArsR-beta-lactamase chimeric protein suggested that the active form of the ArsR repressor is a dimer. From footprinting analysis the binding site was defined as a region of imperfect dyad symmetry just upstream of the -35 site. In vivo the operon was derepressed by oxyions of +III oxidation state of arsenic, antimony, and bismuth, as well as arsenate (As(V)), whereas in vitro ArsR protein-operator interaction was reduced by each of those compounds except arsenate, as determined by gel retardation and DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments. This indicates that arsenate is not a true inducer and must be reduced to arsenite in vivo to induce. An operator mutant obtained by deletion of the in vitro ArsR-protected DNA sequence exhibited constitutive ars promoter activity, demonstrating that the binding site is the functional target for the ArsR repressor in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1516917377,"The imino sugar N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ) exhibits anti-HIV activity in vitro and inhibits the purified glycoprocessing enzyme alpha 1,2-glucosidase I. It has been speculated that the anti-viral activity of this compound may result from inhibition of HIV envelope glycoprotein processing. However, structural evidence that glucosidase inhibition takes place in intact cells at the anti-viral concentration (0.5 mM) is lacking. In this study, N-linked glycosylation of recombinant gp120 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells cultured in the presence or absence of NB-DNJ has been characterized. Immunoprecipitation, in conjunction with endoglycosidase H (endo H) digestion and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, revealed that the glycosylation of gp120 was profoundly altered in the presence of NB-DNJ. The majority of the gp120 oligosaccharides from untreated cells were resistant to endo H. However, nearly complete endo H sensitivity was observed following treatment with 0.5 mM NB-DNJ indicating that gp120 expressed in treated cells carries immature, high mannose type oligosaccharides. In addition, using metabolic labeling with [3H]mannose, gel filtration chromatography, and digestion with highly purified glucosidases I and II, we provide the first definitive evidence that glucosidase I inhibition occurs at the anti-viral concentration of NB-DNJ. These data indicate that glucosidase inhibition is a candidate mechanism for the anti-viral activity of this compound."
https://openalex.org/W1524473687,"The beta-thymosins are a family of related peptides. Recently, thymosin beta 4 was identified as a significant actin monomer sequestering protein in cells. To determine if other beta-thymosins also bind actin, and how they may participate in the regulation of actin polymerization, we expressed thymosin beta 4 and its major homolog, thymosin beta 10, in bacteria and characterized their interactions with actin. Equilibrium sedimentation studies showed that thymosin beta 4 behaved as a monomeric protein in solution. Both beta-thymosins bound skeletal muscle actin and inhibited actin polymerization with similar Kd values (between 0.7-1 microM). They were not inhibited by polyphosphoinositides. Kinetic measurements showed that at high ratios of beta-thymosin to actin, beta-thymosin decreased the rate of barbed end filament growth. However, in spite of a close agreement between the kinetic and steady state Kd values, the rate of barbed end filament growth was slightly, but reproducibly, larger than expected, and this deviation was particularly noticeable at lower ratios of beta-thymosin to actin. We conclude that unlike profilin, beta-thymosins are primarily actin monomer sequestering proteins, although some aspects of their interactions with actin are still not completely understood."
https://openalex.org/W1497077766,"The vacuolar membrane H(+)-ATPase of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a multisubunit enzyme complex composed of an integral membrane V0 sector, and a peripherally associated V1 sector. Deletion of one of several structural genes for vacuolar H(+)-ATPase subunits was previously demonstrated to prevent proper assembly of the remaining V1 subunits onto the vacuolar membrane (Kane, P.M., Kuehn, M.C., Howald-Stevenson, I., and Stevens, T.H. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 447-454). A genetic screen was designed to identify new genes whose products were essential for the synthesis, assembly, and/or function of the yeast vacuolar H(+)-ATPase. Mutants were identified based on phenotypes associated with vacuolar membrane H(+)-ATPase loss of function (vma), including an inability to grow on media buffered at neutral pH. Representatives in five complementation groups were identified, including four novel mutant vma5, vma21, vma22, and vma23, all of which were defective in vacuolar ATPase enzyme activity. We report here the characterization of two genes, VMA4 and VMA5, that encode peripheral subunits of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase. We determined that VMA5 encodes the 42-kDa subunit of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase. The VMA4 gene, originally described by Foury (Foury, F. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 18554-18560), was determined to encode the 27-kDa subunit of the purified yeast vacuolar H(+)-ATPase. Characterization of the vma5 and vma4 mutants revealed that the 42- and 27-kDa subunits are essential for the assembly of the peripheral membrane portion of the H(+)-ATPase onto the vacuolar membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1602846778,"rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) is an inhibitory GDP/GTP exchange protein for a group of small GTP-binding proteins including at least rhoA p21, rhoB p21, rac1 p21, rac2 p21, and G25K. Microinjection of rho GDI into Swiss 3T3 cells made the cells round and refractile. This morphological change was accompanied by the disappearance of stress fibers. The rho GDI action was prevented by comicroinjection of rho GDI with the guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S)-bound form of rhoA p21, but not with the GTP gamma S-bound form of rhoA p21 lacking the C-terminal three amino acids, which was not post-translationally modified with lipids. The GTP gamma S-bound form of rac1 p21, the same form of G25K, the same form of smg p21B, or Ki-rasval12 p21 was ineffective. Microinjection of the bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferase C3 specific for rho p21 into Swiss 3T3 cells induced the similar changes of morphology and stress fibers. This C3 action was not prevented by comicroinjection of C3 with the GTP gamma S-bound form of rhoA p21, but was prevented by comicroinjection with the same form of a rhoA p21 mutant which was not ADP-ribosylated by C3. These results indicate that the rho GDI-rho p21 system regulates cell morphology presumably through the actomyosin system in Swiss 3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1589852164,"The nucleotide sequence of the operon for the putrescine transport system that maps at 19 min on the Escherichia coli chromosome was determined. It contained four open reading frames encoding potF, -G, -H, and -I proteins. The potF protein (M(r) = 38,000) was inferred to be a putrescine-specific binding protein existing in a periplasmic fraction from the results of Western blot analysis of the cell fractions and from measurements of polyamine binding to the protein. The potG protein (M(r) = 45,000) had consensus amino acid sequences for the nucleotide-binding site. The potH (M(r) = 35,000) and potI (M(r) = 31,000) proteins consisted of six putative transmembrane-spanning segments linked by hydrophilic segments of variable length as shown by hydropathy profiles. The spermidine-putrescine transport system, which is mainly involved in spermidine transport, consisted of potA, -B, -C, and -D proteins (Furuchi, T., Kashiwagi, K., Kobayashi, H., and Igarashi, K. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 20928-20933). The homologies of the corresponding two proteins between those two systems, F and D, G and A, H and B, and I and C, were 35, 42, 37, and 36%, respectively. The initiation point of the transcription of the operon for the putrescine transport system was determined by primer extension and S1 nuclease mapping. Transcription started from the T residue located either 149 or 150 nucleotides upstream from the initiator AUG codon of potF protein mRNA. By making several subclones and a mutant lacking the potF gene, we showed that the expression of all four proteins was necessary for maximal putrescine transport activity. These results indicate that the putrescine transport system can also be defined as a bacterial periplasmic transport system."
https://openalex.org/W1553235593,"In serum-deprived human fibroblasts IMR-90 and WI-38 cells, the addition of fetal calf serum or basic fibroblast growth factor stimulates DNA synthesis in an extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent manner; the effect of serum on [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA is 4-16-fold greater at 2.0 mM CaCl2 as compared with that at 0.03 mM CaCl2. By contrast, in SV40 virus-transformed WI-38 (SV-WI-38) cells DNA synthesis is essentially independent of the extracellular calcium concentration ([Ca]out) and serum growth factors. To explore the role of Ca2+ in mitogenic signal transduction through G1 to S phase cell cycle progression, we studied and compared the effect of [Ca]out on phosphorylation of RB protein, the product of a tumor suppressor retinoblastoma gene. In IMR-90 and WI-38 cells, serum or basic fibroblast growth factor induces an increase in the amount of hyperphosphorylated forms of RB protein in a manner strictly dependent on [Ca]out. In sharp contrast, in SV-WI-38 cells, the extent of RB phosphorylation is little affected by [Ca]out or the presence or absence of serum growth factors. In addition, potent calmodulin antagonists W-7 and calmidazolium, but not an inactive analogue W-12 or W-5, strongly inhibit serum-induced increases in DNA synthesis and RB phosphorylation in IMR-90 and WI-38 cells, whereas in SV-WI-38 cells, the inhibitory effect is much more limited. Under the same treatment conditions, we measured histone H1 kinase activity associated with anti-p34cdc2 immunoprecipitate and found that the serum-induced increase in p34cdc2 kinase activity is strongly dependent on [Ca]out and is potently inhibited by the active calmodulin antagonists in IMR-90 and WI-38 cells, but not in SV-WI-38 cells. In IMR-90 cells that have been incubated with serum in 0.03 mM [Ca]out for 24 h, restoration of [Ca]out to 2.0 mM results in initiation of DNA synthesis after 13 h and concomitant increases in RB phosphorylation and p34cdc2 histone H1 kinase activity. These results suggest that in human fibroblasts, Ca2+/calmodulin regulates the signaling cascade leading to cdc2 kinase activation, RB protein phosphorylation, and DNA synthesis and that this Ca(2+)-dependent regulation is abrogated in SV40-transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W1496393474,"Poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) (PHAs) were isolated from Pseudomonas putida KT2442 cultivated on petroselenic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid to study beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. Both saturated and unsaturated medium chain length 3-hydroxy fatty acids were found to be constituents of these polymers. With the aid of proton-detected multiple quantum coherence and proton-detected multiple bond coherence NMR spectra the structures of the unsaturated monomers were identified as 3-hydroxy-5-cis-tetradecanoate for PHA produced on oleic acid, and 3-hydroxy-6-cis-dodecanoate and 3-hydroxy-5-cis-8-cis-tetradecadienoate for PHA produced on linoleic acid. The identified structures, which are derived from fatty acid degradation intermediates, indicate a degradation of oleic acid via the enoyl-CoA isomerase-dependent route and a degradation of linoleic acid via the dienoyl-CoA reductase-dependent route."
https://openalex.org/W1547458189,"Fura-2-loaded platelets were immobilized on fibrinogen, and cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured by video imaging of the fluorescence signal. In the immobilized, single platelets, ADP and low doses of thrombin evoked repetitive spikes of [Ca2+]i, whereas higher thrombin concentrations gave elevated plateaus in [Ca2+]i. Stimulation of the cells with thrombin after the addition of ADP changed the frequency of spiking, but not the maximal levels of [Ca2+]i reached. In suspensions of platelets, ADP and low doses of thrombin evoked transient elevation of myo-inositol phosphates, suggesting that the initiation of spiking was due to stimulation of phospholipase C. In platelet suspensions, the Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (TG) evoked a gradual rise in [Ca2+]i, which was potentiated by preactivation of the platelets and inhibited by prostaglandin E1 and nitroprusside. In single platelets, TG induced a sudden increase in [Ca2+]i after a long but variable delay, followed by a phase of slow oscillations. The effects of preactivation with ADP were 2-fold: the delay time before the response to TG was shortened and the maximal level of [Ca2+]i reached with TG was higher than the level of the preceding Ca2+ spikes. Apparently, Ca2+ responses induced by the inhibition of Ca(2+)-ATPases are potentiated by prior elevation of [Ca2+]i and reduced by substances that inhibit agonist-evoked increases in [Ca2+]i. The data point to a mechanism of Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release and the presence of TG-sensitive and TG-insensitive Ca2+ stores in platelets. Rapid spiking may involve both pools, whereas the latter alone may account for the slow TG-evoked oscillations."
https://openalex.org/W1493753651,"The potent antihypertensive drug reserpine inhibits the transport of biogenic amines into adrenal chromaffin granules and synaptic vesicles. Reserpine acts by binding almost irreversibly to the vesicular amine transporter, and this interaction has been used both to study the mechanism of transport and to purify the protein responsible. Recent isolation of a cDNA for the rat chromaffin granule amine transporter (CGAT) by selection in the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium now permits an analysis of the interaction with reserpine at a molecular level. Using membranes from stable transformants expressing the transporter, we show that reserpine binds specifically and quantitatively to CGAT. As with the native protein in bovine chromaffin granules, a pH gradient accelerates reserpine binding, and amine substrates compete for binding with reserpine. However, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium and tetrabenazine, the other principal inhibitor of vesicular amine transport, compete very poorly with reserpine for binding, suggesting that they interact with CGAT at distinct sites."
https://openalex.org/W1573354836,"A 2.1-kilobase pair region located just upstream of the mouse aprt (adenine phosphoribosyltransferase) gene has a methylation pattern that is conserved in mouse tissues and culture cell lines. This upstream region includes four HpaII/MspI sites. Two of these sites are fully methylated, one is partially methylated, and one is unmethylated. Transfection experiments have demonstrated that the conserved methylation pattern can be reproduced in a mouse embryonal carcinoma stem cell line via novo methylation (Turker, M.S., Mummaneni, P., and Bishop, P.L. (1991) Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 17, 151-157). To examine the molecular basis of the conserved methylation pattern, a plasmid-based deletion analysis was conducted by removing and rearranging specific portions of the upstream region. Unmethylated versions of these plasmid constructs were then transfected into the mouse stem cell line and the methylation status of the remaining HpaII/MspI sites determined with a Southern blot analysis. By using this approach, a cis-acting sequence within the upstream region of approximately 0.8 kilobase pairs was identified which appears responsible for the conserved methylation pattern. We use the term de novo methylation center to denote this sequence. Based on the results obtained, a model is offered to explain the formation of the conserved methylation pattern in the upstream region."
https://openalex.org/W1570892680,"After direct photoaffinity cross-linking of [3H]GTP to the beta-subunit of tubulin, followed by tryptic digestion and alkaline phosphatase treatment, we employed cis-diol-specific boronate gel chromatography and reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography to purify a peptide containing most of the covalently bound radioactivity. The sequence of this peptide corresponded to that of residues 3-19 of beta-tubulin. Residue 10 of the peptide, which is Cys-12 in beta-tubulin, could not be identified. The fast atom bombardment mass spectrum of this peptide showed the presence of a predominant species with a molecular mass of 2022 kDa (2021 kDa for the 12C variant), which is 255 Da greater than the molecular mass of the peptide. Fast atom bombardment collision-activated decomposition mass spectrometry analysis produced fragments which are consistent with the beta(3-19) peptide but having a unit of mass of 358 at position 12. Thermolysin digestion of the tryptic peptide restricted the cross-linking site to the 9-amino acid sequence, I(L)QAGQXGNQ. The molecular mass of this peptide was 1174 kDa, which is equal to the mass of the beta(7-15) peptide containing an extra group of mass 255. To explain the molecular masses of the two labeled peptides, which are 26 atomic mass units less than expected, a mechanism of photolabeling is proposed that involves opening of the guanine ring and loss of the C-6 carbonyl function as CO2."

https://openalex.org/W1509898263,"Transport and secretion of recombinant human acetylcholinesterase (rHuAChE) were studied in transfected human 293 cells expressing either the oligomerized soluble enzyme or a monomeric mutant derivative in which Cys-580 was substituted by alanine (C580A). In cells expressing the wild-type enzyme, the gradual assembly of newly synthesized intracellular rHuAChE monomers into oligomers occurs within the endoplasmic reticulum. Secretion of mature wild-type enzyme into the medium is efficient and appears to be exclusive to multimeric forms. Consistently, intracellular oligomers, but not monomers, are endoglycosidase H-resistant, indicating that only oligomers undergo terminal glycosylation in the wild-type enzyme. In contrast, in cells expressing the dimerization-defective C580A mutant, newly synthesized rHuAChE monomers undergo terminal glycosylation and are secreted into the medium as efficiently as wild-type multimers. No significant difference between the intracellular transport rates of wild-type rHuAChE oligomers and mutant C580A monomers was revealed by probing with specific lectins. In both systems, transport and processing prior to the trans-Golgi galactosylation compartment appear to be rate-limiting, whereas the following passage to the cell surface is rapid. In conclusion, we suggest that in the presence of a free cysteine at the COOH terminus of the rHuAChE polypeptide, secretion of monomers is not effectuated, whereas in its absence, monomers are exported from the endoplasmic reticulum and are capable of traversing the entire secretory pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1586405595,The nuclear gene encoding the subunit epsilon of the catalytic sector F1 of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATP synthase was cloned and sequenced. Degenerated oligonucleotide primers were constructed from primary structure data. A part of the ATP epsilon gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from yeast genomic DNA. From the amplified DNA sequence a nondegenerated oligonucleotide probe was constructed and used for isolating a 2040-base pair EcoRI fragment bearing the whole gene. A 186-base pair open reading frame encoding a 62-amino acid polypeptide is described. The deduced amino acid sequence was one amino acid longer than the mature protein. A null mutant was constructed. The mutant strain was unable to grow on glycerol medium. The mutant mitochondria had no detectable oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity. The catalytic sector appeared unstable during purification but F0-subunits were still bound to F1. The mutation promoted a highly oligomycin-sensitive uncoupling of the mitochondrial respiration rate.
https://openalex.org/W1541403018,"5-Aminolevulinate synthase catalyzes the first step of the heme biosynthetic pathway in nonplant higher eukaryotes. A cDNA encoding for the mouse erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase (Schoenhaut, D. S., and Curtis, P.J. (1986) Gene (Amst.) 48, 55-63) has been expressed in Escherichia coli, using the alkaline phosphatase promoter, to a level of 50-60% of the total bacterial protein. Aminolevulinate synthase was overexpressed in an active form and, therefore, was able to rescue hemA mutants, which are unable to grow in the absence of 5-aminolevulinate. A simple purification from the aminolevulinate synthase-overproducing bacterial strain yielded approximately 50 mg of protein, in a high state of purity, per liter of bacterial culture. Moreover, the expressed aminolevulinate synthase could be easily concentrated up to 6-8 mg/ml. Significantly, recombinant aminolevulinate synthase retained physical and catalytic properties identical to those of natural sources. These include the dimeric structure, subunit molecular mass, and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate as an essential cofactor. Removal of the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate led to complete loss of activity. However, the apoenzyme could be readily reconstituted by incubation with 20 microM 5'-pyridoxal phosphate. The Km values are 51 mM for glycine and 55 microM for succinyl-CoA, in the same range of the Km values determined for the nonrecombinant enzyme. This report describes the overexpression of a mammalian 5-aminolevulinate synthase in E. coli and its purification from an overproducing strain. The ready availability of the pure, cloned, sequenced erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase makes it possible now for questions pertinent to the enzyme's structure, mechanism, and regulation to be addressed."
https://openalex.org/W1480899276,"Cultured ovine tracheal epithelial cells converted arachidonic acid to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), but microsome-containing subcellular fractions prepared from these cells under calcium-free conditions converted arachidonic acid to PGE2 and to 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) at a high rate (2-4 nmol/mg of protein/15 min). Identification of the membrane-bound 12-HETE-forming activity as a 12-lipoxygenase included 12S-stereospecificity of product formation and trapping of 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid as a reaction product. The 12-lipoxygenase activity was extracted from cell membranes only with detergent (1% Triton X-100), and the activity (membrane-bound or detergent-solubilized) was completely inactivated by mixing with the cytosol-containing subcellular fraction. The inhibitory effect of the cytosolic fraction was reversed by treating the cytosol with GSH-depleting agents (2-cyclohexene-1-one or N-ethylmaleimide) or by mixing it with lipid hydroperoxide (13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid) at a concentration that had little direct effect on enzyme activity. Inhibition of 12-lipoxygenase activity could also be achieved by treatment of enzyme preparations with GSH at levels (0.1-10 mM) found in epithelial cell cytosol. In addition, treatment of cultured epithelial cells with a GSH-depleting agent (buthionine sulfoximine) and lipid hydroperoxide restored cellular 12-lipoxygenase activity. Little or no detectable 12-lipoxygenase activity was found in freshly isolated ovine tracheal epithelial cells, but the cytosolic 12-lipoxygenase found in freshly isolated bovine tracheal epithelial cells was relatively insensitive to regulation by GSH or lipid hydroperoxide. These observations indicate that a 12-lipoxygenase is expressed in a cryptic, microsomal-type form in primary-culture epithelial cells and that this form of the enzyme may be selectively regulated by changes in cellular oxidation-reduction conditions dependent on cytosolic levels of GSH versus lipid hydroperoxide."
https://openalex.org/W1496997614,"Fifteen different structures of terminal GalNAc-containing N-linked oligosaccharides from human urinary kallidinogenase have been identified. These N-linked oligosaccharides were mostly neutral, because sialic acid content was lower than 0.13 mol of sialic acid/mol of sugar chain, and sulfate was not detected. The oligosaccharides were released from pepsin-digested protein by glycoamidase A (from almond) digestion. The reducing ends of the oligosaccharide chains were aminated with a fluorescent reagent, 2-aminopyridine. The resulting mixture of pyridylamino derivatives of the oligosaccharides were separated by high performance liquid chromatography on an ODS-silica column, and 15 oligosaccharides were isolated. The structure of each oligosaccharide fraction was analyzed by two-dimensional sugar mapping, component sugar analysis, high resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance and methylation analysis. It was found that each N-linked oligosaccharide associated with human urinary kallidinogenase contains unsubstituted GalNAc residues at the nonreducing terminal. These 15 oligosaccharides include 5 biantennary, 7 triantennary, and 3 tetraantennary oligosaccharides."

https://openalex.org/W1493309539,"vps17 mutants missort and secrete several vacuolar hydrolases. To analyze the role of the VPS17 gene in vacuolar protein delivery, we have cloned this gene by complementation of the vacuolar protein sorting defects of a vps17-5 mutant. Disruption of the VPS17 gene had no effect on the viability of haploid yeast cells, although they show an obvious defect in vacuolar morphology. vps17-disrupted cells contain numerous small vacuole-like compartments and also exhibit a severe defect in the sorting of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY), a soluble vacuolar hydrolase. 95% of CPY is missorted and secreted from the mutant cells. Vacuolar sorting of two other soluble hydrolases, proteinase A and proteinase B, is also affected, but to a lesser extent. Delivery and maturation of the vacuolar membrane protein alkaline phosphatase does not appear to be affected in a delta vps17 strain. The DNA sequence of the VPS17 clone indicates that the gene encodes a 551-amino-acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 63.1 kDa. The protein sequence is hydrophilic and contains no obvious N-terminal signal sequence or hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains, indicating that the Vps17p does not enter the secretory pathway. Using a Vps17p-specific polyclonal antiserum, we have demonstrated that the Vps17 protein is not modified with N-linked carbohydrates at any of its four potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The Vps17 protein, however, fractionates to a particulate fraction after centrifugation at 100,000 x g. Vps17p can be released from this particulate fraction by treatment with either Triton X-100 or urea, indicating that the Vps17p is peripherally associated with a crude membrane fraction. Based on these results, we propose that the Vps17p functions on the cytoplasmic surface of some intracellular organelle, possibly the Golgi complex or an intermediate in Golgi to vacuole transport, to facilitate the sorting and delivery of soluble vacuolar hydrolases. Vacuolar membrane protein traffic, however, appears to occur by a mechanism that is independent of Vps17p function."
https://openalex.org/W1583375627,"Transcriptional regulation by thyroid and steroid hormone receptors requires their recognition and binding of specific DNA sequences. However, little is known about the mechanisms whereby DNA bound receptors regulate transcription. In the present study, we examined the effects of thyroid hormone receptor (TR) binding on DNA conformation using various TR recognition sites contained within sets of circularly permuted flanking sequences. We show that under conditions where TR binds predominantly as monomer, the conformation of a number of binding sites is changed in a manner consistent with receptor induced bending. Despite similar affinities for receptor binding, not all binding sites tested showed evidence for receptor-induced bending. Notably, the conformation of a sequence from the frog vitellogenin 2 gene, which confers a positive transcriptional response when bound by estrogen receptor (ER), but a negative response when bound by TR, appeared to be unaffected by binding of either TR or ER. The observations suggest that the ability of the receptor to alter DNA architecture is strongly dependent on sequence characteristics other than those required for receptor binding. While both partly purified TR from rat liver and TR translated in vitro were able to induce DNA bending, the bend centers and bend angles produced by these different sources of receptor differed. However, addition of a receptor-depleted fraction from the rat liver TR preparation to in vitro translated receptor stimulated TR binding and appeared to form heterodimers with TR. This resulted in changes in both bend centers and bend angles to resemble more closely those produced by native receptor. Together, these results suggest that receptor-induced DNA bending may be specific to TRs and that the position and degree of bending is further modulated by the formation of heterodimers between TRs and accessory protein(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1605585451,"The molluscan cardioexcitatory tetrapeptide FMRF-amide (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2) and related peptides inhibit Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange in calf cardiac sarcolemma vesicles. FMRFa itself has a low inhibitory potency (IC50 = 750 microM) which completely resides in its COOH-terminal RFa portion. The physiologically active analog FLRFa is 10-fold more potent (IC50 = 60 microM). Two other substitutions of the Met2 in FMRFa, by either Ile or Lys increase inhibitory potency 7- and 50-fold, respectively. The inhibitory potency increases 300-500-fold if the NH2-terminal Phe1 in FMRFa is substituted by either Val or His (IC50 = 1-2 microM). The inhibitory activity of WnLRFa (IC50 = 40 microM) is lost when either the NH2-terminal amino group is acylated or the NH2-terminal Trp1 is deleted. These data suggest that the COOH-terminal portion is essential for the basic low potency inhibition of Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange, whereas the NH2-terminal portion is important for the potentiation of the inhibitory activity. Although the IC50 values of various peptides range widely (10(-6)-10(-3) M), all of them induce a complete inhibition. The dose-response pattern of the peptide-induced inhibition is identical for the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange and its partial reaction, the Ca(2+)-Ca2+ exchange. The inhibitory effect is reversible and affects both Nai(or Cai)-dependent 45Ca uptake and Nao-dependent 45Ca efflux, suggesting that the bidirectional movements of ions are altered. A mild pretreatment of vesicles with trypsin augments the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange 1.5-fold but diminishes the inhibitory potency 3-4-fold, suggesting that the inhibition is mediated by an extravesicular membrane protein. The characteristics of the peptide-induced inhibition resemble the effect of opiates on Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange. FLRFa and dextrorphan (a non-opioid stereoisomer of an opiate agonist) are mutually exclusive inhibitors, suggesting that they may bind to the same site. This putative site lacks the pharmacological properties of opiate receptors and may be located either on the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger or at its vicinity. Endogenous analogs of FMRFa may regulate intracellular calcium via Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange."
https://openalex.org/W1505648868,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (Nmt1p) is an essential enzyme that transfers myristate from CoA to the amino-terminal glycine residue of at least 12 cellular proteins. Its reaction mechanism is Ordered Bi Bi with myristoyl-CoA binding occurring before binding of nascent polypeptides and release of CoA preceding release of the myristoylprotein product. nmt1-72 is a temperature-sensitive allele, identified by Stone et al. (Stone, D. E., Cole, G. M., Lopes, M. B., Goebl, M., and Reed, S. I. (1991) Genes & Dev. 5, 1969-1981) that causes arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle due to reduced acylation of Gpa1p. We have recovered this mutant allele and determined that it contains a single point mutation resulting in a Leu99 (CTA) to Pro (CCA) substitution. Addition of > or = 500 microM myristate but not palmitate to synthetic or rich media rescues the growth arrest caused by nmt1-72 at 37-39 degrees C, consistent with the observation that purified nmt72p has reduced affinity for myristoyl-CoA and that exogenous myristate but not palmitate increases cellular myristoyl-CoA pools. Metabolic labeling studies in S. cerevisiae and co-expression of nmt72p with several protein substrates of Nmt1p in Escherichia coli indicate that the Leu99-->Pro substitution causes a reduction in the acylation of some but not all protein substrates. Since formation of a myristoyl-CoA.Nmt1p complex appears to be required for synthesis/formation of a peptide binding site, these defects in acylation appear to arise either because Leu99 is a component of the enzyme's functionally distinguishable myristoyl-CoA and peptide recognition sites or because Pro99 alters the interaction between myristoyl-CoA and enzyme in a way that precludes formation of a normal peptide binding site. The reduction in affinity for myristoyl-CoA produced by Leu99-->Pro in nmt72p is less than that produced by the Gly451-->Asp mutation in nmt181p, which also produces temperature-sensitive myristic acid auxotrophy. Isogenic, haploid strains containing NMT1, nmt1-72, and nmt1-181 do not manifest any obvious differences in steady state levels of the acyltransferases during growth at permissive temperatures or in the biosynthesis of long chain saturated acyl-CoAs. The spectrum of cellular N-myristoylproteins whose level of acylation is affected by nmt1-72 and nmt1-181 is distinct.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

A novel sulfotransferase (ST) from rat brain which catalyzes the terminal step in the biosynthesis in vitro of SGGLs is described. The enzyme catalyzes a transfer of sulfate from 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate to a hydroxyl group on carbon 3 of the terminal glucuronyl residue in IV3 beta-glucuronyl neolactotetraosylceramide (GlcAnLcOse4Cer) and VI3 beta-glucuronyl neolactohexaosylceramide (GlcAnLcOse6Cer) to form 3-sulfated glucuronyl glycolipids. The enzyme is highly specific for glucuronylglycolipids (GGLs) and requires the free-COOH group of the terminal glucuronic acid for reactivity. GGL:ST present in the microsomal membranes requires Mn2+ ions and a nonionic detergent, Triton X-100 for activity. The optimal pH is 7.2 with Tris-HCl buffer and Km values were 7 microM for 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate and 29 microM for GlcAnLcOse4Cer. GGL:ST was shown to be different from previously well studied galactocerebroside:sulfotransferase for the synthesis of myelin membrane-specific lipid sulfatide. This conclusion was based upon several criteria, i.e. including different requirements of incubation conditions for maximal activity, substrate competition experiments, different effects of heat, dithiothreitol, NaCl, and pyridoxal phosphate, as well as different profiles of expression of activity during development of the nervous tissues. The two enzymes were also partially resolved on a pyridoxal phosphate-ligated agarose column. Studies on the developmental expression of the GGL:ST in the rat cerebral cortex and cerebellum showed that it is not a regulatory enzyme controlling the expression of SGGLs in these neural tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1593225318,"Cumene hydroperoxide (CuOOH)-mediated inactivation of cytochromes P450 (P450) results in the degradation of their prosthetic heme to products that alkylate the apoprotein. Indirect approaches suggest that this alkylation occurs at the active site. in order to identify the specific apoprotein site(s) alkylated, purified 3H- or 14C-heme-labeled P450 2B1 was incubated with CuOOH and subjected to lysyl endopeptidase-C digestion. Two major peaks (L1 and L2) containing 3H- or 14C-labeled peptides were detected by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography of the digest. L1 contained the highest specific radioactivity and after Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis yielded 3 peptide bands (M(r) approximately 3,500 (P1), 5,000 (P2), and 7,000 (P3)). Although all 3 bands were found radiolabeled, the yield of P1 was higher than that of P2 or P3. Amino acid sequence analysis of the first 13 N-terminal residues of P1 revealed the sequence RICLGEGIARNEL, corresponding to residues 434-446 of the reported 2B1 sequence. A species with the molecular mass of 3771 +/- 1 Da was detected in preliminary electrospray mass spectrometric analysis of L1. Since the theoretical average mass of the predicted peptide (residues 434-466) is 3721.99 Da, the additional 49 +/- 1 Da are considered to be contributed by the alkylating heme fragment. This alkylated 2B1 sequence contains not only Cys436, the conserved residue that provides the SH ligand for heme, but also other highly conserved residues, and therefore corresponds to the heme-sandwiching helix L of P450cam. To our knowledge, this is the first report to localize CuOOH-induced heme alkylation of 2B1 to its active site."

https://openalex.org/W1590679083,"Ferricyanide oxidation of the aryl-iron complexes formed by the reaction of cytochrome P450 enzymes with arylhydrazines causes in situ migration of the aryl group from the iron to the porphyrin nitrogen atoms. The regiochemistry of this migration, defined by the ratio of the four possible N-arylprotoporphyrin IX isomers, provides a method for mapping the topologies of cytochrome P450 active sites. The method has been validated by using it to examine the active site of cytochrome P450cam (CYP101), for which a crystal structure is available. In agreement with the crystal structure, reaction with phenylhydrazine gives a 5:25:70 ratio of the NA:NC:ND (subscript indicates pyrrole ring) N-phenylprotoporphyrin IX isomers. Naphthylhydrazine, however, yields exclusively the NC regioisomer and 4-(phenyl)phenylhydrazine the NA:NC:ND isomers in a 14:40:46 ratio. These isomer ratio differences are readily explained by topological differences between the upper and lower reaches of the active site. Having validated the aryl-iron shift as a topological probe, we used it to investigate the structural changes caused by mutation of Phe-87, a residue that provides the ceiling over pyrrole ring D in the crystal structure of cytochrome P450cam. Mutation of Phe-87 to a tryptophan causes no detectable change in the regiochemistry of camphor hydroxylation and only minor changes in the N-aryl isomer ratios. However, mutation of Phe-87 to an alanine, which was expected to open up the region above pyrrole ring D, severely decreased the proportion of the ND in favor of the NA isomer. Less rather than more space is therefore available over pyrrole ring D in the F87A mutant despite the fact that the regiochemistry of camphor hydroxylation remains unchanged. These results provide evidence for significant structural reorganization in the upper regions of the substrate binding site without alteration of the camphor hydroxylation regiospecificity in the F87A mutant."
https://openalex.org/W1554134962,"Biological activities of many of the eukaryotic DNA replication proteins are modulated by protein phosphorylation. Investigations of the phosphorylation of adenovirus DNA polymerase (AdPol) have been difficult mainly because of its low level of synthesis in adenovirus-infected HeLa cells. However, when AdPol was overproduced using the recombinant vaccinia virus (RV-AdPol) and the baculovirus expression systems, or by a large scale metabolic labeling of adenovirus 2-infected HeLa cells (native AdPol), in vivo phosphorylation of AdPol could be demonstrated. Phosphoamino acid analysis of [32P]AdPol indicated the presence of phosphoserine independent of the source of AdPol. Comparison of tryptic peptide maps of native AdPol and RV-AdPol revealed that the majority of phosphopeptides were common. Fractionation by high performance liquid chromatography and sequencing of one of the major phosphopeptides revealed serine 67 as a site of phosphorylation. Interestingly, this site is located close to the nuclear localization signal of AdPol and has a consensus substrate recognition sequence for histone H1 (cdc2-related) kinases and mitogen-activated protein kinases. Dephosphorylation of AdPol with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase resulted in significant decrease in its activity in the in vitro DNA replication initiation assay, suggesting that phosphorylation is important for its biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W1586798724,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae KEX1 gene encodes a protease with carboxypeptidase B-like activity involved in K1 and K2 killer toxins and alpha-factor (mating pheromone) precursors processing. The gene has been expressed using the baculovirus/insect cell system, and the KEX1 encoded protein (Kex1p) was purified to apparent homogeneity from detergent-solubilized membrane preparations of insect cells infected with the recombinant virus. The specific activity of the enzyme was enriched 126-fold as compared with the cell lysate, with a recovery of 29%. The NH2-terminal sequence of the purified active enzyme was identical to the predicted sequence after the removal of the signal peptide. This provides evidence that Kex1p, at least in insect cells, is not made as a proenzyme. The optimum pH for activity was 6.0, and the apparent pI value of the protein was below pH 3.0. The enzyme cleaves arginine or lysine from the COOH terminus of synthetic peptides: benzoyl-Phe-Ala-Arg (Km = 284 microM), furylacryloyl (fa)-Ala-Arg (Km = 516 microM), and fa-Ala-Lys (Km = 962 microM). The kinetic data obtained reveals that Kex1p preferentially cleaves the COOH-terminal arginine of peptides over the COOH-terminal lysine. Insect-derived Kex1p processes alpha-factor-Lys-Arg, its known natural substrate, to mature active alpha-factor, and this maturation event takes place in a sequential manner. Furthermore, the enzyme expresses very high affinity for the 15-amino acid-long peptide, alpha-factor-Lys-Arg (Ki = 22 microM), and somewhat lower affinity for the heptapeptides [Leu]enkephalin-Arg-Arg,-Arg-Lys, and [Met]enkephalin-Lys-Lys (Ki = 45, 57, and 81 microM, respectively). The data demonstrate that processing at the COOH terminus of the peptides tested stops after the cleavage of the Arg and/or Lys residues. The specificity of the enzyme for COOH-terminal basic amino acid residues of the peptides used in this study and its high affinity for alpha-factor-Lys-Arg confirms the role that Kex1p plays in polypeptide precursor processing in yeast."

https://openalex.org/W1551622522,"The chromatin structure of the wound-inducible proteinase inhibitor I gene was investigated in nuclei from leaves of wounded and unwounded tomato plants. DNase I digestion of intact nuclei revealed that the inhibitor I chromatin structure was highly sensitive to the enzyme compared to the inactive ribosomal chromatin. This sensitivity was independent of wounding. Digestion of tomato nuclei with micrococcal nuclease, which produces a nucleosomal ladder from bulk chromatin in agarose gels, supported these observations. Micrococcal nuclease produced only a faint nucleosomal repeat superimposed on a smear for the coding region of the inhibitor I gene, whereas digestion of inactive ribosomal chromatin produced a well defined nucleosomal ladder. Two DNase I-hypersensitive sites were found in the promoter region of the inhibitor I gene. Both were present before and after wound induction. These two constitutive DNase I-hypersensitive sites may correspond to DNA regulatory regions of the gene. The combined results indicate the existence of an open chromatin conformation in the inhibitor I gene DNA region, present before gene induction by wounding."
https://openalex.org/W1663808770,"Abstract Rat liver microsomal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (HMGR) is extremely sensitive to oxidative inactivation by low concentrations (micromolar) of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) even in the presence of millimolar concentrations of glutathione (GSH). Inactivation involves the formation of an intramolecular protein-SS-protein disulfide in thiol/disulfide redox equilibrium with the reduced, active enzyme (Cappel, R.E., and Gilbert, H.F. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 12204-12212). In the absence of dithiothreitol, HMGR oxidation has been previously shown to cross-link the microsomal enzyme into a covalent dimer (Ness, G.C., McCreery, M.J., Sample, C.E., Smith, M., and Pendelton, L.C. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 12391-12393). Examination of the extent of HMGR cross-linking and residual HMGR activity in microsomes equilibrated with glutathione redox buffers establishes that inactivation and cross-linking result from oxidation of different dithiol pairs. The thiol/disulfide oxidation potential (K(ox)) for the oxidative inactivation of HMGR, E(SH)2,active + GSSG E(S-S)inactive + 2 GSH, is 0.67 +/- 0.07 M. However, the equilibrium constant for HMGR cross-linking, E(SH)2,monomer + GSS E(S-S)dimer + 2 GSH, is 0.19 +/- 0.02 M, significantly lower than that for inactivation (p < 0.001). Because of the significantly different oxidation potentials and the lack of a linear relationship between cross-linking and inactivation, the two processes must involve two different sets of vicinal dithiols. HMGR becomes 5-10-fold more difficult to oxidize in the presence of saturating levels of the substrate, HMG-CoA. Both inactivation and cross-linking exhibit significantly lower oxidation potentials in the presence of this substrate, 0.072 +/- 0.01 and 0.047 +/- 0.007 M, respectively. The decrease in oxidation potential caused by substrate binding is observed for both inactivation and cross-linking, showing that both processes are affected by the binding of substrate to the enzyme. The dithiols involved in HMGR subunit cross-linking are 2-3-fold more difficult to oxidize than the dithiols that affect the enzyme activity. Thus, the observation of partial cross-linking of HMGR in vivo would imply that conditions are sufficiently oxidizing to result in significant enzyme inactivation. The extreme thermodynamic sensitivity of HMGR to oxidative inactivation and cross-linking in glutathione redox buffers that span the physiological redox state implies that thiol/disulfide redox state changes could provide a mechanism for regulating the activity and/or stability of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1544470103,"A positive element between positions -924 and -851 and a negative element between -851 and -762 of the 5'-upstream region of the alpha-myosin heavy chain gene were identified through transient transfection assays in primary cultures of neonatal rat heart cells. Subsequent DNase I protection analysis revealed almost identical footprints at two positions (GAAAAATCT at -904 to -896 and GAAAATCT at -823 to -816). We have designated this sequence the GArC motif (for G,AT-rich,C). Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated the formation of specific complexes with GArC oligomers when either rat heart, rat liver, or HeLa cell nuclear extracts were used. Competition studies with unlabeled GArC oligomers resulted in a loss of binding. Oligomers were also made to the Xenopus cytoskeletal actin serum response element and to a segment of the alpha-MyHC gene (AT-core), each with a similar AT-rich core sequence. No detectable loss of binding resulted from the addition of an excess of either of these unlabeled oligomers. Southwestern blot analysis identified several proteins which interacted with the GArC element, suggesting the presence of a group of related trans-acting factors. Analysis of a sequence in the beta-MyHC gene with the same AT-rich core was negative, suggesting a role for the bases surrounding the protected area in binding. We propose that the GArC motif, together with its associated trans-acting factor(s), provides a novel mechanism of transcriptional control in addition to those previously reported for the cardiac myosin heavy chain genes."
https://openalex.org/W1605514634,"The kinetics of tropolone methyl ether binding to tubulin were measured by following the loss of colchicine binding capacity upon preincubation of tubulin with tropolone methyl ether. At 25 degrees C a bimolecular association rate constant of 2.7 (+/- 0.2) M-1 min-1 was determined, and from the temperature dependence an activation energy of 37 (+/- 8) kJ.mol-1 was calculated. By displacement experiments a dissociation rate constant of 2.9 (+/- 0.6) x 10(-2) min-1 was determined at 25 degrees C. The effect of 3',4',5'-trimethoxyacetophenone (TMA) is 2-fold. TMA reduces the apparent association rate constant of colchicine, indicating that it equilibrates very rapidly and reversibly with the colchicine binding site. From this reduction the binding constant for TMA can be obtained. At 25 degrees C a value of 112 (+/- 13) M-1 is estimated. The binding of TMA is practically thermoneutral. Preincubation of tubulin with TMA over 30 min not only reduces the subsequent binding rate constant of colchicine but also the amplitude. This indicates that TMA also binds slowly in a second mode or site. Stopped-flow kinetic studies reveal that fast TMA binding competes for the initial binding of colchicine. From these results it is concluded that colchicine binds initially with its trimethoxybenzene ring and in a subsequent step with the tropolone ring."

Various metabolites of the blood cell were assayed for their effects on CTBP activity after heat and cold preincubation treatments.

The effects of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, and ATP were obtained at physiological concentrations. Three-carbon phosphorylated intermediates of glycolysis, ADP, AMP, cAMP, and GTP had no effect on cold and heat treatments. The monomer-tetramer interconversion of the enzyme was also regulated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and ATP. The association is under the control of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, whereas the dissociation is under ATP control.

https://openalex.org/W1601961522,"Veratryl alcohol- and H2O2-dependent production of oxygen by lignin peroxidase isozyme H2 (LiPH2) from Phanerochaete chrysosporium was investigated. Veratryl alcohol oxidation by LiPH2 decreased with increasing concentrations of H2O2 while oxygen evolution increased. The absorption spectrum of the LiPH2 in these experiments indicated that it was in the compound II state. We propose that O2 production results from the one electron oxidation of H2O2 by the veratryl alcohol cation radical to yield superoxide, as the addition of superoxide dismutase stimulated oxygen production. It has been reported previously that oxygen is consumed in reaction mixtures containing lignin peroxidase, H2O2, veratryl alcohol, and oxalate (Popp, J. L., Kalyanaraman, B., and Kirk, T.K. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 10475-10480). In the presence of oxalate, we observed oxygen consumption that was dependent on the H2O2 concentration. The ability of other methoxybenzenes to mediate oxygen production appeared to be related to their redox potential. It was concluded that cation radicals can oxidize H2O2 by one electron which results in the production of superoxide and the evolution of molecular oxygen. Thus, the rates of LiPH2-catalyzed O2 consumption or O2 production are dependent on the relative concentrations of H2O2 and oxalate."
https://openalex.org/W1680196738,"Abstract Each strand transfer catalyzed by the Flp recombinase is the composite of two transesterification reactions. The active nucleophilic species in the two reactions are the catalytic tyrosine (Tyr-343) of Flp and the 5'-hydroxyl from the Flp-nicked DNA substrate, respectively. A half recombination site is capable of undergoing this pair of transesterifications in the presence of Flp. When the substrate is a half-site containing a chiral phosphorothioate at the exchange point, the Flp reaction yields a product in which the phosphate chirality is retained. A mutant of Flp that lacks the active tyrosine, Flp(Y343F), is incapable of mediating strand transfer in a full-recombination but can execute strand transfer in a half-site. The efficiency of this reaction is about 2% of that of the wild type reaction. The activity of Flp(Y343F) is critically dependent on the length of the half-site spacer. Furthermore, in this reaction, the strand cleavage and strand exchange steps cannot be uncoupled. These results strongly suggest a direct attack by the 5'-hydroxyl of the half-site spacer on the phosphodiester at the normal strand transfer point."
https://openalex.org/W1539481103,"The elongation factor G (EF-G) is responsible for the translocation of the ribosome along the mRNA chain. Under in vitro conditions, EF-G exhibits a very active uncoupled GTPase activity which is dependent on the presence of ribosomes and is modulated by mRNA-dependent binding of tRNA. In the absence of tRNA, uncoupled EF-G GTPase is inhibited by initiation factors IF1 and IF3, but not by initiation factor IF2. In the presence of N-fMet-tRNAfMet and poly(A,U,G) or in the presence of N-acetyl-Phe-tRNAPhe and poly(U), initiation factor IF2 causes an additional decrease of the uncoupled EF-G GTPase activity. This effect, however, is dependent on the presence of IF1 and IF3 and is obviously due to the mRNA- and initiation factor-dependent binding of N-fMet-tRNAfMet and N-acetyl-Phe-tRNAPhe, respectively, to the ribosomal P-site. Non-enzymatic binding of N-fMet-tRNAfMet and N-acetyl-Phe-tRNAPhe, however, causes a stimulation of uncoupled EF-G GTPase activity. The same effects are observed for Met-tRNA, Phe-tRNAPhe and uncharged tRNA. These findings are discussed in the light of the three-site model of the ribosome and the mechanism of translocation."

AcChE aliquots were digested with trypsin and fractionated by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. Inactivation caused a decrease in one absorption peak and an increase in another, identified as the peptide beginning at Ala-222 and extending to Arg-242. 5-Trimethylammonio-2-pentanone, a competitive inhibitor, isosteric with acetylcholine, retarded the inactivation and decreased the quantity of labeled peptide. On sequencing, the 14C label was found associated with Cys-231.
