https://openalex.org/W1527527962,"Abstract One of the two l-asparaginases from anaerobically grown Escherichia coli K-12 was released into the surrounding medium both during the formation of spheroplasts by treatment with lysozyme and ethylenediaminetetraacetate and following osmotic shock. This enzyme, asparaginase II, has previously been shown to be active against the growth of mouse lymphomas and to be an effective inhibitor of cell-free protein synthesis in microbial extracts. In the present communication osmotic shock has been used as the first step in the purification of asparaginase II. The other enzyme, asparaginase I, was not liberated from the cells."

https://openalex.org/W1972092561,"A method of extracting polyribosomes has been developed which uses lysozyme on bacteria in the exponential phase of growth. This procedure recovers more than 80 percent of the total ribonucleic acid and nearly all of the soluble protein. Analysis of the lysate on sucrose gradients shows that 80 to 90 percent of the ribosomes sediment with the polysome fractions, indicating little or no degradation. The method has been applied to both a Gram-positive and a Gram-negative organism under various growth conditions and has proved uniformly successful."

Previous reports indicated that the receptive area on the skin of such preparations was a single small spot less than 1 millimeter in diameter. However, we found that the activity in a single thermally sensitive fiber increased when any one of eight individual spots on the skin was cooled. In other preparations two to six spots, each less than 1 millimeter in diameter, appeared to be innervated by a single fiber. The neural activity resulting from the cooling of one or several of these spots summed, and we suggest that this summation may be the neural analog of areal summation of thermal stimuli reported in psychophysical measurements."

https://openalex.org/W2057407825,Single unit activity was recorded from the frontal eye fields (area 8) in unanesthetized monkeys seated in a primate chair with the head restrained. The frontal eye field units were identified by antidromic response to stimulation of the cerebral peduncle. The findings indicate that most of the neurons discharge only after initiation of eye movements. These cells showed steady discharge when the eyes were immobile and oriented in a specific direction.

https://openalex.org/W1514051752,Abstract A diaminopimelic acid auxotroph of Bacillus megaterium was shown to accumulate N-acetyl-l-diaminopimelic acid. Extracts prepared from cultures of the parental strain contain N-acetyl-l-diaminopimelic acid deacylase but this enzyme was absent in extracts prepared from the mutant. Apparently acetate is used as the blocking group in diaminopimelate biosynthesis in B. megaterium in contrast to succinate which has the analogous function in Escherichia coli.

https://openalex.org/W2419611467,"The effects of insulin and Bacillus subtilis protease, Type VIII (Subtilopeptidase A, EC 3.4.4.16) on the conversion by isolated adipose cells of extracellular glucose to CO2, fatty acids, and glyceride-glycerol, and of extracellular palmitic acid to CO2 and cell triglyceride have been compared. The protease was found to simulate insulin action by (a) stimulation of glucose uptake and of oxidation of glucose carbon 1 via the pentose pathway; (b) stimulation of fatty acid synthesis from glucose; (c) causing still greater utilization of glucose (oxidation and lipogenesis) in the presence of palmitic acid; (d) enhancement of the carrier-mediated, stereospecific transport for glucose; and by (e) causing decreased oxidation and increased esterification of extracellular palmitic acid in the presence of glucose. Similar effects were observed with trypsin, α-chymotrypsin, and Streptomyces griseus protease Type VI. It is suggested that these insulin-like effects may in part be due to a limited modification of plasma membranes caused by proteolytic processes."

https://openalex.org/W4243967441,"THE term “endotoxin” is used to denote the lipopolysaccharides of high molecular weight (1 million or above) which are considered to be integral structural units of the cell walls of Gram negative bacteria1. The conventional method of preparing endotoxin is by chemical extraction from intact cells (or cell walls) using, for instance, trichloroacetic acid at 4° C (ref. 2), 45 per cent aqueous phenol at 65°–68° C (ref. 3), or mixtures of ether and water at 6°–12° C (ref. 4). Heterogeneous extracts are obtained which may require extensive purification before they yield the final homogeneous product5."

This condition is accompanied by a marked decrease in the size of the kidneys, with progressive diminution of renal function, as shown by measurements of creatinine and urea clearance."

In a recent review of spontaneous malignant tumours in non-human primates, Kent2 reported forty-nine cases in eighteen species, but none were found in Alouatta. Houser et al.3 have found benign adrenal adenomas in Alouatta villosa of Panama."

https://openalex.org/W2010895329,"Thirteen normal monkeys (Macaca mulatta) trained to discriminate between transilluminated figures of equal area and different luminance, and consequently different luminous flux, made similar numbers of errors during training on a new problem with the same luminance values but with targets equated for luminous flux. These findings together with results of ""critical trials"" suggest that the significant cue in the original problem was luminous flux. This behavior is strikingly similar to what has been reported for the monkey following exclusion of the geniculostriate system."

https://openalex.org/W2059711199,"Intracellular recordings of archicortical neurons in a primate have been made and the responses of these neurons in awake, sitting animals have been observed. Electrical stimulation of the olfactory bulbs elicits excitatory postsynaptic potentials in these neurons, which unlike those evoked by septal stimulation, are subliminal for generating spikes. The olfactory and septal pathways may be considered representative of inputs from exteroceptive and interoceptive systems. The findings are discussed in relation to a paradigm for archicortical conditioning."

https://openalex.org/W2009477849,"THE rat adapted strain of Babesia (Nuttallia) rodhaini obtained from Miss E. Beveridge of the Wellcome Laboratories of Tropical Medicine, produces 20 per cent to 30 per cent parasitaemia on about day 7, followed by recovery, when passaged from mice to normal young rats. When maintained in rats, parasitaemias of 50 per cent to 60 per cent on about day 7 result, and some deaths occur. I have found that immunizing rats against certain tissues of normal mice protects them from B. rodhaini maintained in mice, but not from B. rodhaini maintained in rats. When the parasite was passaged from mice to rats immunized against uninfected mouse tissues, thirteen out of fifteen showed no patent parasitaemias, and the other two each showed a single parasite in 10,000 erythrocytes on the fourth day only. The thirteen harboured sub-patent infections on day 28, because sub-inoculations made into clean mice were positive for Babesia."
