The method involves the coupling of glucokinase with an exogenous source of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and measurement of TPN+ reduction in the Beckman spectrophotometer at 340 rnp. The specific activity of this soluble glucokinase is sufficiently high to account for previous estimates of glucose phosphorylation in liver slices and for the high rate of glycogen synthesis in the in- tact rat. Fasting or alloxan diabetes caused a lowering of he- patic glucokinase activity on a per g liver basis to about 400/, of the value for normal, fed rats. REFERENCES 1. RENOLD, A. E., HASTINGS, A.

https://openalex.org/W1974187356,Comparative chemical analyses show the aqueous humor of smooth dogfish has lower concentrations of urea and trimethylamine oxide than the blood plasma. Freezing-point depression determinations demonstrate that the aqueous humor has a correspondingly lower osmotic pressure. It would appear that water entering the aqueous humor from the plasma is moving against an osmotic gradient.

The existence of a parietal nerve must be considered in interpreting the effects of parietalectomy."

The three genotypes may be designated gamma(I)/gamma(I), gamma(II)/gamma(II), and gamma(I)/gamma(II)."

https://openalex.org/W2012678798,"SUPPORTING membranes with holes are usually used for testing the axial astigmatism of the objective lens in electron microscopy. In the case of specimens which are difficult to focus they facilitate the focusing. Supporting membranes with a large percentage of open area are of great advantage for mounting thin sections, because the gain in contrast is considerable1. It applies also to specimens for testing the resolving power of the electron microscope or high-resolution work, when a very thin film of collodion can be mounted on these perforated membranes2. The holes will then enable not only the focusing but also a continuous control of the axial astigmatism. Several methods for obtaining holes in supporting membranes have been described3–5. Mostly ‘Formvar’ film is used; but to obtain reproducible results the methods are relatively complicated."
