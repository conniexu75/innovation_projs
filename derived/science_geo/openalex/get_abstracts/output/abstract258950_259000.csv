https://openalex.org/W2072923279,"Graphene — a recently isolated one-atom-thick layered form of graphite — is a hot topic in the materials science and condensed matter physics communities, where it is proving to be a popular model system for investigation. An experiment involving individual graphene sheets suspended over a microscale scaffold has allowed structure determination using transmission electron microscopy and diffraction, perhaps paving the way towards an answer to the question of why graphene can exist at all. The 'two-dimensional' sheets, it seems, are not flat, but wavy. The undulations are less pronounced in a two-layer system, and disappear in multilayer samples. Learning more about this 'waviness' may reveal what makes these extremely thin carbon membranes so stable. Investigations of individual graphene sheets freely suspended on a microfabricated scaffold in vacuum or in air reveal that the membranes are not perfectly flat, but exhibit an intrinsic waviness, such that the surface normal varies by several degrees, and out-of-plane deformations reach 1 nm. The recent discovery of graphene has sparked much interest, thus far focused on the peculiar electronic structure of this material, in which charge carriers mimic massless relativistic particles1,2,3. However, the physical structure of graphene—a single layer of carbon atoms densely packed in a honeycomb crystal lattice—is also puzzling. On the one hand, graphene appears to be a strictly two-dimensional material, exhibiting such a high crystal quality that electrons can travel submicrometre distances without scattering. On the other hand, perfect two-dimensional crystals cannot exist in the free state, according to both theory and experiment4,5,6,7,8,9. This incompatibility can be avoided by arguing that all the graphene structures studied so far were an integral part of larger three-dimensional structures, either supported by a bulk substrate or embedded in a three-dimensional matrix1,2,3,9,10,11,12. Here we report on individual graphene sheets freely suspended on a microfabricated scaffold in vacuum or air. These membranes are only one atom thick, yet they still display long-range crystalline order. However, our studies by transmission electron microscopy also reveal that these suspended graphene sheets are not perfectly flat: they exhibit intrinsic microscopic roughening such that the surface normal varies by several degrees and out-of-plane deformations reach 1 nm. The atomically thin single-crystal membranes offer ample scope for fundamental research and new technologies, whereas the observed corrugations in the third dimension may provide subtle reasons for the stability of two-dimensional crystals13,14,15."

https://openalex.org/W1988829538,"Graphene -a recently discovered one-atom-thick layer of graphite- constitutes a new model system in condensed matter physics, because it is the first material in which charge carriers behave as massless chiral relativistic particles. The anomalous quantization of the Hall conductance, which is now understood theoretically, is one of the experimental signatures of the peculiar transport properties of relativistic electrons in graphene. Other unusual phenomena, like the finite conductivity of order 4e^2/h at the charge neutrality (or Dirac) point, have come as a surprise and remain to be explained. Here, we study the Josephson effect in graphene. Our experiments rely on mesoscopic superconducting junctions consisting of a graphene layer contacted by two closely spaced superconducting electrodes, where the charge density can be controlled by means of a gate electrode. We observe a supercurrent that, depending on the gate voltage, is carried by either electrons in the conduction band or by holes in the valence band. More importantly, we find that not only the normal state conductance of graphene is finite, but also a finite supercurrent can flow at zero charge density. Our observations shed light on the special role of time reversal symmetry in graphene and constitute the first demonstration of phase coherent electronic transport at the Dirac point."

We have examined its reactivity with various biological oxidants, in order to assess its ability to act as a direct physiological target for these species. Human erythrocyte peroxiredoxin 2 was oxidized stoichiometrically to its disulfide-bonded homodimer by hydrogen peroxide, as monitored electrophoretically under nonreducing conditions. The protein was highly susceptible to oxidation by adventitious peroxide, which could be prevented by treating buffers with low concentrations of catalase. However, this did not protect peroxiredoxin 2 against oxidation by added H2O2. Experiments measuring inhibition of dimerization indicated that at pH 7.4 catalase and peroxiredoxin 2 react with hydrogen peroxide at comparable rates. A rate constant of 1.3 × 107 m-1 s-1 for the peroxiredoxin reaction was obtained from competition kinetic studies with horseradish peroxidase. This is 100-fold faster than is generally assumed. It is sufficiently high for peroxiredoxin to be a favored cellular target for hydrogen peroxide, even in competition with catalase or glutathione peroxidase. Reactions of t-butyl and cumene hydroperoxides with peroxiredoxin were also fast, but amino acid chloramines reacted much more slowly. This contrasts with other thiol compounds that react many times faster with chloramines than with hydrogen peroxide. The alkylating agent iodoacetamide also reacted extremely slowly with peroxiredoxin 2. These results demonstrate that peroxiredoxin 2 has a tertiary structure that facilitates reaction of the active site thiol with hydrogen peroxide while restricting its reactivity with other thiol reagents.

Human peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2) 3The abbreviations used are: Prx2, peroxiredoxin 2; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; IAM, iodoacetamide. and other members of the peroxiredoxin superfamily catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides through the oxidation and subsequent reduction of cysteine residues (1Netto L.E.S.

Med. 2005; 38: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). The initial step in the catalytic cycle is oxidation of Cys-50 (designated the peroxidatic cysteine, CP) to a sulfenic acid, which reacts with Cys-171 (the resolving cysteine, CR) of another subunit. The result is a disulfide-bonded homodimer of the two subunits linked in a head to tail manner. Physiologically, the catalytic action of Prx2 is understood to involve reduction by thioredoxin, which is recycled by thioredoxin reductase and NADPH (Scheme 1) (3Kim J.A. Park S. Kim K. Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 338: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The disulfide bonds can also be reduced by low molecular weight reductants such as dithiothreitol (DTT). Peroxiredoxins can function as antioxidants by removing H2O2. They are also proposed to have a signaling role through the “floodgate” mechanism (4Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Science. 2003; 300: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar) whereby higher concentrations of H2O2 inactivate the protein by overoxidizing CP to the sulfinic acid (5Yang K.S. Kang S.W.

Chem. 2002; 277: 38029-38036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), thus enabling the peroxide to interact with other cell regulatory pathways. For these mechanisms to operate, the peroxiredoxin must react sufficiently rapidly with H2O2 to compete with other peroxide-metabolizing enzymes, in particular catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Prx2 is one of the predominant cytoplasmic peroxiredoxins in mammalian cells (6Chae H.Z. Kim H.J. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1999; 45: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). It is relatively abundant, with a concentration of ∼0.25 mm estimated for the erythrocyte (7Moore R.B. Mankad M.V. Shriver S.K. Mankad V.N. Plishker G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18964-18968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of Prx2 to break down peroxides catalytically has been demonstrated (6Chae H.Z. Kim H.J. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1999; 45: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), but absolute rates constants have not been measured. Based on kinetic measurements with microbial 2-Cys peroxiredoxins, rate constants for oxidation of the mammalian proteins by H2O2 are generally assumed to be in the 105 m-1 s-1 range (8Hofmann B. Hecht H.J. Flohe L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). In contrast, values for catalases and glutathione peroxidases are closer to 107 m-1 s-1. On this basis, even allowing for its cellular concentration being higher, it is debatable whether Prx2 would be able to compete efficiently with the other enzymes (8Hofmann B. Hecht H.J. Flohe L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Yet there are numerous mammalian cells or whole animal studies where antioxidant or signaling activity of Prx2 has been observed (9Moon E.Y. Han Y.H. Lee D.S. Han Y.M. Yu D.Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 2119-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Johnson R.M. Goyette Jr., G. Ravindranath Y. Ho Y.S. Free Radic. Biol.

Recently, AhpC, a 2-Cys peroxiredoxin from Salmonella typhimurium has been shown to react more rapidly with H2O2 than has been assumed, with a catalytic efficiency of 4 × 107 m-1 s-1 (13Parsonage D. Youngblood D.S. Sarma G.N. Wood Z.A. Karplus P.A. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10583-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is a clear need for more information on the human enzyme. Our objective was to determine the rate of reaction of human Prx2 with H2O2 and relate this to the reactivity of other peroxides, hypochlorous acid, and a range of chloramines. In undertaking this investigation, initial experiments were thwarted by an inability to remove reducing agents from isolated Prx2 and maintain it in a reduced form. Our study has revealed extreme sensitivity to H2O2 and other peroxides but surprisingly low reactivity with chloramines and resistance to alkylation of the catalytic thiols by iodoacetamide. We describe these findings along with kinetic studies that show that Prx2 reacts with H2O2 with a rate constant comparable with that of catalase. Sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, and ethanolamine were from BDH (Poole, UK). Micro Bio-Gel 6 columns were purchased from Bio-Rad. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and enhanced chemiluminescence plus Western blotting detection systems were from Amersham Biosciences. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Prx2 antibody was obtained from LabFrontier (Seoul, Korea). Goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and other chemicals were from Sigma. Peroxiredoxin 2 was purified from human erythrocytes obtained from freshly drawn heparinized blood, based on the method of Lim et al. (14Lim Y.S. Cha M.K. Yun C.H. Kim H.K. Kim K. Kim I.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Erythrocytes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, (PBS) and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.5 mm EDTA and 1 mm DTT. After centrifugation the lysate was treated with 30% ammonium sulfate, and the supernatant was dialyzed against lysis buffer and loaded onto a HiPrep 16/10 DEAE FF column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with this buffer to remove most of the hemoglobin, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear 0–250 mm NaCl gradient. Aliquots of the fractions were analyzed by electrophoresis and Western blotting for the presence of Prx2, and those containing relatively pure Prx2 were pooled. Based on silver-stained SDS gels, we estimate that isolated Prx2 was >90% pure. Purified protein gave a single monomer peak at an m/z ratio of 21,805 by electrospray mass spectrometry and had no detectable catalase activity. Thiol concentration was measured by reduction of 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) to 5-thio 2-nitro-benzoate (ϵ412 = 14100 m-1 cm-1) and revealed 2.8 mol of reduced thiols per mol of Prx2 in the presence of 0.1% SDS. Chloramines were prepared by adding HOCl to a 10-fold excess of the parent amino compound as described elsewhere (15Peskin A.V. Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Chloramine concentrations were determined with 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (16Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 502-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and H2O2 concentrations by measuring A240 (ϵ = 43.6 m-1 cm-1). In bovine liver (10,000 units/mg protein) and human erythrocyte (55,000 units/mg protein) catalases the heme content was determined by measuring absorption at 404 nm. On this basis, the bovine catalase showed 10% of the activity of the human form. Prior to each experiment, Prx2 was reduced by adding DTT and passed through a spin column pre-equilibrated with appropriate buffer. The Prx2 was treated with each oxidant at 20 °C in PBS unless stated otherwise. Indicated concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) were added after treatments to block remaining thiol groups prior to dilution in gel-loading buffer. Protein was analyzed by nonreducing 12% SDS-PAGE. Gels were either Coomassie- or silver-stained or were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blotted with an antibody against Prx2. A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was used to visualize the immunoblots through enhanced chemiluminescence. Stained gels were scanned using Fluor-S® MultiImager and immunoblots using ChemiDoc® XRS (Bio-Rad). Bands were quantified using Quantity One software from Bio-Rad. Prx2 ran either as a 21-kDa monomer (in the presence of DTT) or a reversibly oxidized dimer, with the same electrophoretic pattern observed for protein-stained gels (Fig. 1A) and anti-Prx2 blots (Fig. 1B). Both consistently showed two Prx2 dimer bands, with the lower becoming more prominent under more oxidizing conditions. We speculate that the two bands represent dimers with one and two disulfide bonds. The rate constant for reaction of Prx2 with H2O2 was determined by competition with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The peroxidase is converted by H2O2 to compound I, which in the absence of a reducing substrate remains stable under these conditions (17Ogusucu R. Rettori D. Munhoz D.C. Soares Netto L.E. Augusto O. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 42: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Spectra were recorded using a NanoDrop® spectrophotometer (Biolab Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). The concentration of HRP was determined by measuring A403 (ϵ403 = 1.02 × 105 m-1 cm-1), and the extent of conversion to compound I was monitored at 403 nm. Mass spectrometry was performed using an LCQ™ DECA XPplus ion trap instrument (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). The desalted protein sample was diluted 1:1 with acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid. Detergent was removed from samples containing SDS by extraction with chloroform/methanol/water (18Puchades M. Westman A. Blennow K. Davidsson P. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 13: 344-349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sample was directly infused using a Hamilton syringe at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. A full scan for the mass range 100–2000 m/z was monitored. Data were collected for 1 min before deconvolution using BioworksBrowser 3.1 SR1 (ThermoFinnigan). Prx2 Oxidation by H2O2 Present in Buffers—To study the reactivity of Prx2, it is imperative to maintain its free thiol groups in the absence of reducing agents. We initially attempted to reduce Prx2 with DTT and remove the DTT using spin columns. Immediate analysis by nonreducing SDS-PAGE showed that most protein in the eluate was present as the disulfide-bonded dimer (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 1), which was reduced to the monomer by addition of DTT (lane 2). The dimer was formed even if NEM was placed in the collection tube to alkylate the thiol groups of the protein (not shown), suggesting that oxidation was very rapid and could occur during passage through the matrix of the spin column. Dimerization was pH-dependent, with a transition at pH 5–6 below which the protein remained reduced (Fig. 1C). Inclusion of a small amount of catalase in the equilibration buffer for the spin column resulted in recovery of the majority of the Prx2 in the monomeric state (Fig. 2B, 1st lane). Protection was seen whether or not DTPA or desferrioxamine was added to inhibit metal-catalyzed oxidation. These results could be explained if Prx2 were highly sensitive to H2O2 and there were sufficient amounts present in the buffer to cause complete oxidation. This reaction involves the thiolate (19Winterbourn C.C. Metodiewa D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), which is consistent with it being favored at higher pH. High reactivity of H2O2 was observed for reduced Prx2 prepared in pH 5 buffer and adjusted to pH 7.4, with addition of H2O2 at a 1:2 mole ratio causing immediate dimerization of Prx2 (Fig. 2A). Notably, even with catalase present to maintain Prx2 as a monomer, stoichiometric dimerization was still observed (Fig. 2B, 2nd to 4th lanes). We conclude that the oxidant sensitivity of reduced Prx2 makes it vulnerable to adventitious H2O2 present in buffers. This is particularly relevant during passage of low concentrations through a spin column (or dialysis) where the protein comes into contact with a large volume of buffer. Applying higher quantities of Prx2 to the spin column resulted in recovery of more protein in reduced form (not shown), which is consistent with the available oxidant being limited. As it was impractical to use large amounts of protein for each of the following experiments, separation of Prx2 from DTT was performed in the presence of catalase for the remainder of the study. This yielded predominantly reduced monomer, although in some experiments dimer was present in the starting material. Prx2 Competes Efficiently with Catalase for H2O2—The ability of Prx2 to be oxidized in the presence of catalase (Fig. 2B) implies that its reaction rate with H2O2 may be greater than is generally considered. Competition reactions performed with catalase established that this is indeed the case. As shown in Fig. 3A, very high concentrations of bovine liver catalase were required to inhibit Prx2 oxidation by H2O2. Analysis of band intensities showed that oxidation of Prx2 (0.15 mg/ml; 6 μm) was 50% protected with ∼0.4 mg/ml (7 μm heme) catalase. Thus, both proteins reacted with H2O2 at comparable rates. In an analogous competition experiment with catalase from human erythrocytes (Fig. 3B), 50% protection was observed with ∼0.05 mg/ml (0.8 μm heme), indicating that Prx2 was about 8-fold less active than the human catalase preparation. These IC50 values are consistent with the 6-fold difference measured in specific activity of the catalase preparations (see “Experimental Procedures”), and with the second-order rate constants of 6 × 106 and 3 × 107 m-1 s-1 for reaction of H2O2 with ferric bovine and human catalase, respectively (20Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases.1st Ed. Wiley-VCH, New York1999: 439Google Scholar). These data imply a second-order rate constant for the reaction of Prx2 with H2O2 of ∼6 × 106 m-1 s-1. Determination of the Rate Constant for Reaction of Prx2 with H2O2 by Competition with Horseradish Peroxidase—To obtain a more accurate value for the Prx2 rate constant, we used the procedure of Ogusucu et al. (17Ogusucu R. Rettori D. Munhoz D.C. Soares Netto L.E. Augusto O. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 42: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and measured the ability of Prx2 to compete with HRP for H2O2 and inhibit conversion of the native enzyme to compound I. Compound I formation measured spectrally at 403 nm was progressively inhibited by increasing concentrations of Prx2 (Fig. 4). The fractional inhibition (F) was calculated for each Prx2 concentration, and values of {(F/(1 - F))}kHRP[HRP] s-1 were plotted against [Prx2] (Fig. 4, inset). Taking a value of 1.7 × 107 m-1 s-1 for kHRP, the slope of this line gave a second-order rate constant for the reaction of Prx2 with H2O2 of 1.3 × 107 m-1 s-1. Reactivity of Prx2 with Other Oxidants—Prx2 also reacted rapidly with organic hydroperoxides. Competition with HRP could not be used to obtain rates for these peroxides, but like H2O2, low concentrations of t-butyl hydroperoxide and cumene hydroperoxide caused rapid Prx2 dimerization within 20 s (Fig. 5). We also investigated Prx2 reactivity with HOCl and chloramines. HOCl is generated by the neutrophil enzyme myeloperoxidase and reacts with amine groups to form chloramines. Thiols are highly favored targets for both HOCl and chloramines, and generally react much faster with these oxidants than with H2O2. For example, rate constants for different chloramines reacting with reduced glutathione at pH 7.4 range from 100 to 700 m-1 s-1 compared with 0.9 m-1 s-1 for H2O2 (15Peskin A.V. Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 19Winterbourn C.C. Metodiewa D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 21Peskin A.V. Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 1252-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the reaction of Prx2 with glycine chloramine was slow. Dimerization was scarcely detectable at 5 min with 40 μm chloramine (not shown), and with 100 μm it required ∼20 min for completion (Fig. 6A). An estimate based on half the protein being oxidized by 100 μm glycine chloramine in 5–10 min gives a rate constant of ∼10 m-1 s-1, more than 20 times less than that for the equivalent reaction of reduced glutathione. The reactivity of Prx2 with other chloramines of varying size and charge was also examined (Fig. 6B). Histamine chloramine was more effective than glycine chloramine, whereas taurine chloramine was less effective. This is a similar order of reactivity to that seen with reduced glutathione and other low molecular weight thiols, but the absolute rates with Prx2 are all slower. The reactivity of monochloramine was strikingly higher than the other chloramines, with 3 μm causing complete dimerization within 5 min (Fig. 6B). The chloramines tested, apart from monochloramine, are charged. To probe the role of charge versus size on reactivity, we used the chloramine of ethanolamine, which is similar in size to glycine chloramine but uncharged. It oxidized Prx2 more rapidly than glycine chloramine but was not nearly as reactive as monochloramine (Fig. 6B). Prx2 was rapidly oxidized by HOCl (Fig. 6C), although a greater excess was required than with H2O2 (compare with Fig. 2). HOCl shows little discrimination between different thiols (15Peskin A.V. Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and this may be a result of all three thiols of Prx2 being oxidized equally. Alkylation of Prx2—Even though Prx2 is highly susceptible to oxidation by H2O2, we found it surprisingly resistant to alkylation. Prx2 was treated with various concentrations of iodoacetamide (IAM) at pH 7.4 in the presence of low concentrations of catalase to prevent oxidation and analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry (Fig. 7A). The untreated protein gave a single mass peak that was unchanged with 10 mm IAM (not shown). With 20 mm IAM, there was partial conversion to a species with addition of one acetamide group (mass increase of 57 Da) (Fig. 7B) which became the major species at 100 mm IAM (Fig. 7D). A peak representing protein with two alkylated thiols was not evident at IAM concentrations of 50 mm (Fig. 7C) and below. Notably, even with 100 mm IAM there was a substantial peak representing nonalkylated Prx2 and no peak corresponding to alkylation of all three Prx2 cysteine residues. It was possible to derivatize the three cysteines with 10 mm NEM (mass increase of 375 Da), although after 5 min the majority of the protein had two NEM adducts (mass increase of 250 Da; Fig. 7E). Both NEM and IAM, by forming covalent adducts with the thiol groups, should prevent oxidation of Prx2 to the dimer. This was investigated in the presence of DTT but no catalase by measuring oxidation because of endogenous peroxide in the buffer. There was no dimerization when either NEM (Fig. 8A) or IAM (Fig. 8B) was added at a lower concentration than the DTT. However, with a slight excess of each, dimerization was evident. It became inhibited with high concentrations of NEM but not IAM. These results can be explained by both agents reacting faster with DTT than the Prx2 thiols. Once the DTT is blocked, dimer accumulates because of oxidation by adventitious H2O2. High concentrations of NEM can prevent this by outcompeting the H2O2, but IAM reacts too slowly to stop oxidation. The IAM reaction involves thiolate anions and is very slow with DTT, which is largely nonionized at pH 7.4. Therefore, it is remarkable that Prx2 is even less reactive. Detergent Changes the Reactivity of Prx2—The presence of SDS during removal of DTT by gel filtration made Prx2 more resistant to oxidation by H2O2, with minimal dimerization occurring at pH 7.4 in the absence of catalase (Fig. 9A). In contrast, SDS added to the reaction mixture made Prx2 more reactive with glycine chloramine (Fig. 9B) and with IAM, which gave only one mass peak corresponding to three alkylated residues (Fig. 7F). We have established that human Prx2 reacts much more rapidly with H2O2 than has been generally appreciated, with a rate constant comparable with that of catalase and glutathione peroxidases. This is particularly apparent in Fig. 3 where protein staining shows that more catalase protein than Prx2 was required to inhibit Prx2 dimerization. Furthermore, the presence of small amounts of catalase in Prx2 preparations did not change the stoichiometry of its reaction with H2O2. The catalase inhibition data enabled us to estimate that rate constants for the reaction of both proteins with H2O2 were comparable. This was quantified by measuring the inhibition of horseradish peroxidase oxidation to compound I, which gave a value of 1.3 × 107 m-1 s-1. The discovery of the peroxiredoxins, while adding a new player to the team of hydrogen peroxide-removing enzymes (1Netto L.E.S. Chae H.Z. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15315-15321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), has created some confusion in defining their role in antioxidant defense. The problem has been that the estimated rate constant for the reaction of Prx2 (and related family members) with H2O2 was so much less than that of catalase and glutathione peroxidase that it seemed the peroxiredoxins were “not efficient enough to compete with catalase or the seleno-peroxidases” (8Hofmann B. Hecht H.J. Flohe L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). The 100-fold higher value obtained here using two independent methods overcomes this dilemma. It means Prx2 reacts with H2O2 as fast as catalase, and because it is a relatively abundant cellular protein, should be a very effective H2O2 scavenger or sensor. This has been demonstrated directly for the erythrocyte (22Low F.M. Hampton M.B. Peskin A.V. Winterbourn C.C. Blood. 2007; 109: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The reactivity of Prx2 may have been underestimated previously because measurements were based on the rates of NADPH oxidation (6Chae H.Z. Kim H.J. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1999; 45: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and therefore reflected the regeneration by the thioredoxin reductase system rather than oxidation by H2O2. The rate constant we obtained for Prx2, although higher than anticipated, is comparable with the 1–2 × 107 m-1 s-1 measured for thioredoxin peroxidases I and II from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (17Ogusucu R. Rettori D. Munhoz D.C. Soares Netto L.E. Augusto O. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 42: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and the 4 × 107 m-1 s-1 for the bacterial peroxiredoxin AhpC (13Parsonage D. Youngblood D.S. Sarma G.N. Wood Z.A. Karplus P.A. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10583-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These values were also obtained by direct kinetic measurements rather than from NADPH oxidation. We found that t-butyl hydroperoxide and cumene hydroperoxide oxidized Prx2 rapidly. The rates of disappearance in Fig. 5 indicate that they react at least 1000 times faster than the amino acid chloramines, but it is not possible to determine whether they are as reactive as H2O2. The reaction with HOCl was also fast. However, the excess of HOCl required for complete Prx2 dimerization, together with the known high reactivity of HOCl, suggests that this was not a specific reaction with the active site thiol. Apart from monochloramine, all the chloramines tested reacted slowly with Prx2. This is in striking contrast to other thiol compounds, which have been shown to react 100–1000 times faster with chloramines than with H2O2 (15Peskin A.V. Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 19Winterbourn C.C. Metodiewa D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 23Peskin A.V. Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 40: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Furthermore, chloramines react with thiolate anions (15Peskin A.V. Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and are therefore expected to favor low pK thiols. The peroxidatic cysteine (CP) of Prx2 is reputed to have a low pKa (24Wood Z.A. Schroder E. Robin H.J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2136) Google Scholar), and the pH profile for oxidation by H2O2 in Fig. 2 suggests a value of 5–6. Yet our estimated rate constants for the amino acid chloramines reacting with Prx2 are substantially lower than for GSH, which has a pKa of 8.8. The reason for the anomalous behavior of Prx2 was explored by comparing different chloramines. The observed order of reactivity monochloramine > histamine > glycine > taurine chloramine is similar to that for low molecular weight thiols (21Peskin A.V. Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 1252-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the latter do not show the large difference between monochloramine and the other oxidants seen with Prx2. For example, the rate constant for the reaction of monochloramine with 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (1.4 × 104 m-1 s-1) 4A. V. Peskin and C. C. Winterbourn, unpublished data. is only 1.5 times higher than for histamine chloramine (21Peskin A.V. Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 1252-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). On the assumption that CP is ionized, these results suggest that its accessibility to the amino acid chloramines may be restricted. The much higher reactivity with monochloramine could reflect its smaller size, although the faster reaction of uncharged ethanolamine chloramine compared with glycine chloramine suggests that charge may also contribute. Prx2 also reacted slowly with alkylating agents. Treatment with 50 mm iodoacetamide for 8 min at pH 7.4 left most of the protein underivatized. Alkylation increased with increasing iodoacetamide concentration (or time; data not shown) but was never complete, and under most conditions only one of the three thiols became modified. The observed dimerization of Prx2 when excess iodoacetamide was added to solutions containing DTT can be explained by preferential alkylation of the DTT so that it was no longer available to reverse Prx2 oxidation by adventitious H2O2. This low reactivity compared with DTT pKSH 9.2 is not expected of a low pK thiol. Reaction with NEM was faster, with most of the protein alkylated at two sites and substantial signal representing all three thiols labeled. However, the reaction was slow enough for Prx2 to dimerize in solutions containing DTT when NEM was added at a slight excess over the DTT. Our results indicate that reduced Prx2 is exceptionally reactive with H2O2 and other peroxides but shows very low reactivity with other thiol oxidants and alkylating agents. A possible explanation is that the reactive site is configured to favor peroxides over other substrates. If so, changing the tertiary structure of the protein should alter its reactivity. In agreement with this proposition, adding SDS substantially increased the reactivity of Prx2 with both glycine chloramine and iodoacetamide while making it more resistant to oxidation by H2O2. Therefore, it would appear that the Prx2 tertiary structure provides a specific environment that makes CP highly reactive with H2O2 while at the same time shielding it from reaction with other oxidants and thiol reagents. The high reactivity of H2O2 with Prx2 (and other 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (6Chae H.Z. Kim H.J. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1999; 45: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar)) is, we believe, unprecedented for a thiol protein. Glutathione peroxidases with active site cysteines have 3 orders of magnitude less reactivity than their selenocysteine counterparts (25Maiorino M. Aumann K.D. Brigelius-Flohe R. Doria D. van den Heuvel J. McCarthy J. Roveri A. Ursini F. Flohe L. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), whereas Prx2 has a similar reactivity to the selenoenzymes. The features of the active site environment that confer this reactivity are not yet clear. The CP thiol group is understood to be ionized because of the presence of a proximal Arg residue (24Wood Z.A. Schroder E. Robin H.J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2136) Google Scholar). However, ionization alone is insufficient to confer such high reactivity. Reduced Prx2 exists as a noncovalent decamer (24Wood Z.A. Schroder E. Robin H.J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2136) Google Scholar) and forms a disulfide bond between CP and CR on opposing chains when oxidized. It is apparent from the crystal structure that the distance between the two sulfur atoms is too great for this bond to form without structural reorganization involving movement of both Cys residues from clefts in the protein (13Parsonage D. Youngblood D.S. Sarma G.N. Wood Z.A. Karplus P.A. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10583-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This constraint slows down the dimerization reaction of the sulfenic acid intermediate formed on CP and facilitates further oxidation by hydrogen peroxide to the sulfinic acid (overoxidized) form (13Parsonage D. Youngblood D.S. Sarma G.N. Wood Z.A. Karplus P.A. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10583-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). It has been argued that this ability of the mammalian peroxiredoxins to be inactivated by excess peroxide has been selected for as a floodgate mechanism for redox regulation. It is proposed that the peroxiredoxins consume basal levels of H2O2, but when production increases they are inactivated and the H2O2 becomes available to react with other proteins in redox signaling pathways (4Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Science. 2003; 300: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). However, another possibility is that the structural features that constrain dimer formation may be important in conferring low reactivity to most thiol reagents and a high sensitivity and selectivity for peroxides. Although chloramines were used in this study primarily as reagents to probe the reactivity of Prx2, they are physiologically important oxidants that are produced in inflammatory situations by the reaction of amino compounds with the myeloperoxidase product, hypochlorous acid (26Winterbourn C.C. Toxicology. 2002; 181: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 27Pattison D.I. Davies M.J. Curr. Med. Chem. 2006; 13: 3271-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Chloramines are able to damage biomolecules and influence cell signaling events such as activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and NFκB pathways, cytokine production, and apoptosis (28Midwinter R.G. Cheah F.C. Moskovitz J. Vissers M.C. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 29Midwinter R.G. Peskin A.V. Vissers M.C.M. Winterbourn C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32205-32211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). They are highly selective for sulfur amino acids, and these processes are understood to involve oxidation of Cys or Met residues. We speculated that Prx2 might show the same high reactivity with chloramines as seen with peroxides and therefore have potential as a catalytic antioxidant for removal of chloramines. However, our finding that amino acid chloramines react more slowly with Prx2 than with GSH and other thiol proteins that we have examined (23Peskin A.V. Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 40: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) makes it unlikely that Prx2 would detoxify these chloramines. To study the reaction of Prx2 with the various oxidants, it was necessary to maintain the protein in a reduced form. This proved problematic, as passage through a spin column to remove DTT resulted in oxidation. This was because of adventitious H2O2 and was largely overcome by adding catalase to the elution buffer. Although perhaps surprising that sufficient H2O2 was encountered to cause this oxidation, during gel filtration a protein passes through much more buffer than the sample volume so only a submicromolar concentration of H2O2 in the buffer would be required. Low H2O2 concentrations have been detected in phosphate buffers (30Svensson B.E. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and these may be augmented through autoxidation of DTT (31Munday R. J. Appl. Toxicol. 1985; 5: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The fraction of oxidized protein became less at higher Prx2 concentrations or low pH, but to generate reduced protein in good yield others may also find it necessary to pre-equilibrate spin columns with buffer containing sufficient catalase to remove endogenous H2O2. The low reactivity of the Prx2 active site thiols with alkylating agents also has practical implications. For example, proteomic investigation of thiol redox state involves labeling reduced thiol proteins, usually with an iodoacetamide or maleimide derivative (32Landar A. Oh J.Y. Giles N.M. Isom A. Kirk M. Barnes S. Darley-Usmar V.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 40: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 33Baty J.W. Hampton M.B. Winterbourn C.C. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 1261-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Derivatization with iodoacetamide, especially at neutral pH, is unlikely to be complete, and oxidation during the reaction with both reagents is possible. We have shown that Prx2 is sufficiently reactive to act directly as a scavenger for H2O2. Its efficiency as a catalyst of peroxide removal should therefore be dictated by the rate at which it is recycled by the thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase system. Paradoxically, faster recycling also favors inactivation because of overoxidation. This is apparent in Jurkat cells where the dimer does not accumulate and overoxidation occurs (22Low F.M. Hampton M.B. Peskin A.V. Winterbourn C.C. Blood. 2007; 109: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In other cells, such as erythrocytes, recycling is slow; overoxidation is not seen, and the dimer accumulates under oxidative stress (22Low F.M. Hampton M.B. Peskin A.V. Winterbourn C.C. Blood. 2007; 109: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, reversible oxidation of peroxiredoxins may not only be an antioxidant activity. The sensitivity and selectivity of Prx2 for low amounts of H2O2, plus the ability to regulate reduction through the thioredoxin cycle, make it well suited to transducing redox signals initiated by H2O2. The conformational change associated with oxidation could affect interactions with other proteins in signaling pathways, or as is the case with yeast peroxiredoxin Gpx3 (34Delaunay A. Pflieger D. Barrault M.B. Vinh J. Toledano M.B. Cell. 2002; 111: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), oxidizing equivalents could be transferred to other regulatory proteins. Potential mechanisms for signal transduction through reversible peroxiredoxin oxidation in mammalian cells warrant further investigation."

https://openalex.org/W1980843465,"Molecular interactions between wall polysaccharides, which include cellulose and a range of noncellulosic polysaccharides such as xyloglucans and (1,3;1,4)-β-d-glucans, are fundamental to cell wall properties. These interactions have been assumed to be noncovalent in nature in most cases. Here we show that a highly purified barley xyloglucan xyloglucosyl transferase HvXET5 (EC 2.4.1.207), a member of the GH16 group of glycoside hydrolases, catalyzes the in vitro formation of covalent linkages between xyloglucans and cellulosic substrates and between xyloglucans and (1,3;1,4)-β-d-glucans. The rate of covalent bond formation catalyzed by HvXET5 with hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) is comparable with that on tamarind xyloglucan, whereas that with (1,3; 1,4)-β-d-glucan is significant but slower. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric analyses showed that oligosaccharides released from the fluorescent HEC:xyloglucan conjugate by a specific (1,4)-β-dglucan endohydrolase consisted of xyloglucan substrate with one, two, or three glucosyl residues attached. Ancillary peaks contained hydroxyethyl substituents (m/z 45) and confirmed that the parent material consisted of HEC covalently linked with xyloglucan. Similarly, partial hydrolysis of the (1,3;1,4)-β-d-glucan:xyloglucan conjugate by a specific (1,3;1,4)-β-d-glucan endohydrolase revealed the presence of a series of fluorescent oligosaccharides that consisted of the fluorescent xyloglucan acceptor substrate linked covalently with 2-6 glucosyl residues. These findings raise the possibility that xyloglucan endo-transglucosylases could link different polysaccharides in vivo and hence influence cell wall strength, flexibility, and porosity.

These findings raise the possibility that xyloglucan endo-transglucosylases could link different polysaccharides in vivo and hence influence cell wall strength, flexibility, and porosity. The structural integrity of land plants is dependent, in large part, on the collective strength and flexibility of the walls that surround individual cells, whereas key elements of cellular function, such as water and nutrient exchange, depend upon the porosity of the walls. Plant cell walls are dynamic structures that are altered during cell division, growth, and differentiation to enable cells to adapt to changing functional requirements and to environmental and pathogen-induced stresses. In addition, walls are important for intercellular cohesion and cell-cell communication and must be selectively permeable to water, nutrients, and growth regulators. The primary cell walls of vascular plants consist of cellulosic microfibrils that are embedded in a chemically complex matrix consisting mostly of polysaccharides but also containing structural proteins, enzymes, and phenolic acids (1Bacic A. Harris P.J. Stone B.A. Priess J. The Biochemistry of Plants. Academic Press, New York1988: 297-371Crossref Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 2Cosgrove D.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 850-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (2281) Google Scholar). Xyloglucans and pectic polysaccharides are the major noncellulosic polysaccharides of primary walls from dicotyledonous plants, whereas in the Poales and related commelinoid monocots, including commercially important cereals and grasses, glucuronoarabinoxylans and (1,3;1,4)-β-d-glucans are the predominant noncellulosic wall polysaccharides, and levels of pectic polysaccharides, glucomannans, and xyloglucans are relatively low (3Farrokhi N. Burton R.A. Brownfield L. Hrmova M. Wilson S.M. Bacic A. Fincher G.B. Plant Biotech. J. 2006; 4: 145-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In addition, wall composition and the fine structures of component polysaccharides vary depending upon the growth phase, cell type, cell position, and local region within the wall (4Carpita N.C.

New Phytol. 2002; 154: 347-358Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In some cell types, lignin is deposited throughout the wall during secondary thickening (6Jin Z. Katsumata K.S. Lam T.B.T. Iiyama K. Biopolymers. 2006; 83: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 7Boerjan W. Ralph J. Baucher M. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 519-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (3392) Google Scholar), and in response to pathogen attack, the rapid formation of a cross-linked protein network, together with the deposition of lignin and callose, can strengthen walls and create new physical barriers to invading microorganisms (8Knogge W. Kempken F. The Mycota. 11. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2002: 289-310Google Scholar). Although the types and abundance of polysaccharides in plant cell walls have been defined in detail, little information is available on the molecular interactions between constituent polysaccharides in the wall. In most wall models it is assumed that different polysaccharides are held in place through extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding rather than through covalent interactions (1Bacic A. Harris P.J.

Extraction of HvXET5—Barley (Hordeum vulgare L., cv.

The activity of HvXET5 during enzyme purification was determined radiometrically at 30 °C in 100 mm succinate or ammonium acetate buffers, pH 6.0, containing 5 mm calcium chloride, 0.3% (w/v) TXG, and 3H-labeled xyloglucan-derived saccharide heptaitol (XXXGol, specific radioactivity 83 MBq·μmol-1) (14Fry S.C. Smith R.C. Renwick K.F. Martin D.J. Hodge S.K. Matthews K.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) with ∼30,000 dpm per reaction mixture. The radioactivity incorporated in reaction products was counted on 2 × 1-cm Whatman chromatography 3MM paper strips in plastic vials and using LSC6500 scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA) with ∼48% efficiency for tritium, using EcoLume scintillation fluid, and with 70% quenching. Enzyme activity of HvXET5 during purification is expressed in katals, where 1 katal represents 1 mol of product formed per s; specific activity is expressed in picokatals·mg-1 protein.TABLE 1Enzyme yields and purification factors of HvXET5 from 7-day-old seedlingsPurification stepYieldSpecific activityRecoverybRecoveries are expressed as percentage of a total enzyme activity in a crude homogenate.Purification factorcPurification factors are based on specific activities.ProteinActivityaTotal enzyme activity in selectively pooled fractions was assayed radiometrically.mgpicokatalpicokatal·mg−1%-foldCrude homogenate (1 m NaCl extract)6,5977,7771.21001.090% (NH4)2SO45,3758,5121.61101.3Sepharose Q, pH 6.81,2547,77161005Phenyl-Sepharose, pH 6.04506,909158913PBE-94, pH 5.0-8.3502,996603950Bio-Gel P-60, pH 7.00.13633,63053,025a Total enzyme activity in selectively pooled fractions was assayed radiometrically.b Recoveries are expressed as percentage of a total enzyme activity in a crude homogenate.c Purification factors are based on specific activities. Open table in a new tab Protein Determination, SDS-PAGE, and Amino Acid Sequencing—Protein concentration determinations during purification and characterization of HvXET5 and SDS-PAGE were performed as described previously (15Hrmova M. Burton R.A. Biely P. Fincher G.B. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). During HvXET5 purification, protein was detected with colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 in methanol for 30 h at ambient temperature (16Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhart W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 225-262Crossref Scopus (2354) Google Scholar). This staining technique detects ∼6-10 ng of protein per band or 0.7 ng per mm2 (16Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhart W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 225-262Crossref Scopus (2354) Google Scholar, 17Candiano G. Brushi M. Musante L. Santucci L. Ghiggeri G.M. Carnemolla B. Orecchia P. Zardi L. Righetto P.G. Electrophoresis. 2004; 25: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). Automated amino acid sequence analysis of HvXET5 was performed by Edman degradation as described previously (18Hrmova M. Harvey A.J. Wang J. Shirley N.J. Jones G.P. Høj P.B. Fincher G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5277-5286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A single primary sequence was detected, with no secondary sequence. Clear signals for each phenylthiohydantoin amino acid residue derivative were detected. Isoelectric Focusing—The crude protein extracts and purified preparations were separated on a flatbed IEF apparatus (GE Healthcare) in 1-mm polyacrylamide gels using a pH gradient of 3.5-9.5. Pre-focused gels were run at 600 V for 30 min, followed by 800 V for a further 20 min. Proteins were detected with a Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye after the gels were fixed in 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Apparent pI values were estimated by reference to marker proteins with pI values of 4.45-9.6. Enzyme activity in gels was detected by overlaying the separation gels with a 1.5-mm 1.3% (w/v) agarose detection gel containing 0.2% (w/v) TXG and 5-10 μm of SR-labeled xyloglucan-derived oligosaccharides XGO-SR (XXXG-SR, XXLG-SR, XLLG-SR molar ratios were 1:1.6:1.8) (19Fry S.C. Plant J. 1997; 11: 1141-1150Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20Farkas V. Ait Mohand F. Stratilova E. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2005; 43: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) in 0.1 m succinate buffer, pH 6, containing 5 mm calcium chloride. The separation gels contacted with detection gels were incubated for 1-5 h at 30 °C, depending on the activity of the preparation under investigation. The detection gels were immediately fixed and de-stained in 60% (v/v) ethanol containing 5% (v/v) formic acid. The detection gel with fluorescent zones was evaluated under a UV lamp at 366 nm. pH Optimum and Enzyme Stability—The effect of pH on the activity of HvXET5 was determined by incubating 1 nm HvXET5 at 30 °C for 60 min in 50 mm citric acid, 100 mm sodium dihydrophosphate (McIlvaine) buffers, pH 4.0-8.5, in the presence of 0.02% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. A comparison of succinate, ammonium acetate, or sodium phosphate buffers, each at 50-200 mm, indicated that HvXET5 activity was unaffected by the ionic strength of these buffers. The thermal stability of HvXET5 was determined after 15 min of incubation at 0-70 °C. The freeze/thaw stability of HvXET5 at 1 nm concentration was determined after three cycles of freezing (-80 °C) and thawing (4 °C), each at duration of 3 min. Activity was subsequently measured at 30 °C in 100 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6, containing 5 mm calcium chloride, without and with the addition of 10% (v/v) glycerol. Enzyme activity was determined radiometrically as specified above, and expressed as % activity relative to maximal activity. Assays were performed in triplicate and standard errors of 8-14% were observed. Effects of Divalent Cations—The effect of Ca2+ (as calcium chloride) and Mg2+ (as magnesium sulfate), both in 0-15 mm concentration ranges, and of EDTA in a 0-20 mm concentration range, were determined by incubating 1 nm HvXET5 in 100 mm succinate buffer, pH 6. Enzyme activities were determined radiometrically as specified above, in triplicate and with a standard error of 8-10%. Substrate Specificities—The incubation mixtures contained 1.2% (w/v) soluble polysaccharides as donor substrates and as acceptor substrates either 23-27 μm XGO-SR, SR-labeled cello-oligosaccharides (CEO-SR) (DP 2-8), or SR-labeled laminari-oligosaccharides (LAO-SR) (DP 2-6) (20Farkas V. Ait Mohand F. Stratilova E. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2005; 43: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) in 100 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6, containing 5 mm calcium chloride and 0.5-1 nm purified HvXET5. The molar ratios of individual oligosaccharides in the two oligosaccharide-SR mixtures were 1:0.78:0.62:0.41:0.16:0.03:0.013 for C2-SR to C8-SR (SR-labeled cellobiose to cellooctaose), and 1.0:1.7:0.87:0.41:0.2 for L2-SR to L6-SR (SR-labeled laminaribiose to laminarihexaose). All incubations proceeded for 18 h at 30 °C. Enzymes inactivated by boiling for 3 min served as controls. The efficiency of transfer of selected polysaccharides onto fluorescent acceptors was determined by size-exclusion HPLC. The SR-labeled oligosaccharides and polysaccharides were detected following HPLC by fluorescence detection (excitation 568 nm and emission 584 nm) or by evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD) at 568 nm, and by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analyses. Enzyme activities were determined by integrating peak areas, after subtracting background level obtained from boiled enzyme control reactions. Relative activities of HvXET5 are expressed as % of activity observed with TXG as a donor substrate and XGO-SR as an acceptor. In all instances assays were performed in duplicate with standard errors of 8-12%. Detection limits of the fluorescence assays and ELSD were better than 0.1 pmol of XGO-SR or CEO-SR, or 1 × 10-5% of the amount of XGO-SR or CEO-SR acceptors used in standard enzyme reactions, with a standard error of 6%. The efficiency of transfer of selected polysaccharides onto [3H]XXXGol was further evaluated by ascending chromatography in 60% (v/v) ethanol on Whatman chromatography 3MM paper strips, and radioactivity in paper strips was determined by liquid scintillation counting as specified above. Preparation of HEC:XXXG-SR and (1,3;1,4)-β-d-Glucan: XXXG-SR Conjugates—XXXG-SR was prepared as described (19Fry S.C. Plant J. 1997; 11: 1141-1150Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20Farkas V. Ait Mohand F. Stratilova E. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2005; 43: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and purified on a reversed phase column with a water/acetonitrile gradient. A relatively homogeneous HEC and (1,3; 1,4)-β-d-glucan fractions (collected after separations by sizeexclusion chromatography) at 0.8% (w/v) concentrations were dissolved in 100 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6, containing 5 mm calcium chloride and incubated with 8 μm XXXG-SR, in the presence of 4 nm purified HvXET5 at 30 °C with shaking. Every 16 h (HEC) or 24 h ((1,3;1,4)-β-d-glucan), a fresh HvXET5 enzyme (¼ of the original amount) was added. The reactions were terminated by boiling after 48 and 144 h, for HEC and (1,3;1,4)-β-d-glucan, respectively. The rates of synthesis of HEC:XGO-SR conjugate by HvXET5 at 1 nm concentration were followed for 0, 16, and 24 h. The rates of transfer of 130 μm XXXGol onto 0.1% (w/v) HEC:XGO-SR conjugate by HvXET5 (1 nm) were followed for 0, 6, and 16 h. Boiled enzymes served as controls in all instances. The products were analyzed by HPLC with fluorescent and ELSD detectors. Characterization of HEC:XXXG-SR and (1,3;1,4)-β-d-Glucan:XXXG-SR Conjugates—Approximately 0.5 mg of HEC: XXXG-SR or (1,3;1,4)-β-d-glucan:XXXG-SR was dissolved in 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5, and incubated with 10 nm of the purified 1,4-β-d-glucan endohydrolase from T. reesei (family GH5 glycoside hydrolase (21Suurnäkki A. Tenkanen M. Siika-aho M. Niku-Paavola M.-L. Viikari L. Buchert J. Cellulose. 2000; 7: 189-209Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar)) or 1 nm of the purified (on Bio-Gel P-60) (1,3;1,4)-β-d-glucanase (a family GH16 glycoside hydrolase (22Hahn M. Keitel T. Heinemann U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)) from B. subtilis for 1 h at 30°C. The reactions were stopped by boiling, and the hydrolysis products of HEC:XXXG-SR and (1,3;1,4)-β-d-glucan:XXXG-SR were separated by HPLC and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. HPLC Analysis—Native polysaccharides were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography on either a P3000 or P4000 PolySep GFC columns (particle size not specified, 300 × 7.8 mm) (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with water or 100 mm ammonium acetate as eluant at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Fractionations of the mixture of XGO-SR (XXXG-SR, XXLG-SR, and XLLG-SR) and the hydrolysis products of HEC:XXXG-SR and (1,3;1,4)-β-d-glucan:XXXG-SR were performed on a Hypersil ODS column (5 μm, 250 × 2.1 mm) (Thermo Electron Corp., Waltham, MA) with a linear gradient of 23.45-26.65% aqueous acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. A model 1090 liquid chromatograph with diode-array detector, controlled by ChemStation software (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA), and fluorescence (model RF-10AXL, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and ELSD (model 800, Alltech Associates Inc., Deerfield, IL) connected in series to the 1090 DAD, were used for analyses of enzymic reactions. The eluant flow from the fluorescence detector to the ELSD was split in the ratio 5 (to collect) to 1 (ELSD). The ELSD was operated at 40 °C and a nitrogen pressure of 1.5 bar, and the column temperature was 21 °C. Size-exclusion HPLC of SR-labeled polysaccharides and oligosaccharides were carried out on a BioSep SEC S3000 column (5 μm, 300 × 7.8 mm); the eluant was 100 mm ammonium acetate in 20% (v/v) acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Analyses—MALDI TOF spectra were acquired using a Bruker Ultraflex II MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) operating in a reflectron mode. Samples (1 μl) dissolved in water were mixed with 1 μl of a 5 g/liter solution of dihydroxybenzoic acid in 1% (v/v) phosphoric acid and spotted on a matt-steel target plate. External calibration was performed using peptide standards (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany), which were analyzed under the same conditions. Spectra were acquired using between 800-3,000 laser shots. The ionization voltages were IS1 = 25.0 kV, IS2 = 21.7 kV, and lens = 8.2 kV. The mass spectrometer was calibrated with XXXGSR, XXLG-SR, and XLLG-SR that were purified by tandem normal phase and size-exclusion HPLC. Purification of the Barley HvXET5—The barley HvXET5 enzyme was purified ∼3,000-fold from extracts of 7-day-old barley seedlings, using ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion exchange and hydrophobic chromatography, chromatofocusing, and sizeexclusion chromatography (Table 1). The numbering of the barley XET isoenzymes is based upon the gene nomenclature proposed by Strohmeier et al. (23Strohmeier M. Hrmova M. Fischer M. Harvey A.J. Fincher G.B. Pleiss J. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 3200-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the purified HvXET5 was 3,630 picokatals·mg-1, which is about six times higher than the specific activity of a recombinant Populus XET PttXET16A (24Kallas A.M. Piens K. Denman S. Henriksson H. Fäldt J. Johansson P. Brumer H. Teeri T.T. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and close to that of a cauliflower XET purified by affinity chromatography on xyloglucan (25Steele N. Fry S.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 207-211PubMed Google Scholar). It was necessary to use 1 m NaCl in the imidazole buffer for efficient enzyme extraction, presumably because the XET enzymes are tightly associated with cell wall material. The key steps during the purification of HvXET5 were chromatofocusing on PBE-94 and chromatography on Bio-Gel P-60, where several HvXET isoenzymes were separated from each other and from major contaminating proteins (Table 1). The enzymes bound strongly to phenyl-Sepharose and were not eluted by a 3-0 m linear gradient of NaCl. A 30-70% linear gradient of ethylene glycol was required for elution, suggesting that the enzymes were highly hydrophobic. The HvXET5 isoenzyme also bound to Bio-Gel P-60 and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, and 0.2 m NaCl were required to elute the enzyme from the column. The final purified enzyme preparation showed a single band of 34 kDa on SDS gels at high protein loadings (Fig. 1A), with no other protein species present. These data indicated that contaminating proteins accounted for less than 6 ng or 0.25% of the protein used for SDS-PAGE analysis. Furthermore, a single protein and activity band of pI 7.6 was detected on an isoelectric focusing gel and on a zymogram detection gel containing TXG- and SR-labeled xyloglucan oligosaccharides XGO-SR (Fig. 1B). A single sequence was detected during NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the purified HvXET5 enzyme, where a 97% yield of a phenylthiohydantoin-alanine in the 1st cycle, normalized per mol of the total protein of HvXET5, was obtained. Another isoenzyme, HvXET6, was partially purified from 7-day-old barley seedlings but contained small amounts of other proteins and was not examined further. pH Optimum and Enzyme Stability—The pH optimum of the purified HvXET5 was 6.0, and the temperature optimum varied between 28 and 30 °C (Fig. 2). The enzyme also operated efficiently at 0 °C, where it showed ∼40% of the activity observed at 30 °C. A similar tolerance to low temperature has also been observed with recombinant TCH4 XET enzyme from Arabidopsis (26Purugganan M.M. Braam J. Fry S.C. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As for the freeze/thaw stability of HvXET5, the purified enzyme retained its activity for at least a year when stored at -20 °C and did not lose activity after several freeze-thaw cycles. The addition of 10% (v/v) glycerol had no affect on HvXET activity after several freeze-thawing cycles. The Effects of Divalent Cations—Effects of the divalent cations Ca2+ and Mg2+ were tested on the activity of HvXET5 under optimal conditions. Although Ca2+ at concentrations between 5 and 15 mm stimulated HvXET5 activity by ∼7-8%, Mg2+ inhibited the activity of HvXET5 by 3-4% in the same concentration range. The chelating agent EDTA inhibited the activity of HvXET5 by ∼30% in 2-20 mm concentration ranges (data not shown). Substrate Specificity of the Purified HvXET5—Xyloglucan oligosaccharides (XGO-SR) and cello-oligosaccharides (CEOSR) fluorescently labeled with sulforhodamine (SR) were used as acceptor substrates for the purified HvXET5. Transferase activity was observed when tamarind xyloglucan (TXG), hydroxyethylcellulose ("

Hepcidin, the central iron regulatory hormone, is secreted from hepatocytes, whereas HFE2 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and liver. Previous studies demonstrated that HJV is a GPI-anchored protein, binds the proteins neogenin and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP2 and BMP4), and can be released from the cell membrane (shedding). In this study, we investigated the physiological significance and the underlying mechanism of HJV shedding. In acutely iron-deficient rats with markedly suppressed hepatic hepcidin expression, we detected an early phase increase of serum HJV with no significant change of either HFE2 mRNA or protein levels in gastrocnemius muscle. Studies in both C2C12 (a mouse myoblast cell line) and HepG2 (a human hepatoma cell line) cells showed active HJV shedding, implying that both skeletal muscle and liver could be the source of serum HJV. In agreement with the observations in iron-deficient rats, HJV shedding in these cell lines was down-regulated by holo-transferrin in a concentration-dependent manner. Our present study showing that knock-down of endogenous neogenin, a HJV receptor, in C2C12 cells suppresses HJV shedding and that overexpression of neogenin in HEK293 cells markedly enhances this process, suggests that membrane HJV shedding is mediated by neogenin. The finding that neither BMP4 nor its antagonist, noggin, was able to alter HJV shedding support the lack of involvement of BMP signaling pathway in this process.

Iron is an essential nutrient required for a variety of biochemical processes such as respiration, metabolism, and DNA synthesis. Cells and organisms possess tightly regulated but poorly understood mechanisms for iron absorption and metabolism. Iron homeostasis in the body is regulated primarily at the level of iron uptake through the intestine. Mutations in the key iron homeostatic proteins result in hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). 2The abbreviations used are: HH, hereditary hemochromatosis; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; CM, conditioned culture medium; FAC, ferric ammonium citrate; Fpn, ferroportin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; HAMP, gene for hepcidin; HFE2, gene for human, rat, and mouse HFE2; HJV, protein for human, rat, and mouse hemojuvelin; JH, juvenile hemochromatosis; ID, iron-deficient; neo, neogenin; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; RGM, repulsive guidance molecule; Tf, transferrin; TIBC, serum total iron binding capacity; TfR, transferrin receptor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum. HH is a heterogeneous group of inherited iron overload disorders linked to mutations in several genes including HFE, HFE2, HAMP, and TFR2 (1Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. Andrews N.C.

HJV is encoded by the gene simultaneously cloned in humans as HFE2 and in mice as RGMc, the third member of the repulsive guidance molecule family (2Papanikolaou G. Samuels M.E. Ludwig E.H.

De Gobbi M. Semin. Hematol. 2002; 39: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The central role of HFE2 in body iron homeostasis is supported by the most recent findings in mice with disruptions of both HFE2 alleles (Hjv–/–), showing a marked increase of iron deposition in liver, pancreas, and heart (17Huang F.W.

The severe suppression of hepatic hepcidin 3For simplicity, hepcidin is used for both the gene and its encoded protein in rat and human. expression observed in both HFE2 mutation-related JH patients and Hjv–/– mice implies that HJV is a key upstream regulator of hepcidin expression. Hepcidin, a central iron-regulatory peptide hormone, plays a pivotal role in maintaining body iron homeostasis through down-regulating the iron exporter ferroportin (Fpn) (19Nemeth E. Tuttle M.S. Powelson J. Vaughn M.B. Donovan A. Ward D.M. Ganz T. Kaplan J. Science. 2004; 306: 2090-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (3691) Google Scholar). Fpn is responsible for the uptake of iron into the body from the intestine (1Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. Andrews N.C. Cell. 2004; 117: 285-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). In this manner, increases in hepcidin levels result in decreased absorption of dietary iron. A recent study indicates that HJV induces hepatic hepcidin expression through BMP-mediated signaling pathway by being a co-receptor for BMP2 and BMP4 (10Babitt J.L. Huang F.W. Wrighting D.M. Xia Y. Sidis Y. Samad T.A. Campagna J.A. Chung R.T. Schneyer A.L. Woolf C.J. Andrews N.C. Lin H.Y. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). BMPs are cytokines of the TGF-β superfamily, which exhibit multiple roles in a wide variety of processes through different signaling pathways (20ten Dijke P. Hill C.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 265-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 21Feng X.H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). The underlying mechanism by which BMP signaling regulates hepatic hepcidin expression in response to body iron status still remains unknown. In addition to BMPs, our previous studies showed that HJV also interacts with neogenin (7Zhang A.S. West Jr., A.P. Wyman A.E. Bjorkman P.J. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33885-33894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Neogenin is a transmembrane protein widely expressed in different tissues including skeletal muscle and liver (22Vielmetter J. Kayyem J.F. Roman J.M. Dreyer W.J. J.

Biol. 2006; 296: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle cell lines, studies demonstrated the involvement of neogenin in myotube formation (27Kang J.S. Yi M.J. Zhang W. Feinleib J.L. Cole F. Krauss R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 493-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The interaction of HJV with neogenin increases iron loading into HEK293 cells (7Zhang A.S. West Jr., A.P. Wyman A.E. Bjorkman P.J. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33885-33894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The role of this interaction in the maintenance of body iron homeostasis still remains to be resolved. HFE2 mRNA is expressed highly in skeletal muscle and at relatively lower levels in liver (2Papanikolaou G. Samuels M.E. Ludwig E.H. MacDonald M.L. Franchini P.L. Dube M.P. Andres L. MacFarlane J. Sakellaropoulos N. Politou M. Nemeth E. Thompson J. Risler J.K. Zaborowska C. Babakaiff R. Radomski C.C. Pape T.D. Davidas O. Christakis J. Brissot P. Lockitch G. Ganz T. Hayden M.R. Goldberg Y.P. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes are the main source of both HJV and hepcidin in the liver (18Niederkofler V. Salie R. Arber S. J. Clin.

Blood. 2004; 103: 1509-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The finding that liver HFE2 mRNA levels do not respond to high body iron status in mice, imply that the induction of hepatic hepcidin does not occur through transcriptional control of HFE2 (30Krijt J. Vokurka M. Chang K.T. Necas E. Blood. 2004; 104: 4308-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although recent studies show that endogenous HJV expression is induced during the differentiation of C2 cells, a mouse myoblast cell line (11Kuninger D. Kuns-Hashimoto R. Kuzmickas R. Rotwein P. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3273-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Kuninger D. Kuzmickas R. Peng B. Pintar J.E. Rotwein P. Genomics. 2004; 84: 876-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the function and the regulation of HJV in skeletal muscle are not known. HJV does not appear to play a major role in muscle development because individuals with JH do not have any obvious muscle abnormalities (2Papanikolaou G. Samuels M.E. Ludwig E.H. MacDonald M.L. Franchini P.L. Dube M.P. Andres L. MacFarlane J. Sakellaropoulos N. Politou M. Nemeth E. Thompson J. Risler J.K. Zaborowska C. Babakaiff R. Radomski C.C. Pape T.D. Davidas O. Christakis J. Brissot P. Lockitch G. Ganz T. Hayden M.R. Goldberg Y.P. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). The extent to which dysregulation of muscle HFE2 affects systemic iron metabolism remains unexplored. A recent study reported the presence of HJV in human serum, demonstrated an iron suppressed-membrane HJV release (commonly called shedding) in HFE2-transfected-cells, and found that the soluble form of HJV competitively inhibits the induction of hepcidin expression through the action of membrane bound form of HJV (32Lin L. Goldberg Y.P. Ganz T. Blood. 2005; 106: 2884-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). However, the origin of serum HJV and its physiological significance are unclear. In this study we investigated the response of serum HJV as well as HFE2 expression in skeletal muscle to various extents of iron deficiency using rats as a model. The underlying mechanism of HJV shedding, in response to iron, was studied using a mouse myoblast cell line, C2C12 that can be induced to differentiate into myotubes, a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2), and HEK293 cells. Our results indicate that membrane HJV shedding is a transferrin-regulated and neogenin-mediated process. Generation of Iron-deficient Rats—Rats were made iron-deficient as previously described (33Chen O.S. Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) were randomly assigned to two different categories with free access to a control diet (50 mg iron/kg diet, group control) or were pair-fed an iron-deficient (ID) diet (less than 2 mg iron/kg diet, group ID). Pair-feeding involves providing the control group with the same amount of diet consumed by the animals fed the iron-deficient diet on the previous day with the two groups on a staggered schedule differing by 1 day. Pair-feeding is a necessary control because animals fed the iron-deficient diet exhibit reduced food intake. Pair-feeding ensures the two groups of animals have equivalent energy intake but different iron intake. All animals had free access to water. Animals fed the diets for 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, or 21 days were anesthetized with isoflurane, and blood was collected by heart puncture for serum preparation. The animals were euthanized while under anesthesia by incising the diaphragm. Skeletal muscles (gastrocnemius and soleus) and liver were rapidly removed and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at –80 °C for qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. There are either 4 or 5 animals per each group as indicated in the text. All procedures for animal use met the requirements of the University of Wisconsin Research Animal Resource Center. Serum Iron Analysis and Liver Non-heme Iron Assay—Serum iron, serum total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and transferrin saturation were analyzed by Cornell University Veterinary Diagnostic Service. Quantitative measurement of non-heme iron in liver tissues was performed as described previously (17Huang F.W. Pinkus J.L. Pinkus G.S. Fleming M.D. Andrews N.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2187-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as microgram iron per gram wet tissue. Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)—Total RNA from rat skeletal muscle and liver was isolated using TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Contaminating genomic DNA was removed by DNase treatment, followed by another cycle of RNA purification using RNeasy kit (Qiagen). cDNA preparation and qRT-PCR analysis were conducted essentially the same as previously described (29Zhang A.S. Xiong S. Tsukamoto H. Enns C.A. Blood. 2004; 103: 1509-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The primers for rat HFE2 are 5′-TTCCAATCCTGCGTCTTTGAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGAAAAGGTGCAAGTTCTCCAA-3′ (reverse). The primers for rat neogenin are 5′-GGCACAGCACCTGCCTTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGCCTCTTCTCTGACACAAAATCT-3′ (reverse). All other primers used are the same as previously described (29Zhang A.S. Xiong S. Tsukamoto H. Enns C.A. Blood. 2004; 103: 1509-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The result for each gene of interest is expressed as the amount relative to that of GAPDH in each specific sample. Membrane HJV Shedding Analysis in Transfected Cells—Mouse myoblast cell line, C2C12, was obtained from Dr. Matt Thayer, OHSU, Portland, OR. Human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, and human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK293, were purchased from ATCC. There was no detectable endogenous HFE2 mRNA or HJV protein in HepG2, HEK293 and un-induced C2C12 cells by qRT-PCR or Western blot analysis, respectively (data not shown). C2C12 cells were cultured in DMEM/15% FCS, and transiently transfected in 60-mm plates with either human HFE2 cDNA or the empty vector pcDNA3 using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). To avoid the possible differences in transfection efficiency of different plates, we pooled the transfected cells after about 24 h of transfection, followed by subculturing the cells into 12-well plates in 1 ml of DMEM/10% FCS. After another 24 h or 48 h of incubation in the presence of 30 μm transferrin (Tf) with different ratios of holo- to apo-Tf, ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), 50 ng/ml BMP4 (R&D system), or 1 μg/ml noggin (R&D system) as indicated in the text, the conditioned culture medium (CM) was collected and cell lysate prepared using NET-Triton buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Protease Inhibitors Mixture, Roche Applied Science) as described previously (7Zhang A.S. West Jr., A.P. Wyman A.E. Bjorkman P.J. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33885-33894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. HJV and other indicated proteins in cell lysate and 120 μl of CM were detected by Western blot with corresponding antibodies as described below under “Immunodetection.” The amounts of detected HJV in the CM reflect HJV release from the cells. For brevity, we will define this process as HJV shedding in the following text. HepG2 cells were cultured in MEM/10% FCS/1 mm pyruvate/1× non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen). Cells were stably transfected with either HFE2 cDNA (HJV-HepG2) or the empty vector pcDNA3 (HepG2) using Nucleofector kit V (Amaxa Biosystems) and maintained in complete medium with 800 μg/ml G418. The effect of FAC, Tf, BMP4, or noggin on membrane HJV shedding was examined by changing to fresh complete medium with the indicated concentration of reagents after 24 h of subculture. CM was collected and cell lysate was prepared after another 24 h or 48 h of incubation. HJV and other indicated proteins were then immunodetected as described above for C2C12 cells. HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM/10% FCS/1 mm pyruvate. To study the HJV shedding, we generated the following HEK293 cells with various combinations of HJV and neogenin expression: 1) cells stably transfected with the empty vector pcDNA3 (C); 2) cells transiently transfected with HJV alone (HJV); 3) cells stably transfected with both HJV and neogenin (HJV/neo); 4) cells with a stably transfected neogenin and a transiently transfected HJV; 5) cells stably transfected with G320V HJV alone; (6Wilson N.H. Key B. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. November, 2, 2006; 10.1016/j.biocel.2006.10.023PubMed Google Scholar) cells with a stable transfection of neogenin and a transient transfection of G320V HJV. Cells were incubated in the presence of either 30 μm holo-Tf or 50 μg/ml FAC with complete medium. Membrane HJV shedding into the CM were detected essentially the same as described above for C2C12 cells. Endogenous HJV Shedding Analysis in Differentiated C2C12 Cells—C2C12 cells, a subclone of C2 cells, can rapidly differentiate, form contractile myotubes and produce characteristic muscle proteins (34Blau H.M. Pavlath G.K. Hardeman E.C. Chiu C.P. Silberstein L. Webster S.G. Miller S.C. Webster C. Science. 1985; 230: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). We induced the differentiation of C2C12 cells as previously described for C2 cells (11Kuninger D. Kuns-Hashimoto R. Kuzmickas R. Rotwein P. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3273-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, C2C12 cells were plated on gelatin (Chemicon, International, Temecula, CA) coated plates at the density of 3 × 103 cells/cm2 in DMEM/15% FCS. After 48 h, differentiation was initiated by switching the culture medium to DMEM/2% horse serum (Invitrogen). Holo-Tf (30 μm) or FAC (10 μg/ml) was added into the induction medium after another 24 h of incubation. At 72 h after the initiation of induction, images of the differentiated cells were taken under light microscope. CM was collected and cell lysate prepared. The endogenous HJV in both CM and lysate was detected by Western blot analysis as described above for the transfected C2C12 cells. Knockdown of Endogenous Neogenin in C2C12 Cells Using siRNA—We used the SMARTpool siRNA reagent specific for mouse neogenin (Dharmacon) to knockdown the endogenous neogenin in C2C12 cells. RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen) was used for transfection. The negative control siRNA was the same as previously described (32Lin L. Goldberg Y.P. Ganz T. Blood. 2005; 106: 2884-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To maximize the efficacy of knock-down, siRNA was transfected into C2C12 cells twice, on day 1 and day 3. To examine the effects of endogenous neogenin on HJV shedding, HFE2 cDNA was introduced into C2C12 cells by Lipofectamine 2000 on day 2 at about 24 h after the first introduction of siRNA. Cells were subcultured into 6-well plates in 2 ml of medium on day 3 at the time to conduct the second siRNA transfection. HJV in CM and cell lysate was measured after another 24 h of culture (day 4) as described above for HFE2-transfected C2C12 cells. Neogenin in cell lysate was also measured. Immunodetection—Cell lysate (50 μg protein), CM (120 μl), or tissue extracts from rat gastrocnemius muscle or liver (100 μg protein) were subjected to 11% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, followed by transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were probed with affinity-purified rabbit anti-HJV antibody (0.22 μg/ml), rabbit anti-neogenin antibody (0.4 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-TfR1 (1:10,000, Zymed Laboratories Inc.), rabbit anti-ferritin (1:5,000, Roche Applied Science), rabbit anti-phospho-Smad1/5/8 (Cell Signaling Technology), or mouse anti-β-actin antibody (1:10,000, Chemicon International), followed by immunodetection using the corresponding secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (Super Signal, Pierce). The relative amounts of HJV in CM were also quantified by fluorescence imaging (Odyssey Infrared Imaging System; Li-Cor, Lincoln, NB) as described previously (35Johnson M.B. Enns C.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 4287-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). For all the detections, cell lysate prepared from HEK293-HJV/neo cells was included as a positive control for both HJV and neogenin. Mouse anti-β-actin antibody was used to detect the equal lysate protein loading. Our rabbit anti-HJV antibody cross-reacts with rat and mouse HJV (data not shown). For immunodetection of HJV in rat serum, 5 μl of serum sample were diluted with Laemmli loading buffer (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and subjected to 11% SDS-PAGE as described above. HJV was either detected by chemiluminescence as described for cell lysate or visualized and quantified by fluorescence imaging. Rat IgG was probed with rabbit anti-rat IgG and served as a loading control. The samples from each ID group, and the corresponding control group were analyzed on the same blot. Statistical Analysis—Standard deviation (S.D.) and a two-tailed Student's t test were used to evaluate the statistical significance of gene expression and serum HJV concentrations between ID rats and the corresponding control rats. Iron-deficient Diet Results in a Rapid Depletion of Serum Iron—We wanted to determine if the iron status of animals resulted in altered levels of HJV in the blood and to test whether serum HJV had physiological significance. Taking advantage of the high dietary iron requirement of weanling rats, we generated animals with various extents of iron deficiency by feeding an ID diet (containing less than 2 mg of the iron/kg diet), as previously described (33Chen O.S. Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), for 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days. The results from the analysis of serum iron, TIBC and serum Tf saturation are summarized in Table 1. In comparison to rats fed a regular iron diet (control), animals fed the ID diet exhibited a rapid decline of serum iron concentrations, showing a progressive and stable decrease in serum iron for up to 21 days. In agreement with the low iron status, TIBC in all ID groups were gradually increased. The levels of total liver non-heme iron, an indicator of liver iron storage, did not change as rapidly as serum iron levels. There was no statistical difference in the total liver non-heme iron level in the ID group compared with the control group at day 3 (ID: 62.3 ± 9.3 versus controls: 74.9 ± 9.8 μg iron/g tissue, p = 0.1117). However, a robust increase of TfR1 protein levels was observed in the liver tissues from the animals of ID group at this time point (supplemental Fig. S1), implying a decreased labile iron pool. By day 14, however, a dramatic difference of liver non-heme iron levels was detected (ID: 53.0 ± 7.8 versus controls: 100.8 ± 25.1 μg of the iron/g tissue, p = 0.0108). Because of the relatively low liver iron storage in these young rats, the difference in non-heme iron levels between days 3 and 14 is mainly derived from the lack of accumulation of storage iron in the ID group. The initial decrease in hepatic hepcidin mRNA levels correlated with the decrease in serum iron levels. Quantitative analysis of hepatic hepcidin mRNA by qRT-PCR showed ∼60- and 270-fold decrease in ID days 3 and 14 groups, respectively, compared with their corresponding control groups (results not shown). These results indicate that the reduced serum iron and/or hepatic labile iron pool could markedly down-regulate hepatic hepcidin expression (ID day 3). Because HJV is thought to be an upstream regulator of hepcidin expression, we sought to"
https://openalex.org/W1973902556,"Phosphodiesterase type 2A (PDE2A) hydrolyzes cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP, thus efficiently controlling cNMP-dependent signaling pathways. PDE2A is composed of an amino-terminal region, two regulatory GAF domains, and a catalytic domain. Cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis is known to be activated by cGMP binding to GAF-B; however, other mechanisms may operate to fine-tune local cyclic nucleotide levels. In a yeast two-hybrid screening we identified XAP2, a crucial component of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) complex, as a major PDE2A-interacting protein. We mapped the XAP2 binding site to the GAF-B domain of PDE2A. PDE assays with purified proteins showed that XAP2 binding does not change the enzymatic activity of PDE2A. To analyze whether PDE2A could affect the function of XAP2, we studied nuclear translocation of AhR, i.e. the master transcription factor controlling the expression of multiple detoxification genes. Notably, regulation of AhR target gene expression is initiated by tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD) binding to AhR and by a poorly understood cAMP-dependent pathway followed by the translocation of AhR from the cytosol into the nucleus. Binding of PDE2A to XAP2 inhibited TCDD- and cAMP-induced nuclear translocation of AhR in Hepa1c1c7 hepatocytes. Furthermore, PDE2A attenuated TCDD-induced transcription in reporter gene assays. We conclude that XAP2 targets PDE2A to the AhR complex, thereby restricting AhR mobility, possibly by a local reduction of cAMP levels.

In conjunction with adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases PDEs regulate the amplitude and duration of cell signaling events mediated by cyclic nucleotides. In this context PDEs are involved in a broad range of biological responses such as cardiac contractility, platelet aggregation, lipolysis, glycogenolysis, smooth muscle contraction, ion channel conductance, and apoptosis (1Iffland A. Kohls D. Low S. Luan J. Zhang Y. Kothe M. Cao Q. Kamath A.V. Ding Y.H. Ellenberger T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8312-8325Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Sequence analyses suggest that 11 different families of mammalian PDEs exist, and most of these families contain more than one gene product. Furthermore, many of these genes can be alternatively spliced in a tissue-specific manner to give rise to several different isoenzymes with altered regulatory properties, subcellular localization, and different substrate specificities. The distinct cellular localization and biophysical characteristics of the various PDEs suggest that each PDE is individually regulated and plays distinct roles in specific physiological processes (2Soderling S.H. Beavo J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar).PDE2A is activated by cGMP and degrades both, cAMP and cGMP. PDE2A is highly expressed in the brain and heart, but it is also found in lung, kidney, liver, and adrenal gland (3Rosman G.J. Martins T.J. Sonnenburg W.K. Beavo J.A. Ferguson K. Loughney K. Gene. 1997; 191: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). One of the first specific functions attributed to PDE2A is the regulation of aldosterone production in adrenal zona glomerulosa cells (4MacFarland R.T. Zelus B.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, PDE2A was found to attenuate spatially confined pools of cAMP in cardiac myocytes, thereby affecting contractile function (5Mongillo M. Tocchetti C.G. Terrin A. Lissandron V. Cheung Y.F.

Moreover, PDE2A appears to increase permeability of endothelial layers and thus to impair endothelial barrier function (6Seybold J. Thomas D. Witzenrath M. Boral S. Hocke A.C. Burger A. Hatzelmann A.

PDE2A is composed of an amino-terminal domain of unknown function, two central GAF domains (A and B), and a carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain (7Martinez S.E. Wu A.Y. Glavas N.A. Tang X.B. Turley S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 37928-37938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of the PDE2A GAF domains revealed that only the GAF-B domain is involved in cGMP binding, whereas the amino-terminal GAF-A domain is required for dimerization (7Martinez S.E. Wu A.Y. Glavas N.A. Tang X.B. Turley S. Hol W.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13260-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar).Here we report that PDE2A associates with XAP2, a member of the immunophilin protein family. XAP2 (also known as ARA9 or AIP) is a 38-kDa protein that is initially identified as a protein binding to the hepatitis B virus X protein (9Kuzhandaivelu N. Cong Y.S. Inouye C. Yang W.M. Seto E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4741-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and in parallel also as a binding partner of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) (10Carver L.A. LaPres J.J. Jain S.

Biol. 1998; 18: 978-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). XAP2 shares sequence identity with FKBP52, an immunophilin of the FK506 binding proteins and an established component of the glucocorticoid receptor complex. Although XAP2 contains an immunophilin homology domain within its amino-terminal region, no binding to immunosuppressant drugs is found (10Carver L.A. LaPres J.J. Jain S. Dunham E.E. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33580-33587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of XAP2 contains multiple tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs that mediate protein-protein interactions (13Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), and XAP2 has been shown to engage in a multiprotein complex together with a dimer of Hsp90, p23, and AhR (14Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Mimura J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 15Marlowe J.L. Puga A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 96: 1174-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). AhR is a ligand-activated transcription factor and belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix Per/ARNT/Sim family of proteins (16Bock K.W. Kohle C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 17Harper P.A. Riddick D.S. Okey A.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 267-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The activity of the AhR is regulated by structurally diverse xenobiotics such as the high affinity ligand 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) (18Denison M.S. Nagy S.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 309-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, the AhR translocates to the nucleus and dimerizes with the structurally related protein ARNT. The resultant complex interacts with enhancer elements upstream of target promoters and drives the transcription of a host of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (19Ramadoss P. Marcus C. Perdew G.H. Expert Opin. Drug Metab. Toxicol. 2005; 1: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Recently, cAMP has been described as a mediator of AhR translocation, acting as a repressor rather than an activator of AhR-dependent gene expression (20Oesch-Bartlomowicz B. Huelster A. Wiss O. Antoniou-Lipfert P. Dietrich C. Arand M. Weiss C. Bockamp E. Oesch F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9218-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar); however, the underlying molecular pathways have remained elusive. Here we identify a functional interaction between PDE2A and AhR pathways that is mediated by XAP2, an essential component of the AhR complex, providing a direct link between cAMP- and TCDD-dependent pathways.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The full-length PDE2A cDNA (clone IRAKp-961N0275Q2, GenBank™ accession number BC040974) was obtained from RZPD (Berlin, Germany). 8-Br-cAMP and db-cAMP were from Biolog (Bremen, Germany), and TCDD and forskolin were from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse were from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany).Two-hybrid Screening—The complete PDE2A cDNA was cloned into the SfiI and SalI sites of the pGBKT7 vector (Clontech, Takara Bio Europe, St-Germain-en-Laye, France). This construct encodes a fusion between the amino-terminal end of PDE2A and the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (bait). The screen was performed with a human brain two-hybrid cDNA library (Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System 3, Clontech) cloned into the XhoI and EcoRI sites of the pACT2 vector and expressing proteins as fusions with the Gal4 protein activation domain. This library was transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109 expressing the PDE2A bait construct. Positive clones were initially selected for growth in the absence of adenine, histidine, leucine, and tryptophane. Library plasmid DNA was isolated from the positive clones and re-transformed into yeast strain AH109 containing the bait, and the re-transformed positive clones were further assayed for the PDE2A interaction.Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-1 and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PAA, Pasching, Austria) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (PAA). Transient transfections of COS-1 cells were performed with DEAE-dextran. Briefly, 6 × 105 cells were seeded per 10-cm dish. On the following day, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and expression plasmids were applied in 5.7 ml of serum-free in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium mixed with 300 μl of DEAE-dextran (1 mg/ml stock) and 12 μl of chloroquine (100 mm stock). After incubation for 2 h, the transfection mixture was removed, and cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal calf serum for 48 h prior to harvesting. HeLa cells were transiently transfected using Metafectene (Biontex, Martin-sried, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The mouse hepatoma cell line (Hepa1c1c7), a kind gift from Barbara Oesch-Bartlomowicz (University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany), was propagated in α-minimum Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and transfections were performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All cells were maintained as monolayers in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air under saturating humidity at 37 °C.Generation of Mammalian Cell Expression Constructs—The PDE2A cDNA was cloned into the EcoRV and HindIII sites of the pSG8 vector (21Schultess J. Danielewski O. Smolenski A.P. Blood. 2005; 105: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) to generate a fusion construct with an amino-terminal vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein epitope sequence. A similar expression plasmid was generated to encode only the GAF-B domain of PDE2A. The circular site-directed mutagenesis method was used to introduce stop codons into the full-length PDE2A cDNA in pSG8 to obtain constructs expressing the amino terminus (N-PDE2A), whole GAF-A, and GAF-A/B domains amino-terminally fused to a VSV tag. The complete XAP2 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number U31913) was cloned into the HindIII and XhoI sites of pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen) with a FLAG epitope tag immediately downstream of the last codon of the XAP2 cDNA and into pcDNA3.1-Myc containing a Myc epitope at the amino terminus. The FLAG-AhR (human) construct was a kind gift of Gary H. Perdew (Pennsylvania State University), and the p1646p1Luc3 reporter plasmid was provided by Alvaro Puga (University of Cincinnati).Pulldown Experiments—The XAP2 cDNA was cloned into the SmaI and NotI site of the pGEX4T-3 vector (GE Healthcare) to generate a fusion between glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the amino terminus of XAP2. Additionally, XAP2 truncated constructs encoding GST fusions to the amino-terminal (amino acids 1-169; to create GST-N-XAP2) or carboxyl-terminal (amino acids 170-330; to create GST-C-XAP2) regions of XAP2 were generated. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) were transformed with these constructs, and protein expression was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The recombinant proteins were purified with glutathione 4B-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). COS-1 cells transfected with expression constructs for VSV-PDE2A were lysed by scraping in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, including the following protease inhibitors: 1.12 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm chloroquine, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 13,000 × g and 4 °C, and the cleared supernatants were collected. GST pulldown experiments were carried out by incubating 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads saturated with GST-XAP2, GST-N-XAP2, or GST-C-XAP2 with 500 μl of cleared COS-1 cell lysates for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed five times with lysis buffer before adding 10 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAA gels and identified by immunoblotting with anti-VSV antibody (clone P5D4 obtained from Sigma). For activity assays the GST fusion proteins were eluted from the beads with 800 μl of 10 mm reduced L-glutathione (Sigma).Immunoprecipitation—Cells were harvested and lysed by scraping in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer. Lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 13,000 × g and 4 °C, and supernatants were used to precipitate XAP2-FLAG using 5 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, and coprecipitated VSV-PDE2A was detected by immunoblotting with anti-VSV antibody. For immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins male CD rats were anaesthetized by ether and decapitated. Brain tissue was immediately isolated and homogenized in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% IGEPAL, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors complete Mini (Roche Diagnostics)). Insoluble material was removed, and supernatants were incubated with either rabbit IgG as control, XAP2 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), or PDE2A antibody (FabGennix Inc., Frisco, TX) for 1 h at 4 °C. Then protein G (for XAP2 sample) or protein A (for control and PDE2A sample)-Sepharose 4B fast flow beads (GE Healthcare) were added for 1 h. immunocomplexes were washed three times with IP buffer and twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and precipitated proteins were detected by immunoblotting.PDE2A Activity Assay—COS-1 cells (5 × 10 cm dishes) transfected with pSG8-PDE2A or with empty pSG8 vector (mock) were harvested in 1 ml of lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with 10 μl of mouse anti-VSV antibody for 2 h followed by incubation with 200 μl of protein A/G-PLUS agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) for 1 h. Beads were washed four times with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). Catalytic activity of PDE2A was assayed using the PDElight™ kit (Cambrex Bio Science, Verviers, Belgium) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, PDE2A-induced hydrolysis of cAMP generated AMP, which was phosphorylated to ATP. ATP is the energy source for the luciferin/luciferase oxidation reaction resulting in light emission. The emitted light is directly proportional to the level of AMP present in the reaction, which is a function of PDE activity. 5 μl of PDE2A beads (∼2.5 nm final concentration) were incubated with 125 nm of each GST fusion protein: GST-XAP2, GST-N-XAP2, GST-C-XAP2 or GST in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2 buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by addition of 25 μm cAMP and incubation for 1 h at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped, and luminescence was measured using a 96-well microplate reader Wallac Victor3 1420 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer).AhR Translocation and Co-localization Experiments—0.15 × 105 Hepa1c1c7 cells were seeded per chamber (1.8 cm2) of a 4-chamber slide, allowed to grow for 48 h, and transfected without or with the expression vector for VSV-tagged PDE2A. 24-h posttransfection, cells were incubated with 2 mm 8-Br-cAMP, 20 μm forskolin, or 5 nm TCDD for 1 h at 37 °C, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Then cells were incubated with anti-AhR M20 (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-VSV P5D4 (Sigma) for 2 h followed by incubation with Cy3-conjugated anti-goat IgG and Cy2-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Newmarket, England) for 1 h. For co-localization experiments, HeLa and Hepa1c1c7 cells were transfected with pSG8-VSV-PDE2A and pcDNA3.1-Myc-XAP2. After 1 day, cells were fixed and permeabilized as described above and stained with anti-VSV and anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) primary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C followed by staining with Cy-conjugated antibodies as described. Chamber slides were mounted in GEL/mount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA), and cells were analyzed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63/1.4 oil differential interference contrast objective lens and LSM 510 META software (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). For quantitative evaluation of PDE2A, effects on AhR translocation of 70-200 cells from at least three independent experiments were analyzed. Cells exhibiting cytosolic as well as nuclear staining of AhR were assigned to the “spread” group, whereas cells having a stronger or exclusive nuclear AhR staining were assigned “nuclear”.Reporter Assay—0.3 × 104 Hepa1c1c7 cells were seeded per well of a 96-well plate. After 48 h cells were transfected with 10 ng of pRL-SV40 (Promega GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), 225 ng of either pGL3-Basic (Promega) or p1646p1Luc3, and 75 ng of either pSG8 or PDE-pSG8. 24-h posttransfection, cells were stimulated with 5 nm TCDD for 4 h. The luminescence was measured using the Dual-Luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The relative light units were normalized to the expression of the Renilla luciferase. Data were collected from four independent experiments performed in quadruplicate. To verify expression of PDE, lysed cells were collected after each experiment, proteins were precipitated using acetone, solubilized in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.RESULTSYeast Two-hybrid Screening for PDE2A Interaction Partners and Identification of XAP2—To identify proteins that interact with PDE2A we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening. We used human PDE2A as bait and an adult human brain cDNA library as prey. A total of 236 clones were isolated and rescreened by retransformation and X-Gal staining. The remaining 141 positive clones were sequenced, cDNA artifacts and extracellular proteins were excluded, and six out of 25 putative PDE2A binding partners were selected for further analysis. We expressed the candidate proteins in E. coli as GST fusion proteins coupled to the carboxyl terminus of GST. Pulldown assays were performed using lysates from mammalian COS-1 cells transfected with PDE2A expression vectors. Two of these GST fusion proteins bound to PDE2A, and one of these was XAP2, a 330 amino acid protein of the immunophilin family (Fig. 1, A and B). For control, unfused GST was used revealing that GST alone did not pull-down PDE2A (Fig. 1, A and B).PDE2A Interacts with XAP2 in Intact Mammalian Cells—To confirm that PDE2A and XAP2 bind to each other in intact cells, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. For this purpose, the VSV epitope was fused to the amino terminus of PDE2A, and XAP2 was amino-terminally tagged with a FLAG epitope. Both proteins were expressed in COS-1 cells, either alone or in combination, and XAP2 was precipitated using anti-FLAG. Analysis of the precipitates by immunoblotting with anti-VSV revealed the presence of PDE2A only in precipitates from cells expressing both PDE2A and XAP2 (Fig. 1C). We confirmed the binding in a reverse experiment using anti-VSV to precipitate PDE2A followed by blotting for XAP2 with anti-FLAG (data not shown). To verify the interaction of PDE2A and XAP2 at the level of endogenous proteins we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments in lysates prepared from brain tissue. Analysis of the total lysate by immunoblotting confirmed the expression of both, PDE and XAP2 (Fig. 1D, first lane). Using a specific antibody against XAP2 we could precipitate endogenous XAP2. Immunoblotting of the XAP2 precipitates with a PDE2A antibody revealed the presence of endogenous PDE2A (Fig. 1D, third lane). In a reverse experiment using anti-PDE2A for immunoprecipitation we could detect XAP2 in the precipitates by immunoblotting. No unspecific binding of the proteins occurred in a control experiment using nonspecific IgG (Fig. 1D, second lane). These results clearly confirm the interaction of PDE2A with XAP2.PDE2A and XAP2 Colocalize in Cells—Next we investigated the subcellular localizations of PDE2A and XAP2 by immunofluorescence. Because our antibodies to FLAG generated a strong unspecific background in immunofluorescence stainings we created a Myc-tagged construct of XAP2. HeLa cells were cotransfected with VSV-tagged PDE2A and Myc-tagged XAP2 followed by fixation and immunostaining with tag-specific primary antibodies and labeled secondary antibodies. Both proteins localized to the cytosol in a reticular pattern (Fig. 2). Occasionally, staining of regions close to the plasma membrane could be observed. The subcellular distributions of PDE2A and XAP2 were similar, and the overlay revealed an extensive colocalization of the two proteins (Fig. 2C). A similar result was obtained after transfection and staining of PDE2A and XAP2 in mouse Hepa1c1c7 cells (data not shown). To exclude cross-reactivity of secondary antibodies we stained transfected cells with a single primary antibody at a time followed by both secondary antibodies. Only the appropriate secondary antibody bound to its target primary antibody confirming specificity of the probes (data not shown). Together these experiments show that PDE2A and XAP2 may interact in vitro and in intact cells.FIGURE 2Co-localization of PDE2A and XAP2 in HeLa cells. HeLa cells were co-transfected with Myc-tagged XAP2 and VSV-tagged PDE2A. Cells were fixed 24 h after transfection, permeabilized, and double-labeled with rabbit anti-Myc and mouse anti-VSV followed by incubation with carbocyanine-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cy3-anti-rabbit and Cy2-anti-mouse). Cells were visualized by confocal microscopy. Panels A and B show staining of Myc-tagged XAP2 and VSV-tagged PDE2A alone, and panel C is the overlay of both pictures. Bar, 10 μm. The figure is representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The GAF-B Domain of PDE2A Mediates Binding to XAP2—To determine the domain of PDE2A involved in binding to XAP2 we generated various constructs of PDE2A containing either the amino terminus of PDE2A, the amino terminus and the GAF-A domain (GAF-A), the amino terminus, and both GAF domains (GAF-A/B) or the GAF-B domain alone (GAF-B) (Fig. 3A). All PDE2A constructs were amino-terminally fused to VSV. The constructs were transfected into COS-1 cells, and full-length GST-XAP2 as well as GST alone as control was used to precipitate the various PDE2A constructs from cell lysates. Full-length PDE2A, GAF-A/B, and the GAF-B domain alone readily bound to XAP2, whereas N-PDE2A and GAF-A alone failed to bind XAP2 (Fig. 3B). We conclude that the GAF-B domain of PDE2A is necessary and sufficient to mediate interaction with XAP2.FIGURE 3The GAF-B domain of PDE2A interacts with XAP2. A, PDE2A constructs. The scheme shows the PDE2A domain organization and indicates the size of deletion constructs used for binding site mapping experiments as shown in B. B, mapping of the XAP2 binding site of PDE2A. COS-1 cells were transfected with amino-terminally VSV-tagged PDE2A deletion constructs as shown in A. Cell lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection (input) and incubated with GST-XAP2 or GST coupled to beads for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed five times with lysis buffer before adding SDS buffer and boiling. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and identified by immunoblotting with mouse anti-VSV. Shown data are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Carboxyl Terminus of XAP2 Is Required for Binding to PDE2A—XAP2 is composed of an amino-terminal immunophilin homology domain and a TPR domain at the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 4A). TPR domains are known to mediate protein/protein interaction (10Carver L.A. LaPres J.J. Jain S. Dunham E.E. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33580-33587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To identify the region involved in the binding of XAP2 to PDE2A we constructed two GST fusion proteins containing the amino-terminal half-of XAP2 (N-XAP2) or its carboxyl terminus, including the TPR domain (C-XAP2). For control GST alone and full-length GST-XAP2 were used. Proteins were expressed in E. coli (Fig. 4B), affinity purified, and used to pull-down PDE2A from lysates of COS-1 cells transfected with the VSV-tagged full-length PDE2A construct. Fig. 4B demonstrates that all constructs migrated at their expected molecular weight. Full-length XAP2 and C-XAP2 bound to PDE2A, whereas GST alone and N-XAP2 did not (Fig. 4C). These data suggest that XAP2 interacts with PDE2A via its carboxyl-terminal domain, most likely via its TPR motif.FIGURE 4XAP2 binds PDE2A through its TPR domain. A, XAP2 constructs. The scheme shows the XAP2 domains and the amino-(N-XAP2) and carboxyl-terminal (C-XAP2) constructs used for pulldown experiments as shown in B and C. B, expression of XAP2 constructs.

COS-1 cells were transfected with VSV-tagged full-length PDE2A. Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection (PDE2A input) and incubated with GST-N-XAP2, GST-C-XAP2, GST-XAP2, or GST alone. Precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and bound PDE2A was identified by immunoblotting with mouse anti-VSV.

https://openalex.org/W2049703232,"Cholangiocarcinomas are devastating cancers of biliary origin with limited treatment options. Modulation of the endocannabinoid system is being targeted to develop possible therapeutic strategies for a number of cancers; therefore, we evaluated the effects of the two major endocannabinoids, anandamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol, on numerous cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. Although anandamide was antiproliferative and proapoptotic, 2-arachidonylglycerol stimulated cholangiocarcinoma cell growth. Specific inhibitors for each of the cannabinoid receptors did not prevent either of these effects nor did pretreatment with pertussis toxin, a Gi/o protein inhibitor, suggesting that anandamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol did not exert their diametric effects through any known cannabinoid receptor or through any other Gi/o protein-coupled receptor. Using the lipid raft disruptors methyl-β-cyclodextrin and filipin, we demonstrated that anandamide, but not 2-arachidonylglycerol, requires lipid raft-mediated events to inhibit cellular proliferation. Closer inspection of the lipid raft structures within the cell membrane revealed that although anandamide treatment had no observable effect 2-arachidonylglycerol treatment effectively dissipated the lipid raft structures and caused the lipid raft-associated proteins lyn and flotillin-1 to disperse into the surrounding membrane. In addition, anandamide, but not 2-arachidonylglycerol, induced an accumulation of ceramide, which was required for anandamide-induced suppression of cell growth. Finally we demonstrated that anandamide and ceramide treatment of cholangiocarcinoma cells recruited Fas and Fas ligand into the lipid rafts, subsequently activating death receptor pathways. These findings suggest that modulation of the endocannabinoid system may be a target for the development of possible therapeutic strategies for the treatment of this devastating cancer.

These findings suggest that modulation of the endocannabinoid system may be a target for the development of possible therapeutic strategies for the treatment of this devastating cancer. Cholangiocarcinomas are devastating cancers of intrahepatic and extrahepatic origin that are increasing in both their worldwide incidence and mortality rates (1Alpini G. Prall R.T. LaRusso N.F.

The challenges posed by these often lethal biliary tract cancers are daunting; conventional treatment options are limited, and the only hope for long term survival is that of complete surgical resection of the tumor (1Alpini G. Prall R.T. LaRusso N.F. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 421-435Google Scholar, 2Sirica A.E.

Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 421-435Google Scholar); therefore it is important to understand the cellular mechanisms of cholangiocarcinoma cell growth with a view to develop novel chemopreventive strategies. Marijuana and its derivatives have been used in medicine for many centuries, and presently there is an emerging renaissance in the study of the therapeutic effects of cannabinoids.

In addition, cannabinoids might be effective antitumoral agents because of their ability to inhibit the growth of various types of cancer cell lines in culture (8De Petrocellis L. Melck D.

The finding in the early 1990s of specific G-protein-coupled receptors for the psychoactive component of Cannabis sativa (-)-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (13Gaoni Y. Mechoulam R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) led to the discovery of a whole endogenous signaling system now known as the endocannabinoid system (14Bisogno T. Ligresti A. Di Marzo V. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 2005; 81: 224-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This system consists of the cannabinoid receptors (to date there are two, Cb1 2The abbreviations used are: Cb1, cannabinoid receptor 1; Cb2, cannabinoid receptor 2; 2-AG, 2-arachidonylglycerol; AEA, anandamide; BrdUrd, bro-modeoxyuridine; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; dnFADD, dominant negative FADD; DR, death receptor; FADD, Fas-associated death domain protein; MTS, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; VR1, vanilloid receptor; FasL, Fas ligand; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. and Cb2, as well as a putative involvement of the vanilloid receptor VR1), their endogenous ligands (endocannabinoids), and the proteins for their synthesis and inactivation (14Bisogno T. Ligresti A. Di Marzo V. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 2005; 81: 224-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The cannabinoid receptors are seven-transmembrane domain proteins coupled to the Gi/o type of G-proteins (14Bisogno T. Ligresti A. Di Marzo V. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 2005; 81: 224-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Cb1 receptors are found predominantly in the central nervous system but also in most peripheral tissues including immune cells, the reproductive system, the gastrointestinal tract, and the lung (15Devane W.A. Dysarz III, F.A. Johnson M.R. Melvin L.S. Howlett A.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 605-613PubMed Google Scholar, 16Matsuda L.A. Lolait S.J. Brownstein M.J. Young A.C. Bonner T.I.

On the other hand, Cb2 receptors are found predominantly in the immune system, i.e. in tonsils, spleen, macrophages, and lymphocytes (15Devane W.A. Dysarz III, F.A. Johnson M.R. Melvin L.S. Howlett A.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 605-613PubMed Google Scholar, 16Matsuda L.A. Lolait S.J. Brownstein M.J. Young A.C. Bonner T.I.

To date, many endocannabinoids have been identified with varying affinities for the receptors (18Di Marzo V. Deutsch D.G. Neurobiol. Dis. 1998; 5: 386-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Anandamide (AEA) was the first endogenous ligand to be identified (15Devane W.A. Dysarz III, F.A. Johnson M.R. Melvin L.S. Howlett A.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 605-613PubMed Google Scholar); it acts as a partial Cb1 agonist and weak Cb2 agonist. Another endocannabinoid is 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG), which activates both Cb1 and Cb2 receptors (19Mechoulam R. Ben-Shabat S. Hanus L. Ligumsky M. Kaminski N.E. Schatz A.R. Gopher A. Almog S.

The chemical structures of these two endocannabinoids are shown in Fig. 1. Although the physiological role of the many other ligands has not yet been fully clarified, AEA and 2-AG have been implicated in a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes. In addition to their cannabinoid receptor-mediated effects, endocannabinoids, and in particular AEA, are capable of mediating a plethora of receptor-independent cell signaling effects (21Siegmund S.V.

FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2157-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), most of which are via an interaction with cholesterolrich microdomains of the cell membrane, also known as lipid rafts (21Siegmund S.V.

Henichart J.P. Prostate. 2003; 56: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These lipid rafts are thought to provide a platform for signaling molecules to concentrate and efficiently interact thereby facilitating the subsequent signal transduction process (27Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar, 28Foster L.J. De Hoog C.L. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Indeed the subcellular localization of death receptors such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1, Fas, Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), and other receptors of the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand pathway are redistributed to lipid rafts in response to many apoptosis-inducing factors including a number of chemotherapeutic agents (29Gajate C.

In the present study, we show the opposing effects of AEA and 2-AG on cholangiocarcinoma cell growth that were cannabinoid receptor-independent. In addition, we show that AEA mediated its inhibitory effects on cell growth by stimulating the accumulation of ceramide, stabilization of lipid rafts, and the recruitment of Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) to the lipid rafts. Conversely 2-AG increased cholangiocarcinoma cell growth and disrupted the organization of the lipid raft structures in the cell membrane. Materials—Reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. AEA, 2-AG, and AM9810 were purchased from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). The cannabinoid receptor inhibitors SR141716 and SR144528 were obtained from the National Institute on Drug Abuse drug supply program (Bethesda, MD). Antibodies against Cb1 and Cb2 as well as C2-ceramide, C6-ceramide, and filipin III were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI).

The expression vector for dominant negative FADD was a kind gift from Dr. G. J. Gores (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN), and the human FADD shRNA plasmids and PCR primers were purchased from SuperArray (Frederick, MD). Cell Culture—We used four human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines (Mz-ChA-1, HuH-28, HuCC-T1, and SG231) with different origins. Mz-ChA-1 cells, from human gallbladder (33Knuth A. Gabbert H. Dippold W.

Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1990; 2: 300-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The human immortalized, nonmalignant cholangiocyte cell line H69 (from Dr. G. J Gores, Mayo Clinic) was cultured as described previously (38Grubman S.A. Perrone R.D. Lee D.W. Murray S.L. Rogers L.C. Wolkoff L.I. Mulberg A.E. Cherington V. Jefferson D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G1060-G1070PubMed Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—We evaluated the expression of the cannabinoid receptors by reverse transcription-PCR using total RNA (1 μg) from H69, Mz-ChA-1, HuH-28, HUCC-T1, and SG231 cholangiocarcinoma cells. cDNA synthesis was performed using the Reaction Ready™ first strand cDNA synthesis kit from SuperArray. For PCR, we used primers specific for human Cb1, Cb2, VR1, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Cb1: forward, 5′-ctggttctgatcctggtggt-3′; reverse, 5′-tgtctcaggtccttgctcct-3′; product size, 185 bp; Cb2: forward, 5′-gattggcagcgtgactatga-3′; reverse, 5′-gctgagaggacccacatgat-3′; product size, 159 bp; VR1: forward, 5′-gcctggagctgttcaagttc-3′; reverse, 5′-tctcctgtgcgatcttgttg-3′; product size, 177 bp). PCR was performed using the following thermocycler conditions: 5 min at 94 °C followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C followed by a prolonged extension step for 5 min at 72 °C. Ten microliters of each PCR product were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide and visualized using a ChemiImager low light imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Sequence analysis (Davis Sequencing, Davis, CA) indicated that the reverse transcription-PCR fragments for all cannabinoid receptors were homologous to their corresponding published sequence (GenBank™ accession numbers: human Cb1, AY995204; Cb2, NM_001841; and VR1, NM_080704). Immunoblots—Following trypsinization, H69, Mz-ChA-1, HuCC-T1, SG231, and HuH-28 cells (1 × 106) were resuspended in lysis buffer as described previously (35Kanno N. Glaser S. Chowdhury U.

Immunoblots to detect Cb1, Cb2, and VR1 receptor expression were performed as described previously (35Kanno N. Glaser S. Chowdhury U. Phinizy J.L. Baiocchi L. Francis H. LeSage G. Alpini G. J. Hepatol. 2001; 34: 284-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 39Kanno N. Lesage G. Phinizy J.L. Glaser S. Francis H. Alpini G. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 1329-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—We detected Cb1, Cb2, and VR1 receptor expression in H69, Mz-ChA-1, HuCC-T1, HuH-28, and SG231 cells. Cells were seeded into 6-well dishes containing a sterile coverslip on the bottom of each well. Cells were allowed to adhere overnight, washed once in cold PBS, fixed to the coverslip with 4% paraformaldehyde (in 1× PBS) at room temperature for 5 min, permeabilized in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBST), and blocked in 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBST for 1 h. Cb1, Cb2, and VR1 receptor antibodies were diluted (1:50 for Cb1 and VR1 antibodies and 1:100 for Cb2) in 1% BSA in PBST, added to the coverslips, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed 3 × 10 min in PBST, and a 1:50 dilution (in 1% BSA in PBST) of Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunochemicals, West Grove, PA) was added for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were washed again and mounted into microscope slides with Prolong Antifade Gold containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) as a counterstain (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Negative controls were done with the omission of the respective primary antibodies. Sections were visualized using an Olympus IX-71 inverted confocal microscope. Cell Proliferation Assays—Cholangiocarcinoma growth was evaluated by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxyme-thoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) proliferation assay in the Mz-ChA-1, HuCC-T1, HuH-28, and SG231 cell lines (40Fava G.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 11437-11446Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). After trypsinization, cells were seeded into 96-well plates (10,000 cells/well) in a final volume of 200 μl of medium. Cells were stimulated for 24, 48, and 72 h with AEA or 2-AG (1 nm to 10 μm). Cell proliferation was assessed using a colorimetric cell proliferation assay (CellTiter 96Aqueous, Promega Corp., Madison, WI), and absorbance was measured at 490 nm by a microplate spectrophotometer (Versamax, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). To determine possible mechanisms of action, Mz-ChA-1 cells were first preincubated for 1 h with various inhibitors prior to the addition of AEA or 2-AG for 48 h. The inhibitors utilized were SR141716 (a Cb1 antagonist, 10 nm (41Rinaldi-Carmona M. Barth F. Heaulme M. Shire D. Calandra B. Congy C. Martinez S. Maruani J. Neliat G. Caput D. Ferrara P. Soubrie P.

Statistical significance was determined using a t test, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Annexin V Labeling—Apoptosis was evaluated using Annexin V labeling of cells (50LeSage G. Alvaro D. Benedetti A. Glaser S. Marucci L. Baiocchi L. Eisel W. Caligiuri A. Phinizy J.L. Rodgers R. Francis H. Alpini G.

Mz-ChA-1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates (500,000 cells/well) containing sterile coverslips on the bottom of each well and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were stimulated with AEA (10 μm) or 2-AG (10 μm) for 24 h after which time coverslips were removed and rinsed in cold incubation buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2) to remove excess media. Coverslips were then incubated in a solution containing Annexin V-biotin complex (1:50 dilution in incubation buffer) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing the coverslips to remove excess Annexin V-biotin, the cells were fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) for 10 min. Bound Annexin V-biotin complex was detected with Cy2-labeled streptavidin (1:200 dilution in PBS), mounted onto microscope slides with Prolong Antifade Gold containing DAPI, and visualized using an Olympus IX-71 inverted confocal microscope. The number of Annexin V-positive cells was counted and expressed as a percentage of total cells in five random fields for each treatment group. Data are the average ± S.E. of five fields in three independent experiments. BrdUrd Labeling—BrdUrd labeling was used to evaluate the effects of AEA and 2-AG on cell cycle progression. Mz-ChA-1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates (500,000 cells/well) containing sterile coverslips on the bottom of each well and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were stimulated with AEA (10 μm) or 2-AG (10 μm) for 48 h after which time BrdUrd (10 μm final concentration) was added to each well and incubated for a further 3 h at 37 °C. The coverslips were removed, rinsed in PBS to remove excess media, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. DNA was denatured in 2 m HCl for 1 h at 37 °C and then neutralized with 0.5 m borate buffer (pH 9.5). The cell membranes were then permeabilized with PBST for 3 × 5 min. Nonspecific protein binding was then blocked with 4% BSA (in PBST) for 1 h at room temperature followed by a 2-h incubation with a 1:200 dilution (in 1% BSA in PBST) of anti-BrdUrd antibody. Coverslips were washed 3 × 5 min in PBST, and a 1:50 dilution (in 1% BSA in PBST) of Cy3-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody was added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Excess antibody was removed by further washing in PBST, and the coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides with Prolong Antifade Gold containing DAPI and visualized using an Olympus IX-71 inverted confocal microscope. The number of BrdUrd-positive nuclei was counted and expressed as a percentage of total cells in five random fields for each treatment group. Data are the average ± S.E. of five fields in three independent experiments. Lipid Raft Labeling—Lipid rafts were visualized using the Vybrant® lipid raft labeling kit (Molecular Probes) with modifications. Briefly Mz-ChA-1 cells were seeded onto sterile coverslips placed in the bottom of 6-well culture dishes and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were treated with vehicle, AEA, or 2-AG (both at 10 μm) for 4 h at 37 °C. Coverslips were then moved into new 6-well dishes for staining. Cells were incubated in the presence of 1 μg/ml (diluted in growth media) of fluorescent cholera toxin B subunit (Alexa Fluor 594 was the fluorochrome) for 15 min at 4 °C. This cholera toxin B subunit conjugate binds to the pentasaccharide chain of plasma membrane ganglioside GM1, which selectively partitions into lipid rafts (51Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 447-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 52Parton R.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). After this incubation, the cells were gently washed with chilled PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) for 15 min at 4 °C, washed again in PBS, mounted onto microscope slides with Prolong Antifade Gold containing DAPI, and visualized using an Olympus IX-71 inverted confocal microscope. In the lipid raft/Fas co-localization studies, the lipid rafts were stained and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde as described above. The cells were then counterstained with an antibody against the extracellular domain of Fas overnight at 4 °C under non-permeabilizing conditions (i.e. all washes were performed in PBS instead of PBST). Immunofluorescent staining of membranebound Fas was continued as described above using a Cy2-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Analysis of the degree of co-localization between lipid rafts and Fas immunoreactivity was performed using a Pearson's correlation analysis that is part of the FluoView imaging software from Olympus.

We took a systematic approach to characterize the functions of the six putative Class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K1–6) in Dictyostelium by creating a series of gene knockouts. These studies revealed that PI3K1–PI3K3 are the major PI3Ks for chemoattractant-mediated phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate production. We studied chemotaxis of the pi3k1/2/3 triple knock-out strain (pi3k1/2/3 null cells) to cAMP under two distinct experimental conditions, an exponential gradient emitted from a micropipette and a shallow, linear gradient in a Dunn chamber, using four cAMP concentrations ranging over a factor of 10,000. Under all conditions tested pi3k1/2/3 null cells moved slower and had less polarity than wild-type cells. pi3k1/2/3 null cells moved toward a chemoattractant emitted by a micropipette, although persistence was lower than that of wild-type or pi3k1/2 null cells. In shallow linear gradients, pi3k1/2 null cells had greater directionality defects, especially at lower chemoattractant concentrations. Our studies suggest that although PI3K is not essential for directional movement under some chemoattractant conditions, it is a key component of the directional sensing pathway and plays a critical role in linear chemoattractant gradients, especially at low chemoattractant concentrations. The relative importance of PI3K in chemotaxis is also dependent on the developmental stage of the cells. Our data suggest that the output of other signaling pathways suffices to mediate directional sensing when cells perceive a strong signal, but PI3K signaling is crucial for detecting weaker signals.

Chemotaxis, or directed cell movement in response to a small molecule ligand, is a basic process of many cell types and is essential for a variety of physiological processes including inflammatory responses, innate immunity, cellular morphogenesis, and metastasis of cancer cells (1Charest P.G.

Cells respond to a directional signal by extending the pseudopod or lamellipod in the direction of the chemoattractant gradient through the localized polymerization of F-actin. Coordinated with this response is retraction of the posterior of the cell via a myosin II-mediated pathway. Studies over the past few years have elucidated many of the molecular mechanisms controlling this response. One of the major findings is that key aspects of the regulatory mechanisms that control chemotaxis are similar in neutrophils and Dictyostelium cells, suggesting they are highly conserved through evolution. Class I PI3-kinases (PI3Ks) 4The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PH, pleckstrin homology; PI(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate; PI(3,4)P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-diphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; RBD, Ras binding domain; CRAC, cytosolic regulator of adenylyl cyclase. have been implicated in controlling chemotaxis in Dictyostelium, neutrophils, and macrophages. Initial studies in Dictyostelium followed by those in neutrophils and fibroblasts demonstrated that PI3K is locally activated at the leading edge of chemotaxing cells (5Haugh J.M. Codazzi F.

Cell. 1998; 95: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). These studies employed reporters in which GFP was fused to the PH domain of CRAC or Akt/PKB. These PH domains preferentially bind to the Class I PI3K products PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2. Real-time, dynamic PH domain localization studies demonstrated that the PH domain-containing proteins are cytosolic and rapidly localize to the site of the plasma membrane closest to the chemoattractant source. This localization is dependent on PI3K, as determined by sensitivity to the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and its absence in pi3k null cells. Null mutants of some Dictyostelium proteins with PIP3-responsive PH domains exhibit defects in cell movement and chemotaxis, suggesting that PI3K is involved in chemotaxis (7Meili R. Ellsworth C. Lee S. Reddy T.B. Ma H. Firtel R.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2092-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 9Meili R. Ellsworth C. Firtel R.A. Curr.

In Dictyostelium, the two previously studied PI3Ks, PI3K1 and PI3K2, have Ras binding domains, which are required for chemoattractant-stimulated PI3K activation (12Funamoto S. Meili R. Lee S. Parry L. Firtel R.A. Cell. 2002; 109: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Ras is rapidly activated at the leading edge (peaking at 3–4 s) (13Sasaki A.T. Chun C. Takeda K. Firtel R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Cells in which Ras function is abrogated have difficulty polarizing and, once they do, are unable to effectively sense the direction of the chemoattractant gradient and move randomly. The initial activation of Ras and PI3K is independent of F-actin polymerization. However, F-actin polymerization is essential for amplifying the signal and stabilizing the leading edge in neutrophils and Dictyostelium (13Sasaki A.T. Chun C. Takeda K. Firtel R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 14Wang F. Herzmark P. Weiner O.D. Srinivasan S. Servant G. Bourne H.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In Dictyostelium, F-actin recruits additional PI3K to the newly forming leading edge, enhancing the PIP3 response and downstream effector function (13Sasaki A.T. Chun C. Takeda K. Firtel R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 15Sasaki A.T. Firtel R.A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 873-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Cells with decreased PI3K activity exhibit a decrease in the second peak of RacB activation and F-actin polymerization, which has been linked to pseudopod extension. Dictyostelium cells lacking two of the Class I PI3Ks (pi3k1/2 null cells) show defects in directionality under some experimental conditions, although these cells can still move toward the chemoattractant source (10Funamoto S. Milan K. Meili R. Firtel R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 795-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). pi3k1/2 null cells developed for 5 h have reduced polarity and produce lateral pseudopodia; however, under other developmental conditions this strain behaves indistinguishably from wild-type cells (16Loovers H.M. Postma M. Keizer-Gunnink I. Huang Y.E. Devreotes P.N. van Haastert P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1503-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Neutrophils lacking PI3Kγ or in which PI3Kγ has been inhibited by drugs that show specificity for this Class I PI3K isoform exhibit decreased directionality of cell movement (14Wang F. Herzmark P.

Studies using LY294002 have provided contradictory results in a variety of cell types (21Chung C.Y. Funamoto S. Firtel R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 557-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In Dictyostelium, brief treatment with LY294002 renders cells unable to effectively sense the direction of the chemoattractant source; however, after 5 or more min, these cells become polarized and move up a strong chemoattractant gradient (10Funamoto S. Milan K. Meili R. Firtel R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 795-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 16Loovers H.M. Postma M. Keizer-Gunnink I. Huang Y.E. Devreotes P.N. van Haastert P.J. Mol.

Carcinoma cells employ a phospholipase C/cofilin-mediated directional signaling pathway while incorporating PI3K as an important component for the secondary F-actin response (27Mouneimne G. Soon L.

Evidence from studies in carcinoma and Dictyostelium cells has implicated PI3K in the control of F-actin polymerization (28Hill K. Welti S. Yu J. Murray J.T. Yip S.C. Condeelis J.S. Segall J.E.

Cell. 2003; 14: 5028-5037Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In response to a global (uniform) stimulation of cells in suspension, Dictyostelium and mammalian cells show a biphasic F-actin polymerization response. There is an initial rapid and transient peak (∼5 s in Dictyostelium) followed by a rapid decrease in F-actin polymerization and a subsequent slower rise producing a broad peak at ∼30–60 s. The second peak has been linked to the extension of the pseudopod and is dependent on PI3K in both Dictyostelium and carcinoma cells (28Hill K. Welti S. Yu J. Murray J.T. Yip S.C. Condeelis J.S.

Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 5028-5037Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). pi3k1/2 null cells (developed for 5 h) and LY294002-treated wild-type cells have reduced RacB activation that has been linked to F-actin polymerization in the Dictyostelium strain KAx-3. pten null cells, which exhibit elevated and temporally extended PI(3/4)P2/PI(3,4,5)P3 accumulation, have elevated levels of the second peak of RacB activation and F-actin polymerization (30Park K.C. Rivero F. Meili R. Lee S. Apone F. Firtel R.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4177-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To further elucidate and define the roles of PI3K in chemotaxis, we have undertaken a more detailed analysis of the role of PI3Ks in Dictyostelium. Examination of the completed Dictyostelium genome has identified six Class I PI3Ks (this manuscript and Ref. 31Janetopoulos C. Borleis J. Vazquez F. Iijima M. Devreotes P. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 467-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). By creating single, double, and some triple knock-out mutations, we have genetically titrated the level of functional PI3K in Dictyostelium cells. We used these cells to study chemotaxis in response to a point source of chemoattractant (chemoattractant emitted from a micropipette), which produces an exponential gradient (very steep near the micropipette and flat far from the micropipette), and cells responding to a linear gradient of chemoattractant produced using a two-well chemotaxis chamber (Dunn chamber). Our studies indicate that as one decreases the level of functional PI3K in cells, the chemotaxis phenotypes become more severe. A triple PI3K1/2/3 knock-out strain that can respond to a steep chemoattractant gradient is unable to effectively chemotax to a shallow, linear gradient, exhibiting defects in directionality of cell movement. We found that the defects are also dependent on the concentration of the chemoattractant and the developmental stage of Dictyostelium cells. We suggest PI3K is a component of a complex cellular compass whose integrated function is to control the directional response of the cell. Cell Culture and Development—The Dictyostelium strain KAx-3 was grown in axenic HL5 medium and transformed by electroporation. For gene disruption we selected cells in the presence of blasticidin or hygromycin. Gene Identification and Sequence Analysis—The dictyBase (dictybase.org) was screened for other putative PI3Ks using the kinase domain of PI3K1, PI3K2, or PI3K3 (GenBank™ accession numbers U23476, U23477, and XM_638728, respectively). We identified three additional putative Class I PI3Ks, DDB0216567, DDB0204875, and DDB0189237. We named DDB0216567 as PI3K4, DDB0204875 as PI3K5, and DDB0189237 as PI3K6 (GenBank™ accession numbers XM_642316, XM_635069, and XM_630307, respectively), BLAST, Smart, and SCAN programs were used to analyze the obtained sequences. Alignments were made using ClustalW. Gene Disruption—Gene inactivation was obtained by replacing part of the gene with the Bsr or Hyg cassette. The cassette was inserted into the BamHI site (nucleotide 3435 from ATG on genomic DNA) of PI3K3, the BglII site (nucleotide 3096) of PI3K4, the EcoRV site (nucleotide 3811) of PI3K5, and the BglII site (nucleotide 4093) of PI3K6. Potential knockouts were screened by PCR and confirmed by Southern blot analyses. Chemotaxis and Image Acquisition—The analyses of chemotaxis toward cAMP were done as described previously (10Funamoto S. Milan K. Meili R. Firtel R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 795-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 13Sasaki A.T. Chun C. Takeda K. Firtel R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and analyzed with the DIAS program (32Wessels D. Voss E. Von Bergen N. Burns R. Stites J. Soll D.R. Cell. Motil. Cytoskel. 1998; 41: 225-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To obtain developmentally competent cells capable of responding to cAMP as a chemoattractant, log-phase vegetative cells were washed once, resuspended at a density 5 × 106 cells/ml, and pulsed with cAMP for 5–7 h (time of pulsing is indicated in each figure legend) at 6-min intervals. We added LY294002 to a final concentration of 50 μm 20 min before real-time recording of chemotaxis toward the micropipette emitting the chemoattractant. Biochemical Assay—Akt/PKB activity was measured as described previously (7Meili R. Ellsworth C. Lee S. Reddy T.B. Ma H. Firtel R.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2092-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Extended Treatment of Cells with the Chemoattractant cAMP Partially Rescues pi3k1/2 Null Cell Chemotaxis Defects—The chemotactic responsiveness of Dictyostelium cells to the chemoattractant cAMP is a developmentally regulated process in which the expression of both the major cAMP chemoattractant receptor (cAR1) and the coupled Gα subunit (Gα2) is very low during vegetative growth and is induced to high levels during the early stages of development before aggregation (33Kimmel A.R. Parent C.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1525-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 34Aubry L. Firtel R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 469-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In addition to acting as a chemoattractant, cAMP induces this developmental program, which controls the aggregation of cells to form a multicellular organism, and regulates a signal relay system to activate adenylyl cyclase and, thus, transiently increase its own synthesis. This developmental pathway can be induced in cell suspension by pulsing cells with exogenous cAMP to mimic the endogenous signal produced by cells during normal development (35Insall R.H. Soede R.D. Schaap P. Devreotes P.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This cell suspension system is generally employed to obtain “developmentally competent” cells able to respond to cAMP for use in chemotaxis assays. Wild-type cells pulsed with cAMP for 5 h (using the protocol described previously (10Funamoto S. Milan K. Meili R. Firtel R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 795-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar)) are fully competent to respond to cAMP, maximally induce known signaling pathways required for chemotaxis (F-actin polymerization, myosin II assembly, and Akt/PKB activation), and maximally induce cAMP-mediated early gene expression (10Funamoto S. Milan K. Meili R. Firtel R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 795-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These cells become highly polarized when placed in a chemoattractant gradient and chemotax with a speed equal to that of cells pulsed for a longer time (7 h; data not shown). When a micropipette containing a chemoattractant is placed on the lateral side of a 5-h pulsed, polarized, chemotaxing cell, the cell changes direction predominantly by producing a new pseudopod at the side of the cell closest to the micropipette (10Funamoto S. Milan K. Meili R. Firtel R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 795-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Such cells produce a localized activation of Ras and PI3K, as observed through the localization of GFP-Ras binding domain fusion and GFP fusion of a PH domain-containing protein (CRAC, Akt/PKB, PhdA) at the side of the membrane closest to the micropipette (13Sasaki A.T. Chun C. Takeda K. Firtel R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This site becomes the site of localized F-actin polymerization and the formation of a new pseudopod. Thus, these cells are highly plastic in that they are able to rapidly change direction through the activation of “leading edge responses” at the side of the cell closest to the micropipette and through the formation of the new pseudopod at this site. When wild-type cells are pulsed for 7 h, they can become highly polarized even in the absence of an exogenous chemoattractant signal, presumably due to the high endogenous production and secretion of cAMP, as this does not happen with adenylyl cyclase null cells (36Kriebel P.W. Barr V.A. Parent C.A. Cell. 2003; 112: 549-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 37Devreotes P. Janetopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20445-20448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Wild-type cells pulsed for 7 h readily form head-to-tail streams of cells that prevent effective analysis of single cells. Seven-hour-pulsed cells also tend to turn by changing the direction of the leading edge when the position of the micropipette is moved (unless it is very close to the cells) rather than inducing a new leading edge at the side of the cell, indicating these cells have a very stable leading edge. We previous characterized the chemotactic behavior of pi3k1/2 null cells pulsed for 5 h, which exhibit wild-type levels of pulse-induced gene expression, using a micropipette filled with 150 μm cAMP to produce a chemoattractant gradient (10Funamoto S. Milan K. Meili R. Firtel R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 795-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). As in previous reports, 5-h-pulsed pi3k1/2 null cells are more rounded and move more slowly and with poorer directionality than wild-type cells (summarized in Fig. 1A, data not shown). Because of the controversy on the chemotaxis phenotypes of pi3k1/2 null cells in the literature (16Loovers H.M. Postma M. Keizer-Gunnink I. Huang Y.E. Devreotes P.N. van Haastert P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1503-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of extending pulsing (development) on the pi3k1/2 null cell phenotypes. Seven-hour-pulsed pi3k1/2 null cells do not readily form streams, presumably because of defects in the activation of adenylyl cyclase (38Comer F.I. Parent C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which allows one to examine the effect of increased pulsing on the chemotaxis behavior of these cells. As shown in Fig. 2, pi3k1/2 null cells pulsed for 7 h move as well as wild-type cells with respect to speed and directionality, consistent with recently published results (16Loovers H.M. Postma M. Keizer-Gunnink I. Huang Y.E. Devreotes P.N. van Haastert P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1503-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, we find that longer pulsing rescues the pi3k1/2 null cell chemotaxis defects. Cyclic AMP-stimulated Akt/PKB activation, which is reduced to ∼16% that of wild-type cells, is unaffected by increased pulsing (Fig. 1A and B; data not shown; Ref. 10Funamoto S. Milan K. Meili R. Firtel R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 795-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), suggesting that the behavioral difference between 5- and 7-h-pulsed cells is not due to an increase in PI3K activity. These findings suggest that the difference in chemotaxis behavior between 5- and 7-h-pulsed cells may be due to one or more PI3K-independent pathways involved in controlling directional movement and that this difference may be associated with different developmental timing.FIGURE 2Chemotactic behavior of wild-type, pi3k1/2, and pi3k1/2/3 null cells with and without LY294002 treatment.

For treatment with LY294002, cells were incubated with 50 μm LY294002 for 20 min before inserting the micropipette. The drug was also present during the time of the recording. The depictions of the pathways and shapes of chemotaxing cells were obtained using DIAS computer software (32Wessels D. Voss E. Von Bergen N. Burns R. Stites J. Soll D.R. Cell. Motil.

Takegawa K. Emr S.D. Firtel R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5645-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Three additional genes were revealed in the recently completed Dictyostelium genome sequence project (Fig. 3, A and B; Ref. 31Janetopoulos C. Borleis J. Vazquez F. Iijima M. Devreotes P. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 467-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). PI3K1–5 have a long N-terminal domain, a Ras binding domain (RBD), a C2-domain, a kinase accessory domain, and a kinase catalytic domain, similar to metazoan Class I PI3Ks. Analysis of the kinase domains indicates that PI3K1 and PI3K2 are most closely related to human Class Ia and Ib PI3Ks, whereas the PI3K6 kinase domain is most closely related to that of the Class III PI3K VPS34. PI3K6 lacks an RBD but has a PH domain in approximately the same location as the RBD in PI3K1–5 (Fig. 3A). The PI3K6 PH domain shows sequence divergence from PH domains known to preferentially bind PI(3,4)P2/PI(3,4,5)P3. Some PH domains bind lipids and a number of PH domain-containing proteins, including those that preferentially bind PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3, localize to the cortex in response to chemoattractant stimulation. We created a GFP-PI3K6 PH domain fusion and examined its subcellular localization in unstimulated and stimulated cells. The reporter remained cytosolic in all assays and did not bind PI(3,4)P2 or PI(3,4,5)P3 in lipid dot blot assays (data not shown). We demonstrated previously that there is a low level of PI3K1 and PI3K2 at the cell cortex, which dramatically increases in response to chemoattractant stimulation (13Sasaki A.T. Chun C. Takeda K. Firtel R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In response to global stimulation, this translocation is transient and is dependent on F-actin polymerization but not dependent on the RBD or the C-terminal C2 or catalytic domains. To examine whether this dynamic subcellular localization is general for the Dictyostelium Class I PI3Ks, we examined PI3K3, another member of this family that contains a RBD, and PI3K6, which has a PH domain and no RBD. We found that PI3K3 exhibits a subcellular localization profile similar to those of PI3K1 and PI3K2; GFP-PI3K3 is predominantly cytosolic and rapidly translocates to the cortex upon chemoattractant stimulation (data not shown). Furthermore, PI3K3 localizes to the leading edge in chemotaxing cells (Fig. 4A). In contrast, PI3K6 shows a significant cortical localization in unstimulated cells. Unexpectedly, PI3K6 becomes localized to the posterior of polarized, chemotaxing cells (Fig. 4B), similar to the localization of p21-activated kinase A and adenylyl cyclase A, the adenylyl cyclase that produces cAMP during aggregation (38Comer F.I. Parent C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PI3K3 Is a Third PI3K Implicated in PIP3 Production by cAMP Stimulation—We examined the effect of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 on chemotaxis. Within 1 min of addition, drug-treated cells round up and are unresponsive to chemoattractant.

https://openalex.org/W2051656237,"Loss of parkin function is a predominant cause of familial Parkinsonism. Emerging evidence also suggests that parkin expression variability may confer a risk for sporadic Parkinson disease. We have recently demonstrated that a wide variety of Parkinson disease-linked stressors, including dopamine (DA), induce parkin solubility alterations and promote its aggregation within the cell, a phenomenon that may underlie the progressive susceptibility of the brain to degeneration. The vulnerability of parkin to stress-induced modification is likely due to its abundance of cysteine residues. Here, we performed a comprehensive mutational analysis and demonstrate that Cys residues residing both within and outside of the RING-IBR (in between RING fingers)-RING domain of parkin are important in maintaining its solubility. The majority of these Cys residues are highly conserved in parkin across different species and potentially fulfil important structural roles. Further, we found that both parkin and HHARI (human homologue of Drosophila ariadne), another RING-IBR-RING-type ubiquitin ligase, are comparably more susceptible to solubility alterations induced by oxidative and nitrosative stress when compared with other non-RING-IBR-RING Cys-containing enzymes. However, parkin appears to be uniquely sensitive to DA-mediated stress, the specificity of which is likely due to DA modification of 2 Cys residues on parkin (Cys-268 and Cys-323) that are distinct from other RING-IBR-RING members."

This molecule antagonizes the function of membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) to promote proMMP-2 maturation. Here, we attempt to clarify the mechanism underlying RECK functions. First, we found that RECK forms a complex with MT1-MMP and inhibits its proteolytic activity. Notably, RECK increases the amount of MT1-MMP that associates with detergent-resistant membranes during sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Furthermore, perturbation of membrane cholesterol significantly affected the function of RECK in suppressing MT1-MMP function. These findings indicate that RECK possibly regulates MT1-MMP function by modulating its behavior on the cell surface as well as by enzymatic action; this prompted us to find another molecule whose behavior in detergent-resistant membranes is influenced by RECK. Subsequently, we found that RECK interacts with CD13/aminopeptidase N. Further, we found that RECK inhibits the proteolytic activity of CD13 in a cholesterol perturbation-sensitive manner. Finally, we examined whether RECK influences the behavior of MT1-MMP and CD13 during their internalization from the cell surface. In the absence of RECK, MT1-MMP and CD13 were internalized along with the markers of clathrin- or caveolae-dependent endocytosis. However, interestingly, in the presence of RECK these molecules were internalized preferentially with an endocytic marker that is neither clathrinnor caveolae-dependent, indicating that RECK modulates endocytic pathways of MT1-MMP and CD13. This modulation was correlated with the accelerated internalization and decay of MT1-MMP and CD13. This study unveils the novel function and target molecules of RECK.

Clinically, it has been revealed that in many types of cancer the expression level of RECK is highly correlated with invasiveness of the tumor and prognosis of the tumor host (see references in Ref. 4Rabien A.

The structural basis of RECK function is currently under extensive investigation. RECK contains domains that are similar to those shared by Kazal-type serine protease inhibitors; however, the electric charge of the amino acid residues constituting the prospective P1 site in these domains of RECK is completely different from that of others, and thus far there is no evidence of serine protease inhibitor function of RECK (1Takahashi C.

Subsequently, the current investigation implicates that RECK contains domains functionally similar to the substrates of MMPs 5Y. Takegami and C. Takahashi, unpublished observation.5Y. Takegami and C. Takahashi, unpublished observation. as in the case of α2-macroglobulin, which is a major plasma inhibitor of metalloproteases (8Baker A.H. Edwards D.R. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3719-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). As compared with soluble MMP inhibitors represented by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) (8Baker A.H. Edwards D.R. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3719-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar), the most distinguishing feature of RECK is its ability to covalently anchor to the membrane surface via a post-translational modification (glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor) that is conserved among species (1Takahashi C. Sheng Z. Horan T.P. Kitayama H. Maki M. Hitomi K. Kitaura Y. Takai S. Sasahara R.M. Horimoto A. Ikawa Y. Ratzkin B.J. Arakawa T. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13221-13226Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). In contrast to RECK-deficient mice, deletion of any TIMP genes had little impact on embryonic development (3Oh J. Takahashi R. Kondo S. Mizoguchi A. Adachi E. Sasahara R.M. Nishimura S. Imamura Y. Kitayama H. Alexander D.B. Ide C. Horan T.P. Arakawa T. Yoshida H. Nishikawa S. Itoh Y. Seiki M. Itohara S. Takahashi C. Noda M.

In this work, we hypothesize that the membrane anchoring of RECK assigns unknown active roles to this molecule in addition to rendering it highly accessible to membrane-bound MMPs. In consonance, a soluble mutant of RECK that lacks the hydrophobic domain at the carboxyl-terminal failed to attenuate the proteolytic activity of MT1-MMP when introduced into HT1080 cells, 6C. Takahashi, unpublished observation.6C. Takahashi, unpublished observation. suggesting that the membrane anchoring is required for RECK to exert its function to antagonize MT1-MMP. MT1-MMP directly degrades various components of the extracellular matrix (9Itoh Y. Seiki M. J. Cell Physiol. 2006; 206: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). CD44, αv-integrin, and syndecan-1 are also substrates of MT1-MMP; the shedding of these molecules significantly affects cell motility through various mechanisms (9Itoh Y. Seiki M. J. Cell Physiol. 2006; 206: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MT1-MMP directly processes proMMP-2 and proMMP-13 and brings about their activation (9Itoh Y. Seiki M. J. Cell Physiol. 2006; 206: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 10Osenkowski P. Toth M. Fridman R. J. Cell Physiol. 2004; 200: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). TIMP-2 has been identified as its soluble inhibitor (8Baker A.H. Edwards D.R. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3719-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Further, TIMP-2 facilitates the activation of proMMP-2 by MT1-MMP via ternary complex formation (11Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar). Because RECK overexpression significantly suppressed MT1-MMP-dependent activation of proMMP-2 in cultured cells (3Oh J. Takahashi R. Kondo S. Mizoguchi A. Adachi E. Sasahara R.M. Nishimura S. Imamura Y. Kitayama H. Alexander D.B. Ide C. Horan T.P. Arakawa T. Yoshida H. Nishikawa S. Itoh Y. Seiki M. Itohara S. Takahashi C. Noda M. Cell. 2001; 107: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), RECK has been proposed to be an inhibitor of MT1-MMP; however, no direct evidence and mechanism have been provided. Because of the membrane-tethering ability of MT1-MMP, it undergoes a unique mode of post-translational regulation that is initiated by internalization. Recent studies indicate that MT1-MMP internalization is controlled by a clathrin- or caveolae-dependent endocytic pathway or by a combination of these two pathways (12Annabi B. Lachambre M.

These mechanisms contribute to the selective internalization of MT1-MMP from a specific compartment of the cell membrane and its sorting to endosomes for subsequent degradation or recycling (9Itoh Y. Seiki M. J. Cell Physiol. 2006; 206: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 10Osenkowski P. Toth M. Fridman R. J. Cell Physiol. 2004; 200: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This machinery appeared to be implicated in the control of proMMP-2 maturation and cell motility (14Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This interaction appeared to modulate the mechanism of MT1-MMP internalization when the cells were exposed to β1 integr in-dependent extracellular matrices (18Galvez B.G. Matias-Roman S. Yanez-Mo M. Sanchez-Madrid F. Arroyo A.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that cell surface molecules can participate in regulating MT1-MMP internalization and thereby influence cell behavior. CD13/aminopeptidase N (APN) is another membrane protease whose gene transcription is up-regulated by the ras oncogene product (19Bhagwat S.V. Petrovic N. Okamoto Y. Shapiro L.H. Blood. 2003; 101: 1818-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This molecule functions as a metal-dependent ectopeptidase that is involved in processing angiotensins, met-enkephalin, neurokinin A, somatostatin, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, and macrophage inhibitory protein (MIP)-1, and it also acts as a receptor for viruses, including coronavirus 229E that, in turn, mediates infection by human cytomegalovirus (20Riemann D.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Hence, this molecule is expected to play pivotal roles in tumor progression, angiogenesis, the cardiovascular system, immune systems, and in viral infection. The treatment of animals or cells using synthetic inhibitors of CD13 (e.g. bestatin, amastatin, and actinonin) or the anti-CD13 antibody resulted in abnormalities in various biological systems, i.e. cell proliferation and survival, blood pressure, cytokine levels, angiogenesis, and vasculogenesis (20Riemann D.

Although the mechanism is unclear, the anti-CD13 antibody suppresses type IV collagen degradation by tumor cells (HT1080 cells) and thereby inhibits their invasion (23Saiki I. Fujii H. Yoneda J. Abe F. Nakajima M. Tsuruo T. Azuma I. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 54: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Unlike MT1-MMP, no endogenous inhibitor of CD13 has been discovered thus far. Here, we report that RECK forms complex with MT1-MMP and CD13, competitively inhibits their proteolytic activities, and influences their behavior on the cell surface. In addition, this study demonstrates that RECK is internalized most likely via a recently identified novel endocytic pathway that involves the GPI-anchored protein enriched early endosomal compartments (GEECs) (24Sabharanjak S. Sharma P. Parton R.G. Mayor S. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 411-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Previous reports indicated that the internalization of MT1-MMP is clathrin- and/or caveolae-dependent (13Remacle A. Murphy G. Roghi C. J.

Production and Purification of Recombinant RECK—293F (Invitrogen) cells were transfected with pCXN2-hRECK1-941-His6, and the culture supernatants were recovered as the protein source. Purification of the product was performed by using a Hi-trap chelating column (GE Healthcare) and FPLC (Bio-Rad). The purity of this material was ∼97%. Kinetics of MT1-MMP Inhibition—To study the kinetics of MT1-MMP inhibition, 58 ng of recombinant soluble catalytic domain of MT1-MMP (S.E.-259; BIOMOL) was mixed with various concentrations of a labeled synthetic peptide Mca-Lys-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 (0.75-6.75 nm; ES010; R&D Systems) and recombinant soluble RECK protein (0-13.3 nm) in 200 ml of assay buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm ZnCl2, 0.1% Brij-35, and 0.1% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000. The output signal (excitation wavelength, 325 nm; emission wavelength, 393 nm) was recorded for 2 min at 37 °C by using SPECTRAmax (Molecular Devices). The dissociation constant Ki was calculated as described previously (1Takahashi C. Sheng Z. Horan T.P. Kitayama H. Maki M. Hitomi K. Kitaura Y. Takai S. Sasahara R.M. Horimoto A. Ikawa Y.

Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation—Protein fractionation by sucrose gradient centrifugation was performed as described previously (30Legler D.F. Micheau O. Doucey M.A. Tschopp J. Bron C. Immunity. 2003; 18: 655-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The anti-clathrin (610499; BD Biosciences) and anti-caveolin-1 (610059; BD Biosciences) antibodies were used. The distribution of the proteins of interest to detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) was estimated by quantifying the intensity of the bands obtained after immunoblotting by using NIH image (ver. 1.61). In each transfectant, MBCD (C4767; Sigma)-treated cells were set to zero. Gelatin Zymography—2 × 104 cells were plated on a 12-well-type dish and incubated for 48 h before starting preparation of culture supernatants that were prepared by incubating the cells with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 2.5 h and subsequently with 0.1% fetal calf serum for another 24 h. The culture supernatants from the final 24-h incubation were analyzed as described previously (1Takahashi C. Sheng Z. Horan T.P. Kitayama H. Maki M. Hitomi K. Kitaura Y. Takai S. Sasahara R.M.

The cell number after the final 24-h incubation was estimated by using the cell number-counting reagent SF (07553; Nacalai tesque) that was used for adjusting loading volume. Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometric identification of proteins was performed by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry as described previously (31Oda A.

Aminopeptidase Assay and Kinetics—Transfected cells (1 × 104 cells) were grown in a 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plate for 24 h and successively treated with or without bestatin (B8385; Sigma) at 37 °C. After 6 h of incubation, alanine-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (Peptide Institute) (32Aozuka Y. Koizumi K. Saitoh Y. Ueda Y. Sakurai H. Saiki I. Cancer Lett. 2004; 216: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) was added to the wells as the substrate at a final concentration of 0.2 mm. The cells were incubated for another 10 min, and the plate was then chilled at 0 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was collected, cleared by centrifugation, and subjected to fluorometric analysis of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (excitation wavelength, 360 nm; emission wavelength, 440 nm) (32Aozuka Y. Koizumi K. Saitoh Y. Ueda Y. Sakurai H. Saiki I. Cancer Lett. 2004; 216: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The nonspecific (basal) fluorescence level was determined by analyzing the sample in the presence of a saturating amount (5 μg/ml) of anti-CD13-blocking antibody (WM15: BD Biosciences), and this value was set to zero. Embryonic cells were prepared from E10.0 RECK null embryos or wild type littermates as described previously (3Oh J. Takahashi R. Kondo S. Mizoguchi A. Adachi E. Sasahara R.M. Nishimura S. Imamura Y.

https://openalex.org/W2058879047,"The basic structure of receptive fields and functional maps in primary visual cortex is established without exposure to normal sensory experience and before the onset of the critical period. How the brain wires these circuits in the early stages of development remains unknown. Possible explanations include activity-dependent mechanisms driven by spontaneous activity in the retina and thalamus, and molecular guidance orchestrating thalamo-cortical connections on a fine spatial scale. Here I propose an alternative hypothesis: the blueprint for receptive fields, feature maps, and their inter-relationships may reside in the layout of the retinal ganglion cell mosaics along with a simple statistical connectivity scheme dictating the wiring between thalamus and cortex. The model is shown to account for a number of experimental findings, including the relationship between retinotopy, orientation maps, spatial frequency maps and cytochrome oxidase patches. The theory's simplicity, explanatory and predictive power makes it a serious candidate for the origin of the functional architecture of primary visual cortex."

The most deleterious point mutation is the L166P substitution, which resides in a structure motif comprising two α-helices (G and H) separated by a kink. Here we subjected the C-terminal helix-kink-helix motif to systematic site-directed mutagenesis, introducing helix-incompatible proline residues as well as conservative substitutions into the helical interface. Furthermore, we generated deletion mutants lacking the H-helix, the kink, and the entire C terminus. When transfected into neural and nonneural cell lines, steady-state levels of G-helix breaking and kink deletion mutants were dramatically lower than wild-type DJ-1. The effects of H-helix breakers were comparably smaller, and the non-helix breaking mutants only slightly destabilized DJ-1. The decreased steady-state levels were due to accelerated protein degradation involving in part the proteasome. G-helix breaking DJ-1 mutations abolished dimer formation. These structural perturbations had functional consequences on the cytoprotective activities of DJ-1. The destabilizing mutations conferred reduced cytoprotection against H2O2 in transiently retransfected DJ-1 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The loss of survival promoting activity of the DJ-1 mutants with destabilizing C-terminal mutations correlated with impaired anti-apoptotic signaling. We found that wild-type, but not mutant DJ-1 facilitated the Akt pathway and simultaneously blocked the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, with which DJ-1 interacted in a redox-dependent manner. Thus, the G-helix and kink are critical determinants of the C-terminal helix-kink-helix motif, which is absolutely required for stability and the regulation of survival-promoting redox signaling of the Parkinson disease-associated protein DJ-1.

To investigate the structural and functional importance of individual side chains and the overall topology of the DJ-1 C terminus, we introduced helix-breaking proline residues at selected sites within the G-helix and H-helix. As controls, we introduced helix-compatible substitutions at the same positions. Moreover, we inserted deletions into the helix-kink-helix region. We report that secondary structure perturbing mutations in the G-helix and kink specifically destabilized the DJ-1 dimer. The instable PD-associated [L166P]DJ-1 as well as our novel synthetic G-helix breaking [V169P]DJ-1 and kink deletion mutants failed to protect DJ-1 ko mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) against H2O2 toxicity. Consistently, these DJ-1 mutants did not facilitate the stimulatory phosphorylation of the pro-survival kinase Akt and failed to repress ASK1. Thus, topology of the C-terminal helix-kink-helix motif is essential for protein stability and survival promoting activities of DJ-1. Molecular Display—The atom coordinates of the 1.95-Å resolution crystal structure of the DJ-1 dimer (23Honbou K. Suzuki N.N. Horiuchi M. Niki T. Taira T. Ariga H. Inagaki F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31380-31384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) were down-loaded from the Protein Data Bank (Protein Data Bank code 1PDW) and visualized with PyMOL. Site-directed Mutagenesis—For the generation of C-terminal V5-tagged DJ-1 mutants, [wt]DJ-1/V5 (17Görner K. Holtorf E. Odoy S. Nuscher B. Yamamoto A. Regula J.T. Beyer K. Haass C. Kahle P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6943-6951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) was used as template for two independent PCRs with the following primer pairs: forward mutagenesis primer (see supplementary table) and BamHI-Stop reverse primer, 5′-ATCTGGATCCGTCTTTAAGAACAAGTGGAGCC-3′, and for the second PCR reverse mutagenesis primer (see supplementary table) and NcoI forward primer, 5′-AACCATGGGAATGGCTTCCAAAAGAGCTCTG-3′. These two PCR products were then used as templates for a PCR using NcoI forward primer (see above) and BamHI-Stop reverse primer (see above). Mutagenized PCR products were subcloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen). To generate N-terminal MYC-tagged DJ-1 mutants, first PCR products were also used as templates for a PCR with EcoRI forward primer, 5′-ACGAATTCGAATGGCTTCCAAAAGAGCTCTGGT-3′, and NotI reverse primer, 5′-AGCGGCCGCGTCTTTAAGAACAAGTGGAGCC-3′. These PCR products were subcloned into pCMV-Myc (Clontech). Kink deletions were sequentially introduced. First, an in-frame point deletion of Gly174 was generated using EcoRI forward primer and NotI reverse primer (see above) and the mutagenesis primers specified in the supplementary table. This MYC/[ΔG174]DJ-1 construct then served as a template for deletion of codon 173 following the same strategy, yielding the double mutant MYC/[Δkink]DJ-1. All constructs were sequence confirmed (GATC, Konstanz, Germany). Determination of Steady-state DJ-1 Levels—Human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells, rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, and MEFs were grown to near confluence in Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium (MEM) plus 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Transient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (DNA:lipid ratio, 1:2.5) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection, cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) plus Cømplete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Protein content in the lysates was determined with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. After denaturing 15% PAGE, proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). DJ-1 was detected on Western blots with mouse monoclonal antibodies against the epitope tags, anti-V5 (Invitrogen) and 9E10 anti-MYC (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA), or polyclonal rabbit antisera (see below). Equal loading was confirmed by reprobing blots with anti-α-tubulin (Sigma). Secondary antibodies used were peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (Sigma). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Generation of DJ-1 Antisera—Rabbit polyclonal antiserum 3407 against DJ-1 protein was generated by injecting 400 μg of recombinant human full-length [wt]DJ-1/HIS, which was expressed in Escherichia coli and chromatography purified as described previously (17Görner K. Holtorf E. Odoy S. Nuscher B. Yamamoto A. Regula J.T. Beyer K. Haass C. Kahle P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6943-6951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Another rabbit polyclonal antiserum was generated against the extreme C-terminal peptide DJ-1 (167-189). The peptide AIVEALNGKEVAAQVKAPLVLKD was synthesized by the solid-phase method using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry at 90% purity and validated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The peptide was then conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin at the N-terminal end and used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits in a standard 90-day immunization protocol. Following enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to determine the titer, the antibody was purified using peptide immunoaffinity chromatography. Determination of DJ-1 mRNA—Total RNA was extracted from transfected cells with TRIzol (peQLab, Erlangen, Germany) and reverse transcribed using SuperScript II and oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen). The resulting cDNAs were PCR-amplified using NcoI forward primer (see above) in combination with BamHI-V5 reverse primer: 5′-ATCTGGATCCCGTAGAATCGAGACCGAGGAG-3′ (V5 constructs), or EcoRI forward primer in combination with NotI reverse primer (see above) and ΔGH mutagenesis reverse primer (see supplementary table) for MYC-tagged point mutants and deletion mutants, respectively. Amplification rates were linear at 25 cycles, as visualized on ethidium bromide-stained 1.2% agarose gels. Real-time PCR was performed in a LightCycler (Roche). Two PCRs were performed with NcoI forward primer and BamHI-V5 reverse primer (see above) amplifying DJ-1, and two PCRs amplifying β-actin as standard (forward primer, 5′-CATGGAGAAAATCTGGCACCACACC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-TGGCCATCTCTTGCTCGAAGTCC-3′) using Fast Mix (Fast Start Taq DNA Polymerase, reaction buffer, MgCl2, SYBR Green I dye, and dNTP mixture). This master mixture was pipetted into a pre-cooled Light Cycler capillary and 50 ng of cDNA or H2O was added. Each capillary was sealed and centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 s, and the following program was started: preincubation, 95 °C for 10 min; amplification, 95 °C for 10 s, 57 °C for 10 s, 72 °C for 15 s (45 cycles); melting curve, denaturation 95 °C for 20°/s, annealing 65 °C for 15 s, melting 95 °C for 0.1°/s continuously; cooling, 40 °C for 30 s. Amplification curves, melting curve, and the Cp temperatures were computed (LightCycler software version 4.0). Pulse-Chase Labeling—HEK293T cells were transiently transfected as above. One day after transfection the cells were starved in methionine/cysteine-free MEM (Sigma) plus 1% l-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin for 1 h. They were then pulsed for 3 h with 75 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine (Promix) (Amersham Biosciences), rinsed, and chased with Dulbecco’s MEM (PAA, Pasching, Austria) plus 1% l-glutamine, 1 mml-methionine, 10% fetal calf serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6) plus Cømplete protease inhibitor mixture, and immunoprecipitation was performed with monoclonal anti-V5 or anti-MYC and protein G-Sepharose (Sigma). After denaturing 15% PAGE, the gels were fixed, soaked in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), and dried. The radiolabeled proteins were visualized on BioMax film (Kodak). For quantification, dried gels with radiolabeled proteins were put on a white screen for 1 day. The screen was then scanned with a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Metabolically labeled full-length DJ-1 bands were quantified in triplicate with the ImageQuant program. Band intensities of the 10-h time points were calculated in percentage to the DJ-1 band intensity protein at 0-h time point. Quantitative pulse-chase experiments were performed covering 10 chase times ranging from 15 s to 24 h, and half-life times were calculated by a non-linear least squares curve fit assuming a first order exponential decay rate (y = e-kt). Proteasome Inhibition—HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with C-terminal tagged mt DJ-1 and cultured for 24 h. Then pulse-chase experiments were performed in the presence of 10 μm MG-132 (Calbiochem), or incubated for up to 24 h with 1 μm epoxomicin (Calbiochem) and steady-state DJ-1 levels at selected time points were determined by Western blotting with 3407 polyclonal to detect DJ-1, mouse monoclonal antibody against β-catenin (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), to measure efficiency of proteasome inhibition, and anti-β-actin (Sigma) to confirm equal loading. Both proteasome inhibitors were delivered in 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide as vehicle. Dimerization of DJ-1—HEK293T cells were transiently cotransfected with point mt DJ-1/V5 constructs and MYC/[wt]DJ-1 using Lipofectamine 2000. After 30 h, cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6) plus Cømplete protease inhibitor mixture, and immunoprecipitation was performed with monoclonal anti-V5 and protein G-Sepharose. After denaturing 15% PAGE and Western transfer, blots were sequentially probed with polyclonal antibodies against MYC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and monoclonal anti-V5. N-terminal MYC-tagged deletion mutants were co-transfected with [wt]DJ-1/V5 in HEK293T cells. After 24 h cell lysates were prepared as above and incubated for 1 h with anti-MYC agarose affinity gel (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were subjected to denaturing 15% PAGE and Western transfer, and blots were probed with 9E10 monoclonal anti-MYC and monoclonal anti-V5. Establishment of DJ-1-deficient MEF Cell Cultures—DJ-1 ko mice were generated using the genetrap approach (described in detail elsewhere). Briefly, genetrap ES cells (clone XE726 from Baygenomics) were generated using the genetrap vector pGT1Lxf. The vector was inserted in the intron between exons 6 and 7. This insertion is predicted to truncate the DJ-1 protein after amino acid residue 136. We verified at the mRNA level the truncation of DJ-1 and showed at the protein level that no [wt]DJ-1 protein was present (data not shown). Cells of the XE726 ES cell clone were of the OLA/SV129 strain and were used to inject into C57BL6/J blastocysts to generate chimeras, which were then mated with C57BL6/J wt mice. The heterozygote offspring was interbred to generate mt mice and wt littermate controls. DJ-1 ko mouse embryos were dissected, heads and red organs were removed and minced in cell culture plates containing Dulbecco’s MEM supplemented with 50% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. As the cultures reached stable growth, serum was gradually reduced to 10%. Then MEFs were immortalized by lipofection with 4 μg of pMSSVLT harboring the SV40 large T antigen (kindly provided by P. Saftig, University of Kiel). After ∼50 passages, immortalized MEFs were used in transient transfection experiments with DJ-1 constructs. Genotyping was performed on genomic DNA extracted with the DNeasy kit (Qiagen). PCR with wt primer forward, 5′-AGGCAGTGGAGAAGTCCATC-3′, and wt primer reverse, 5′-AACATACAGACCCGGGATGA-3′, and mt primer reverse, 5′-CGGTACCAGACTCTCCCATC-3′, amplified 475- and 230-bp products in wt and mt MEFs, respectively. In addition, Southern blot analysis of HindIII-digested genomic DNA generated 8.4- and 16-kb fragments corresponding to wt and mt MEFs, respectively (data not shown). H2O2 Cytotoxicity Assay—Immortalized MEF cell cultures were transfected with DJ-1 expression constructs using Lipo-fectamine 2000. After 24 h, 10,000 cells per well covered with poly-l-lysine (BD Biosciences) were seeded in 96-well plates. After another 24 h, cells were either treated or not with 20 μm H2O2 for 15 h. One-half of the cells were lysed in 9% Triton, the other half was left untreated for 45 min in the incubator. Medium (50 μl) of each well was transferred into a fresh micro-titer plate and 50 μl of CytoTox 96 substrate mixture (Promega) was added. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature in the dark, 50 μl of stop solution was added and absorption at 490 nm measured in a photometer. Cytotoxicity was determined by calculating the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release into the medium divided by maximal LDH release upon cell lysis. Measurement of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)—DJ-1-/- MEF cell cultures were transfected with MYC/DJ-1 expression constructs using Lipofectamine 2000. After 24 h, cells were harvested and seeded (20,000 viable, trypan blue excluding cells per well) into black microtiter plates. Another 24 h later, cells were loaded for 30 min with 100 μm dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands) in Dulbecco’s MEM plus 10% fetal calf serum. After washing, the cells were incubated for 1 h in KRH buffer (118 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES pH 7.4) with or without 200 μm diamide (Fluka, Steinheim, Germany). The amount of dichlorofluorescein generated was determined in a fluorescence plate reader with 485 nm excitation and 525 nm emission wavelengths, respectively. Fluorescence was normalized to the protein content of the well, as determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Assessment of Akt Pathway and ASK1 Activity—MEFs were transiently transfected with MYC/DJ-1 constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 and 48 h later incubated overnight in serum-free Dulbecco’s MEM containing 1% bovine serum albumin. After stimulation with 500 μm H2O2 for 30 min, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (see above) plus 100 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO3, 10 mm Na4P2O7. To determine the oxidation state of PTEN, lysates were reacted with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) for 15 min on ice. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g, and supernatants mixed with nonreducing Laemmli buffer. Forty μg of sample was subjected to denaturing 10% PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-PTEN (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). For determination of Akt phosphorylation, samples were subjected to denaturing 15% PAGE, and Western blots were sequentially probed with phospho-specific anti-[p-T308]Akt, anti-Akt (Cell Signaling), and anti-α-tubulin as loading controls, and 9E10 anti-MYC to measure MYC/DJ-1 expression in parallel. To measure ASK1 activity, immunocomplex kinase assays were performed with the same lysates. Immunoprecipitation was performed with ASK1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with H2O, followed by washing with kinase buffer (Cell Signaling). Beads were resuspended in 27 μl of kinase buffer and 1 μl each of 10 mm ATP, 10 μg/μl myelin basic protein, 10 MBq/μl of [γ-32P]ATP was added. After a 20-min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped with 4× Laemmli buffer. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and loaded on two denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gels. One gel was Coomassie stained, dried, and the radioactive proteins were visualized on BioMax film. The other gel was Western blotted and probed with 3E8 monoclonal DJ-1 antibody (Stressgen, San Diego, CA). For ASK1 co-immunoprecitations, HEK293E cells were transiently co-transfected with constructs encoding ASK1 fused to a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag (kindly provided by H. Ichijo, University of Tokyo, Japan) and MYC/DJ-1. Two days after transfection, cells were lysed in 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 10 mm sodium PPi, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) plus Cømplete protease inhibitor mixture, and immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-HA-agarose (Sigma). Samples were electrophoresed through 4-20% Tris glycine polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Corresponding Western blots were sequentially probed with polyclonal antibodies against ASK1 a"
https://openalex.org/W2041941419,"Sialoadhesin (CD169, siglec-1 or Sn) is an activation marker seen on macrophages in chronic inflammatory diseases and in tumours, and on subsets of tissue macrophages. CD169 is highly expressed by macrophages present in AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma lesions. It is also increased on blood monocytes of HIV-1 infected patients with a high viral load despite antiretroviral treatment.We investigated expression of sialoadhesin in untreated HIV-1 and HHV-8 infected patients, by real-time PCR and FACS analysis to establish its expression in relation to infection and disease progression. Patients analysed were either HIV-1 seroconverters (n = 7), in the chronic phase of HIV-1 infection (n = 21), or in the AIDS stage (n = 58). Controls were HHV-8 infected, but otherwise healthy individuals (n = 20), and uninfected men having sex with men (n = 24). Sialoadhesin mRNA was significantly elevated after HIV-1, but not HHV-8 infection, and a further increase was seen in AIDS patients. Samples obtained around HIV-1 seroconversion indicated that sialoadhesin levels go up early in infection. FACS analysis of PBMCs showed that sialoadhesin protein was expressed at high levels by approximately 90% of CD14(+) and CD14(+)CD16(+)cells of HIV-1(+) patients with a concomitant 10-fold increase in sialoadhesin protein/cell compared with uninfected controls.We have shown that sialoadhesin is induced to high levels on CD14(+) cells early after HIV-1 infection in vivo. The phenotype of the cells is maintained during disease progression, suggesting that it could serve as a marker for infection and probably contributes to the severe dysregulation of the immune system seen in AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W2089341968,"γ-Secretase is an atypical aspartyl protease that cleaves amyloid β-precursor protein to generate Aβ peptides that are causative for Alzheimer disease. γ-Secretase is a multimeric membrane protein complex composed of presenilin (PS), nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2. Pen-2 directly binds to transmembrane domain 4 of PS and confers proteolytic activity on γ-secretase, although the mechanism of activation and its role in catalysis remain unknown. Here we show that an addition of amino acid residues to the N terminus of Pen-2 specifically increases the generation of Aβ42, the longer and more aggregable species of Aβ. The effect of the N-terminal elongation of Pen-2 on Aβ42 generation was independent of the amino acid sequences, the expression system and the presenilin species. In vitro γ-secretase assay revealed that Pen-2 directly affects the Aβ42-generating activity of γ-secretase. The elongation of Pen-2 N terminus caused a reduction in the water accessibility of the luminal side of the catalytic pore of PS1 in a similar manner to that caused by an Aβ42-raising γ-secretase modulator, fenofibrate, as determined by substituted cysteine accessibility method. These data suggest a unique mechanism of Aβ42 overproduction associated with structural changes in the catalytic pore of presenilins caused commonly by the N-terminal elongation of Pen-2 and fenofibrate. γ-Secretase is an atypical aspartyl protease that cleaves amyloid β-precursor protein to generate Aβ peptides that are causative for Alzheimer disease. γ-Secretase is a multimeric membrane protein complex composed of presenilin (PS), nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2.

Iwatsubo T. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2006; 12: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). γ-Secretase cleaves a scissile bond within the transmembrane domain (TMD) of APP and determines the C-terminal length of Aβ. Moreover, more than 50 type I single spanning transmembrane proteins, including Notch protein, are also endoproteolyzed by γ-secretase to secrete short peptides extracellularly, and simultaneously, release intracellular domain into cytosol. A set of intracellular domains mediates the cellular signaling, suggesting that the γ-secretase cleavage has dual roles in membrane protein metabolism: degradation and proteolysis-dependent signaling (2Kopan R. Ilagan M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical studies suggest that γ-secretase is a high molecular weight membrane protein complex, composed of presenilin (PS), nicastrin (Nct), Aph-1, and Pen-2 (1Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2006; 12: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 3Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7931-7939Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Ablation of either of the genes abolished the γ-secretase activity in nematodes, flies, and mice. In contrast, the overexpression of the four proteins reconstituted the proteolytic activity, suggesting that these proteins are necessary and sufficient for the γ-secretase activity (4Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 5Takasugi N. Tomita T. Hayashi I. Tsuruoka M. Niimura M. Takahashi Y.

Chem. 2004; 279: 38040-38046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Molecular cellular and chemical biological analyses revealed that PS forms a hydrophilic pore involving TMD6 and -7 where conserved aspartate residues, that are critical for the γ-secretase activity, reside (7Wolfe M.S.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 12081-12088Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutations in PS genes (PSEN1 and -2) account for the majority of early-onset familial AD (FAD), causing an overproduction of Aβ ending at position 42 (Aβ42), that most readily forms amyloid deposits (1Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2006; 12: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, PS is a catalytic subunit of γ-secretase and regulates the property of endoproteolytic activity. Nct is a single pass transmembrane protein harboring a large extracellular region that captures the N-terminal tip of substrates (9Shah S. Lee S.F. Tabuchi K. Hao Y.H. Yu C. LaPlant Q. Ball H. Dann 3rd, C.E. Sudhof T. Yu G. Cell. 2005; 122: 435-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). This binding is independent of the formation of an active γ-secretase complex, suggesting that Nct functions as a substrate binding site that is distinct from the active site (i.e. exosite) of γ-secretase. Molecular function of Aph-1, a putative multipass membrane protein that forms a subcomplex with Nct in early secretory pathway (10LaVoie M.J. Fraering P.C. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Kimberly W.T. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37213-37222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), remains unknown. However, the loss of Aph-1 or Nct decreased the expression of PS and Pen-2. In contrast, the overexpression of Aph-1 together with Nct stabilizes the γ-secretase complex, suggesting the role of Aph-1 as a molecular scaffold for this atypical membrane-associated protease (5Takasugi N.

Pen-2 is a membrane protein harboring two TMDs with a hairpin-like topology (12Francis R. McGrath G. Zhang J. Ruddy D.A. Sym M. Apfeld J. Nicoll M. Maxwell M. Hai B. Ellis M.C. Parks A.L. Xu W. Li J.

Depletion of Pen-2 caused the loss of the γ-secretase activity accompanied by the accumulation of PS holoprotein-Nct-Aph-1 trimeric complex (5Takasugi N. Tomita T. Hayashi I. Tsuruoka M. Niimura M.

The overexpression of Pen-2 together with PS, Nct, and Aph-1 provoked the endoproteolysis of PS to generate N- and C-terminal fragments (NTF and CTF, respectively), concomitantly with the acquisition of the γ-secretase activity. Mutational analyses revealed that Pen-2 directly binds to TMD4 of PS through its proximal two-thirds of the first TMD (13Kim S.H. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol.

Assembled γ-secretase complex is sorted out from the endoplasmic reticulum and exhibits proteolytic activity. Thus, Pen-2 is the functional activator of the γ-secretase complex in its biosynthetic pathway.

Here we report on an unexpected observation that the length of the N terminus of Pen-2 affects the structure of the active site of γ-secretase in a way to increase Aβ42 generation, in a similar fashion to fenofibrate, an Aβ42-raising γ-secretase modulator.

Simultaneously, synthetic Aβ peptides were loaded and used as molecular standards. N-terminally Tagged Drosophila Pen-2 Specifically Increased Aβ42 Generation—It has been well established that the percentage of secreted Aβ42 that comprises the total secreted Aβ (%Aβ42) is ∼10% in almost all types of mammalian cultured naïve cells (29Asami-Odaka A. Ishibashi Y. Kikuchi T. Kitada C. Suzuki N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10272-10278Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We previously reported that Drosophila S2 cells harbor endogenous γ-secretase activity with a property quite similar to that of mammalian cells, %Aβ42 being at ∼15–20% (5Takasugi N. Tomita T. Hayashi I. Tsuruoka M. Niimura M. Takahashi Y. Thinakaran G. Iwatsubo T. Nature. 2003; 422: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 19Takasugi N. Takahashi Y. Morohashi Y. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50198-50205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the overexpression of Drosophila PS (Psn), nicastrin (dNct), Aph-1 (dAph-1), and Pen-2 (dPen-2) increased the levels of Psn fragments as well as of total γ-secretase activity in Drosophila S2 cells (Fig. 1A) (5Takasugi N. Tomita T. Hayashi I. Tsuruoka M. Niimura M. Takahashi Y. Thinakaran G. Iwatsubo T. Nature. 2003; 422: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). We measured secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42 from cells expressing tagged Drosophila γ-secretase components (i.e. Psn, dNct-V5/His, dAph-1-FLAG, or HA-dPen-2) together with SC100, the latter corresponding to the C-terminal fragment of human APP with a signal peptide. Unexpectedly, S2 cells expressing all the four components secreted significantly increased levels of Aβ42 compared with that from cells expressing Psn, dNct-V5/His, and dAph-1-FLAG (“mock” in Fig. 1B). %Aβ42 was significantly increased to almost 2.5-fold (11.7% in mock, and 28.5% in HA-dPen-2 transfected cells), although the coding sequences of all the γ-secretase components were of wild-type (shown as -fold changes in %Aβ42 compared with mock in Table 1). In contrast, the C-terminal V5/His-tagged dPen-2 had no effect on %Aβ42 (1.2-fold compared with mock, p = 0.339 (n = 3)). To ascertain whether the addition of the tag sequence to the N terminus of dPen-2 caused this effect, we overexpressed dPen-2 without a tag together with Psn, dNct-V5/His, and dAph-1-FLAG and examined the secretion of Aβ. In contrast to HA-dPen-2, %Aβ42 from cells expressing untagged dPen-2 was almost comparable to that in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1B and Table 1). To specifically examine the effects of tagged Pen-2 or other γ-secretase components by eliminating endogenous components, we took a UTR-targeted RNAi/rescue approach on each component (11Niimura M. Isoo N. Takasugi N. Tsuruoka M. Ui-Tei K. Saigo K. Morohashi Y. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12967-12975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which enables us to analyze the function of exogenous proteins under a null-phenotype of the gene of interest in Drosophila S2 cells. The levels of Psn fragments and of the γ-secretase activity were decreased by the UTR-targeted RNAi, suggesting that dsRNAs against the chosen UTR sequences (5′-UTR for Psn and dNct, 3′-UTR for dAph-1 and dPen-2, respectively) did suppress the gene expression. The overexpression of exogenous components (i.e. Psn, dNct-V5/His, dAph-1-FLAG, and HA-dPen-2) in respective knockdown cells restored both the expression of Psn fragment and Aβ generation (Fig. 2, A and B). Intriguingly, however, only Pen-2-rescued cells showed a statistically significant overproduction of Aβ42 (Fig. 2B and Table 2). These data suggest that the reconstitution of the Drosophila γ-secretase complex harboring dPen-2 tagged with HA at the N terminus caused an increase in the Aβ42 generation in Drosophila S2 cells.TABLE 1Relative -fold change in %Aβ42 of S2 cells expressing the tagged dPen-2 together with SC100, Psn, dNct-V5/His, and dAph-1-FLAGView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Only tagged dPen-2 affected the Aβ42 generation in UTR-targeted RNAi and rescue experiment.

To examine if this effect is specific to the HA tag sequence (MYPYDVPDYA), or its length, we constructed dPen-2 tagged at the N terminus with “double” HA (MYPYDVPDYAYPYDVPDYA), Myc (MEQKLISEEDL), FLAG (MDYKDDDDK), or His/Xpress (MPRGSHHHHHHGMASMTGGQQMGRDLYDDDDKDRWGSELE) (HA2-dPen-2, Myc-dPen-2, FLAG-dPen-2, and Hx-dPen2, respectively) and expressed them together with Psn, dNct-V5/His, and dAph-1-FLAG. Immunoblot analysis revealed that all the tagged dPen-2 increased the generation of Psn fragments (Fig. 1A). Moreover, all N-terminally tagged dPen-2 increased %Aβ42 irrespective of the tag sequences, among which HA-dPen-2 and HA2-dPen-2 showed the highest augmentation effect (Fig. 1B and Table 1). The degree of increase in endoproteolysis of Psn was not correlated to that of the Aβ42 overproduction (Fig. 1A). These data strongly suggest that an N-terminal tag of dPen-2, especially the HA sequence, caused an increase in the production of Aβ42. Kim and Sisodia reported, using deletion mutants, that the proximal (residues 3–9 in human PEN-2 (hPEN-2)), but not the distal (residues 10–16), portion of the hydrophilic N-terminal region of hPEN-2 is dispensable for the acquisition of the γ-secretase activity, although the levels of secreted Aβ42 were not documented (13Kim S.H. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1992-2001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To determine whether the HA tag effect on Aβ42 overproduction is dependent on the length and/or integrity of the N terminus of dPen-2, we generated a series of N-terminal length-mutants of dPen-2: dPen-2/Δ2–10 lacking residues 2–10 of dPen-2, HA-dPen-2/Δ2–10, a HA-tagged version of dPen-2/Δ2–10, and dPen-2/10HA11 with a HA tag sequence inserted between residues 10 and 11 (Table 3). Because the HA sequence consists of nine amino acid residues, HA-dPen-2/Δ2–10 and dPen-2/Δ10HA11 have N-terminal amino acid lengths equal to those of untagged dPen-2 and HA-dPen-2, respectively. These mutants increased Psn fragments as well as total Aβ secretion in the presence of Psn, dNct-V5/His, and dAph-1-FLAG (data not shown), suggesting that the proximal region of the N terminus of dPen-2 is dispensable for the γ-secretase activity, in agreement with the result in hPEN-2 (13Kim S.H. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1992-2001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, %Aβ42 in cells expressing dPen-2/Δ2–10 or HA-dPen-2/Δ2–10 was similar to that in cells expressing untagged dPen-2 (Table 3). Thus, the presence of an HA tag sequence at the N terminus of dPen-2 is not sufficient to increase Aβ42 production. In contrast, dPen-2/10HA11 significantly increased %Aβ42 in a similar manner to those with a series of the N-terminally tagged dPen-2 (Table 3). Finally, we examined the effects of untagged or HA-tagged dPen-2/Δ2–17/rep, which harbor several substitutions of amino acid residues (MDISKAPNPRKLELCRK to MELCRGPQPKRVDISKR) within the entire length of the N-terminal region of dPen-2. This mutant carries a totally different amino acid sequence at the N terminus with similar characteristics in terms of bulkiness and charges other than the proline residues. HA-dPen-2/Δ2–17/rep significantly increased the generation of Aβ42, whereas dPen-2/Δ2–17/rep did not affect %Aβ42 at a statistically significant level (Table 3). Collectively, these data strongly suggest that the Aβ42 overproduction closely correlates with the extension of the N-terminal length of dPen-2, regardless of the amino acid sequences of the N-terminal luminal region of dPen-2, as well as of the types of the tag sequence added.TABLE 3Relative -fold change in %Aβ42 of S2 cells expressing mutant dPen-2 together with SC100, Psn, dNct-V5/His, and dAph-1-FLAG*p < 0.05 by Student's t test.**p < 0.005 by Student's t test.

https://openalex.org/W2070065195,"Reelin is an extracellular protein that directs the organization of cortical structures of the brain through the activation of two receptors, the very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and the apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2), and the phosphorylation of Disabled-1 (Dab1). Lis1, the product of the Pafah1b1 gene, is a component of the brain platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 1b (Pafah1b) complex, and binds to phosphorylated Dab1 in response to Reelin. Here we investigated the involvement of the whole Pafah1b complex in Reelin signaling and cortical layer formation and found that catalytic subunits of the Pafah1b complex, Pafah1b2 and Pafah1b3, specifically bind to the NPxYL sequence of VLDLR, but not to ApoER2. Compound Pafah1b1(+/-);Apoer2(-/-) mutant mice exhibit a reeler-like phenotype in the forebrain consisting of the inversion of cortical layers and hippocampal disorganization, whereas double Pafah1b1(+/-);Vldlr(-/-) mutants do not. These results suggest that a cross-talk between the Pafah1b complex and Reelin occurs downstream of the VLDLR receptor."

Since both systems share several components of the intracellular apoptotic cascade and are expressed by first trimester trophoblasts, it is unknown how these cells remain resistant to Fas ligand while sensitive to TNF-α. XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-associated factor 1) is a proapoptotic protein that antagonizes the caspase-inhibitory activity of XIAP. Here, we demonstrated that XAF1 functions as an alternative pathway for TNF-α-induced apoptosis by translocating to the mitochondria and promoting XIAP inactivation. In addition, we showed that the overexpression of XAF1 sensitized first trimester trophoblast cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, we also determined that the differential expression of XAF1 in first and third trimester trophoblast cells was due to changes in XAF1 gene methylation. Our results establish a novel regulatory pathway controlling trophoblast cell survival and provide a molecular mechanism to explain trophoblast sensitivity to TNF-α and the increased number of apoptotic trophoblast cells observed near term.

Despite expressing both Fas and Fas ligand, trophoblast cells isolated from first trimester placentas are resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis under normal conditions (1Payne S.G. Smith S.C. Davidge S.T. Baker P.N. Guilbert L.J. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 2Aschkenazi S. Straszewski S. Verwer K.M. Foellmer H. Rutherford T. Mor G. Biol.

Reprod. 2004; 10: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to Fas ligand-induced apoptosis, first trimester trophoblast cells have been shown to be sensitive to TNF-α-mediated apoptosis (1Payne S.G. Smith S.C. Davidge S.T. Baker P.N. Guilbert L.J. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 2Aschkenazi S. Straszewski S. Verwer K.M. Foellmer H. Rutherford T. Mor G. Biol.

Since both Fas and TNF-R1, the death receptor that mediates TNF-α-induced apoptosis (6Yui J. Hemmings D. Garcia-Lloret M. Guilbert L.J. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 400-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 7Rasmussen C.A. Pace J.L. Banerjee S. Phillips T.A. Hunt J.S. Placenta. 1999; 20: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), share several components of the intracellular apoptotic cascade, it is unknown how first trimester trophoblast cells remain resistant to Fas but sensitive to TNF-α-induced apoptosis. The central executioners of apoptosis are the caspases, a family of cysteine proteases that are subdivided into two groups. Whereas the initiator caspases initiate apoptosis by activating the downstream effector or executioner caspases, the effector caspases cleave numerous vital cellular proteins in order to affect the apoptotic cascade (8Fischer U. Janicke R.U. Schulze-Osthoff K. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 76-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Activation of the caspase cascade is tightly regulated by several endogenous intracellular inhibitors, which prevent further propagation of the death signal either at the “initiator” or “effector” level. Inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) are unique in that they are capable of inhibiting both initiator and effector caspases. To date, eight human IAPs have been identified, but X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) is the most potent and versatile member of the family (9Liston P. Fong W.G. Kelly N.L. Toji S. Miyazaki T. Conte D. Tamai K. Craig C.G. McBurney M.W. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). XIAP contains three tandem BIR domains and a C-terminal RING domain, which are known to differentially inhibit initiator and effector caspases (10Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). The BIR2 domain together with the linker region between the BIR1 and BIR2 domains of XIAP have been shown to inhibit the activation of “effector” caspase-3 and caspase-7 (11Takahashi R. Deveraux Q. Tamm I. Welsh K. Assa-Munt N. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7787-7790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), whereas the inhibitory activity of “initiator” caspase-9 was localized to the BIR3-RING domain of XIAP (12Sun C. Cai M. Meadows R.P. Xu N. Gunasekera A.H. Herrmann J. Wu J.C. Fesik S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33777-33781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Upon certain apoptotic stimuli, caspases can cleave XIAP into two distinct fragments, an N-terminal fragment containing BIR1-2 and a second fragment containing BIR3-RING (13Deveraux Q.L. Leo E. Stennicke H.R. Welsh K. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5242-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 14Johnson D.E. Gastman B.R. Wieckowski E. Wang G.Q. Amoscato A. Delach S.M. Rabinowich H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1818-1823PubMed Google Scholar). The BIR1-2 fragment has diminished ability to inhibit caspase-3 and is not easily detected, since it is susceptible to further caspase-mediated degradation. In contrast, the BIR3-RING fragment is more stable and retains the ability to inhibit caspase-9 but is unable to suppress Fas-induced apoptosis (13Deveraux Q.L. Leo E. Stennicke H.R. Welsh K. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5242-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this XIAP cleavage product may represent a dominant negative form of XIAP, which interferes with the function of the active, full-length form of XIAP by promoting caspase activation (14Johnson D.E. Gastman B.R. Wieckowski E. Wang G.Q. Amoscato A. Delach S.M. Rabinowich H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1818-1823PubMed Google Scholar). Our laboratory and others previously demonstrated that the full-length form of XIAP is highly expressed in trophoblast cells of first trimester placentas (3Straszewski-Chavez S.L. Abrahams V.M. Funai E.F. Mor G. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2004; 10: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 15Gruslin A. Qiu Q. Tsang B.K. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1264-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and that it protects first trimester trophoblast cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis (3Straszewski-Chavez S.L. Abrahams V.M. Funai E.F. Mor G. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2004; 10: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that the expression of the fulllength form of XIAP significantly decreases in the trophoblast layer of third trimester placentas (15Gruslin A. Qiu Q. Tsang B.K. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1264-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), correlating with the concomitant increase in placental apoptosis (16Smith S.C. Baker P.N. Symonds E.M. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1997; 177: 57-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 17Smith S.C. Leung T.N. To K.F. Baker P.N. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 2000; 183: 697-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, we demonstrated that the XIAP BIR3-RING cleavage fragment is primarily expressed in third trimester placentas and in isolated first trimester trophoblast cells undergoing apoptosis and that its appearance correlated with an increase in caspase-9 and caspase-3 activity (3Straszewski-Chavez S.L. Abrahams V.M. Funai E.F. Mor G. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2004; 10: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). How the anti-caspase activity of XIAP is regulated in first trimester trophoblast cells and the factor(s) that can overcome the expression of XIAP and allow first trimester trophoblast cell apoptosis to occur are unknown. The inhibition of XIAP and other IAP family members is mediated by a group of proteins that includes Smac/DIABLO (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase/direct IAPbinding protein with low propidium iodide), OMI/HtrA2 (high temperature requirement protein A2), and XAF1 (XIAP-associated factor 1). Although XAF1 is thought to be a proapoptotic nuclear protein (18Fong W.G. Liston P. Rajcan-Separovic E. St. Jean M. Craig C. Korneluk R.G. Genomics. 2000; 70: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), Smac/DIABLO and OMI/HtrA2 have been shown to be mitochondria-associated proteins that are released from mitochondria upon certain apoptotic stimuli to inhibit XIAP function (19Suzuki Y. Imai Y. Nakayama H. Takahashi K. Takio K. Takahashi R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 613-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 20Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar, 21Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2870) Google Scholar), albeit by different mechanisms. Both Smac/DIABLO and OMI/HtrA2 bind to the BIR domains within XIAP, thereby displacing caspase-9 and caspase-3 and allowing caspase activation. However, OMI/HtrA2 is also a serine protease that has been shown to cleave XIAP, rendering it inactive (22Yang Q.H. Church-Hajduk R. Ren J. Newton M.L. Du C. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1487-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 23Srinivasula S.M. Gupta S. Datta P. Zhang Z. Hegde R. Cheong N. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31469-31472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). XAF1 was identified based on its ability to bind to XIAP and was proposed to cause the redistribution of XIAP from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, thereby inhibiting the anticaspase activity of XIAP (9Liston P. Fong W.G. Kelly N.L. Toji S. Miyazaki T. Conte D. Tamai K. Craig C.G. McBurney M.W. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Indeed, a subsequent study demonstrated that endogenous XAF1 localized to both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of interferon-β-treated cells; however, no nuclear relocation of XIAP was observed in XAF1-expressing cells in response to interferon-β treatment (24Leaman D.W. Chawla-Sarkar M. Vyas K. Reheman M. Tamai K. Toji S. Borden E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28504-28511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Therefore, additional studies are required to elucidate the mechanism by which XAF1 inhibits the function of XIAP. Interestingly, the XAF1 gene was previously localized to chromosome 17p13.2 (18Fong W.G. Liston P. Rajcan-Separovic E. St. Jean M. Craig C. Korneluk R.G. Genomics. 2000; 70: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and our laboratory recently demonstrated that this region of chromosome 17 confers sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis (25Lareef M.H. Tahin Q. Song J. Russo I.H. Mihaila D. Slater C.M. Balsara B. Testa J.R. Broccoli D. Grobelny J.V. Mor G. Cuthbert A. Russo J. Mol. Carcinog. 2004; 39: 234-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Since XAF1 antagonizes XIAP function (9Liston P. Fong W.G. Kelly N.L. Toji S. Miyazaki T. Conte D. Tamai K. Craig C.G. McBurney M.W. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) and the inhibition of XIAP renders first trimester trophoblast cells sensitive to Fas-induced apoptosis, we hypothesized that XAF1 plays a role in sensitizing trophoblast cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize XAF1 expression and function in trophoblast cells. We describe a novel role for XAF1 in TNF-α-induced apoptosis and how XAF1 expression is temporally regulated throughout normal pregnancy. Reagents and Antibodies—The agonistic anti-human Fas monoclonal antibody (mAb) (clone E0S9.1) was obtained from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA), and the recombinant human TNF-α was from PeproTech, Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). The pancaspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone, was purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN), and actinomycin D was from Sigma. The NF-κB inhibitor, SN50, was obtained from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA), and the OMI/HtrA2 protease inhibitor, ucf-101, was from Calbiochem. The mouse anti-XAF1 mAb (1:200) has been described previously (9Liston P. Fong W.G. Kelly N.L. Toji S. Miyazaki T. Conte D. Tamai K. Craig C.G. McBurney M.W. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), and the rabbit anti-XAF1 polyclonal antibody (IMG-379; 1:100) was purchased from Imgenex (San Diego, CA). Both the mouse anti-XIAP mAb (clone 28; 1:1000) and the mouse anti-Bax mAb (clone 3; 1:500) were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). The mouse anti-caspase-9 mAb (clone LAP6; 1:2000) was purchased from R&D Systems, the rabbit anti-caspase-3 polyclonal antibody (catalog number 9661; 1:5000) was from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA), and the rabbit anti-cytochrome c polyclonal antibody (catalog number S2050; 1:10,000) was from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). The mouse anti-NF-κB p65 mAb (clone F-6; 1:2000) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and the rabbit polyclonal antibody for β-actin (A2066; 1:10,000) was purchased from Sigma. Primary antibody signals were detected using either a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated horse anti-mouse, or a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:10,000) from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Placental Tissue—Term placentas (38-40 weeks gestational age) were obtained from clinically normal pregnancies following vaginal delivery. First trimester placentas (7-12 weeks gestational age) were obtained from normal pregnancies, voluntarily terminated for reasons unrelated to the present study. A signed, written consent form was obtained from each patient. The use of placental tissue specimens and consent forms was approved by the Yale University Human Investigation Committee. Tissue specimens were collected in cold, sterile phosphate-buffered saline and immediately transported to the laboratory for cell culture preparation. First Trimester Primary Trophoblast Cell Isolation and Culture—Primary trophoblast cells were isolated from first trimester placentas as previously described (2Aschkenazi S. Straszewski S. Verwer K.M. Foellmer H. Rutherford T. Mor G. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 66: 1853-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 3Straszewski-Chavez S.L. Abrahams V.M. Funai E.F. Mor G. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2004; 10: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Isolated first trimester trophoblast cells were cultured at 37 °C/5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% human serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, CA). Cell Lines—The first trimester human trophoblast cell line, 3A, has been previously described (2Aschkenazi S. Straszewski S. Verwer K.M. Foellmer H. Rutherford T. Mor G. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 66: 1853-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 3Straszewski-Chavez S.L. Abrahams V.M. Funai E.F. Mor G. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2004; 10: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), whereas the TPA third trimester trophoblast cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Both cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, South Logan, UT), 10 mm Hepes, 0.1 mm minimal essential medium nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and maintained at 37 °C/5% CO2. Plasmid Constructs—The HA-tagged XAF1 open reading frame and 3′-untranslated region were subcloned from the pACT vector into EcoRI sites of the pCI-neo vector (Promega, Madison, WI) as previously described (9Liston P. Fong W.G. Kelly N.L. Toji S. Miyazaki T. Conte D. Tamai K. Craig C.G. McBurney M.W. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The XAF1-15L-HaloTag fusion cassette was constructed by replacing the p65-coding region in a vector encoding p65-15L-pHT2 (Promega) described previously (57Schmid J.A. Birbach A. Hofer-Warbinek R. Pengg M. Burner U. Furtmuller P.G. Binder B.R. de Martin R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17035-17042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) with the XAF1 coding region. XAF1 was amplified using the primers 5′-CTGACATCCACTTTGCCTTTCTCT-3′ and 5′-GTAGTACCACGCGTGACTAGTGGATC-3′ and inserted into NheI and MluI sites of the p65-15L-pHT2 vector. The sequence of the XAF1-15L-HaloTag fusion construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Transfection—Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions using 2 μg of plasmid DNA at a transfection reagent/plasmid DNA ratio of 3:1. Transient transfections were performed overnight (16-24 h) at 37 °C/5% CO2, and cells were allowed to recover in medium with 10% fetal bovine serum for 0-48 h. pCI-neo-XAF1 stable transfectants were selected for with the G418 antibiotic. HaloTag Labeling System—Cells transiently expressing XAF1-HaloTag were labeled with 5 mm HaloTag tetramethyl rhodamine (TMR) ligand for 15 min according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Unbound ligand was removed by washing the cells twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Fluorescence intensities in cell lysates were measured at 535 and 600 nm using an automatic microplate reader (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). The expression of the fusion protein was determined by SDS-PAGE on a fluorescence imager (Typhoon 9400; Amersham Biosciences) and by Western blot analysis with an anti-XAF1 antibody. Live cells were visualized with a FV500 confocal microscope (Olympus) using a 545-nm green HeNe laser (6.0% transmittance, PMT gain = 600) and a TRITC filter set. Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Cell Fractionation—Cells were separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions by centrifugation using the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents kit (catalog number 78833; Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and 100-200 μl of ice-cold CER I buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) was added to the cellular pellet based on the amount of packed cell volume, vortexed, and incubated on ice for 10 min. 5.5-11 μl of ice-cold CER II was added to the tube to isolate the cytoplasmic extract, vortexed, and incubated on ice for 1 min. Following centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant containing the cytoplasmic extract was collected, and the remaining insoluble pellet, which contains the nuclei, was resuspended in 50-100 μl of ice-cold NER buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and the protease inhibitor mixture. The tube was vortexed and incubated on ice for 10 min four times for a total of 40 min. Following centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatant containing the nuclear extract was collected. All extracts were stored at -80 °C until use. To ensure the integrity of the preparations, the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were analyzed for the expression of DNA topoisomerase I, a nucleus-specific protein. Mitochondrial and Cytoplasmic Cell Fractionation—Mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractionation was performed by centrifugation using the ApoAlert cell fractionation kit (catalog number 630105; BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold wash buffer, and centrifuged at 2,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Once the supernatant was removed, the cells were resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold fractionation buffer mix containing protease inhibitor mixture and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The tube was incubated on ice for 10 min, and the cells were passed through a 21-gauge 1½-needle syringe 25 times to homogenize the sample. The homogenate was transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 2,750 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 25 min at 4 °C to separate the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions. The supernatant containing the cytoplasmic extract was transferred to a new tube, whereas the remaining pellet, which is the mitochondrial fraction, was resuspended in 200 μl of the fractionation buffer mix. All extracts were stored at -80 °C until use. The expression of COX4, which is a mitochondria-specific protein that is retained on the inner mitochondrial membrane even in cells undergoing apoptosis, was analyzed in the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractions to ensure the integrity of the preparations. Immunohistochemistry—First and third trimester placental samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and paraffin-embedded as previously described (26Mor G. Gutierrez L.S. Eliza M. Kahyaoglu F. Arici A. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1998; 40: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Sections of placenta (5 μm) were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and masked with target retrieval solution (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) in a steamer at 95 °C for 30 min. XAF1 expression was evaluated using the rabbit anti-XAF1 polyclonal antibody (1:100). The slides were mounted with permanent aqueous mounting medium (ScyTek, Logan, UT) and visualized by light microscopy. Cell Viability Assay—Cell viability was evaluated using the CellTiter 96 assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 5 × 103 cells were plated in triplicate wells of a 96-well microtiter plate (BD Biosciences) in a 100-ml volume per well. Following treatment, 20 ml of the CellTiter substrate, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) was added to each well, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 1-4 h. Optical densities of the samples were measured at 490 nm using an automatic microplate reader (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). The values of the treated cells were compared with the values generated from the untreated control and reported as percentage viability. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting Analysis—Cells (2 × 106) were detached with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) and centrifuged as previously described (3Straszewski-Chavez S.L. Abrahams V.M. Funai E.F. Mor G. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2004; 10: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The pelleted cells were washed twice with 5 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline. After the final centrifugation, the cellular pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated on ice with 5 mg/ml Hoechst 33342 dye (Molecular Probes) and 1 mg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) for 15 min. Hoechst 33342 dye stains the condensed chromatin of apoptotic cells more brightly than the chromatin of normal cells, whereas propidium iodide is only permeant to dead cells. The staining pattern that results from the simultaneous use of both of these dyes makes it possible to distinguish between apoptotic and dead cells by flow cytometry. Unstained cells served as a measure of background fluorescence. The samples were analyzed using a Vantage fluorescence-activated cell sorter (BD Biosciences) with 488 nm/UV dual excitation. Propidium iodide staining was detected in the FL-2 channel, and Hoechst staining was detected in the SSc-W channel. Data were analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed using 5 μg of total RNA and the First Strand cDNA synthesis kit from Amersham Biosciences. Half of the reverse transcription reaction was amplified using the XAF1-specific primers 5′-GAGCACCAGCAGGTTGGGTG-3′ and 5′-AATCATTTGGTTGCAATAAT-3′ as previously described (24Leaman D.W. Chawla-Sarkar M. Vyas K. Reheman M. Tamai K. Toji S. Borden E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28504-28511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Thirty cycles of PCR were performed at 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Western Blot Analysis—The cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1% SDS in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). 20 μg of total cellular protein was loaded per lane and separated under reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE as previously described (3Straszewski-Chavez S.L. Abrahams V.M. Funai E.F. Mor G. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2004; 10: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Caspase Activity Assay—Caspase activity was measured using the Caspase Glo assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 10 μg of total cellular protein from cell lysates was added to the proluminescent LEHD (caspase-9) or DEVD (caspase-3) substrate at a 1:1 ratio in a 100-ml volume and incubated at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. Following incubation, luminescence was measured using a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). All samples were assayed in triplicate. Luminescence was expressed as relative light units (RLU) and is proportional to the amount of caspase activity present in the sample. XAF1 Promoter Methylation—The methylation status of the XAF1 promoter was assessed by bisulfite sequencing. This procedure takes advantage of DNA sequence differences between methylated and unmethylated alleles after bisulfite DNA modification, which deaminates unmethylated cytosine, converting it to uracil, but spares methylated cytosine (27Frommer M.

Progesterone triggers meiotic resumption also called the G2/M transition. This event is characterized by germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and by a burst in phosphorylation level that reflects activation of M-phase-promoting factor (MPF) and MAPK pathways. Besides phosphorylation and ubiquitin pathways, increasing evidence has suggested that the cytosolic and nucleus-specific O-GlcNAc glycosylation also contributes to cell cycle regulation. To investigate the relationship between O-GlcNAc and cell cycle, Xenopus oocyte, in which most of the M-phase regulators have been discovered, was used. Alloxan, an O-GlcNAc transferase inhibitor, blocked G2/M transition in a concentration-dependent manner. Alloxan prevented GVBD and both MPF and MAPK activations, either triggered by progesterone or by egg cytoplasm injection. The addition of detoxifying enzymes (SOD and catalase) did not rescue GVBD, indicating that the alloxan effect did not occur through reactive oxygen species production. These results were strengthened by the use of a benzoxazolinone derivative (XI), a new O-GlcNAc transferase inhibitor. Conversely, injection of O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate, an O-GlcNAcase inhibitor, accelerated the maturation process. Glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase inhibitors, azaserine and 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine, failed to prevent GVBD. Such a strategy appeared to be inefficient; indeed, UDP-GlcNAc assays in mature and immature oocytes revealed a constant pool of the nucleotide sugar. Finally, we observed that cyclin B2, the MPF regulatory subunit, was associated with an unknown O-GlcNAc partner.

Immature vertebrates oocytes, arrested at prophase I of meiosis, can resume their cell cycle, also called maturation, in response to hormonal stimulation (1Masui Y. J. Exp. Zool. 1967; 166: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 2Smith L.D. Ecker R.E. Subtelny S. Dev. Biol. 1968; 17: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Studies in amphibian Xenopus laevis oocyte have greatly contributed to the knowledge of the biochemical activities of the key regulatory molecules involved in these processes (3Schmitt A. Nebreda A.R. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2457-2459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Meiosis entry, analogous to G2/M transition, is promoted by a cytoplasmic factor called MPF. 3The abbreviations used are: MPF, M-phase-promoting factor; O-GlcNAc, O-linked N-acetylglucosamine; PTM, post-translational modification; DON, 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine; GFAT, glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase; GVBD, germinal vesicle breakdown; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; OGT, O-linked N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase; O-GlcNAcase, O-linked N-acetylglucosaminidase; PUGNAc, O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD, superoxide dismutase; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; ALX, alloxan. MPF, made up of a catalytic subunit, Cdk1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1) (also called Cdc2 (cell division cycle 2)), and a regulatory subunit, cyclin B, has been demonstrated to be the universal regulator of mitosis and meiosis entry. Activation of this cyclin-Cdk complex is controlled by phosphorylation and proteolysis (for reviews, see Refs. 4Nurse P. Masui Y. Hartwell L. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1103-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar and 5Masui Y. Differentiation. 2001; 69: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Association between the regulatory subunit and Cdk1 requires phosphorylation of Cdk1 on residue Thr161 by Cdk-activating kinase (6Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1991; 64: 903-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Then, to be catalytically active, Cdk1 is dephosphorylated on Thr14 and Tyr15 residues by Cdc25, a dual specific phosphatase (6Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1991; 64: 903-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 7Lorca T. Labbe J.C. Devault A. Fesquet D. Capony J.P. Cavadore J.C. Le Bouffant F. Doree M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2381-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Simultaneously to Cdk1 dephosphorylation, cyclin B is phosphorylated (8Gautier J. Maller J.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Xenopus immature oocytes, which are synchronized at the diplotene stage of first meiosis, contain large amounts of inactive MPF, or pre-MPF (4Nurse P. Masui Y. Hartwell L. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1103-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 5Masui Y. Differentiation. 2001; 69: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Inhibition of pre-MPF is provided by Myt1 that phosphorylates Cdk1 on Thr14 and Tyr15 and then inactivates the complex. Pre-MPF can be directly activated by Cdc25 injection (9Rime H. Huchon D. De Smedt V. Thibier C Galaktionov K. Jessus C. Ozon R. Biol. Cell. 1994; 82: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or through an autoamplification loop. The latter loop involves the ability of MPF to phosphorylate and activate Cdc25 (10Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 11Strausfeld U. Fernandez A. Capony J.P. Girard F. Lautredou N. Derancourt J. Labbe J.C. Lamb N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5989-6000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and does not depend upon protein synthesis (12Wasserman W.J. Masui Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1975; 91: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Simultaneously to MPF activation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-like Xp42mpk1 is phosphorylated and activated (13Ferrell Jr., J.E. Wu M. Gerhart J.C. Martin G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1965-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Xp42mpk1 belongs to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway that is turned on by Mos oncoprotein synthesis in response to progesterone stimulation (14Sagata M. Oskarsson M. Copeland T. Brumbaugh J. Vande Woude G.F. Nature. 1988; 335: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Once activated, Xp42mpk1 phosphorylates and activates ribosomal S6 kinase (p90rsk), which negatively regulates Myt1 (15Palmer A. Gavin A.C. Nebreda A.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5037-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Activation of the Mos-Xp42mpk1 pathway has been shown not to be required for MPF activation but for timely M-phase entry when oocytes are stimulated either by progesterone or insulin (16Fischer D.L. Brassac T. Galas S. Doree M. Development. 1999; 126: 4537-4546PubMed Google Scholar, 17Dupre A. Suziedelis K. Valuckaite R. de Gunzburg J. Ozon R. Jessus C. Haccart O.

Nevertheless, this pathway has been shown to be responsible for S-Phase suppression between meiosis I and meiosis II, for metaphase II arrest, and for spindle morphogenesis (17Dupre A. Suziedelis K.

Biol. 2005; 283: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Mitogenic signals orchestrate a regulatory network of proteins mainly through post-translational modifications (PTMs). Although phosphorylation is the molecular mechanism associated with the regulation of cell cycle, it is clearly not the only post-translational mechanism involved in cell cycle progression. Recent observations have suggested that the cytosolic and nucleus-specific O-linked N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAc) could be involved in cell cycle progression (22Lefebvre T. Baert F. Bodart J.F. Flament S. Michalski J.C. Vilain J.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 999-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Slawson C. Housley M.P. Hart G.W. J. Cell.

Chem. 2005; 280: 32944-32956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). O-GlcNAc is a highly dynamic PTM whose versatility is regulated by two enzymes (25Iyer S.P. Hart G.W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2493-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar): the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) that catalyzes the transfer of the GlcNAc moiety from UDP-GlcNAc and O-GlcNAcase that hydrolyzes the GlcNAc residue. Although the functions played by this single PTM remain to be determined, several studies tend to demonstrate that O-GlcNAc is tightly linked to cell cycle regulation. Microinjection of bovine galactosyltransferase inhibited Xenopus oocytes M-phase entry and blocked S- to M-phase transition (26Fang B. Miller M.W. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 263: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Slawson et al. (27Slawson C. Shafii S. Amburgey J. Potter R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) showed that perturbation of Xenopus oocyte O-GlcNAc levels, either by glucosamine or O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc) treatments, modified maturation kinetics. We previously reported that the G2- to M-phase transition was accompanied with a noticeable increase in O-GlcNAc glycosylation (22Lefebvre T. Baert F. Bodart J.F. Flament S. Michalski J.C. Vilain J.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 999-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Last, PUGNAc was used to inhibit O-GlcNAcase on somatic cultured cells; such treated cells progressed through the cell cycle more slowly than untreated cells (24Slawson C. Zachara N.E. Vosseler K. Cheung W.D. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32944-32956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This delay was more pronounced during the S-phase progression and at the G2/M boundary. By contrast, inhibition of glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT) with 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine (DON), resulting in low O-GlcNAc level, shortened S-phase, and G2/M progression. In return, GFAT inhibition delayed G1 progression in comparison with controls or PUGNAc-treated cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that O-GlcNAc dynamic is a key regulatory PTM in cell cycle progression. The present study pointed out a role for O-GlcNAc glycosylation as a key regulator mechanism for progression from G2 arrest to M-phase in Xenopus oocyte, through the regulation of both MPF and MAPK pathways. Animals, Chemicals, and Bioreagents—Adult Xenopus females come from the University of Rennes I (France). Tricaine methane sulfonate was purchased from Sandoz (Levallois-Perret, France). Collagenase A was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Progesterone, picroindigocarmine, alloxan, uracil, azaserine, DON, catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), WGA-agarose beads, monoclonal anti-p34cdc2 antibody, and Dowex 50WX2-400 were purchased from Sigma. PUGNAc was a kind gift from Prof. Jérôme Lemoine (UMR/CNRS 5579, Villeurbanne, France). Benzoxazolinone derivative (XI) was synthesized in Suzanne Walker's laboratory (28Gross B.J. Kraybill B.C. Walker S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 14588-14589Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-O-GlcNAc (RL-2) was purchased from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO); polyclonal anti-β-catenin (H-102), monoclonal anti-Erk2 (D-2), and rabbit polyclonal anti-p90rsk (C21) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); monoclonal anti-Hsp/Hsc70 (SPA-820) was from Stressgen (Victoria, Canada); rabbit anti-phospho-Tyr15-Cdc2 and anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA); and rabbit polyclonal anti-cyclin B2 (JG103) was a gift from Dr. J. Gannon (ICRF, South Mimms, UK). Anti-mouse, anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence were purchased from GE Healthcare (Saclay, France). Handling of Oocytes—After anesthetizing Xenopus females by immersion in 1 g/liter MS222 solution (tricaine methane sulfonate), ovarian lobes were surgically removed and placed in ND96 medium (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5). Fully grown stage VI oocytes were isolated, and follicle cells were partially removed by 1 mg/ml collagenase A treatment for 30 min followed by a manual microdissection. Oocytes were stored at 14 °C in ND96 medium until experiments. Stimulation and Analysis of G2/M Transition (Meiotic Resumption) in Xenopus Oocytes—Meiotic resumption was induced by incubating oocytes in ND96 medium containing 10 μm progesterone or by cytoplasm microinjection. Briefly, cytoplasm of matured oocytes was collected and microinjected in immature oocytes (50 nl/oocyte) using a positive displacement digital micropipette (Nichiryo, Tokyo, Japan). GVBD was scored by the appearance of a white spot at the animal pole of the oocyte and confirmed by hemisection of oocyte after heat fixation (100 °C, 5 min). Alternatively, oocytes were fixed overnight in Smith's fixative, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin for cytological studies. 7-μm sections were stained with nuclear red for the detection of nuclei and chromosomes, whereas picroindigocarmine was used to reveal cytoplasmic structures (21Bodart J.F. Baert F.Y. Sellier C. Duesbery N.S. Flament S. Vilain J.P. Dev. Biol. 2005; 283: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Oocyte Treatments—Before stimulation of meiotic resumption, oocytes (15–20 oocytes/condition) were incubated overnight with alloxan concentrations ranging from 1 to 5 mm, 5 mm uracil, 500 μm Me2SO-solubilized benzoxazolinone derivative, 40–80 units of catalase, 150 units of SOD, or 0.1–5 mm hydrogen peroxide. For GFAT inhibition experiments, 100 μm DON or 20 μm azaserine were directly injected into oocytes before progesterone treatment. For O-GlcNAcase inhibition, PUGNAc (concentrations ranging from 100 to 400 μm) was also microinjected in immature oocytes before meiotic resumption stimulation. 5–10 oocytes were taken at the end of the experiment respecting the white spot ratio, and stored at –20 °C until further biochemical analysis. Enrichment of O-GlcNAc-bearing Proteins with WGA Immobilized on Agarose Beads—These experiments were performed in two conditions as previously described (29Zhu W. Leber B. Andrews D.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5999-6007Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar): in smooth conditions, which allows the recovery of all O-GlcNAc-modified proteins and their associated partners, and in more stringent conditions in which all protein-to-protein interactions are broken. WGA Enrichment in Smooth Conditions—Batches of 20 immature or matured oocytes were taken and lysed in 200 μl of homogenization buffer (60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 15 mm paranitrophenylphosphate, 25 mm MOPS, 15 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors, pH 7.2). After centrifugation at 20,000 × g, supernatants were collected and diluted with phosphate-buffered saline. Samples were then incubated for 90 min at 4 °C with 50 μl of WGA-agarose beads. Proteins bound to WGA-beads were collected by centrifugation, washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli buffer, and boiled for 10 min. WGA Enrichment in Stringent Conditions—Briefly, batches of 20 immature or mature oocytes were lysed in 200 μl of homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors). After centrifugation at 20,000 × g, supernatants were collected, and 800 μl of homogenization buffer was added. Then samples were incubated with WGA-agarose beads, and WGA-bound proteins were collected, washed four times in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.4% sodium deoxycholate, 0.3% SDS, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and resuspended in Laemmli buffer. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Proteins (the equivalent of one oocyte was loaded per lane) were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE for O-GlcNAc, phospho-p42/44 MAPK, Hsp/Hsc70, and β-catenin immunodetection. 17.5% modified SDS-PAGE (18Baert F.

Tardivel A. Boujard D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 188: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was also run for phospho-Tyr15-Cdc2, Erk2, cyclin B2, and p90rsk immunodetection, since it allows a better discrimination between active and inactive forms of these proteins, and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose sheet. Although the quantity of proteins remains rather constant in Xenopus oocyte, equal loading and transfer efficiency were checked using Ponceau red staining. Blots were saturated in 5% (w/v) milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween (15 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween) for 45 min. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Mouse monoclonal anti-O-GlcNAc (RL-2), mouse monoclonal anti-Erk2 (D-2), mouse monoclonal anti-Hsc/Hsp70 (SPA-820), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-p42/44 MAPK, rabbit polyclonal anti-β-catenin (H102), rabbit polyclonal anti-cyclin B2, and rabbit polyclonal anti-p90rsk were used at a dilution of 1:1,000. Rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Tyr15-Cdc2 antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:750. Then nitrocellulose membranes were washed three times for 10 min in Tris-buffered saline-Tween and incubated with either an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody or an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:10,000 for β-catenin, Erk2, and phospho-p42/44 MAPK detection, at a dilution of 1:5,000 for cyclin B2, p90rsk, and phospho-Tyr15-Cdc2 detection. Finally, three washes of 10 min each were performed with Tris-buffered saline-Tween, and the detection was carried out with enhanced chemiluminescence. Measurement of UDP-GlcNAc Pools by High Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography—Ten oocytes were lysed in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, 10 mm NaCl, 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm MgCl2, and proteases inhibitors, pH 7.2). 50 μl of 1 m HCl were then added to the lysate, and the mixture was passed through a 1.5-ml Dowex 50WX2-400 column. The column was washed with 10 ml of bipermuted water. The unbound fraction and washes were collected on ice and adjusted to pH 8.0 with 500 μl of 1 m Tris/HCl. 250 μl of the diluted fraction was injected using a ProPAC-PA1 column (4 × 250 mm) on a Dionex (Jouy en Josas, France) high performance liquid chromatography system. The elution was achieved as follows: Tris/HCl (20 mm, pH 9.2) (solution A) for 1 min; elution gradient for 29 min with 85% A and 15% NaCl at 2 m (solution B); plateau of 5 min in the same conditions; 10-min elution gradient until 100% B was reached; plateau at 100% B for 5 min. The column was then re-equilibrated in 100% A. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. Detection was performed using a Spectroflow 757 UV spectrophotometer (Kratos-Analytical, Shimadzu, Champs sur Marne, France) at a wavelength of 256 nm. The OGT Inhibitor Alloxan Blocks O-GlcNAc Increase and Progesterone-induced G2/M Transition—In a previous report, we demonstrated that Xenopus oocyte meiotic resumption was accompanied with a burst in O-GlcNAc content (22Lefebvre T. Baert F. Bodart J.F. Flament S. Michalski J.C. Vilain J.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 999-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In order to understand the biological significance of this glycosylation increase, we inhibited OGT using the uracil analogue alloxan (ALX) (31Konrad R.J. Zhang F. Hale J.E. Knierman M.D. Becker G.W. Kudlow J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Recently, alloxan has been successfully used for its OGT-inhibitory effect, in isolated neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes (32Kim Y.H. Song M. O. H. Y. S. Heo K. Choi J.W. Park J.M. Kim S.H. Lim S. Kwon H.M. Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 207: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), in intact rat heart (33Champattanachai V. Marchase R.B. Chatham J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C178-C187Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and in C2C12 myoblasts (34Liu J. Pang. Y. Chang T. Bounelis P. Chatham J.C. Marchase R.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2006; 40: 303-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Oocytes were incubated with progesterone to trigger G2/M transition, together with increasing amounts of alloxan, and a dose-dependent inhibition of GVBD was observed (Fig. 1A). Used as a negative control, uracil had no effect on meiosis resumption induced by hormonal stimulation (third lane). A significant inhibitory effect of alloxan was observed for concentrations ranging from 3 to 5 mm, whereas lower doses (1 and 2 mm) had no or little effect on G2/M transition. Prevention of M-phase by alloxan appeared to be correlated with an O-GlcNAc level reduction: O-GlcNAc progressively decreased from 3 to 5 mm alloxan-treated oocytes to finally reach an O-GlcNAc pattern similar to that of immature oocytes (G2-phase). At the biochemical level, oocytes treated with these alloxan concentrations did not exhibit the typical pattern of M-phase-entered oocytes (Fig. 1B, lanes 6–8). Rsk, whose phosphorylation directly depends upon MAPK activity, remained unphosphorylated, in contrast to phosphorylated forms that shift in electrophoretic mobility in metaphase II-arrested control oocytes; Cyclin B2 remained unphosphorylated (proven by the presence of a doublet of isoforms), and Cdc2 phosphorylation on Tyr15 confirmed that MPF heterodimer was under an inactive form in these oocytes (compare lanes 1, 2, and 8). Accumulation of β-catenin was also examined as a marker of the meiotic process. β-Catenin accumulates during G2/M transition due to inhibition of GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3β) that phosphorylates β-catenin on a PEST sequence, leading to its degradation by the proteasome system (35Wu G. He X. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5319-5323Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In a previous work, we reported that β-catenin O-GlcNAc content was enhanced after progesterone stimulation (22Lefebvre T. Baert F. Bodart J.F. Flament S. Michalski J.C. Vilain J.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 999-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As expected, β-catenin was easily detected in oocytes incubated solely with progesterone or with low concentrations of alloxan (1 and 2 mm). Expression of β-catenin was dramatically reduced when alloxan was used at higher concentrations (Fig. 1B, bottom). At the cytological level, high concentrations of alloxan prevented meiotic spindle formation, as proved by the presence of an intact germinal vesicle envelope (Fig. 2C). Meiotic spindles detected were similar in oocytes treated with uracil (Fig. 2D) to those examined in control mature oocytes (Fig. 2B). To check for the nontoxicity and reversibility of alloxan effect, oocytes that were incubated with 5 mm ALX were rinsed after overnight treatment and were allowed to reach the G2/M transition in alloxan-free ND96 medium containing progesterone (Fig. 3); in these conditions, more than half of the rinsed oocytes exhibited GVBD (57 ± 8.1%) (Fig. 3A), and removal of alloxan allowed activation of both MAPK and MPF pathways, accumulation of β-catenin, and increase in O-GlcNAc level (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 3 and 4). Since alloxan could interfere with any enzyme using uridine and exert unrelated effects, a benzoxazolinone derivative (XI), another OGT inhibitor (referred to as compound number 5 in Ref. 28Gross B.J. Kraybill B.C. Walker S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 14588-14589Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), has been tested for its ability to block M-phase entry. Prior to hormonal stimulation, oocytes were incubated with 5 mm alloxan (Fig. 4, lane 3) or 500 μm benzoxazolinone derivative (lane 4) or without any inhibitor (lane 2). As for alloxan, the benzoxazolinone derivative blocked G2/M transition; MPF and MAPK pathways were not activated, and the O-GlcNAc level did not increase after stimulation with progesterone. M-phase Entry Inhibition Induced by Alloxan Does Not Depend upon Reactive Oxygen Species Formation—Free radicals have been reported to presumably control cell cycle (e.g. through Cdc25 regulation) (36Rudolph J. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2005; 7: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). When in solution, alloxan is in equilibrium with its reduction product, dialuric acid, which generates superoxide radicals (O2⋅¯) through a redox cycle (for a review, see Ref. 37Szkudelski T. Physiol. Res. 2001; 50: 536-546Google Scholar). These superoxide radicals are used by SOD to generate hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Within cells, hydrogen peroxide molecules sustain the Fenton reaction in the presence of Fe2+ ions and are then splinted into two hydroxyl radicals (OH·). To counteract potentially alloxan-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, alloxan-treated oocytes were incubated with SOD and catalase (which produces H2O and ½ O2 from H2O2) either 1 h prior to the progesterone addition (Fig. 5, lanes 4 and 6) or overnight prior to progesterone addition (Fig. 5, lanes 8 and 10). In these conditions, the presence of the two detoxifying enzymes did not prevent the action of alloxan at concentrations ranging from 3 to 5 mm: 1) GVBD did not occur following progesterone stimulation (Fig. 5A); 2) O-GlcNAc levels did not increase; and 3) Rsk, p42 MAPK, and cyclin B2 phosphorylation patterns, as well as the β-catenin accumulation profile, were typical of oocytes arrested in G2 (Fig. 5B). Finally, oocytes were also incubated in increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 5 mm). Although losing their pigmentation for 3, 4, and 5 mm H2O2, oocytes nevertheless underwent GVBD, as shown by hemisection along the animal-vegetal axis after heat fixation (Fig. 6A; data not shown). Thus, G2/M progression was not impaired by H2O2. Staining with anti-O-GlcNAc, anti-Rsk1, anti-phospho-MAPK, anti-cyclin B2, anti-phospho-Tyr15-Cdc2, and anti-β-catenin showed that oocyte incubation with hydrogen peroxide did not prevent progesterone-induced G2/M transition (Fig. 6B). Alloxan Blocks O-GlcNAc Glycosylation and G2/M Transition Induced by Egg Cytoplasm Injection—G2/M transition induced by progesterone depends upon protein synthesis. However, when metaphase II-arrested oocyte (or egg) cytoplasm is injected into immature recipient oocytes, it triggers G2/M transition through the MPF autoamplification loop, independently of protein synthesis (12Wasserman W.J. Masui Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1975; 91: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In comparison with progesterone-treated oocytes, cytoplasm-injected oocytes exhibited no decrease in O-GlcNAc content following 3 mm alloxan incubation (Fig. 7B, top). They also exhibited a typical pattern of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and β-catenin accumulation similar to those of M-phase oocytes (Fig. 7B): 1) cdc2 Tyr15 was dephosphorylated; 2) Rsk and cyclin B2 were phosphorylated; and 3) β-ca"
https://openalex.org/W2076562512,"We have generated an antiserum to the variable domain of mouse collagen XXVII, a recently discovered novel member of the fibrillar collagen family. Collagen XXVII protein was first detectable in the mouse at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5). By E14.5, the protein localized to cartilage, developing dermis, cornea, the inner limiting membrane of the retina, and major arteries of the heart. However, at E18.5, collagen XXVII protein was no longer apparent in most tissues and appeared restricted mainly to cartilage where expression continued into adulthood. Type XXVII collagen immunolocalized to 10-nm-thick nonstriated fibrils that were distinct from fibrils formed by the classical fibrillar collagens. The transient nature of its expression and unusual fibrillar structure suggest that collagen XXVII plays a developmental role distinct from those of the classical fibrillar collagens."
https://openalex.org/W2048010075,"Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, has an unusual ATP-dependent hexokinase (TcHK) that is not affected by d-glucose 6-phosphate, but is non-competitively inhibited by inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), suggesting a heterotropic modulator effect. In a previous study we identified a novel family of bisphosphonates, metabolically stable analogs of PPi, which are potent and selective inhibitors of TcHK as well as the proliferation of the clinically relevant intracellular amastigote form of the parasite in vitro (Hudock, M. P., Sanz-Rodriguez, C. E., Song, Y., Chan, J. M., Zhang, Y., Odeh, S., Kosztowski, T., Leon-Rossell, A., Concepcion, J. L., Yardley, V., Croft, S. L., Urbina, J. A., and Oldfield, E. (2006) J. Med. Chem. 49, 215–223). In this work, we report a detailed kinetic analysis of the effects of three of these bisphosphonates on homogeneous TcHK, as well as on the enzyme in purified intact glycosomes, peroxisome-like organelles that contain most of the glycolytic pathway enzymes in this organism. We also investigated the effects of the same compounds on glucose consumption by intact and digitonin-permeabilized T. cruzi epimastigotes, and on the growth of such cells in liver-infusion tryptose medium. The bisphosphonates investigated were several orders of magnitude more active than PPi as non-competitive or mixed inhibitors of TcHK and blocked the use of glucose by the epimastigotes, inducing a metabolic shift toward the use of amino acids as carbon and energy sources. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between the IC50 values for TcHK inhibition and those for epimastigote growth inhibition for the 12 most potent compounds of this series. Finally, these bisphosphonates did not affect the sterol composition of the treated cells, indicating that they do not act as inhibitors of farnesyl diphosphate synthase. Taken together, our results suggest that these novel bisphosphonates act primarily as specific inhibitors of TcHK and may represent a novel class of selective anti-T. cruzi agents.

Chagas disease remains the major parasitic disease burden in Latin America, despite recent advances in the control of its vectorial and transfusional transmission (1World Health OrganizationTech. Rep. Ser. 2002; 905: 1-109Google Scholar, 2Dias J.C. Silveira A.C. Schofield C.J. Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz. 2002; 97: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Specific chemotherapy against its etiological agent, the kinetoplastid parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is unsatisfactory because current drugs have very limited efficacy in the prevalent, chronic phase of the disease, and there are frequent serious side effects (3Urbina J.A. Docampo R. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 495-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Thus, there is an urgent need for safer and more potent drugs to treat this condition, and several rational approaches are being developed, exploiting key biochemical differences between the parasite and its mammalian hosts (3Urbina J.A. Docampo R. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 495-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 4Coura J.R. de Castro S.L. Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz. 2002; 97: 3-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). In this context, it is of note that T. cruzi, and several related kinetoplastid protozoa, have several unusual characteristics in their energy metabolism, which differentiates them from other eukaryotes. 1) Most of the glycolytic pathway is compartmentalized in peroxisome-like organelles termed glycosomes (5Taylor M.B. Gutteridge W.E. Exp. Parasitol. 1987; 63: 84-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 6Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 41: 127-151Google Scholar). 2) The classic, allosteric modulators of the two key regulatory enzymes of the glycolytic pathway in mammalian, fungal, and bacterial organisms, hexokinase and phosphofructokinase, do not affect the kinetoplastid enzymes (7Urbina J.A. Crespo A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 11: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 8Taylor M. Gutteridge W.E.

This is associated with the absence of a Pasteur effect in these parasites, in addition to their flexibility in utilizing glucose or amino acids as carbon and energy sources (10Urbina J.A. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 107-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Cazzulo J.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3153-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 12Cazzulo J.J. Subcell. Biochem. 1992; 18: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 3) Kinetoplastid parasites contain large stores of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) and other short chain polyphosphates, which are by far the most abundant high energy compounds in these cells (13Moreno B.

Although earlier work had shown that T. cruzi ATP-dependent hexokinase (TcHK) 2The abbreviations used are: TcHK, Trypanosoma cruzi ATP-dependent hexokinase; FPPS, farnesyl diphosphate synthase; LIT, liver infusion tryptose; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate. was not inhibited by its main regulator in vertebrates, d-glucose 6-phosphate (7Urbina J.A.

Pharmacol. 1995; 126: 65-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), more recent studies have shown that this enzyme is inhibited in a non-competitive manner (with respect to ATP) by PPi, with a Ki of ∼500 μm, suggesting that PPi acts as an heterotropic, allosteric regulator (17Caceres A.J. Portillo R. Acosta H. Rosales D. Quinones W. Avilan L. Salazar L. Dubourdieu M. Michels P.A. Concepcion J.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we identified a novel family of metabolically stable PPi analogs called bisphosphonates, which are potent and selective inhibitors of TcHK, as well as the proliferation of the clinically relevant intracellular amastigote form of the parasite (18Hudock M.P. Sanz-Rodriguez C.E. Song Y. Chan J.M. Zhang Y. Odeh S. Kosztowski T. Leon-Rossell A. Concepcion J.L. Yardley V. Croft S.L. Urbina J.A. Oldfield E. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We carried out a QSAR study of 42 compounds and were able to construct pharmacophore and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) models for enzyme inhibition (18Hudock M.P. Sanz-Rodriguez C.E. Song Y. Chan J.M. Zhang Y. Odeh S. Kosztowski T. Leon-Rossell A. Concepcion J.L. Yardley V. Croft S.L. Urbina J.A. Oldfield E. J. Med.

However, at that point, no information was available on the mechanism of enzyme inhibition or on the biochemical and physiological effects of these bisphosphonates on the target cells. In the present work, we selected three compounds from the series (Fig. 1), including the two most potent ones, (9-ethyl-9H-3-carbazolyl)-aminomethylene-1,1-bisphosphonate (228), IC50 = 0.81 μm, and (3-bromo-phenyl)-aminomethylene-1,1-bisphosphonate (302), IC50 = 0.95 μm; and one of intermediate activity (2-(pyridin-4-yl)-1-hydroxyethane-1,1-bisphosphonate (3), IC50 = 12.7 μm, to carry out a detailed kinetic study of their inhibitory activity against TcHK, as well as to investigate their effects on glucose consumption, energy metabolism, and growth of the extracellular epimastigote form of the parasite. The results show that these compounds are very potent, non-competitive or mixed inhibitors of TcHK that block glucose consumption by intact parasites, leading to a metabolic shift in these cells to the use amino acids as carbon and energy sources. Furthermore, we found that growth inhibition induced by the 12 more potent bisphosphonates of the series was highly correlated with TcHK inhibition. Finally, in agreement with our previous results (18Hudock M.P. Sanz-Rodriguez C.E. Song Y. Chan J.M. Zhang Y. Odeh S. Kosztowski T. Leon-Rossell A. Concepcion J.L. Yardley V. Croft S.L. Urbina J.A. Oldfield E. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), it was found that the biochemical activity of 228 and 302 was highly selective: they do not affect the parasites sterol composition, which showed that they do not inhibit farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), a known target of other nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates in eukaryotes, including T. cruzi (20Gabelli S.B.

Parasite—The EP (24De Maio A. Urbina J.A. Acta Cient. Venez. 1984; 35: 136-141PubMed Google Scholar) stock of T. cruzi was used in this study. Handling of live T. cruzi was performed according to established guidelines (25Hudson L. Grover F. Gutteridge W.E. Klein R.A. Peters W. Neal R.A. Miles M.A. Scott M.T. Nourish R. Ager B.P. Trans. R.

T. cruzi Cultivation and Antiproliferative Activities of Bisphosphonates—The epimastigote form of the parasite was cultivated in liver infusion tryptose (LIT) medium (24De Maio A. Urbina J.A. Acta Cient. Venez. 1984; 35: 136-141PubMed Google Scholar), supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (Invitrogen) at 28 °C, with strong agitation (120 rpm). The cultures were initiated at a cell density of 2 × 106 epimastigotes ml–1 and cell densities were measured with an electronic particle counter (model ZBI; Coulter Electronics Inc., Hialeah, FL) and by direct counting with a hemocytometer. Cell viability was followed by trypan blue exclusion, using light microscopy. Experimental compounds were added as sterile, 100-fold stocks at a cell density of 1–2 × 107 epimastigotes ml–1. Growth inhibition was quantified by defining a percent growth factor: % GF = (GFdrug/GFcontrol) × 100, where GF = ((CD)96h – (CD)0h)/(CD)0h), and GFdrug is the growth factor in the presence of a given concentration of the drug, GFcontrol is the corresponding value for untreated cells, and (CD)xh are the cell densities of the cultures at x hours after the addition of the drug. IC50 values were calculated from the % GFs by non-linear correlation with the GraFit software package (Erithacus Software Ltd., Surrey, UK) and statistical analyses were carried out with the JMP 6.0 statistical package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Glucose and ammonium concentrations in the growth medium were determined using enzymatic assays, as described (7Urbina J.A. Crespo A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 11: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 26Urbina J.A. Azavache V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 11: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). TcHK Isolation, Purification, and Assay—T. cruzi hexokinase was purified to homogeneity from exponential phase epimastigotes as described by Caceres et al. (17Caceres A.J. Portillo R. Acosta H.

Parasitol. 2003; 126: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); the slope for the change in absorbance as a function of time was constant for at least 5 min and this value was taken to calculate the initial reaction velocities. Isolation and Purification of Glycosomes and Assay of TcHK Activity in Situ—Highly purified intact glycosomes were obtained from exponential phase epimastigotes as described (27Concepcion J.L. Gonzalez-Pacanowska D. Urbina J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); latencies, defined as: % latency = 100 × (TcHK activity of glycosomes in 0.2% Triton X-100 – TcHK activity of intact glycosomes/TcHK activity of glycosomes in 0.2% Triton X-100), were typically >95% (Triton X-100 concentration is v/v). Glycosomes were incubated in the presence of digitonin (25 μg mg–1 of protein) for 1 min, centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 2 min, suspended in buffer A (sucrose 225 mm, KCl 20 mm, KH2PO4 10 mm, Na2EDTA 5 mm, Tris-HCl 20 mm, MgCl2 1 mm, pH 7.2) and assayed for hexokinase activity, as described above. Analysis of Kinetic Data—Initial velocity data were obtained as a function of substrate (S) and inhibitor (I) concentrations, keeping the co-substrate concentration at saturating levels and fitted data to the following equation (28Urbina J.A. Osorno C.E. Rojas A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar): 1/V = (1 + [I]/Kii)/Vm + (1 + [I]/Kis)Km/Vm[S]. Where Km and Vm are the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant and maximal velocity, respectively, and Kii = [E′S][I]/[E′SI]; Kis = [E′][I]/[E′], where [E′]is the concentration of the enzyme in the presence of fixed concentrations of co-substrate and co-factors. Glucose Consumption by Digitonin-permeabilized Epimastigotes—Exponential phase epimastigotes were collected by centrifugation (4,000 × g for 10 min), resuspended in buffer B (Tris-HCl 75 mm, NaCl 140 mm, KCl 11 mm, pH 7.4) at a final cell density of 108 cells ml–1 and incubated in the presence of digitonin at 30 μgmg–1 protein for 20 min, washed twice in the same buffer, and finally resuspended in buffer B, supplemented with phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) 6 mm, ADP 6 mm, NaHCO3 7 mm, l-malate 1 mm. The parasites were preincubated at 28 °C with strong agitation (100 rpm) in the presence of varying concentrations of bisphosphonates for 60 min, and the experiment were started by addition of 3 mm d-glucose; 100-μl samples were taken every 15 min, centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants stored at –80 °C until assayed for d-glucose content, as described above (7Urbina J.A.

Osorno C.E. Rojas A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Exponential phase epimastigotes were collected by centrifugation and washed in buffer B as described above, resuspended at a cell density of 1010 cells ml–1 in the same buffer, preincubated with strong agitation (100 rpm) at 28 °C in the presence of 50 μm 228 or 302 for 6 h, and the experiment started by the addition of 10 mm 1-d-[13C]glucose (Sigma); 1-ml samples were collected every 30 min, centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants stored at –80 °C until assayed by 13C NMR. Perchloric acid extracts of the sediments (whole cells) were prepared as described before (14Urbina J.A. Moreno B. Vierkotter S. Oldfield E. Payares G. Sanoja C. Bailey B.N. Yan W. Scott D.A.

Three independent experiments were carried out, with essentially identical results. Studies of Lipid Composition—For the analysis of the effects of the experimental compounds on epimastigote lipid composition, total lipids from control and drug-treated cells were extracted and fractionated into neutral and polar lipid fractions by silicic acid column chromatography and gas-liquid chromatography (29Urbina J.A.

The neutral lipid fractions were first analyzed by thin layer chromatography (on Merck 5721 silica gel plates with heptane/isopropyl ether/glacial acetic acid (60:40:4) as developing solvent) and conventional gas-liquid chromatography (isothermal separation in a 4-m glass column packed with 3% OV-1 on Chromosorb 100/200 mesh, with nitrogen as carrier gas at 24 ml min–1 and flame ionization detection using a Varian 3700 gas chromatograph). For quantitative analysis and structural assignments, the neutral lipids were separated in a high-resolution capillary column (25 m × 0.20-mm inner diameter Ultra-2 column, 5% phenylmethylsiloxane, 0.33 μm film thickness) using a Hewlett-Packard 6890 Plus gas chromatograph equipped with a HP5973N mass sensitive detector. The lipids were dissolved in chloroform and injected; the column was kept a 50 °C for 1 min, then the temperature was increased to 270 °C at a rate of 25 °C min–1 and finally to 300 °C at a rate of 1 °C min–1. The carrier gas (He) flow was kept constant at 0.5 ml min–1. Injector temperature was 250 °C and the detector was kept at 280 °C.

Against the pure enzyme (Fig. 2 and Table 1) all three compounds behaved as mixed to non-competitive inhibitors against ATP, as indicated by the similar values of Kii and Kis. Against d-glucose, 228 and 302 exhibited competitive behavior (data not shown), but compound 3 was again a non-competitive inhibitor (Table 1). In all cases, the values of the inhibitory constants were 100–1000-fold lower that the Ki values obtained for PPi in our previous study (500 μm, see Ref. (17Caceres A.J. Portillo R. Acosta H.

Open table in a new tab TcHK, as well as the five subsequent enzymes of the glycolytic pathway in T. cruzi and related organisms, functions in vivo in the matrix of the glycosomes, membrane bound peroxisome-like organelles in which protein concentrations can be as high as 350 mg ml–1 (5Taylor M.B. Gutteridge W.E. Exp. Parasitol. 1987; 63: 84-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 6Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 41: 127-151Google Scholar). In an effort to study the activity of this enzyme under more natural conditions, we next investigated its kinetic properties and inhibition by bisphosphonates in highly purified glycosomes, made permeable to small molecules by briefly incubating with digitonin. The use of this plant glycoside detergent to permeabilize the glycosomal membrane was suggested by previous studies from our group, which showed that it was rich in the endogenous sterols of the parasite (31Quinones W. Urbina J.A. Dubourdieu M. Concepcion J.L. Exp. Parasitol. 2004; 106: 135-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), plus that the glycosome is one the organelles involved in de novo sterol biosynthesis in this parasite (27Concepcion J.L. Gonzalez-Pacanowska D. Urbina J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Preliminary data indicated that incubation of glycosomes in the presence of 25 μg of digitonin/mg of protein for 1 min allowed full expression of TcHK activity with <5% release of the enzyme (or other glycosomal markers, such as phosphoglucose isomerase) from the matrix of the organelle. Because the in situ activity of this enzyme had not been reported previously, a detailed kinetic study was carried out; the results (not shown) indicated classical Michaelis-Menten behavior, with Km values of 463 and 30 μm for ATP and d-glucose, respectively, and a Vm value of 11.5 μmol min–1 mg of protein–1. We also investigated the inhibitory effects of PPi on the in situ TcHK activity and found that it was purely non-competitive toward ATP (Kii = Kis = 819 μm), but mixed toward d-glucose (Table 2). The values of Km for ATP and the Ki for PPi for the glycosomal enzyme were significantly higher than those previously obtained for the pure enzyme (17Caceres A.J. Portillo R. Acosta H. Rosales D.

When we investigated the kinetics of inhibition of the enzyme in glycosomes (Fig. 3 and Table 2), we found that 228 and 3 were again mixed to non-competitive inhibitors toward ATP, but 302 produced an apparently competitive inhibition; all compounds were non-competitive or mixed inhibitors against d-glucose (data not shown, Table 2). Again, the values of the inhibitory constants for bisphosphonates against this form of the enzyme were 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than were those for PPi (Table 2). Effects of Bisphosphonates on Glucose Consumption by Digitonin-permeabilized and Intact T. cruzi Epimastigotes—Next, we investigated the effect of bisphosphonates on the glucose consumption by whole, digitonin-permeabilized T. cruzi epimastigotes. Previous work had shown that incubation of these cells with digitonin at 30 μgmg–1 protein for 20 min render their plasma membranes permeable to both low and high molecular weight compounds, but no glycosomal proteins were released (27Concepcion J.L. Gonzalez-Pacanowska D. Urbina J.A. Arch. Biochem.

This conversion is catalyzed by a heterotrimeric amidotransferase GatCAB in the presence of ATP and an amide donor (Gln or Asn). Helicobacter pylori has a single GatCAB enzyme required in vivo for both Gln-tRNAGln and Asn-tRNAAsn synthesis. In vitro characterization reveals that the enzyme transamidates Asp-tRNAAsn and Glu-tRNAGln with similar efficiency (kcat/Km of 1368.4 s-1/mm and 3059.3 s-1/mm respectively). The essential glutaminase activity of the enzyme is a property of the A-subunit, which displays the characteristic amidase signature sequence. Mutations of the GatA catalytic triad residues (Lys52, Ser128, Ser152) abolished glutaminase activity and consequently the amidotransferase activity with glutamine as the amide donor. However, the latter activity was rescued when the mutant enzymes were presented with ammonium chloride. The presence of Asp-tRNAAsn and ATP enhances the glutaminase activity about 22-fold. H. pylori GatCAB uses the amide donor glutamine 129-fold more efficiently than asparagine, suggesting that GatCAB is a glutamine-dependent amidotransferase much like the unrelated asparagine synthetase B. Genomic analysis suggests that most bacteria synthesize asparagine in a glutamine-dependent manner, either by a tRNA-dependent or in a tRNA-independent route. However, all known bacteria that contain asparagine synthetase A form Asn-tRNAAsn by direct acylation catalyzed by asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase. Therefore, bacterial amide aminoacyl-tRNA formation is intimately tied to amide amino acid metabolism.

Therefore, bacterial amide aminoacyl-tRNA formation is intimately tied to amide amino acid metabolism. The accurate pairing of an amino acid with its cognate tRNA is essential for the fidelity of protein biosynthesis. In a living cell this pairing is usually performed by the family of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), 5The abbreviations used are: aaRS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; GlnRS, glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase; AsnRS, asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase; ND, non-discriminating; AdT, tRNA-dependent amidotransferase; GluRS, glutamyl-tRNA synthetase; Glu-AdT, glutamyl-tRNAGln-dependent amidotransferase; AspRS, aspartyl-tRNA synthetase; Asp-AdT, aspartyl-tRNAAsn-dependent amidotransferase; PEI, polyethylenimine; TLC, thin layer chromatography; DTT, dithiothreitol. a set of twenty enzymes each specific for its cognate amino acid (1Ibba M. Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). However, most bacterial and all known archaeal genomes do not encode a glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) responsible for Gln-tRNAGln formation. In addition, many prokaryotes do not possess an asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase (AsnRS). These organisms maintain an indirect pathway of Gln-tRNAGln or Asn-tRNAAsn synthesis, which takes advantage of a non-discriminating (ND) aaRS and a tRNA-dependent amidotransferase (AdT) (2Ibba M. Söll D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In prokaryotes lacking a GlnRS, a non-discriminating glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (ND-GluRS) (3Lapointe J. Duplain L. Proulx M. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 88-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) forms the misacylated Glu-tRNAGln, which is subsequently converted by amidation to Gln-tRNAGln catalyzed by a glutamyl-tRNAGln amidotransferase (Glu-AdT) in the presence of an amide donor (4Curnow A.W.

A. 1968; 61: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In an analogous tRNA-dependent amidation pathway many prokaryotes employ a non-discriminating aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (ND-AspRS) and aspartyl-tRNAAsn amidotransferase (Asp-AdT) to form Asn-tRNAAsn (7Curnow A.W. Ibba M. Söll D. Nature. 1996; 382: 589-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 8Akochy P.M. Bernard D. Roy P.H. Lapointe J. J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 6083-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The AdT enzymes catalyze three distinct reactions to accomplish transamidation of their mischarged tRNA substrates. (i) AdTs hydrolyze ATP to phosphorylate the carboxyl group of the Glu or Asp moiety attached to the tRNA, thus forming an activated intermediate (10Wilcox M. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1969; 34: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Feng L. Sheppard K. Tumbula-Hansen D. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8150-8155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). (ii) AdTs hydrolyze an amide donor such as Gln or Asn to liberate ammonia. (iii) AdTs use the liberated ammonia to amidate the activated intermediate to form the cognate aa-tRNA species, Gln-tRNAGln or Asn-tRNAAsn. Two AdTs are found in nature, a heterotrimeric (GatCAB) and a heterodimeric (GatDE) enzyme. The latter is present only in Archaea and functions solely in Gln-tRNAGln formation as a Glu-AdT (5Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D. Chang W.Z. Söll D. Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, GatCAB is found in both prokaryotic domains of life (5Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D. Chang W.Z. Söll D. Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and also in chloroplasts (12Schön A. Kannangara C.G. Gough S. Söll D. Nature. 1988; 331: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To date all GatCAB enzymes have shown the ability to act as both a Glu-AdT and an Asp-AdT in vitro (5Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D.

Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These subunits catalyze the formation of the activated intermediate (reaction i), and its subsequent amidation to the correctly charged tRNA species (reaction iii) (11Feng L. Sheppard K.

For both AdTs, it is suspected that the binding of the misacylated tRNA induces a conformational change that activates their glutaminase activities, thereby tightly coupling ammonia liberation with the amidation of the misacylated tRNA species (11Feng L. Sheppard K. Tumbula-Hansen D. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8150-8155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Nakamura A. Yao M. Chimnaronk S. Sakai N. Tanaka I.

Structure. 2005; 13: 1421-1433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In vivo, the role of GatCAB is likely determined by the nature of the misacylated tRNA species (Glu-tRNAGln or Asp-tRNAAsn) present in the cell. For example, Bacillus subtilis has a ND-GluRS but not a ND-AspRS; thus it only forms Glu-tRNAGln and its GatCAB acts in vivo only as a Glu-AdT (4Curnow A.W. Hong K. Yuan R. Kim S. Martins O. Winkler W. Henkin T.M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11819-11826Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Pseudomonas contains a ND-AspRS but lacks a ND-GluRS; thus its GatCAB enzyme is thought to act solely as an Asp-AdT (8Akochy P.M. Bernard D. Roy P.H. Lapointe J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 767-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In other bacteria, e.g. Chlamydia trachomatis and Helicobacter pylori, that lack AsnRS and GlnRS, GatCAB is the sole AdT encoded in their genomes and is responsible for both Asn-tRNAAsn and Gln-tRNAGln formation (14Raczniak G. Becker H. Min B. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45862-45867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Chuawong P. Hendrickson T.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8079-8087Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A portion of the archaeal genomes (e.g. Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus) are deficient in both GlnRS and AsnRS; however they all encode a ND-GluRS and a ND-AspRS along with two AdTs, GatCAB, and GatDE (5Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D. Chang W.Z. Söll D. Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Given that GatDE is only a Glu-AdT for Gln-tRNAGln formation, the role of GatCAB in these Archaea is presumably as an Asp-AdT to form Asn-tRNAAsn (5Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D. Chang W.Z. Söll D. Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), although this has not been experimentally verified. A few biochemical investigations of the GatCAB enzymes have appeared using different enzyme assays. The Streptococcus pyogenes enzyme was examined in its overall reaction, and its glutaminase activity was found to be enhanced by Glu-tRNAGln (18Horiuchi K.Y. Harpel M.R. Shen L. Luo Y. Rogers K.C. Copel- and R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6450-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Some information has been obtained on the tRNA identity of the Staphylococcus aureus (15Nakamura A. Yao M. Chimnaronk S. Sakai N. Tanaka I. Science. 2006; 312: 1954-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), Neisseria meningitidis (9Bailly M. Giannouli S. Blaise M. Stathopoulos C. Kern D.

FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) enzymes. While there are differing reports on the preference of the enzyme for Gln over Asn as amide donor (5Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D. Chang W.Z. Söll D. Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 22Jahn D. Kim Y.C. Ishino Y. Chen M.W. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8059-8064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the crystal structures of S. aureus GatCAB complexed with Gln or Asn suggested that Gln is the better amide donor (15Nakamura A. Yao M. Chimnaronk S. Sakai N. Tanaka I. Science. 2006; 312: 1954-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Here we present our data on the H. pylori GatCAB enzyme; it employs its Glu-AdT and Asp-AdT activities equally and shows a distinct preference for glutamine as amide donor.

[l-14C]glutamine (224 mCi/mmol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO) and [α-32P]ATP (10 mmol/μCi) was from Amersham Biosciences (GE Healthcare). Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA). Bio-Spin 30 columns were from Bio-Rad. High purity cold l-Glu, l-Asp, l-Gln, and l-Asn were from Fluka (Deisenhofen, Germany). Phenol was from American Bioanalytical (Natick, MA). H. pylori tRNA Purification—The E. coli strain XL1-Blue harboring the full-length H. pylori tRNAGln or H. pylori tRNAAsn plasmid pGFIB was grown for 24 h at 37 °C shaking at 250 rpm in Luria broth (LB) with 100 μg/ml of ampicillin for constitutive overexpression. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2700 × g for 20 min, resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, for phenol (Tris-buffered, pH 7.9) extraction, ethanol-precipitated with 1/10 volume of 20% potassium acetate and two volumes of cold ethanol and spun at 4000 × g for 40 min. The nucleic acid pellet was resuspended in 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9, for deacylation, ethanol-precipitated with the addition of 1/10 volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5, and two volumes of cold ethanol, and spun at 4000 × g for 40 min. To remove DNA, the pellet was resuspended in 1 m NaCl, incubated at room temperature for 4 h, and centrifuged at 4000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 0.2 m NaCl. The resuspended nucleic acids were loaded onto a Qiagen-tip 100 column, washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.2 m NaCl, and total tRNA was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.7 m NaCl and 15% ethanol buffer. H. pylori tRNAAsn and tRNAGln were purified from the total tRNA as described using complementary DNA probes, (5′-ATGTAGGATTGGAACCTACGACCAAGCGGTTAACAGCCG-3′ for tRNAAsn and 5′-TGCAAGGATTCGAACCTCGGAATGCCAGGACCAAAACCT-3′ for tRNAGln), biotinylated on their 5′-ends yielding H. pylori tRNA over 95% pure as determined by dot-blot and hybridization gel shifts (23Kaneko T. Suzuki T. Kapushoc S.T. Rubio M.A. Ghazvini J. Watanabe K. Simpson L. Suzuki T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The link between the DNA and biotin for the H. pylori tRNAGln probe was particularly labile. Following purification, the tRNAGln samples were treated with RNase-free DNase (Roche Applied Science), phenol (citrate buffered, pH 4.5)/chloroform-extracted, and passed over a Bio-Spin 30 column to remove the DNA probe. H. pylori GatCAB Purification—H. pylori gatCAB was cloned between the NdeI and BamHI sites in pET15b (pET15b-Hpgat-CAB), which was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3), and the resultant cells grown on LB-agar plates with 100 μg/ml of ampicillin. A fresh colony was picked and grown for 12 h at 37 °C, shaking in 7.5 ml of LB plus 100 μg/ml of ampicillin. The culture was used to inoculate 750 ml of LB supplemented with 100 μg/ml of ampicillin, 5052 solution, and phosphate buffer for autoinduction as previously described (24Studier F.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). The cultures were grown at 37 °C shaking at 250 rpm for 18 h. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2700 × g for 20 min and resuspended in 35 ml of wash buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm benzamide, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol) with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.2 mg of lysozyme (Sigma) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The cell suspension was sonicated for 20 s, six times on a Branson Sonifier 250 (VWR Scientific, West Chester, PA) at a 50% duty cycle and 60% output. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 90 min. 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose slurry was added to the supernatant, and the protein was purified according to manufacturer's protocols. The eluted protein was dialyzed in buffer A (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 5.0 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA) and purified further by fast protein liquid chromatography on a MonoQ column (Amersham Biosciences). It was developed with a 20 mm to 750 mm KCl gradient in buffer A. GatCAB eluted between 200 mm and 300 mm KCl. Fractions containing purified GatCAB (>95%) as judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining were pooled together and dialyzed in buffer A with 50% glycerol and stored at -20 °C. Site-directed Mutagenesis of GatCAB in Amidase Active Site—Point mutations were introduced into the amidase active site of GatA at Lys53, Ser128, and Ser152 of the GatCAB holoenzyme using the Stratagene QuikChange kit following manufacturer's protocols. After verification by DNA sequencing, the plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. The mutant proteins were overexpressed and purified as described above for the wild-type enzyme. Pseudomonas aeruginosa AspRS Purification—P. aeruginosa AspRS was overexpressed and purified as previously described (8Akochy P.M. Bernard D. Roy P.H. Lapointe J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 767-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). H. pylori GluRS Purification—The H. pylori GluRS2 was overexpressed and purified as described previously (25Salazar J.C. Ahel I. Orellana O. Tumbula-Hansen D. Krieger R. Daniels L. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13863-13868Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Preparation of Labeled tRNA—Purified full-length H. pylori tRNAGln and tRNAAsn were each separately 32P-labeled on their 3′-termini by using the E. coli CCA-adding enzyme and [α-32P]ATP, as previously described with some modification (17Oshikane H. Sheppard K. Fukai S. Nakamura Y. Ishitani R. Numata T. Sherrer R.L. Feng L. Schmitt E. Panvert M. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. Söll D. Nureki O.

Briefly, 15 μm tRNA in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 50 μm NaPPi was incubated for 35 min. at room temperature with the CCA-adding enzyme and 1.6 μCi/μlof[α-32P] ATP (Amersham Biosciences). The samples were phenol (Tris-buffered, pH 7.9)/chloroform extracted and excess [α-32P]ATP was removed by passing the samples over Bio-Spin 30 columns (26Bullock T.L. Uter N. Nissan T.A. Perona J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Preparation of Glu-tRNAGln—Aminoacylation of H. pylori tRNAGln was carried out in 100 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, with 30 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, and 2 mm DTT with 24 μg/μl of pyrophosphatase (Roche Applied Science), 3 μm H. pylori GluRS2, 1 mm l-Glu, 10 μm unlabeled H. pylori tRNAGln and 600 nm 32P-labeled H. pylori tRNAGln. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. The samples were phenol/chloroform-extracted, and excess ATP was removed as described previously (11Feng L. Sheppard K. Tumbula-Hansen D. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8150-8155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In parallel, samples with only cold tRNA were aminoacylated to be used in the glutaminase assays (see below). To check levels of aminoacylation, 2-μl aliquots at the start and end of the reactions with labeled tRNA were quenched, digested, processed, and quantified as previously described (26Bullock T.L. Uter N. Nissan T.A. Perona J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Preparation of Asp-tRNAAsn—Aminoacylation of H. pylori tRNAAsn was carried out for 14 h at 37 °C. The reaction conditions were as follows: 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.2, with 25 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 5 mm DTT, 0.22 mg/ml P. aeruginosa AspRS, 1 mm l-Asp, 21 μm unlabeled H. pylori tRNAAsn, and 1.33 μm 32P-labeled H. pylori tRNAAsn. The samples were phenol/chloroform-extracted, and excess ATP was removed as described previously (11Feng L. Sheppard K. Tumbula-Hansen D. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8150-8155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) Samples with only cold tRNAAsn were done in parallel to be used in the glutaminase assays (see below). Levels of aminoacylation were checked using the procedure previously described (26Bullock T.L. Uter N. Nissan T.A. Perona J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) except the polyethylenimine (PEI)-cellulose thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ 4474-04, or EMD Chemicals, Darmstadt, Germany, 5725/7) were developed in 1 mm ammonium acetate, 5% acetic acid. Amidotransferase Assays—These were carried out in 1× AdT buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 15 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, and 1 mm DTT) at 37 °C. Unless otherwise noted 4 mm ATP, 9 to 11 μm 32P-labeled mischarged tRNA (Asp-tRNAAsn or Glu-tRNAGln) and 2 mm l-Gln were added. For determination of the kinetic parameters, initial velocities were measured in duplicate while varying concentration of one substrate and saturating with the other two. When l-Gln was used as the amide donor, reactions were carried out over 1 min using 1 nm purified H. pylori GatCAB. For the kinetic parameters using Asn as the amide donor, reactions were carried out over 5 min using 20 nm enzyme. We found our mischarged tRNA species were stable over these time periods. Reaction mixes were preincubated at 37 °C and started by the addition of H. pylori Gat-CAB. At each time point 2-μl aliquots of the reaction were quenched and digested with 3 μl of 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.74, and 0.66 mg/ml of nuclease P1 (Sigma) and spotted onto PEI-cellulose 20 × 20 cm TLC plates as previously described (17Oshikane H.

Science. 2006; 312: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To separate the glutaminyl-AMP (Gln-AMP) from Glu-AMP and AMP, the TLC plates were developed in 100 mm ammonium acetate, 5% acetic acid as described previously (17Oshikane H. Sheppard K. Fukai S. Nakamura Y. Ishitani R. Numata T. Sherrer R.L. Feng L. Schmitt E. Panvert M. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. Söll D. Nureki O.

To separate asparaginyl-AMP (Asn-AMP) from Asp-AMP and AMP (see Fig. 1), the plates were developed in 1 mm ammonium acetate and 5% acetic acid for 90–120 min. The plates were visualized and quantified as described previously (17Oshikane H. Sheppard K. Fukai S. Nakamura Y. Ishitani R. Numata T. Sherrer R.L. Feng L. Schmitt E. Panvert M. Blanquet S.

Kaleidagraph v. 3.6 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) was used to calculate the kinetic parameters using nonlinear regression plots of the initial velocity versus substrate concentration (either Gln, Asn, ATP, Glu-tRNAGln, or Asp-tRNAAsn) and are reported in Table 1.TABLE 1Kinetic data for H. pylori GatCAB, amidotransferase activity Steady-state kinetics of H. pylori GatCAB amidotransferase activity is shown.

The l-Gln concentration varied from as low as 4 μm up to 960 μm.[l-14C]Gln was used. For the higher concentrations, cold l-Gln was added in addition to the [l-14C]Gln. In the absence of mischarged tRNA, 10 nm H. pylori GatCAB was used. In the presence of mischarged tRNA but in the absence of ATP, 1 nm of enzyme was used. When both ATP and mischarged tRNA were present in excess, 0.1 nm enzyme was added. Reactions were carried out over 8 min. At each time point, aliquots were quenched with 0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, ethanol-precipitated, and the supernatant was dried and resuspended as previously described (11Feng L. Sheppard K.

We divided 157 bird species showing regular intercontinental movements into four groups based on patterns of movement—one of these groups (breed Holarctic, winter Eurasia) fits well with the design of the monitoring programs (i.e., western Alaska), but the other groups have quite different movement patterns, which would suggest the importance of H5N1 monitoring along the Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf coasts of North America."
https://openalex.org/W1971437040,"<i>endo</i>-Glycoceramidase, a membrane-associated family 5 glycosidase, deviates from the typical polysaccharide substrate specificity of other soluble members of the family, preferentially hydrolyzing glycosidic linkages between the oligosaccharide and ceramide moieties of gangliosides. Here we report the first x-ray crystal structures of an <i>endo</i>-glycoceramidase from <i>Rhodococcus</i> sp., in the apo form, in complex with the ganglioside G<sub>M3</sub> (Svennerholm ganglioside nomenclature (Svennerholm, L. (1964) <i>J. Lipid Res.</i> 5, 145-155)), and trapped as a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. These snapshots provide the first molecular insight into enzyme recognition and association with gangliosides, revealing the structural adaptations necessary for glycosidase-catalyzed hydrolysis and detailing a novel ganglioside binding topology. Consistent with the chemical duality of the substrate, the active site of <i>endo</i>-glycoceramidase is split into a wide, polar cavity to bind the polyhydroxylated oligosaccharide moiety and a narrow, hydrophobic tunnel to bind the ceramide lipid chains. The specific interactions with the ceramide polar head group manifest a surprising aglycone specificity, an observation substantiated by our kinetic analyses. Collectively, the reported structural and kinetic data provide insight toward rational redesign of the synthetic glycosynthase mutant of <i>endo</i>-glycoceramidase to enable facile synthesis of nonnatural, therapeutically useful gangliosides."
https://openalex.org/W2074910736,"Assembly of the mitotic spindle is a classic example of macromolecular self-organization. During spindle assembly, microtubules (MTs) accumulate around chromatin. In centrosomal spindles, centrosomes at the spindle poles are the dominating source of MT production. However, many systems assemble anastral spindles, i.e., spindles without centrosomes at the poles. How anastral spindles produce and maintain a high concentration of MTs in the absence of centrosome-catalyzed MT production is unknown. With a combined biochemistry-computer simulation approach, we show that the concerted activity of three components can efficiently concentrate microtubules (MTs) at chromatin: (1) an external stimulus in form of a RanGTP gradient centered on chromatin, (2) a feed-back loop where MTs induce production of new MTs, and (3) continuous re-organization of MT structures by dynamic instability. The mechanism proposed here can generate and maintain a dissipative MT super-structure within a RanGTP gradient."
https://openalex.org/W2080078596,"African sleeping sickness is a fatal disease caused by two parasite subspecies: Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense. We previously reported that trypanosomes have extraordinary low CTP pools compared with mammalian cells. Trypanosomes also lack salvage of cytidine/cytosine making the parasite CTP synthetase a potential target for treatment of the disease. In this study, we have expressed and purified recombinant T. brucei CTP synthetase. The enzyme has a higher Km value for UTP than the mammalian CTP synthetase, which in combination with a lower UTP pool may account for the low CTP pool in trypanosomes. The activity of the trypanosome CTP synthetase is irreversibly inhibited by the glutamine analogue acivicin, a drug extensively tested as an antitumor agent. There is a rapid uptake of acivicin in mice both given intraperitoneally and orally by gavage. Daily injection of acivicin in trypanosome-infected mice suppressed the infection up to one month without any significant loss of weight. Experiments with cultured bloodstream T. brucei showed that acivicin is trypanocidal if present at 1 μm concentration for at least 4 days. Therefore, acivicin may qualify as a drug with “desirable” properties, i.e. cure within 7 days, according to the current Target Product Profiles of WHO and DNDi.

African sleeping sickness is caused by a unicellular protozoan belonging to the class of zooflagellates (1Hickman C.P. Roberts L.S. Larson A. Integrated Principles of Zoology.10th Ed. Brown, Boston1997: 225Google Scholar). Two subspecies are responsible for causing the sickness in humans: Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense. The former one is affecting countries in western and central Africa, causing a chronic form of the sickness where the symptoms will not be evident until months or even years after the infection. T. b. rhodesiense on the other hand, is restricted to eastern and southern Africa, causing an acute illness within a few weeks after the infection (2WHO (1998) WHO Technical Report Series 881, pp. 1-36, GenevaGoogle Scholar). The trypanosomes are spread by tsetse flies and transmitted to humans in fly saliva upon a bite. A variant specific glycoprotein (VSG) coat enables the parasite to escape destruction by the host immune system (3Matthews K.R. J.

DFMO can only cure T. b. gambiense infections. Furthermore, because of the lengthy infusion schedules, it can only be administrated in a hospital setting. Melarsoprol, an old arsenical derivative, also has to be given by infusion but in addition is causing serious side effects such as fatal encephalopathy in as high as 10% of the cases. Furthermore, there is an increasing resistance to Melarsoprol reaching almost 30% in central Africa (2WHO (1998) WHO Technical Report Series 881, pp. 1-36, GenevaGoogle Scholar). Because of the highly variable nature of the glycoprotein coat, all attempts to develop an efficient vaccine have met with little success. CTP pools in trypanosomes were previously demonstrated to be very low compared with other eukaryotic cells and trypanosomes totally lack the ability to salvage cytosine or cytidine (5Hofer A.

For these reasons, T. brucei CTP synthetase, a glutamine amidotransferase responsible for de novo synthesis of CTP, was suggested to be a potential drug target for treatment of African sleeping sickness (6Hofer A. Steverding D. Chabes A. Brun R. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6412-6416Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). CTP synthetase (CTPS) was originally identified 1955 in Escherichia coli by Lieberman, who showed that the enzyme catalyzes the conversion of UTP to CTP in the presence of ATP, ammonia, and magnesium (10Lieberman I.

Like other glutamine amidotransferases, CTPS is inhibited by glutamine analogues (18Ahluwalia G.S. Grem J.L. Hao Z. Cooney D.A. Pharmacol.

We showed earlier that DON (6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine) and acivicin (α-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid) reduced the already low parasitic CTP levels even further and inhibited T. brucei growth in vitro (6Hofer A. Steverding D. Chabes A. Brun R. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6412-6416Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Addition of acivicin to cultured bloodstream T. brucei specifically lowered the parasitic CTP and GTP pools without affecting the ATP and UTP pools indicating that the main targets in the parasite are CTPS and GMP synthetase like in mammalian cells. Addition of guanine, cytosine and cytidine to the growth medium restored the GTP pool but neither restored the CTP pool nor growth. Acivicin is potentially a better drug candidate than DON since it penetrates the blood-brain barrier and has a longer in vivo half-life (20Chikhale E.G. Chikhale P.J. Borchardt R.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21McGovren J. Stewart J. Elfring G. Smith R. Soares N. Wood J. Poplack D. Von Hoff D. Cancer Treat.

However, the ability of tumor cells to salvage purines and pyrimidines provided resistance against acivicin treatment and limited its value as an anti-tumor drug (25Earhart R.H. Neil G.L. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1985; 24: 179-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 29Fischer P.H. Pamukcu R. Bittner G. Willson J.K. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 3355-3359PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have expressed and purified recombinant T. brucei CTPS to homogeneity. Kinetic studies of the pure enzyme indicate that the low CTP pools in trypanosomes are a consequence of the high Km for UTP compared with the mammalian enzyme. The trypanosome CTPS showed the same strong affinity for acivicin as the rat liver enzyme but preincubation of the trypanosome enzyme in the presence of the nucleotide substrates together with acivicin strengthened the inhibition. Our in vivo experiments demonstrate that it is possible to suppress trypanosome infections in mice for at least one month periods using acivicin without serious side effects. Experiments with cultured bloodstream T. brucei in vitro showed that acivicin has a trypanocidal effect if present in 1 μm concentration for at least 4 days. This concentration is well below the concentration of 5 μm in human plasma where CNS toxicity starts to appear if the drug is present more than 16 h (27Earhart R.H. Koeller J.M. Davis T.E. Borden E.C. McGovren J.P. Davis H.L. Tormey D.C. Cancer Treat. Rep. 1983; 67: 683-692PubMed Google Scholar). Analyses of acivicin levels in mouse blood showed that oral administration of drug results in almost the same rapid uptake as intraperitoneal administration with a half-life of about 72 min increasing its potential value for treatment of African sleeping sickness. Plasmid Construction—The T. brucei CTPS gene was amplified from genomic DNA of the TC221 strain using primers with the following sequence: 5′-AGTTAAAACGGTAGACGAGGAG-3′ and 5′-ACACATATATACACTAGACTCGTT-3′. Using the diluted (100×) PCR product as a template, a second round of PCR was performed. This time one of the primers contained an NdeI recognition sequence followed by a His6 coding region and a tobacco etch virus protease recognition sequence preceding the start codon: 5′-CATATGCATCACCATCACCATCACGATTACGATATCCCAACGACCGAAAACCTGTATTTTCAGGGCATGGAAGGCAGTGCAACTGCG-3′. The reverse primer contained an EcoR1 recognition sequence: 5′-GAATTCCGTATCCAAACACAGCGCATC-3′. Upon digestion of the PCR product with EcoR1 and NdeI, the DNA was cloned into a pETM2 vector replacing the M2cDNA (30Mann G.J. Graslund A. Ochiai E. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Recombinant T. brucei CTP Synthetase—His6-TEV protease site-tagged T. brucei CTP synthetase was expressed in BL21(DE3) pLysS bacteria. The cells were grown at 15 °C in Terrific Broth medium supplemented with 84 μm chloramphenicol (USB) and 118 μm carbenicillin (Duchefa Biochemie) until A600 ≈ 12. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation for 20 min at 4000 × g at 4 °C. The cell pellet was washed with ten volumes of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and after centrifugation (as above) resuspended in two volumes of 50 mm Hepes buffer pH 7.3, 0.2 m NaAc. The cells were disrupted by three cycles of freezing and thawing. The crude extract was centrifuged in an ultracentrifuge for 1 h at 150,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was added to a Talon Metal Affinity resin (Clontech) equilibrated with 50 mm Hepes buffer pH 7.3, 0.2 m NaAc and incubated for 1 h at 4°C on a rotary platform. The resin was pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 4 min at 4 °C and washed once with 10 resin volumes of the same buffer. After repelleting, the Talon resin was washed twice with 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.3, 0.2 m NaAc supplemented with 5 mm imidazole. Following the second imidazole wash, the resin was packed into a glass Econo-Column (Bio-Rad), and the CTPS was eluted from the column with 50 mm Hepes buffer pH 7.3, 0.2 m NaAc supplemented with 80 mm imidazole. The eluate was chromatographed through a Sephadex G-50 (Amersham Biosciences) column in 50 mm Hepes buffer pH 7.3, 0.2 m NaAc to remove the imidazole, and the protein-containing fractions were concentrated in a 10-kDa Vivaspin 6 concentrator (Viva Science) at 2000 × g. A Ni-NTA purified His6-TEV protease (the pET9d construct was kindly provided by Günther Stier, EMBL, Heidelberg) was added to the concentrated solution, and proteolysis was performed at 23 °C for 40 min. The protein solution was then loaded again on a Talon resin column but this time the flow-through, containing CTPS without His tag, was collected. Finally a 0.2-ml Source Q 15 medium column (Amersham Biosciences) was packed and equilibrated with 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.3, 0.2 m NaAc. The protein solution was loaded onto the column which was eluted with 5 column volumes of the same buffer. The flow through fractions containing T. brucei CTPS were collected and pooled. After the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 1 mm, the protein solution was frozen and stored at -70 °C. Standard CTPS Activity Assays and Protein Determination—Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. The standard activity assay mixture consisted of 0.1–1 μg of CTPS in 50 μl of reaction buffer (0.2 m KCl, 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 30 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm GTP, 4 mm [3H]UTP (specific activity 18,000 cpm/nmol), 8 mm ATP, 5 mm l-glutamine, and 50 mm Hepes pH 7.3). Before the start of the reaction by the addition of l-glutamine, the reaction mixtures were preincubated at 37 °C for 1 min. The reactions were run for 5 min at the same temperature, stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of 1 m perchloric acid and incubated on ice for 10 min. Before centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 10 min, to remove the precipitated proteins, 250 nmol of carrier CTP were added. The supernatants were boiled in a water bath for 10 min to hydrolyze the nucleotides to monophosphates and then cooled on ice. The samples were neutralized by KOH and centrifuged for 2 min at 21,000 × g at room temperature. Finally, the supernatants were loaded onto glass Econo-columns packed with 4 ml of Dowex 50 Wx8, 400 mesh cation exchange medium (Sigma Aldrich). The columns were first washed with 20 ml of 1 mm HCl followed by a 12 ml wash with 0.2 m HCl. The CMP was eluted in an additional 5 ml of 0.2 m HCl and the concentration determined from the absorbance at 280 nm. The amount of radioactive product was determined by mixing 1 ml of eluate with 10 ml of Ready Safe scintillation liquid (Beckman Coulter) followed by vigorous shaking and counting in a Beckman LS 600 Series Liquid Scintillation System. One unit of CTPS activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 nmol of CTP per minute. Km values were obtained by fitting the data to a hyperbola using the GraphPad Prism program. Inhibition of T. brucei CTPS Activity by Acivicin—Inhibition by acivicin was determined by studying the initial velocity of the enzyme reaction as a function of glutamine concentration at various acivicin concentrations. Using the standard reaction mixture, acivicin was added at the same time as l-glutamine. To be able to compare the inhibition by acivicin of T. brucei CTPS with the published value of the mammalian CTPS, the Ki value for acivicin was obtained from a Dixon plot (31Neil G.L. Berger A.E. McPartland R.P. Grindey G.B. Bloch A. Cancer Res. 1979; 39: 852-856PubMed Google Scholar). The preincubation experiments were performed as follows: Recombinant T. brucei CTPS (0.25 μg/μl) in 50 mm Hepes buffer pH 7.3, 0.2 m KCl was incubated in the presence or absence of 12 μm acivicin, 8 mm ATP, 30 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm GTP, and 4 mm [3H]UTP. The mixtures were preincubated from 1 to 5 min at 37 °C, and then 2 μl were transferred to 48 μl of preincubated standard reaction mixture containing 5 mm l-glutamine. The reactions were stopped after 5 min and processed as above. The same results were obtained with and without DTT in the preincubation mixture. Oligomeric Structure of T. brucei CTPS—Analyses of the various oligomeric forms of recombinant T. brucei CTPS were made by Gas-phase Electrophoretic Mobility Macromolecule/Nanoparticle Analysis (GEMMA) (32Bacher G.

Prior to running the samples in the GEMMA machine, the 50 mm Hepes, 0.2 m NaAc buffer pH 7.3 was changed to the volatile 0.2 m ammonium acetate pH 7.3, using Vivaspin 500 5 kDa concentrators. The sample consisted of 20 μg/ml CTPS in 50 mm ammonium acetate pH 7.3 supplemented with 0.005% Tween 20 and 10 μm MgCl2. For the determination of the oligomerization state in the presence of nucleotide substrates, ATP or UTP was added, either separately or together each at 20 μm. Acivicin Treatment of T. brucei-infected Mice and Acivicin Plasma Measurements—T. brucei (TC221) infected C57Bl male mice weighing 30 g were treated with daily intraperitoneal (intraperitoneal) injections of acivicin. Alternatively, the mice were given a daily 10 mg/kg acivicin dose per os in the drinking water assuming a daily intake of ∼5 ml of water. The levels of trypanosomes in the blood were followed by inspection of blood samples with a microscope with a detection limit of 0.1 million trypanosomes/ml. Acivicin plasma concentrations in mice were measured by adding 15 μl of plasma to paper filters (Oxoid) and placing them on Bacillus subtilis plated on complete synthetic medium plates (23Hanka L.J. Dietz A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1973; 3: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Zones of inhibition were measured after 15–18 h incubation at 37 °C. The concentration of the drug was estimated from standard curves by comparing the inhibition zones to those obtained by samples with known acivicin concentrations (23Hanka L.J. Dietz A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1973; 3: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 35McGovren J.P. Neil G.L. Chan P.J. Stewart J.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1981; 216: 433-440PubMed Google Scholar). Effects of Acivicin on Cultured Bloodstream T. brucei—T. brucei (TC221) parasites were propagated at 37 °C in 7% CO2 in a humified atmosphere in Hirumi′s modified Iscove′s medium-9 (36Hirumi H. Hirumi K. J. Parasitol. 1989; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar) containing 0.4 mm l-glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum. In a series of tubes, 2 ml of culture containing around 200,000 trypanosomes/ml were incubated with 1–5 μm acivicin for 72 or 96 h. Then the cells were collected by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 3 min, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and finally resuspended in fresh HMI-9 medium without drug. During the experiment, trypanosome levels were monitored by counting the cells in a microscope with a detection limit of 1000 cells/ml. Expression and Purification of Recombinant T. brucei CTPS—To avoid formation of inclusion bodies, the His-tagged CTPS was expressed without IPTG induction. Furthermore, the bacteria had to be grown at 15 °C to maximize the expression of the soluble form of the recombinant enzyme. The low expression levels of soluble protein required the use of metal affinity chromatography on a Co2+-bearing Sepharose medium called Talon resin. The second Talon chromatography step was preceded by the removal of imidazole on a Sephadex G-50 column and cleavage of the histidine tag by tobacco etch virus protease which recognizes a sequence consisting of seven amino acids, EXXYXQ↓(S/G) (37Dougherty W.G. Carrington J.C. Cary S.M. Parks T.D. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1281-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A shift in mobility of the T. brucei CTPS seen on the SDS-PAGE confirmed the successful proteolysis (Fig. 1). By loading the protein solution a second time onto the Talon resin, we removed the His-tagged TEV protease together with most of the impurities eluted from the first affinity step while we collected the purified CTPS in the flow-through fraction. As a final purification step, a strong anion exchanger, Source Q 15 Sepharose, was employed. Again, the flow-through fraction contained highly purified, recombinant CTPS leaving most of the impurities bound to the column (Fig. 1). During the purification, the specific activity of the enzyme preparation increased 836-fold and the total yield was 28% (Table 1).TABLE 1Purification of T. brucei CTP synthetase The enzyme was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data are based on 90 g of wet cells corresponding to 6 liters of bacterial culture.Total unitsProtein amountSpecific activityYieldPurificationnmol/minmgunits/mg%-foldCrude extract79212000.6610011st Talon eluate4293.6119.254.2181TEV-cleaved 2nd Talon flow-through2870.72398.636.2604Concentrated SourceQ flow-through2210.4551.527.9836 Open table in a new tab Enzyme Kinetics and Acivicin Inhibition—The specific activity of the pure enzyme was determined to 550 units/mg, a value, which is close to the specific activity of the highly purified rat liver enzyme assayed under similar conditions (38Thomas P.E. Lamb B.J. Chu E.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 953: 334-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In an attempt to explain the low CTP pools in trypanosomes, we examined the ligand Km values of the trypanosome CTPS (Table 2). Two striking differences between the published values of mammalian CTPS and the values of the trypanosome enzyme were observed. (i) The Km of the trypanosome enzyme for UTP is two times higher compared with the corresponding value for the mammalian CTPS (0.16 mm and 0.07 mm, respectively) (14Savage C.R. Weinfeld H. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2529-2535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) The Km of T. brucei CTPS for ATP is much lower than the corresponding value for the mammalian CTPS (0.07 mm compared with 0.91 mm). It appears as even though the velocity of the reaction is increased 7-fold when the trypanosome enzyme is saturated with ATP, the enzyme shows no absolute requirement for ATP when all the other four ligands are present at saturating concentrations. Most probably, ATP can be substituted against GTP, without which there is no reaction (Fig. 2).TABLE 2Km values of T. brucei and calf liver CTPSLigandT. brucei KmCalf liver KmaSee Ref. 14mmmmATP0.070.91UTP0.160.07GTP0.070.07l-glutamine0.260.21a See 14Savage C.R.

(31Neil G.L. Berger A.E. McPartland R.P. Grindey G.B. Bloch A. Cancer Res. 1979; 39: 852-856PubMed Google Scholar) to make the comparison to the mammalian CTPS as valid as possible. From the Dixon plot, where the inverted initial velocities were plotted as a function of acivicin concentration at a series of increasing glutamine concentrations, we could determine the Ki of the trypanosome CTPS for acivicin to 2.3 μm (Fig. 3). As observed for other glutamine amidotransferases (39Chittur S.V. Klem T.J. Shafer C.M. Davisson V.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 876-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the acivicin inhibition of T. brucei CTPS was more pronounced when the enzyme was preincubated with the drug in the presence of nucleotide substrates than in the absence of substrates (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Preincubation experiments with T. brucei CTPS, acivicin, and nucleotides.

In the case of trypanosome CTPS, we took advantage of the new GEMMA technique, which allows direct determination of the oligomeric forms of non-covalent protein complexes at the low concentration of protein used in the assay. From the GEMMA experiments, we could observe that at an enzyme concentration of 20 μg/ml, which is similar to the concentration in the activity assay, the dominating forms of the trypanosome CTPS in the absence of nucleotides were monomers and tetramers. The concentration of dimers was about half of the monomer or tetramer concentration (Fig. 5A). After the addition of 20 μm ATP or UTP alone or in combination, the balance strongly shifted toward the tetrameric form (Fig. 5, B–D) indicating that the active form of the trypanosome CTPS is a tetramer. Acivicin Treatment of Non-infected and T. brucei-infected Mice—From previously published data (31Neil G.L. Berger A.E. McPartland R.P. Grindey G.B. Bloch A.

On the other hand, a daily dose of 5 mg/kg (Fig. 6) or less (data not shown) did not cause any observable weight loss during the same period. In non-infected mice, the leukocyte count did not show any significant change after injection of 1 mg/kg for 12 days.

Thus, the proper control of the surface number of these proteins is essential for maintaining the structural and functional homeostasis of a cell. Internalization and recycling plays a key role in determining the surface density of receptors and channels. Whereas the clathrin-mediated internalization and its associated recycling have been the focus of research in this field, recent studies have revealed that an increasing number of receptors and channels enter a cell via clathrin-independent pathways. However, little is known about the trafficking motifs involved in controlling clathrin-independent internalization and various associated recycling pathways. By using a potassium channel as a model system, we identified a class of trafficking motifs that function along a clathrin-independent pathway to increase the surface density of a membrane protein by preventing its rapid internalization and/or facilitating its recycling via the ADP-ribosylation factor 6-dependent recycling pathway. Moreover our data suggest that these motifs may enhance the association of membrane proteins with the EFA6 family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors for ADP-ribosylation factor 6.

A cell needs to closely monitor and regulate the surface density of receptors and ion channels in its plasma membrane to maintain physiological homeostasis, sense environmental changes, and communicate with other cells. Failing to do so often causes serious consequences; for example, Bartter syndrome (a hypertension disorder), Andersen disease (a muscle disorder), or hyperinsulinism may be caused by mutations affecting the surface delivery of inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) 2The abbreviations used are: Kir, inwardly rectifying potassium; Arf, ADP-ribosylation factor; mAChR, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; KAC, potassium channel acidic clusters; TGN, trans-Golgi network; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; Fcd, Furin cytoplasmic domain; FAC, Furin acidic cluster; EFA, exchange factor for Arf6. 2The abbreviations used are: Kir, inwardly rectifying potassium; Arf, ADP-ribosylation factor; mAChR, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; KAC, potassium channel acidic clusters; TGN, trans-Golgi network; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; Fcd, Furin cytoplasmic domain; FAC, Furin acidic cluster; EFA, exchange factor for Arf6. channel Kir1.1 (1Peters M.

Because internalization and recycling regulate the surface density of receptors and channels, they play crucial roles in the function of these proteins. The clathrin-dependent internalization pathway has been the focus of research in this field because it is mediated by specific trafficking motifs located within cargo proteins and thus allows a cell to selectively control its surface level of particular receptors and channels. Known motifs for clathrin-mediated internalization include the tyrosine-based motif, dileucine-based motif, NPXY(X is any amino acid), and monoubiquitination (3Mousavi S.A. Malerod L. Berg T. Kjeken R. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Identification and characterization of these motifs have greatly facilitated our understanding of clathrin-mediated internalization. In contrast, no such trafficking motifs have been identified for clathrin-independent internalization pathways, and much less is known about these trafficking events. Given that clathrin-independent internalization can account for as much as 50% of the total endocytic activity in a cell (4Sandvig K. van Deurs B. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1991; 15: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and an increasing number of membrane proteins are reported to be internalized independently of clathrin (5Kirkham M. Parton R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1745: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), our lack of knowledge of its mechanism and regulation represents a major gap in efforts to understand how a cell regulates the level of receptors and channels on its surface. Most studies on recycling have been carried out on proteins internalized via the clathrin-mediated internalization pathway (6Maxfield F.R. McGraw T.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). Once internalized, the nascent clathrin-coated vesicles shed their coats and undergo homotypic fusion before fusing with early endosomes. From early endosomes, internalized proteins are either recycled to the cell surface (directly via recycling endosomes or via the trans-Golgi network) or targeted to degradative lysosomes via late endosomes (6Maxfield F.R. McGraw T.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). A small GTPase of the Rab subfamily, Rab5, mediates the formation of clathrincoated vesicles, the fusion between internalized vesicles and early endosomes, the fusion among early endosomes, and endosomal cargo recruitment and endosomal motility (7Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2706) Google Scholar, 8Somsel Rodman J. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 183-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Over-expression of the GTPase-defective Q79L mutant of Rab5 increases clathrin-mediated internalization, decreases the exit of internalized proteins from early endosomes (9Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar), and promotes the homotypic fusion of early endosomes (10Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). As a consequence, proteins internalized via the clathrin-mediated pathway are accumulated in the early endosomes in the presence of this mutant, which eventually leads to the formation of giant endosomal structures. Recently Arf6, one member of the Arf subfamily of small GTPases, has been shown to regulate a non-conventional recycling pathway (11Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Since its discovery, many cargo proteins have been identified, including the major histocompatibility complex class I protein, the interleukin-2 receptor α subunit (11Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), integrins (12Brown F.D. Rozelle A.L. Yin H.L. Balla T. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1007-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), E-cadherin (13Paterson A.D. Parton R.G. Ferguson C. Stow J.L. Yap A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21050-21057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2 mAChR) (14Delaney K.A. Murph M.M. Brown L.M. Radhakrishna H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33439-33446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In cell types such as HeLa and COS-7 cells, the cargo proteins entering the Arf6 recycling pathway are internalized by a clathrin-independent mechanism (12Brown F.D. Rozelle A.L. Yin H.L. Balla T. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1007-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 14Delaney K.A. Murph M.M. Brown L.M. Radhakrishna H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33439-33446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). After internalization, these proteins are first transported to an intracellular Arf6-positive compartment that is distinct from the classical Rab5-positive early endosomes. From there, internalized proteins can be either directly recycled to the cell surface (11Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 12Brown F.D. Rozelle A.L. Yin H.L. Balla T. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1007-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) or redirected to the Rab5-positive sorting endosomes (14Delaney K.A. Murph M.M. Brown L.M. Radhakrishna H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33439-33446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15Naslavsky N. Weigert R. Donaldson J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 417-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 16Naslavsky N. Weigert R. Donaldson J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3542-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Expression of the GTPase-defective Arf6Q67L mutant blocks the exit of cargo proteins from the Arf6 compartment and results in their intracellular accumulation in clusters of vacuoles (12Brown F.D. Rozelle A.L. Yin H.L. Balla T. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1007-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Direct surface recycling occurs via an array of tubules extending from the juxtanuclear region to the plasma membrane. Both Arf6 and EHD1, an Eps15 homology domaincontaining protein, are found to be associated with these recycling tubules, and overexpression of EHD1 induces tubular formation and enhances Arf6-mediated recycling (17Caplan S. Naslavsky N. Hartnell L.M. Lodge R. Polishchuk R.S. Donaldson J.G. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2557-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). With an increasingly growing list of cargo proteins, the Arf6 recycling pathway is likely to emerge as an important player in controlling the surface density of receptors and channels. DNA Constructs and Molecular Cloning—Plasmids pcDNA3-Kir3.4 and pcDNA3-Kir3.4ΔKAC have been described previously (18Ma D. Zerangue N. Raab-Graham K. Fried S.R. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2002; 33: 715-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). For Kir3.4 constructs containing an extracellular hemagglutinin (HA) epitope, YPYDVPDYA was inserted between amino acid residues 121 (Val) and 122 (Gly). For Kir3.4 constructs containing a C-terminal HA epitope, YPY-DVPDYA was fused to the C terminus of channel protein. Vectors pcDNA3-HA, pcDNA3-4FACHA, pcDNA3-4EXHA, and pcDNA3-4EEHA were constructed by inserting an HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA), four copies of FAC motif (SDSEED-EGRG) plus an HA epitope, four copies of EX motif (AEAEKE-AEAEHD) plus an HA epitope, and four copies of EE motif (EHDEEEEPNG) plus an HA epitope into the NotI-EcoRV sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), respectively. CD4ΔC in pCR3.1, a gift from Dr. M. von Zastrow, contains the extracellular region, transmembrane region, and 10 amino acids of the cytoplasmic region of CD4. The cytoplasmic Furin tail (RSGFSFRGVKVYTMDRGLISYKGLPPEAWQEECPSDSEEDEGRGERTAFIKDQSAL) was PCR-amplified and inserted at SmaI-NotI sites of pCR3.1 to generate CD4ΔCFcd. CD4ΔCFcd2A was then obtained by mutating SDSE to ADAE with a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Finally the coding region of CD4ΔCFcd2A was amplified by PCR and cloned into the HindIII-NotI sites of pcDNA3-HA, pcDNA3-4FAC-HA, pcDNA3-4EX-HA, or pcDNA3-4EE-HA to generate pcDNA3-CD4ΔCFcd2A-HA, pcDNA3-CD4ΔCFcd2A-4FAC-HA, pcDNA3-CD4ΔCFcd2A-4EX-HA, and pcDNA3-CD4ΔCFcd2A-4EE-HA. Plasmids pGFPC2-Rab5 (or -Rab5Q79L) and pGFPN1-Arf6 (or -Arf6Q67L) were made from original constructs provided by Drs. C. Bucci and J. Donaldson, respectively. To generate HA-tagged TWIK1, the coding region of TWIK1 was PCR-amplified from a mouse brain cDNA library (Dr. D. Julius) and cloned into the pcDNA3 vector containing a C-terminal HA tag. The following constructs were kind gifts: FLAG-tagged EFA6A, the inactive mutant EFA6A(E246K), and EFA6C (Drs. H. Sakagami and J. Miyazaki); EFA6B and EFA6D (Dr. J. Donaldson); green fluorescent protein fusions of Eps15Δ95/295 and Eps15D3Δ2 (Drs. A. Dautry-Varsat and A. Benmerah); Myc-tagged AP180C (Dr. H. McMahon); and HA-tagged mACHR5 (UMR cDNA Resource Center). Antibodies and Reagents—The primary antibodies used include mouse monoclonal anti-HA (HA.11, Covance), mouse monoclonal anti-CD4 (MAB1779, Chemicon), and mouse anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) antibodies. Fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes or Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Biotin-XX-conjugated transferrin and dextran conjugate (molecular mass, 70 kDa; lysine-fixable) was obtained from Molecular Probes. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, chelerythrine, amiloride, and wort-mannin were purchased from Calbiochem. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 or HeLa cells were cultured in Advanced Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1× penicillin-streptomycin (Cellgro). HL-1 cells were cultured in Claycomb medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm norepinephrine (Sigma), 2 mm glutamine, and 1× penicillin-streptomycin. Tissue culture flasks or coverslips used for growing HL-1 cells were coated with gelatin/fibronectin overnight in a 37 °C incubator before use. FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for transfecting cells as needed. Quantitative Surface Chemiluminescence—A detailed protocol for performing surface chemiluminescence measurement has been described previously (19Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). In brief, COS-7 cells were grown on 35-mm dishes until reaching a density of ∼70-80% confluence and transfected with 1 μg of total DNA/dish. 24 h later, surface proteins containing an extracellular HA epitope or the extracellular domain of CD4 were labeled by primary antibodies against HA (0.1 μg/ml) or CD4 (0.1 μg/ml) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) at the non-permeabilized conditions. Surface-bound horseradish peroxidase then oxidizes a chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal ELISA Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate, Pierce) and generates the chemiluminescence that can be measured using a quantitative luminometer (TD-20/20, Turner Design) at the following settings: sensitivity, 23.1; delay, 10 s; integration, 15 s. Internalization Assay—Cells transfected with HA-tagged or CD4-fused proteins were blocked (in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% normal goat serum, 1 h) and incubated with anti-HA or anti-CD4 antibodies (0.1 μg/ml in PBS containing 2% goat serum, 1 h) at 0 °C to label the surface proteins. After removing the unbound antibodies by PBS wash at 0 °C (three times for 5 min each), cells were transferred into prewarmed culture medium and returned to 37 °C to allow internalization to proceed for the indicated periods of time before immunofluorescence study. Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown on the 12-mm round glass coverslips (Warner Instruments) and transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). After 24-48 h, transfected cells were fixed (in PBS containing 4% formaldehyde, 20 min), permeabilized (in PBS containing 0.1% saponin, 15 min), blocked (in PBS Casein Blocker (Pierce) supplemented with 5% goat serum and 0.1% saponin, 30 min), incubated with primary antibody (0.1 μg/ml in blocking buffer, 1 h), washed (in PBS, three times for 5 min each), incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200 dilution in blocking buffer, 1 h), and washed (in PBS, three times for 5 min each). In case the labeling of nucleus was also needed, cells were further stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (0.1 μg/ml in PBS, 10 min) and washed (in PBS, two times for 5 min each). Coverslips were then allowed to air dry in the dark, mounted, and examined with an Olympus IX81 microscope. Immunoprecipitation—24 h after transfection, COS-7 were solubilized in ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40 complemented with Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and cleared by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitates were collected by a brief centrifugation after incubating the supernatant with 5 μg/ml mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody for 1 h (Covance) followed by protein G-Sepharose (Invitrogen) for 2 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were washed four times in ice-cold lysis buffer and once with PBS, and the bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 55 °C for 1 h or 90 °C for 10 min. GST Pulldown—Four copies of EX or EE motifs were PCR-amplified using pcDNA3-4EXHA or pcDNA3-4EEHA as templates and cloned into pGEX4T2 (GE Healthcare). The plasmids pGEX4T2-4EX and pGEX4T2-4EE were utilized to transform an Escherichia coli strain BL21 for expressing the corresponding GST-KAC fusion proteins. Purification of GST fusion proteins bound to resins was carried out using a GST-Bind kit (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. COS-7 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged EFA6 plasmids and solubilized 24 h later in ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. After clearing the cell debris by centrifugation at 4 °C, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube containing appropriate GST fusion proteins prebound to resins. The mixture was then incubated with shaking at 4 °C for 2 h and briefly centrifuged. After removing the supernatant, the resin was washed four times with ice-cold GST bind/wash buffer (Novagen) and eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 55 °C for 1 h or 90 °C for 10 min. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (6-15% gradient gels, Bio-Rad) and transferred to Immobilon 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) using a Semi Dry Electroblotting System (Owl). Membranes were incubated with appropriate primary antibody for 1 h in a1:1 mixture of Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR) and PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20, washed with PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (three times for 5 min each), incubated with appropriate secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) for 1 h in a1:1 mixture of Odyssey blocking buffer and PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.01% SDS, washed first with PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (three times for 5 min each) followed by PBS for 5 min, and dried in the dark. Quantitation was performed on an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System. Our previous studies identified an acidic amino acid sequence (Fig. 1A) whose presence dramatically increases the surface density of one inwardly rectifying potassium channel, Kir3.4, in both COS-7 cells and primary hippocampal neurons (18Ma D. Zerangue N. Raab-Graham K. Fried S.R. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2002; 33: 715-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A similar sequence exists in another channel, Kir2.1, and its deletion also results in a lower surface level. Because these motifs are enriched in acidic residues, they are referred to as potassium channel acidic clusters (KAC) motifs in this study. Given that the function of KAC motifs is independent of cell type, we characterized these motifs further in either COS-7 or HeLa cells. The higher transfection efficiency and expression level of exogenous constructs in COS-7 cells is more suitable for conducting quantitative surface measurements. On the other hand, the lower expression level of transfected proteins in HeLa cells facilitates the imaging analysis. Two Types of KAC Motifs Exist to Promote the Surface Density of Kir3.4 Channel—Examination of the acidic sequence of Kir3.4 revealed two types of acidic motifs, one type containing acidic and non-acidic residues at alternating positions (EAEKEAEAEH, named EX motif), and the other composed of a string of acidic residues (DEEEE, named EE motif) (Fig. 1A). To explore whether there are multiple types of acidic clusters, we first asked whether both EX and EE motifs were required to maintain the surface expression of Kir3.4-HAM. Kir3.4-HAM contains an HA epitope inserted at its first extracellular loop, thus allowing us to measure its surface level using quantitative chemiluminescence (19Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Several previous studies using other Kir channels have shown that insertion of an epitope at a similar position does not alter the channel function (19Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 20Ma D. Zerangue N. Lin Y.F. Collins A. Yu M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 2001; 291: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Although Kir3.4 lacking both EX and EE motifs displayed a greatly reduced surface density, mutating each motif alone, either by substituting EAEKEAEAEH with EAAKAAAAEH or DEEEE with DAAAE, had little effect on the channel surface level in transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 1B). The Western blot analysis suggested that the reduced surface expression of the KAC-deleted channel was not due to a decreased protein level (Fig. 1C). Our data suggest that either EX or EE motif can promote the surface expression of Kir3.4 by affecting its trafficking. KAC Motifs Are Sufficient to Increase the Surface Level of a Trafficking Reporter—A bona fide trafficking motif is expected to confer a trafficking phenotype in a manner that is not strictly dependent on its context. To determine whether this is the case for KAC motifs, we fused the EX or EE motif to an unrelated trafficking receptor, CD4ΔCFcd2A. CD4ΔCFcd2A was derived from CD4ΔC (provided by Dr. M. von Zastrow), which contains the extracellular region, transmembrane region, and 10 amino acids of the cytoplasmic region of CD4. As a consequence, CD4ΔC lacks any specific intracellular trafficking motifs and is efficiently localized to the cell surface when expressed alone in HeLa cells (Fig. 2B). We then fused the mutated cytoplasmic domain of Furin, Fcd2A, to CD4ΔC to generate CD4ΔCFcd2A. The cytoplasmic domain of Furin has two clathrin-mediated internalization signals (YKGL and LI) and one acidic signal mediating the endosome-to-TGN retrieval of internalized proteins (21Wan L. Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Rybak S.L. Thomas G. Cell. 1998; 94: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 22Crump C.M. Xiang Y. Thomas L. Gu F. Austin C. Tooze S.A. Thomas G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2191-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As a consequence, CD4ΔCFcd primarily resided at the TGN in transfected cells (Fig. 2B). When the endosome-to-TGN retrieval signal was inactivated by mutating two Ser residues to Ala in CD4ΔCFcd2A (23Dittie A.S. Thomas L. Thomas G. Tooze S.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4859-4870Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the fusion protein was still internalized but localized to both endosomes and the TGN presumably due to inefficient retrieval from endosomes to the TGN (Fig. 2B) (21Wan L. Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Rybak S.L. Thomas G. Cell. 1998; 94: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 22Crump C.M. Xiang Y. Thomas L. Gu F. Austin C. Tooze S.A. Thomas G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2191-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Given the endosomal localization of CD4ΔCFcd2A, we figured it may be used as a trafficking reporter to study the effects of EX or EE motif on internalization and recycling. We first fused one copy of EX or EE motif to the reporter CD4ΔCFcd2A and examined the trafficking of either fusion protein in transfected HeLa cells. Analysis of more than 1500 transfected cells in three separate experiments showed that fusion of either motif resulted in an increased fraction of transfected cells exhibiting robust surface localization of the reporter (Fig. 3A, n > 1500). Fusing four copies of either EX or EE further enhanced the efficiency of each trafficking motif in stimulating surface expression (Fig. 3A, n > 1500). Compared with CD4ΔCFcd2A, both CD4ΔCFcd2A-4EX and CD4ΔCFcd2A-4EE displayed greatly elevated surface staining in more than 80% of transfected cells (Fig. 3B). Similar observations were made in transfected primary hippocampal neurons (Fig. 3C, n > 100). Thus, the presence of KAC motifs can enhance the surface expression of an unrelated membrane protein (i.e. CD4ΔCFcd2A), and these motifs function as bona fide trafficking signals. KAC Motifs Increase the Surface Level of Membrane Proteins by Inhibiting Rapid Internalization and/or Facilitating Recycling—We next set out to determine which trafficking pathway or pathways may be controlled by KAC motifs. The observation that KAC motifs increased the surface density of CD4ΔCFcd2A implied that it might function along the endocytic pathway. To explore this possibility further, we first transfected COS-7 cells with Kir3.4-HAM or KAC-deleted Kir3.4-HAM and labeled the surface channels using an anti-HA antibody at 0 °C (to block internalization during labeling) followed by warming the cells to 37 °C to allow the internalization to proceed for various periods of time. As shown in Fig. 4A, after warming to 37 °C, KAC-deleted channel was rapidly concentrated into vesicles within 15 min in about 40% of transfected cells (n > 200). These vesicles were endosomes because they could only be labeled under detergent-permeabilized conditions (data not shown), and they were often enriched near the perinuclear region after a prolonged period (Fig. 4A, t = 30 min). In contrast, few or no intracellular vesicles were detected for the wild-type channel during the same period (Fig. 4B, n > 200). Importantly fusion of EX or EE to CD4ΔCFcd2A also led to a reduced accumulation of fusion proteins in transferrin-positive internalized vesicles (Fig. 4C). Thus, KAC motifs either inhibit internalization on the plasma membrane and/or facilitate the endosome-to-surface recycling. Surface Proteins Containing KAC Motifs Preferentially Enter the Arf6 Recycling Pathway via a Clathrin-independent Internalization Pathway—The above result established a role of KAC motifs in internalization or recycling of surface proteins, but it did not address the nature of internalization and recycling pathways utilized by proteins carrying these motifs. Although most internalized membrane proteins are first transported to the Rab5-positive early endosomes (9Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar), several proteins internalized independently of clathrin may bypass this conventional route and be targeted to the Arf6 compartment (12Brown F.D. Rozelle A.L. Yin H.L. Balla T. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1007-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). To dissect the trafficking pathway of internalized Kir3.4 and its KAC-deleted mutant, we investigated the subcellular localization of both channels in HeLa cells transfected by Rab5Q79L or Arf6Q67L, two GTPase-defective mutants that block the exit from the Rab5 early endosomes (9Bucci C.

https://openalex.org/W2088440909,"Abstract To study phosphorylation of the endogenous type I thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor in the anterior pituitary, we generated phosphosite-specific polyclonal antibodies. The major phosphorylation site of receptor endogenously expressed in pituitary GH3 cells was Thr365 in the receptor tail; distal sites were more phosphorylated in some heterologous models. β-Arrestin 2 reduced thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-stimulated inositol phosphate production and accelerated internalization of the wild type receptor but not receptor mutants where the critical phosphosites were mutated to Ala. Phosphorylation peaked within seconds and was maximal at 100 nm TRH. Based on dominant negative kinase and small interfering RNA approaches, phosphorylation was mediated primarily by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2. Phosphorylated receptor, visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy, was initially at the plasma membrane, and over 5-30 min it moved to intracellular vesicles in GH3 cells. Dephosphorylation was rapid (t½ ∼ 1 min) if agonist was removed while receptor was at the surface. Dephosphorylation was slower (t½ ∼ 4 min) if agonist was withdrawn after receptor had internalized. After agonist removal and dephosphorylation, a second pulse of agonist caused extensive rephosphorylation, particularly if most receptor was still on the plasma membrane. Phosphorylated receptor staining was visible in prolactin- and thyrotropin-producing cells in rat pituitary tissue from untreated rats and much stronger in tissue from animals injected with TRH. Our results show that the TRH receptor can rapidly cycle between a phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated state in response to changing agonist concentrations and that phosphorylation can be used as an indicator of receptor activity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2162366431,"The thiol-based redox regulation of proteins plays a central role in cellular signaling. Here, we investigated the redox regulation at the Zn2+ binding site (HX5CX20CC) in the intracellular T1-T1 inter-subunit interface of a Kv4 channel. This site undergoes conformational changes coupled to voltage-dependent gating, which may be sensitive to oxidative stress. The main results show that internally applied nitric oxide (NO) inhibits channel activity profoundly. This inhibition is reversed by reduced glutathione and suppressed by intracellular Zn2+, and at least two Zn2+ site cysteines are required to observe the NO-induced inhibition (Cys-110 from one subunit and Cys-132 from the neighboring subunit). Biochemical evidence suggests strongly that NO induces a disulfide bridge between Cys-110 and Cys-132 in intact cells. Finally, further mutational studies suggest that intra-subunit Zn2+ coordination involving His-104, Cys-131, and Cys-132 protects against the formation of the inhibitory disulfide bond. We propose that the interfacial T1 Zn2+ site of Kv4 channels acts as a Zn2+-dependent redox switch that may regulate the activity of neuronal and cardiac A-type K+ currents under physiological and pathological conditions. The thiol-based redox regulation of proteins plays a central role in cellular signaling. Here, we investigated the redox regulation at the Zn2+ binding site (HX5CX20CC) in the intracellular T1-T1 inter-subunit interface of a Kv4 channel. This site undergoes conformational changes coupled to voltage-dependent gating, which may be sensitive to oxidative stress.

This inhibition is reversed by reduced glutathione and suppressed by intracellular Zn2+, and at least two Zn2+ site cysteines are required to observe the NO-induced inhibition (Cys-110 from one subunit and Cys-132 from the neighboring subunit). Biochemical evidence suggests strongly that NO induces a disulfide bridge between Cys-110 and Cys-132 in intact cells. Finally, further mutational studies suggest that intra-subunit Zn2+ coordination involving His-104, Cys-131, and Cys-132 protects against the formation of the inhibitory disulfide bond. We propose that the interfacial T1 Zn2+ site of Kv4 channels acts as a Zn2+-dependent redox switch that may regulate the activity of neuronal and cardiac A-type K+ currents under physiological and pathological conditions. The highly conserved inter-subunit Zn2+ binding motif (HX5CX20CC) in the intracellular T1 domain differentiates voltage-gated K+ channels such as Kv2, Kv3, and Kv4 from the Shaker Kv1 channels (1Bixby K.A.

Zn2+ is coordinated by a cysteine from one subunit and a histidine along with two cysteines from the neighboring subunit (Fig. 1). In the absence of β-subunits, Zn2+ binding to the T1 site in non-Shaker K+ channels is thought to stabilize the tetrameric structure of the channels (3Strang C. Kunjilwar K. DeRubeis D. Peterson D.

(Kv4-specific β-subunit) overrides the essential role of Zn2+ binding in subunit assembly (5Wang G. Shahidullah M. Rocha C.A. Strang C. Pfaffinger P.J. Covarrubias M. J. Gen.

Chem. 2004; 279: 54542-54551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas KChIP1 binds to the Kv4-T1 domain without altering the structure of the Zn2+ site and the T1-T1 interface (7Pioletti M. Findeisen F. Hura G.L. Minor Jr., D.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 8Wang H. Yan Y. Liu Q. Huang Y. Shen Y. Chen L. Chen Y. Yang Q. Hao Q. Wang K. Chai J. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutant Kv4 channels lacking the Zn2+ site retain nearly normal gating when co-expressed with auxiliary subunits KChIP1 and DPPX-S (5Wang G. Shahidullah M. Rocha C.A. Strang C. Pfaffinger P.J. Covarrubias M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and our previous studies showed that the cysteines in the Kv4-T1 Zn2+ site are unexpectedly accessible to thiol-specific reagents and that the T1-T1 interface at this location is dynamic and functionally coupled to voltage-dependent gating (5Wang G. Shahidullah M. Rocha C.A. Strang C. Pfaffinger P.J. Covarrubias M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 9Wang G. Covarrubias M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that this interface is not the gate that opens the channel, rearrangements in and around the interfacial Zn2+ site may regulate the conformational changes required for the opening of the intracellular activation gate (9Wang G. Covarrubias M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This scenario is structurally plausible because just above the Zn2+ site, the T1 domain is linked to the voltage-sensing domain via the T1-S1 linker, and the C-terminal cytoplasmic region immediately distal to the S6-tail, which may serve as the actual activation gate, may also interact with the T1-T1 interface (10Long S.B. Campbell E.B. MacKinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (1826) Google Scholar). The intriguing conservation of an apparently nonessential Zn2+ binding site at this gating regulatory domain suggests that it may play a signaling function rather than a purely structural role. In support of this hypothesis, reactive cysteines involved in Zn2+ binding in proteins are often identified as critical components in redox signaling (11Maret W. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2006; 8: 1419-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 12Paget M.S. Buttner M.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 91-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 13Hao Q. Maret W. J.

Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 474-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we asked the following questions: 1) Is the T1 Zn2+ site a target of nitrosative and oxidative regulation? 2) Are the Zn2+ coordinating residues in the T1 domain responsible for the redox regulation? 3) What is the role of Zn2+? 4) What interactions are involved and what is the mechanism of the regulation? To answer these questions, we investigated the modulation of a heterologously expressed Kv4.1 channel by nitric oxide (NO) and intracellular Zn2+ and the underlying molecular mechanism. This modulation is significant, because many studies support the physiologically relevant relationship between NO and Zn2+ homeostasis in excitable tissues (12Paget M.S. Buttner M.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 91-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 14Lipton S.A. Choi Y.B. Takahashi H. Zhang D. Li W. Godzik A. Bankston L.A.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained unsolved. This study strongly suggests that the functionally active T1-T1 intersubunit interface of Kv4 channels is a Zn2+-dependent redox switch, which may play a central modulatory role in excitable tissues.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and Reagents—H2O2 (30% w/v), dl-dithiothreitol (DTT), CuSO4, ZnCl2, 1,10-o-phenanthroline, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), and GSH were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Corp. 1,10-o-Phenanthroline was solubilized in ethanol. (Z)-1-(N-Methyl-N-[6-(N-methylammoniohexyl)amino]) diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (MAHMA-NONOate) and sodium 2-(N,N-dimethylamino)diazenolate-2-oxide (DEA-NONOate) were purchased from Axxora Biosciences, San Diego, CA. Methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents (2-trimethylammonium ethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET), 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA), and methylmethanethiolsulfonate (MMTS)) were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, Ontario, Canada) and stored in a desiccator at -20 °C. Tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl ethylenediamide) (TPEN) was purchased from Molecular Devices (Eugene, OR). As reported by the manufacturer, TPEN has an apparent binding affinity for Zn2+ of the order of 3 × 10-16 m. All working solutions of DTT, GSH, 1,10-o-phenanthroline, MAHMA-NONOate, SNAP, DEA-NONOate, and MTS reagents were made just before use.Molecular Biology and Heterologous Expression—Kv4.1 (mouse) and DPPX-S were maintained in pBluescript II KS and pSG5 (Stratagene), respectively. KChIP1 was maintained in a modified pBluescript vector, pBJ/KSM. KChIP1 and DPPX-S are gifts from M. Bowlby (Wyeth-Ayerst Research, Princeton, NJ) and B. Rudy (New York University, New York, NY), respectively. All mutants were produced by using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene and confirmed by automated sequencing (Nucleic Acid Facility of the Kimmel Cancer Institute, Thomas Jefferson University). The capped cRNAs for Xenopus oocyte expression were synthesized by using the in vitro transcription kit, Message Machine (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). For all the experiments, we coexpressed Kv4.1 WT and mutants with KChIP1 and DPPX-S. The expression of the Kv4.1 ternary complex was necessary because mutations in the putative Zn2+ site yielded non-functional channels or inhibited expression profoundly. Previous studies showed that the apparently lethal phenotype of Zn2+ site mutants can be corrected by co-expression of the channels with KChIPs (5Wang G. Shahidullah M. Rocha C.A. Strang C. Pfaffinger P.J. Covarrubias M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 6Kunjilwar K. Strang C. DeRubeis D. Pfaffinger P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54542-54551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and we have found that DPPX-S boosts the expression of the channels even further (5Wang G. Shahidullah M. Rocha C.A. Strang C. Pfaffinger P.J. Covarrubias M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), which made possible the recordings from inside-out macropatches.Electrophysiology—Inside-out patch clamp recordings were made using an asymmetrical KCl solution. Patch electrodes contained (mm) 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5 Hepes (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH), and the bath solution consisted of (mm) 98 KCl, 0.5 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES (pH 7.2, adjusted with KOH). The internal solution containing ZnCl2 had no EGTA. Passive leak and capacitive transients from macropatch currents were subtracted on-line by using a P/4 procedure. The currents were filtered at 1.5-5 kHz. All the experiments were carried out at room temperature (22 ± 1 °C), and reagents were applied to the intracellular side of the patches. MAHMA-NONOate and DEA-NONOate were prepared just after forming the inside-out patch and establishing a stable current level. The powder was promptly solubilized in 10 mm NaOH at 100 mm. Several doses of stock solution were immediately stored below -70 °C. The final working solution at 0.1 mm was applied to the intracellular side of the channel. At room temperature, these two reagents generate 2NO with a half-life of ∼3 min and ∼15 min at pH 7.4, respectively (23Fitzhugh A.L. Keefer L.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1463-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For disulfide cross-linking experiments, we used a mild oxidizing solution containing 50 μm CuSO4 and 200 μm 1,10-o-phenanthroline (Cu/P) (24Liu Y. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. Neuron. 1996; 16: 859-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). To promote the formation of the disulfide bond between a cysteine pair in the T1-T1 interface, the cytoplasmic side of the inside-out patches was treated for ∼5 min with fresh Cu/P. After Cu/P washout, 20 mm DTT was used to reduce the disulfide bond (5Wang G. Shahidullah M. Rocha C.A. Strang C. Pfaffinger P.J. Covarrubias M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), or 400 μm MTSET was employed to test for the presence of free thiolate groups.Protein Biochemistry—The Kv4.2-T1 domain with a poly-His tag at the N terminus was expressed in bacteria and purified by a standard Ni2+ column protocol as described previously (4Jahng A.W. Strang C. Kaiser D. Pollard T. Pfaffinger P. Choe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47885-47890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The T1 protein was in a Tris-buffered saline solution of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl. The protein was incubated with 2 mm GSH for at least ∼20 min at room temperature. After reaction with GSH, the sample was prepared either for atomic absorption measurements or for fast protein liquid chromatography analysis as described previously (3Strang C. Kunjilwar K. DeRubeis D. Peterson D. Pfaffinger P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31361-31371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Atomic absorption spectroscopy was performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences AAAnalyzer 600 in the Chemistry Department of Rice University (Houston, TX). Zn2+ absorption was read at 213.9 nm with a slit width set at 0.7 nm. Commercially available Zn2+ standards to quantify the Zn2+ content in dilute nitric acid were used to make a standard curve. Spiked Zn2+ standards in the phosphate-buffered saline background were also prepared to calibrate the standard curve for the protein samples. No difference was found between the diluted nitric acid and the phosphate-buffered protein background matrix. Protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm and corrected for light scattering, if necessary, with an extinction coefficient of 1 A280 unit per ml/mg of protein.To confirm the formation of the disulfide bond across the T1-T1 interface, T293 cells were grown in 6-well plates (35-mm wells) in Opti-MEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells at ∼70% confluence were transfected with cytomegalovirus promoter plasmids for Kv4.1 constructs plus KChIP3 and enhanced green fluorescent protein (1 μg:1 μg:0.5 μg) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were placed in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline with divalents (Invitrogen) at room temperature. For NO treatment, 1 ml of Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline solution with 1 mm MAHMA-NONOate was added twice to the bath for 10 min each. The solution was removed, and cells were solubilized in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer. Half of each sample was treated with 200 mm DTT prior to running on a 6% SDS-PAGE gel. Gels were transferred to Immobilon (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and Western blotted with anti-Kv4.1 (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel) at 1:400 and detected with goat anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) at 1:5000. Exposures were 10 s in Pico ECL (Pierce) on BIOMAX MR film (Kodak, New Haven, CT).Data Acquisition and Analysis—Voltage clamp protocols and data acquisition were controlled by a Pentium-4 class desktop computer interfaced to a 12-bit analog/digital converter (Digidata 1200) or a 16-bit analog/digital converter (Digidata 1322) and driven by Clampex 8.0 or 9.0 (Axon Instruments). Clampfit 8.0 or 9.0 (Axon Instruments) and Origin 7.0 (Origin Lab Inc.) were used for data reduction and analysis. The time courses of peak current inhibition were evaluated quantitatively by assuming exponential decays to estimate the time constants and fractional currents at steady state. Data from at least three patches for each measurement are presented as mean ± S.E. The one-way analysis of variance test was used to evaluate statistically significant differences between two groups of data.RESULTSZn2+ Site Cysteines Are Major Targets of Nitrosative Modulation in a Kv4 Channel Complex—Upon application of the fast NO donor MAHMA-NONOate (100 μm) to the cytoplasmic side of inside-out patches of Xenopus oocyte expressing the ternary wild-type (WT) Kv4 channel complex (Kv4.1+KChIP1+DPPX-S, see “Experimental Procedures”), the outward K+ currents were inhibited quickly and profoundly (Figs. 2, A-C, and 6). The time course of this inhibition was approximately exponential with the following best-fit rate constant (ko = 1/τ) and % inhibition at steady-state (I%): 0.040 ± 0.006 s-1 and 63 ± 4%, respectively. The inhibition was similarly fast (0.042 ± 0.001 s-1) but more profound (85 ± 2%) when all intracellular cysteines but the three in the T1 Zn2+ site (Cys-110, Cys-131, and Cys-132) were mutated to alanines in the C11xA mutant (Figs. 2, D-F, and 6). DEA-NONOate, a slower NO donor (see “Experimental Procedures”) produced a similar result (data not shown). In sharp contrast, the inhibition was greatly suppressed when the three Zn2+ site cysteines were mutated to alanines in the C3xA mutant (Figs. 2, G-I, and 6) or when all 14 internal cysteines were mutated to alanines in a C14xA mutant (“Cys-less”; Figs. 3, A and B, and 6). Both the ko and I% were reduced ∼3-fold relative to values from the C11xA mutant. The residual slow response may arise from nonspecific nitrosation or oxidation of non-cysteine residues (e.g. Met, Ser, and Tyr) in the Kv4 channel complex (25Hoshi T. Heinemann S. J. Physiol. 2001; 531: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), because gating of the C14xA mutant co-expressed with KChIP1 and DPPX-S was not affected by thiol-specific reagents (5Wang G. Shahidullah M. Rocha C.A. Strang C. Pfaffinger P.J. Covarrubias M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this study, this small and slow cysteine-independent response was not investigated further, and we regard it as background inhibition. The specific inhibition was not caused by a by-product of MAHMA-NONOate or DEA-NONOate decomposition upon NO release, because washout did not reverse it and application of the exhausted NO-donor had no effect on the Kv4 current (data not shown). Once released from its donor, NO is highly labile; therefore, internally applied H2O2, which is relatively stable, was also used in several experiments as a control reagent to verify the functional role of the cysteines in the T1 Zn2+ site. Under identical conditions, high concentrations of H2O2 yielded results that were qualitatively similar to those obtained with NO: the rate and degree of inhibition of the Kv4 channel complex depended sharply on the presence of cysteines in the T1 Zn2+ site (Fig. 3C, and see Fig. 6, and supplemental Fig. S1). Lower concentrations of H2O2 were also attempted; however, the slow rate to the inhibition under these conditions made these experiments generally impractical for quantitative analysis due to the limited life-time of the inside-out patches. The role of external cysteines in these responses is unlikely, because, in agreement with previous studies, the external application of H2O2 had no effect on the Kv4 current (Fig. 3C) (26Serodio P.

The former has two internal cysteines (Ala-110, Cys-131, and Cys-132) from one side of the interface (Fig. 3D), and the latter has one internal cysteine only (Cys-110, Ala-131, and Ala-132) from the other side of the interface (Fig. 3G). Thus, no disulfide bridges can be formed across the interface upon oxidation. Like mutants C13xA and C14xA, the C12xA-a mutant only exhibited a background response when MAHMA-NONOate or H2O2 were applied internally (Figs. 3, E and F, and 6); but the C13xA mutant, which carries Cys-110 only was inhibited rapidly and more severely by MAHMA-NONOate (ko = 0.025 ± 0.004 s-1 and I% = 70 ± 1%) or H2O2 (ko = 0.010 ± 0.001 s-1 and I% = 67 ± 4%) than C12xA-a (p < 0.005; Figs. 3, H and I, and 6). Any additional sensitivity of the C12xA-a mutant could not be uncovered even by chelating any possible protective Zn2+ with 20 μm TPEN, a high affinity Zn2+ chelator (Fig. 3F). These results suggest that Cys-110 plays a unique and critical role in redox modulation of the Kv4 channel complex. Supporting this conclusion, Cys-110 was protected by pre-forming a thiol-specific adduct with MMTS (a non-polar methanethiosulfonate reagent) in the C13xA mutant (see “Experimental Procedures”). This treatment reduced the subsequent responses to MAHMA-NONOate and H2O2 to levels that were close to background (Fig. 3, H and I).Combined Presence of Cys-110 and His-104 Is Sufficient to Observe Nitrosative Modulation of the Kv4 Channel Complex—The above findings were surprising, because modification of any cysteine in the Kv4.1-T1 Zn2+ site by MTSET induces profound inhibition of the channel, which may result from steric and/or electrostatic interactions in the T1-T1 interface (5Wang G. Shahidullah M. Rocha C.A. Strang C. Pfaffinger P.J. Covarrubias M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The selective inhibition of the C13xA mutant (Cys-110 only) by nitrosation and oxidation suggests that modification of any individual Zn2+ site cysteine is not always sufficient to produce the robust inhibition; therefore, it is necessary to consider more specific interactions that require a particular location and orientation of the groups involved. In the C13xA mutant, two Zn2+-coordinating residues, Cys-110 and His-104, are located in vicinal subunits across the T1-T1 interface (Fig. 4A). Although the thiol group (-SH) of Cys-110 cannot form a strong H-bond with His-104, Cys-110 that is oxidized by NO or H2O2 could provide a strong proton donor (S-NO or S-OH) or acceptor (S-NO, SO-2 or SO-3) to form an H-bond with the imidazole group of His-104, which is a strong proton donor or acceptor at physiological pH (28Ippolito J.A. Alexander R.S. Christianson D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 457-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Thus, mutation of either Cys-110 or His-104 to alanine should suppress the inhibition, because the non-polar side chain of alanine cannot serve as a strong proton donor or acceptor to form the H-bond (28Ippolito J.A. Alexander R.S. Christianson D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 457-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the mutants C14xA (Cys-less; His-104 is the sole Zn2+ ligand remaining) and C13xA-H104A (Cys-110 only) exhibited responses to NO or H2O2 that were indistinguishable from background (ko = 0.007-0.013 s-1 and I% = 27%; Figs. 4, C and D, and 6). Similar results were obtained with C13xA-H104Q and C13xA-H104L (data not shown).FIGURE 4The presence of Cys-110 and His-104 is sufficient to observe the inhibition of Kv4.1 channels by NO, H2O2, and MTSEA.

https://openalex.org/W2059174611,"Dps (DNA protection during starvation) proteins play an important role in the protection of prokaryotic macromolecules from damage by reactive oxygen species. Previous studies have suggested that the lysine-rich N-terminal tail of Dps proteins participates in DNA binding. In comparison with other Dps proteins, Dps-1 from Deinococcus radiodurans has an extended N terminus comprising 55 amino acids preceding the first helix of the 4-helix bundle monomer. In the crystal structure of Dps-1, the first ∼30 N-terminal residues are invisible, and the remaining 25 residues form a loop that harbors a novel metal-binding site. We show here that deletion of the flexible N-terminal tail obliterates DNA/Dps-1 interaction. Surprisingly, deletion of the entire N terminus also abolishes dodecameric assembly of the protein. Retention of the N-terminal metal site is necessary for formation of the dodecamer, and metal binding at this site facilitates oligomerization of the protein. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using DNA modified with specific major/minor groove reagents further show that Dps-1 interacts through the DNA major groove. DNA cyclization assays suggest that dodecameric Dps-1 does not wrap DNA about itself. A significant decrease in DNA binding affinity accompanies a reduction in duplex length from 22 to 18 bp, but only for dodecameric Dps-1. Our data further suggest that high affinity DNA binding depends on occupancy of the N-terminal metal site. Taken together, the mode of DNA interaction by dodecameric Dps-1 suggests interaction of two metal-anchored N-terminal tails in successive DNA major grooves, leading to DNA compaction by formation of stacked protein-DNA layers.

All aerobic microorganisms are exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS) 2The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; Dps, DNA protection during starvation; Dps-dn, Dps-1 deleted for its N-terminal extension; Dps-met, N-terminally truncated Dps-1 retaining the metal site; TBP, TATA box-binding protein; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; TBE, Tris borate-EDTA. such as O2.¯, and ·OH that can damage cellular macromolecules, including proteins, lipids, and DNA. Therefore, they have developed a number of defense mechanisms to combat such stress conditions in the environment. One of the key components in the response to oxidative stress in prokaryotes is the nonspecific DNA-binding protein Dps (DNA protection during starvation). Toxicity of the ROS H2O2 itself is relatively weak, but it can form highly reactive hydroxyl radicals in the presence of transition metals such as Fe2+ according to the Fenton reaction (H2O2 + Fe2+ →·OH + -OH + Fe3+) (1Crichton R.R. Wilmet S. Legssyer R. Ward R.J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of iron increases the probability of oxidative damage to cellular components. Dps, initially studied in Escherichia coli, was shown to protect DNA by its ability to chelate ferrous iron and also by its physical association with DNA (2Almiron M. Link A.J. Furlong D. Kolter R.

Twelve Dps monomers form a spherical assembly similar to the spherical shell formed by 24 subunits of the iron storage protein, ferritin (6Boyd D. Vecoli C. Belcher D.M. Jain S.K. Drysdale J.W. J.

Each Dps monomer adopts a four-helix (A–D) bundle conformation as seen for ferritin, but unlike ferritin, Dps possesses a short helix in the middle of the BC loop and lacks the C-terminal fifth helix present in the ferritin monomer (10Bozzi M.

Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Secondly, the ferroxidase site in Dps is usually generated at the interface between two subunits and, with one reported exception, is not within the four-helix bundle as in the case of ferritin (14Ilari A. Stefanini S. Chiancone E. Tsernoglou D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 15Gauss G.H. Benas P. Wiedenheft B. Young M. Douglas T. Lawrence C.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10815-10827Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is also notable that not all Dps homologs follow the same catalytic mechanism, as exemplified by the absence of a conserved ferroxidase center in Lactococcus lactis DpsB and the failure of Bacillus anthracis Dps1 to utilize H2O2 in the ferroxidation reaction (16Stillman T.J. Upadhyay M. Norte V.A. Sedelnikova S.E. Carradus M. Tzokov S. Bullough P.A. Shearman C.A. Gasson M.J. Williams C.H. Artymiuk P.J. Green J. Mol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 27827-27835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast to the highly conserved ferroxidase center, Dps homologs have a variable N-terminal extension. This N-terminal tail, which contains multiple positively charged residues, extends from the four-helix bundle core into the solvent (11Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 18Kim S.G. Bhattacharyya G. Grove A. Lee Y.H. J. Mol.

Because the surface of the Dps protein does not display “classical” DNA binding motifs and is dominated by negative charges, it has been proposed that the DNA binding properties of E. coli Dps, the family prototype, are associated with the presence of the lysine-rich N-terminal tail (11Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, proteins that do not have an N-terminal extension such as the Dps homolog Hp-NAP from Helicobacter pylori or Dps from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, whose N-terminal tail is immobilized on the protein surface, fail to bind DNA (20Ceci P. Ilari A. Falvo E. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20319-20326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 21Tonello F. Dundon W.G. Satin B. Molinari M. Tognon G. Grandi G. Del Giudice G. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The mesophilic, non-spore-forming eubacterium Deinococcus radiodurans is known for its extraordinary ability to withstand the lethal and mutagenic effects of DNA damaging agents, such as ionizing radiation and desiccation, both conditions that are characterized by the presence of oxidative radicals (22Battista J.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 203-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 23Wilson III, D.M. Sofinowski T.M. McNeill D.R. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: 963-981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). D. radiodurans encodes two proteins that are predicted to belong to the Dps family of proteins. The Dps homolog most closely related to E. coli Dps (Dps-1, the product of locus DR2263) is encoded on chromosome 1. Recently it was shown that both dodecameric and dimeric forms of Dps-1 can bind DNA and that both exhibit ferroxidase activity (24Grove A. Wilkinson S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Notably, the dodecameric Dps-1 is functionally distinct from other Dps homologs because of its inability to provide efficient protection against hydroxyl radical-mediated DNA degradation. The N-terminal extension of Dps-1 is longer than that of E. coli Dps and contains a total of seven lysine residues. The recently solved crystal structure of D. radiodurans Dps-1 shows that the N terminus is exposed at the surface of the dodecamer and would be available to interact with DNA (18Kim S.G. Bhattacharyya G. Grove A. Lee Y.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19Romao C.V. Mitchell E.P. McSweeney S. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2006; 11: 891-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The first ∼30 amino acids of the N terminus are not visible in the structure and are presumably disordered. The crystal structure of Dps-1 also reveals a unique metal-binding site located at the base of the N-terminal tail, docking it to the outer surface of the protein. Only L. lactis Dps features a metal site at the N terminus; however, there is no structural similarity between L. lactis Dps and D. radiodurans Dps-1 in this region (16Stillman T.J. Upadhyay M. Norte V.A. Sedelnikova S.E. Carradus M. Tzokov S. Bullough P.A. Shearman C.A. Gasson M.J. Williams C.H. Artymiuk P.J. Green J. Mol.

Here we show that the N-terminal extension of Dps-1 surprisingly is required not only for DNA binding but also for assembly of the dodecamer. Analysis of DNA binding suggests a mode of interaction consistent with metal-anchored N-terminal extensions interacting in successive DNA major grooves. With multiple DNA binding sites, this mode of interaction is consistent with the previously observed DNA compaction, suggested to arise as a consequence of the formation of stacked layers of DNA and protein (25Frenkiel-Krispin D. Ben-Avraham I. Englander J. Shimoni E. Wolf S.G. Minsky A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis, Overexpression, and Purification of Dps-dn and Dps-met—Deletion of the entire N-terminal extension (Dps-dn) was accomplished by amplifying the Dps-1 gene lacking 165 bp at the N terminus from plasmid containing the entire Dps-1 gene (pET5a-dps1) using forward primer 5′-GAAAAAGAGCATATGACCGTC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTTCAAGAATTCCCCTTCTCC-3′. The amplified PCR fragment was then cloned into the T7-NT/TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Dps-1 retaining the N-terminal metal site was generated by amplification of the Dps-1 gene lacking 99 bp at the N terminus from pET5a-dps1 using forward primer 5′-GCGGCACCATGCACGCT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CGTCTTCAAGAATTCCCCTTCTC-3′. The PCR product was then re-amplified using forward primer 5′-CACCATGCACGCTGAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTTCAAGAATTCCCCTTCTCC-3′ to introduce the sequence necessary to clone it into the Champion pET100/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The integrity of the constructs was confirmed by sequencing. Each of the resulting plasmids was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, and overexpression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an A600 of 0.3. Cells were pelleted 2 h after induction and stored at -80 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer, pH 8.0 (50 mm NaxHyPO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and lysed by sonication. Nucleic acids were digested by the addition of DNase I followed by a 1-h incubation on ice. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 5000 rpm. The supernatant was mixed with 5 ml of HIS-Select nickel affinity gel (Sigma) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The mixture was then poured into a column and washed with 5 column volumes of wash buffer, pH 8.0 (50 mm NaxHyPO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Proteins were eluted with a 40-ml linear gradient from 20 mm imidazole (wash buffer) to 250 mm imidazole (elution buffer, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaxHyPO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by 50 ml of elution buffer. Pure Dps-dn and Dps-met fractions were pooled, and protein concentrations were determined by quantification of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Untagged full-length Dps-1 was prepared as described (24Grove A. Wilkinson S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All protein preparations were judged to be >95% pure based on Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels. Cleavage of the His Tag from Recombinant Dps-dn and Dps-met—Fifty μg of protein was incubated with 1 unit of recombinant enterokinase (rEK) from Novagen at room temperature for 16 h in rEK cleavage buffer (50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) supplied with the enzyme. The cleavage reactions were judged by SDS-PAGE to be complete. Protein Cross-linking—Proteins were cross-linked with 0.1% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in presence of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, and 50 or 500 mm NaCl in a total reaction volume of 10 μl at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer, and the cross-linked products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—The oligomeric state of wild type Dps-1 and the N-terminal deletion mutants was observed on 5% non-denaturing acrylamide gels. The gel recipe was the same as the running gel of SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli, excluding the presence of SDS. The electrophoresis was carried out in 375 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.7. FPLC and Gel Filtration—All steps of gel filtration were carried out at 4 °C. HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 30 prep grade column (bed length 60 cm, inner diameter 16 mm; GE Healthcare) was first washed with 1 column volume of buffer A, pH 8.0 (50 mm NaxHyPO4, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol) and then with 2 column volumes of buffer B, pH 8.0 (50 mm NaxHyPO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol). The gel filtration standard (Bio-Rad), which is a mixture of bovine thyroglobin (670 kDa), bovine γ-globulin (158kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44kDa), horse myoglobin (17kDa), and vitamin B-12 (1.35kDa), was run to calibrate the column. The concentration of protein applied to the gel filtration column was 5 mg/ml for both wild type Dps-1 and Dps-dn. The proteins were run independently under the same conditions and were eluted with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Ferroxidation by Dps-dn and Dps-met—The kinetics of iron oxidation by Dps-dn and Dps-met was measured at 310 nm using an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer. Proteins were diluted to 0.2 mg/ml in 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl. Solutions of ferrous ammonium sulfate, which were used as the source of ferrous iron, were freshly prepared immediately before each experiment. The kinetic data were plotted using Prizm. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Supercoiled pGEM5 (100 ng corresponding to 52 fmol of plasmid) was mixed with protein in 10 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 or 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Brij58, 100 μg/ml of BSA) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The entire reaction was then loaded onto a 1% (w/v) agarose gel in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA). The gel was stained with ethidium bromide after electrophoresis. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides used to generate short duplex DNA constructs were purchased and purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The sequence of 26-, 22-, 18-, and 13-bp (all average G + C content) DNA is available as supplemental material. The top strand was 32P-labeled at the 5′-end with phage T4 polynucleotide kinase. Equimolar amounts of complementary oligonucleotides were mixed, heated to 90 °C, and cooled slowly to room temperature (23 °C) to form duplex DNA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using 10% polyacrylamide gels (39:1 (w/w) acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in 0.5× TBE unless specified otherwise. Gels were pre-run for 30 min at 175 volts at room temperature before loading the samples with the power on, except for experiments with 18- and 13-bp duplex, which were performed at 4 °C to ensure stability of the duplexes. DNA and protein were mixed in binding buffer (containing 50 mm NaCl for dimeric Dps-1 and 500 mm NaCl for dodecameric Dps-1), and each sample contained 50 fmol (for dimeric Dps-1) or 2.5 fmol (for dodecameric Dps-1) of DNA in a total reaction volume of 10 μl unless indicated otherwise. After electrophoresis, gels were dried, and protein-DNA complexes and free DNA were quantified by phosphorimaging using software supplied by the manufacturer (ImageQuant 1.1). The region on the gel between complex and free DNA was considered as a complex to account for complex dissociation during electrophoresis. Data were fit to the Hill equation, f = fmax[Dps-1]n/(Kd + [Dps-1])n), where [Dps-1] is the protein concentration, f is fractional saturation, Kd reflects the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant, and n is the Hill coefficient. Fits were performed using the program Kaleida-Graph, and the quality of the fits was evaluated by visual inspection, χ2 values, and correlation coefficients. All experiments were carried out at least in triplicate. Effect of Divalent Metal Ions on DNA Binding—To remove the divalent cations from Dps-1, the protein was incubated with 50 mm bipyridyl for 20 min at 4 °C. The bipyridyl or metal-bipyridyl complex was then removed from the protein solution by dialysis against a high salt buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm KCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 m β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C for 2 h. DNA (2.5 fmol) was then incubated with 0–12.4 nm bipyridyl treated protein with or without 80 nm CoCl2 (chosen as it is known from the crystal structure to bind the N-terminal metal site (18Kim S.G. Bhattacharyya G. Grove A. Lee Y.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)) at room temperature for 30 min. The reactions were analyzed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (39:1 (w/w) acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in 0.5× TBE. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried, and protein-DNA complexes and free DNA were visualized by phosphorimaging. Netropsin Assay—Eight nm dodecameric Dps-1 was incubated with 50 fmol of 26-bp double-stranded 32P-labeled DNA containing an 8-bp TATA box (the sequence available in the supplemental material) in 10 μl of binding buffer with 500 mm NaCl at room temperature for 45 min. Then the minor groove binding drug netropsin was added to the reaction to a final concentration of 1 μm for an additional 45-min incubation. The effect of netropsin on TATA box binding-protein (TBP)-DNA complex formation was studied in parallel where the same 26-bp duplex DNA was incubated with 1070 pmol of TBP in a reaction buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml BSA) followed by the addition of netropsin. All reactions were analyzed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (39:1 (w/w) acrylamide:bisacrylamide) containing 2.5 mm MgCl2 in 0.5× TBE with 2.5 mm MgCl2. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried, and protein-DNA complexes and free DNA were visualized by phosphorimaging. Methylation Interference Assay—26-bp 32P-labeled double-stranded DNA was methylated by treatment with 0.5% dimethyl sulfate (DMS) for 10 min at room temperature in a total reaction volume of 10 μl. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2.5 μl of DMS stop solution (1.5 m sodium acetate and 1 m β-mercaptoethanol), and the DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. 8 nm dodecameric Dps-1 was incubated with 50 fmol of 26-bp labeled duplex DNA treated with or without DMS in binding buffer containing 500 mm NaCl at room temperature for 60 min. The reactions were analyzed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (39:1 (w/w) acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in 0.5× TBE. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried, and protein-DNA complexes and free DNA were visualized by phosphorimaging. DNA Cyclization—Plasmid pET5a was digested with BspHI to yield a 105-bp fragment, which was purified on a 2% agarose gel. Ligase-mediated DNA cyclization experiments were carried out with varying protein concentrations. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 80 units of T4 DNA ligase to a final volume of 10 μl. Reactions containing 10–100 fmol of DNA and the desired concentration of Dps-1 or Thermotoga maritima HU were incubated in 1× binding buffer with 200 mm NaCl and 1× ligase buffer at room temperature for 60 min. Reactions were terminated using 3 μl of 10% SDS followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Reactions were analyzed on a 8% polyacrylamide gel (39:1 (w/w) acrylamide:bisacrylamide) with 0.5× TBE as running buffer. After electrophoresis, gels were dried, and ligation products were visualized by phosphorimaging. All experiments involving protein-DNA interaction or native gel electrophoresis were performed at least in triplicate and with at least two different protein preparations. Structural Considerations—A comparison of the Dps-1 amino acid sequence with that of other Dps proteins reveals that Dps-1 shares significant sequence homology with other Dps homologs, such as complete conservation of residues involved in assembly of the ferroxidase center, and that a main difference is the N-terminal extension (Fig. 1a). The crystal structure of Dps-1 contains ∼177 amino acid residues of each monomer; the first ∼30 residues are not visible, an indication that these residues are freely mobile and may be involved in DNA binding as in the case of E. coli Dps (11Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The remaining 25 N-terminal residues (Gly-31—Glu-55) preceding the first helix of the four-helix bundle define a loop that harbors a unique metal ion-binding site (Fig. 1b). To specify the role of the N terminus in DNA binding and state of oligomerization of Dps-1, two deletion mutants, Dps-dn and Dps-met, were constructed. Dps-dn lacks the entire 55-amino acid N terminus (thus, comprising residues 56–207), whereas Dps-met lacks only the 33-residue flexible N-terminal region (and comprises residues 34–207). Dps-dn and Dps-met were expressed with an N-terminal His6 tag, whereas wild type Dps-1 is untagged (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Purified proteins.

Wilkinson S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Indeed, the vast majority of recombinant Dps-1 isolated from E. coli is in the dodecameric state as shown by glutaraldehyde-mediated cross-linking (24Grove A. Wilkinson S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast, glutaraldehyde-mediated cross-linking of His6-tagged Dps-dn and Dps-met in buffer containing 50 or 500 mm NaCl yielded dimers as the only cross-linked species, with a significant proportion of protein appearing as monomer (data not shown). The addition of 2 mm MgCl2 or 2 mm ZnCl2 to the cross-linking reactions resulted in the formation of a few higher order oligomers, but dimer remained the predominant species along with uncross-linked monomers. However, removal of the N-terminal domain also removed the majority of the lysines from Dps-dn and Dps-met, which are necessary for glutaraldehyde-mediated cross-linking. To determine rigorously the state of association of Dps-dn compared with Dps-1, FPLC-gel filtration experiments were carried out. From the gel filtration column, the majority of Dps-1 eluted as a high molecular weight oligomer corresponding to Mr ∼ 310, consistent with the dodecamer mass (Fig. 3, b–c). An additional peak appeared at an elution volume of ∼75 ml, indicating the presence of some lower oligomeric species. In contrast, His6-tagged Dps-dn eluted as a single peak of Mr ∼ 44, corresponding to the dimer mass. Consistent results were obtained by native PAGE analysis of Dps-1 and the mutant proteins. On a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, His6-tagged Dps-dn, shown by FPLC to exist exclusively as a dimer, migrated as a single band (Fig. 3d, lane 3) with a molecular mass close to BSA (lane 1), whereas dodecameric Dps-1 remained very close to the well of the gel (lane 2). Dps-met, on the other hand, when electrophoresed on a 5% native gel, revealed the presence of two distinct species, one faint lower oligomeric species that migrates near BSA and a larger oligomeric species that runs much higher in the gel (lane 4). The mobility of the lower oligomer of Dps-met is consistent with a dimer mass. Removal of the His6 tag from Dps-dn did not cause assembly of a dodecamer as seen by the even faster migration of the cleaved protein in the native gel (lane 5), whereas His-cleaved Dps-met migrated exclusively as a dodecamer after incubation at room temperature for half an hour in the presence of divalent cation (lane 6), suggesting that the His6 tag of Dps-met hindered proper assembly of the dodecamer. Because the metal is coordinated in part by two histidine residues, these data also suggest that the reason for interference from the vicinal His6 tag is that it impedes proper metal coordination. This interpretation is also consistent with the apparent slower mobility of His6-tagged Dps-met in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2), which suggests that Dps-1 is more compact than Dps-met due to metal coordination at the N-terminal site. Evidently, retention of the N-terminal metal-binding site is essential for assembly of a dodecameric species. Iron Oxidation Is Not Compromised in Dps-dn and Dps-met— In accordance with the presence of the ferroxidase center, both of the mutant proteins retained the ability to oxidize iron. A progress curve of iron oxidation was measured at 310 nm using His6-tagged proteins. As shown in Fig. 4, upon the addition of five Fe(II) per ferroxidase site, the absorbance gradually increased with time, which implies that Fe(II) was converted to Fe(III) by utilizing the molecular oxygen present in the air. Though Dps-dn was able to oxidize iron, as previously reported for dimeric wild type Dps-1, it did not exhibit significant absorbance at 300–400 nm after the ferroxidation reaction, indicating no mineralized iron core formation (26Macara I.G.

https://openalex.org/W1981866647,"Aldolase plays essential catalytic roles in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. However, aldolase is a highly abundant protein that is remarkably promiscuous in its interactions with other cellular proteins. In particular, aldolase binds to highly acidic amino acid sequences, including the C terminus of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, an actin nucleation-promoting factor. Here we report the crystal structure of tetrameric rabbit muscle aldolase in complex with a C-terminal peptide of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. Aldolase recognizes a short, four-residue DEWD motif (residues 498-501), which adopts a loose hairpin turn that folds around the central aromatic residue, enabling its tryptophan side chain to fit into a hydrophobic pocket in the active site of aldolase. The flanking acidic residues in this binding motif provide further interactions with conserved aldolase active site residues Arg-42 and Arg-303, aligning their side chains and forming the sides of the hydrophobic pocket. The binding of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein to aldolase precludes intramolecular interactions of its C terminus with its active site and is competitive with substrate as well as with binding by actin and cortactin. Finally, based on this structure, a novel naphthol phosphate-based inhibitor of aldolase was identified, and its structure in complex with aldolase demonstrated mimicry of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein-aldolase interaction. The data support a model whereby aldolase exists in distinct forms that regulate glycolysis or actin dynamics. Aldolase plays essential catalytic roles in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.

Aldolase directs glycolysis and gluconeogenesis by reversibly catalyzing the conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) 3The abbreviations used are: FBP, fructose-1,6-bis(phosphate); MIC2, micronemal protein 2; TRAP, thrombospondin-related anonymous protein; WASP, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein; NASEP, naphthol AS-E phosphate. 3The abbreviations used are: FBP, fructose-1,6-bis(phosphate); MIC2, micronemal protein 2; TRAP, thrombospondin-related anonymous protein; WASP, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein; NASEP, naphthol AS-E phosphate. into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxy-acetone phosphate (1Meyerhof O. Lohmann K. Sehuster P.H. Biochem. Z. 1936; 236: 301-319Google Scholar). However, free pools of aldolase also cross-link actin filaments (2Clarke F.M. Morton D.J. Biochem. J. 1976; 159: 797-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and can bundle microtubules by binding to the α subunit of tubulin (3Volker K.W. Reinitz C.A. Knull H.R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 112: 503-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Volker K.W. Knull H.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 338: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These findings, along with those indicating that other glycolytic enzymes also bind to components of the actin cytoskeleton and microtubule network, support the concept that the cytoskeleton and microtubule network forms scaffolds that allow for the efficient delivery of substrates and products in this essential pathway of intermediary metabolism.Precisely how aldolase directs the bundling of microtubules and cross-linking of actin filaments is not resolved. Such diverse functions suggest that aldolase might have several binding partners, and, indeed, the enzyme interacts with several other proteins in the cell, including the glucose transporter GLUT4 (5Kao A.W.

Gavilanes F. Albar J.P. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the erythrocyte anion exchanger Band 3 protein (8Strapazon E. Steck T.L. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1421-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, parasite aldolase also interacts with invasin proteins of pathogens such as Toxoplasma gondii, where it directs the entry and motility of this parasite by binding to the cytoplasmic tail of the micronemal protein 2 (MIC2), and this is critical for the association of MIC2 with actin filaments (9Jewett T.J. Sibley L.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 885-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Moreover, the MIC2 homologue thrombo-spondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) in Plasmodium falciparum also binds to aldolase (10Buscaglia C.A. Coppens I. Hol W.G. Nussenzweig V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4947-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, aldolase can function as a bridge that connects its partners to the actin cytoskeleton and can take part in the regulation of their activity.The binding motif of TRAP for aldolase is comprised of a short stretch (∼8) of acidic residues and a subterminal tryptophan residue. This motif is present in several cytoskeletal proteins, in particular in the N terminus of cortactin, which directs activation of the Arp2/3 complex (11Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y.X. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), and in the C termini of several members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family, including WASP, N-WASP, and the three WASP family verprolin homologous proteins, WAVE-1, WAVE-2, and WAVE-3. WASP family proteins are critical regulators of actin dynamics that bind to actin monomers and that activate the Arp2/3 complex to promote and direct actin nucleation (12Yarar D. To W. Abo A. Welch M.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The C terminus of all WASP proteins comprises three domains, the verprolin homology (WASP homology 2/WH2), central, and acidic domains, which together are all necessary and sufficient to activate actin polymerization by the Arp2/3 complex (13Yamaguchi H. Miki H. Suetsugu S. Ma L. Kirschner M.W. Takanewa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12631-12636Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The central domain binds to the Arp2/3 complex and induces conformational changes necessary for actin polymerization (15Panchal S.C. Kaiser D.A. Torres E. Pollard T.D. Rosen M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), but this domain also plays a role in the autoinhibition of WASP proteins (16Kim A.S. Kakalis L.T. Abdul-Manan N. Liu G.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), whereas the verprolin homology domain binds to actin monomers (17Miki H. Takanewa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The acidic domain of WASP family proteins is also required for binding to Arp2/3 (18Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1347-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar), and it directs the interactions of WASP proteins with aldolase (19Buscaglia C.A. Penesetti D. Tao M. Nussenzweig V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1324-1331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), suggesting that this interaction directs the actin cross-linking functions of aldolase.The binding of aldolase with WASP proteins is competitively inhibited by its substrates and products, suggesting that the acidic domain of WASP interacts with the active site of aldolase. Here we report the crystal structure of rabbit muscle aldolase in complex with the 15 C-terminal residues of WASP. This structure reveals that the WASP interaction indeed disrupts the binding of substrates to the active site of aldolase and that WASP competes with the aldolase C terminus by interacting with the periphery of the active site. Finally, using the WASP-aldolase structure as a guide, we identified and solved the structure of aldolase in complex with a novel competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. The results support a model where the regulation of actin dynamics is linked to the intermediary metabolism by aldolase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptides and Inhibitors—WASP peptide (EDQAGDEDEDDEWDD) was synthesized by the Hartwell Center (St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). Naphthol AS-E phosphate (NASEP), C17H13NO5ClP, was purchased from Research Organic Inc.Purification and Crystallization—Recombinant rabbit muscle aldolase was expressed and purified as described previously (20Morris A.J.

Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 2040-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Aldolase concentration was determined using an extinction coefficient of 0.91 (mg/ml)-1 at 280 nm (22Baranowski T. Niederland T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 180: 543-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity was monitored by spectrophotometry (23Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1947; 167: 843-854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and native aldolase was crystallized as described previously (24St-Jean M. Lafrance-Vanasse J. Liotard B. Sygusch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27262-27270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The WASP-aldolase complex was co-crystallized by vapor diffusion from a 1:1 mixture of protein-peptide solution (0.084 mm aldolase tetramer and 1.5 mm WASP peptide in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) and precipitant solution (24% polyethylene glycol 550 monomethyl ether, 50 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m HEPES pH 7.5). This mixture was then equilibrated against a reservoir of precipitant solution.Data Collection and Processing—A native aldolase crystal was soaked in a NASEP solution (mother liquor plus 3 mm NASEP) for 8 min. The crystal was cryoprotected by transfer through a cryobuffer solution (NASEP solution plus 20% glycerol) and flash-frozen in a stream of gaseous N2. Diffraction data were collected at beamline X8-C of the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton New York).

The WASP-aldolase complex crystal was also a P21 space group, and its structure was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of a native aldolase homotetramer (PDB code 1ZAH) as a starting model. Each asymmetric unit contains one aldolase homotetramer, which is the active form of the enzyme. All observed reflections having an I/σ(I) value of >1 were used in the refinement process. However, statistics and electron density maps were calculated to 2.05 Aå, a resolution limit corresponding to the completeness of better than 70% in the highest resolution shell (Table 1). The structures were subjected to iterative rounds of refinement with the Crystallography and NMR System (26Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

A portion of the aldolase C-terminal sequence between residues 346 and 357 rich in alanine and glycine amino acids was associated with weak electron density in both WASP-aldolase and NASEP-aldolase and was omitted from the refined model. Residues 358-363 were clearly discernable in a simulated annealing electron density omit map.Ligand modeling was based on interpretation of electron density shapes of an Fo - Fc-simulated annealing omit map and using PRODRG for topology and parameter generation (28Schuttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4142) Google Scholar). Binding by WASP peptide residues (498-501) and NASEP were readily discernable and were associated with clearly defined electron densities in the active site. Difference electron density (Fo - Fc)-annealed omit maps calculated in the final round of refinement confirmed identical binding of ligands in all four subunits. Model statistics were evaluated with crystallography NMR software and PROCHECK (29Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) (Table 1). The refined structures of the WASP-aldolase and the NASEP-aldolase complexes have, respectively, Rcryst (Rfree) of 0.152 (0.200) and 0.149 (0.197), with corresponding Luzzati atomic coordinate errors evaluated at 0.18 and 0.17 Aå. Ramachandran analysis of structures with PROCHECK placed 91.8% (WASP-aldolase) and 92.5% (NASEP-aldolase) of nonglycine and nonproline residues in the most favorable region and the remainder in the allowed region, attesting to good model geometry in the structures.The coordinates and structure factors of the WASP-aldolase complex and NASEP-soaked aldolase have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under PDB codes 2OT0 and 2OT1, respectively. All figures in the present paper were prepared using the program PyMOL (30DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. 2004; (DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA)Google Scholar).Structure Comparisons—Structure superposition was performed using PyMOL. To evaluate the overlap of binding loci between the aldolase substrate FBP and WASP and the conformational changes upon WASP peptide binding, the WASP-aldolase complex was superposed on the structure of aldolase covalently bound to FBP as a Schiff base intermediate (PDB code 1ZAI) (24St-Jean M. Lafrance-Vanasse J. Liotard B. Sygusch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27262-27270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) using Cα atoms of residues 101-200. Residues common to both structures were selected on the basis of the lowest root mean square deviation upon superposition and comparable with the error in atomic coordinates of the model.WASP Homologue Modeling—The C terminus region of T. gondii MIC2 (residues 765-768) and that of P. falciparum TRAP (residues 556-559), both homologous to the WASP peptide, were threaded into the WASP peptide structure using PyMOL. Side chain conformations were selected from the PyMOL rotamer library that resulted in no steric clashes with aldolase active site residues.RESULTSThe Structure of the WASP-Aldolase Complex—The interaction between the WASP C-terminal domain and glycolytic aldolase requires the penultimate tryptophan residue in the C terminus of WASP (19Buscaglia C.A. Penesetti D. Tao M. Nussenzweig V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1324-1331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This interaction is displaced by aldolase substrates, suggesting the aldolase active site also binds to WASP. However, precisely how aldolase interacts with WASP is unknown. To define this interaction, rabbit muscle aldolase was co-crystallized with a 15-mer WASP C-terminal peptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence EDQAGDEDEDDEWDD (residues 488-502).The structure of the WASP peptide in complex with aldolase was solved to 2.05 Aå resolution by molecular replacement using a native aldolase tetramer (PDB code 1ZAH) as the search model. Crystallographic refinement yielded a model with Rcryst and Rfree values of 15.2 and 20.0%, respectively (Table 1). A difference (Fo - Fc)-simulated annealing omit map was used to build the WASP peptide in the active sites of tetrameric aldolase (Fig. 1). Only WASP residues 498-501 could be traced from the electron density and were included in the model. Residues 488-497 and 502 appeared disordered and were not fitted into electron density. The modeled WASP peptide adopted the same conformation in all aldolase subunits and the N- to C-terminal orientation of the peptide was unambiguously assigned on the basis of the trace of residues 499-501 in the electron density map. The relatively high average B-factor of the WASP peptides (60 ± 7Aå2) in comparison with the overall B-factor for the protein (23 ± 10 Aå2) suggests a loose binding of WASP for the aldolase active site. To verify this weak binding, a crystal of the WASP-aldolase complex was soaked in the presence of a fresh 10 mm WASP peptide solution for 2 min, and the electron density map calculated from data collected on this crystal revealed no new additional features (data not shown). These data are consistent with a low ordered binding to aldolase by the WASP 15-mer peptide under these crystallization conditions.The binding site used by the WASP peptide delineates a novel hydrophobic pocket within the aldolase active site. This pocket is generated by the side chains of Arg-42 and Arg-303, which loosely sandwich (3.6 ± 0.1-3.8 ± 0.1 Aå) the planar tryptophan side chain between them, and also by the Gln-306 side chain that contributes (3.8 ± 0.1 Aå) to the hydrophobic environment that surrounds the tryptophan side chain (Fig. 1, magenta dashes). Moreover, the nitrogen atom of the tryptophan indole ring hydrogen bonds to the carboxylate group of the Glu-34 side chain. These two binding features, characteristic of a tryptophan side chain, account for the requirement of a tryptophan residue in the C-terminal domain of WASP (19Buscaglia C.A. Penesetti D. Tao M. Nussenzweig V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1324-1331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The WASP peptide contains a large number of acidic residues that are complementary to the essential basic character of the aldolase active site, which has a preponderance of lysine and arginine residues. Indeed, the carboxylate of the WASP Glu-499 side chain makes a salt bridge with aldolase Lys-146 Nζ, WASP Asp-498 makes electrostatic interactions with aldolase Lys-41 Nζ and Arg-42 NH1, and its carbonyl backbone makes a weak contact with the Arg-148 side chain. Arg-303 further stabilizes the peptide by interacting with WASP Trp-500 backbone carbonyl. However, the binding geometry (donor-acceptor angle) for these interactions is not optimal (31Pimentel G.C. McClelland A.L. The Hydrogen Bond, W.H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco. 1960; Google Scholar), as they do not fully respect the atom hybridization state, consistent with the low affinity of the peptide to aldolase active site. Hydrogen bonding involving other peptide moieties was not observed.The NASEP-Aldolase Complex—To further probe the WASP binding site on aldolase, a native aldolase crystal was soaked with an inhibitor that mimics the tryptophan residue of WASP and which contains a negatively charged group. A family of naphthol phosphate-based inhibitors, differing in the substituents of the phenyl moiety (from Research Organic, Inc.), were tested on the basis of competitive inhibition of aldolase. The best inhibitor (Ki ≈ 0.1 mm), NASEP, containing a chlorine atom, was selected.The aldolase crystal soaked in a NASEP solution was isomorphous with the native crystal form, and its structure was solved to 2.05 Aå resolution by molecular replacement using a native aldolase tetramer (PDB code 1ZAH) as the search model. The crystallographic refinement resulted in a model with Rcryst and Rfree values of 14.9 and 19.7%, respectively (Table 1). The difference (Fo - Fc)-simulated annealing omit map confirmed the presence of the inhibitor in the active sites of aldolase (Fig. 2). The binding mode was identical in all aldolase subunits.FIGURE 2Naphthol AS-E phosphate inhibitor bound to the active site of aldolase. Difference electron density was calculated from a 2.05-Aå simulated annealing Fo - Fc omit map contoured at 3.0σ level and encompassing Arg-42, Arg-303 (alternate conformations), and the inhibitor. The green dashes illustrate hydrogen bonds.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The NASEP inhibitor utilizes the same hydrophobic pocket as the WASP peptide, again generated by the Arg-303 and Arg-42 side chains. Moreover, the NASEP phosphate group is stabilized by salt bridging one of the two alternate conformations displayed by Arg-303. The NASEP phosphate group also hydrogen bonds to the Gly-272 backbone carbonyl through a water molecule (not shown).A Novel Binding Site in the Active Site of Aldolase—The most salient feature in the binding of both WASP peptide and NASEP inhibitor is their use of the same hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 3). To assess the minimum binding requirements, a native aldolase crystal was also soaked in a mother liquor solution containing 6 mm L-tryptophan for 7 min. However, electron density maps calculated from data collected to 2.0 Aå resolution failed to reveal any distinguishing features (data not shown), underscoring the contribution of acidic residues of the ligand in binding. Thus, although a planar aromatic moiety is necessary for binding, it is not sufficient to ensure binding.FIGURE 3WASP and the naphthol AS-E phosphate aldolase inhibitor utilize a unique hydrophobic binding site. Comparison of both structures shows that the two ligands compete in muscle aldolase for the same binding pocket made up by the conserved residues Arg-42 and Arg-303. The overlapping binding loci are occupied in both cases by an aromatic moiety, the Trp-500 side chain in the case of WASP (A) and the naphthalene ring in the NASEP inhibitor (B). Surface representations of the aldolase active site were generated using the program PyMOL.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)WASP Peptide Competes with the Substrate and the C Terminus of Aldolase—The effect of WASP peptide on substrate binding was evaluated by superposing the WASP-aldolase complex structure on the structure of aldolase covalently bound to its substrate FBP (PDB code 1ZAI) (Fig. 4). Active site adaptation is slight and requires only the reorganization of Arg-303 and Arg-42 side chains to create the hydrophobic pocket to accommodate the tryptophan side chain. The Arg-303 side chain stabilizes attachment by the FBP P1 phosphate and adopts a conformation that results in steric clashes with the WASP Trp-500 side chain and the WASP backbone. The Arg-42 side chain in the FBP-aldolase structure also collides with WASP Trp-500. Moreover, the WASP Glu-499 side chain clashes with FBP C4, C5, and C6 atoms. The binding of aldolase by WASP peptide and by FBP as well as by aldolase triose phosphate products are thus physically incompatible within the aldolase active site.FIGURE 4WASP competes with the aldolase substrate and C terminus in binding to aldolase active site vicinity. WASP peptide is depicted in orange. Superimposed in cyan is shown the covalent Schiff base intermediate formed between the substrate FBP and muscle aldolase in another crystal form (PDB code 1ZAI). Steric clashes occur between side chains of Trp-500 in WASP and both Arg-42 and Arg-303 of aldolase when FBP is bound in the active site. Additionally, the WASP Glu-499 side chain occupies the same position as the FBP C4, C5, and C6 atoms. Attachment of triose phosphate products dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate would also be similarly compromised by WASP binding in the active site. WASP binding does not induce major conformational changes with respect to the native or FBP-bound enzyme forms. Only the side chains of Arg-42 and Arg-303 reorganize to facilitate WASP binding. WASP binding also conflicts with active site binding of the aldolase C-terminal region. In the WASP-aldolase complex, each C terminus residue Tyr-363 interacts identically with Arg-258 found in a subunit interface of an adjacent tetramer (not shown). In the crystal form of the native enzyme and FBP-bound aldolase, the C-terminal region in each subunit adopts different conformations, each capable of interacting with the active site, and in one subunit, C-terminal binding was clearly observed within the active site periphery. The interaction of the C-terminal region with the active site is consistent with a mechanistic role of Tyr-363 in mediating proton exchange during catalysis and in the crystalline state (M. St-Jean, and J. Sygusch, unpublished data). Binding of the C-terminal region at the active site periphery thus interferes with WASP binding in the crystal form of native aldolase and FBP-bound aldolase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Furthermore, Fig. 4 shows that the WASP peptide clashes with the C terminus of aldolase, which can interact with the active site periphery vicinal to Arg-303. This conformation of the aldolase C terminus is also observed in the native enzyme (PDB code 1ZAH) (not shown). The C-terminal regio"

Mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores via the production of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and the consequent activation of IP3-sensitive Ca2+ channels is a ubiquitous means by which diverse stimuli mediate their cellular effects. Although IP3 receptors have been well studied at fertilization, information regarding their possible involvement during subsequent development is scant. In the present study we examined the role of IP3 receptors in early development of the zebrafish. We report the first molecular analysis of zebrafish IP3 receptors which indicates that, like mammals, the zebrafish genome contains three distinct IP3 receptor genes. mRNA for all isoforms was detectable at differing levels by the 64 cell stage, and IP3-induced Ca2+ transients could be readily generated (by flash photolysis) in a controlled fashion throughout the cleavage period in vivo. Furthermore, we show that early blastula formation was disrupted by pharmacological blockade of IP3 receptors or phospholipase C, by molecular inhibition of the former by injection of IRBIT (IP3 receptor-binding protein released with IP3) and by depletion of thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores after completion of the second cell cycle. Inhibition of Ca2+ entry or ryanodine receptors, however, had little effect. Our work defines the importance of IP3 receptors during early development of a genetically and optically tractable model vertebrate organism.

Our work defines the importance of IP3 receptors during early development of a genetically and optically tractable model vertebrate organism. Cytosolic Ca2+ regulates a whole host of cellular processes (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar). Ca2+ is involved in all stages of development of an organism from fertilization and cell division to cell proliferation and differentiation and, ultimately, cell death (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar). How the same signaling ion can control such a vast array of diverse processes is perplexing. The exact form that the Ca2+ signal takes is likely a key factor. Complexities in the Ca2+ signals with respect to time and space are apparent and appear to be decoded by the cell to mediate a given response (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar). Ca2+ signals often derive from the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores.

In nearly all species studied, a large transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration is observed that originates from the point of sperm binding and traverses the egg in a regenerative manner (24Stricker S.A.

Metasynchronous cell cleavage begins during the early blastula period (128–256 cell stage) and after the midblastula transition (512 cell stage), asynchronous cell cycle lengthening is observed (32Kimmel C.B.

BioEssays. 2000; 22: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Localized Ca2+ signals are associated with identified cytokinetic steps during the first two cell cycles (34Webb S.E. Lee K.W.

Furthermore, Ca2+ signals deriving from IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores appear critical for progression from the zygotic to cleavage stage (35Chang D.C. Meng C. J.

However, despite Ca2+ signals being evident in the embryo up to and including the tenth zygotic cell cycle, there is currently a paucity in information regarding the underlying mechanisms involved in their generation at this key stage of development (37Reinhard E. Yokoe H. Niebling K.R. Allbritton N.L. Kuhn M.A. Meyer T. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 50-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 38Creton R. Speksnijder J.E. Jaffe L.F. J.

In the present study we establish the role of IP3 receptors in zebrafish development from the cleavage period up to the midblastula transition. We provide molecular evidence that three subtypes of the IP3 receptor are expressed at the 64 cell stage, that Ca2+ increases in response to IP3 are demonstrable after the first two cell divisions, and that blockade of IP3 signaling at this stage disrupts development of the embryo. Our data highlight the importance of IP3-mediated Ca2+ signaling during early development of a model vertebrate system. Fish Maintenance—Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were purchased from a local supplier and maintained as described previously (39Westerfield M.

Embryos were collected at the beginning of the light cycle and washed in embryo medium comprising 13.7 mm NaCl, 0.54 mm KCl, 25.2 mm Na2HPO4, 44.1 mm KH2PO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, 4–5 drops/liter methylene blue, pH 7.2. Staging of the embryos was performed as described by Kimmel and co-workers (32Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8862) Google Scholar). In Silico Cloning of Zebrafish IP3 Receptors—A BLAST search of the zebrafish genomic data bases with the protein sequence of the human type 1 IP3 receptor (BAA05065) identified many annotated partial sequences for all three isoforms (supplemental Fig. 1). In most of the cases, two or more sequences mapped to the same genomic region; however, they were not always in proximity. For example, for the type 1 IP3 receptor, three sequences were identified on chromosome 11 (supplemental Fig. 1). Although annotated as distinct genes, the two C-terminal sequences were adjacent on the chromosome and, thus, likely corresponded to the same gene (depicted by a loop). The gene corresponding to the N terminus, however, was located some 1 million bp upstream and on the opposite strand. The type 2 IP3 receptor sequences on chromosomes 11 and 18 were also in clearly different genomic contexts. A long contiguous match was obtained for the type 3 IP3 receptor; however, the 5′ region of this gene was annotated as DNA photolyase. Note that although this sequence and the other two type 3 IP3 receptor sequences were on contigs that have yet to be assigned a chromosomal location, they were unlikely to be overlapping based on inspection of the flanking genes. In summary, the above analysis is consistent with the presence of distinct, possibility duplicated IP3 receptor genes in the zebrafish genome. Whether some of the sequences correspond to pseudogenes and/or errors in the assembly is not clear at present. The initial BLAST search did, however, lead to the identification of two large un-annotated genomic clones containing related sequences that spanned the entire length of type 1 and type 3 IP3 receptor. No clones corresponding to the full-length type 2 IP3 receptor were found. Putative type 1 and type 3 IP3 receptor genes were predicted from the identified genomic sequences using the FGENESH+ program, a hidden-Markov model-based algorithm for finding genes with protein similarity, accessible at the Softberry web site. For the type 1 zebrafish IP3 receptor, we used the genomic clone BX548005 and the following mammalian type 1 source sequences (accession numbers in parentheses): human (BAA05065), mouse (P11881) rat (P29994.), and cow (AAF00613). The different models generated were identical except in six small regions. Supplemental Fig. 2 shows a ClustalW alignment of the four source sequences and the corresponding predictions for the zebrafish homologue in the regions that differed. The deviation beginning at residue 2409 (numbering for the prediction based on the human type 1 IP3 receptor sequence) corresponds to the variable region of luminal loop 3 (supplemental Fig. 2A). This region was deleted in all of the predictions except the human one. The apparent discrepancies at positions 318 (supplemental Fig. 2B) and 1672 (supplemental Fig. 2C) correspond to the SI and SII splice sites, respectively. These differences are, thus, likely because of the particular splice variants used as the source sequence since the human sequence lacked the SI splice site, and both the human and cow source sequences lacked the SII site. Minor discrepancies were noted in the predictions at positions 895, 1137, and 1021 (supplemental Fig. 2, D–F). A dipeptide (KG) at position 895, which is conserved in all the known mammalian receptors, was missing in the zebrafish predictions based on the rat and cow sequences (supplemental Fig. 2D). The latter model also lacked a pentapeptide (SSRSN) at position 1137 that was present in the other predictions (supplemental Fig. 2E). In light of the above comparisons, the prediction based on the human sequence was likely the more accurate of the models and, thus, was used for subsequent analysis. However, this model (and the model based on the mouse sequence) did contain a serine residue at position 1021 that was not present in any of the other sequences (supplemental Fig. 2F). A BLAST search of the putative type 1 zebrafish IP3 receptor sequence against EST databases resulted in the identification of two clones (accession numbers EB771432 and EE318107) that confirmed the prediction at the regions depicted in Fig. 1B.FIGURE 1Molecular analysis of zebrafish IP3 receptors.

All four models generated were again largely consistent with only three deviations in sequence at positions 313, 2159, and 2334 (numbering of the prediction based on the human sequence). The sequence flanking the first divergent region was experimentally determined by sequencing of RT-PCR products (see below). ESTs confirmed the human sequence-based prediction at the two remaining divergent regions and also the putative N and C termini (see Fig. 1B). We also identified an additional EST (accession number AL906759) corresponding to residues 78–237. Although all of the models converged in this region, the sequence of the EST indicated the presence of an insert (supplemental Fig. 3A) that was conserved in IP3 receptors from human and mouse but not rat and cow (supplemental Fig. 3B). Because this sequence and a second insert (identified by direct sequencing; see below) were also present in the source genomic contig used for the predictions, they were incorporated in to the human-based zebrafish model. RT-PCR—Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated from ∼100 embryos at the 64-cell stage, and cDNA was synthesized after priming with random oligonucleotides using the Micro-FastTrack mRNA isolation kit and cloned AMV First-Strand cDNA synthesis kit (both from Invitrogen). For end point PCR (Fig. 1A), the following three sets of isoform-specific oligonucleotide primers (spanning at least 1 intron) were designed based on the putative open reading frames: type 1 IP3 receptor, zIPTR1_1F, 5′-GAGGAGGTCTGGCTGTTCTG-3′, and zIPTR1_1R, 5′-GCAGACAACATCCCTCAGGT-3′; type 2IP3 receptor, zIPTR2_1F, 5′-ACATGAAGGAGGACAAGGAG-3′, and zIPTR2_1R, 5′-CAAAAAGAGGCACGCAGGTT-3′; type 3IP3 receptor, zIPTR3_1F, 5′-AGGAGCCGGACACTGGAACA-3′, and zIPTR3_1R, 5′-GGGATTGCTACATTATTGGA-3′. Amplification was performed using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science) with an annealing temperature of 52 °C and an extension time of 1 min. Both strands of the amplified products were sequenced (MWG Biotech). The sequences obtained for type 1 and 2 zebrafish IP3 receptors confirmed the predicted sequences (data not shown). An additional insert, however, was identified for the type 3 sequence (supplemental Fig. 3C) that was partly conserved in other mammalian type 3 IP3 receptors (supplemental Fig. 3D) and which corresponded to an additional exon in the source genomic contig (data not shown).

PfDHODH-catalyzed reduction of CoQD and CoQ2, but not CoQ1, is stimulated as detergent concentrations (Tween 80 or Triton X-100) are increased up to their critical micelle concentrations, beyond which activity declines. Steady-state kinetic data acquired for the reaction with CoQD and CoQ2 in substrate-detergent mixed micelles fit well to a surface dilution kinetic model. In contrast, the data for CoQ1 as a substrate were well described by solution steady-state kinetics.

The global malaria burden is felt predominantly in the developing world targeting the vulnerable populations of children under 5 years of age and pregnant women (1Breman J.G. Egan A. Keusch G.T. Am.

Although several medicinal therapies exist for both prophylaxis and treatment of malaria, resistance has arisen worldwide against many standard treatments, including chloroquine (2Wellems T.E.

The emergence of resistance reinforces the notion that novel drug targets must be discovered and new chemotherapeutics must be developed in an effort to combat the disease.

DHODH enzymes are divided into two families based upon their cellular localization (8Nara T. Hshimoto T. Aoki T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 257: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Family 1A and 1B enzymes are located in the cytosol, whereas Family 2 enzymes possess an extended N-terminal helical domain, which promotes enzyme association with membranes in prokaryotes (9Norager S.

Family 1A and Family 2 enzymes contain a tightly bound flavin co-factor, FMN, which is reduced upon oxidation of dihydroorotate in the first half of the reaction cycle, whereas Family 1B enzymes utilize FAD and an iron-sulfur cluster in addition to FMN (11Jones M.E.

These co-factors are recycled to their oxidized form by the transfer of electrons to fumarate in the case of Family 1A enzymes, to NAD+ in Family 1B enzymes, and to ubiquinone (CoQ; Fig. 1) in Family 2 enzymes (11Jones M.E.

Uhrig M.L. Kimura E.A. Katzin A.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 207: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The malarial enzyme is predicted to contain a mitochondrial localization signal at the N terminus and a 22-amino acid transmembrane domain (amino acids 143–165). Homologs, such as human DHODH, also encode a mitochondrial localization signal immediately prior to the transmembrane domain, and kinetic and structural studies of both enzymes have focused on recombinant enzymes truncated after the predicted N-terminal transmembrane domain (17Baldwin J.

Widom J. Clardy J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 312-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Based on the competition of CoQ with A77 1726, the A77 1726 binding site is speculated to be the CoQ binding site as well (21Davis J.P. Cain G.A. Pitts W.J. Magolda R.L. Copeland R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1270-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This site is not highly conserved between enzymes from different species, and we have previously identified a number of potent and species-selective inhibitors of the malarial enzyme that compete at this site (25Baldwin J. Michnoff C.H. Malmquist N.A. White J. Roth M.G. Rathod P.K. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21847-21853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The inhibitor/CoQ binding site is formed by two α-helices, which, in the primary amino acid sequence, lie between the predicted N-terminal transmembrane domain and the canonical β/α barrel domain. These α-helices are contiguous with the predicted transmembrane domain and are therefore likely to be adjacent to the surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 2). The localization of malarial DHODH to the inner mitochondrial membrane and its requirement for a lipophilic substrate (CoQ) both suggest that a kinetic model that takes into account catalysis at a surface-solution interface might be appropriate to describe the system. A number of groups have independently formulated schemes to describe catalysis in just such an environment (26Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

Eaton B.R. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9013-9020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This model accounts for both the three-dimensional bulk interactions and two-dimensional surface interactions that occur between enzyme and substrate-detergent mixed micelles. Using this form of analysis, the initial enzyme association with the substrate-detergent mixed micelle surface was kinetically separated from subsequent substrate binding and catalysis, and kinetic parameters that describe each process were individually derived. This kinetic approach has been utilized to describe a number of systems involving enzymes with hydrophobic or amphipathic substrates, or inhibitors, that have no appreciable aqueous solubility (26Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Although the literature contains numerous examples of enzymes exhibiting surface dilution kinetics, these studies have been almost exclusively limited to lipid kinases, synthases, decarboxylases, phosphatases, and lipases acting upon lipid substrates (30Deems R.A.

Surface dilution kinetic analysis of ubiquinone-utilizing enzymes has so far been limited to the study of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase (35Engel W.D. Schagger H. von Jagow G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 592: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the studies presented here, we show that N-terminal truncated PfDHODH forms high molecular weight aggregates in the absence of detergent and that despite the truncation of the transmembrane-spanning domain, the enzyme associates with liposomes. We adopted an isothermal titration calorimetry-based thermodynamic method to determine partitioning of ubiquinone analogues into detergent micelles and found that synthetic ubiquinone analogues with extended prenyl or alkyl tails (CoQ2 and CoQD) partition into micelles, whereas CoQ1, which has a short prenyl tail, remains in solution. The truncated enzyme displays detergent-dependent activation for both Triton X-100 and Tween 80, with activity increasing as the concentration approaches the critical micelle concentrations (CMC) followed by a subsequent decrease in activity at higher detergent concentrations. However, this behavior is observed only for substrates that partition into detergent micelles. Herein we report steady-state kinetic analysis of all three CoQ analogs at different mole fractions of substrate to detergent. Our finding that longer-chain ubiquinones are largely bound to detergent micelles and thus have finite solution solubility has implications for the kinetic analysis of any enzyme utilizing these substrates. Buffer components, purified glucose oxidase (Type VII from Aspergillus niger) and catalase (from bovine liver), Brij 35, Triton X-100, and Tween 80 detergents and DHODH substrates l-DHO, DCIP, CoQ1, CoQ2, and CoQD were purchased from Sigma and were of the highest quality available. CHAPS detergent was purchased from Anatrace (Maumee, OH). Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Size exclusion chromatography molecular weight standards were from Amersham Biosciences or Bio-Rad. All references to P. falciparum DHODH refer to the N-terminal truncated version unless specifically mentioned otherwise. Protein Purification—Cloning, expression, and purification of N-terminal truncated PfDHODH were performed as described previously (17Baldwin J. Farajallah A.M. Malmquist N.A. Rathod P.K. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41827-41834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with the modification that CHAPS detergent at 1% replaces Triton X-100 at 0.1% throughout protein purification. Critical Micelle Concentration Determination—The CMC of each detergent in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol was determined by the fluorometric 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene method (36Chattopadhyay A. London E. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 139: 408-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Analytical Gel Filtration—Gel filtration was performed on purified recombinant N-terminal truncated PfDHODH using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 analytical gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) calibrated with molecular weight standards. Gel filtration buffer was composed of 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. High salt buffer contained 300 mm NaCl, and no salt buffer omitted NaCl. Gel filtration buffer also contained various detergents when indicated. Enzyme was diluted to 2 mg/ml in the appropriate buffer before loading on the column. Reported apparent molecular masses are the average ± S.E. of at least duplicate experimental determinations. Liposome Binding Experiments—Liposomes were produced by sonicating chloroform-removed PC and PE lipids with gel filtration buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol) until an opalescent solution was produced. Purified recombinant N-terminal truncated PfDHODH was mixed with either 10 mm (each) PC and PE mixed liposomes or gel filtration buffer and dialyzed against gel filtration buffer using dialysis tubing with a 12–14 kDa molecular mass cut-off. Dialyzed samples were applied to a Superose 6 HR 10/30 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) calibrated with molecular weight standards at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Absorbance (light scattering for liposomes) at 280 nm was monitored, and 1-ml fractions were collected. PfDHODH activity of each fraction was assayed at 25 °C using the colorimetric DCIP assay at 600 nm (ϵ = 18.8 mm-1 cm-1) (37Karibian D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) at 0.5 mm l-DHO and 0.12 mm DCIP in gel filtration buffer containing 0.1% reduced Triton X-100. Data from one representative liposome binding experiment are presented. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Partitioning of synthetic CoQ analogues into Tween 80 micelles was examined at 37 °C using a VP-isothermal titration calorimetry microcalorimeter (Microcal Corp., Northampton, MA). The buffer was composed of 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1% Me2SO. Heats of injection were measured for 28 successive 10-μl injections of 5 mm Tween 80 into 100 μm synthetic CoQ analogue. All data were base line-corrected by subtracting the heat of dilution of a 5 mm Tween 80 titration into buffer only. Calorimetry data were fitted by nonlinear least squares to a partitioning model (described below) to obtain the change in enthalpy of partitioning (ΔH) and the partitioning coefficient (K) using the ORIGIN 7.0 software package. Partitioning experiments were performed at least three times, and combined data ± S.E. are reported. Partitioning Model—Observing partitioning by high sensitivity isothermal titration calorimetry was originally developed for studying amphipathic molecules partitioning into lipid membranes (38Seelig J. Ganz P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9354-9359Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Models have since been developed that describe both partitioning into membranes and membrane solubilization (39Heerklotz H. Seelig J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1508: 69-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We have adapted the partitioning model to describe partitioning of lipid-like CoQ analogues into detergent micelles. Since the models have been derived previously (40Heerklotz H. Lantzsch G. Binder H. Klose G. Blume A. J. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 6764-6774Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 41Heerklotz H. Seelig J. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2435-2440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), we present only a brief explanation relevant to our adaptation of the models. Partitioning equilibrium can be described using a partition coefficient (K) to relate the concentration of CoQ free in solution (CQ,f) to the CoQ-to-detergent mixed micelle ratio (Xb) by Xb = K·CQ,f. The ratio Xb is equivalent to nQ,b/nD0 (i.e. the molar amount of micelle-bound CoQ (nQ,b) divided by the total molar amount of micellar detergent (nD0)). Since these molar amounts are contained within the same volume (Vcell), the corresponding concentrations (CQ,b and CD0) can be used to describe Xb as Xb = CQ,b/CD0. Conservation of mass (CQ0 = CQ,b + CQ,f) allows us to describe partitioning equilibrium as in Equation 1. CQ,b=K⋅CD01+K⋅CD0⋅CQ0(Eq. 1) During a partitioning experiment the CoQ concentration in the cell (C0Q) is fixed, whereas the detergent concentration changes as detergent micelles are injected into the calorimeter cell. The first derivative of Equation 1 with respect to detergent concentration yields Equation 2, which is the expression for the change in micelle-bound CoQ (δCQ,b) upon injection of detergent. δCQ,b=K⋅CQ0(1+K⋅CD0)2⋅δCD0(Eq. 2) In the calorimeter cell, δnQ,b = δCQ,b·Vcell, and if the entire partitioning reaction is characterized by a ΔH of partitioning, a single injection of detergent results in the heat described by Equation 3, the partitioning model. δhi=ΔH⋅Vcell⋅K⋅CQ0(1+K⋅CD0)2⋅δCD0(Eq. 3) Enzyme Kinetic Assays—DHODH kinetic assays were performed at 25 °C using 0.5 mm l-DHO in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. Steady-state measurements of orotic acid production were measured at 296 nm (ϵ = 4.3 mm-1 cm-1). Reactions were performed under anaerobic conditions by depleting oxygen through the addition of 10 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 2 mg/ml catalase, and 50 mm glucose and incubation for 5 min prior to assay. Detergent-dependent and surface concentration-dependent kinetic studies were performed by varying the CoQ concentration, the detergent concentrations (Triton X-100 or Tween 80), or both. Specific conditions are described in the figure legends. Detergent-dependent oxidase activity was measured similarly by omitting glucose oxidase, catalase, and CoQ from the reaction mixture. Surface dilution kinetic assays were performed by simultaneously varying CoQ and micellar Tween 80 concentrations to produce various mole fraction isotherms along which the ratio of CoQ to micellar Tween 80 was maintained at several fixed values (1:50, 1:100, 1:200, and 1:400). Micellar Tween 80 was estimated as follows: [Tween 80]micellar = [Tween 80]total - CMC of Tween 80 (12 μm). The mole fraction is obtained by the following: mole fraction of CoQ = [CoQ]/([CoQ] + [Tween 80]micellar). Surface dilution kinetic data were fitted individually to the Henri-Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression using the GraphPad Prism software package and globally to the surface dilution kinetic model (29Deems R.A. Eaton B.R. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9013-9020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by nonlinear least squares analysis using the SigmaPlot software package. All experiments were performed in triplicate, and combined data ± S.E. are reported. Surface dilution kinetic data are presented with overlaid Henri-Michaelis-Menten curves. Surface Dilution Kinetic Model—The surface dilution kinetic model is derived from descriptions of the two relevant kinetic steps (29Deems R.A. Eaton B.R. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9013-9020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the bulk step (Reaction 1), enzyme (E) associates noncatalytically with the CoQ/Tween 80 mixed micelle (A) to form the enzyme-mixed micelle complex (EA). E+Ak1⇌k−1EA(REACTION 1) Formation of the complex is a function of the bulk concentration of both E and A. In surface dilution kinetics, A is defined as either the combined bulk concentration of detergent and CoQ substrate (in the “surface binding model”) or as the bulk concentration of CoQ substrate alone (in the “substrate binding model”) (29Deems R.A. Eaton B.R. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9013-9020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two reaction forms distinguish between a model (“surface binding”) where enzyme initially associates nonproductively with the general micelle surface versus a model (“substrate binding”) where the enzyme directly associates with substrate on the micelle surface, albeit to form a non-productive complex. Reaction 2 illustrates the catalytic surface step, wherein the enzyme-mixed micelle complex EA binds an individual CoQ substrate (B) in the catalytic site. EA+Bk2⇌k−2EAB→k3EA+P(REACTION 2) Since this occurs at the micelle surface, the association is a function of the surface concentrations of both EA and B, and B is therefore expressed in terms of mole fraction of CoQ in the mixed micelle. Catalysis then occurs, producing product (P) and regenerating EA. From these expressions, the surface dilution kinetics equation (Equation 4) is derived (29Deems R.A. Eaton B.R. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9013-9020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). V=Vmax[A][B]KsAKmB+KmB[A]+[A][B](Eq. 4) The apparent dissociation constant for the mixed micelle binding site is defined as KsA = k-1/k1 and is expressed in bulk concentration (molarity) units. The apparent interfacial Michaelis constant is defined as KBm = (k-2 + k3)/k2 and is expressed in surface concentration (mole fraction) units, where the mole fraction of CoQ = [CoQ]/([CoQ] + [Tween 80]micellar). Vmax is equal to the extrapolated Vmax at infinite bulk concentration and unity mole fraction of CoQ substrate. Analytical Gel Filtration of N-terminal Truncated PfDHODH—Similar to other studies on Family 2 DHODH enzymes (18Liu S. Neidhardt E.A. Grossman T.H. Ocain T. Clardy J. Struct. Fold.

Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1031-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the PfDHODH N-terminal predicted transmembrane domain was excluded from the PfDHODH expression construct in an effort to produce a soluble enzyme for expression in Escherichia coli (17Baldwin J. Farajallah A.M. Malmquist N.A. Rathod P.K. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41827-41834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the lipophilic nature of the CoQ substrate and the localization of the enzyme adjacent to the inner mitochondrial membrane suggest that the truncated enzyme may still have a significant hydrophobic surface that could associate with detergent molecules or promote protein aggregation. N-terminal truncated PfDHODH (amino acids 169–569) was subjected to analytical gel filtration under a variety of conditions, including adjusting salt concentration and adding various detergents (Fig. 3). These data show that the 48-kDa truncated enzyme forms high apparent molecular weight aggregates regardless of NaCl concentration in the absence of detergent. In the presence of 0.1% Tween 80, 0.3% Brij 35, or 0.1% Triton X-100 detergents (68-, 25-, or 6-fold above their CMC, respectively), the apparent molecular weight is decreased relative to that found in the absence of detergent. The nonionic detergent CHAPS was tested at 0.1, 0.5, and 1% (0.27-, 1.4-, and 2.7-fold the CMC of the detergent, respectively). Although large protein aggregates appear in the absence of detergent micelles (i.e. in 0.1% CHAPS), increasing detergent concentration beyond the CMC (0.5 or 1% CHAPS) decreases the apparent molecular weight of PfDHODH, eventually approaching that representative of monomeric PfDHODH. The apparent molecular masses are a function of the Stokes' radius of the enzyme-detergent micelle complex and not strictly indicative of an absolute mass. Association of N-terminal Truncated Pf"
https://openalex.org/W2071789393,"Recent studies on chromosome conformation show that chromosomes colocalize in the nucleus, bringing together active genes in transcription factories. This spatial proximity of actively transcribing genes could provide a means for RNA interaction at the transcript level. We have screened public databases for chimeric EST and mRNA sequences with the intent of mapping transcription-induced interchromosomal interactions. We suggest that chimeric transcripts may be the result of close encounters of active genes, either as functional products or “noise” in the transcription process, and that they could be used as probes for chromosome interactions. We have found a total of 5,614 chimeric ESTs and 587 chimeric mRNAs that meet our selection criteria. Due to their higher quality, the mRNA findings are of particular interest and we hope that they may serve as food for thought for specialists in diverse areas of molecular biology."
https://openalex.org/W2078498837,"To identify new sequence elements in the promoter that affect splicing patterns of pre-mRNAs, we analyzed effects of different promoters on alternative splicing of model reporter genes. We compared the E1a alternative splicing pattern in transcripts expressed from the full-length cytomegalovirus, SV40 early, or a hybrid cytomegalovirus/SV40 early promoter and found that the hybrid promoter improved selection of the suboptimal E1a 5′SS-1. Expressing RNA from the hybrid promoter also enhanced selection of suboptimal splice sites in other alternatively spliced reporter genes, demonstrating the generality of this effect. Unlike previously defined promoter elements shown to affect alternative splicing, which were located in the enhancer/upstream activating sequences, the motif identified in this work is positioned within the core promoter; it is comprised of eight T-residues directly upstream of the SV40 early TATA box. This motif was previously implicated in DNA bending and negative regulation of transcription. Together, these results suggest that the identity of transcription complex assembled in the core promoter-dependent fashion can affect splice site selection during pre-mRNA splicing, perhaps by influencing the processivity of transcription elongation.

Together, these results suggest that the identity of transcription complex assembled in the core promoter-dependent fashion can affect splice site selection during pre-mRNA splicing, perhaps by influencing the processivity of transcription elongation. Transcription initiation, elongation, and termination, as well as mRNA capping, splicing, and polyadenylation, are all inter-connected, yet the specific mechanisms underlying these connections are not well understood. Such transcription-splicing connections were first demonstrated by different alternative splicing patterns observed depending on whether pre-mRNA splicing substrates were presynthesized or spliced co-transcriptionally (1Eperon L.P. Graham I.R. Griffiths A.D. Eperon I.C. Cell. 1988; 54: 393-401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 2Robson-Dixon N.D. Garcia-Blanco M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29075-29084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Splicing patterns can also be affected by the rate of transcription elongation (e.g. 3–5 and reviewed in Ref. 6Kornblihtt A.R. de la Mata M. Fededa J.P. Munoz M.J. Nogues G. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2004; 10: 1489-1498Google Scholar). A kinetic model was proposed to explain these findings; in this model, a slow RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) 4The abbreviations used are: RNAPII, RNA polymerase II; CMV, cytomegalovirus; SV40, simian virus 40; UAS, upstream activating sequence; TF, transcript factor; GTF, general TF; PIC, preinitiation complex; ESE, exonic splicing enhancer; RSV, Rous Sarcoma Virus long terminal repeat; MLP, major late promoter; RT, reverse transcription; TBP, TATA-binding protein; SS, splice site; nt, nucleotide; Inr, initiator; WT, wild-type; pos., position. elongation rate facilitates selection of suboptimal splice sites by the spliceosome, favoring inclusion of alternative exons (typically flanked by suboptimal splice signals), whereas a rapid RNAPII elongation rate favors skipping of alternatively spliced exons. Furthermore, these studies suggested that the RNAPII elongation rate is affected by the promoter identity (4 and reviewed in Ref. 6Kornblihtt A.R. de la Mata M. Fededa J.P. Munoz M.J. Nogues G. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2004; 10: 1489-1498Google Scholar). Eukaryotic promoters typically contain a core segment that recruits general transcription factors (GTFs) and an upstream activating sequence (UAS) that provides binding sites for transcriptional activators (7Roeder R.G. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Transcription activation also involves the Mediator complex thought to facilitate interactions between activators and the preinitiation complex (PIC) as they assemble at the promoter (8Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 256-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). PIC assembly starts with binding of the GTF TFIID (composed of the TATA-binding protein TBP and associated TAFs) to the TATA box. The UAS and activators modulate TAF recruitment, which then affect subsequent recruitment of TFIIB, RNAPII, TFIIF, TFIIE, and TFIIH (9Lemon B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2551-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses suggest alternative pathways of PIC assembly, yielding complexes of varied composition (10Muller F. Tora L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Differential expression of TBP-like and TAF-like factors in various cell types or tissues can result in a broad spectrum of functional TFIID complexes (10Muller F. Tora L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, specific sequence motifs in core promoters, the TFIIB recognition element, initiator, and downstream promoter element, can affect transcription by altering binding of GTFs and/or transcriptional activators (11Butler J.E. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2583-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Similarly, the identity of the core promoter can influence selection of enhancer (11Butler J.E. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2583-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Thus, core promoter sequence elements can affect transcription by altering the PIC composition and/or function. All stages of transcription, i.e. the initiation, elongation, and termination, are functionally connected. For example, mutations in the elongation factors FACT or Spt6 also affect initiation (12Kaplan C.D. Laprade L. Winston F. Science. 2003; 301: 1096-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 13Mason P.B. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8323-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 14Biswas D. Yu Y. Prall M. Formosa T. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5812-5822Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and deletion of the elongation factor ATPase CHD1 also affects termination of transcription (15Alen C. Kent N.A. Jones H.S. O'Sullivan J. Aranda A. Proudfoot N.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1441-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 16Simic R. Lindstrom D.L. Tran H.G. Roinick K.L. Costa P.J. Johnson A.D. Hartzog G.A. Arndt K.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1846-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Likewise, transcription initiation, promoter clearance, and elongation are all affected by the PAF complex, which interacts with both initiation and elongation factors and moreover affects 3′ end processing and mRNA surveillance; this is consistent with a role for PAF in modulating multiple aspects of co-transcriptional events during mRNA biogenesis (17Rosonina E. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 167-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). At all stages of transcription, the RNAPII complex directly associates with mRNA processing machineries (18Hirose Y. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1415-1429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Proudfoot N.J. Furger A. Dye M.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). A number of splicing factors are known to influence transcription. For example, in vitro, the association of small nuclear ribonucleo-protein particles with the elongation factor TAT-SF1 stimulates transcription elongation (20Fong Y.W. Zhou Q. Nature. 2001; 414: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and the association of U1 snRNA with TFIIH stimulates transcription initiation (21Kwek K.Y. Murphy S. Furger A. Thomas B. O'Gorman W. Kimura H. Proudfoot N.J. Akoulitchev A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 800-805PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, alternative splicing patterns can be affected in vivo if the transcription elongation rate is altered by an RNAPII mutant with a slow elongation rate, by the presence of transcriptional activators, or by pause sites in the DNA template. This reveals a functional connection between transcription elongation and splice site selection (6Kornblihtt A.R. de la Mata M. Fededa J.P. Munoz M.J. Nogues G. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2004; 10: 1489-1498Google Scholar). In coordinating all these processes, the C-terminal domain of RNAPII is thought to serve as a binding platform for multiple transcription and processing regulators (22de la Mata M. Kornblihtt A.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 23Buratowski S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 679-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 24Meinhart A. Kamenski T. Hoeppner S. Baumli S. Cramer P. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1401-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The identity of the promoter can also affect the splicing patterns of the resulting transcript (2Robson-Dixon N.D. Garcia-Blanco M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29075-29084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Cramer P. Pesce C.G. Baralle F.E. Kornblihtt A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One mechanism proposed to explain these observations involves altered recruitment of splicing factors to the promoter at the stage of PIC formation. For example, the transcription factors Spi/PU.1 (28Hallier M. Lerga A. Barnache S. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4838-4842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and WT1 (29Davies R.C. Calvio C. Bratt E. Larsson S.H. Lamond A.I. Hastie N.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3217-3225Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) interact with splicing factors α-CAPER and β-CAPER (members of the U2AF65 family), affecting both transcription and splicing (30Dowhan D.H. Hong E.P. Auboeuf D. Dennis A.P. Wilson M.M. Berget S.M. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 429-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Multiple studies suggest connections between transcription initiation and 3′ end processing (31Buratowski S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 32Calvo O. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1321-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Additional connections between pre-mRNA processing events and initiation, elongation, and termination of transcription are likely to exist. To further investigate the promoter dependence in pre-mRNA processing, we analyzed the effect of different promoters on splicing of several alternatively spliced minigene reporters. A hybrid CMV/SV40 early (C/S) promoter, in which the upstream region of cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter was fused to the simian virus early promoter (SV40) core promoter, alters the splicing pattern of E1a, improving recognition of the suboptimal 5′SS-1 and thus increasing the levels of 11 S, 10 S and 9 S mRNA. Moreover, the CMV and SV40 early core promoters differently affect alternative splicing; the SV40 core promoter strongly improves selection of suboptimal splice sites as compared with the CMV core promoter. Mutations within the T-stretch element directly upstream of the TATA box in SV40 core promoter change these alternative splicing patterns, identifying this sequence motif as responsible for the observed promoter effect. These results suggest that the core promoter can modulate pre-mRNA expression at the level of splicing. E1a Minigene Constructs—The pCMV-E1a was generated by replacing the KpnI-HindIII fragment of pBSV-E1a (containing the SV40 early promoter) with the KpnI-HindIII fragment of pGL2-CMV (containing the CMV promoter). The pGL2-CMV contains the 681-nt MluI-HindIII fragment of pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) inserted into pGL2 (Invitrogen) between MluI-HindIII sites. The EcoRI-StuI fragment of pBSV-E1a was replaced by the 442-bp EcoRI-PvuII fragment of pBSAd22 (33Kameoka S. Duque P. Konarska M.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1782-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) to produce pMLP-E1a. The pRSV-E1a was generated by inserting the 396-bp MluI-HindIII fragment of pRC-RSV (Invitrogen) into pCMV-E1a between MluI-HindIII sites. In p-α-globin-E1a, the KpnI-HindIII fragment of pBSV-E1a was replaced by a 554-bp fragment of human α-globin promoter amplified from genomic DNA. The pCMV-E1a U5G 5′SS-1 was generated by mutational overlapping PCR. The pC/S-E1a contains the 379-bp KpnI-NcoI fragment of pCMV-E1a (from –614 to –235) inserted into pBSV-E1a between KpnI-NcoI sites. In pC/S-E1a U5G 5′SS-1, the KpnI-HindIII fragment of pC/S replaced the KpnI-HindIII fragment of pCMV-E1a U5G 5′SS-1. For pSVEcore-E1a (containing the SV40 early promoter pos. from 5171 to 37), pBSV-E1a was cut with EcoRV-NcoI, blunt-ended, and religated. pCMVcore-E1a contained the CMV core promoter sequence from pos. +93 to –41. Collagen Constructs—Human collagen COL1A1 gene (exons 12–16) was amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into pCMV-E1a, yielding pCMV-collagen. The plasmids pC/S-collagen, pCMVcore-collagen, and pSVEcore-collagen were generated by inserting individual promoter KpnI-HindIII fragments in pCMV-collagen. pSXN Minigene Constructs—pCMV-ESE, the exonic splicing enhancer (ESE)-containing fragment of wild type (WT) or mutant pSXN-ESE (34Fairbrother W.G. Yeh R.F. Sharp P.A. Burge C.B. Science. 2002; 297: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar) was cloned into pCMV-E1a. pSVE-ESE, pC/S-ESE, pCMVcore-ESE, and pSVEcore-ESE plasmids were generated by inserting the corresponding promoters between KpnI-HindIII sites in the pCMV-ESE construct. pCMV-E1a Deletion Constructs—pCMV-E1a deletion constructs were generated by partial digestion of the pCMV-E1a construct with AatII followed by religation. pCIS, pSIC, and SVEcore Promoter Mutants—pCIS, pSIC, and SVEcore promoter mutants (supplemental Fig. S1) were obtained by overlapping PCR (56Lagrange T. Kapanidis A.N. Tang H. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Luciferase Constructs—Luciferase constructs were generated by subcloning promoters between KpnI and HindIII sites in pGL2 (Promega). Transfections and Reporter Assays—Human cervical epithelial carcinoma (HeLa) and mouse hematopoietic RAW 264 cells were transfected by electroporation with reporter plasmid (10 μg) and with green fluorescent protein (1 μg, to calculate transfection efficiency) and analyzed after 48 h. For reporter assays, HeLa cells were co-transfected with 10 μg of the indicated promoter-luciferase and 1 μg of green fluorescent protein, and after 36 h, cells were counted, lysed, and assayed for luciferase activity. For each construct, three independent transfections were carried out, and all luciferase assays were performed in triplicates. Luminescence was measured by a luminometer, and the values were normalized to the efficiency of transfection. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR Reactions—At 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested, and total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 4 μg of DNase-treated RNA using Superscript reverse transcriptase III (Invitrogen). Primer sequences are: E1a-RT1 forward, 5′-CCGAAGAAATGGCCGCCAGTC-3′; E1a-RT2 reverse, 5′-GGACGCCGGGTAGGTCTTGC-3′; Col1 forward, 5′-CTTTCAAGCTTTAGGGTTTCAGTGGTTTGG-3′; Col2, reverse 5′-GCCTCTAGACCTTAGCACCAACAGCACCAG-3′; SXN1 forward, 5′-GTGGGGCAAGGTGAACG-3′; SXN2 reverse, 5′-GCCTTTGACCTACTAGTGTGGC-3′. PCR reaction products were separated in 2% agarose gels, dried, and exposed. Densitometry was performed using GE Healthcare PhosphorImager. Promoter Identity Affects Splicing Patterns of Adenovirus E1a mRNA—To better understand the mechanism by which promoter elements affect processing of nascent transcripts, we analyzed several well characterized promoters for effects on alternative splicing patterns. An adenovirus E1a reporter was selected because its transcript is short enough to be tested in its entirety yet can be alternatively spliced to produce at least five mRNAs (13 S, 12 S, 11 S, 10 S, and 9 S). These five isoforms arise from selection of various combinations of splice sites: 5′SS-1, 5′SS-2, 5′SS-3, and 3′SS-1 or 3′SS-2 (Fig. 1A) (35Harper J.E. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5945-5953Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We initially tested the human α-globin and CMV promoters because these were reported to exhibit different effects on alternative exon selection (4Kadener S. Fededa J.P. Rosbash M. Kornblihtt A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8185-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We also analyzed three other promoters: Rous Sarcoma Virus long terminal repeat (RSV), adenovirus major late promoter (MLP), and SV40. Each promoter was inserted upstream of an E1a reporter that was transiently transfected into HeLa cells; after 24–48 h, total RNA was isolated and analyzed by RT-PCR, using semiquantitative PCR with a 5′ end-labeled primer (Fig. 1B; see “Experimental Procedures”). For every promoter tested, RT-PCR analysis detected the five E1a isoforms; all promoters similarly expressed high levels of the isoforms derived from selecting optimal 5′SS-2 or -3 (yielding 13 S or 12 S), whereas mRNAs derived from selecting the suboptimal 5′SS-1 (11 S, 10 S, and 9 S) were less abundant (Fig. 1B) (35Harper J.E. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5945-5953Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although the observed effects were subtle, quantitation of the isoform levels revealed reproducible differences between promoters. The α-globin promoter stimulated production of the 11 S, 10 S, and 9 S isoforms up to 16% of the E1a mRNAs (Fig. 1B, lane 5). By contrast, RSV and MLP promoters enabled selection of the 5′SS-1 in only 5–8% (lanes 3 and 4), whereas CMV and SV40 early promoters exhibited intermediate patterns, resulting in 5′SS-1 selection in ∼11% (lanes 1 and 2). This intermediate effect of the CMV promoter is consistent with previous reports (4Kadener S. Fededa J.P. Rosbash M. Kornblihtt A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8185-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 25Cramer P. Pesce C.G. Baralle F.E. Kornblihtt A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11456-11460Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In parallel, mouse hematopoietic RAW 264 cells were transfected with the same set of reporter constructs, yielding similar splicing patterns (Figs. 1B and 2B, and data not shown). Thus, the described promoter effects on E1a splicing are not restricted to HeLa cells. However, in agreement with previous reports (4Kadener S. Fededa J.P. Rosbash M. Kornblihtt A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8185-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 25Cramer P. Pesce C.G. Baralle F.E. Kornblihtt A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11456-11460Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), promoter effects on alternative splicing were rather limited with the strongest (α-globin, 16% selection of 5′SS-1) and the weakest (RSV and MLP, 5–8% selection of 5′SS-1) effects differing only by 2-fold. Hybrid CMV/SV40 (C/S) Promoter Alters the E1a Splicing Pattern by Improving Selection of the Suboptimal 5′SS-1—The E1a 5′SS-1 at position 636 deviates from the 5′SS consensus; the non-consensus U at intron position +5 destabilizes 5′SS:U6 snRNA pairing, affecting positioning of the 5′SS for the first step of splicing (36Kandels-Lewis S. Séraphin B. Science. 1993; 262: 2035-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 37Lesser C.F. Guthrie C. Science. 1993; 262: 1982-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Indeed, a 5′SS-1 mutation (U5G) that restores the consensus G at the intron position +5 significantly increased CMV-driven expression of 11 S, 10 S, and 9 S mRNAs. 5′SS-1 selection increased from 9% (U5, WT) to 26% (U5G) (Fig. 2B, cf. lanes 1 and 2). Thus, the non-consensus U at pos. +5 contributes to the skipping of 5′SS-1. However, even when 5′SS-1 was mutated to match the consensus, it was mostly skipped (74%) when expressed from the fulllength CMV promoter. 5′SS-1 selection was substantially improved when expressed from a hybrid CMV/SV40 early promoter (C/S). The SV40 promoter (366 bp) consists of two tandem copies of a 72-bp repeat (which acts as an enhancer), three copies of the 21-bp repeat, and the 17-bp AT-rich region that spans the TATA box (pos. 15–31). We generated a hybrid promoter (C/S) in which the 72- and 21-bp repeat segments of SV40 were replaced by an upstream fragment of the CMV promoter. Specifically, in the C/S construct, the 109-bp minimal SV40 early core promoter sequence (pos. 5171 to –37) was fused to the 379-bp segment of the CMV enhancer/promoter (pos. –614 to –235 relative to the CMV +1 start site) (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1). Expression of E1a from the hybrid C/S promoter yielded splicing patterns substantially different from those observed using the CMV promoter; transcripts utilizing the suboptimal 5′SS-1 (11 S, 10 S, and 9 S) collectively represented 35% of the total (Fig. 2B, lane 3), in contrast to only 9% when expressed from the full-length CMV promoter (lane 1). This difference was also evident when the U5G 5′SS-1 E1a mutant was expressed from the C/S promoter; in this case, the 5′SS-1 was selected in 84% of total mRNA, in contrast to 26% when expressed from the full-length CMV promoter. Again, similar promoter effects were observed in RAW 264 cells (Fig. 2B and data not shown). Thus, the hybrid C/S promoter substantially enhances selection of the 5′SS-1; this effect could result either from stimulation of the suboptimal 5′SS or from repression of other sites. The upstream CMV promoter region (pos. –514 to –138) contains a complex array of repeated sequence motifs exhibiting enhancer activity (38Boshart M. Weber F. Jahn G. Dorsch-Hasler K. Fleckenstein B. Schaffner W. Cell. 1985; 41: 521-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). The CMV fragment in the C/S promoter (pos. –416 to –37) contains only a portion of this enhancer, raising the possibility that disruption of the intact CMV enhancer element altered the E1a splicing patterns. To test this possibility, we analyzed a series of deletions in the CMV enhancer region (Fig. 2, C and D). None of the eight promoter deletions tested affected the E1a splicing pattern, suggesting that the upstream CMV promoter sequences do not contribute to splicing effects exhibited by the hybrid C/S promoter. Therefore, the observed C/S promoter-dependent effects likely arise from sequences in the SV40 early core promoter. SV40 Core Promoter Sequences Generally Enhance Selection of Suboptimal 5′ Splice Sites—The minimal core promoters of CMV (pos. –31 to +93, CMV core) or SV40 early (pos. 5171 to –37; SV40 early core, supplemental Fig. S1), which encompass the TATA box, initiator (Inr), and downstream sequences, yielded readily detectable levels of E1a RNA (Fig. 3, A and B). The SV40 core promoter displayed a splicing pattern similar to that obtained with the C/S promoter; 11 S, 10 S, and 9 S represented 41% of total E1a mRNA as compared with 10% observed using the SV40 early and CMV full-length promoters (Fig. 3B, cf. lane 3 with lanes 1 and 2). The SV40 early core promoter displayed an even stronger effect than the C/S promoter (41% versus 35%). Thus, in the absence of upstream enhancer sequences, the SV40 early core promoter facilitates selection of the suboptimal 5′SS-1. Expression from the CMV core promoter affected 5′SS-1 selection such that 11 S, 10 S, and 9 S represented 15% of total E1a mRNA as compared with 10% for the full-length CMV promoter (cf. lanes 2 and 4). To investigate the generality of these effects, two other alternatively spliced reporters were analyzed. First, we tested the pSXN reporter (34Fairbrother W.G. Yeh R.F. Sharp P.A. Burge C.B. Science. 2002; 297: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar) that contains human β-globin exons 1 and 2 separated by a short, 34-nt alternatively spliced exon (E2) (Fig. 3C). In the absence of an ESE, the E2 is predominantly skipped due to its small size and the presence of a suboptimal 5′SS (intron positions +3 and +4 are T and G, instead of consensus A/G and A, respectively) (34Fairbrother W.G. Yeh R.F. Sharp P.A. Burge C.B. Science. 2002; 297: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). The pSXN reporters containing either a functional WT or a mutant ESE under the control of different promoters were transiently transfected into HeLa cells, and alternative splicing of E2 was monitored by RT-PCR. As a control, splicing patterns were compared with those of pSXN expressed from the RSV promoter (34Fairbrother W.G. Yeh R.F. Sharp P.A. Burge C.B. Science. 2002; 297: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar) where E2 is mostly included (85% E2 inclusion) in transcripts containing a WT ESE but mostly skipped (72% E2 skipping) in the presence of a mutant ESE (Fig. 3C, lanes 1 and 2). A similar pattern was observed using pSXN-WT ESE expressed from the CMV core, hybrid C/S, or SV40 core promoters (83–87% E2 inclusion, cf. lanes 3, 5, and 7 with lane 1). However, promoter-dependent differences in splicing patterns were observed for pSXN-mutant ESE reporters; although the level of E2 inclusion was similar for RSV (28%; lane 2) and CMV (27%; lane 4) promoters, E2 inclusion was significantly improved by the C/S (80%; lane 6) and SV40 core (83%; lane 8) promoters. Therefore, as shown above for the E1a reporter, the hybrid C/S and SV40 early core promoters facilitate inclusion of a suboptimal exon in pSXN reporter. We also tested the promoter effects on alternative splicing of a collagen reporter, which comprises exons E12–16 with the intervening full-length introns of human COL1A1 collagen gene (Fig. 3D). In E14, a disease-associated 5′SS point mutation (intron position G+5 mutated to an A; G5A) results in exon skipping (39Bonadio J. Ramirez F. Barr M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2262-2268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, under the control of the full-length CMV promoter, WT exon E14 is mostly included (86% E14 inclusion), but E14-5′SS G5A mutant exon is mostly skipped (16% E14 inclusion) (Fig. 3D, lanes 1 and 2). Expression of the collagen E14-G5A mutant from the CMV core promoter also yielded increased E14 inclusion (25%; lane 5). Thus, the CMV core promoter improved selection of the G5A 5′SS as compared with the full-length CMV promoter. Expression of the collagen mutant reporter from the SV40 early core promoter showed a significant improvement of the G5A 5′SS selection, yielding 48% inclusion of E14 (lane 6). However, expression from the hybrid C/S promoter yielded splicing patterns similar to those observed using the CMV full-length or CMV core promoters; E14 was predominantly skipped (23% E14 inclusion, lane 4). Thus, the C/S promoter facilitates selection of the suboptimal E1a 5′SS-1 (Fig. 2B) but not the collagen E14 G5A mutant 5′SS. Although these results do reveal some variation in promoter effects on splicing patterns, in general, the CMV core and full-length CMV promoters affected 5′SS selection only minimally, whereas selection of suboptimal 5′SS was most affected by SV40 early core and C/S hybrid promoters. Similar promoter-dependent changes of splicing patterns were observed for three different alternatively spliced reporters, arguing for the generality of these effects. Splicing Patterns Do Not Directly Correlate with Transcription Activity of the Promoter—To examine a possible influence of the promoter strength on alternative splicing, we analyzed a series of reporters in which a luciferase gene was placed under the control of the full-length CMV and SV40 early promoters, core CMV and SV40 promoters, or the hybrid C/S promoter. Consistent with their well established, strong activity in mammalian cells, both CMV and SV40 early full-length promoters yielded high levels of luciferase activity with the CMV promoter exhibiting 8-fold higher activity than the SV40 early promoter (Fig. 4 D). As expected, CMV and SV40 core promoters displayed the lowest levels of luciferase activity, consistent with the absence of enhancer elements in these constructs, and the hybrid C/S promoter exhibited an intermediate activity (8- and 53-fold lower than full-length SV40 and CMV promoters but 426- and 24-fold higher than the SV40 and CMV core promoters, respectively). Thus, alternative splicing patterns do not"

Glycopeptide antibiotics such as vanco-mycin and teicoplanin are clinically important for the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections. StaL is a 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate-dependent sulfotransferase capable of sulfating the cross-linked heptapeptide substrate both in vivo and in vitro, yielding the product A47934, a unique teicoplanin-class glycopeptide antibiotic. The sulfonation reaction catalyzed by StaL constitutes the final step in A47934 biosynthesis.

This is only the second prokaryotic sulfotransferase to be structurally characterized. StaL belongs to the large sulfotransferase family and shows higher similarity to cytosolic sulfotransferases (ST) than to the bacterial ST (Stf0). StaL has a novel dimerization motif, different from any other STs that have been structurally characterized. We have also applied molecular modeling to investigate the binding mode of the unique substrate, desulfo-A47934. Based on the structural analysis and modeling results, a series of residues was mutated and kinetically characterized. In addition to the conserved residues (Lys12, His67, and Ser98), molecular modeling, fluorescence quenching experiments, and mutagenesis studies identified several other residues essential for substrate binding and/or activity, including Trp34, His43, Phe77, Trp132, and Glu205.

Moreover, vancomycin has been commonly termed a “drug of last resort” for treating life-threatening infections by Gram-positive pathogens, many of which are resistant to most other antibiotics (e.g. methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) (1Williams D.H. Bardsley B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 1172-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 2Kahne D. Leimkuhler C. Lu W. Walsh C. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 425-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). However, the increasing prevalence of infections because of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococci have resulted in elevated rates of morbidity and mortality (3Murray B.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 710-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 4Bal A.M. Gould I.M. Expert Opin. Pharmacother. 2005; 6: 2257-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This serious and growing threat has driven the urgent need for novel antibiotics, including diverse semi-synthetic derivatives of members of this class. Glycopeptide antibiotics are composed of a heptapeptide core containing both common and unusual amino acids. Based on the identity of the core peptide, GPAs can be divided into two major structural classes exemplified by vancomycin and teicoplanin, respectively. The structural diversity of natural GPAs is mainly derived from enzymatic modifications of the core peptide by a variety of halogenase and glycosyltransferase enzymes (2Kahne D. Leimkuhler C. Lu W.

Naturally occurring aglyco-glycopeptide antibiotics are rare because they are converted to their glycosylated form by glycosyltransferases encoded by the producing organism. However, S. toyocaensis lacks glycosyltransferase-encoding genes in the A47934 biosynthetic cluster (8Pootoolal J. Thomas M.G. Marshall C.G. Neu J.M. Hubbard B.K. Walsh C.T. Wright G.D. Proc. Natl.

Sulfotransferases (ST) are a superfamily of enzymes found in species ranging from bacteria to humans, catalyzing sulfonation of a variety of endogenous and exogenous substrates. Although the substrate specificity of individual sulfotransferases differs significantly, all utilize the ubiquitous sulfate donor cofactor, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) (10Chapman E.

Today. 2004; 9: 1003-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Mougous J.D. Green R.E. Williams S.J. Brenner S.E. Bertozzi C.R. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic sulfotransferases are grouped into two major classes as follows: cytosolic STs and membrane-associated STs, which share less than 20% sequence identity and differ in terms of their solubility, size, subcellular distribution, and substrate specificity (10Chapman E. Best M.D. Hanson S.R. Wong C.H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2004; 43: 3526-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 11Negishi M. Pedersen L.G. Petrotchenko E. Shevtsov S. Gorokhov A.

Today. 2004; 9: 1003-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The cytosolic STs (30-35 kDa and situated in the cell cytoplasm) catalyze the sulfonation of small molecules, including hormones, bioamines, drugs, and various xenobiotic agents. The membrane-associated STs (45-100 kDa) are located in the Golgi apparatus and have been implicated recently in crucial biological processes. These enzymes sulfonate larger biomolecules, including carbohydrates and proteins (14Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Angew. Chem Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 391-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar, 15Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Structure-based sequence alignments indicate that both the overall fold and PAPS-binding site are conserved between the two classes. Since the elucidation of the structure of murine estrogen sulfotransferase (mEST) in 1997 (16Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), the crystal structures of several other, mostly cytosolic, sulfotransferases have been characterized (12Rath V.L. Verdugo D. Hemmerich S. Drug Discov. Today. 2004; 9: 1003-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast to a large body of knowledge accumulated on mammalian sulfotransferases, significantly less is known about the pervasiveness and functions of STs and their sulfated products in bacteria (13Mougous J.D. Green R.E. Williams S.J. Brenner S.E. Bertozzi C.R. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). So far, there are only a few bacterial PAPS-dependent sulfotransferases for which the biological significance has been well established. The sulfotransferases NodH and NoeE of Sinorhizobium meliloti are essential for establishing symbiosis by sulfonating secreted root lipo-chitooligosaccharide signals, called nodulation factors (17Roche P. Debelle F. Maillet F. Lerouge P. Faucher C. Truchet G. Denarie J. Prome J.C. Cell. 1991; 67: 1131-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 18Hanin M. Jabbouri S. Quesada-Vincens D. Freiberg C. Perret X. Prome J.C. Broughton W.J. Fellay R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The enzyme Stf0, a novel mycobacterial sulfotransferase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, has been identified and characterized and is responsible for generating the trehalose 2-sulfate moiety of the putative virulence factor sulfolipid-1 (19Mougous J.D. Petzold C.J. Senaratne R.H. Lee D.H. Akey D.L. Lin F.L. Munchel S.E. Pratt M.R. Riley L.W. Leary J.A. Berger J.M. Bertozzi C.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, the crystal structure of Stf0 from Mycobacterium smegmatis, the first from a bacterial source, has also been determined. This structure revealed the molecular basis of trehalose recognition and a unique dimer configuration that encloses the substrate within a bipartite active site. Very recently, a sulfotransferase LpsS from Mesorhizobium loti has been identified to be involved in sulfonation of cell surface polysaccharides, including lipopolysaccharide and capsule (20Townsend G.E.I. Forsberg L.S. Keating D.H. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8560-8572Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, the sulfotransferase Stf3 has been identified recently, which sulfonates an outer envelope molecule in M. tuberculosis involved in mediating virulence in a mouse infection model (21Mougous J.D. Senaratne R.H. Petzold C.J. Jain M. Lee D.H. Schelle M.W. Leavell M.D. Cox J.S. Leary J.A. Riley L.W. Bertozzi C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4258-4263Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). StaL (GenBank™ accession number AAM80529) has been annotated as a putative PAPS-dependent sulfotransferase from analysis of the A47934 biosynthetic gene cluster sequence (8Pootoolal J. Thomas M.G. Marshall C.G. Neu J.M. Hubbard B.K. Walsh C.T. Wright G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8962-8967Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). More recent genetic and biochemical studies have confirmed that StaL is a sulfotransferase capable of sulfating the predicted cross-linked heptapeptide substrate both in vivo and in vitro, yielding the A47934 product. The sulfonation reaction catalyzed by StaL constitutes the final step in A47934 biosynthesis (Fig. 1) (22Lamb S.S. Patel T. Koteva K.P. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 171-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, incubation of purified His6-StaL with various substrates in vitro revealed its substrate specificity and yielded two novel sulfo-glycopeptide antibiotics, sulfo-teicoplanin aglycone and sulfo-teicoplanin (22Lamb S.S. Patel T. Koteva K.P. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 171-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This sulfonation adds to the expanding repertoire of engineering possibilities for glycopeptide antibiotics with the potential to develop new compounds with sulfated N-terminal 4-hydroxy-l-phenylglycine residues. Here we report the crystal structure of StaL and its complex with the cofactor product PAP. To our knowledge, this is only the second prokaryotic sulfotransferase, following the structure of Stf0, to be structurally characterized. This structure reveals that StaL is most similar to the cytosolic STs from mammalian sources and less similar to bacterial Stf0. StaL adopts a unique dimerization motif, different from that of all other STs for which crystal structures have been solved. We have also applied molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the binding mode of the unique substrate desulfo-A47934. Cloning, Expression, and Purification—The staL gene from S. toyocaensis was cloned into a modified pET28a vector (EMD Biosciences, Inc.) and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) fused to an N-terminal His6 tag, as described previously (22Lamb S.S. Patel T. Koteva K.P. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 171-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The gene was cloned starting from the second ATG and is missing the first three codons. Therefore, the expressed StaL has 267 amino acids (excluding the His6 tag) and lacks the N-terminal Met-Asn-Gly sequence. For the production of selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled protein, the E. coli methionine auxotroph strain DL41(DE3) was transformed with the plasmid (23Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). An overnight culture of transformed E. coli BL21(DE3) or DL41(DE3) was used to inoculate 1 liter of 2YT medium (or LeMaster medium for SeMet-labeled protein) containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and grown at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6. Protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside followed by 16-20 h of incubation at 16 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 × g, 4 °C, 25 min) and stored at -20 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100), and the cells were lysed by sonication (eight times for 15 s, with 15 s between bursts). Cell debris were removed by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 45 min, 4 °C). The protein supernatant was loaded onto a 2-ml (bed volume) nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) equilibrated with lysis buffer. After application of the protein sample, the column was washed with 40 ml of lysis buffer, followed by 40 ml of washing buffer consisting of 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. StaL was eluted with the above buffer containing 125 mm imidazole, pH 8. The eluted protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration to 12 mg/ml with concomitant exchange of the buffer to 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. No attempts were made to remove the His6 tag. SeMet-labeled protein was purified following the same protocol. Gel filtration indicated that the native enzyme formed dimers in solution. Crystallization—Initial crystallization conditions were determined by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 21 °C using screens from Hampton Research (Aliso Viejo, CA) and Qiagen (Mississauga, Canada). The best crystals of native StaL (form 1) were obtained by equilibrating 1 μl of protein (12 mg/ml in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol) mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution (0.1 m NaAc, pH 4.6, and 3.0 m NaCl) over 1.0 ml of reservoir solution. Crystals grew to a size of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm3 in 2 days at 21 °C. Crystals of StaL belong to space group P6122 with unit cell dimensions a = 86.0, c = 164.8 Å, and contain one molecule in the asymmetric unit with a Vm of 2.73 Å3 Da-1, corresponding to a solvent content of 55% (24Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7922) Google Scholar). SeMet-labeled protein crystallized under the same conditions. However, two crystal forms appeared in the same drop, with one of these (form 1) isomorphous to the native crystals. The second crystal form (form 2) belongs to space group P41212 with unit cell dimensions a = 89.2, c = 117.3 Å, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit and a Vm of 3.64 Å3 Da-1 corresponding to a solvent content of 66%. For data collection crystals from both forms were transferred to Paratone N oil, and the water layer on the surface of the crystal was carefully removed, and the crystal was picked up in a nylon loop and flash-cooled in a nitrogen stream at 100 K (Oxford Cryosystems, Oxford, UK). We crystallized StaL in the presence of 10 mm PAP (Sigma) from a reservoir solution containing 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m BisTris, pH 5.5, and 22% (v/v) PEG-3350. These crystals (form 3a) belong to the same P6122 space group but are not isomorphous to form 1 crystals and have a = 88.7, c = 169.7 Å. An additional crystal form of StaL obtained by co-crystallization with 10 mm PAP was obtained from reservoir solution containing 0.2 m NaI, 0.1 m BisTris propane, pH 6.5, 20% (v/v) PEG-3350. These crystals (form 4) belong to space group P3221 with unit cell parameters a = 122.3, c = 188.2 Å with four molecules in the asymmetric unit and a Vm of 3.17 Å3 Da-1 corresponding to a solvent content of 61%. Finally, we crystallized StaL (12 mg/ml) in the presence of 10 mm PAP and 5 mm desulfo-A47934 substrate. Hanging drop vapor diffusion over a reservoir solution containing 0.2 m NaI, 0.1 m BisTris propane, pH 6.5, 18% (v/v) PEG-3350 yielded crystals isomorphous to form 3, which we will refer to as form 3b. These crystals grew in 2-4 days and were cryo-protected by a brief transfer to a solution containing reservoir solution supplemented with 15% (v/v) ethylene glycol and flash-cooled in the nitrogen stream at 100 K. Determination of Product Affinity by Fluorescence Quenching—Steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Spex Fluorolog 1681 spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon Inc.). A cuvette containing 500 μl of protein sample was prepared at a concentration of 1.5-3 μm in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of StaL was measured by recording the emission spectra from 300 to 370 nm (2 nm slit width) with a fixed excitation wavelength of 290 nm. Fluorescence quenching experiments were performed by titration of the protein sample with a concentrated stock solution of A47934 dissolved in the same buffer as the protein sample. The concentration of A47934 was varied in the range of 8-135 μm. To eliminate inner filter effects, the absorbance of the enzyme sample did not exceed 0.1 at 290 nm. The spectra were corrected for the intrinsic fluorescence of the A47934 product at each point in the titration. To analyze the fluorescence data, the fluorescence intensities at various concentrations of the quencher were fitted to the Stern-Volmer Equation 1 for the quenching of emitting fluorophores (25Lehrer S.S. Leavis P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 49: 222-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), F0/F=1+KSV[L] where Fo is the fluorescence emission intensity in the absence of quencher; F is the intensity in the presence of quencher at concentration [L]; and KSV is the Stern-Volmer constant (association or affinity constant). A plot of Fo/F versus [L] should yield a straight line with a slope of KSV and an intercept of 1. X-ray Data Collection, Structure Solution, and Refinement—Diffraction data from a form 1 SeMet-labeled StaL crystal were collected to 2.8 Å resolution at three wavelengths (MAD regime) with a Quantum-4 CCD detector (Area Detector Systems Corp., San Diego). Unless otherwise indicated, this and all subsequent data sets were collected at beamline X8C at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. Data integration and scaling was performed with HKL2000 (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar). Seven of the nine expected selenium atoms in the asymmetric unit were located with the program SOLVE (27Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) using data to 3.0 Å resolution. Solvent flattening resulted in a figure of merit of 0.61. The density-modified phases were utilized with a data set from a native crystal (form 1) collected to 2.58 Å resolution at beamline X25 and extended to the resolution limit. Automatic model building with RESOLVE (28Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1937-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) resulted in a starting model containing ∼50% of the main chain atoms and ∼20% of side chains. Remaining parts of the model were built manually using the program O (29Jones T.A. Zhou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar), and refinement was carried out using the program REFMAC (30Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13869) Google Scholar). No σ cutoff was used in refinement. In the final rounds of refinement, we applied the translation-libration-screw model for anisotropic temperature factors (31Winn M.D. Murshudov G.N. Papiz M.Z. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 300-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 32Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar) converging to a final Rwork and Rfree of 0.249 and 0.279, respectively. The N-terminal His6 tag and residues 104-109 and 217-236 were disordered and could not be traced in the electron density map. A data set for form 3a crystals of StaL crystallized in the presence of PAP and ammonium sulfate was collected to 2.61 Å resolution. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program MOLREP (33Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4152) Google Scholar), using the apo-StaL structure as the search model, and refined to an Rwork and Rfree of 0.228 and 0.269, respectively. Only the His6 tag and residues 217-235 were disordered. No density corresponding to PAP was found in the resulting maps, but instead, two sulfate ions were modeled in the PAP-binding site. We refer to this model as StaL-SO4. Crystal form 3b of StaL crystallized in the presence of PAP and desulfo-A47934 yielded data extending to 2.95 Å resolution. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the apo-StaL model and refined to an Rwork and Rfree of 0.224 and 0.269, respectively. The resulting difference electron density clearly showed the presence of a molecule of PAP bound in each subunit, but no density for the antibiotic was found. The final model contained only one disordered segment, consisting of residues 217-235. We refer to this model as StaL-PAP. The tetragonal form 2 crystals diffracted to 3.45 Å, and the structure was solved by molecular replacement. We identified a dimeric association of the molecules similar to that observed in the hexagonal crystal forms, but the structure was not refined further because of the inferior resolution. Finally, the trigonal form 4 crystals diffracted to 3.05 Å at beamline X12C. There are four independent molecules, and the model was only partially refined. Electron density indicated the presence of PAP. but it is less well defined than in form 3b crystals. The form 2 and form 4 crystals diffracted to low resolution, showed dimers indistinguishable from those in better diffracting crystal forms, and were not pursued further.

Single site mutants were created using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with modifications as described below. Synthesis of oligonucleotide primers and sequencing of DNA were performed at the MOBIX Lab Central Facility (McMaster University). Using the previously constructed plasmid staL/pET28a (22Lamb S.S. Patel T. Koteva K.P. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 171-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) as a template, PCR conditions were as follows: 5 min at 95 °C, 16 cycles (1 min at 95 °C, 1.5 min at 55 °C, and 10 min at 68 °C), 20 min at 68 °C with 1 unit of Pfu Ultra® DNA polymerase (Stratagene), 25 or 50 ng of template DNA, 2.5 mm dNTPS, and ∼250 ng of each primer. Subsequent digestion with 10 units of DpnI (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37 °C facilitated destruction of the template DNA. Mutagenized plasmids were then transformed into E. coli TOP10 (Invitrogen) by electroporation. Plasmids were isolated from the transformants and were analyzed by restriction enzyme digests and DNA sequencing. Plasmids containing the confirmed staL point mutations were then transformed into the expression strain E. coli BL21(DE3). Expression, Purification, and Characterization of StaL Mutants—Expression and purification procedures previously reported for wild-type StaL (22Lamb S.S. Patel T. Koteva K.P. Wright G.D. Chem.

Similar expression levels were observed for all mutants except L48K, L48E, and H67A, which exhibited poor expression. Following purification and concentration, in vitro reactions were set up for each mutant with 0.1 mm desulfo-A47934 as the substrate. Conditions were as reported previously (22Lamb S.S. Patel T.

All members of the family characterized to date share some common structural and mechanistic features (2Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) including a homodimeric architecture, similar subunit molecular mass (40–47 kDa), analogous active site structure, a conserved Cys-His-Asn catalytic triad (thus a common reaction mechanism), and the utilization of acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) thioesters as substrates instead of the acyl-carrier protein-linked substrates employed by type I and II PKSs. To diversify polyketide product output, type III PKSs have evolved to use a wide range of natural acyl-CoA substrates. For example, the plant type III PKSs, which share 60–95% amino acid identity (2Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar), utilize a variety of different substrates ranging from aliphatic-CoA to aromatic-CoA, from small acetyl-CoA (2-pyrone synthase in Gerbera hybrida) (15Eckermann S.

Interestingly, the more divergent bacterial type III PKSs (with as low as 20% amino acid identity) utilize a much narrower pool of natural acyl-CoA substrates than their relatives in plants (1Moore B.S. Hopke J.N. Chembiochem. 2001; 2: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 2Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar).

Such limited physiological substrate specificity may be misleading because of a paucity of information on functionally identified bacterial type III PKSs (12Sankaranarayanan R. Saxena P. Marathe U.B. Gokhale R.S. Shanmugam V.M. Rukmini R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 894-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26Gross F. Luniak N. Perlova O. Gaitatzis N. Jenke-Kodama H. Gerth K.

Biotechnol. 2003; 106: 233-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), a reflection of the short period of time since their discovery. Alternatively, the more limited substrate variability of bacterial type III PKSs might reflect convergent evolution within this family resulting from the more limited availability of acyl-CoA building blocks in prokaryotes compared with eukaryotes. With respect to the limited “building block” diversity in bacteria, it is intriguing that such seemingly divergent bacterial type III PKSs utilize a common starter unit. Understanding the convergence of bacterial type III PKS structure and function could provide important insights into substrate preferences and specificity, potentially enabling expansion of the repertoire of unnatural substrates and thus the creation of functionally diverse and novel natural products. S. griseus RppA (Sg-RppA) has provided substantial fundamental information about the catalytic properties of the type III PKS subfamily as the first functionally characterized bacterial enzyme of its class (19Funa N. Ohnishi Y. Fujii I. Shibuya M. Ebizuka Y. Horinouchi S. Nature. 1999; 400: 897-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 28Funa N. Ohnishi Y. Ebizuka Y. Horinouchi S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 781-789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological reaction (Fig. 1A) is initiated by loading a malonyl-CoA molecule covalently onto the catalytic Cys138 of the RppA polypeptide. Four acetyl-CoA extender units, generated from decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA, are then added sequentially to the elongating linear intermediate via Claisen condensation. Finally, the linear pentaketide intermediate is cyclized and aromatized to form 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene (THN), although the mechanism of this termination step remains unclear. During growth of the linear polyketide intermediate, the terminal carboxyl group is presumably derived from the starter malonyl-CoA and is prevented from premature decarboxylation, which would result in derailment to acetyl-CoA or triacetic acid lactone (TAL; 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-pyrone) via intramolecular cyclization (Fig. 1A). The importance of the active site Tyr224 residue in the first step of this reaction relating to starter unit specificity of Sg-RppA was previously identified through analyzing the ability of a series of mutants to produce THN (28Funa N. Ohnishi Y. Ebizuka Y. Horinouchi S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 781-789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was revealed that although the aromatic amino acid Trp or Phe replacement of Tyr224 is tolerated by Sg-RppA, other Tyr224 mutants including Y224L, Y224G, and Y224C are inactive. In contrast, these mutants are functional when hexanoyl-CoA or phenylacetyl-CoA is presented as a nonphysiological starter unit. On the basis of these observations, Funa et al. (28Funa N. Ohnishi Y. Ebizuka Y. Horinouchi S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 781-789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that Tyr224 in Sg-RppA is critical for starter unit (malonyl-CoA) selection. Interestingly, this Tyr residue is also conserved in DpgA and PhlD (supplemental Fig. S1), the other two functionally identified bacterial type III PKSs that utilize malonyl-CoA as the physiological starter unit. The function of Tyr224 in RppA was further discussed by Austin et al. (29Austin M.B. Izumikawa M. Bowman M.E. Udwary D.W. Ferrer J.-L. Moore B.S. Noel J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45162-45174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) upon analyzing the crystal structure of S. coelicolor RppA (Sc-RppA), which is the closest relative to S. griseus RppA (67% amino acid identity) and catalyzes an identical series of reactions. In the 2.22 Å crystal structure, Tyr224 was found at the surface of the active site pocket of Sc-RppA (8.5 Å away from the catalytic Cys138) and was believed to exert a horizontal steric constraint to the first entering malonyl-CoA through its bulky side chain, thereby positioning the starter unit at a favorable location (near the catalytic Cys138) by limiting conformational freedom. Accordingly, the small amino acid Gly cannot play a similar role. Thus, when the position corresponding to Tyr224 is occupied by a Gly in CHS (supplemental Fig. S1), this plant type III PKS cannot use malonyl-CoA as a starter unit. It is evident that the Gly residue provides additional space for accommodating the bulky substrate p-coumaroyl-CoA (30Jez J.M. Bowman M.E. Noel J.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14829-14838Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 31Jez J.M. Austin M.B. Ferrer J.-L. Bowman M.E. Schroder J. Noel J.P. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 919-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This volume-modulating model for substrate specificity is currently well accepted (2Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 31Jez J.M. Austin M.B. Ferrer J.-L. Bowman M.E. Schroder J. Noel J.P. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 919-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, it has remained unclear how inactive Tyr224 mutants (Y224L, Y224G, and Y224C) enable selection of unnatural acyl-CoAs as the starter unit substrate in Sg-RppA. Although Sc-RppA and Sg-RppA are highly homologous and possess nearly identical active site compositions, Sc-RppA was reported to have higher tolerance toward unnatural acyl-CoA starter units than Sg-RppA (25Jeong J.-C. Srinivasan A. Grüschow S. Bach H. Sherman D.H. Dordick J.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 64-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For example, both acetyl-CoA and benzoyl-CoA were substrates for the Sc-RppA yet were not accepted by Sg-RppA (24Funa N. Ohnishi Y. Ebizuka Y. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4628-4635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, considering the broader flexibility, together with the corresponding x-ray crystal structure, Sc-RppA represents a compelling target for the study of substrate specificity because of its ability to accept various unnatural substrates, especially acyl-CoAs, which cannot be utilized by Sg-RppA. In the current study we generated a series of point mutations at the Tyr224 residue in Sc-RppA and compared the resulting product profile to the wild type (WT) enzyme. To elucidate further how this residue determines substrate selectivity, acetoacetyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA, hexanoyl-CoA, and benzoyl-CoA, which, respectively, represent the spectrum of similar, smaller, and larger (aliphatic hexanoyl-CoA and aromatic benzoyl-CoA) substrates compared with malonyl-CoA, were examined as unnatural acyl-CoA starter units by both WT and Tyr224 mutant forms of Sc-RppAs. Moreover, the correlation between substrate loading and product formation of these enzymes was examined by radioactive substrate binding analysis. This investigation confirmed that the inability of Tyr224 mutants to synthesize THN results from failure to load malonyl-CoA onto the catalytic Cys residue as opposed to failure of subsequent chain elongation, cyclization, or product release steps. S. coelicolor RppA Gene Cloning—Genomic DNA was prepared from S. coelicolor A3 (2Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) using a Wizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega). The Sc-RppA gene was amplified by PCR under standard conditions with a pair of primers as follows: forward, 5′-AATCATATGGCGACTTTGTGC-3′ (the underlined bases represent the introduced NdeI site for further cloning); reverse, 5′-AATAAGCTTTCATGCCTGCCTGCCTCACCC-3′ (the underlined letters indicate a HindIII restriction site for later cloning). The full-length cDNA encoding Sc-RppA was rescued by double digestion of NdeI and HindIII. The fragment containing Sc-RppA gene was ligated into previously NdeI/HindIII-digested pET-28b(+) (Novagen) to generate the recombinant plasmid pET-28b(+)-Sc-RppA. This construct was then transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) for protein overexpression. The accuracy of the inserted Sc-RppA gene was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Site-directed Mutagenesis, Protein Overexpression, and Purification—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the QuikChange (Stratagene) protocol with pET-28b(+)-Sc-RppA as template. The PCR-amplified plasmids containing mutations were verified by DNA sequencing and then directly used for transforming the protein overexpression strain E. coli BL21(DE3). The resulting transformants were grown at 37 °C overnight in Luria broth containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and 10 ml of culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of Terrific Broth containing 50 μg/ml of kanamycin. The Terrific Broth culture was incubated at 37 °C for 3∼4 h until A600 reached 0.6–1.0. Then, gene overexpression was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm and cultured at 18 °C overnight. The culture was centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 10 min to collect cells. The freeze-thaw cell pellet was resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer (250 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm imidazole, 20% glycerol, pH 7.9), and the cell lysate was prepared by lysozyme digestion at 1 mg/ml for 30 min with subsequent sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min, and the soluble fraction was mixed with 2 ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4°C. The slurry was loaded onto an empty column. The column was then washed stepwise with 20 ml of lysis buffer and 40–60 ml of wash buffer (250 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 40 mm imidazole, 20% glycerol, pH 7.9). The His6 tag bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer (250 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 200 mm imidazole, 20% glycerol, pH 7.9). The target protein was further purified and concentrated with YM-10 centrifuge filters (Amicon). Finally, the elution buffer was exchanged for storage buffer (250 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 20% glycerol, pH 7.4) with a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare), and the resulting product concentrations were measured by Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as standard. Purity and molecular mass were examined by standard SDS-PAGE analysis. RppA Enzymatic Assay—The standard assay containing 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.2 mm acyl-CoA starter, and 3 μm WT or mutant RppA in a total volume of 100 μl was initiated by adding malonyl-CoA to a final concentration of 0.5 mm and was quenched with the addition of 10 μl of 6 m HCl after incubation at 30 °C for 1 h. Small amounts of enzyme were removed by centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was used directly as the sample for HPLC analysis. Reverse-phase HPLC conditions were as follows, using an XBridge C18 5-μm column (4.6 × 250 mm): the mobile phase for the malonyl-CoA-, acetyl-CoA-, and acetoacetyl-CoA-primed reaction was linear from 5 to 35% B (A = deionized water + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; B = acetonitrile + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) over 20 min, and the mobile phase for the hexanoyl-CoA- and benzoyl-CoA-primed reaction was linear from 20 to 70% B over 20 min; the UV detection wavelength was 280 nm for the malonyl-CoA-, acetyl-CoA-, acetoacetyl-CoA-, and hexanoyl-CoA-primed reactions and 320 nm for the benzoyl-CoA primed reaction, at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The peak identity in HPLC trace was determined by mass spectrometry and comparison with authentic compounds regarding HPLC retention time and UV spectrum. Enzyme Kinetics—We exploited the reported coefficient constant for THN at 340 nm (ϵ = 18,000) (20Izumikawa M. Shipley P.R. Hopke J.N. O'Hare T. Xiang L. Noel J.P. Moore B.S. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2003; 30: 510-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) to obtain the steadystate kinetic parameters using a spectrophotometric method. The standard reaction buffered with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing the appropriate concentration of WT or mutant RppA in a total volume of 400 μl was initiated by adding a series of concentrations of malonyl-CoA ranging from 1 to 100 μm and was immediately monitored with a UV-visible spectrophotometer 300 Bio (Cary) at 30 °C. The initial velocity of THN accumulation was deduced from the absorbance curve within the linear range. All measurements were determined in triplicate, and velocities determined under different malonyl-CoA concentrations were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation to calculate the kinetic constants kcat and Km. Radioactive Substrate Binding Assay—The optimized reaction contained 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), 50 μm [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (55 mCi/mmol) and 15.0 μm WT or mutant enzymes in a total volume of 25 μl. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 25 μl of 2× SDS gel loading dye after a 5-min incubation at 30 °C. 10 μl of each reaction mixture was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15%). After staining, destaining, and drying the protein gel on filter papers, the radioactivity bound to the protein was determined by autoradiography following a 4-day exposure using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). WT and Mutant RppA Overexpression and Purification— The substitution of Leu, Gly, Ala, Ser, Met, His, Cys, and Phe for Tyr224 was conducted to explore the effect of locally modifying steric and electronic/polarity properties on starter unit loading. The WT enzyme and Tyr224 series of RppA mutants were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified to homogeneity. As shown by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A), the monomer of each purified protein migrated with a molecular mass of ∼43 kDa. Interestingly, previously reported purification efforts of the corresponding Sg-RppA Y224S and Y224H mutants were unsuccessful due to insolubility (28Funa N. Ohnishi Y. Ebizuka Y. Horinouchi S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 781-789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This discrepancy might result from an intrinsic difference between these two RppAs, the type of cloning system or purification procedure used, or other variables. Nevertheless, each of the Sc-RppA mutant enzymes was expressed as a soluble polypeptide to enable more detailed analysis. Mutant Activity Analysis—Using WT Sc-RppA as a positive control and the catalytic Cys mutants C138A and C138S as negative controls, we first examined the activities of the Tyr224 mutants of Sc-RppA to utilize malonyl-CoA. The reactivity of each mutant was assayed by measuring the amount of accumulated THN by HPLC analysis. Because authentic THN is not isolable due to its rapid conversion to flaviolin (Fig. 1A) (19Funa N. Ohnishi Y. Fujii I. Shibuya M. Ebizuka Y. Horinouchi S. Nature. 1999; 400: 897-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), we elected to deduce the relative yield of THN by integration of the HPLC peak area using WT RppA enzyme as a reference. As shown in Fig. 3A, among the eight Tyr224 mutants, Y224G, Y224S, and Y224H were unable to catalyze assembly of THN (as negative controls). The inactivity of Y224G is not surprising because Y224G of Sg-RppA was also an inactive mutant (28Funa N. Ohnishi Y. Ebizuka Y. Horinouchi S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 781-789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For Y224S (whose counterpart in Sg-RppA was insoluble), this inactivation could be attributed to horizontal expansion of the active site through replacement of a smaller side chain. However, it is currently unclear why the RppA Y224H mutant cannot synthesize THN from malonyl-CoA considering the size of the His side chain. In contrast, Y224F, Y224L, Y224C, Y224M, and Y224A retained 71, 67, 48, 16, and 3% of its activity, respectively, relative to WT Sc-RppA. A previous study reported Y224L, Y224C, and Y224A (but not Y224F) from Sg-RppA to be inactive toward malonyl-CoA (28Funa N. Ohnishi Y. Ebizuka Y. Horinouchi S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 781-789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further probe the basis for this discrepancy, we prepared WT Sg-RppA (from S. griseus NRRL B-2682) and its corresponding Y224L mutant to compare their ability to generate THN. Surprisingly, this Y224L mutant produced an ∼50% level of THN compared with WT Sg-RppA (supplemental Fig. S2). Therefore, this (re)examination of Y224L mutants indicates that the Leu replacement retains significant catalytic activity in both Sc-RppA and Sg-RppA. As described, in addition to the major product THN, a low level of malonyl-CoA would be incorporated into two other derailment products (acetyl-CoA and TAL) because of premature decarboxylation of the oligoketide chain (Fig. 1A). Because the synthesis of these by-products might provide new mechanistic insights into this type III PKS, we extended our analysis to the production of acetyl-CoA and TAL (Fig. 3B). Specifically, the five partially active mutants (Y224F, Y224L, Y224M, Y224C, and Y224A) accumulated corresponding increased levels of TAL relative to WT Sc-RppA, suggesting the dual function of Tyr224. In addition to the contribution to substrate specificity determination, Tyr224 potentially is able to influence the extent of polyketide chain elongation, thus affecting the partitioning of TAL formation. On the contrary, the mutants that lack an ability to synthesize THN were not able to accumulate TAL. This clearly indicates that the biochemical effect from the Tyr mutation occurs prior to formation of the triketide intermediate. Moreover, no CoASH was released (data not shown) strongly suggesting that these inactive mutants cannot load malonyl-CoA. Significantly, all Tyr224 mutants (together with the negative controls) were capable of producing acetyl-CoA, which indicates that this residue has no significant influence on the decarboxylative activity of Sc-RppA. It was also noteworthy that the decarboxylative activities of both the C138A and C138S mutants were significantly higher than WT enzyme. Approximately, 24 and 75% of the malonyl-CoA substrate was converted to the terminal metabolite acetyl-CoA in the C138A and C138S mutant forms of Sc-RppA, respectively. A similar observation was reported previously in the C138A and C138S mutant forms of DpgA (23Tseng C.C. McLoughlin S.M. Kelleher N.L. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 970-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Next, using acetoacetyl-CoA or acetyl-CoA as the starter substrate and malonyl-CoA as the extender unit, we observed that all Tyr224 mutants (except for the negative controls C138A and C138S) were able to produce TAL from either acetoacetyl-CoA or acetyl-CoA (Fig. 4A) via intramolecular lactonization of the triketide linear chain elongation intermediate (Fig. 1B). The mutants with partial ability to generate THN produced significantly higher levels of TAL from either acetoacetyl-CoA or acetyl-CoA compared with WT Sc-RppA. We surmise that this was a result of the decreased loading efficiency of malonyl-CoA as a starter unit, resulting in a greater propensity for loading of alternative acyl-CoAs due to increased availability of the active site toward unnatural substrates. Moreover, these partially active Tyr224 mutants still accumulated THN, leading to a production profile similar to that shown in Fig. 3A (data not shown), although the corresponding yields were lower because of competition of unnatural acyl-CoA against malonyl-CoA as starter unit. More importantly, the inactive Tyr224 mutants including Y224H, Y224S, and Y224G were capable of accepting acetoacetyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, resulting in a substantial accumulation of TAL with an incorporation rate ranging from 41 to 71% and 2 to 5% for acetoacetyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, respectively. It was evident that the incorporation rate of acetoacetyl-CoA (41–85%) was significantly higher than acetyl-CoA (2–25%). For instance, by calculating the absolute yield of TAL using authentic material as a standard, we determined that 52% of acetoacetyl-CoA was converted to TAL by WT Sc-RppA, whereas only 5% of acetyl-CoA was found to be incorporated as TAL product (similar results were also observed in Sg-RppA (24Funa N. Ohnishi Y. Ebizuka Y. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4628-4635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and PhlD (32Zha W. Rubin-Pitel S.B. Zhao H. J. Biol.

Finally, when we utilized hexanoyl-CoA or benzoyl-CoA as alternate starter units, the corresponding product profiles were comparable with those of acetoacetyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA generated by different Sc-RppAs (Fig. 4). Specifically, the products hexanoyl triketide pyrone 3 and benzoyl triketide pyrone 4 of Y224F, Y224L, Y224M, Y224C, and Y224A were observed in significantly higher amounts. With respect to the inactive Tyr224 mutants (Y224H, Y224S, Y224G), we demonstrated that they are also capable of synthesizing the corresponding triketide pyrones from hexanoyl-CoA and benzoyl-CoA, albeit at relatively low levels. In this analysis, however, we were not able to determine the incorporation rates due to lack of standard compounds. Steady-state Kinetics of RppAs—The HPLC-based product profile analysis only provided qualitative information on the activities of Tyr224 mutants. To better understand the effect of each mutation, steady-state kinetic parameters based on overall THN formation of WT Sc-RppA and the Tyr224 mutants were determined (Table 1). The kinetics of WT Sc-RppA (kcat = 1.33 ± 0.05 min-1, Km = 3.9 ± 0.5 μm, kcat/Km ="

This approach allowed the precise identification of the interacting genomic fragments, one of which is resistant to micrococcal nuclease cleavage. The interacting fragments form a single transcriptional control unit, as indicated by their common protein content. Furthermore, we show that the enhancer-MP interaction persists during the early stages of transcription and is lost upon α-amanitin treatment, indicating the requirement for active transcription.

Transcription regulation in eukaryotic cells is a multistep process that involves the assembly of multiprotein complexes on gene regulatory regions (1Lemon B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2551-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). These regulatory regions contain two types of sequences: enhancers/silencers, which recruit a complex array of transcription factors and chromatin-modifying activities, and core promoter elements to which the general transcriptional machinery, including RNAP II, 2The abbreviations used are: RNAP II, RNA polymerase II; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; MNase, micrococcal nuclease; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; ChIP-ready chromatin, cross-linked sonicated chromatin; DAF, distinctive amplification fragment; CTD, C-terminal domain of RNAP II; CTD-P-S2/S5, C-terminal domain phosphorylated in serine 2/serine 5; HMGN1/2, high mobility group protein N1/N2; MP, minimal promoter; IVS, intervening sequence. is recruited. Understanding the molecular mechanism(s) involved in transcriptional regulation over long distances is of fundamental importance, because in most cases the activities of remote control elements are essential in turning on or off specific subsets of genes in a temporally and spatially regulated manner (2Li Q. Harju S. Peterson K.R. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 403-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The main models to explain distal enhancer function invoke enhancer-promoter communication, either through protein-protein interactions resulting in the formation of DNA/chromatin loops (looping model), the free sliding of proteins recruited on the enhancer along the DNA (scanning model), or the establishment of modified chromatin domains between the enhancer and the promoter by facilitator proteins, which generate a progressive chain of higher order complexes along the chromatin fiber (3Ptashne M.

The interaction between enhancer elements and proximal promoter culminates in the transcription activation event. However it is not yet clarified if the activation of transcription stems from the transient interaction of regulatory elements or through a more stable structure working as a single control unit. The uPA gene codes for a serine protease involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix and in cell motility (16Mondino A. Blasi F. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 450-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The expression of this gene is normally dependent on the presence of inducers, but in cancer cells it is often constitutive. The regulatory region of the uPA gene contains an MP and an enhancer located 2 kb upstream (17Verde P. Boast S. Franzè A. Robbiati F. Blasi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10699-10716Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In highly invasive human prostate adenocarcinoma (PC3) cells this gene is constitutively expressed (18Ibañez-Tallon I. Ferrai C. Longobardi E. Facetti I. Blasi F. Crippa M.P.

In an attempt to obtain new insights into the molecular mechanism involved in enhancer-mediated gene activation, we asked if specific DNA fragments in the enhancer and MP of the uPA gene were involved in the interaction between the regulatory elements by using a modified chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) approach, including an MNase digestion step prior to immunoprecipitation. This procedure allows the fine mapping of DNA sequences involved in these interactions, while maintaining the information content on their protein composition. Here we provide experimental evidences for the presence of specific structures in the MP region of the uPA gene that are associated with transcriptional events and for the interaction of one of them with the enhancer. Our results support a model of interaction between the regulatory regions that persists at least through the early steps of elongation. Cell Cultures, α-Amanitin Treatment, and Chromatin Preparation—PC3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing a final concentration of 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 0.2 mg/ml streptomycin, 20 units/ml penicillin, 2 mm glutamine, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. α-Amanitin (Sigma) was dissolved in water, and increasing concentrations were added to the culture medium for 24 h, as previously described (26Casse C. Giannoni F. Nguyen V.T. Dubois M.F. Bensaude O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16097-16106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Inhibition of uPA transcription was estimated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR of uPA mRNA at different α-amanitin concentrations. At 10 μg/ml uPA transcription was inhibited by >90%; this concentration was used in further experiments as follows. Untreated cells or cells that were treated with α-amanitin (10 μg/ml for 24 h) were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min, and chromatin was prepared essentially as described (27Orlando V. Strutt H. Paro R. Methods. 1997; 11: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) by using 10 sonication cycles (35 s at 60–70 watts, in an Ultrasonic Processor XL Sonicator (Miosonix), followed by a 2-min rest on ice). Cross-linked chromatin-containing fractions were pooled and stored at –80 °C. Cross-linked chromatin was prepared from different batches of PC3 cells (two batches of untreated and two batches of α-amanitin-treated) PC3 cells. All experiments (e.g. MNase digestion and ChIP) were repeated at least twice for each batch. RNA Detection—Total RNA was extracted with an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), quantitated by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop), and 5 μg was reverse-transcribed using a SuperScript™ First-Strand kit using random primers (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, 5 ng of reverse-transcribed RNA were amplified, and the amplification products were detected using the TaqMan gene expression assay (Hs00170182_m1) primers and probes specific for uPA, in an ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System. 18 S rRNA gene levels were examined and used to normalize the results (TaqMan gene expression assay 4319413E). To check for the presence of RNA in the enhancer and coding regions, total RNA was extracted from untreated cells, reverse transcribed as above, and 5, 10, and 20 ng of reverse transcribed products were amplified with primers corresponding to different sections of the enhancer and coding region of uPA. The PCR reaction (see below) was performed with 40 amplification cycles. Primer sequences, location with respect to the uPA sequence (17Verde P. Boast S. Franzè A. Robbiati F. Blasi F.

MNase digestions were performed in bulk by adding CaCl2 to a final concentration of 2 mm and MNase (2 units/ml, Sigma) and incubating at 37 °C. Aliquots (1 ml) were withdrawn from the digestion mixture at each time point and directly added to the digestion stop solution (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). Digested chromatin was treated with proteinase K (500 μg/ml) for 5 h at 37 °C, cross-links were reverted by heating overnight at 65 °C, and the DNA was purified using phenol extraction and resuspended in distilled water. The DNA was then treated with RNase A (50 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, again with proteinase K (500 μg/ml) for 5 h at 55 °C, phenol-extracted, and precipitated. For the experiments shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 6, the DNA was resuspended in distilled water and quantitated at the spectrophotometer (A260), and equal amounts (100 ng) of material, for each time point, were used as template in PCR reactions.FIGURE 3Detection and characterization of DAF amplicons in the MP region of the uPA gene.

The resulting material was used directly in ChIP assays. ChIP—Each aliquot of MNase-digested cross-linked chromatin (200 μg) was precleared with 25 μl of Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), previously coated with 10 μg/ml each of poly(dI-dC), poly(dG-dC), and poly(dA-dT) and with 100 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The aliquots were then incubated overnight with 1 μg of the appropriate antibodies (or without antibodies for the mock controls) in a total volume of 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and immunoprecipitated as described (27Orlando V. Strutt H. Paro R. Methods. 1997; 11: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Following immunoprecipitation, the material was treated with RNase A (50 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C and by proteinase K (500 μg/ml) in 0.5% SDS at the same temperature overnight. Formaldehyde cross-links were reverted by heating the samples at 65 °C for 5 h, and the DNA was purified with phenol extraction and then resuspended in 250 μl of distilled water. Resuspended material (4 μl) was used as a template in PCR reactions. PCRs were performed as follows: (a) first denaturation 1: 95 °C for 3 min; second denaturation: 95 °C, 1 min; annealing step (see Table 1 for temperatures of the primer sets), 1 min; extension: 72 °C, 1 min; final extension: 72 °C, 3 min. The second denaturation, annealing, and extension steps were normally repeated for 33 cycles. To exclude the presence of a signal from other immunoprecipitated material, the number of cycles in the PCR reactions was raised to 40. Primer sequences, location with respect to the uPA sequence (17Verde P. Boast S. Franzè A. Robbiati F. Blasi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10699-10716Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and annealing temperatures for each primer set are reported in Table 1. For the amplification of the 1574-bp genomic fragment shown in Fig. 1 (primers F14/R26) an elongation step of 2 min was used. PCR products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels in 0.5× TBE buffer. (45 mm Tris-borate; 1 mm EDTA, pH 7) The specific antibodies used for immunoprecipitations were against the following modifications of histone H3: K4me2 or K9me2 (#07–030 or #07–352, respectively, Upstate Biotechnology); K14ac or K9ac (#07–353 or #07–352, respectively, Upstate Biotechnology). The nomenclature of histone H3 post-translational modifications is according to a previous study (28Turner B.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 110-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Anti-HMGN1 and -HMGN2 antibodies were a kind gift of Dr. Michael Bustin, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. Polyclonal antibodies against c-Jun (sc-1694X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and monoclonal antibodies against CTD-P-S2 (MMS-129-RA, Covance) or CTD-P-S2 (MMS-134-RA, Covance) were also used. In all experiments, polyclonal antibodies against the uPA receptor produced in our laboratory were used as unrelated antibodies. In all the experiments investigating the protein composition of MNase-digested chromatin, material from the same immunoprecipitation was amplified with primers located in the enhancer and minimal promoter regions as indicated in the individual figures. Anti-Sp1 or -p300 Antibodies Immunoprecipitate the uPA MP and Enhancer Sequences—Formaldehyde cross-links molecules with reactive groups at a maximum distance of 2 Å. This may occur between proteins bound to distant regulatory elements, if such groups are close enough, implying their interaction. We tested this hypothesis for the MP and the enhancer of the uPA gene, located 2 kb upstream, by performing conventional ChIP experiments on cross-linked, sonicated chromatin from PC3 cells with antibodies against Sp1, which uniquely binds the MP (18Ibañez-Tallon I.

We asked if the DNA immunoprecipitated with one or the other antibody contained both enhancer and MP sequences, by amplifying the recovered material with specific primers (F5/R14 and F27/R31 in Fig. 1A). Indeed both genomic DNA sequences were immunoprecipitated with either antibody, whereas the IVS was not detected (Fig. 1B) even by increasing the number of PCR cycles. Thus, the results are consistent with a close physical proximity of the regulatory elements and the extrusion of the IVS. However, amplification of the input DNA with the F14/R26 primer set did show the presence of a PCR product (Fig. 1B), indicating that the IVS was not fully broken by sonication. To obtain independent evidence of the interaction of the two separate genomic fragments we enzymatically cleaved chromatin prior to immunoprecipitation. ChIP-ready Chromatin Is Accessible to MNase Cleavage—We chose to digest ChIP-ready chromatin with MNase, a processive enzyme widely employed in chromatin studies (29Turner B.M. Chromatin and Gene Regulation. Molecular Mechanisms in Epigenetics. Blackwell Science Ltd., Oxford, UK2001Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 30van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1989Crossref Google Scholar). The pattern of MNase digestion obtained in a time-course experiment shows that ChIP-ready chromatin from PC3 cells was readily and increasingly cleaved by the enzyme to poly-, mono-, and sub-nucleosomal particles (Fig. 2A). Next, genomic DNA from the various digestion time-points of Fig. 2A was subjected to PCR reactions with sets of primers that amplified increasingly larger (from 145 to 250 bp) fragments in the uPA enhancer region (Fig. 2B). The results showed that only nucleosome-size genomic fragments could be amplified using material from all the digestion time points (Fig. 2C), thus confirming the accessibility to and the cleavage by MNase of the uPA enhancer region. PCR Reactions with Genomic DNA from MNase-digested ChIP-ready Chromatin Reveal Fragments with a Distinctive Amplification Pattern in the MP Region—We then repeated the PCR amplification using primer sets in the uPA MP region. Because we wanted to exclude the presence of genomic fragments larger than 200 bp (mononucleosome size), we deliberately designed two sets of primers spanning 464 bp and 320 bp, respectively, and expected to be able to amplify genomic DNA only by using material from the early digestion time points (see Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 3B, primer sets F22/R26 and F26/R31 showed that the amplification signal decreased by using genomic DNA from early and intermediate MNase digestion time points but was rescued with material from later (20 and 50 min) time points. However, the amplification of two fragments of similar size upstream of F22 and one in the enhancer region displayed the progressive loss of the PCR signal, as expected (data not shown). Amplicons F22/R26 and F26/R31 share a common primer (F/R26 in Fig. 3A); however, they displayed the lowest amplification signal at different time points. We asked if they belonged to the same or different genomic populations by amplifying the region spanning both fragments (using primers F22 and R31 in Fig. 3A). In this case the amplification signal decreased with increasing digestion time (Fig. 3C). Thus amplicons F22/R26 and F26/R31, specifically located at and upstream of the MP region of the uPA gene, belong to different DNA fragments. Because F22/R26 and F26/R31 amplicons have a distinctive amplification pattern they were named DAF-A and DAF-B, respectively. The amplification pattern of DAF-A and -B apparently contradicts the MNase digestion kinetics and the results obtained in the enhancer region, shown in Fig. 2. However, one must recall that MNase is a processive endonuclease (30van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1989Crossref Google Scholar), and this mode of action has two main consequences: 1) it causes a progressive and generalized loss of genomic DNA, as indicated by the quantitation of the material recovered at each MNase digestion time point (supplemental Fig. S1C). 2) It enriches genomic fragments that originate from a chromatin population that is more resistant to MNase cleavage than bulk chromatin, whereas it rapidly degrades those from a chromatin population more sensitive to cleavage than bulk chromatin. We therefore speculated that DAF-A, -B, and -Bx originate from such resistant populations. Thus we performed Southern blot experiments to test this point. Overall the results (shown in supplemental Fig. S1) indicated that: 1) both the enhancer and DAF-A regions are more sensitive than bulk chromatin to severing treatments; 2) at early digestion time points mono- and subnucleosomes from DAF-A accumulate more slowly than those form the enhancer region; and 3) DAF-A can only be revealed by the amplification provided by PCR and not by probing a Southern blot. The two latter observations indicate that DAF-A originates from a small, severing-resistant subpopulation of chromatin of the uPA regulatory region. Defining the Borders of DAF-A and DAF-B—Because DAF-A and DAF-B represent different chromatin populations we next established their size by amplifying increasingly longer fragments, assuming that the amplification pattern of amplicons F22/R26 and F26/R31 would be maintained if longer fragments belonged to the same chromatin populations. Indeed we could extend the amplification pattern of DAF-B in the 3′ direction (Fig. 4B), using primers R34 and R36, but not R37, in combination with F26. However, by using primer F25 in combination with R31 the pattern of amplicon DAF-B was lost in the 5′ direction (Fig. 4B). Thus DAF-B could be extended to the untranslated portion of the second exon of the uPA gene (Fig. 4A and Ref. 31Riccio A. Grimaldi G. Verde P. Sebastio G. Boast S. Blasi F.

https://openalex.org/W2115243233,"A long standing controversy is whether an alternating activesite mechanism occurs during catalysis in thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzymes. We address this question by investigating the ThDP-dependent decarboxylase/dehydrogenase (E1b) component of the mitochondrial branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC). Our crystal structure reveals that conformations of the two active sites in the human E1b heterotetramer harboring the reaction intermediate are identical. Acidic residues in the core of the E1b heterotetramer, which align with the proton-wire residues proposed to participate in active-site communication in the related pyruvate dehydrogenase from Bacillus stearothermophilus, are mutated. Enzyme kinetic data show that, except in a few cases because of protein misfolding, these alterations are largely without effect on overall activity of BCKDC, ruling out the requirement of a proton-relay mechanism in E1b. BCKDC overall activity is nullified at 50% phosphorylation of E1b, but it is restored to nearly half of the pre-phosphorylation level after dissociation and reconstitution of BCKDC with the same phosphorylated E1b. The results suggest that the abolition of overall activity likely results from the specific geometry of the half-phosphorylated E1b in the BCKDC assembly and not due to a disruption of the alternating active-site mechanism. Finally, we show that a mutant E1b containing only one functional active site exhibits half of the wild-type BCKDC activity, which directly argues against the obligatory communication between active sites. The above results provide evidence that the two active sites in the E1b heterotetramer operate independently during the ThDP-dependent decarboxylation reaction.

ThDP-dependent enzymes in the form of homodimers (α2), homotetramers (α4), or heterotetramers (α2β2) contain ThDP-binding pockets that constitute the two or four active sites of these enzymes. A long standing controversy in the literature has been whether these multiple active sites in a ThDP-dependent enzyme communicate with each other to affect the enzymatic reaction. An alternating active-site mechanism, or half-of-the-sites reactivity, was proposed, based on the negative cooperativity of ThDP binding to apo-transketolase (4Kochetov G.A. Meshalkina L.E. Usmanov R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 5Egan R.M. Sable H.Z. J. Biol.

However, the crystal structure of the α-carbanion of (α,β-dihydroxyethyl)thiamine diphosphate in the active sites of yeast transketolase shows that the intermediate is present in high occupancy in both active sites, which does not support the alternating active-site mechanism in this enzyme (8Fiedler E. Thorell S. Sandalova T. Golbik R. Konig S. Schneider G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Yeast pyruvate decarboxylase, an α4-type ThDP-dependent enzyme, was shown kinetically to have two distinct pairs of active sites that alternate during the decarboxylation reaction (9Sergienko E.A. Jordan F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6164-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This kinetic model is supported by the observation that two of the four active sites of yeast pyruvate decarboxylase bind the nonmetabolizable substrate analog pyruvamide and assume a closed conformation in the crystal structure (10Lu G. Dobritzsch D. Baumann S. Schneider G. Konig S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Alternating active sites have also been described for bacterial benzoylformate decarboxylase, according to the spectroscopic detection of transient ThDP-bound intermediates (11Sergienko E.A. Wang J.

The mitochondrial α-keto acid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes, comprising the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, and the branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDC), catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of α-keto acids (Reaction 1) for energy production through the Krebs cycle (12Reed L.J.

The lipoyl-bearing domain (LBD) of the E2 core imparts substrate channeling by sequentially visiting different active sites in each of the three E1, E2, and E3 catalytic components (14Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), leading to the oxidative decarboxylation of α-keto acids (Reaction 1). The E1 components of α-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes are ThDP-dependent enzymes that catalyze both the ThDP-dependent decarboxylation of α-keto acids to produce the α-carbanion-ThDP intermediate (Reaction 2) and the reductive acylation of oxidized lipoylated LBD (lip-LBD-S2) on E2, forming S-acyldihydrolipoamide (Reaction 3).R-CO-COOH+E1-ThDP→E1-[R-COH=ThDP]+CO2↑REACTION2REACTION 2 E1-[R-COH=ThDP]+E2-[lipLBD-S2]→E2-[R-CO-S-lipLBD-SH]+E1-ThDPREACTION3REACTION 3 The E1p component of the mammalian and Gram-positive bacterial PDC belongs to the α2β2-type of ThDP-dependent enzymes with two active sites; each of these active sites catalyzes both Reaction 2 and Reaction 3. The half-of-the-sites reactivity or the alternating active-site mechanism was suggested to function in the E1p component of the pig heart PDC (15Sugden P.H. Randle P.J. Biochem. J. 1978; 173: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This model was prompted by the observation that the phosphorylation of the complex corresponding to a molar ratio of one phosphate group per two α chains, i.e. one phosphoryl group per α2β2 heterotetramer, results in the complete inactivation of the PDC. Likewise, phosphorylation of half of the available sites in the α2β2 heterotetramer of the related E1b component inactivates reconstituted BCKDC (16Wynn R.M. Kato M. Machius M. Chuang J.L. Li J. Tomchick D.R. Chuang D.T. Structure (Lond.). 2004; 12: 2185-2196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the thesis that the alternating active-site mechanism occurs in the E1p or E1b component. Thus, the inactivation of one of the two active sites disrupts this mode of action, resulting in the inactivation of the mammalian PDC or BCKDC. A model for the communication between the two active sites of the E1p component of the Bacillus stearothermophilus PDC has been described, in which a proton is reversibly shuttling through an acidic channel in the protein (17Frank R.A. Titman C.M. Pratap J.V. Luisi B.F. Perham R.N. Science. 2004; 306: 872-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The authors suggested that this proton wire allows the cofactors to function as a general acid/base catalyst to switch the conformation of the active-site loops. It is further hypothesized that this proton-relay mechanism may extend to other dimeric ThDP-dependent enzymes, in particular, those requiring an activated cofactor for catalysis. Chemical nonequivalence in the two active sites of the E1p component of human PDC has recently been demonstrated in the forms of ThDP C2 ionization rate, the ability to bind a substrate analog, and the decarboxylation rate constant of the 2-lactyl-ThDP intermediate (18Seifert F. Golbik R. Brauer J. Lilie H. Schroder-Tittmann K. Hinze E. Korotchkina L.G. Patel M.S. Tittmann K. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12775-12785Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the half-of-the-sites reactivity but shed no light on whether the proton-wire mechanism described for the B. stearothermophilus E1p (17Frank R.A. Titman C.M. Pratap J.V. Luisi B.F. Perham R.N. Science. 2004; 306: 872-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) is responsible for the observed chemical nonequivalence between the two active sites in human E1p. We have previously described crystal structures of wild-type and mutant human E1b in the absence and presence of decarboxylation reaction intermediates (16Wynn R.M. Kato M. Machius M. Chuang J.L.

For these structure determinations, we used a crystal form that has an αβ′ heterodimer in the asymmetric unit and exhibited the symmetry of space group P3121. The full heterotetramer is generated by a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry operator. This symmetry persists to the observed high resolution limit (1.4 Å) of these crystals. As a result of this packing arrangement, the two half-tetramers must be structurally identical. The electron densities showed that both active sites are occupied with intermediates. We did not detect any structural asymmetry involving the active sites or surrounding regions, either for human E1b in the absence of substrate or when intermediates were bound. Likewise, the crystal structure of the E1b component from Thermus thermophilus BCKDC showed similar occupancy of the α-carbanion-ThDP intermediate in both active sites (23Nakai T. Nakagawa N. Maoka N. Masui R. Kuramitsu S. Kamiya N. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 237: 1011-1033Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, these crystallographic properties of both human and Thermus E1bs are inconsistent with the half-of-the-sites model for these ThDP-dependent enzymes. To investigate whether the alternating active-site mechanism occurs in the ThDP-dependent E1b component of human BCKDC, we carried out crystallographic and biochemical studies with both wild-type and mutant E1b heterotetramers. We provide evidence that the two active sites in human E1b, unlike B. stearothermophilus and human E1p, can operate independently without the obligatory communication between active sites. Moreover, we find that the completely inactive BCKDC, harboring 50% phosphorylated E1b, regains a significant amount of overall activity when the covalently modified E1b is dissociated and re-associated with E2b. We suggest that the inactive BCKDC observed with the phosphorylated E1b results from the specific geometry associated with the BCKDC assembly. Protein Expression and Purification—N-terminally and C-terminally His6-tagged wild-type and mutant human E1b proteins were generated as described previously (20Li J. Wynn R.M. Machius M. Chuang J.L.

The mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit provided by Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Expression of C-terminally His6-tagged LBD (residues 1–84 of the human E2b subunit) and in vitro lipoylation was carried out also as described previously (24Chuang J.L. Davie J.R. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 192-200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To produce an E1b-hybrid protein with only one functional active site, two plasmids were constructed. The pHisT hE1b plasmid containing the N-terminally His6-tagged S292Qα subunit and the nontagged wild-type β subunit coding regions were as described previously (16Wynn R.M. Kato M. Machius M. Chuang J.L. Li J. Tomchick D.R. Chuang D.T. Structure (Lond.). 2004; 12: 2185-2196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The pStrep hE1b plasmid was derived from the pACYCDuet-1 plasmid (Novagen, San Diego) with the mature E1bα and E1bβ coding sequences, both of the wild type, inserted into its two multiple cloning sites. The Strep tag contained a short sequence of eight amino acid residues (WSHPQFEK) that allowed binding to Strep-Tactin resin (IBA GmbH, Göttingen, Germany). The pHisT hE1b and pStrep hE1b plasmids were co-transformed into BL-21 cells; the cells were selected against both ampicillin and chloramphenicol. The hybrid E1b protein (S292Qα/WT-α)β2, consisting of one His6-tagged mutant α subunit and one Strep-tagged wild-type subunit, was purified from the lysate of co-transformed BL-21 cells by consecutive use of the HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) connected to an FPLC system and the Strep-Tactin Superflow gravity column. Elution conditions were chosen based on control experiments with His6-tagged E1b (with both α subunits carrying the His6 tag) on a Strep-Tactin column, and with Strep-tagged E1b (with both α subunits bearing the Strep tag) on a HisTrap column to avoid possible contamination by the carryover of single tagged species. X-ray Crystallography of Mutant Human E1b Proteins—Crystallization of the C-terminally His6-tagged human S302Pα E1b protein was carried out as described previously (22Machius M. Wynn R.M. Chuang J.L.

The crystals exhibited the symmetry of space group P3221 with cell parameters of approximately a = b = 145 Å and c = 138 Å, contained an entire heterotetramer per asymmetric unit, and diffracted x-rays to a minimum Bragg spacing, dmin, of 1.88 Å. This crystal form is related to a previously published crystal form that exhibited the symmetry of space group P3121 with cell parameters of approximately a = b = 145 Å and c = 69 Å and that contained an α/β′ heterodimer per asymmetric unit (22Machius M.

Data were processed with the HKL2000 package (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The crystal structure was determined by molecular replacement using the program Phaser (27McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Refinement was carried out with the program Refmac5 (28Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol.

No noncrystallographic symmetry restraints or constraints were used during refinement. Manual adjustments to the models were carried out with the program Coot (30Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23624) Google Scholar). The electron density clearly showed the presence of 2-(α-hydroxyisobutyl)-ThDP (VThDP), the decarboxylation intermediate from α-ketoisovalerate (KIV) in both active sites of the human E1b heterotetramer. A model for this intermediate was included only at the very end of the modeling/refinement process. After the refinement of the protein portions was complete, solvent molecules were added where chemically reasonable. Ramachandran analysis shows that all but 2 out of 1,439 residues in the model fall into the allowed regions. Tyr-113α in both copies in the asymmetric unit is in the disallowed region. The electron density for these residues is well defined. Tyr-113α adopts a unique conformation (referred to as the P-conformation) after a decarboxylation reaction intermediate has been formed in the active sites as described previously (22Machius M.

Each E1b has a final concentration of 5.8 μm, which was used to normalize the scans. Final traces were produced after subtraction of the reference scan and subsequent base-line corrections to determine the melting temperature (Tm) using the MicroCal ORIGIN 7 software package. Phosphorylation of E1b and Dissociation of E1b from E2b after Phosphorylation—Phosphorylation of S302Aα E1b with the BCKD kinase was carried out in the presence of E2b as described previously (20Li J. Wynn R.M. Machius M. Chuang J.L. Karthikeyan S. Tomchick D.R. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32968-32978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Aliquots were taken from the reaction mixture at different time points and mixed with 0.5 mm EDTA and the SDS sample loading buffer, followed by analysis by SDS-PAGE. The amount of 32P-phosphoryl group incorporated into the E1bα subunit was determined by PhosphorImaging. The calculation was done by comparing the individual PhosphorImaging bands to a band from standard spotting. To resolve E1b, E2b, and the BCKD kinase proteins after phosphorylation, NaCl was added to the reaction mixture to a final concentration of 1.0 m. After incubation overnight at 4 °C, the mixture was concentrated, and E1b was separated from E2b and the BCKD kinase by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 (HR 10/30) column. Western Blotting—Column fractions containing His6-tagged E1b, Strep-tagged E1b, and His6/Strep-tagged hybrid E1b proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 12% gels; protein bands were transferred to the Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Bellerica, MA). The protein bands were probed following the manufacturers' protocol, with either the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated His6 tag probe supplied by Pierce or the horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated Strep probe (Strep-Tactin) provided by IBA GmbH (Göttingen, Germany). The Presence of Two Identical Active-site Conformations in Human E1b—We have determined the crystal structure of human E1b in the presence of 2-(α-hydroxyisobutyl)-ThDP (VThDP), the decarboxylation intermediate from the substrate α-ketoisovalerate (KIV), in a novel crystal form that contains an entire human E1b heterotetramer in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 1). This crystal form was obtained with a human E1b variant (S302Pα) harboring a substitution at phosphorylation site 2 (Ser-302α). The mutation appears to lead to a small structural change in the phosphorylation loop, which alters the intermolecular interactions in this region and results in a new packing arrangement in the crystals, which is different from that reported previously for human E1b (16Wynn R.M.

Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. Noncrystallographic symmetry was not imposed during the refinement. The results show no structural asymmetry between the αβ′ and the α′β heterodimers; the root-mean-square deviation for all compared 711 C-α atoms is 0.17 Å. The two active sites and their neighboring regions are structurally virtually identical. The B factor for the cabanion-ThDP intermediate in both active sites is 11.8 Å2, compared with the average of 16.8 Å2. When this heterotetramer is compared with the one generated from the previously reported heterodimeric structure (Protein Data Bank code 2beu) based on crystallographic 2-fold symmetry, the resulting root-mean-square deviation for all 1422 compared C-α carbon atoms is 0.24 Å. Thus, the structures of human E1b in the presence of the intermediate VThDP are virtually identical, irrespective of whether an αβ′ heterodimer (22Machius M. Wynn R.M. Chuang J.L. Li J. Kluger R.

Taken together, there is no crystallographic evidence for a structural asymmetry between the two active sites in human E1b. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Candidate Proton-wire Residues in E1b—Fig. 2A shows the alignment of the potential proton-wire residues among sequences from human E1b, Pseudomonas putida E1b, human E1p, and B. stearothermophilus E1p. In human E1b, these residues include Asp-200α, Glu-46β, Glu-76β, and Asp-108β. These residues are located in a channel between the two symmetrical E1b active sites, each showing good density for the occupied VThDP intermediate (Fig. 2B). Glu-198α is a candidate proton-wire residue in human E1b, but the equivalent Gln-178α in B. stearothermophilus E1p has not been implicated as a proton-wire residue (17Frank R.A. Titman C.M. Pratap J.V. Luisi B.F. Perham R.N. Science. 2004; 306: 872-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Ala-203α in human E1b aligns with the proton-wire residue Glu-183α of B. stearothermophilus E1p, but it cannot assume the putative function because of the absence of negative charges. Moreover, there is no magnesium ion present in the center of the channel, unlike in B. stearothermophilus E1p. There is also no residue equivalent to this magnesium ion that could fulfill its role. Instead, there is a pair of Gln-77β residues"

Sequestration of reduced NifL to the cytoplasmic membrane under anaerobic and nitrogen-limited conditions impairs inhibition of cytoplasmic NifA by NifL. To analyze whether NifL is reduced by electrons directly derived from the reduced menaquinone pool, we studied NifL reduction using artificial membrane systems containing purified components of the anaerobic respiratory chain of Wolinella succinogenes. In this in vitro assay using proteoliposomes containing purified formate dehydrogenase and purified menaquinone (MK6) or 8-methylmenaquinone (MMK6) from W. succinogenes, reduction of purified NifL was achieved by formate oxidation. Furthermore, the respective reduction rates, which were determined using equal amounts of NifL, have been shown to be directly dependent on the concentration of both formate dehydrogenase and menaquinones incorporated into the proteoliposomes, demonstrating a direct electron transfer from menaquinone to NifL. When purified hydrogenase and MK6 from W. succinogenes were inserted into the proteoliposomes, NifL was reduced with nearly the same rate by hydrogen oxidation. In both cases reduced NifL was found to be highly associated to the proteoliposomes, which is in accordance with our previous findings in vivo. On the bases of these experiments, we propose that the redox state of the menaquinone pool is the redox signal for nif regulation in K. pneumoniae by directly transferring electrons onto NifL under anaerobic conditions.

In the free living nitrogen fixing Klebsiella pneumoniae transcription of the nitrogen fixation (nif) genes is strictly regulated in response to external oxygen and combined nitrogen. Under nitrogen- and oxygen-limiting conditions, transcription of nif genes is mediated by the activator protein NifA in combination with the alternative σ54-RNA polymerase (1Hoover T.R. Santero E.

However, in the presence of molecular oxygen and/or ammonium NifA, transcriptional activity is inhibited by a second regulatory protein, NifL (4Merrick M. Hill S. Hennecke H. Hahn M. Dixon R.

This inhibition of NifA activity by NifL occurs via direct protein-protein interaction in K. pneumoniae, which was first implied by co-immunoprecipitation studies (8Henderson N. Austin S. Dixon R.

A direct protein interaction between NifL and NifA is further consistent with yeast two-hybrid studies and in vitro analysis of complex formation between NifL and NifA from Azotobacter vinelandii, which also regulates its nif gene expression by the two regulatory proteins (10Money T.

By analyzing in vivo complex formation between NifA and NifL, we have recently demonstrated that sequestration of the inhibitor NifL to the cytoplasmic membrane under nitrogen and simultaneous oxygen limitation (derepressing conditions) is the key mechanism for regulating cytoplasmic NifA activity in K. pneumoniae by NifL (9Stips J.

We further showed that NifL sequestration to the cytoplasmic membrane is directly dependent on the reduction of its FAD cofactor under anaerobic and nitrogen limitation conditions (9Stips J.

In contrast to A. vinelandii, the relief of NifL inhibition in K. pneumoniae under nitrogen limitation depends on the interaction with modified GlnK (23He L. Soupene E. Ninfa A. Kustu S. J.

We have recently shown that GlnK effects the cellular localization of NifL in response to nitrogen limitation by direct protein interaction with the inhibitory NifL·NifA complex, resulting in complex dissociation (9Stips J. Thummer R. Neumann M. Schmitz R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3379-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) followed by NifL sequestration to the cytoplasmic membrane when oxygen is simultaneously limiting (21Klopprogge K. Grabbe R. Hoppert M. Schmitz R.A. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 177: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1).Recent genetic studies strongly suggest that the electrons, which are responsible for FAD reduction, are derived from the anaerobic respiratory chain of K. pneumoniae via the reduced quinone pool (22Grabbe R. Schmitz R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 33Grabbe R. Klopprogge K. Schmitz R.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To obtain further evidence, we established an in vitro system to reduce purified NifL using proteoliposomes containing purified components of the anaerobic respiratory chain of the anaerobic rumen bacterium Wolinella succinogenes (formate dehydrogenase, hydrogenase, and menaquinones) (34Dietrich W. Klimmek O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1086-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Studying NifL reduction using this artificial membrane system and the respective electron donors (formate, hydrogen), we achieved strong evidence (i) that under anaerobic conditions electrons are directly transferred from the reduced menaquinone pool in the membrane onto NifL-bound FAD and (ii) that the requirement for any further K. pneumoniae-specific protein potentially interacting with NifL, such as a specific oxidoreductase or a NifL-specific receptor protein in the cytoplasmic membrane, can be excluded.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains—The bacterial strain used in this work was K. pneumoniae M5al (wild type) containing pJES794 (35Narberhaus F. Lee H.S. Schmitz R.A. He L. Kustu S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5078-5087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which carries malE-nifL under the control of the tac promoter.Purification and Reconstitution of the FAD Cofactor of MBP-NifL—MBP-NifL was synthesized at 30 °C in maximal induction medium (36Ow D.W.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5078-5087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of fusion protein was induced from the tac promoter for 4 h with 100 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 19 °C when cultures reached a turbidity of A600 = 0.6. After disruption of cells in breakage (B) buffer and centrifugation at 20,000 × g, fusion proteins were purified from the supernatant by amylose affinity chromatography (16Schmitz R.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 157: 313-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To reconstitute the fraction of apoflavoprotein, the method was modified in a way that a solution of 10 mm FAD in B-buffer was added to matrix-immobilized MBP-NifL and circulated over the column for 15 h at 4 °C (Fig. 2A) before the elution of MBP-NifL.FIGURE 2Reconstitution of immobilized MBP-NifL with FAD. MBP-NifL was expressed in K. pneumoniae and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, MBP-NifL of the cell extracts was immobilized to the affinity chromatography matrix; subsequently a 10 mm FAD solution was added and circulated over the column for 15 h at 4 °C, yielding in a 100% reconstitution of the FAD-cofactor of MBP-NifL.

Initially the redox spectra of these samples were monitored, and the differences of absorbance at 452 nm were determined (ΔE452–600 nm) for each sample. Subsequently, the FAD cofactor of the respective MBP-NifL fractions was extracted with trichloroacetic acid as recently described (16Schmitz R.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 157: 313-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the amounts of extracted FAD were calculated by fluorescent quantification (excitation at 465 nm and monitoring emission at 520 nm) using FAD solutions in B-buffer containing 5% trichloroacetic acid as standards. The absorbance difference (ΔE452–600 nm) obtained from the redox spectra and the respective amount of extracted FAD were used to calculate the molar extinction coefficient that was determined to be ϵ452–600 nm = 6.63 mm– × cm–. Using this molar extinction coefficient, the FAD content of purified MBP-NifL fractions was routinely calculated from their respective redox spectra (Fig. 2B). Reconstituted MBP-NifL contained between 0.9 and 1.0 mol of FAD cofactor per mol of MBP-NifL. In general, only fully reconstituted MBP-NifL protein charges (1 mol FAD/mol MBP-NifL) were used in the following reduction assays.Purification of Formate Dehydrogenase, Hydrogenase, and Menaquinones of W. succinogenes—Formate dehydrogenase and hydrogenase of W. succinogenes were isolated as described previously (37Unden G.

The reduction of MBP-NifL by formate (or hydrogen) was recorded as the absorbance difference at 452–600 nm (Δϵ452–600 nm = 6.63 mm–1 × cm–1) in B-buffer containing a constant amount of 4.2 nmol of MBP-NifL in a total test volume of 400 μl and solubilized formate dehydrogenase (or hydrogenase, respectively) or in proteoliposomal membranes (5 mg of phospholipid in a 400-μl test volume) and integrated formate dehydrogenase with amounts indicated in Table 1. The additional electron mediator dimethylnaphtoquinone (DMN) or MK in proteoliposomal membranes was also added as indicated in Table 1. The redox reaction was started by the addition of an initial concentration of 12.5 mm formate (or by the addition of molecular hydrogen). The reduction of MBP-NifL was archived by recording spectra from 600 to 360 nm in timed intervals using a spectral photometer (Spektrophotometer U-3000, Hitachi). The difference in absorbance at 452 nm, corrected for the difference in absorbance at 600 nm (turbidity and additives) of the resulting redox spectra, was used to calculate the amount of MBP-NifL reduction rate by time using the extinction coefficient of MBP-NifL bound FAD determined earlier (Δϵ452–600 nm = 6.63 mm–1 × cm–1).TABLE 1Characterization of in vitro reduction of 4.2 nmol MBP-NifL (400-μl test volume) by formate oxidation using formate dehydrogenase (Fdh) from W. succinogenesExperimentSolubilized Fdh amountDMN amountInitial FAD reduction ΔEinitialaThe reduction rates were calculated by determining the difference of the flavin-specific absorbance 2 min after formate addition.Reduced FADΔ TimeFigure depictedμgmin-1nmolmin334None0.000762.7>45.0Not shown2340.2 mm0.0152.926.0Fig. 3Fdh amount in proteoliposomesMK6 amountInitial FAD reduction ΔEinitialaThe reduction rates were calculated by determining the difference of the flavin-specific absorbance 2 min after formate addition.Reduced FADΔ TimeFigure depictedμg/mg phospholipid-1mg phospholipid-1min-1nmolmin513.60.01 μmol0.0036; 1×bThe reduction rates under the different conditions are indicated in relation to the reduction rate obtained under conditions present in Experiment 5, which was set to 1.0.2.821.0Not shown627.20.01 μmol0.014; 4×bThe reduction rates under the different conditions are indicated in relation to the reduction rate obtained under conditions present in Experiment 5, which was set to 1.0.3.118.0Fig. 5A1127.20.026 μmol0.032; 9×bThe reduction rates under the different conditions are indicated in relation to the reduction rate obtained under conditions present in Experiment 5, which was set to 1.0.3.324.3Fig. 5B1213.60.026 μmol0.0124; 4×bThe reduction rates under the different conditions are indicated in relation to the reduction rate obtained under conditions present in Experiment 5, which was set to 1.0.2.8412.0Not shown927.2None0.002; 0.14×bThe reduction rates under the different conditions are indicated in relation to the reduction rate obtained under conditions present in Experiment 5, which was set to 1.0.3.4421.0Fig. 41013.6None0.001; 0.07×bThe reduction rates under the different conditions are indicated in relation to the reduction rate obtained under conditions present in Experiment 5, which was set to 1.0.2.1677.0Not shown1327.20.017 μmol MMK60.015; 4×bThe reduction rates under the different conditions are indicated in relation to the reduction rate obtained under conditions present in Experiment 5, which was set to 1.0.1.768.0Not showna The reduction rates were calculated by determining the difference of the flavin-specific absorbance 2 min after formate addition.b The reduction rates under the different conditions are indicated in relation to the reduction rate obtained under conditions present in Experiment 5, which was set to 1.0. Open table in a new tab Analyzing Membrane Association of Reduced MBP-NifL by Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation—In a test volume of 250 μl, 6.1 nmol of MBP-NifL were fully reduced by an excess of formate (15 mm) using proteoliposomes (6.25 mg of phospholipids) containing purified formate dehydrogenase (2.5 nmol, i.e. 64 μg/mg phospholipid) and menaquinone6 (18 nmol/mg phospholipid) from W. succinogenes (34Dietrich W. Klimmek O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1086-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The complete assay was subsequently subjected under anaerobic conditions to an anaerobic sucrose gradient (10–40% sucrose in B-buffer complemented with 15 mm formate by a total volume of 28 ml). After ultracentrifugation at 175,000 × g for 270 min formate dehydrogenase activity of the different fractions was assayed as described recently (43Biel S. Simon J. Gross R. Ruiz T. Ruitenberg M. Kröger A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1974-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the various fractions were analyzed for NifL presence by Western blot analysis. For ultracentrifugation experiments in the presence of oxygen, the presence of formate dehydrogenase in the fractions was analyzed by Western blot analysis. Fractions were separated on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BioTrace®NT, Pall Life Science) (44Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989: 18.60-18.75Google Scholar). Membranes were subsequently exposed to specific polyclonal rabbit antisera directed against MBP-NifL of K. pneumoniae or formate dehydrogenase of W. succinogenes. Protein bands were detected with secondary antibodies directed against rabbit immunoglobulin G and coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad), visualized, and quantified using the ECLplus system (Amersham Biosciences) with a fluoroimager (DianaIII, Raytest).RESULTSThe goal of this work was to gain a deeper insight into the NifL reduction in K. pneumoniae resulting in membrane sequestration of the negative regulator under simultaneous nitrogen and oxygen limiting conditions. To address the question of whether electrons are directly transferred from the reduced quinone pool onto the flavoprotein NifL or via a NifLspecific protein (reductase or receptor), we studied NifL reduction using a partial reconstituted anaerobic respiratory chain from W. succinogenes.Purification of Fully Reconstituted NifL Protein and Components of the W. succinogenes Anaerobic Respiratory Chain—After MBP-NifL synthesis in K. pneumoniae under low temperatures (19 °C), reconstitution of the FAD cofactor into the flavoprotein was achieved by continuous circulation of a 10 mm FAD solution over matrix-immobilized MBP-NifL at 4 °C (see Fig. 2 and “Experimental Procedures”). The resulting purified MBP-NifL fractions, which in general contained approximately 1 mol of FAD-cofactor/mol of MBP-NifL, were used in the in vitro reduction assays described below. The respective molar extinction coefficient at 452 nm for NifL-bound FAD was determined to be Δϵ452–600 nm = 6.63 mm–1 × cm–1 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For the reconstitution of partial anaerobic respiratory chains in liposomes, native formate dehydrogenase, native hydrogenase, and both menaquinones (MK6 and MMK6) were purified from membranes of W. succinogenes as described by Dietrich and Klimmek (34Dietrich W. Klimmek O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1086-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and Biel et al. (43Biel S. Simon J. Gross R. Ruiz T. Ruitenberg M. Kröger A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1974-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Reduction of MBP-NifL by Formate Oxidation Catalyzed by Solubilized Membranous Formate Dehydrogenase of W. succinogenes—All the following analyses of MBP-NifL reduction were performed in the absence of oxygen under strictly anaerobic conditions in a test volume of 400 μl (see “Experimental Procedures”). As an initial control, formate oxidation by purified solubilized formate dehydrogenase from membranes of the anaerobic rumen bacterium W. succinogenes was studied, which demonstrated that cytochrome b of W. succinogenes formate dehydrogenase (34 μg) was fully reduced in less than 1 min after adding 12.5 mm formate (data not shown). Thus, in the following test assays 12.5 mm formate was routinely added as electron donor. To analyze whether electrons derived from formate oxidation can in principle be transferred to and reduce MBP-NifL in solution, formate was oxidized by purified solubilized W. succinogenes formate dehydrogenase (34 μg) in the presence of 4.2 nmol of purified MBP-NifL in the test assay. In the presence of 0.2 mm of the water-soluble quinone DMN, which is reduced by the cytochrome b subunit of the formate dehydrogenase by formate and which acts as an electron mediator, MBP-NifL was significantly reduced in this in vitro assay. The kinetics of the respective reduction of NifL-bound FAD cofactor was monitored by detecting the absorbance between 650 and 360 nm every 2 min as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 3, ∼3.0 nmol of MBP-NifL were reduced within 6 min after starting the reaction by the addition of 12.5 mm formate to the assay. In the absence of formate no MBP-NifL reduction was observed. In the absence of DMN but in the presence of formate MBP-NifL reduction occurred about 2 orders of magnitude slower than with the presence of the redox mediator DMN (see Table 1, Experiment 3). To calculate the amount of FAD reduction of MBP-NifL by formate oxidation, the absorbance decrease by time at 452 nm and the extinction coefficient for MBP-NifL-bound FAD (Δϵ452–600 nm = 6.63 mm–1 × cm–1) determined earlier was used. The UV-visible spectra in Fig. 3 further indicate that electrons derived from formate oxidation by formate dehydrogenase are subsequently transferred to DMN and later to the NifL-bound FAD, as no reduced cytochrome b of formate dehydrogenase is visible (Fig. 3, absorbance at 424 and 552 nm).FIGURE 3MBP-NifL reduction by formate in the presence of solubilized membranous formate dehydrogenase of W. succinogenes and DMN. Electrons derived from formate oxidation were transferred to the FAD cofactor of purified MBP-NifL (4.2 nmol) in the presence of solubilized formate dehydrogenase (Fdh) isolated from W. succinogenes and in the presence of 0.2 mm water-soluble quinone analog DMN as the electron mediator. UV-visible spectra were monitored every 2 or 3 min as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After 6 min, reduction of ∼3.0 nmol of MBP-NifL was achieved.
