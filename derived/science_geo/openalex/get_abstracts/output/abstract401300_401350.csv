https://openalex.org/W2157558738,"The biogenic amine histamine is an important pharmacological mediator involved in pathophysiological processes such as allergies and inflammations. Histamine H(1) receptor (H(1)R) antagonists are very effective drugs alleviating the symptoms of allergic reactions. Here we show the crystal structure of the H(1)R complex with doxepin, a first-generation H(1)R antagonist. Doxepin sits deep in the ligand-binding pocket and directly interacts with Trp 428(6.48), a highly conserved key residue in G-protein-coupled-receptor activation. This well-conserved pocket with mostly hydrophobic nature contributes to the low selectivity of the first-generation compounds. The pocket is associated with an anion-binding region occupied by a phosphate ion. Docking of various second-generation H(1)R antagonists reveals that the unique carboxyl group present in this class of compounds interacts with Lys 191(5.39) and/or Lys 179(ECL2), both of which form part of the anion-binding region. This region is not conserved in other aminergic receptors, demonstrating how minor differences in receptors lead to pronounced selectivity differences with small molecules. Our study sheds light on the molecular basis of H(1)R antagonist specificity against H(1)R."
https://openalex.org/W2025192477,"Background Human pluripotent stem cells have the ability to generate all cell types present in the adult organism, therefore harboring great potential for the in vitro study of differentiation and for the development of cell-based therapies. Nonetheless their use may prove challenging as incomplete differentiation of these cells might lead to tumoregenicity. Interestingly, many cancer types have been reported to display metabolic modifications with features that might be similar to stem cells. Understanding the metabolic properties of human pluripotent stem cells when compared to their differentiated counterparts can thus be of crucial importance. Furthermore recent data has stressed distinct features of different human pluripotent cells lines, namely when comparing embryo-derived human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) reprogrammed from somatic cells. Methodology/Principal Findings We compared the energy metabolism of hESCs, IPSCs, and their somatic counterparts. Focusing on mitochondria, we tracked organelle localization and morphology. Furthermore we performed gene expression analysis of several pathways related to the glucose metabolism, including glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In addition we determined oxygen consumption rates (OCR) using a metabolic extracellular flux analyzer, as well as total intracellular ATP levels by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Finally we explored the expression of key proteins involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Conclusions/Findings Our results demonstrate that, although the metabolic signature of IPSCs is not identical to that of hESCs, nonetheless they cluster with hESCs rather than with their somatic counterparts. ATP levels, lactate production and OCR revealed that human pluripotent cells rely mostly on glycolysis to meet their energy demands. Furthermore, our work points to some of the strategies which human pluripotent stem cells may use to maintain high glycolytic rates, such as high levels of hexokinase II and inactive pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)."

https://openalex.org/W2028741675,"Quantum theory demands that, in contrast to classical physics, not all properties can be simultaneously well defined. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is a manifestation of this fact. Another important corollary arises that there can be no joint probability distribution describing the outcomes of all possible measurements, allowing a quantum system to be classically understood. We provide the first experimental evidence that even for a single three-state system, a qutrit, no such classical model can exist that correctly describes the results of a simple set of pairwise compatible measurements. Not only is a single qutrit the simplest system in which such a contradiction is possible, but, even more importantly, the contradiction cannot result from entanglement, because such a system is indivisible, and it does not even allow the concept of entanglement between subsystems."
https://openalex.org/W2103934447,"Prediction of protein subcellular localization is a challenging problem, particularly when the system concerned contains both singleplex and multiplex proteins. In this paper, by introducing the ""multi-label scale"" and hybridizing the information of gene ontology with the sequential evolution information, a novel predictor called iLoc-Gneg is developed for predicting the subcellular localization of gram-positive bacterial proteins with both single-location and multiple-location sites. For facilitating comparison, the same stringent benchmark dataset used to estimate the accuracy of Gneg-mPLoc was adopted to demonstrate the power of iLoc-Gneg. The dataset contains 1,392 gram-negative bacterial proteins classified into the following eight locations: (1) cytoplasm, (2) extracellular, (3) fimbrium, (4) flagellum, (5) inner membrane, (6) nucleoid, (7) outer membrane, and (8) periplasm. Of the 1,392 proteins, 1,328 are each with only one subcellular location and the other 64 are each with two subcellular locations, but none of the proteins included has pairwise sequence identity to any other in a same subset (subcellular location). It was observed that the overall success rate by jackknife test on such a stringent benchmark dataset by iLoc-Gneg was over 91%, which is about 6% higher than that by Gneg-mPLoc. As a user-friendly web-server, iLoc-Gneg is freely accessible to the public at http://icpr.jci.edu.cn/bioinfo/iLoc-Gneg. Meanwhile, a step-by-step guide is provided on how to use the web-server to get the desired results. Furthermore, for the user's convenience, the iLoc-Gneg web-server also has the function to accept the batch job submission, which is not available in the existing version of Gneg-mPLoc web-server. It is anticipated that iLoc-Gneg may become a useful high throughput tool for Molecular Cell Biology, Proteomics, System Biology, and Drug Development."

https://openalex.org/W2162019687,"CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), a ligand of CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), is essential to mount an adequate inflammatory response to repair acute skeletal muscle injury. We studied the mechanisms by which CCL2 regulates muscle inflammation and regeneration. Mobilization of monocytes/macrophages (MOs/MPs) but not lymphocytes or neutrophils was impaired from bone marrow to blood and from blood to injured muscles in Ccl2(-/-) mice. This was accompanied by poor phagocytosis, reduced up-regulation of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and impaired muscle regeneration. Bone marrow transfer from wild-type mice to irradiated Ccr2(-/-) but not Ccl2(-/-) mice restored muscle inflammation. Intravenously injected CCL2-deficient bone marrow monocytes could not enter wild-type injured muscles as well as wild-type bone marrow monocytes. Intravenously injected wild-type bone marrow monocytes could not enter CCL2-deficient injured muscles as well as wild-type injured muscles. CCL2 stimulated IGF-1 expression by wild-type but not CCR2-deficient intramuscular macrophages. A single intramuscular injection of IGF-1, but not PBS, markedly improved muscle regeneration in Ccl2(-/-) mice. We conclude that CCL2 is a major ligand of CCR2 to recruit MOs/MPs into injured muscles to conduct phagocytosis and produce IGF-1 for injury repair. CCL2 needs to be expressed by bone marrow cells, circulating monocytes, and injured muscle tissue cells to recruit MOs/MPs into injured muscles. CCL2/CCR2 signaling also up-regulates IGF-1 expression by intramuscular macrophages to promote acute skeletal muscle injury repair."
https://openalex.org/W2037074869,"Although much attention has been devoted to resveratrol, a unique polyphenol produced by plants and credited as potentially being responsible for the 'French paradox'--the observation that French people have a relatively low incidence of coronary heart disease, even though their diet is high in saturated fats--the oligomers of resveratrol have been largely ignored despite their high biological activity. Challenges in achieving their isolation in sufficient quantity from natural sources, coupled with an inability to prepare them easily synthetically, are seen as the main obstacles. Here we report a programmable, controlled and potentially scalable synthesis of the resveratrol family via a three-stage design. The synthetic approach requires strategy- and reagent-guided chemical functionalizations to differentiate two distinct cores possessing multiple sites with the same or similar reactivity, ultimately leading to five higher-order natural products. This work demonstrates that challenging, positionally selective functionalizations of complex materials are possible where biosynthetic studies have indicated otherwise, it provides materials and tools with which to unlock the full biochemical potential of this family of natural products, and it affords an intellectual framework within which other oligomeric families could potentially be accessed."

https://openalex.org/W2106812423,"Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases catalyze the oxidation of carbonylic substrates to ester or lactone products using NADPH as electron donor and molecular oxygen as oxidative reactant. Using protein engineering, kinetics, microspectrophotometry, crystallography, and intermediate analogs, we have captured several snapshots along the catalytic cycle which highlight key features in enzyme catalysis. After acting as electron donor, the enzyme-bound NADP(H) forms an H-bond with the flavin cofactor. This interaction is critical for stabilizing the oxygen-activating flavin-peroxide intermediate that results from the reaction of the reduced cofactor with oxygen. An essential active-site arginine acts as anchoring element for proper binding of the ketone substrate. Its positively charged guanidinium group can enhance the propensity of the substrate to undergo a nucleophilic attack by the flavin-peroxide intermediate. Furthermore, the arginine side chain, together with the NADP+ ribose group, forms the niche that hosts the negatively charged Criegee intermediate that is generated upon reaction of the substrate with the flavin-peroxide. The fascinating ability of Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases to catalyze a complex multistep catalytic reaction originates from concerted action of this Arg-NADP(H) pair and the flavin subsequently to promote flavin reduction, oxygen activation, tetrahedral intermediate formation, and product synthesis and release. The emerging picture is that these enzymes are mainly oxygen-activating and “Criegee-stabilizing” catalysts that act on any chemically suitable substrate that can diffuse into the active site, emphasizing their potential value as toolboxes for biocatalytic applications.

IntroductionFlavoprotein monooxygenases catalyze the insertion of an oxygen atom into an organic substrate in hydroxylations, epoxidations, Baeyer-Villiger oxidations, and N- and S-oxidations (1Massey V.

These enzymes activate molecular oxygen to overcome its spin-forbidden reaction with an organic molecule through formation of a stable C4a-(hydro)peroxy-flavin adduct (the “flavin-peroxide,” Scheme 1) (4van Berkel W.J.

In the case of Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs), 3The abbreviations used are: BVMOBaeyer-Villiger monooxygenasePAMOphenylacetone monooxygenase. the flavin-peroxide nucleophilically attacks the carbonyl group of ketone substrates with the formation of a covalent tetrahedral Criegee intermediate, analogous to the intermediate that forms in nonenzymatic Baeyer-Villiger oxidations (5Criegee R. Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1948; 560: 127-135Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar). An electronic rearrangement yields an ester or lactone, a water molecule, and the oxidized flavin. A key feature of BVMOs and related monooxygenases is the dual role of NADP(H) in catalysis; it acts as the electron donor to reduce the flavin, and it is required for the stabilization of the essential flavin-peroxide intermediate (6Alfieri A.

Chem. 2010; 285: 35021-35028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which all share the property of utilizing NADP+ to stabilize the crucial flavin-(hydro)peroxide. The data on cyclohexanone monooxygenase suggested a “sliding” process during catalysis. NADPH first binds in the position competent for hydride donation to the flavin N5 atom. Next, NADP+ slides over the flavin to adopt the conformation observed in the NADP+-bound crystal structures. The elucidated PAMO-NADP+ structure fully conforms to this proposal (Scheme 1).A fundamental question for the functioning of BVMOs and, more generally, for flavin and oxygen enzymology, is to understand the nature of the essential role played by NADP+ in flavin-peroxide stabilization (Scheme 1). This flavin intermediate is characterized by an absorption peak in the 360–390-nm region, often with an extinction coefficient similar to that of the ∼370-nm peak of the fully oxidized flavin (3Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 276-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 9Sheng D. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11156-11167Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, spectra measured during reoxidation (see spectrum C) are nearly identical to the spectrum of the oxidized enzyme from 360 nm to 390 nm, whereas their absorbance in the 450-nm region is well below that of the oxidized flavin. These findings suggest that a fraction (∼20%) of the crystalline enzyme molecules might be in the flavin-peroxide form during reoxidation. However, crystal spectra never indicated substantial (>50% occupancy) accumulation of the intermediate in the crystals. Apparently, the crystalline environment and highly viscous crystallization solutions prevent intermediate accumulation, possibly because the rate of its formation in the crystals is slower than that of its decay. Furthermore, the putative low occupancy flavin-peroxide intermediate seen in the spectrum is immediately reduced by x-rays. Nevertheless, the structure of reduced PAMO with NADP+ provides considerable insight into flavin-peroxide formation. A key observation is that the carboxamide group of NADP+ establishes an H-bond with the N5 atom of the reduced flavin (Fig. 2B). Such an H-bond protects the reduced flavin from losing its N5 proton to the surrounding medium, and its has been recently highlighted by studies on various enzymes that stabilize the flavin-(hydro)peroxide, including flavin-containing monooxygenases (7Orru R. Torres Pazmiño D.E. Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 35021-35028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), p-hydroxyphenylacetate hydroxylase, and pyranose oxidase (37Ruangchan N. Tongsook C. Sucharitakul J.

Chem. 2011; 286: 16900-16909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Transient proton exchange (with solvent or neighboring groups) is thought to favor the decay of the intermediate, whose stability requires a stably protonated N5 atom (8Jones K.C. Ballou D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2553-2559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, an “unprotected” N5 could donate the proton directly to the distal oxygen of the flavin-peroxide adduct, inevitably leading to intermediate collapse. Thus, the emerging fundamental concept is that NADP+ is required for oxygen-activation primarily by providing essential H-bonding interactions that modulate flavin reactivity.Another insightful observation from the structure of the reduced enzyme-NADP+ complex concerns Arg-337, which adopts an extended conformation to interact with the negatively charged reduced flavin (Fig. 2B). This conformation obstructs the site for the organic substrate, whose catalytically competent binding is prevented prior to the reaction with dioxygen to maintain the C4a-N5 locus of the reduced flavin readily accessible for dioxygen. Upon formation of the flavin-peroxide and the concomitant loss of the negative charge on the flavin ring, Arg-337 shifts back to the conformation interacting with the NADP+ nicotinamide, making the catalytic center accessible to the substrate (Figs. 2, A and B, and 4, A and C, and Scheme 1). This observation is consistent with multisubstrate kinetic studies. The order of NADPH and substrate binding was studied for the R217A mutant of PAMO, which features a Km for NADPH (320 μm) suited for this type of experiments (the mutation is unlikely to affect the reaction mechanism because Arg-217 is located far away from the flavin) (39Dudek H.M. Torres Pazmiño D.E. Rodríguez C. de Gonzalo G. Gotor V. Fraaije M.W. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2010; 88: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). When the observed reaction rates were plotted according to Lineweaver-Burk method, the characteristic pattern of parallel lines was observed, indicating an ordered binding of substrates. In particular, the parallel lines are consistent with a sequential mechanism with an intervening irreversible step (i.e. flavin reoxidation). The binding location of MES in the D66A structure further suggests that the extended conformation of Arg-337 might represent a steering element for the substrate, guiding it into the active site upon flavin-peroxide formation (Scheme 1).The structure of the enzyme in complex with MES indicates that Arg-337 and the NADP+ ribose cooperate in forming a binding site for a negative charge. We modeled the Criegee intermediate using the complex with MES as reference structure (Fig. 4D). The model was built by positioning the intermediate tetrahedral group on the site occupied by the sulfonic moiety of MES and by positioning the phenylacetone ring in a location overlapping that of MES morpholino group. Such a modeling experiment reveals that the Criegee intermediate can be perfectly accommodated in the active site with Arg-337 and NADP+-ribose acting as the H-bond donors for the negatively charge oxygen of the tetrahedral group. At the same time, the sulfur atom of the MES sulfonic group mimics the carbonyl carbon of the substrate that is covalently attacked by the terminal oxygen of the flavin-peroxide (Fig. 4D). In this scenario, Arg-337 has a dual role in substrate oxygenation: (i) it H-bonds to the carbonyl oxygen of the substrate enhancing the propensity of the carbonyl carbon to undergo the nucleophilic attack by the flavin-peroxide, and (ii) together with the NADP+ ribose, it compensates for the negative charge of the Criegee intermediate.It is worth noting that the active-site architecture does not identify clear elements for recognition of specific substrate(s). Rather, the active site appears to be primarily designed to activate dioxygen through flavin-peroxide stabilization and to stabilize the Criegee intermediate. In other words, PAMO and similar BVMOs are mainly oxygen-activating and “Criegee-stabilizing” catalysts that act on any chemically suitable substrate that can diffuse into the active site and reach the catalytic center where the flavin-peroxide and oxyanion hole are positioned. Along these lines, it is not surprising that substrate specificity of PAMO and similar enzymes can be manipulated by simple mutations such as those targeting Met-446. These data emphasize the potential of using PAMO and similar BVMOs as toolboxes for biocatalytic applications and support the idea that protein engineering and directed evolution methods can be used effectively to develop finely tuned biocatalysts.

These enzymes activate molecular oxygen to overcome its spin-forbidden reaction with an organic molecule through formation of a stable C4a-(hydro)peroxy-flavin adduct (the “flavin-peroxide,” Scheme 1) (4van Berkel W.J.

In the case of Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs), 3The abbreviations used are: BVMOBaeyer-Villiger monooxygenasePAMOphenylacetone monooxygenase. the flavin-peroxide nucleophilically attacks the carbonyl group of ketone substrates with the formation of a covalent tetrahedral Criegee intermediate, analogous to the intermediate that forms in nonenzymatic Baeyer-Villiger oxidations (5Criegee R. Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1948; 560: 127-135Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar). An electronic rearrangement yields an ester or lactone, a water molecule, and the oxidized flavin. A key feature of BVMOs and related monooxygenases is the dual role of NADP(H) in catalysis; it acts as the electron donor to reduce the flavin, and it is required for the stabilization of the essential flavin-peroxide intermediate (6Alfieri A.

https://openalex.org/W2044016855,"Flying birds often form flocks, with social, navigational and anti-predator implications. Further, flying in a flock can result in aerodynamic benefits, thus reducing power requirements, as demonstrated by a reduction in heart rate and wingbeat frequency in pelicans flying in a V-formation. But how general is an aerodynamic power reduction due to group-flight? V-formation flocks are limited to moderately steady flight in relatively large birds, and may represent a special case. What are the aerodynamic consequences of flying in the more usual 'cluster' flock? Here we use data from innovative back-mounted Global Positioning System (GPS) and 6-degrees-of-freedom inertial sensors to show that pigeons (1) maintain powered, banked turns like aircraft, imposing dorsal accelerations of up to 2g, effectively doubling body weight and quadrupling induced power requirements; (2) increase flap frequency with increases in all conventional aerodynamic power requirements; and (3) increase flap frequency when flying near, particularly behind, other birds. Therefore, unlike V-formation pelicans, pigeons do not gain an aerodynamic advantage from flying in a flock. Indeed, the increased flap frequency, whether due to direct aerodynamic interactions or requirements for increased stability or control, suggests a considerable energetic cost to flight in a tight cluster flock."

Compared to wild-type (WT), αMHC-CYP2J2 Tr hearts showed increased recovery of left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and decreased infarct size after I/R. In contrast, LVDP recovery and infarct size were unchanged in Tie2-CYP2J2 Tr and Tie2-sEH Tr hearts. Surprisingly, compared to WT, Tie2-CYP2C8 Tr hearts had significantly reduced LVDP recovery (from 21 to 14%) and increased infarct size after I/R (from 51 to 61%). Tie2-CYP2C8 Tr hearts also exhibited increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, dihydroxyoctadecenoic acid (DiHOME) formation, and coronary resistance after I/R. ROS scavengers and CYP2C8 inhibition reversed the detrimental effects of CYP2C8 expression in Tie2-CYP2C8 Tr hearts. Treatment of WT hearts with 250 nM 9,10-DiHOME decreased LVDP recovery compared to vehicle (16 vs. 31%, respectively) and increased coronary resistance after I/R. These data demonstrate that increased ROS generation and enhanced DiHOME synthesis by endothelial CYP2C8 impair functional recovery and mask the beneficial effects of increased EET production following I/R."

It is also well known that social isolation in male mice results in aggressive behavior. However, it is not known how social isolation-induced aggression affects anxiety and depressive-like behavior in isolated male mice subjected to unpredictable chronic mild stress (CMS), an animal model of depression. Methodology/Principal Findings C57/B6 male mice were divided into 3 groups; non-stressed controls, in Group I; isolated mice subjected to the CMS protocol in Group II and aggression by physical contact in socially isolated mice subjected to the CMS protocol in Group III. In the sucrose intake test, ingestion of a 1% sucrose solution by mice in Groups II and III was significantly lower than in Group I. Furthermore, intake of this solution in Group III mice was significantly lower than in Group II mice. In the open field test, mice in Group III, showed reduced locomotor activity and reduced entry and retention time in the central zone, compared to Groups I and II mice. Moreover, the distances moved in 1 hour by Group III mice did not differ between night and morning. In the light/black box test, Groups II and III animals spent significantly less time in the light box compared to Group I animals. In the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST), the immobility times of Group II and Group III mice were significantly longer than in Group I mice. In addition, immobility times in the FST were significantly longer in Group III than in Group II mice. Conclusions/Significance These findings show that social isolation-induced aggression could potentiate anxiety and depressive -like behaviors in isolated male mice subjected to CMS."

Insights into how the CblC scaffold supports this chemical dichotomy have been unavailable despite it being the most common locus of patient mutations associated with inherited cobalamin disorders that manifest in both severe homocystinuria and methylmalonic aciduria. Herein, we report structures of human CblC, with and without bound MeCbl, which provide novel biochemical insights into its mechanism of action. Our results reveal that CblC is the most divergent member of the NADPH-dependent flavin reductase family and can use FMN or FAD as a prosthetic group to catalyze reductive decyanation. Furthermore, CblC is the first example of an enzyme with glutathione transferase activity that has a sequence and structure unrelated to the GST superfamily. CblC thus represents an example of evolutionary adaptation of a common structural platform to perform diverse chemistries. The CblC structure allows us to rationalize the biochemical basis of a number of pathological mutations associated with severe clinical phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2056107546,"Due to limited interaction of migratory birds between Eurasia and America, two independent avian influenza virus (AIV) gene pools have evolved. There is evidence of low frequency reassortment between these regions, which has major implications in global AIV dynamics. Indeed, all currently circulating lineages of the PB1 and PA segments in North America are of Eurasian origin. Large-scale analyses of intercontinental reassortment have shown that viruses isolated from Charadriiformes (gulls, terns, and shorebirds) are the major contributor of these outsider events. To clarify the role of gulls in AIV dynamics, specifically in movement of genes between geographic regions, we have sequenced six gull AIV isolated in Alaska and analyzed these along with 142 other available gull virus sequences. Basic investigations of host species and the locations and times of isolation reveal biases in the available sequence information. Despite these biases, our analyses reveal a high frequency of geographic reassortment in gull viruses isolated in America. This intercontinental gene mixing is not found in the viruses isolated from gulls in Eurasia. This study demonstrates that gulls are important as vectors for geographically reassorted viruses, particularly in America, and that more surveillance effort should be placed on this group of birds."

Here, we have characterized the molecular mechanisms leading to the dedifferentiation of primary cultured articular chondrocytes by IL-1β treatment. IL-1β or lipopolysaccharide, but not phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, retinoic acid, or epidermal growth factor, induced nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) expression, showing the association of inflammatory cytokines with NAMPT regulation. SIRT1, in turn, was activated NAMPT-dependently, without any alteration in the expression level. Activation or inhibition of SIRT1 oppositevely regulates IL-1β-mediated chondrocyte dedifferentiation, suggesting this protein as a key regulator of chondrocytes phenotype. SIRT1 activation promotes induction of ERK and p38 kinase activities, but not JNK, in response to IL-1β. Subsequently, ERK and p38 kinase activated by SIRT1 also induce SIRT1 activation, forming a positive feedback loop to sustain downstream signaling of these kinases. Moreover, we found that the SIRT1-ERK complex, but not SIRT1-p38, is engaged in IL-1β-induced chondrocyte dedifferentiation via a Sox-9-mediated mechanism. JNK is activated by IL-1β and modulates dedifferentiation of chondrocytes, but this pathway is independent on NAMPT-SIRT1 signaling. Based on these findings, we propose that IL-1β induces dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes by up-regulation of SIRT1 activity enhanced by both NAMPT and ERK signaling."

Csn2 is a Nmeni subtype-specific cas gene required for new spacer acquisition. Here we characterize the Enterococcus faecalis Csn2 protein as a double-stranded (ds-) DNA-binding protein and report its 2.7 Å tetrameric ring structure. The inner circle of the Csn2 tetrameric ring is ∼26 Å wide and populated with conserved lysine residues poised for nonspecific interactions with ds-DNA. Each Csn2 protomer contains an α/β domain and an α-helical domain; significant hinge motion was observed between these two domains. Ca(2+) was located at strategic positions in the oligomerization interface. We further showed that removal of Ca(2+) ions altered the oligomerization state of Csn2, which in turn severely decreased its affinity for ds-DNA. In summary, our results provided the first insight into the function of the Csn2 protein in CRISPR adaptation by revealing that it is a ds-DNA-binding protein functioning at the quaternary structure level and regulated by Ca(2+) ions."

However, binding details and how specificity is achieved in such receptors remain important unresolved issues. We solved the crystal structures of the N-terminal β1,3-glucan recognition domain of βGRP/GNBP3 (βGRP-N) in complex with the β1,3-linked glucose hexamer, laminarihexaose. In the crystals, three structured laminarihexaoses simultaneously interact through six glucose residues (two from each chain) with one βGRP-N. The spatial arrangement of the laminarihexaoses bound to βGRP-N is almost identical to that of a β1,3-glucan triple-helical structure. Therefore, our crystallographic structures together with site-directed mutagenesis data provide a structural basis for the unique recognition by such receptors of the triple-helical structure of β1,3-glucan."
https://openalex.org/W1968292718,"Background Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is characterised by increased production of parathyroid hormone (PTH) resulting in elevated serum calcium levels. The influence on bone metabolism with altered bone resorption is the most studied clinical condition in PHPT. In addition to this, patients with PHPT are at increased risk of non-skeletal diseases, such as impaired insulin sensitivity, arterial hypertension and increased risk of death by cardiovascular diseases (CVD), possibly mediated by a chronic low-grade inflammation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether adipose tissue reflects the low-grade inflammation observed in PHPT patients. Methodology/Principal Findings Subcutaneous fat tissue from the neck was sampled from 16 non-obese patients with PHPT and from 16 patients operated for benign thyroid diseases, serving as weight-matched controls. RNA was extracted and global gene expression was analysed with Illumina BeadArray Technology. We found 608 differentially expressed genes (q-value<0.05), of which 347 were up-regulated and 261 were down-regulated. Gene ontology analysis showed that PHPT patients expressed increased levels of genes involved in immunity and defense (e.g. matrix metallopeptidase 9, S100 calcium binding protein A8 and A9, CD14, folate receptor 2), and reduced levels of genes involved in metabolic processes. Analysis of transcription factor binding sites present in the differentially expressed genes corroborated the up-regulation of inflammatory processes. Conclusions/Significance Our findings demonstrate that PHPT strongly influences gene regulation in fat tissue, which may result in altered adipose tissue function and release of pathogenic factors that increase the risk of CVD."

IntroductionPlasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) 4The abbreviations used are: PAI-1plasminogen activator inhibitor-1DSCdifferential scanning calorimetryRCLreactive center looptPAtissue type plasminogen activatorMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidPDBProtein Data Bank. is a specific and fast-acting inhibitor of each of the two plasminogen activators, tissue type (tPA) and urokinase type plasminogen activator and thus an inhibitor of plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis and tissue remodeling. Since its discovery in the mid-1980s, this member of the serpin family has been intensely studied to achieve an in-depth understanding of its physiological and pathophysiological functions (for a review see Ref. 1Dupont D.M. Madsen J.B. Kristensen T. Bodker J.S. Blouse G.E. Wind T. Andreasen P.A. Front. Biosci. 2009; 14: 1337-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). PAI-1 has been directly implicated in cardiovascular diseases and cancer and is a potential therapeutic target (for reviews see Refs. 2Gils A. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 91: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar and 3Andreasen P.A. Curr. Drug. Targets. 2007; 8: 1030-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition to the target proteases, PAI-1 also binds to endocytosis receptors of the low density lipoprotein receptor family and the extracellular matrix glycoprotein vitronectin (for a review, see Ref. 1Dupont D.M. Madsen J.B. Kristensen T. Bodker J.S. Blouse G.E. Wind T. Andreasen P.A. Front. Biosci. 2009; 14: 1337-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To better understand these molecular interactions, many loss-of-function or loss-of-interaction mutants have been constructed (4De Taeye B. Gils A. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 92: 898-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Central to the protease inhibition mechanism is the 20-residue surface-exposed loop called the reactive center loop (RCL) that initially interacts with the target serine protease in the same way as a substrate. Following the initial protease cleavage, the N-terminal part of the RCL inserts as strand 4 in β-sheet A (s4A), the central sheet in PAI-1, translocating the covalently linked protease to the opposite pole of the serpin and thereby trapping it in an inactive covalent complex. The insertion of the RCL into β-sheet A is believed to release energy needed to drive the inhibitory mechanism, converting the serpin into the thermodynamically most stable form (5Ye S. Cech A.L. Belmares R. Bergstrom R.C. Tong Y. Corey D.R. Kanost M.R. Goldsmith E.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 979-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Under certain conditions, PAI-1 exhibits “substrate behavior,” during which the active protease is prematurely released prior to RCL insertion, leaving the serpin in an inactive protease-cleaved form (for reviews, see Refs. 1Dupont D.M. Madsen J.B. Kristensen T. Bodker J.S. Blouse G.E. Wind T. Andreasen P.A. Front. Biosci. 2009; 14: 1337-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar and 4De Taeye B. Gils A. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 92: 898-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).PAI-1 shares a unique functional feature among less than a handful of serpins in its ability to spontaneously insert the RCL into β-sheet A without prior cleavage with a half-life of 1–2 h at 37 °C, resulting in a thermodynamically more stable and noninhibitory state, termed the latent form (7Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The physiological function of latency transition is still uncertain but may serve as a protection against long term anti-fibrinolytic actions of PAI-1. Latency transition adds an experimental challenge for time extensive in vitro and in vivo assays on PAI-1 or when growing protein crystals.In 1995, a quadruply mutated (N150H, K154T, Q319L, and M354I) PAI-1 termed 14-1B was isolated by random mutagenesis screens. The conversion of 14-1B to the latent state at 37 °C was delayed by more than 70-fold. In addition, 14-1B exhibits a large increase in thermodynamic stability, manifested by a 10 °C increase in the denaturation temperature (8Berkenpas M.B. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first x-ray crystal structure of active PAI-1 was determined with 14-1B at a resolution of 3 Å (9Sharp A.M. Stein P.E. Pannu N.S. Carrell R.W. Berkenpas M.B. Ginsburg D. Lawrence D.A. Read R.J. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 111-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The structure featured the same overall fold as other inhibitory serpins (for a review, see Ref. 10Gettins P.G. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). Higher resolution structures of active 14-1B have since been determined (see supplemental Table S1), with resolutions of 2.7 (11Nar H. Bauer M. Stassen J.M. Lang D. Gils A. Declerck P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 683-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and 2.4 Å (12Stout T.J. Graham H. Buckley D.I. Matthews D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8460-8469Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), respectively. Because 14-1B retained inhibitory activity toward the target proteases, the x-ray crystal structure analysis of 14-1B has provided the basis for many biochemical investigations of active PAI-1, including the mapping of sites for molecular interactions and interpreting functional effects caused by single or multiple mutations in PAI-1 (4De Taeye B. Gils A. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 92: 898-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, accumulating evidence has raised questions about the validity of using 14-1B as a valid representative of the wild type protein (13Hägglöf P. Bergström F. Wilczynska M. Johansson L.B. Ny T.

As examples, 14-1B was observed to differ from native PAI-1 when analyzing the binding of a set of conformational specific antibodies (14Li S.H. Gorlatova N.V. Lawrence D.A. Schwartz B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18147-18157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and when studying the ability of PAI-1 to induce multimerization of its cofactor vitronectin (16Schar C.R.

Chem. 2008; 283: 10297-10309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).In a study designed to dissect the contributions to the intrinsic fluorescence from each of the four Trp residues in human PAI-1, Trp175, which is highly conserved among serpins, was substituted with a Phe. In addition to a small increase in substrate behavior when reacting with tPA and an only 3.5-fold delayed latency transition (t½ = ∼7 h, 37 °C), W175F behaved similarly to wild type PAI-1 with regard to all tested biochemical functions (17Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Kvassman J.O. Yunus S. Thompson J.H. Betts R.L. Lutter L.C. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12260-12272Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The mutated residue is centered in the “breach” region, where β-sheet A opens to allow the insertion of the first residue of the RCL. Residue 175 was shown to be important for the regulation of the rate of insertion of the first few residues of the RCL (17Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Kvassman J.O. Yunus S. Thompson J.H. Betts R.L. Lutter L.C. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12260-12272Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Here we report the crystal structure of PAI-1 W175F at 2.3 Å resolution. We were able to identify a previously unknown chloride site that leads to a revised hypothesis of how elevated salt concentrations stabilize the inhibitory activity of PAI-1. Furthermore, two novel binding sites for Zn2+ were identified that likely contribute to the reported affinity of PAI-1 for divalent metal ions. We demonstrate that W175F PAI-1 has a thermodynamic stability comparable with that of active wild type PAI-1. In accordance with this, the structural analysis provides evidence that a single substitution does not impose significant structural deviations from the wild type conformation. Comparison with the current structural model of active PAI-1 reveals significant structural differences with biochemical implications. We believe that our new structure represents a correct model for the metastable active form of PAI-1, thus providing some missing key information that enhances the structural characterization of the active form. Our observations also provide evidence that the thermodynamic stability of serpins is not the only determinant of the rate of RCL insertion.DISCUSSIONAs a member of the serpin superfamily, PAI-1 shares common structural features with others in the family. Specifically, the serpins are comprised of a core fold containing three β-sheets and several α-helices, with the RCL protruding from the core and accessible to target proteases. A unique feature of serpins is that their native forms are “metastable” because the exposed RCL is not in its most stable conformation. The mobility of the RCL is the feature that guides the inhibitory activity of serpins, and the RCL inserts readily into the central β-sheet upon cleavage by proteases and formation of a covalent acyl-intermediate. The driving force for this conformational change is thermodynamic, yielding a more stable and more extensive central β-sheet.W175F PAI-1 Offers a Model of Native PAI-1With PAI-1, this insertion of the RCL into the central β-sheet occurs readily, even without an interaction with target proteases, yielding a latent conformation that is inactive. Although serpins are all characterized by the metastable nature of the active conformation, the latency conversion for most is quite slow. In contrast, the conversion to the latent conformation occurs readily with PAI-1, with a half-life of only ∼1 h at 37 °C. This facile relaxation of PAI-1 to the latent form has hampered structural determination of the metastable active protein. The main force driving the structural rearrangement of PAI-1 during protease inhibition and latency transition is the large thermodynamic energy difference between the active conformation and the more stable RCL-inserted forms. Here we confirm published data showing that the functional stabilization of 14-1B PAI-1 is also accompanied by a large increase in thermodynamic stability (Fig. 1), whereas W175F PAI-1 has thermodynamic stability comparable with that of wild type PAI-1. The determination of the x-ray crystallographic structure of W175F PAI-1 thus provides a more relevant structure for the metastable active form.Structural Changes Are Apparent near the Vitronectin-binding Site in the Flexible Joint RegionSeveral structural features of W175F differ from the well characterized 14-1B form, which is dramatically stabilized so that it has lost most of its metastable character. A binding partner for PAI-1 that exists in high concentrations in plasma and tissues is vitronectin. Association of PAI-1 with vitronectin stabilizes the active conformation and significantly slows the latency transition. The complex of the N-terminal somatomedin B domain from vitronectin and PAI-1 has been determined (25Zhou A. Huntington J.A. Pannu N.S. Carrell R.W. Read R.J. Nat. Struct Biol. 2003; 10: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), revealing a binding site in PAI-1 that is known as the flexible joint region in the vicinity of β-strands 1A, 2A, and 3A and the nearby helices D and E. The previously determined structure for the constitutively active 14-1B form of PAI-1, which has been the prior reference structure for the “active” form of PAI-1, contains four mutations, three of which are in the vicinity of this flexible joint region. Strikingly, the most notable structural differences comparing the W175F and 14-1B structures are proximal to this region. Notably, the loop connecting hF with strand 3A spanning the flexible joint region is missing a 310-helix that is observed in the 14-1B structure. Such a difference near the binding region for the key regulatory protein vitronectin makes the W175F PAI-1 structure preferred for ongoing studies on vitronectin-PAI-1 interactions.The Helix F Loop Region Is Likely to Move as an Independent DomainThe conformation of the hF loop region in W175F closely mimics the conformation observed in the latent (9Sharp A.M. Stein P.E. Pannu N.S. Carrell R.W. Berkenpas M.B. Ginsburg D. Lawrence D.A. Read R.J. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 111-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (161) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5C) and the cleaved (26Jensen J.K. Gettins P.G. Protein Sci. 2008; 17: 1844-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (not shown) structures of PAI-1. The fact that the fold in the hF loop region is invariant between the active W175F and the latent structure indicates that this region behaves as an independent unit that remains unaffected by the major structural rearrangements in the remainder of the PAI-1 molecule during the insertion of the additional β-strand into sheet A (Fig. 5C). This observation supports the idea that the hF loop region moves as a rigid unit to allow space for the insertion of the RCL (27Gettins P.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 2-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Other Structural Differences Distinguish the Metastable and Constitutively Active StructuresIn the work described by Blouse et al. (17Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Kvassman J.O. Yunus S. Thompson J.H. Betts R.L. Lutter L.C. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12260-12272Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), in which W175F PAI-1 was generated, the exchange to phenylalanine was hypothesized to slow early preinsertion of the RCL prior to latency transition. In support of the importance of the area around position 175 is the model that includes an intermediate form of active wild type PAI-1 with a partially inserted RCL, a form termed the “prelatent” form (13Hägglöf P. Bergström F. Wilczynska M. Johansson L.B. Ny T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14Li S.H. Gorlatova N.V. Lawrence D.A. Schwartz B.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 16329-16335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although no direct structural evidence exists for this prelatent form of PAI-1, it is thought to resemble what is observed for native antithrombin (30Johnson D.J. Langdown J. Li W. Luis S.A. Baglin T.P. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35478-35486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) in which the first few N-terminal residues of the RCL are inserted into a partially open β-sheet A, with the conformation of the breach region resembling what was observed for the structures of both the latent (PDB code 1LJ5) and cleaved (PDB code 3CVM) PAI-1.Our new structure for W175F PAI-1 reveals shorter lengths observed for s3A and s2A that could facilitate the early stages of preinsertion. Although this is not direct proof, the structure would favor the ease of preinsertion and would thereby speed up RCL insertion, consistent with the relative fast decay of inhibitory activity of both wild type and W175F PAI-1 as compared with the slow transition of 14-1B. Furthermore, evidence from other serpins indicates the area spanning the top of s2A, s3A, and the connection to hD to be an important regulatory element by which cofactor binding to hD and hE influences the conformation of the RCL and thereby the reactivity of the serpins toward target proteases (30Johnson D.J.

Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6670-6679Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our structural analysis also provides an explanation for why a conformationally sensitive antibody that recognizes the W86 loop preferentially binds to wild type active PAI-1 over active 14-1B (14Li S.H. Gorlatova N.V. Lawrence D.A. Schwartz B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18147-18157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This W86 loop is significantly different between our structure and the structure of 14-1B (data not shown). Specifically, the bulky side chain of W86 protrudes into the solvent in our structure, whereas it points inwards and is buried inside the structure of 14-1B. From these comparisons, we conclude that the four point mutations in 14-1B result in widespread conformational differences (Fig. 1) that apparently lead to a general higher conformational rigidity of 14-1B.The region around the single substituted residue Phe175 reveals no significant changes in the backbone conformation when compared with 14-1B (PDB code 1DVN) and a relatively modest shift when compared with the latent conformation (PDB code 1DVM) of PAI-1. Nonetheless, the side chain at position 175 occupies the same site, which presumably exhibits complementarity and high affinity for aromatic side chains (Fig. 4, C and D). The mechanism that results in the mere 3.6-fold slower latency transition in the W175F mutant thus appears to result from local effects caused by the substitution of the Trp side chain by Phe, which increases the activation energy for RCL insertion rather than inducing global structural changes and stabilization as observed for 14-1B. Taken together, the differences between the W175F and 14-1B PAI-1 structures harbored in key regions for vitronectin binding and affecting the length of S2A and S3A, with minimal changes at the site of the mutation, indicate that the W175F structure represents a new unbiased model for the native active fold of the PAI-1 molecule.The Chloride-binding Site in the Gate Region Accounts for the Stabilizing Effect of SaltThe hypothesis that the salt-dependent stabilization of PAI-1 activity is caused by a specifically bound chloride atom was originally proposed by Stout et al. (12Stout T.J. Graham H. Buckley D.I. Matthews D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8460-8469Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although our new data support this hypothesis, the originally proposed location of the binding site in the 14-1B structure close to the hF loop region (Fig. 2) is not observed in our structure. It appears that the original binding site was indeed an artifact resulting from the induced conformational changes in the hF loop region caused by three of the four mutations in 14-1B. The effects of halide salts on stability were studied in the work published by Stout et al. (12Stout T.J. Graham H. Buckley D.I. Matthews D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8460-8469Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and a preferential stabilization was observed, with fluorine exhibiting the greatest effect followed by chlorine, bromine, and iodine, respectively. These studies were performed at a single time point following incubation of PAI-1 at either 37 °C or room temperature in a 150 mm halide concentration. Our studies comparing chlorine, bromine, and fluorine effects on stability, extended to include both wild type and W175F PAI-1, measured half-lives by taking measurements over an extended time frame rather than titrating tPA with PAI-1 at a single incubation time point. Nonetheless, our studies do not show any significant differences at the 150 mm concentration. Instead, pronounced differences in half-lives are observed at a 1.0 m sodium halide concentration, with chloride clearly giving the highest degree of stabilization of PAI-1. The reason for the differing results is not clear. We note that the halide salts had effects on the amidolytic activity of tPA and that controls for these effects were required for an accurate half-life determination for PAI-1.Even though the crystals were grown at salt concentrations above those observed in vivo, it is likely that chloride-binding site will be observed under in vivo conditions. As seen in Fig. 4B, the chloride-binding pocket is disrupted in the latent form of PAI-1 because of rearrangements caused by the movement of secondary structural elements when β-sheet A expands upon RCL insertion. The former strand s1C, extracted from β-sheet C during latency transition, now stretches through the gate region as an extended loop precluding Cl− binding. In summary, the new data provide a plausible and simple explanation for the stabilizing effect of salt as reviewed by De Taeye et al. (4De Taeye B. Gils A. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 92: 898-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Our data support the proposed mechanism of chloride stabilization (12Stout T.J. Graham H. Buckley D.I. Matthews D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8460-8469Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) but add a crucial correction of the actual location of the chloride-binding site to a location more directly linked to the observed retardation of latency transition. Furthermore, comparison of latency transition with other halide salts demonstrated a specific chloride effect. As the halide ion radii decreasing from fluorine to iodine, it appears that Cl− must be the optimal size to bind with highest affinity to the site. Because chloride is the most abundant anionic ion under physiological conditions, this seems reasonable and suggests that this chloride site has a relevant physiological function.The Divalent Metal SitesThe fact that two divalent cation sites are found in the crystal structure (Fig. 3) was surprising because no metal ions were added intentionally to the crystallization drops. Thus, the metals appear to associate with the protein either during purification or from trace elements present in the high salt concentration crystal conditions. It is debatable whether one or both of the metal sites are opportunistic, because they are present only at the dimer interface of the asymmetric unit. It thus remains an open question at which stage the metal ions are bound. The Zn2+ site at the N terminus of molecule chain A provides a plausible explanation for the fact that monomeric PAI-1 can be purified by divalent cation affinity chromatography without the use of specific protein tags (34Day, D. D. (March 21, 2006) U. S. Patent 7,015,021 B2.Google Scholar). It is feasible that the metal chelating carboxyl groups of a metal-chelating Sepharose resin replace the metal ion coordination of Glu212 in chain A (Fig. 3), thereby mediating binding of PAI-1 through the two N-terminal histidine residues. It should be noted that adding submicromolar concentrations of either divalent zinc or copper ions to the crystallization drops caused immediate precipitation, supporting a specific interaction of the metals with PAI-1. This specific metal binding that leads to a conformational change may be relevant to recently published work that shows a destabilization of the active conformation of PAI-1 by copper, nickel, or cobalt and metal effects that are modulated by vitronectin binding to PAI-1 (32Thompson L.C. Goswami S. Ginsberg D.S. Day D.E. Verhamme I.M. Peterson C.B. Protein Sci. 2011; 20: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33Thompson L.C. Goswami S. Peterson C.B. Protein Sci. 2011; 20: 366-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).ConclusionThe initial and final structures of latency transition are now well described by our x-ray crystal structure of the metastable active PAI-1 W175F and the latent wild type PAI-1 structure (PDB 1LJ5). This structure for W175F reveals differences in secondary structural elements in the breach region and the region involving Helix F and the loop connecting to s3A in the underlying central β-sheet. Thus, our present structure of W175F PAI-1 has revealed important differences from the 14-1B structure in the very region that houses three of the four mutations that appear to lead to the thermostability of the 14-1B form. Furthermore, the change in structure is found near the flexible joint region that constitutes the binding site for the somatomedin B domain from vitronectin, a cofactor that regulates the novel latency transition of PAI-1. A change in such a key region for PAI-1 function substantiates the need for a structure that more closely represents the active metastable form of PAI-1. Clearly, the movement of individual residues and individual secondary structural elements during the latency transition still remains to be established. With these new insights, the structure of W175F PAI-1 provides an improved and updated model of active PAI-1 that will better guide mapping of interaction surfaces, molecular mechanics, and in silico modeling. IntroductionPlasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) 4The abbreviations used are: PAI-1plasminogen activator inhibitor-1DSCdifferential scanning calorimetryRCLreactive center looptPAtissue type plasminogen activatorMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidPDBProtein Data Bank. is a specific and fast-acting inhibitor of each of the two plasminogen activators, tissue type (tPA) and urokinase type plasminogen activator and thus an inhibitor of plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis and tissue remodeling. Since its discovery in the mid-1980s, this member of the serpin family has been intensely studied to achieve an in-depth understanding of its physiological and pathophysiological functions (for a review see Ref. 1Dupont D.M. Madsen J.B. Kristensen T. Bodker J.S. Blouse G.E. Wind T. Andreasen P.A. Front. Biosci. 2009; 14: 1337-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). PAI-1 has been directly implicated in cardiovascular diseases and cancer and is a potential therapeutic target (for reviews see Refs. 2Gils A. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 91: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar and 3Andreasen P.A. Curr. Drug. Targets. 2007; 8: 1030-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition to the target proteases, PAI-1 also binds to endocytosis receptors of the low density lipoprotein receptor family and the extracellular matrix glycoprotein vitronectin (for a review, see Ref. 1Dupont D.M. Madsen J.B. Kristensen T. Bodker J.S. Blouse G.E. Wind T. Andreasen P.A. Front. Biosci. 2009; 14: 1337-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To better understand these molecular interactions, many loss-of-function or loss-of-interaction mutants have been constructed (4De Taeye B. Gils A. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 92: 898-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Central to the protease inhibition mechanism is the 20-residue surface-exposed loop called the reactive center loop (RCL) that initially interacts with the target serine protease in the same way as a substrate. Following the initial protease cleavage, the N-terminal part of the RCL inserts as strand 4 in β-sheet A (s4A), the central sheet in PAI-1, translocating the covalently linked protease to the opposite pole of the serpin and thereby trapping it in an inactive covalent complex. The insertion of the RCL into β-sheet A is believed to release energy needed to drive the inhibitory mechanism, converting the serpin into the thermodynamically most stable form (5Ye S. Cech A.L. Belmares R. Bergstrom R.C. Tong Y. Corey D.R. Kanost M.R. Goldsmith E.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 979-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Under certain conditions, PAI-1 exhibits “substrate behavior,” during which the active protease is prematurely released prior to RCL insertion, leaving the serpin in an inactive protease-cleaved form (for reviews, see Refs. 1Dupont D.M. Madsen J.B. Kristensen T. Bodker J.S. Blouse G.E. Wind T. Andreasen P.A. Front. Biosci. 2009; 14: 1337-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar and 4De Taeye B. Gils A. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 92: 898-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).PAI-1 shares a unique functional feature among less than a handful of serpins in its ability to spontaneously insert the RCL into β-sheet A without prior cleavage with a half-life of 1–2 h at 37 °C, resulting in a thermodynamically more stable and noninhibitory state, termed the latent form (7Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The physiological function of latency transition is still uncertain but may serve as a protection against long term anti-fibrinolytic actions of PAI-1. Latency transition adds an experimental challenge for time extensive in vitro and in vivo assays on PAI-1 or when growing protein crystals.In 1995, a quadruply mutated (N150H, K154T, Q319L, and M354I) PAI-1 termed 14-1B was isolated by random mutagenesis screens. The conversion of 14-1B to the latent state at 37 °C was delayed by more than 70-fold. In addition, 14-1B exhibits a large increase in thermodynamic stability, manifested by a 10 °C increase in the denaturation temperature (8Berkenpas M.B. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first x-ray crystal structure of active PAI-1 was determined with 14-1B at a resolution of 3 Å (9Sharp A.M. Stein P.E. Pannu N.S. Carrell R.W. Berkenpas M.B. Ginsburg D. Lawrence D.A. Read R.J. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 111-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The structure featured the same overall fold as other inhibitory serpins (for a review, see Ref. 10Gettins P.G. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). Higher resolution structures of active 14-1B have since been determined (see supplemental Table S1), with resolutions of 2.7 (11Nar H. Bauer M. Stassen J.M. Lang D. Gils A. Declerck P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 683-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and 2.4 Å (12Stout T.J. Graham H. Buckley D.I. Matthews D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8460-8469Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), respectively. Because 14-1B retained inhibitory activity toward the target proteases, the x-ray crystal structure analysis of 14-1B has provided the basis for many biochemical investigations of active PAI-1, including the mapping of sites for molecular interactions and interpreting functional effects caused by single or multiple mutations in PAI-1 (4De Taeye B. Gils A. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 92: 898-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, accumulating evidence has raised questions about the validity of using 14-1B as a valid representative of the wild type protein (13Hägglöf P. Bergström F. Wilczynska M. Johansson L.B. Ny T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14Li S.H. Gorlatova N.V. Lawrence D.A. Schwartz B.S. J. Biol.

As examples, 14-1B was observed to differ from native PAI-1 when analyzing the binding of a set of conformational specific antibodies (14Li S.H. Gorlatova N.V. Lawrence D.A. Schwartz B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18147-18157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and when studying the ability of PAI-1 to induce multimerization of its cofactor vitronectin (16Schar C.R. Blouse G.E. Minor K.H. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10297-10309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).In a study designed to dissect the contributions to the intrinsic fluorescence from each of the four Trp residues in human PAI-1, Trp175, which is highly conserved among serpins, was substituted with a Phe. In addition to a small increase in substrate behavior when reacting with tPA and an only 3.5-fold delayed latency transition (t½ = ∼7 h, 37 °C), W175F behaved similarly to wild type PAI-1 with regard to all tested biochemical functions (17Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Kvassman J.O. Yunus S. Thompson J.H. Betts R.L. Lutter L.C. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12260-12272Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The mutated residue is centered in the “breach” region, where β-sheet A opens to allow the insertion of the first residue of the RCL. Residue 175 was shown to be important for the regulation of the rate of insertion of the first few residues of the RCL (17Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Kvassman J.O. Yunus S. Thompson J.H. Betts R.L. Lutter L.C. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12260-12272Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Here we report the crystal structure of PAI-1 W175F at 2.3 Å resolution. We were able to identify a previously unknown chloride site that leads to a revised hypothesis of how elevated salt concentrations stabilize the inhibitory activity of PAI-1. Furthermore, two novel binding sites for Zn2+ were identified that likely contribute to the reported affinity of PAI-1 for divalent metal ions. We demonstrate that W175F PAI-1 has a thermodynamic stability comparable with that of active wild type PAI-1. In accordance with this, the structural analysis provides evidence that a single substitution does not impose significant structural deviations from the wild type conformation. Comparison with the current structural model of active PAI-1 reveals significant structural differences with biochemical implications. We believe that our new structure represents a correct model for the metastable active form of PAI-1, thus providing some missing key information that enhances the structural characterization of the active form. Our observations also provide evidence that the thermodynamic stability of serpins is not the only determinant of the rate of RCL insertion."
https://openalex.org/W1968801645,"The methionine chain-elongation pathway is required for aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis in plants and evolved from leucine biosynthesis. In Arabidopsis thaliana, three 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenases (AtIPMDHs) play key roles in methionine chain-elongation for the synthesis of aliphatic glucosinolates (e.g. AtIPMDH1) and leucine (e.g. AtIPMDH2 and AtIPMDH3). Here we elucidate the molecular basis underlying the metabolic specialization of these enzymes. The 2.25 Å resolution crystal structure of AtIPMDH2 was solved to provide the first detailed molecular architecture of a plant IPMDH. Modeling of 3-isopropylmalate binding in the AtIPMDH2 active site and sequence comparisons of prokaryotic and eukaryotic IPMDH suggest that substitution of one active site residue may lead to altered substrate specificity and metabolic function. Site-directed mutagenesis of Phe-137 to a leucine in AtIPMDH1 (AtIPMDH1-F137L) reduced activity toward 3-(2′-methylthio)ethylmalate by 200-fold, but enhanced catalytic efficiency with 3-isopropylmalate to levels observed with AtIPMDH2 and AtIPMDH3. Conversely, the AtIPMDH2-L134F and AtIPMDH3-L133F mutants enhanced catalytic efficiency with 3-(2′-methylthio)ethylmalate ∼100-fold and reduced activity for 3-isopropylmalate. Furthermore, the altered in vivo glucosinolate profile of an Arabidopsis ipmdh1 T-DNA knock-out mutant could be restored to wild-type levels by constructs expressing AtIPMDH1, AtIPMDH2-L134F, or AtIPMDH3-L133F, but not by AtIPMDH1-F137L. These results indicate that a single amino acid substitution results in functional divergence of IPMDH in planta to affect substrate specificity and contributes to the evolution of specialized glucosinolate biosynthesis from the ancestral leucine pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2094972386,"Protein-arginine methyltransferases aid in the regulation of many biological processes by methylating specific arginyl groups within targeted proteins. The varied nature of the response to methylation is due in part to the diverse product specificity displayed by the protein-arginine methyltransferases. In addition to site location within a protein, biological response is also determined by the degree (mono-/dimethylation) and type of arginine dimethylation (asymmetric/symmetric). Here, we have identified two strictly conserved methionine residues in the PRMT1 active site that are not only important for activity but also control substrate specificity. Mutation of Met-155 or Met-48 results in a loss in activity and a change in distribution of mono- and dimethylated products. The altered substrate specificity of M155A and M48L mutants is also evidenced by automethylation. Investigation into the mechanistic basis of altered substrate recognition led us to consider each methyl transfer step separately. Single turnover experiments reveal that the rate of transfer of the second methyl group is much slower than transfer of the first methyl group in M48L, especially for arginine residues located in the center of the peptide substrate where turnover of the monomethylated species is negligible. Thus, altered product specificity in M48L originates from the differential effect of the mutation on the two rates. Characterization of the two active-site methionines provides the first insight into how the PRMT1 active site is engineered to control product specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1991186761,"The bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP1)-like metalloproteinases play key roles in extracellular matrix formation, by converting precursors into mature functional proteins involved in forming the extracellular matrix. The BMP1-like proteinases also play roles in activating growth factors, such as BMP2/4, myostatin, growth differentiation factor 11, and transforming growth factor β1, by cleaving extracellular antagonists. The extracellular insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs) are involved in regulating the effects of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) on growth, development, and metabolism. Of the six IGFBPs, IGFBP3 has the greatest interaction with the large pool of circulating IGFs. It is also produced locally in tissues and is itself regulated by proteolytic processing. Here, we show that BMP1 cleaves human and mouse IGFBP3 at a single conserved site, resulting in markedly reduced ability of cleaved IGFBP3 to bind IGF-I or to block IGF-I-induced cell signaling. In contrast, such cleavage is shown to result in enhanced IGF-I-independent ability of cleaved IGFBP3 to block FGF-induced proliferation and to induce Smad phosphorylation. Consistent with in vivo roles for such cleavage, it is shown that, whereas wild type mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) produce cleaved IGFBP3, MEFs doubly null for the Bmp1 gene and for the Tll1 gene, which encodes the related metalloproteinase mammalian Tolloid-like 1 (mTLL1), produce only unprocessed IGFBP3, thus demonstrating endogenous BMP1-related proteinases to be responsible for IGFBP3-processing activity in MEFs. Similarly, in zebrafish embryos, overexpression of Bmp1a is shown to reverse an Igfbp3-induced phenotype, consistent with the ability of BMP1-like proteinases to cleave IGFBP3 in vivo."

IntroductionFatty acids are essential molecules that act as energy suppliers, building blocks of membrane lipids, signaling molecules, and precursors for lipid mediators. Fatty acids are hydrophobic molecules that must be solubilized and transported within the cell by intracellular lipid chaperones known as fatty acid-binding proteins (FABP) 2The abbreviations used are: FABPfatty acid-binding proteinDAUDA11-((5-dansyl)amino)undecanoic acidLBPlipid-binding proteinTGtriglyceridePPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorSAsteric acid.

These low molecular mass (14–15 kDa) polypeptides are conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans and are involved in fatty acid uptake, transport, and oxidation (5Maatman R.G. van Moerkerk H.T. Nooren I.M. van Zoelen E.J. Veerkamp J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1214: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 6Furuhashi M. Hotamisligil G.S. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2008; 7: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). FABPs are abundant in tissues that either require large fluxes of fatty acids or have high demand for fatty acids as an energy source. Because fatty acid influx and efflux are essential for all tissues, FABPs are thought to be necessary for intracellular uptake and transport of fatty acids to target tissues. They are also involved in targeting fatty acids to specific metabolic pathways, regulation of gene expression, and cell growth (7Haunerland N.H. Spener F. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 328-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar).In mammals, FABPs are members of the superfamily of intracellular lipid-binding proteins (LBP). To date, four subfamilies of intracellular LBPs with tissue-specific distribution have been identified (8Ross A.C. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 9Di Pietro S.M. Veerkamp J.H. Santomé J.A. Eur. J.

FABPs bind both saturated and unsaturated long-chain (≥14 C) FA with high affinity (12Storch J. Thumser A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 28-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The presence of intracellular FABPs increases the solubility of fatty acids and may create a larger cytosolic fatty acid pool that enhances substrate availability to fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes. As lipid chaperones, FABPs may actively facilitate the transport of lipids to specific compartments in the cell for fat storage (lipid droplets), signaling (endoplasmic reticulum), and membrane synthesis (6Furuhashi M. Hotamisligil G.S. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2008; 7: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar, 7Haunerland N.H. Spener F. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 328-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In so doing, they impact systemic energy homeostasis (13Storch J. McDermott L. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: S126-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Studies have also shown that FABPs (e.g. FABP4 and FABP5) can have synergistic functions in specific nutritional conditions, and deliver specific fatty acids to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) for their transcriptional activation (14Michalik L. Wahli W. PPAR Res. 2008; 2008: 134059Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 15Tan N.S. Shaw N.S. Vinckenbosch N. Liu P. Yasmin R. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Noy N. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 5114-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). However, despite the fact that most tissues express several FABP isoforms, regulation of their tissue-specific expression and functions remain poorly understood.A functional relationship exists between FABPs and PPARs in mammals. FABPs regulate the activity of PPARs, a process associated with lipid signaling in inflammation and cancer. Fatty acids, triglycerides, and phospholipids act as substrates to generate PPAR ligands, which are guided to their receptors by cytoplasmic FABPs. PPARs translate these lipid signals into responses that work to maintain energy homeostasis (14Michalik L. Wahli W. PPAR Res. 2008; 2008: 134059Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For example, FABP1 (liver FABP) has been hypothesized to be involved in enterocyte lipid absorption, as well as hepatocyte lipid transport and lipoprotein metabolism. FABP1 delivers PPAR ligands to the nucleus to modulate PPAR-α and PPAR-γ gene expression (16Wolfrum C. Borrmann C.M. Borchers T. Spener F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 2323-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). More examples have been reported for FABP4 and -5 (7Haunerland N.H. Spener F. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 328-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 15Tan N.S. Shaw N.S. Vinckenbosch N. Liu P. Yasmin R. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Noy N. Mol.

Nematodes are one of the most abundant and ecologically diverse groups of multicellular organisms. Their parasitic forms cause human disease and economic damage to domestic animals and crops. FABPs in the nematode, which are known as LBPs, have attracted much research interest because of their potential roles in nutrient acquisition, manipulation of host tissues, and countering host defense reactions (18Kennedy M.W. Harnett W. Parasitic Nematodes: Molecular Biology, Biochemistry and Immunology. CABI Publishing, New York2001: 309-330Google Scholar, 19Kennedy M.W. Biochim. Biophys.

The C. elegans genome contains nine LBP genes, lbp-1 to lbp-9 (21Plenefisch J. Xiao H. Mei B. Geng J. Komuniecki P.R. Komuniecki R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The function of these LBPs in fat metabolism or survival during the dauer stage of C. elegans development remains unknown.Mammalian PPAR-α and C. elegans NHR-49, which is a homologue of mammalian HNF-4 (22Van Gilst M.R. Hadjivassiliou H. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13496-13501Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), regulate the transcription of similar target genes including genes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, lipid binding, and fatty acid desaturation (22Van Gilst M.R.

Inhibition of either NHR-49 in C. elegans, or PPAR family members in mice, enhances fat storage (22Van Gilst M.R. Hadjivassiliou H. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13496-13501Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 25Costet P. Legendre C. Moré J. Edgar A. Galtier P. Pineau T. J. Biol.

Cell. 2003; 113: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). In addition, NHR-49 is a major regulator of fat-5, -6, and -7, and fat-7 has been reported to be regulated by at least five different transcriptional regulators (27Watts J.L. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 20: 58-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). By convention, NHR-49 is also called a functional homolog of PPAR-α (22Van Gilst M.R. Hadjivassiliou H. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13496-13501Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).To further understand fat metabolism in C. elegans, which is essential for their survival throughout the life cycle, we identified the lbp genes and characterized their regulation. Because lbp-5 knockdown caused the accumulation of large deposits of body fat, we focused on the role of LBP-5 regulation in fat metabolism. Here, we show that LBP-5 contributes to fat storage and fatty acid β-oxidation by cooperating with NHR-49 to modulate the expression of fatty acid metabolic genes.DISCUSSIONThe data presented in this study reveal novel functions of LBP-5 in C. elegans. First, among the lbp family members, only lbp-5(RNAi) worms displayed significant fat accumulation (supplemental Fig. S3A). This was confirmed by the lbp-5(tm1618) mutant, suggesting that lbp-5 is important for fat metabolism and storage in C. elegans. Second, fat accumulation peaked as lbp-5 expression reached its lowest level in dauer larvae (supplemental Fig. S10), which are in a special dormant state (33Jeong P.Y. Jung M. Yim Y.H. Kim H. Park M. Hong E. Lee W. Kim Y.H. Kim K. Paik Y.K. Nature. 2005; 433: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 34Jeong P.Y. Kwon M.S. Joo H.J. Paik Y.K.

Genetic and Environmental Regulation of Dauer Larva Development. Vol. 26. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 739-768Google Scholar). This suggests that lbp-5 expression is functionally linked to fatty acid energy metabolism and fat storage (34Jeong P.Y. Kwon M.S. Joo H.J. Paik Y.K. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4162Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because recent studies have shown that Nile Red staining of live nematodes often does not correlate with actual fat stores (36Soukas A.A. Kane E.A. Carr C.E. Melo J.A. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 496-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 37Brooks K.K. Liang B. Watts J.L. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e7545Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 38Mörck C. Olsen L. Kurth C. Persson A. Storm N.J. Svensson E. Jansson J.O. Hellqvist M. Enejder A. Faergeman N.J. Pilon M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18285-18290Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we performed Sudan Black staining of fixed worms to examine fat accumulation. We also confirmed our results by measuring TG content (Fig. 1). Structural analysis of recombinant LBP-5 by examination of CD spectra (Fig. 2A) revealed a β-sheet-rich structure that is conserved in C. elegans LBP-5 and mammalian FABPs (39Chmurzyńska A. J. Appl. Genet. 2006; 47: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). This indicates that the fatty acid binding and transfer properties are also likely to be conserved. Our binding assay results using DAUDA support this conclusion by showing that LBP-5 binds differentially to fatty acids with different chain lengths and saturation conditions, and may also function in fatty acid transport. Interestingly, the effects of ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids on NHR-49 were independent of LBP-5 (supplemental Fig. S9).It appears that LBP-5 and NHR-49 have a functional partnership in regulation of energy metabolism. Several lines of evidence supports this notion. First, LBP-5 was localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 3). Second, lbp-5 gene expression was heavily dependent on the presence of NHR-49 (Fig. 4). Third, NHR-49 target genes involved in mitochondrial β-oxidation appeared to be influenced by lbp-5, because expression of most of the NHR-49 target genes was reduced when lbp-5 gene expression was disrupted (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. S6). This is consistent with the observation that inhibition of either nhr-49 or lbp-5 in C. elegans lead to increased fat storage (22Van Gilst M.R. Hadjivassiliou H. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13496-13501Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 25Costet P. Legendre C. Moré J. Edgar A. Galtier P. Pineau T. J. Biol.

Cell. 2003; 113: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Our stearic acid binding assay results support that stearic acid-stimulated NHR-49 target gene expression is also dependent on the presence of LBP-5 (Fig. 5, B and C).It is worth noting that in the stearic acid-mediated LBP-5 and NHR-49 activation models (Fig. 6), the effect of NHR-49 transcriptional activity on the fatty acid desaturase genes (fat-5, -6, and -7) was more significant than on those related to mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation (data not shown). In addition, stearic acid feeding also caused a dramatic increase in gei-7 and sdha-2 expression. Thus, it appears that LBP-5 may have dual functions as an SA carrier and an important mediator of SA-induced expression of NHR-49 target genes. Taken together, our data revealed a dual role for LBP-5 (e.g. stearic acid carrier and a functional partner of NHR-49) in regulating fat metabolism in response to fatty acid ligands such as stearic acid. However, further study is needed to determine how these two proteins work together to regulate genes involved in lipid metabolism.This newly explored functional partnership between LBP-5 and NHR-49 may prevent the storage of “bad” fatty acids. One probable mechanism underlying the regulatory function of this proposed partnership is that specific ligands, such as stearic acid, may bind to LBP-5 and then enter the nucleus to stimulate NHR-49 transcriptional activity (Fig. 6). In support of this, stearic acid stimulates LBP-5-dependent induction of polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis while also functioning as a polyunsaturated fatty acid precursor. Consequently, up-regulation of the fat-5, -6, and -7 genes may help maintain stearic acid levels in feeding conditions by converting saturated fatty acids into unsaturated fatty acids, which are more suitable for fat storage and thereby prevent saturated fat accumulation.In conclusion, our study introduces a novel functional relationship between the key regulators, LBP-5 and NHR-49, of fatty acid metabolism in C. elegans (Fig. 6). This partnership may regulate target genes during fatty acid metabolism and transport to organelles in response to changes in physiological conditions (e.g. dauer state). Because the fundamental mechanisms of lipid metabolism and transport are likely to be evolutionarily conserved, understanding the function of LBP-5 is useful for predicting the functions of mammalian FABPs. Such work may help identify therapeutic targets for a range of associated disorders including obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Furthermore, our work can be applied to identification of anti-nematodal agents for pathogenic plant host nematodes (e.g. pinewood nematode) (40Oh W.S. Jeong P.Y. Joo H.J. Lee J.E. Moon Y.S.

IntroductionFatty acids are essential molecules that act as energy suppliers, building blocks of membrane lipids, signaling molecules, and precursors for lipid mediators.

These low molecular mass (14–15 kDa) polypeptides are conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans and are involved in fatty acid uptake, transport, and oxidation (5Maatman R.G. van Moerkerk H.T.

Drug Discov. 2008; 7: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). FABPs are abundant in tissues that either require large fluxes of fatty acids or have high demand for fatty acids as an energy source. Because fatty acid influx and efflux are essential for all tissues, FABPs are thought to be necessary for intracellular uptake and transport of fatty acids to target tissues. They are also involved in targeting fatty acids to specific metabolic pathways, regulation of gene expression, and cell growth (7Haunerland N.H. Spener F. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 328-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar).In mammals, FABPs are members of the superfamily of intracellular lipid-binding proteins (LBP). To date, four subfamilies of intracellular LBPs with tissue-specific distribution have been identified (8Ross A.C. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 9Di Pietro S.M. Veerkamp J.H. Santomé J.A. Eur. J.

FABPs bind both saturated and unsaturated long-chain (≥14 C) FA with high affinity (12Storch J. Thumser A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 28-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The presence of intracellular FABPs increases the solubility of fatty acids and may create a larger cytosolic fatty acid pool that enhances substrate availability to fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes. As lipid chaperones, FABPs may actively facilitate the transport of lipids to specific compartments in the cell for fat storage (lipid droplets), signaling (endoplasmic reticulum), and membrane synthesis (6Furuhashi M. Hotamisligil G.S. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2008; 7: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar, 7Haunerland N.H. Spener F. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 328-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In so doing, they impact systemic energy homeostasis (13Storch J. McDermott L. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: S126-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Studies have also shown that FABPs (e.g. FABP4 and FABP5) can have synergistic functions in specific nutritional conditions, and deliver specific fatty acids to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) for their transcriptional activation (14Michalik L. Wahli W. PPAR Res. 2008; 2008: 134059Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 15Tan N.S. Shaw N.S. Vinckenbosch N. Liu P. Yasmin R. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Noy N. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 5114-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). However, despite the fact that most tissues express several FABP isoforms, regulation of their tissue-specific expression and functions remain poorly understood.A functional relationship exists between FABPs and PPARs in mammals. FABPs regulate the activity of PPARs, a process associated with lipid signaling in inflammation and cancer. Fatty acids, triglycerides, and phospholipids act as substrates to generate PPAR ligands, which are guided to their receptors by cytoplasmic FABPs. PPARs translate these lipid signals into responses that work to maintain energy homeostasis (14Michalik L. Wahli W. PPAR Res. 2008; 2008: 134059Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For example, FABP1 (liver FABP) has been hypothesized to be involved in enterocyte lipid absorption, as well as hepatocyte lipid transport and lipoprotein metabolism. FABP1 delivers PPAR ligands to the nucleus to modulate PPAR-α and PPAR-γ gene expression (16Wolfrum C. Borrmann C.M. Borchers T. Spener F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Harnett W. Parasitic Nematodes: Molecular Biology, Biochemistry and Immunology. CABI Publishing, New York2001: 309-330Google Scholar, 19Kennedy M.W. Biochim. Biophys.

Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 471-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the exact function of individual LBPs in nematodes remains unclear. The C. elegans genome contains nine LBP genes, lbp-1 to lbp-9 (21Plenefisch J. Xiao H. Mei B. Geng J. Komuniecki P.R. Komuniecki R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The function of these LBPs in fat metabolism or survival during the dauer stage of C. elegans development remains unknown. Mammalian PPAR-α and C. elegans NHR-49, which is a homologue of mammalian HNF-4 (22Van Gilst M.R. Hadjivassiliou H. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13496-13501Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), regulate the transcription of similar target genes including genes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, lipid binding, and fatty acid desaturation (22Van Gilst M.R.

Inhibition of either NHR-49 in C. elegans, or PPAR family members in mice, enhances fat storage (22Van Gilst M.R. Hadjivassiliou H. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell. 2003; 113: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). In addition, NHR-49 is a major regulator of fat-5, -6, and -7, and fat-7 has been reported to be regulated by at least five different transcriptional regulators (27Watts J.L. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 20: 58-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). By convention, NHR-49 is also called a functional homolog of PPAR-α (22Van Gilst M.R. Hadjivassiliou H. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13496-13501Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To further understand fat metabolism in C. elegans, which is essential for their survival throughout the life cycle, we identified the lbp genes and characterized their regulation. Because lbp-5 knockdown caused the accumulation of large deposits of body fat, we focused on the role of LBP-5 regulation in fat metabolism. Here, we show that LBP-5 contributes to fat storage and fatty acid β-oxidation by cooperating with NHR-49 to modulate the expression of fatty acid metabolic genes. DISCUSSIONThe data presented in this study reveal novel functions of LBP-5 in C. elegans. First, among the lbp family members, only lbp-5(RNAi) worms displayed significant fat accumulation (supplemental Fig. S3A). This was confirmed by the lbp-5(tm1618) mutant, suggesting that lbp-5 is important for fat metabolism and storage in C. elegans. Second, fat accumulation peaked as lbp-5 expression reached its lowest level in dauer larvae (supplemental Fig. S10), which are in a special dormant state (33Jeong P.Y. Jung M. Yim Y.H. Kim H.

Genetic and Environmental Regulation of Dauer Larva Development. Vol. 26. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 739-768Google Scholar). This suggests that lbp-5 expression is functionally linked to fatty acid energy metabolism and fat storage (34Jeong P.Y. Kwon M.S. Joo H.J. Paik Y.K. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4162Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because recent studies have shown that Nile Red staining of live nematodes often does not correlate with actual fat stores (36Soukas A.A. Kane E.A. Carr C.E. Melo J.A. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 496-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 37Brooks K.K. Liang B. Watts J.L. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e7545Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 38Mörck C. Olsen L.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18285-18290Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we performed Sudan Black staining of fixed worms to examine fat accumulation. We also confirmed our results by measuring TG content (Fig. 1). Structural analysis of recombinant LBP-5 by examination of CD spectra (Fig. 2A) revealed a β-sheet-rich structure that is conserved in C. elegans LBP-5 and mammalian FABPs (39Chmurzyńska A. J. Appl. Genet. 2006; 47: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). This indicates that the fatty acid binding and transfer properties are also likely to be conserved. Our binding assay results using DAUDA support this conclusion by showing that LBP-5 binds differentially to fatty acids with different chain lengths and saturation conditions, and may also function in fatty acid transport. Interestingly, the effects of ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids on NHR-49 were independent of LBP-5 (supplemental Fig. S9).It appears that LBP-5 and NHR-49 have a functional partnership in regulation of energy metabolism. Several lines of evidence supports this notion. First, LBP-5 was localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 3). Second, lbp-5 gene expression was heavily dependent on the presence of NHR-49 (Fig. 4). Third, NHR-49 target genes involved in mitochondrial β-oxidation appeared to be influenced by lbp-5, because expression of most of the NHR-49 target genes was reduced when lbp-5 gene expression was disrupted (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. S6). This is consistent with the observation that inhibition of either nhr-49 or lbp-5 in C. elegans lead to increased fat storage (22Van Gilst M.R. Hadjivassiliou H. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13496-13501Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 25Costet P. Legendre C. Moré J. Edgar A. Galtier P. Pineau T. J. Biol.

Our stearic acid binding assay results support that stearic acid-stimulated NHR-49 target gene expression is also dependent on the presence of LBP-5 (Fig. 5, B and C).It is worth noting that in the stearic acid-mediated LBP-5 and NHR-49 activation models (Fig. 6), the effect of NHR-49 transcriptional activity on the fatty acid desaturase genes (fat-5, -6, and -7) was more significant than on those related to mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation (data not shown). In addition, stearic acid feeding also caused a dramatic increase in gei-7 and sdha-2 expression. Thus, it appears that LBP-5 may have dual functions as an SA carrier and an important mediator of SA-induced expression of NHR-49 target genes. Taken together, our data revealed a dual role for LBP-5 (e.g. stearic acid carrier and a functional partner of NHR-49) in regulating fat metabolism in response to fatty acid ligands such as stearic acid. However, further study is needed to determine how these two proteins work together to regulate genes involved in lipid metabolism.This newly explored functional partnership between LBP-5 and NHR-49 may prevent the storage of “bad” fatty acids. One probable mechanism underlying the regulatory function of this proposed partnership is that specific ligands, such as stearic acid, may bind to LBP-5 and then enter the nucleus to stimulate NHR-49 transcriptional activity (Fig. 6). In support of this, stearic acid stimulates LBP-5-dependent induction of polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis while also functioning as a polyunsaturated fatty acid precursor. Consequently, up-regulation of the fat-5, -6, and -7 genes may help maintain stearic acid levels in feeding conditions by converting saturated fatty acids into unsaturated fatty acids, which are more suitable for fat storage and thereby prevent saturated fat accumulation.In conclusion, our study introduces a novel functional relationship between the key regulators, LBP-5 and NHR-49, of fatty acid metabolism in C. elegans (Fig. 6). This partnership may regulate target genes during fatty acid metabolism and transport to organelles in response to changes in physiological conditions (e.g. dauer state). Because the fundamental mechanisms of lipid metabolism and transport are likely to be evolutionarily conserved, understanding the function of LBP-5 is useful for predicting the functions of mammalian FABPs. Such work may help identify therapeutic targets for a range of associated disorders including obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Furthermore, our work can be applied to identification of anti-nematodal agents for pathogenic plant host nematodes (e.g. pinewood nematode) (40Oh W.S. Jeong P.Y. Joo H.J. Lee J.E. Moon Y.S.

https://openalex.org/W2061973101,"CYP24A1 is a mitochondrial cytochrome P450 (CYP) that catabolizes 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1α,25-(OH)(2)D(3)) to different products: calcitroic acid or 1α,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-26,23-lactone via multistep pathways commencing with C24 and C23 hydroxylation, respectively. Despite the ability of CYP24A1 to catabolize a wide range of 25-hydroxylated analogs including 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3), the enzyme is unable to metabolize the synthetic prodrug, 1α-hydroxyvitamin D(3) (1α-OH-D(3)), presumably because it lacks a C25-hydroxyl. In the current study we show that a single V391L amino acid substitution in the β3a-strand of human CYP24A1 converts this enzyme from a catabolic 1α,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-24-hydroxylase into an anabolic 1α-OH-D(3)-25-hydroxylase, thereby forming the hormone, 1α,25-(OH)(2)D(3). Furthermore, because the mutant enzyme retains its basal ability to catabolize 1α,25-(OH)(2)D(3) via C24 hydroxylation, it can also make calcitroic acid. Previous work has shown that an A326G mutation is responsible for the regioselectivity differences observed between human (primarily C24-hydroxylating) and opossum (C23-hydroxylating) CYP24A1. When the V391L and A326G mutations were combined (V391L/A326G), the mutant enzyme continued to form 1α,25-(OH)(2)D(3) from 1α-OH-D(3), but this initial product was diverted via the C23 hydroxylation pathway into the 26,23-lactone. The relative position of Val-391 in the β3a-strand of a homology model and the crystal structure of rat CYP24A1 is consistent with hydrophobic contact of Val-391 and the substrate side chain near C21. We interpret that the substrate specificity of V391L-modified human CYP24A1 toward 1α-OH-D(3) is enabled by an altered contact with the substrate side chain that optimally positions C25 of the 1α-OH-D(3) above the heme for hydroxylation."

https://openalex.org/W1972631552,"Bats typically emit multi harmonic calls. Their head morphology shapes the emission and hearing sound fields as a function of frequency. Therefore, the sound fields are markedly different for the various harmonics. As the sound field provides bats with all necessary cues to locate objects in space, different harmonics might provide them with variable amounts of information about the location of objects. Also, the ability to locate objects in different parts of the frontal hemisphere might vary across harmonics. This paper evaluates this hypothesis in R. rouxi, using an information theoretic framework. We estimate the reflector position information transfer in the echolocation system of R. rouxi as a function of frequency. This analysis shows that localization performance reaches a global minimum and a global maximum at the two most energetic frequency components of R. rouxi call indicating tuning of morphology and harmonic structure. Using the fundamental the bat is able to locate objects in a large portion of the frontal hemisphere. In contrast, using the 1 overtone, it can only locate objects, albeit with a slightly higher accuracy, in a small portion of the frontal hemisphere by reducing sensitivity to echoes from outside this region of interest. Hence, different harmonic components provide the bat either with a wide view or a focused view of its environment. We propose these findings can be interpreted in the context of the foraging behaviour of R. rouxi, i.e., hunting in cluttered environments. Indeed, the focused view provided by the 1 overtone suggests that at this frequency its morphology is tuned for clutter rejection and accurate localization in a small region of interest while the finding that overall localization performance is best at the fundamental indicates that the morphology is simultaneously tuned to optimize overall localization performance at this frequency."

Here, we tested the hypothesis that flexor and extensor interneuronal networks for walking are physically segregated in the lumbar spinal cord. For this purpose, we performed optical recordings and lesion experiments from a horizontally sectioned lumbar spinal cord isolated from neonate rats. This ventral hemi spinal cord preparation produces well-organized fictive locomotion when superfused with 5-HT/NMDA. The dorsal surface of the preparation was visualized using the Ca2+ indicator fluo-4 AM, while simultaneously monitoring motor output at ventral roots L2 and L5. Using calcium imaging, we provided a general mapping view of the interneurons that maintained a stable phase relationship with motor output. We showed that the dorsal surface of L1 segment contains a higher density of locomotor rhythmic cells than the other segments. Moreover, L1 segment lesioning induced the most important changes in the locomotor activity in comparison with lesions at the T13 or L2 segments. However, no lesions led to selective disruption of either flexor or extensor output. In addition, this study found no evidence of functional parcellation of locomotor interneurons into flexor and extensor pools at the dorsal-ventral midline of the lumbar spinal cord of the rat."
https://openalex.org/W2018221205,"Escherichia coli dinD is an SOS gene up-regulated in response to DNA damage. We find that the purified DinD protein is a novel inhibitor of RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange activities. Most modulators of RecA protein activity act by controlling the amount of RecA protein bound to single-stranded DNA by affecting either the loading of RecA protein onto DNA or the disassembly of RecA nucleoprotein filaments bound to single-stranded DNA. The DinD protein, however, acts postsynaptically to inhibit RecA during an on-going DNA strand exchange, likely through the disassembly of RecA filaments. DinD protein does not affect RecA single-stranded DNA filaments but efficiently disassembles RecA when bound to two or more DNA strands, effectively halting RecA-mediated branch migration. By utilizing a nonspecific duplex DNA-binding protein, YebG, we show that the DinD effect is not simply due to duplex DNA sequestration. We present a model suggesting that the negative effects of DinD protein are targeted to a specific conformational state of the RecA protein and discuss the potential role of DinD protein in the regulation of recombinational DNA repair."

https://openalex.org/W1966201185,"DNA polymerases catalyze the 3'-5'-pyrophosphorolysis of a DNA primer annealed to a DNA template in the presence of pyrophosphate (PP(i)). In this reversal of the polymerization reaction, deoxynucleotides in DNA are converted to deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphates. Based on the charge, size, and geometry of the oxygen connecting the two phosphorus atoms of PP(i), a variety of compounds was examined for their ability to carry out a reaction similar to pyrophosphorolysis. We describe a manganese-mediated pyrophosphorolysis-like activity using pyrovanadate (VV) catalyzed by the DNA polymerase of bacteriophage T7. We designate this reaction pyrovanadolysis. X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals a shorter Mn-V distance of the polymerase-VV complex than the Mn-P distance of the polymerase-PP(i) complex. This structural arrangement at the active site accounts for the enzymatic activation by Mn-VV. We propose that the Mn(2+), larger than Mg(2+), fits the polymerase active site to mediate binding of VV into the active site of the polymerase. Our results may be the first documentation that vanadium can substitute for phosphorus in biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2082486277,"Recent studies have indicated that the choice of lineage of neural progenitor cells is determined, at least in part, by environmental factors, such as neurotrophic factors. Despite extensive studies using exogenous neurotrophic factors, the effect of endogenous neurotrophic factors on the differentiation of progenitor cells remains obscure. Here we show that embryonic spinal cord derived-progenitor cells express both ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA before differentiation. BDNF gene expression significantly decreases with their differentiation into the specific lineage, whereas CNTF gene expression significantly increases. The temporal pattern of neurotrophic factor gene expression in progenitor cells is similar to that of the spinal cord during postnatal development. Approximately 50% of spinal progenitor cells differentiated into astrocytes. To determine the effect of endogenous CNTF on their differentiation, we neutralized endogenous CNTF by administration of its polyclonal antibody. Neutralization of endogenous CNTF inhibited the differentiation of progenitor cells into astrocytes, but did not affect the numbers of neurons or oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, to mimic the profile of neurotrophic factors in the spinal cord during embryonic development, we applied BDNF or neurotrophin (NT)-3 exogenously in combination with the anti-CNTF antibody. The exogenous application of BDNF or NT-3 promoted the differentiation of these cells into neurons or oligodendrocytes, respectively. These findings suggest that endogenous CNTF and exogenous BDNF and NT-3 play roles in the differentiation of embryonic spinal cord derived progenitor cells into astrocytes, neurons and oligodendrocytes, respectively."

The conversion of the normal α-helical PrPC into a pathological β-en-riched PrPSc constitutes an early event in the infectious process. Several hypotheses, involving different regions of the protein, endeavor to delineate the structural mechanism underlying this change of conformation. All current working hypotheses, however, are based on biophysical and modeling studies, the biological relevance of which still needs to be assessed. We have studied the effect of positively charged polymers on the conversion, using polylysine as a model system, and have investigated a possible mechanism of structural stabilization. We have shown that poly-d-lysine removes proteinase K-resistant PrP from prion-infected SN56 neuroblastoma cells without affecting PrPC. The effect is enantiospecific since the levorotary isomer, poly-l-lysine, has a markedly weaker effect, likely because of its higher susceptibility to degradation. In vitro cross-linking and NMR studies confirm a direct interaction between polylysine and PrP, which mainly maps to the PrP region containing helices 2 and 3 (H2H3). Interaction prevents conformational conversion and protein aggregation. Our results establish a central role of H2H3 in PrPSc amyloidogenesis and replication and provide biological relevance for the pathological misfolding of this domain.—Xu, Z., Adrover, M., Pastore, A., Prigent, S., Mouthon, F., Comoy, E., Rezaei, H., Deslys, J. -P.
