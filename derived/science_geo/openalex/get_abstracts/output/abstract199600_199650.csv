https://openalex.org/W16323906,"We should like to subsume under the group designation “mucolipide” the complex lipide polymers that combine constituents commonly considered characteristic of the cerebrosides with others usually assigned to the mucoids. They are soluble in water, but also in organic solvents, and they contain fatty acid, a sphingosine-like base, a hexose, also amino sugar, sometimes amino acids, and, most significantly, sialic acid or a related substance. This has been pointed out recently in notes dealing briefly with the subject of this communication (1, 2).’ Lipides of the general type under discussion here, i.e. compounds related to the cerebrosides, but soluble in water and yielding a violet color with Bial’s reagent or a direct color reaction with p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde without previous treatment with alkali, have been encountered not infrequently in the older literature. Since what appears to be their first description, by Landsteiner and Levene (4, 5), similar substances were found in spleen (6), normal brain (7), and in the brain of cases of NiemannPick disease (8) and of Tay-Sachs disease (9). Two representatives of the mucolipide group have been investigated in some detail. (1) The “gangliosides,” a name first given to mucolipides isolated from brain tissue of instances of lipidoses (10) and later extended, perhaps without justification, to material from normal nervous and other tissues; and (2) “strandin,” a high molecular lipide complex from ox brain (11). Folch and his collaborators (11) deserve great credit for pointing out the existence in nervous tissue of a lipide derivative of high molecular weight. For the isolation of this material, they employed a much milder procedure than is customary"

Unfortunately, owing to lack of satisfactory micro- or semimicromethods for separating lipide components and determining their fatty acid composition, little has been published on the effect of dietary fatty acids on the fatty acid composition of the various body tissue lipides, although the need for these comprehensive studies has certainly been recognized. Considerable attention is being given to the development of improved methods for the purpose, and recent advancements in lipide fractionation and analysis offer promise of useful application in lipide metabolism research: elution chromatography on silicic acid columns for separating extracted lipides into their components, i.e. sterol esters, glycerides, free sterols, and phospholipides (l-3) ; reverse phase partition chromatography for fractionating mg. quantities of fatty acids (4); gas liquid partition chromatography for analytical separation and determination of mg. quantities of fatty acids (5); and a spectrophotometric micromethod for determining polyunsaturated fatty acids in mg. sized samples (6). These methods should still be considered in the developmental state, but, at least, attempts are being made to improve them. For example, Lipsky et al. (7) recently reported a modification of Borgstrom’s silicic acid column technique, Crombie"

https://openalex.org/W189312865,"Until about 5 years ago, treatment with hot alkali was the most widely used method for hydrolyzing the iodoprotein of thyroid tissue. By such a procedure, Kendall first isolated thyroxine from the thyroid glands of oxen (1). Proteolytic enzymes have also been used for this purpose with varying degrees of success, since the early work of Hutchison (a), Oswald (3), and Harington (4). More recently, the usefulness of enzymic hydrolysis has been extended considerably by combining this method for fragmenting the thyroid protein with the very sensitive techniques of chromatography and radioisotopic labeling for the isolation and identification of the products of hydrolysis. Although this combinat,ion of procedures has been used in several laboratories (5-la), a thorough study of the hydrolysis with proteases has not been reported. In our investigation of this procedure we found, in agreement with Roche et al. (7), that the iodotyrosines are released quite rapidly from the thyroprotein, whereas the release of thyroxine proceeds more slowly. In addition, we found that the yield of thyroxine can be increased by performing the hydrolysis in the presence of certain metal cations (Mn++, Mg++, Ca++). These findings are described below, along with a procedure for the analysis of 1131-labeled thyroid tissue. This procedure requires 10 to 20 hours of hydrolysis, yields approximately 95 per cent recovery of 1131 protein in the form of 1131-amino acids, and results in little release of inorganic I131."

The designation, “digestible” deoxynucleotides, refers to nucleotides which require enzymatic digestion for conversion to nucleotide monophosphates or nucleosides. It appears that, with some exceptions, the levels of the nucleotides and digestible nucleotides are higher in malignant than in normal tissue, relative to the concentration of nucleosides, and are relatively higher in regenerating liver, 24 hours postoperatively, than in the controls. The data suggest that this difference may be characteristic of growing tissue. BIBLIOGRAPHY 1. Potter, R. L., and Schlesinger, S. J., J. Am. Chem. Sot., 77, 6714 (1955). 2. Schneider, W. C., J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1964022065,"WHEN aqueous solutions containing carbon-14 compounds are dried on planchettes for assay under an end-window counter, surface tension often makes it difficult to ensure that the solids are deposited in a layer sufficiently uniform to give reproducible self-absorption and counter geometry. The essential feature of the present method is that the compound to be assayed is incorporated in a layer of gel which will dry to a perfectly even film."

Early attempts in this laboratory to demonstrate such antigens associated with rinderpest virus failed, probably because the convalescent bovine and rabbit sera used did not contain a sufficiently high concentration of antibody."

Very little is known at present about the enzymes responsible for this conversion. Shemin suggests the deamination of δ-aminolævulinic acid. Recently, Kowalski et al. 3 succeeded in demonstrating a δ-aminolævulinic acid transaminase system in mammalian tissues."

https://openalex.org/W2399987013,"Although the carbon precursor of glucosamine has been studied in many organisms (l-5), only recently has work been done on establishing the precursor of the nitrogen atom. A preliminary report from this laboratory (6) showed that ammonia was an excellent source of this nitrogen. Recent work by Leloir and Cardini (1) has shown that, in a crude enzyme system from Neurospora crassa, the amide group of L-glutamine was the precursor of the nitrogen of glucosamine. This same observation has been made in experiments with rat liver (7) and streptococci (8). Ammonia itself can also be the source of this nitrogen atom in the synthesis of glucosamine 6-phosphate by the glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase system prepared from Escherichia coli (9) and from rat and pig liver (10). In this paper are presented the details of the previously reported findings, and data are presented showing that ammonia nitrogen is a precursor of the nitrogen atom of glucosamine isolated from the ovomucoid of the chicken egg."

https://openalex.org/W1993002353,"IN 1956, the Medical Research Council Committee set up to report on the medical aspects of nuclear radiation estimated that luminous watches and clocks increased the population dose of radiation to the gonads by 1 per cent of the natural background1. This estimate was based on the assumption that the average wrist-watch contains about one-fifth of a microcurie of radium. Libby2, reporting a similar investigation, quotes a figure of 1 microcurie of radium per watch as being “perhaps slightly larger than average”."

https://openalex.org/W2030242795,RECENTLY Doniach and Roitt1 found that the sera of patients with Hashimoto's disease contained auto-antibodies to human thyroglobulin. They demonstrated this by diffusion-precipitation reactions in agar gels. Positive precipitin reactions were obtained by allowing the sera to react with saline extracts of human thyroid or purified thyroglobulin. We have investigated the possibility of using this precipitin reaction in an immuno-electrophoretic method for the demonstration of thyroglobulin in the presence of other proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2067212370,"IN the course of previous investigations1–3 it was demonstrated that following stress (administration of formalin, intensive dehydration) the number of basophil cells in the adenohypophysis of rats increased considerably. For the development of this phenomenon the presence of the adrenal gland is needed: thus if formalin stress is applied in adrenalectomized animals, basophil hyperplasia fails to develop. The importance of the adrenal cortex is also supported by the fact that cortisone treatment also increases the number of the basophils4."
