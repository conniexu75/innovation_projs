https://openalex.org/W2949380898,"The CRISPR–Cas9 system is a powerful tool for genome editing, which allows the precise modification of specific DNA sequences. Many efforts are underway to use the CRISPR–Cas9 system to therapeutically correct human genetic diseases1–6. The most widely used orthologs of Cas9 are derived from Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes5,7. Given that these two bacterial species infect the human population at high frequencies8,9, we hypothesized that humans may harbor preexisting adaptive immune responses to the Cas9 orthologs derived from these bacterial species, SaCas9 (S. aureus) and SpCas9 (S. pyogenes). By probing human serum for the presence of anti-Cas9 antibodies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we detected antibodies against both SaCas9 and SpCas9 in 78% and 58% of donors, respectively. We also found anti-SaCas9 T cells in 78% and anti-SpCas9 T cells in 67% of donors, which demonstrates a high prevalence of antigen-specific T cells against both orthologs. We confirmed that these T cells were Cas9-specific by demonstrating a Cas9-specific cytokine response following isolation, expansion, and antigen restimulation. Together, these data demonstrate that there are preexisting humoral and cell-mediated adaptive immune responses to Cas9 in humans, a finding that should be taken into account as the CRISPR–Cas9 system moves toward clinical trials. Cas9-specific antibodies and reactive T cells are found in the majority of healthy adult human serum samples analyzed. Such preexisting adaptive immunity should be taken into consideration as the CRISPR–Cas9 system moves toward clinical trials."

The prelimbic (PL) cortex, a subregion of prefrontal cortex, plays a critical role in fear memory retrieval over time. Most studies have focused on acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval of recent memories, but much less is known about the neural mechanisms of remote memory. Using a new knock-in mouse for activity-dependent genetic labeling (TRAP2), we demonstrate that neuronal ensembles in the PL cortex are dynamic. PL neurons TRAPed during later memory retrievals are more likely to be reactivated and make larger behavioral contributions to remote memory retrieval compared to those TRAPed during learning or early memory retrieval. PL activity during learning is required to initiate this time-dependent reorganization in PL ensembles underlying memory retrieval. Finally, while neurons TRAPed during earlier and later retrievals have similar broad projections throughout the brain, PL neurons TRAPed later have a stronger functional recruitment of cortical targets."

https://openalex.org/W2914346216,"Investigating human oligodendrogenesis and the interaction of oligodendrocytes with neurons and astrocytes would accelerate our understanding of the mechanisms underlying white matter disorders. However, this is challenging because of the limited accessibility of functional human brain tissue. Here, we developed a new differentiation method of human induced pluripotent stem cells to generate three-dimensional brain organoids that contain oligodendrocytes as well as neurons and astrocytes, called human oligodendrocyte spheroids. We found that oligodendrocyte lineage cells derived in human oligodendrocyte spheroids transitioned through developmental stages similar to primary human oligodendrocytes and that the migration of oligodendrocyte lineage cells and their susceptibility to lysolecithin exposure could be captured by live imaging. Moreover, their morphology changed as they matured over time in vitro and started myelinating neurons. We anticipate that this method can be used to study oligodendrocyte development, myelination, and interactions with other major cell types in the CNS."

https://openalex.org/W2912304870,"There is mounting evidence that seemingly diverse psychiatric disorders share genetic etiology, but the biological substrates mediating this overlap are not well characterized. Here we leverage the unique Integrative Psychiatric Research Consortium (iPSYCH) study, a nationally representative cohort ascertained through clinical psychiatric diagnoses indicated in Danish national health registers. We confirm previous reports of individual and cross-disorder single-nucleotide polymorphism heritability for major psychiatric disorders and perform a cross-disorder genome-wide association study. We identify four novel genome-wide significant loci encompassing variants predicted to regulate genes expressed in radial glia and interneurons in the developing neocortex during mid-gestation. This epoch is supported by partitioning cross-disorder single-nucleotide polymorphism heritability, which is enriched at regulatory chromatin active during fetal neurodevelopment. These findings suggest that dysregulation of genes that direct neurodevelopment by common genetic variants may result in general liability for many later psychiatric outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W2914899943,"Loci discovered by genome-wide association studies predominantly map outside protein-coding genes. The interpretation of the functional consequences of non-coding variants can be greatly enhanced by catalogs of regulatory genomic regions in cell lines and primary tissues. However, robust and readily applicable methods are still lacking by which to systematically evaluate the contribution of these regions to genetic variation implicated in diseases or quantitative traits. Here we propose a novel approach that leverages genome-wide association studies' findings with regulatory or functional annotations to classify features relevant to a phenotype of interest. Within our framework, we account for major sources of confounding not offered by current methods. We further assess enrichment of genome-wide association studies for 19 traits within Encyclopedia of DNA Elements- and Roadmap-derived regulatory regions. We characterize unique enrichment patterns for traits and annotations driving novel biological insights. The method is implemented in standalone software and an R package, to facilitate its application by the research community."
https://openalex.org/W2911831757,"There is a challenge for metalloenzymes to acquire their correct metals because some inorganic elements form more stable complexes with proteins than do others. These preferences can be overcome provided some metals are more available than others. However, while the total amount of cellular metal can be readily measured, the available levels of each metal have been more difficult to define. Metal-sensing transcriptional regulators are tuned to the intracellular availabilities of their cognate ions. Here we have determined the standard free energy for metal complex formation to which each sensor, in a set of bacterial metal sensors, is attuned: the less competitive the metal, the less favorable the free energy and hence the greater availability to which the cognate allosteric mechanism is tuned. Comparing these free energies with values derived from the metal affinities of a metalloprotein reveals the mechanism of correct metalation exemplified here by a cobalt chelatase for vitamin B12."
https://openalex.org/W2914809873,"Chromatin is organized into topologically associating domains (TADs) enriched in distinct histone marks. In cancer, gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 protein (EZH2) lead to a genome-wide increase in histone-3 Lys27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) associated with transcriptional repression. However, the effects of these epigenetic changes on the structure and function of chromatin domains have not been explored. Here, we found a functional interplay between TADs and epigenetic and transcriptional changes mediated by mutated EZH2. Altered EZH2 (p.Tyr646* (EZH2Y646X)) led to silencing of entire domains, synergistically inactivating multiple tumor suppressors. Intra-TAD gene silencing was coupled with changes of interactions between gene promoter regions. Notably, gene expression and chromatin interactions were restored by pharmacological inhibition of EZH2Y646X. Our results indicate that EZH2Y646X alters the topology and function of chromatin domains to promote synergistic oncogenic programs. Oncogenic gain-of-function EZH2 mutations alter gene–promoter interactions and lead to silencing 1,034 of genes within topologically associating domains, thus resulting in inactivation of multiple tumor-suppressor genes."
https://openalex.org/W2911402973,"Less than 10% of the estimated average requirement (EAR) for iron and zinc is provided by consumption of storage roots of the staple crop cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) in West African human populations. We used genetic engineering to improve mineral micronutrient concentrations in cassava. Overexpression of the Arabidopsis thaliana vacuolar iron transporter VIT1 in cassava accumulated three- to seven-times-higher levels of iron in transgenic storage roots than nontransgenic controls in confined field trials in Puerto Rico. Plants engineered to coexpress a mutated A. thaliana iron transporter (IRT1) and A. thaliana ferritin (FER1) accumulated iron levels 7–18 times higher and zinc levels 3–10 times higher than those in nontransgenic controls in the field. Growth parameters and storage-root yields were unaffected by transgenic fortification in our field data. Measures of retention and bioaccessibility of iron and zinc in processed transgenic cassava indicated that IRT1 + FER1 plants could provide 40–50% of the EAR for iron and 60–70% of the EAR for zinc in 1- to 6-year-old children and nonlactating, nonpregnant West African women. Cassava, a staple crop consumed by 800 million people, is enriched in iron and zinc through genetic biofortification."

https://openalex.org/W2912439398,"In higher sensory cortices, there is a gradual transformation from sensation to perception and action. In the auditory system, this transformation is revealed by responses in the rostral ventral posterior auditory field (VPr), a tertiary area in the ferret auditory cortex, which shows long-term learning in trained compared to naïve animals, arising from selectively enhanced responses to behaviorally relevant target stimuli. This enhanced representation is further amplified during active performance of spectral or temporal auditory discrimination tasks. VPr also shows sustained short-term memory activity after target stimulus offset, correlated with task response timing and action. These task-related changes in auditory filter properties enable VPr neurons to quickly and nimbly switch between different responses to the same acoustic stimuli, reflecting either spectrotemporal properties, timing, or behavioral meaning of the sound. Furthermore, they demonstrate an interaction between the dynamics of short-term attention and long-term learning, as incoming sound is selectively attended, recognized, and translated into action."
https://openalex.org/W2914014134,"Palbociclib is a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) approved for the treatment of some cancers. The main mechanism of action of palbociclib is to induce cell cycle arrest and senescence on responsive cells. Here, we report that palbociclib concentrates in intracellular acidic vesicles, where it can be readily observed due to its intrinsic fluorescence, and it is released from these vesicles upon dilution or washing out of the extracellular medium. This reversible storage of drugs into acidic vesicles is generally known as lysosomal trapping and, based on this, we uncover novel properties of palbociclib. In particular, a short exposure of cells to palbociclib is sufficient to produce a stable cell-cycle arrest and long-term senescence. Moreover, after washing out the drug, palbociclib-treated cells release the drug to the medium and this conditioned medium is active on susceptible cells. Interestingly, cancer cells resistant to palbociclib also accumulate and release the drug producing paracrine senescence on susceptible cells. Finally, other lysosomotropic drugs, such as chloroquine, interfere with the accumulation of palbociclib into lysosomes, thereby reducing the minimal dose of palbociclib required for cell-cycle arrest and senescence. In summary, lysosomal trapping explains the prolonged temporal activity of palbociclib, the paracrine activity of exposed cells, and the cooperation with lysosomotropic drugs. These are important features that may help to improve the therapeutic dosing and efficacy of palbociclib. Finally, two other clinically approved CDK4/6 inhibitors, ribociclib and abemaciclib, present a similar behavior as palbociclib, suggesting that lysosomal trapping is a property common to all three clinically-approved CDK4/6 inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W2949176324,"In many developing countries there is paucity of evidence regarding the epidemiology of road traffic accidents (RTAs). The study determines the rates of injuries and fatalities associated with RTAs in Ethiopia based on the data of a recent national survey.The study is based on the secondary data of the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey conducted in 2016. The survey collected information about occurrence injuries and accidents including RTAs in the past 12 months among 75,271 members of 16,650 households. Households were selected from nine regions and two city administrations of Ethiopia using stratified cluster sampling procedure.Of the 75,271 household members enumerated, 123 encountered RTAs in the reference period and rate of RTA-related injury was 163 (95% confidence interval (CI): 136-195) per 100,000 population. Of the 123 causalities, 28 were fatal, making the fatality rate 37 (95% CI: 25-54) per 100,000 population. The RTA-related injuries and fatalities per 100,000 motor vehicles were estimated as 21,681 (95% CI: 18,090-25,938) and 4,922 (95% CI: 3325-7183), respectively. Next to accidental falls, RTAs were the second most common form of accidents and injuries accounting for 22.8% of all such incidents. RTAs contributed to 43.8% of all fatalities secondary to accidents and injuries. Among RTA causalities, 21.9% were drivers, 35.0% were passenger vehicle occupants and 36.0% were vulnerable road users including: motorcyclists (21.0%), pedestrians (12.1%) and cyclists (2.9%). Approximately half (47.1%) of the causalities were between 15-29 years of age and 15.3% were either minors younger than 15 years or seniors older than 64 years of age. Nearly two-thirds (65.0%) of the victims were males.RTA-related causalities are extremely high in Ethiopia. Male young adults and vulnerable road users are at increased risk of RTAs. There is a urgent need for bringing road safety to the country's public health agenda."

https://openalex.org/W2981650680,"Cartilage engineering strategies using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could provide preferable solutions to resolve long-segment tracheal defects. However, the drawbacks of widely used chondrogenic protocols containing TGF-β3, such as inefficiency and unstable cellular phenotype, are problematic. In our research, to optimize the chondrogenic differentiation of human umbilical cord MSCs (hUCMSCs), kartogenin (KGN) preconditioning was performed prior to TGF-β3 induction. hUCMSCs were preconditioned with 1 µM of KGN for 3 d, sequentially pelleted, and incubated with TGF-β3 for 28 d. Then, the expression of chondrogenesis- and ossification-related genes was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. The underlying mechanism governing the beneficial effects of KGN preconditioning was explored by phosphorylated kinase screening and validated in vitro and in vivo using JNK inhibitor (SP600125) and β-catenin activator (SKL2001). After KGN preconditioning, expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3, a marker of precartilaginous stem cells, was up-regulated in hUCMSCs. Furthermore, the KGN-preconditioned hUCMSCs efficiently differentiated into chondrocytes with elevated chondrogenic gene (SOX9, aggrecan, and collagen II) expression and reduced expression of ossifie genes (collagen X and MMP13) compared with hUCMSCs treated with TGF-β3 only. Phosphokinase screening indicated that the beneficial effects of KGN preconditioning are directly related to an up-regulation of JNK phosphorylation and a suppression of β-catenin levels. Blocking and activating tests revealed that the prochondrogenic effects of KGN preconditioning was achieved mainly by activating the JNK/Runt-related transcription factor (RUNX)1 pathway, and antiossific effects were imparted by suppressing the β-catenin/RUNX2 pathway. Eventually, tracheal patches, based on KGN-preconditioned hUCMSCs and TGF-β3 encapsulated electrospun poly (l-lactic acid-co-ε-caprolactone)/collagen nanofilms, were successfully used for restoring tracheal defects in rabbit models. In summary, KGN preconditioning likely improves the chondrogenic differentiation of hUCMSCs by committing them to a precartilaginous stage with enhanced JNK phosphorylation and suppressed β-catenin. This novel protocol consisting of KGN preconditioning and subsequent TGF-β3 induction might be preferable for cartilage engineering strategies using MSCs.—Jing, H., Zhang, X., Gao, M., Luo, K., Fu, W., Yin, M., Wang, W., Zhu, Z., Zheng, J., He, X.

https://openalex.org/W2910732406,"Functionally and anatomically distinct cortical substructures, such as areas or layers, contain different principal neuron (PN) subtypes that generate output signals representing particular information. Various types of cortical inhibitory interneurons (INs) differentially but coordinately regulate PN activity. Despite a potential determinant for functional specialization of PN subtypes, the spatial organization of IN subtypes that innervate defined PN subtypes remains unknown. Here we develop a genetic strategy combining a recombinase-based intersectional labeling method and rabies viral monosynaptic tracing, which enables subtype-specific visualization of cortical IN ensembles sending inputs to defined PN subtypes. Our approach reveals not only cardinal but also underrepresented connections between broad, non-overlapping IN subtypes and PNs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that distinct PN subtypes defined by areal or laminar positions display different organization of input IN subtypes. Our genetic strategy will facilitate understanding of the wiring and developmental principles of cortical inhibitory circuits at unparalleled levels."

Although ibrutinib is not curative, it has a profound effect on CLL cells and may create new pharmacologically exploitable vulnerabilities. To identify such vulnerabilities, we developed a systematic approach that combines epigenome profiling (charting the gene-regulatory basis of cell state) with single-cell chemosensitivity profiling (quantifying cell-type-specific drug response) and bioinformatic data integration. By applying our method to a cohort of matched patient samples collected before and during ibrutinib therapy, we identified characteristic ibrutinib-induced changes that provide a starting point for the rational design of ibrutinib combination therapies. Specifically, we observed and validated preferential sensitivity to proteasome, PLK1, and mTOR inhibitors during ibrutinib treatment. More generally, our study establishes a broadly applicable method for investigating treatment-specific vulnerabilities by integrating the complementary perspectives of epigenetic cell states and phenotypic drug responses in primary patient samples."

In this study, we analyse the association of myopia and education in the U.S. and investigate its age-dependency.We conducted a secondary data analysis using the public use files from the cross-sectional study National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of the period from 1999 to 2008. 19,756 participants aged 20 to 85 years were included with data on education and ophthalmic parameters (distance visual acuity, objective refraction and keratometry). Spherical equivalent, astigmatism, corneal power and corneal astigmatism were evaluated for an association with education using linear regression analysis with adjustment of potential confounders.Analysis revealed an association between spherical equivalent and educational level in the univariate analysis (P < .001), and in the adjusted model (P < .001). Subjects who attend school to less than 9th grade had a mean spherical equivalent of 0.34 D, subjects with 9-11th grade -0.14 D, subjects that finished high school -0.33 D, subjects with partial college education -0.70 D, subjects that graduated from college or a higher formal education -1.22 D. Subjects that graduated from college or above were -1.47 D more myopic compared to subjects that completed less than 9th grade school in the adjusted analyses. Astigmatism and corneal curvature was not associated with education.Myopia is associated with higher education in the U.S. Our analysis shows that corneal curvature does not contribute to this association, therefore axial elongation or lens power are likely to contribute to myopia."

Human white blood cells and five types of cancer cell lines were imaged by quantitative phase microscopy, which provides morphological information without staining quantitatively in terms of optical thickness of cells. Subcellular features were then extracted from the obtained images as training data sets for the machine learning. The built classifier successfully classified WBCs from cell lines (area under ROC curve = 0.996). This label-free, non-cytotoxic cell classification based on the subcellular structure of QPM images has the potential to serve as an automated diagnosis of single cells."
https://openalex.org/W2911258820,"Background The Opuntia spp. have been used in traditional medicine for many centuries. It is used in the management of diseases that involves oxidative stress, especially diabetes, obesity and cancer. Opuntia stricta (Haw) is one of the relatively unknown species in South Africa where it is regarded more as a weed. Because of this, not much is known about its chemical composition. Aim To determine the chemical composition, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cytotoxic activities of Opuntia stricta cladodes. Methods The phytochemical composition of acetone, aqueous and ethanol extract of cladodes of Opuntia stricta (Haw), as well as the vitamins A, C and E of its dried weight cladodes and the antioxidant activities, were evaluated using standard in vitro methods. The anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activities were evaluated using cell-based assays. The phytochemical composition and vitamins were determined spectrophotometrically, while the antioxidant activities were determined by DPPH, nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity and phosphomolybdenum (total) antioxidant activity. Anti-inflammatory activity was determined using RAW 264.7 cells, while cytotoxicity was determined using U937 cells. Results The phytochemical composition showed a significant difference in the various extracts. The total phenolics were higher than other phytochemicals in all the extracts used. All the extracts displayed antioxidant activity, while most of the extracts showed anti-inflammatory activity. Only one extract showed cytotoxicity, and it was mild. Conclusion The results show that the Opuntia stricta is rich in polyphenolic compounds and has good antioxidant activity as well as anti-inflammatory activities."
https://openalex.org/W2913044550,"Background Malaria continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) is one of the cost-effective interventions for preventing malaria in endemic settings. Ghana has made tremendous efforts to ensure widespread ownership and use of ITNs. However, national coverage statistics can mask important inequities that demand targeted attention. This study assesses the disparities in ownership and utilization of ITNs among reproductive-aged women in a rural impoverished setting of Ghana. Methods Population-based cross-sectional data of 3,993 women between the age of 15 and 49 years were collected in seven districts of the Upper East region of Ghana using a two-stage cluster sampling approach. Bivariate and multivariate regression models were used to assess the social, economic and demographic disparities in ownership and utilization of ITN and to compare utilization rates among women in households owning at least one ITN. Results As high as 79% of respondents were found to own ITN while 62% of ITN owners used them the night preceding the survey. We identified disparities in both ownership and utilization of ITNs in wealth index, occupational status, religion, and district of residence. Respondents in the relative richest wealth quintile were 74% more likely to own ITNs compared to those in the poorest quintile (p-value< 0.001, CI = 1.29–2.34) however, they were 33% less likely to use ITNs compared to the poorest (p-value = 0.01, CI = 0.50–0.91). Conclusion Interventions aimed at preventing and controlling malaria through the use of bed nets in rural Ghana and other similar settings should give more attention to disadvantage populations such as the poor and unemployed. Tailored massages and educational campaigns are required to ensure consistent use of treated bed nets."
https://openalex.org/W2911609596,"Anthocyanin pigments play many roles in plants, including providing protection against biotic and abiotic stresses. To identify new regulatory genes in apple (Malus domestica) that may be involved in regulating low temperature induced anthocyanin biosynthesis, we performed RNA-seq analysis of leaves from the ‘Gala’ apple cultivar following exposure to a low temperature (16 °C). A visible red color appeared on the upper leaves and the anthocyanin content increased significantly after the low temperature treatment. Genes from the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway were significantly enriched among the differentially expressed genes, and the expression of several transcription factors was shown by WGCNA (weighted gene co-expression network analysis) to correlate with anthocyanin accumulation, including members of the MYB, MADS, WRKY, WD40, Zinc Finger and HB-ZIP families. Three MYB transcription factors (MdMYB12, MdMYB22 and MdMYB114), which had several CBF/DREB response elements in their promoters, were significantly induced by low temperature exposure and their expression also correlated highly with anthocyanin accumulation. We hypothesize that they may act as regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis and be regulated by CBF/DREB transcription factors in apple leaves under low temperature conditions. The analyses presented here provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying anthocyanin accumulation during low temperature exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2914887598,"Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-associated gastric carcinoma (EBVaGC), one of four major gastric cancer types, consists of clonal growth of EBV-infected epithelial cells. However, the significance of viral loads in each tumor cell has not been evaluated. EBV-DNA is stably maintained in episomal form in the nucleus of each cancer cell. To estimate EBV copy number per genome (EBV-CN), qPCR of viral EBNA1 and host GAPDH, standardized by Namalwa DNA (one copy/genome), was applied to the formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) surgically resected EBVaGC specimens (n = 43) and EBVaGC cell lines (SNU-719 and NCC-24). In surgical specimens, the cancer cell ratio (CCR) was determined with image analysis, and EBV-CN was obtained by adjusting qPCR value with CCR. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was also applied to the FFPE sections using the whole EBV-genome as a probe. In surgical specimens, EBV-CN obtained by qPCR/CCR was between 1.2 and 185 copies with a median of 9.9. EBV-CN of SNU-719 and NCC-24 was 42.0 and 1.1, respectively. A linear correlation was observed with qPCR/CCR data up to 20 copies/genome (40 signals/nucleus), the limit of FISH analysis. In addition, substantial variation in the number of EBV foci was observed. Based on qPCR/CCR, high EBV-CN (>10 copies) correlated with PD-L1 expression in cancer cells (P = 0.015), but not with other pathological indicators. Furthermore, EBVaGC with high EBV-CN showed worse disease-specific survival (P = 0.041). Our findings suggest that cancer cell viral loads may contribute to expression of the immune checkpoint molecule and promotion of cancer progression in EBVaGC."
https://openalex.org/W2913528275,"Astrocytes mediate the destruction of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) during ischemic stroke (IS). IL-9 is a pleiotropic cytokine that we previously found to be highly expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with IS, and the presence of IL-9 receptors on astrocytes has been reported in the literature. Here, we detected the effect of IL-9 on astrocytes using an anti–IL-9-neutralizing antibody to treat rats with experimental stroke. Supernatants from astrocytes treated with or without oxygen–glucose deprivation and/or IL-9 were incubated with bEnd.3 cell monolayers after blocking the IL-9 receptor on the endothelium. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analyses were conducted to observe the change in tight junction proteins (TJPs) in bEnd.3 cells as well as the level of VEGF-A and possible signal pathways in astrocytes. We also applied middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) models to determine the effect of anti–IL-9-neutralizing antibodies on IS. As a result, astrocyte-conditioned medium treated with IL-9 aggravated the disruption of the BBB accomplished by the degradation of TJPs in endothelial cells. In addition, IL-9 increased the level of VEGF-A in astrocytes, and blocking the effect of VEGF-A reversed the breakdown of the BBB. In the MCAO model, anti–IL-9-neutralizing antibody reduced the infarct volume and BBB destruction. Mechanistically, the anti–IL-9-neutralizing antibody repaired the damaged TJPs (zonula occludens 1, occludin, and claudin-5) and induced a decrease in VEGF-A expression in ischemic lateral brain tissue. In contrast, a local injection of recombinant murine IL-9 to the brain resulted in a marked up-regulation of VEGF-A in the striatum. In conclusion, anti–IL-9-neutralizing antibody can reduce the severity of IS partially by alleviating the destruction of the BBB via down-regulation of astrocyte-derived VEGF-A. This finding suggests that targeting IL-9 or VEGF-A could provide a new direction for the treatment of IS.—Tan, S., Shan, Y., Lin, Y., Liao, S., Zhang, B., Zeng, Q., Wang, Y., Deng, Z., Chen, C, Hu, X., Peng, L., Qiu, W., Lu, Z.

https://openalex.org/W2913559498,"Drug combinations are extensively used to treat cancer and are often selected according to complementary mechanisms. Here, we describe a cell-based high-throughput screening assay for identification of synergistic combinations between broadly applied platinum-based chemotherapeutics and drugs from a library composed of 1280 chemically and pharmacologically diverse (mostly FDA approved) compounds. The assay was performed on chemoresistant cell lines derived from lung (A549) and pancreatic (PANC-1) carcinoma, where platinum-based combination regimens are currently applied though with limited success. The synergistic combinations identified during the screening were validated by synergy quantification using the combination index method and via high content fluorescent microscopy analysis. New promising synergistic combinations discovered using this approach include compounds currently not used as anticancer drugs, such as cisplatin or carboplatin with hycanthone and cisplatin with spironolactone in pancreatic carcinoma, and carboplatin and deferoxamine in non-small cell lung cancer. Strong synergy between cisplatin or carboplatin and topotecan in PANC-1 cells, compared to A549 cells, suggests that this combination, currently used in lung cancer treatment regimens, could be applied to pancreatic carcinoma as well. Several drugs used to treat diseases other than cancer, including pyrvinium pamoate, auranofin, terfenadine and haloprogin, showed strong cytotoxicity on their own and synergistic interactions with platinum drugs. This study demonstrates that non-obvious drug combinations that would not be selected based on complementary mechanisms can be identified via high-throughput screening."

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing and microarray data, in silico analyses were conducted to identify and characterize unique and overlapping GLI1 and GLI2 binding regions in neoplastic chondrocytes. After overlaying microarray data from human chondrosarcoma, 204 upregulated and 106 downregulated genes were identified as Hh-responsive Gli binding targets. After overlaying published Gli ChIP-on-chip data from mouse, 48 genes were identified as potential direct downstream targets of Hedgehog signaling with shared GLI binding regions in evolutionarily conserved DNA elements. Among these was BMP2, pointing to potential cross-talk between TGF beta signaling and Hh signaling. Our identification of potential target genes that are unique and common to GLI1 and GLI2 in neoplastic chondrocytes contributes to elucidating potential pathways through which Hh signaling impacts cartilage tumor biology."

Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze protein expression in adenomyotic endometrium tissue specimens.Of the tested mediators, transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) and its isoforms were effective to induce collagen and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression. Collagen and CTGF induction by TGFβ1 could be reduced by the inhibitors targeting DNA transcription, protein translation, and Smad2/3 signaling. Interestingly, TGFβ1 induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation and CTGF mRNA expression, but not collagen mRNA expression, suggesting that TGFβ1 mediates collagen expression through CTGF induction and Smad2/3 activation. In parallel, TGFβ1 and CTGF also induced expression of heat shock protein (HSP) 47, a protein required for the synthesis of several types of collagens. However, only CTGF siRNA knockdown, could compromise TGFβ1-induced collagen expression. Finally, the immunohistochemistry revealed vimentin- and α-SMA-positive staining for (myo)fibroblasts, TGFβ1, collagen, and CTGF in the subepithelial stroma region of human adenomyotic endometria.We reveal here that TGFβ1, collagen, and CTGF are expressed in the stroma of adenomyotic endometria and demonstrate that TGFβ1 can induce collagen production in endometrium-derived fibroblasts through cellular Smad2/3-dependent signaling pathway and CTGF expression, suggesting that endometrial TGFβ may take part in the pathogenesis of adenomyosis and ectopic endometrium may participate in uterine adenomyosis."
https://openalex.org/W2911853739,"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a worldwide health problem and hepatocyte apoptosis has been associated with the development/progression of ALD. However, no definite effective pharmacotherapy for ALD is currently available. Cilostazol, a selective type III phosphodiesterase inhibitor has been shown to protect hepatocytes from ethanol-induced apoptosis. In the present study, the underlying mechanisms for the protective effects of cilostazol were examined. Primary rat hepatocytes were treated with ethanol in the presence or absence of cilostazol. Cell viability and intracellular cAMP were measured. Apoptosis was detected by Hoechst staining, TUNEL assay, and caspase-3 activity assay. The roles of cAMP and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways in the action of CTZ were explored using pharmacological inhibitors and siRNAs. Liver from mice received ethanol (5 g/kg body weight) by oral gavage following cilostazol treatment intraperitoneally was obtained for measurement of apoptosis and activation of AMPK pathway. Cilostazol inhibited ethanol-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and potentiated the increases in cAMP level induced by forskolin. However, the anti-apoptotic effect of cilostazol was not reversed by an inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase. Interestingly, cilostazol activated AMPK and increased the level of LC3-II, a marker of autophagy. The inhibition of AMPK abolished the effects of cilostazol on LC3-II expression and apoptosis. Moreover, the inhibition of LKB1 and CaMKK2, upstream kinases of AMPK, dampened cilostazol-inhibited apoptosis as well as AMPK activation. In conclusion, cilostazol protected hepatocytes from apoptosis induced by ethanol mainly via AMPK pathway which is regulated by both LKB1 and CaMKK2. Our results suggest that cilostazol may have potential as a promising therapeutic drug for treatment of ALD."

The optical coherence tomography (OCT) is increasingly utilized to noninvasively evaluate various types of retinal diseases, including RP. The present study was conducted to characterize the OCT findings of the RPE65-/- mice-an animal model of LCA and RP-in relation to the morphological features based on histological and electron microscopic findings as well as electroretinography (ERG) features.RPE65-/- mice were employed as a model of retinal degeneration. C57BL/6J mice were used as a wild-type control. OCT was performed on the RPE65-/- mice from postnatal day (P) 22 to 170. The longitudinal changes in the OCT images and fundus pictures were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively in comparison to those of C57BL/6J mice. The OCT images were also compared to the histological and electron microscopic findings. Full field combined rod and cone ERG was performed to analyze the relationship between morphology based on OCT and the amplitudes of the a- and b-waves.In the RPE65-/- mice, the photoreceptor rod and cone layer appeared as a diffuse hyperreflective zone contiguous with the inner segment ellipsoid zone (IS-EZ) on OCT, even on P22, whereas the IS-EZ and interdigitation zone were clearly identified in the age-matched C57BL/6J mice. The histological analyses revealed that the regular arrangement of the photoreceptor inner and outer segments was gradually lost in the RPE65-/- mice. On electron microscopy, most of the rod outer segments were degenerated from P21 to P35, whereas outer segments became variably shorter after P49 although ultrastructure appeared to normalize. The thickness of the outer nuclear layer of RPE65-/- mice was slowly and progressively reduced in comparison to C57BL/6J mice. Although the thickness of the inner and outer segment layer of RPE65-/- mice was significantly decreased in comparison to C57BL/6J mice, the change was not progressive, at least until P170. Even at P35, the amplitudes of both a- and b-waves on ERG were severely deteriorated in comparison to those of C57BL/6J mice. Mottled depigmented spots appeared throughout the fundus in RPE65-/- mice after P72, and were detected as hyperreflective deposits under the retinal pigment epithelium on OCT.The pathological changes in the inner and outer segments layer of RPE65-/- mice were identified as diffuse hyperreflective changes on OCT. The rod outer segments showed degeneration in the early postnatal periods but became morphologically normalized in the disc structure after P49, although the sizes of the length of the rod outer segments were variable. OCT could not qualitatively differentiate the early degeneration of rods from the late variability in size of rods. Although the morphology of the photoreceptor outer segments was relatively preserved in the RPE65-/- mice, the amplitudes of ERG were severely disturbed. These structural and functional deficits may be derived from the defective supply of 11-cis-retinol to the photoreceptors."
https://openalex.org/W2952001745,"Despite the conserved function of aggression across taxa in obtaining critical resources such as food and mates, serotonin's (5-HT) modulatory role on aggressive behavior appears to be largely inhibitory for vertebrates but stimulatory for invertebrates. However, critical gaps exist in our knowledge of invertebrates that need to be addressed before definitively stating opposing roles for 5-HT and aggression. Specifically, the role of 5-HT receptor subtypes are largely unknown, as is the potential interactive role of 5-HT with other neurochemical systems known to play a critical role in aggression. Similarly, the influence of these systems in driving sex differences in aggressive behavior of invertebrates is not well understood. Here, we investigated these questions by employing complementary approaches in a novel invertebrate model of aggression, the stalk-eyed fly. A combination of altered social conditions, pharmacological manipulation and 5-HT2 receptor knockdown by siRNA revealed an inhibitory role of this receptor subtype on aggression. Additionally, we provide evidence for 5-HT2's involvement in regulating neuropeptide F activity, a suspected inhibitor of aggression. However, this function appears to be stage-specific, altering only the initiation stage of aggressive conflicts. Alternatively, pharmacologically increasing systemic concentrations of 5-HT significantly elevated the expression of the neuropeptide tachykinin, which did not affect contest initiation but instead promoted escalation via production of high intensity aggressive behaviors. Notably, these effects were limited solely to males, with female aggression and neuropeptide expression remaining unaltered by any manipulation that affected 5-HT. Together, these results demonstrate a more nuanced role for 5-HT in modulating aggression in invertebrates, revealing an important interactive role with neuropeptides that is more reminiscent of vertebrates. The sex-differences described here also provide valuable insight into the evolutionary contexts of this complex behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2913173009,"Capsaicin is a natural compound present in chili and red peppers and the responsible of their spicy flavor. It has recently provoked interest because of its antitumoral effects in many cell types although its action mechanism is not clearly understood. As metabolic dysregulation is one of the hallmarks of cancer cells and the key metabolic sensor in the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), in this study we explored the ability of capsaicin to modulate AMPK activity. We found that capsaicin activated AMPK in HepG2 cells by increasing AMPK phosphorylation and its downstream target ACC. Mechanistically, we determined that capsaicin activated AMPK through the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β, CaMKKβ as either the CaMKK inhibitor STO-609 or CaMKK knock down with siRNA abrogated the activation of AMPK. Moreover, capsaicin decreased cell viability, inhibited Akt/mTOR pathway and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HepG2 cells. AMPK activation was involved in the underpinning mechanism of capsaicin-induced cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2912299335,"Association mapping of factors that condition pyrethroid resistance in Aedes aegypti has consistently identified genes in multiple functional groups. Toward better understanding of the mechanisms involved, we examined high throughput sequencing data (HTS) from two Aedes aegypti aegypti collections from Merida, Yucatan, Mexico treated with either permethrin or deltamethrin. Exome capture enrichment for coding regions and the AaegL5 annotation were used to identify genes statistically associated with resistance. The frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were compared between resistant and susceptible mosquito pools using a contingency χ2 analysis. The -log10(χ2 p value) was calculated at each SNP site, with a weighted average determined from all sites in each gene. Genes with -log10(χ2 p value) ≥ 4.0 and present among all 3 treatment groups were subjected to gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). We found that several functional groups were enriched compared to all coding genes. These categories were transport, signal transduction and metabolism, in order from highest to lowest statistical significance. Strikingly, 21 genes with demonstrated association to synaptic function were identified. In the high association group (n = 1,053 genes), several genes were identified that also genetically or physically interact with the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC). These genes were eg., CHARLATAN (CHL), a transcriptional regulator, several ankyrin-domain proteins, PUMILIO (PUM), a translational repressor, and NEDD4 (E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase). There were 13 genes that ranked among the top 10%: these included VGSC; CINGULIN, a predicted neuronal gap junction protein, and the aedine ortholog of NERVY (NVY), a transcriptional regulator. Silencing of CHL and NVY followed by standard permethrin bottle bioassays validated their association with permethrin resistance. Importantly, VGSC levels were also reduced about 50% in chl- or nvy-dsRNA treated mosquitoes. These results are consistent with the contribution of a variety of neuronal pathways to pyrethroid resistance in Ae. aegypti."
https://openalex.org/W2913438937,"Texture analysis is an important topic in Ultrasound (US) image analysis for structure segmentation and tissue classification. In this work a novel approach for US image texture feature extraction is presented. It is mainly based on parametrical modelling of a signal version of the US image in order to process it as data resulting from a dynamical process. Because of the predictive characteristics of such a model representation, good estimations of texture features can be obtained with less data than generally used methods require, allowing higher robustness to low Signal-to-Noise ratio and a more localized US image analysis. The usability of the proposed approach was demonstrated by extracting texture features for segmenting the thyroid in US images. The obtained results showed that features corresponding to energy ratios between different modelled texture frequency bands allowed to clearly distinguish between thyroid and non-thyroid texture. A simple k-means clustering algorithm has been used for separating US image patches as belonging to thyroid or not. Segmentation of thyroid was performed in two different datasets obtaining Dice coefficients over 85%."
https://openalex.org/W2914827183,"Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) play a pivotal role in hepatic function and homeostasis. LSEC dysfunction has been recognized to be closely involved in various liver diseases, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but not much is known about the fate of the scavenger receptors in LSECs during NASH. Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcγRIIb), known as a scavenger receptor, contributes to receptor-mediated endocytosis and immune complexes clearance. In this study, to elucidate the fate of FcγRIIb in the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), we examined FcγRIIb levels in NAFLD biopsy specimens by immunohistochemistry, and investigated their correlation with the exacerbation of biological indexes and clinicopathological scores of NASH. The FcγRIIb expression levels indicated significant negative correlations with serum levels of blood lipids (triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol), type 4 collagen and hyaluronic acid, which are involved in hepatic lipid metabolism disorder, fibrosis, and inflammation, respectively. However, there was no significant difference of FcγRIIb expression levels among the pathological grades of NAFLD. During NAFLD progression, inflammation and fibrosis may influence the expression of FcγRIIb and their scavenger functions to maintain hepatic homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2914423661,"Informed consent is an essential part of an ethical clinical trial; to this end, researchers have developed several interventions to promote participants' full understanding of trials and thereby improve the consent process. However, few empirical studies have examined how patients make the decision of whether to give consent. The objective of this study, therefore, is to analyze patients' decision-making process when participating in clinical trials. We conduct an internet survey (n = 2,045) and interview data analysis (n = 40) with patients and categorize respondents into three types of participants: active, passive, and non-participation. Our results show that patients often make informal and quick decisions before medical staff provide them with relevant information during the informed consent process. For example, 55.9% of patients received initial information on clinical trials from an online article or web advertising, and 54.5% consulted no one about whether to participate in the clinical trial before making a decision. Only 20.7% of respondents subjectively spent time making the decision whether to participate; 43.0% of patients who said that they ""spent time"" coming to a decision took four or more days to reach a decision, while 8.3% of people who ""did not spend time"" making a decision took this among of time. Based on these results, we were able to break patients' decision-making process into four steps: first contact, informal decision making, relevant information, and formal decision making. Our results show that patients are most likely to make a decision based on the first information they receive on the clinical trial, whatever the source. To this end, having a list of questions for potential participants to ask researchers would be useful in helping better collecting information of clinical trials. In addition, research teams should give patients more than four days to decide between providing them with relevant information and obtaining written consent, even if the patient seems to make a quick decision."
https://openalex.org/W2914110734,"In the South China Sea (SCS), Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis (S. oualaniensis) generally has the highest stock density in spring and occupies an important position in fisheries. The responses of S. oualaniensis to marine environments in the north-central SCS in spring (March to May) from 2006 to 2010 were analyzed using satellite and in situ observations, with generalized additive models (GAMs). A high proportion variation in catch per unit effort (CPUE) was explained by environmental variables, including sea surface temperature (SST; explaining 13.8%) and the interaction between SST and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration (explaining 16.9%). SSTs within the range of 24–28°C and Chl-a concentrations within 0.10–0.35 mg/m3 had positive effects on S. oualaniensis CPUE, and SST within 28–29.5°Cand Chl-a concentrations within 0.05–0.20 mg/m3 had negative effects. In addition, the response time of the maximum standardized catch per unit effort (SCPUE) in May to the maximum Chl-a in March was approximately six ten-day time step. The higher Chl-a and smaller stock size of S. oualaniensis in early March 2008 were partly associated with climatic anomalies caused by La Niña in spring and the limitation of S. oualaniensisby low temperature in 2008. The findings in this study can help better protect and manage S. oualaniensis resources in the SCS."
https://openalex.org/W2913161807,"Background Olanzapine (OLZ) is a second-generation antipsychotic drug used for treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other neuropsychiatric conditions. Undesirable side effects of OLZ include metabolic alterations associated with chronic oxidative-inflammation events. It is possible that lithium (Li), a mood modulator that exhibits anti-inflammatory properties may attenuate OLZ-induced oxi-inflammatory effects. Methodology To test this hypothesis we activated RAW 264.7 immortalized macrophages with OLZ and evaluated oxidation and inflammation at the gene and protein levels. Li and OLZ concentrations were determined using estimated plasma therapeutic concentrations. Results OLZ triggered a significant increase in macrophage proliferation at 72 h. Higher levels of oxidative markers and proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, with a concomitant reduction in IL-10, were observed in OLZ-exposed macrophages. Lithium (Li) exposure triggered a short and attenuated inflammatory response demonstrated by elevation of superoxide anion (SA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), IL-1β, and cellular proliferation followed by elevation of anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels. Li treatment of OLZ-supplemented macrophages was able to reverse elevation of oxidative and inflammatory markers and increase IL-10 levels. Conclusions Despite methodological limitations related to in vitro protocols, results suggested that Li may attenuate OLZ-induced oxidative and inflammatory responses that result from metabolic side effects associated with OLZ."

Graph theory analysis was used to quantify the role of each node using a set of metrics: degree, global efficiency, clustering and modularity. To summarize the abnormal connectivity profile of brain regions in patients compared to healthy subjects, we defined a hub disruption index κ.Concerning the global organization of networks in NMOSD, a small-world topology was preserved without significant modification concerning all average metrics. However, visual networks and the sensorimotor network showed decreased connectivity with high interindividual variability. The hub disruption index κ was correlated to the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).These results demonstrate a correlation between disability according to the EDSS and neuronal reorganization using the rs-fMRI graph methodology. The conservation of a normal global topological structure despite local modifications in functional connectivity seems to show brain plasticity in response to the disability."
https://openalex.org/W2963464356,"The formation and stability of social hierarchies is a question of general relevance. Here, we propose a simple generalized theoretical model for establishing social hierarchy via pair-wise interactions between individuals and investigate its stability. In each interaction or fight, the probability of ""winning"" depends solely on the relative societal status of the participants, and the winner has a gain of status whereas there is an equal loss to the loser. The interactions are characterized by two parameters. The first parameter represents how much can be lost, and the second parameter represents the degree to which even a small difference of status can guarantee a win for the higher-status individual. Depending on the parameters, the resulting status distributions reach either a continuous unimodal form or lead to a totalitarian end state with one high-status individual and all other individuals having status approaching zero. However, we find that in the latter case long-lived intermediary distributions often exist, which can give the illusion of a stable society. As we show, our model allows us to make predictions consistent with animal interaction data and their evolution over a number of years. Moreover, by implementing a simple, but realistic rule that restricts interactions to sufficiently similar-status individuals, the stable or long-lived distributions acquire high-status structure corresponding to a distinct high-status class. Using household income as a proxy for societal status in human societies, we find agreement over their entire range from the low-to-middle-status parts to the characteristic high-status ""tail"". We discuss how the model provides a conceptual framework for understanding the origin of social hierarchy and the factors which lead to the preservation or deterioration of the societal structure."
https://openalex.org/W2898942800,"Through forward genetic screening for mutations affecting visual system development, we identified prominent coloboma and cell-autonomous retinal neuron differentiation, lamination and retinal axon projection defects in eisspalte (ele) mutant zebrafish. Additional axonal deficits were present, most notably at midline axon commissures. Genetic mapping and cloning of the ele mutation showed that the affected gene is slbp, which encodes a conserved RNA stem-loop binding protein involved in replication dependent histone mRNA metabolism. Cells throughout the central nervous system remained in the cell cycle in ele mutant embryos at stages when, and locations where, post-mitotic cells have differentiated in wild-type siblings. Indeed, RNAseq analysis showed down-regulation of many genes associated with neuronal differentiation. This was coincident with changes in the levels and spatial localisation of expression of various genes implicated, for instance, in axon guidance, that likely underlie specific ele phenotypes. These results suggest that many of the cell and tissue specific phenotypes in ele mutant embryos are secondary to altered expression of modules of developmental regulatory genes that characterise, or promote transitions in, cell state and require the correct function of Slbp-dependent histone and chromatin regulatory genes."

However, some microorganisms are able to accumulate PHAs as poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [P(3HB)] during the first fermentation stage, the cell growth phase, without nutrient limitation, once they have been reported to utilize type II metabolism during the polymer accumulation phase. This study evaluated the effect of aeration and agitation on cell growth and P(3HB) accumulation in Ralstonia solanacearum RS, performed in a bioreactor for 24h at 32°C. A 22 central composite rotational design (CCRD) was used, with agitation (150 to 250 rpm) and aeration (0.3 to 1 vvm) as independent variables and optical density (OD600nm), dry cell weight (DCW), and P(3HB) yield as dependent variables. A significant polymer accumulation, until 70% of P(3HB), was observed, proving that R. solanacearum RS exhibited metabolism type II, regardless of the aeration process. The best results were obtained for 1 vvm and 250 rpm (+1, +1), with values of OD600nm (18.04) and DCW (4.82 g.L-1)."

This study compares variability in the reproductive and genetic traits of the hermaphroditic broadcast spawning coral Acropora hyacinthus, from the Western Pacific Region, across six different latitudes [Japan (33° and 31°N), Taiwan (23°, 22° and 21°N), and Indonesia (5°S)]. Egg sizes among corals in the lowest latitude studied were significantly larger than those at high latitudes, while the mean number of eggs were significantly different only among high latitude and two out of the three mid latitude locations studied. Egg numbers were significantly negatively correlated with egg and testis volumes, indicating reproductive trade-offs across locations. Female gonad volumes were smaller at high latitudes but significantly larger at lower latitudes, being positively correlated with seawater temperatures. Furthermore, high genetic similarities among populations suggest active gene flow among low-, mid- and high-latitude locations. An exception to this trend, the mid-latitude location of Penghu (off western Taiwan) formed an independent group with highly similar genetic and reproductive traits, suggesting reproductive isolation with local adaptations. This study reports natural spatial variations in the reproductive traits of A. hyacinthus at different latitudinal locations, which may serve as baseline information to predict how the life histories of corals in general respond to the impacts of climate change."

To identify regulatory elements, we conducted a new bioinformatics analysis of insertional mutagenesis screens interrogating WNT signaling in haploid human cells. We searched for specific patterns of retroviral gene trap integrations (used as mutagens in haploid screens) in short genomic intervals overlapping with introns and regions upstream of genes. We uncovered atypical patterns of gene trap insertions that were not predicted to disrupt coding sequences, but caused changes in the expression of two key regulators of WNT signaling, suggesting the presence of cis-regulatory elements. Our methodology extends the scope of haploid genetic screens by enabling the identification of regulatory elements that control gene expression."
