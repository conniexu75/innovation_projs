Using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Nam et al.

https://openalex.org/W2113486346,"How adult tissue stem and niche cells respond to the nutritional state of an organism is not well understood. Here we find that Paneth cells, a key constituent of the mammalian intestinal stem-cell (ISC) niche, augment stem-cell function in response to calorie restriction. Calorie restriction acts by reducing mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling in Paneth cells, and the ISC-enhancing effects of calorie restriction can be mimicked by rapamycin. Calorie intake regulates mTORC1 in Paneth cells, but not ISCs, and forced activation of mTORC1 in Paneth cells during calorie restriction abolishes the ISC-augmenting effects of the niche. Finally, increased expression of bone stromal antigen 1 (Bst1) in Paneth cells—an ectoenzyme that produces the paracrine factor cyclic ADP ribose—mediates the effects of calorie restriction and rapamycin on ISC function. Our findings establish that mTORC1 non-cell-autonomously regulates stem-cell self-renewal, and highlight a significant role of the mammalian intestinal niche in coupling stem-cell function to organismal physiology. In the mouse intestine, calorie restriction enhances the regenerative capacity of intestinal stem cells by reducing mTORC1 signalling in their Paneth cell niche. Reducing caloric intake while maintaining adequate nutrition extends lifespan in diverse organisms, possibly by preserving stem- and progenitor-cell function. David Sabatini and colleagues show that in the mouse intestine, caloric restriction leads to an increased number of intestinal stem cells (ISC) with enhanced regenerative capacity. The effects are mediated by modulation of mTOR signalling in Paneth cells, important components of the ISC niche. Caloric restriction leads to the expression of the Bst1 gene in Paneth cells and subsequent secretion of cyclic ADP ribose, which acts on ISCs in a paracrine manner. These findings demonstrate a link between the stem-cell function and the nutritional status of an organism, and raise the possibility that mTORC1 inhibitors or Bst1 mimetics may have therapeutic application in improving intestinal regeneration and function."

Harris et al. (p. 1573 ; see the Perspective by Zarin ) used satellite observations of deforestation within the tropics of three continents to estimate that gross annual carbon emissions were approximately 0.8 Pg Cyr −2 (Pg = 10 15 g) for the years 2000 to 2005, from the loss of 43 million hectares of forest. This result, which is about one-third of some previous estimates, should serve as a baseline for future assessments of changes in the rate of loss of tropical forests."
https://openalex.org/W2094831008,"From Wnt Signals to Telomerase Activity Telomerase activity is associated with stem cell renewal and cancers, whereas a decrease in telomerase activity is seen during cell differentiation and senescence. Wnt/β-catenin signaling is also a critical regulator of stem cells, and deregulation of the pathway is associated with cancer. Now, Hoffmeyer et al. (p. 1549 ; see the Perspective by Greider ) have found a link between these two pathways. In embryonic stem cells, β-catenin was able to regulate telomerase expression and activity directly. Similar observations were obtained in adult stem cells, a model of intestinal tumors, and human cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2019558320,"T cells in the brains of Toxoplasma-infected mice are shown to move by Lévy-like walks. T cells are an important first point of contact between the immune system and invading pathogens. The currently accepted model of the early stages of the immune reaction, in which the T cells encounter the invader, is that of a Brownian random walk. This paper reports the use of in vivo multiphoton microscopy to demonstrate that the chemokine CXCL10 enhances the ability of CD8+ T cells to control the protozoon pathogen Toxoplasma gondii. Surprisingly, the in vivo imaging reveals that T cells in the brains of mice infected with T. gondii move not by Brownian-type motion but instead follow a Lévy walk pattern of runs punctuated by periodic pauses. Mathematical simulations suggest that this mode of movement increases the chances of finding targets at unknown locations. Chemokines have a central role in regulating processes essential to the immune function of T cells1,2,3, such as their migration within lymphoid tissues and targeting of pathogens in sites of inflammation. Here we track T cells using multi-photon microscopy to demonstrate that the chemokine CXCL10 enhances the ability of CD8+ T cells to control the pathogen Toxoplasma gondii in the brains of chronically infected mice. This chemokine boosts T-cell function in two different ways: it maintains the effector T-cell population in the brain and speeds up the average migration speed without changing the nature of the walk statistics. Notably, these statistics are not Brownian; rather, CD8+ T-cell motility in the brain is well described by a generalized Lévy walk. According to our model, this unexpected feature enables T cells to find rare targets with more than an order of magnitude more efficiency than Brownian random walkers. Thus, CD8+ T-cell behaviour is similar to Lévy strategies reported in organisms ranging from mussels to marine predators and monkeys4,5,6,7,8,9,10, and CXCL10 aids T cells in shortening the average time taken to find rare targets."

https://openalex.org/W1993051221,"Slide and Find Transcription factors rapidly find their specific binding sites on chromosomal DNA. It has been proposed that searching is facilitated by complementing three-dimensional diffusion with one-dimensional diffusion along DNA. Such sliding on DNA has been observed in vitro, but whether and how far transcription factors slide along chromosomes in vivo is unclear. Hammar et al. (p. 1595 ) used single-molecule imaging to demonstrate that the lac repressor slides into its chromosomal operators in living cells. The average sliding distance was about 45 base pairs, and the repressor frequently slid over its operator before binding."
https://openalex.org/W2006964053,"Plants That Eat Animals Apart from some spectacular exceptions, such as pitcher plants and Venus fly traps, most plants are thought to acquire nitrogen passively from microbial decomposition and the activities of nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Metarhizium species are common endophytes—fungi that live within plant tissues without causing disease. This genus is also found ubiquitously in soil, where they parasitize insects. In a series of microcosm experiments, Behie et al. (p. 1576 ) investigated whether these fungi could couple their endophytic life-styles with their parasitic modes and be a conduit by which plants could obtain nitrogen from animals. Radio-labeled moth larvae were added to the microcosms in which bean and grass plants were grown, and when the larvae were inoculated with fungi, it was only a matter of days before the nitrogen label was detected in the plants."
https://openalex.org/W1992439635,"Avian A/H5N1 influenza viruses pose a pandemic threat. As few as five amino acid substitutions, or four with reassortment, might be sufficient for mammal-to-mammal transmission through respiratory droplets. From surveillance data, we found that two of these substitutions are common in A/H5N1 viruses, and thus, some viruses might require only three additional substitutions to become transmissible via respiratory droplets between mammals. We used a mathematical model of within-host virus evolution to study factors that could increase and decrease the probability of the remaining substitutions evolving after the virus has infected a mammalian host. These factors, combined with the presence of some of these substitutions in circulating strains, make a virus evolving in nature a potentially serious threat. These results highlight critical areas in which more data are needed for assessing, and potentially averting, this threat."
https://openalex.org/W2061034298,"Blasting Through The fungus that causes rice blast disease, Magnaporthe oryzae , can lead to devastating reductions in rice yields. M. oryzae enters the plant by developing specialized infection structures called appressoria. Appressoria generate enormous internal turgor pressure that somehow creates invasive forces that physically break the plant cuticle. Dagdas et al. (p. 1590 ) found that a toroidal (doughnut-shaped) filamentous actin network forms at the base of the appressorium at the precise point where the penetration peg, which ruptures the rice leaf cuticle, will emerge. This network is scaffolded by means of four septin guanosine triphosphatases, which form a dynamic ring structure that colocalizes with F-actin. The findings reveal how fungi translate extreme pressure into localized physical force."
https://openalex.org/W1970731189,"In a superconductor, the ratio of the carrier density, $n$, to their effective mass, $m^*$, is a fundamental property directly reflecting the length scale of the superfluid flow, the London penetration depth, $\lambda_L$. In two dimensional systems, this ratio $n/m^*$ ($\sim 1/\lambda_L^2$) determines the effective Fermi temperature, $T_F$. We report a sharp peak in the $x$-dependence of $\lambda_L$ at zero temperature in clean samples of BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ at the optimum composition $x = 0.30$, where the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ reaches a maximum of 30\,K. This structure may arise from quantum fluctuations associated with a quantum critical point (QCP). The ratio of $T_c/T_F$ at $x = 0.30$ is enhanced, implying a possible crossover towards the Bose-Einstein condensate limit driven by quantum criticality."
https://openalex.org/W2170164026,"Straining Suspended Graphene The electronic properties of graphene are best displayed by suspended sheets free from contact with an underlying substrate. Klimov et al. (p. 1557 ) probed how deformation of suspended graphene sheets could lead to further tuning of its electronic properties with a scanning tunneling microscope; the graphene sheets could also be deformed via an electric field from an underlying electrode. Spectroscopic studies reveal that the induced strain led to charge-carrier localization into spatially confined quantum dots, an effect consistent with the formation of strain-induced pseudomagnetic fields."

https://openalex.org/W2105719699,"The metabolic disturbances that underlie systemic lupus erythematosus are currently unknown. A metabolomic study was executed, comparing the sera of 20 SLE patients against that of healthy controls, using LC/MS and GC/MS platforms. Validation of key differences was performed using an independent cohort of 38 SLE patients and orthogonal assays. SLE sera showed evidence of profoundly dampened glycolysis, Krebs cycle, fatty acid β oxidation and amino acid metabolism, alluding to reduced energy biogenesis from all sources. Whereas long-chain fatty acids, including the n3 and n6 essential fatty acids, were significantly reduced, medium chain fatty acids and serum free fatty acids were elevated. The SLE metabolome exhibited profound lipid peroxidation, reflective of oxidative damage. Deficiencies were noted in the cellular anti-oxidant, glutathione, and all methyl group donors, including cysteine, methionine, and choline, as well as phosphocholines. The best discriminators of SLE included elevated lipid peroxidation products, MDA, gamma-glutamyl peptides, GGT, leukotriene B4 and 5-HETE. Importantly, similar elevations were not observed in another chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease, rheumatoid arthritis. To sum, comprehensive profiling of the SLE metabolome reveals evidence of heightened oxidative stress, inflammation, reduced energy generation, altered lipid profiles and a pro-thrombotic state. Resetting the SLE metabolome, either by targeting selected molecules or by supplementing the diet with essential fatty acids, vitamins and methyl group donors offers novel opportunities for disease modulation in this disabling systemic autoimmune ailment."
https://openalex.org/W2011431889,"Master Regulator Sympathetic neurons and the adrenal medulla are part of the autonomic nervous system, which is important in the control of a variety of bodily functions and in responses to stress. Interactions between the nervous system and the vascular system have been poorly explored. During development, sympathetic neurons and adrenal medulla cells are derived from the same precursors—neural crest cells—embryonic cohorts that undergo massive migration in the body. Using blood vessel–specific gene manipulation in chicken embryos, Saito et al. (p. 1578 ) revealed a role for the dorsal aorta in regulating the early migration of neural crest cells and later in development on the segregation of adrenal medulla and sympathetic neurons. The dorsal aorta expresses multiple soluble morphogenetic and growth factors that regulate complex morphogenesis in a spatiotemporal manner. Furthermore, in mice, the morphogenesis of the adrenal medulla was controlled both by the aorta and the adrenal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2006040339,"DNA methylation is a key regulator of gene expression and changes in DNA methylation occur early in tumorigenesis. Mutations in the de novo DNA methyltransferase gene, DNMT3A, frequently occur in adult acute myeloid leukemia patients with poor prognoses. Most of the mutations occur within the dimer or tetramer interface, including Arg-882. We have identified that the most prevalent mutation, R882H, and three additional mutants along the tetramer interface disrupt tetramerization. The processive methylation of multiple CpG sites is disrupted when tetramerization is eliminated. Our results provide a possible mechanism that accounts for how DNMT3A mutations may contribute to oncogenesis and its progression."

https://openalex.org/W1996316514,"NFκB signaling is critical for expression of genes involved in the vascular injury response. We have shown that estrogen (17β-estradiol, E2) inhibits expression of these genes in an estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent manner in injured rat carotid arteries and in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α treated rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs). This study tested whether E2 inhibits NFκB signaling in RASMCs and defined the mechanisms.TNF-α treated RASMCs demonstrated rapid degradation of IκBα (10-30 min), followed by dramatic increases in IκBα mRNA and protein synthesis (40-60 min). E2 enhanced TNF-α induced IκBα synthesis without affecting IκBα degradation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that E2 pretreatment both enhanced TNF-α induced binding of NFκB p65 to the IκBα promoter and suppressed TNF-α induced binding of NFκB p65 to and reduced the levels of acetylated histone 3 at promoters of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC)-2β genes. ChIP analyses also demonstrated that ERβ can be recruited to the promoters of MCP-1 and CINC-2β during co-treatment with TNF-α and E2.These data demonstrate that E2 inhibits inflammation in RASMCs by two distinct mechanisms: promoting new synthesis of IκBα, thus accelerating a negative feedback loop in NFκB signaling, and directly inhibiting binding of NFκB to the promoters of inflammatory genes. This first demonstration of multifaceted modulation of NFκB signaling by E2 may represent a novel mechanism by which E2 protects the vasculature against inflammatory injury."
https://openalex.org/W1975102846,"In the central nervous system, levels of extraneuronal dopamine are controlled primarily by the action of the dopamine transporter (DAT). Multiple signaling pathways regulate transport activity, substrate efflux, and other DAT functions through currently unknown mechanisms. DAT is phosphorylated by protein kinase C within a serine cluster at the distal end of the cytoplasmic N terminus, whereas recent work in model cells revealed proline-directed phosphorylation of rat DAT at membrane-proximal residue Thr(53). In this report, we use mass spectrometry and a newly developed phospho-specific antibody to positively identify DAT phosphorylation at Thr(53) in rodent striatal tissue and heterologous expression systems. Basal phosphorylation of Thr(53) occurred with a stoichiometry of ~50% and was strongly increased by phorbol esters and protein phosphatase inhibitors, demonstrating modulation of the site by signaling pathways that impact DAT activity. Mutations of Thr(53) to prevent phosphorylation led to reduced dopamine transport V(max) and total apparent loss of amphetamine-stimulated substrate efflux, supporting a major role for this residue in the transport kinetic mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1760596310,"Parkinson disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. The molecular hallmark is the accumulation of proteinaceous inclusions termed Lewy bodies containing misfolded and aggregated α-synuclein. The molecular mechanism of clearance of α-synuclein aggregates was addressed using the bakers' yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the model. Overexpression of wild type α-synuclein or the genetic variant A53T integrated into one genomic locus resulted in a gene copy-dependent manner in cytoplasmic proteinaceous inclusions reminiscent of the pathogenesis of the disease. In contrast, overexpression of the genetic variant A30P resulted only in transient aggregation, whereas the designer mutant A30P/A36P/A76P neither caused aggregation nor impaired yeast growth. The α-synuclein accumulation can be cleared after promoter shut-off by a combination of autophagy and vacuolar protein degradation. Whereas the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 did not significantly inhibit aggregate clearance, treatment with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, an inhibitor of vacuolar proteases, resulted in significant reduction in clearance. Consistently, a cim3-1 yeast mutant restricted in the 19 S proteasome regulatory subunit was unaffected in clearance, whereas an Δatg1 yeast mutant deficient in autophagy showed a delayed aggregate clearance response. A cim3-1Δatg1 double mutant was still able to clear aggregates, suggesting additional cellular mechanisms for α-synuclein clearance. Our data provide insight into the mechanisms yeast cells use for clearing different species of α-synuclein and demonstrate a higher contribution of the autophagy/vacuole than the proteasome system. This contributes to the understanding of how cells can cope with toxic and/or aggregated proteins and may ultimately enable the development of novel strategies for therapeutic intervention."

https://openalex.org/W2033247282,"Deletion of Phe-508 (F508del) in the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) leads to defects in folding and channel gating. NMR data on human F508del NBD1 indicate that an H620Q mutant, shown to increase channel open probability, and the dual corrector/potentiator CFFT-001 similarly disrupt interactions between β-strands S3, S9, and S10 and the C-terminal helices H8 and H9, shifting a preexisting conformational equilibrium from helix to coil. CFFT-001 appears to interact with β-strands S3/S9/S10, consistent with docking simulations. Decreases in T(m) from differential scanning calorimetry with H620Q or CFFT-001 suggest direct compound binding to a less thermostable state of NBD1. We hypothesize that, in full-length CFTR, shifting the conformational equilibrium to reduce H8/H9 interactions with the uniquely conserved strands S9/S10 facilitates release of the regulatory region from the NBD dimerization interface to promote dimerization and thereby increase channel open probability. These studies enabled by our NMR assignments for F508del NBD1 provide a window into the conformational fluctuations within CFTR that may regulate function and contribute to folding energetics."
https://openalex.org/W1979320999,"A major challenge in systems biology is integration of molecular findings for individual enzyme activities into a cohesive high-level understanding of cellular metabolism and physiology/pathophysiology. However, meaningful prediction for how a perturbed enzyme activity will globally impact metabolism in a cell, tissue or intact organisms is precluded by multiple unknowns, including in vivo enzymatic rates, subcellular distribution and pathway interactions. To address this challenge, metabolomics offers the potential to simultaneously survey changes in thousands of structurally diverse metabolites within complex biological matrices. The present study assessed the capability of untargeted plasma metabolite profiling to discover systemic changes arising from inactivation of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), an enzyme that catalyzes the final steps in purine degradation. Using LC-MS coupled with a multivariate statistical data analysis platform, we confidently surveyed >3,700 plasma metabolites (50-1,000 Da) for differential expression in XOR wildtype vs. mice with inactivated XOR, arising from gene deletion or pharmacological inhibition. Results confirmed the predicted derangements in purine metabolism, but also revealed unanticipated perturbations in metabolism of pyrimidines, nicotinamides, tryptophan, phospholipids, Krebs and urea cycles, and revealed kidney dysfunction biomarkers. Histochemical studies confirmed and characterized kidney failure in xor-nullizygous mice. These findings provide new insight into XOR functions and demonstrate the power of untargeted metabolite profiling for systemic discovery of direct and indirect consequences of gene mutations and drug treatments."

https://openalex.org/W1967629651,"The x-ray structure of the prototypic MATE family member, NorM from Vibrio cholerae, reveals a protein fold composed of 12 transmembrane helices (TMHs), confirming hydropathy analyses of the majority of (prokaryotic and plant) MATE transporters. However, the mammalian MATEs are generally predicted to have a 13(th) TMH and an extracellular C terminus. Here we affirm this prediction, showing that the C termini of epitope-tagged, full-length human, rabbit, and mouse MATE1 were accessible to antibodies from the extracellular face of the membrane. Truncation of these proteins at or near the predicted junction between the 13(th) TMH and the long cytoplasmic loop that precedes it resulted in proteins that (i) trafficked to the membrane and (ii) interacted with antibodies only after permeabilization of the plasma membrane. CHO cells expressing rbMate1 truncated at residue Gly-545 supported levels of pH-sensitive transport similar to that of cells expressing the full-length protein. Although the high transport rate of the Gly-545 truncation mutant was associated with higher levels of membrane expression (than full-length MATE1), suggesting the 13(th) TMH may influence substrate translocation, the selectivity profile of the mutant indicated that TMH13 has little impact on ligand binding. We conclude that the functional core of MATE1 consists of 12 (not 13) TMHs. Therefore, we used the x-ray structure of NorM to develop a homology model of the first 12 TMHs of MATE1. The model proved to be stable in molecular dynamic simulations and agreed with topology evident from preliminary cysteine scanning of intracellular versus extracellular loops."

Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in the Drosophila posterior midgut are a well established model to study the complex genetic circuitry that governs stem cell homeostasis. Exposure of the intestinal epithelium to environmental toxins results in the expression of cytokines and growth factors that drive the rapid proliferation and differentiation of ISCs. In the absence of stress signals, ISC homeostasis is maintained through intrinsic pathways. In this study, we uncovered the PDGF- and VEGF-receptor related (Pvr) pathway as an essential regulator of ISC homeostasis under unstressed conditions in the posterior midgut. We found that Pvr is coexpressed with its ligand Pvf2 in ISCs and that hyperactivation of the Pvr pathway distorts the ISC developmental program and drives intestinal dysplasia. In contrast, we show that mutant ISCs in the Pvf/Pvr pathway are defective in homeostatic proliferation and differentiation, resulting in a failure to generate mature cell types. Additionally, we determined that extrinsic stress signals generated by enteropathogenic infection are epistatic to the hypoplasia generated in Pvf/Pvr mutants, making the Pvr pathway unique among all previously studied intrinsic pathways.

The recent discovery of stem cells in the posterior midgut of adult Drosophila melanogaster presents a remarkable system to explore factors that regulate stem cell homeostasis (4Micchelli C.A.

The adult Drosophila posterior midgut is maintained by pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2006; 439: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). This is due to the unequaled genetic tractability of the Drosophila model and the overarching similarities between Drosophila and mammalian intestinal cell types, morphology, developmental patterning, and signaling interactions (2Biteau B.

In turn, EBs differentiate into mature epithelial enterocytes (ECs) or secretory enteroendocrine cells (EEs) (7Jiang H. Edgar B.A. Intestinal stem cells in the adult Drosophila midgut.Exp. Cell Res. 2011; 317: 2780-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Posterior midgut ISCs lie in close contact with the underlying basal lamina established by a meshwork of visceral muscle cells (5Ohlstein B. Spradling A.

Upon ISC division, asymmetric Delta (Dl) expression directs differential Notch (N) signals between the newly formed ISC/EB equivalence group to establish developmental fate through lateral inhibition (10Ohlstein B. Spradling A. Multipotent Drosophila intestinal stem cells specify daughter cell fates by differential notch signaling.Science. 2007; 315: 988-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The basally located Dl positive daughter cell within the niche retains stem cell identity, whereas the opposing N positive daughter cell differentiates into an EB (5Ohlstein B. Spradling A.

The intensity of N signals continues to control EB fate decisions, because high N signals in EBs drive differentiation into mature ECs, whereas low N signals promote the EE cell fate (11Liu W.

The developmental architecture discussed above adequately describes the controls that ensure orderly replenishment of dead epithelial cells under steady state conditions. However, a true genetic evaluation of intestinal integrity must appreciate the intestines as a major interface between an animal and its environment, with intestines continuously exposed to a revolving and unpredictable carousel of pathogenic microbes and toxic molecules. Therefore, modifiable proliferative mechanisms are crucial to ensure epithelial integrity after the ingestion of cytotoxic agents or enteric pathogens. Not surprisingly, Drosophila ISCs use intricate and partially overlapping cell signaling networks that integrate cell intrinsic and extrinsic cues to coordinate tissue homeostasis and maintain midgut epithelial integrity (13Xu N. Wang S.Q. Tan D. Gao Y. Lin G. Xi R. EGFR, Wingless and JAK/STAT signaling cooperatively maintain Drosophila intestinal stem cells.Dev. Biol. 2011; 354: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Exposure to cytotoxic or infectious agents, such as the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas entomophila, rapidly increases ISC mitoses by 10–100-fold to replace dead and dying epithelial cells (14Jiang H.

Combined, these factors engage their cognate receptor on ISCs to promote JAK/STAT and EGF receptor (EGFR) pathways, respectively. These extrinsic signals are then integrated in the ISCs to orchestrate appropriate proliferative and differentiation mechanisms (13Xu N. Wang S.Q. Tan D. Gao Y. Lin G. Xi R. EGFR, Wingless and JAK/STAT signaling cooperatively maintain Drosophila intestinal stem cells.Dev. Biol. 2011; 354: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 18Jiang H. Grenley M.O.

In the absence of extrinsic challenges, ISCs turnover proceeds slowly. The rate of ISC turnover in females is twice that of males, completely regenerating the midgut epithelium in approximately 2–3 weeks (14Jiang H. Patel P.H. Kohlmaier A. Grenley M.O. McEwen D.G. Edgar B.A. Cytokine/Jak/Stat signaling mediates regeneration and homeostasis in the Drosophila midgut.Cell. 2009; 137: 1343-1355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Over the lifespan of the fly, the gut epithelium is exchanged upwards of four times in females and twice in males. The steady replacement of dying ECs emphasizes the need for intrinsic developmental mechanisms that maintain intestinal integrity and function (14Jiang H. Patel P.H. Kohlmaier A. Grenley M.O.

Several ISC intrinsic signaling pathways have been implicated in the maintenance of ISC homeostasis under unstressed conditions, including the insulin receptor, EGFR, and Yorkie/Warts pathway (19Staley B.K.

Basal activity of these receptor tyrosine kinase pathways are essential for the steady state turnover of ISCs, although extrinsic cues feed into these pathways to enhance ISC proliferation in response to infection or damage (18Jiang H.

The Hippo pathway regulates intestinal stem cell proliferation during Drosophila adult midgut regeneration.Development. 2010; 137: 4147-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In this manner, EGFR signals bridge extrinsic and intrinsic cues to regulate gut tissue homeostasis in response to local and systemic conditions (17Buchon N. Broderick N.A. Kuraishi T. Lemaitre B. Drosophila EGFR pathway coordinates stem cell proliferation and gut remodeling following infection.BMC Biol. 2010; 8: 152Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 22Jiang H. Edgar B.A. EGFR signaling regulates the proliferation of Drosophila adult midgut progenitors.Development. 2009; 136: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that an additional Drosophila receptor tyrosine kinase, the PDGF and VEGF receptor-related (Pvr) protein plays a role in the control of posterior midgut physiology (28Choi N.H. Kim J.G. Yang D.J. Kim Y.S. Yoo M.A. Age-related changes in Drosophila midgut are associated with PVF2, a PDGF/VEGF-like growth factor.Aging Cell. 2008; 7: 318-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Pvr is engaged by PDGF- and VEGF-related factors (Pvfs) 1, 2, and 3 to initiate intracellular cascades that instruct cellular activities such as negative regulation of innate immune responses, cell migration, embryonic hemocyte development, and epithelial closure (29Duchek P.

A quantitative RNAi screen for JNK modifiers identifies Pvr as a novel regulator of Drosophila immune signaling.PLoS Pathogens. 2009; 5: e1000655Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the Drosophila gut, Pvr is associated with age-related and oxidative stress-related changes in the posterior midgut (28Choi N.H. Kim J.G. Yang D.J. Kim Y.S. Yoo M.A. Age-related changes in Drosophila midgut are associated with PVF2, a PDGF/VEGF-like growth factor.Aging Cell. 2008; 7: 318-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 39Park J.S.

Yoo M.A. The role of p38b MAPK in age-related modulation of intestinal stem cell proliferation and differentiation in Drosophila.Aging. 2009; 1: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Despite these studies, it is not known whether Pvf/Pvr signals in ISCs are required for maintenance of ISC homeostasis throughout adulthood. In addition to oxidative stress and aging, other studies implicate Pvr in intestinal immune responses. For example, microarray analysis of infected Drosophila guts showed an increase in the expression of pvf1 and pvf2 (21Buchon N. Broderick N.A. Poidevin M. Pradervand S. Lemaitre B. Drosophila intestinal response to bacterial infection. Activation of host defense and stem cell proliferation.Cell Host Microbe. 2009; 5: 200-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). In our own studies, we identified the Pvr pathway as a negative regulator of immune-induced dJNK activation (38Bond D. Foley E. A quantitative RNAi screen for JNK modifiers identifies Pvr as a novel regulator of Drosophila immune signaling.PLoS Pathogens. 2009; 5: e1000655Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We found that infection-induced dJNK activity enhanced the expression of pvf2 and pvf3, which act in a negative feedback loop to suppress innate immune responses (38Bond D. Foley E. A quantitative RNAi screen for JNK modifiers identifies Pvr as a novel regulator of Drosophila immune signaling.PLoS Pathogens. 2009; 5: e1000655Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Given the connections between infection and proliferation in the intestine, we asked whether Pvr is involved in intrinsic or extrinsic control of intestinal homeostasis. Through the course of our investigations, we found that Pvf/Pvr signals are essential for homeostatic control of ISC proliferation and fate specification in the posterior midgut. Our studies revealed that Pvr signals in ISCs are governed through autocrine production of Pvfs. Additionally, we found that extrinsic stresses override hypoplastic defects caused by Pvf/Pvr deficiency in ISCs. In summary, we identified the Pvf/Pvr axis as a critical intrinsic regulator of basal homeostatic mechanisms required for the steady state turnover and faithful differentiation of ISCs in the Drosophila posterior midgut.

https://openalex.org/W2062185796,"Arginine methylation broadly occurs in histones and has been linked to transcriptional regulation, cell cycle regulation and DNA repair. While numerous proteins (histone code effectors) that specifically recognize or read the methylated lysine residues in core histones have been identified, little is known for effectors specific for methylated arginines in histones. In this study, we attempted to identify effector(s) recognizing asymmetrically methylated R17 and R26 in H3, which are catalyzed by CARM1/PRMT4, through an unbiased biochemical approach. Although we have yet to identify such effector using this approach, we find that these modifications function cooperatively with histone acetylation to inhibit the binding of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex (NuRD) and TIF1 family corepressors to H3 tail in vitro. In support of this finding, we show that overexpression of CARM1 in 293 T cells leads to reduced association of NuRD with chromatin, whereas knockdown of CARM1 in HeLa cells leads to increased association of NuRD with chromatin and decreased level of histone acetylation. Furthermore, in the Carm1−/− MEF cells there is an increased association of NuRD and TIF1β with chromatin and a global decrease in histone acetylation. By chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we show that overexpression of CARM1 results in reduced association of NuRD complex and TIF1β with an episomal reporter and that CARM1 is required in MEF cells for LPS-induced dissociation of NuRD from a NF-κb target gene. Taking together, our study provides evidence for a role of CARM1-mediated arginine methylation in regulation of histone acetylation and transcription: facilitating transcription by discharging corepressors from chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1968715270,"The bacterial phosphotransferase system (PTS) is a signal transduction pathway that couples phosphoryl transfer to active sugar transport across the cell membrane. The PTS is initiated by the binding of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to the C-terminal domain (EIC) of enzyme I (EI), a highly conserved protein that is common to all sugar branches of the PTS. EIC exists in a dynamic monomer/dimer equilibrium that is modulated by ligand binding and is thought to regulate the overall PTS. Isolation of EIC has proven challenging, and conformational dynamics within the EIC domain during the catalytic cycle are still largely unknown. Here, we present a robust protocol for expression and purification of recombinant EIC from Escherichia coli and show that isolated EIC is capable of hydrolyzing PEP. NMR analysis and residual dipolar coupling measurements indicate that the isolated EIC domain in solution adopts a stable tertiary fold and quaternary structure that is consistent with previously reported crystallographic data. NMR relaxation dispersion measurements indicate that residues around the PEP binding site and in the β3α3 turn (residues 333–366), which is located at the dimer interface, undergo a rapid transition on the sub-millisecond time scale (with an exchange rate constant of ∼1500 s−1) between major open (∼97%) and minor closed (∼3%) conformations. Upon PEP binding, the β3α3 turn is effectively locked in the closed state by the formation of salt bridges between the phosphate group of PEP and the side chains of Lys340 and Arg358, thereby stabilizing the dimer. The bacterial phosphotransferase system (PTS) is a signal transduction pathway that couples phosphoryl transfer to active sugar transport across the cell membrane. The PTS is initiated by the binding of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to the C-terminal domain (EIC) of enzyme I (EI), a highly conserved protein that is common to all sugar branches of the PTS. EIC exists in a dynamic monomer/dimer equilibrium that is modulated by ligand binding and is thought to regulate the overall PTS. Isolation of EIC has proven challenging, and conformational dynamics within the EIC domain during the catalytic cycle are still largely unknown.

https://openalex.org/W2061436524,"Experience with influenza has shown that predictions of virus phenotype or fitness from nucleotide sequence are imperfect and that predicting the timing and course of evolution is extremely difficult. Such uncertainty means that the risk of experiments with mammalian-transmissible, possibly highly virulent influenza viruses remains high even if some aspects of their laboratory biology are reassuring; it also implies limitations on the ability of laboratory observations to guide interpretation of surveillance of strains in the field. Thus, we propose that future experiments with virulent pathogens whose accidental or deliberate release could lead to extensive spread in human populations should be limited by explicit risk-benefit considerations."
https://openalex.org/W2018665585,"In nitric-oxide synthases (NOSs), two flexible hinges connect the FMN domain to the rest of the enzyme and may guide its interactions with partner domains for electron transfer and catalysis. We investigated the role of the FMN-FAD/NADPH hinge in rat neuronal NOS (nNOS) by constructing mutants that either shortened or lengthened this hinge by 2, 4, and 6 residues. Shortening the hinge progressively inhibited electron flux through the calmodulin (CaM)-free and CaM-bound nNOS to cytochrome c, whereas hinge lengthening relieved repression of electron flux in CaM-free nNOS and had no impact or slowed electron flux through CaM-bound nNOS to cytochrome c. How hinge length influenced heme reduction depended on whether enzyme flavins were pre-reduced with NADPH prior to triggering heme reduction. Without pre-reduction, changing the hinge length was deleterious; with pre-reduction, the hinge shortening was deleterious, and hinge lengthening increased heme reduction rates beyond wild type. Flavin fluorescence and stopped-flow kinetic studies on CaM-bound enzymes suggested hinge lengthening slowed the domain-domain interaction needed for FMN reduction. All hinge length changes lowered NO synthesis activity and increased uncoupled NADPH consumption. We conclude that several aspects of catalysis are sensitive to FMN-FAD/NADPH hinge length and that the native hinge allows a best compromise among the FMN domain interactions and associated electron transfer events to maximize NO synthesis and minimize uncoupled NADPH consumption."
https://openalex.org/W2017291434,"We examined the profiling of gene expression of metallothioneins (MTs) in human tissues from cadaver eyes with microarray-based analysis. All MT1 isoforms, with the exception of MT1B, were abundantly expressed in lens and corneal tissue. Along with MT1B, MT4 was not detected in any tissues. Antibodies to MT1/2 labeled the corneal epithelial and endothelial cells, whereas MT3 label the retinal ganglion cells. We studied the effects of zinc and cytokines on the gene expression of MT isoforms in a corneal epithelial cell line (HCEsv). Zinc exerted an up-regulation of the expression of MT isoforms, and this effect was further potentiated in the presence of IL1α or TNFα. Zinc also elicited a strong down-regulation of the expression of inflammatory cytokines, and this effect was blocked in the presence of TNFα or IL1α. The concentration of MTs, bound zinc, and the metal stoichiometry of MTs in cultured HCEsv were determined by mass spectrometry. The total concentration of MTs was 0.24 ± 0.03 μm and, after 24 h of zinc exposure, increased to 0.96 ± 0.01 μm. The combination of zinc and IL1α further enhanced the level of MTs to 1.13 ± 0.03 μm. The average metal stoichiometry of MTs was Zn6Cu1-MT, and after exposure to the different treatments, it changed to Zn7-MT. Actinomycin D blocked transcription, and cycloheximide attenuated synthesis of MTs in the presence or absence of zinc, suggesting transcriptional regulation. Overall the data provide molecular and analytical evidence on the interplay between zinc, MTs, and proinflammatory cytokines in HCEsv cells, with potential implications on cell-based inflammatory eye diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2151144459,"Misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are dislocated to the cytosol to be degraded by the proteasomes. Various plant and bacterial toxins and certain viruses hijack this dislocation pathway to exert their toxicity or to infect cells. In this study, we report a dislocation-dependent reconstituted GFP (drGFP) assay that allows, for the first time, imaging proteins dislocated from the ER lumen to the cytosol in living cells. Our results indicate that both luminal and membrane-spanning ER proteins can be fully dislocated from the ER to the cytosol. By combining the drGFP assay with RNAi or chemical inhibitors of proteins in the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase complex, we demonstrate that the Sel1L, Hrd1, p97/VCP, and importin β proteins are required for the dislocation of misfolded luminal α-1 antitrypsin. The strategy described in this work is broadly applicable to the study of other types of transmembrane transport of proteins and likely also of viruses and toxins in living cells."
https://openalex.org/W2070753511,"Because of the increasing gap between the data from sequencing and structural genomics, the accurate prediction of the structural class of a protein domain solely from the primary sequence has remained a challenging problem in structural biology. Traditional sequence-based predictors generally select several sequence features and then feed them directly into a classification program to identify the structural class. The current best sequence-based predictor achieved an overall accuracy of 74.1% when tested on a widely used, non-homologous benchmark dataset 25PDB. In the present work, we built a multiple linear regression (MLR) model to convert the 440-dimensional (440D) sequence feature vector extracted from the Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) of a protein domain to a 4-dimensinal (4D) structural feature vector, which could then be used to predict the four major structural classes. We performed 10-fold cross-validation and jackknife tests of the method on a large non-homologous dataset containing 8,244 domains distributed among the four major classes. The performance of our approach outperformed all of the existing sequence-based methods and had an overall accuracy of 83.1%, which is even higher than the results of those predicted secondary structure-based methods."

The publication of two avian influenza studies has brought the DURC issue back into sharp focus and has resulted in a new set of federal guidelines. However, the new DURC policy raises questions regarding whether this is the best policy solution to a complicated biosecurity concern."
https://openalex.org/W2023822944,"Two closely related β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases, β4GalNAc-T3 and β4GalNAc-T4, are thought to account for the protein-specific addition of β1,4-linked GalNAc to Asn-linked oligosaccharides on a number of glycoproteins including the glycoprotein hormone luteinizing hormone and carbonic anhydrase-6 (CA6). We have utilized soluble, secreted forms of β4GalNAc-T3 and β4GalNAc-T4 to define the basis for protein-specific GalNAc transfer in vitro to chimeric substrates consisting of Gaussia luciferase followed by a glycoprotein substrate. Transfer of GalNAc by β4GalNAc-T3 and β4GalNAc-T4 to terminal GlcNAc is divalent cation-dependent. Transfer of GalNAc to glycoprotein acceptors that contain a peptide recognition determinant is maximal between 0.5 and 1.0 mM MnCl(2); however, transfer is increasingly inhibited by concentrations of MnCl(2) above 1 mM and by anion concentrations above 15 mM. In contrast, transfer of GalNAc to the simple sugar acceptor N-acetylglucosamine-β-p-nitrophenol (GlcNAcβ-pNP) is not inhibited by concentrations of MnCl(2) or anions that would inhibit transfer to glycoprotein acceptors by >90%. This finding indicates that interaction with the peptide recognition determinant in the substrate is sensitive to the anion concentration. β4GalNAc-T3 and β4GalNAc-T4 have similar but distinct specificities, resulting in a 42-fold difference in the IC(50) for transfer of GalNAc to chimeric glycoprotein substrates by agalacto human chorionic gonadotropin, comprising 29 nM for β4GalNAc-T3 and 1.2 μM for β4GalNAc-T4. Our in vitro analysis indicates that enzymatic recognition of the peptide determinant and the oligosaccharide acceptor are independent events."
https://openalex.org/W2131487640,"RecQ family helicases and topoisomerase 3 enzymes form evolutionary conserved complexes that play essential functions in DNA replication, recombination, and repair, and in vitro, show coordinate activities on model recombination and replication intermediates. Malfunctioning of these complexes in humans is associated with genomic instability and cancer-prone syndromes. Although both RecQ-like and topoisomerase 3 enzymes are present in archaea, only a few of them have been studied, and no information about their functional interaction is available. We tested the combined activities of the RecQ-like helicase, Hel112, and the topoisomerase 3, SsTop3, from the thermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus. Hel112 showed coordinate DNA unwinding and annealing activities, a feature shared by eukaryotic RecQ homologs, which resulted in processing of synthetic Holliday junctions and stabilization of model replication forks. SsTop3 catalyzed DNA relaxation and annealing. When assayed in combination, SsTop3 inhibited the Hel112 helicase activity on Holliday junctions and stimulated formation and stabilization of such structures. In contrast, Hel112 did not affect the SsTop3 DNA relaxation activity. RecQ-topoisomerase 3 complexes show structural similarity with the thermophile-specific enzyme reverse gyrase, which catalyzes positive supercoiling of DNA and was suggested to play a role in genome stability at high temperature. Despite such similarity and the high temperature of reaction, the SsTop3-Hel112 complex does not induce positive supercoiling and is thus likely to play different roles. We propose that the interplay between Hel112 and SsTop3 might regulate the equilibrium between recombination and anti-recombination activities at replication forks."

https://openalex.org/W1978195298,"N- and O-linked oligosaccharides on pro-opiomelanocortin both bear the unique terminal sequence SO4-4-GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ. We previously demonstrated that protein-specific transfer of GalNAc to N-linked oligosaccharides on glycoprotein substrates is dependent on the presence of both an oligosaccharide acceptor and a peptide recognition motif consisting of a cluster of basic amino acids. We characterized how two β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases, β4GalNAc-T3 and β4GalNAc-T4, require the presence of both the peptide recognition motif and the N-linked oligosaccharide acceptors to transfer GalNAc in β1,4-linkage to GlcNAc in vivo and in vitro. We now show that β4GalNAc-T3 and β4GalNAc-T4 are able to utilize the same peptide motif to selectively add GalNAc to β1,6-linked GlcNAc in core 2 O-linked oligosaccharide structures to form Galβ1,3(GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,6)GalNAcαSer/Thr. The β1,4-linked GalNAc can be further modified with 4-linked sulfate by either GalNAc-4-sulfotransferase 1 (GalNAc-4-ST1) (CHST8) or GalNAc-4-ST2 (CHST9) or with α2,6-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid by α2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6Gal1), thus generating a family of unique GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ (LacdiNAc)-containing structures on specific glycoproteins.

https://openalex.org/W2054787008,"Crystal structures of the CorA Mg(2+) channel have suggested that metal binding in the cytoplasmic domain stabilizes the pentamer in a closed conformation. The open ""metal free"" state of the channel is, however, still structurally uncharacterized. Here, we have attempted to map conformational states of CorA from Thermotoga maritima by determining which residues support the pentameric structure in the presence or absence of Mg(2+). We find that when Mg(2+) is present, the pentamer is stabilized by the putative gating sites (M1/M2) in the cytoplasmic domain. Strikingly however, we find that the conserved and functionally important periplasmic loop is vital for the integrity of the pentamer when Mg(2+) is absent from the M1/M2 sites. Thus, although the periplasmic loops were largely disordered in the x-ray structures of the closed channel, our data suggests a prominent role for the loops in stabilizing the open conformation of the CorA channels."

https://openalex.org/W1967865169,"The response of the postnatal heart to growth and stress stimuli includes activation of a network of signal transduction cascades, including the stress activated protein kinases such as p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) pathways. In response to increased workload, the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) MEK1 has been shown to be active. Studies embarking on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades in the heart have indicated peroxisome-proliferators activated-receptors (PPARs) as downstream effectors that can be regulated by this signaling cascade. Despite the importance of PPARα in controlling cardiac metabolism, little is known about the relationship between MAPK signaling and cardiac PPARα signaling.Using co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence approaches we show a complex formation of PPARα with MEK1 and not with ERK1/2. Binding of PPARα to MEK1 is mediated via a LXXLL motif and results in translocation from the nucleus towards the cytoplasm, hereby disabling the transcriptional activity of PPARα. Mice subjected to voluntary running-wheel exercise showed increased cardiac MEK1 activation and complex formation with PPARα, subsequently resulting in reduced PPARα activity. Inhibition of MEK1, using U0126, blunted this effect.Here we show that activation of the MEK1-ERK1/2 pathway leads to specific inhibition of PPARα transcriptional activity. Furthermore we show that this inhibitory effect is mediated by MEK1, and not by its downstream effector kinase ERK1/2, through a mechanism involving direct binding to PPARα and subsequent stimulation of PPARα export from the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1968306243,"Spectrins line the intracellular surface of plasmalemma and play a critical role in supporting cytoskeletal stability and flexibility. Spectrins can be proteolytically degraded by calpains and caspases, yielding breakdown products (SBDPs) of various molecular sizes, with SBDP120 being largely derived from caspase-3 cleavage. SBDPs are putative biomarkers for traumatic brain injury. The levels of SBDPs also elevate in the brain during aging and perhaps in Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the cellular basis for this change is currently unclear. Here we examined age-related SBDP120 alteration in forebrain neurons in rats and in the triple transgenic model of AD (3×Tg-AD) relative to non-transgenic controls. SBDP120 immunoreactivity (IR) was found in cortical neuronal somata in aged rats, and was prominent in the proximal dendrites of the olfactory bulb mitral cells. Western blot and densitometric analyses in wild-type mice revealed an age-related elevation of intraneuronal SBDP120 in the forebrain which was more robust in their 3×Tg-AD counterparts. The intraneuronal SBDP120 occurrence was not spatiotemporally correlated with transgenic amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression, β-amyloid plaque development, or phosphorylated tau expression over various forebrain regions or lamina. No microscopically detectable in situ activated caspase-3 was found in the nuclei of SBDP120-containing neurons. The present study demonstrates the age-dependent intraneuronal presence of an αII-spectrin cleavage fragment in mammalian forebrain which is exacerbated in a transgenic model of AD. This novel neuronal alteration indicates that impairments in membrane protein metabolism, possibly due to neuronal calcium mishandling and/or enhancement of calcium sensitive proteolysis, occur during aging and in transgenic AD mice."
https://openalex.org/W2023929352,"Non-receptor-tyrosine kinases (protein-tyrosine kinases) and non-receptor tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) have been implicated in the regulation of ion channels, neuronal excitability, and synaptic plasticity. We previously showed that protein-tyrosine kinases such as Src kinase and PTPs such as PTPα and PTPε modulate the activity of delayed-rectifier K(+) channels (I(K)). Here we show cultured cortical neurons from PTPε knock-out (EKO) mice to exhibit increased excitability when compared with wild type (WT) mice, with larger spike discharge frequency, enhanced fast after-hyperpolarization, increased after-depolarization, and reduced spike width. A decrease in I(K) and a rise in large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) currents (mBK) were observed in EKO cortical neurons compared with WT. Parallel studies in transfected CHO cells indicate that Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv7.2/7.3, and mBK are plausible molecular correlates of this multifaceted modulation of K(+) channels by PTPε. In CHO cells, Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv7.2/7.3 K(+) currents were up-regulated by PTPε, whereas mBK channel activity was reduced. The levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv7.3, and mBK potassium channels were increased in the brain cortices of neonatal and adult EKO mice compared with WT, suggesting that PTPε in the brain modulates these channel proteins. Our data indicate that in EKO mice, the lack of PTPε-mediated dephosphorylation of Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv7.3 leads to decreased I(K) density and enhanced after-depolarization. In addition, the deficient PTPε-mediated dephosphorylation of mBK channels likely contributes to enhanced mBK and fast after-hyperpolarization, spike shortening, and consequent increase in neuronal excitability observed in cortical neurons from EKO mice."
https://openalex.org/W2034763308,"The control of several catabolic operons in bacteria by transcription antitermination is mediated by RNA-binding proteins that consist of an RNA-binding domain and two reiterated phosphotransferase system regulation domains (PRDs). The Bacillus subtilis GlcT antitermination protein regulates the expression of the ptsG gene, encoding the glucose-specific enzyme II of the phosphotransferase system. In the absence of glucose, GlcT becomes inactivated by enzyme II-dependent phosphorylation at its PRD1, whereas the phosphotransferase HPr phosphorylates PRD2. However, here we demonstrate by NMR analysis and mass spectrometry that HPr also phosphorylates PRD1 in vitro but with low efficiency. Size exclusion chromatography revealed that non-phosphorylated PRD1 forms dimers that dissociate upon phosphorylation. The effect of HPr on PRD1 was also investigated in vivo. For this purpose, we used GlcT variants with altered domain arrangements or domain deletions. Our results demonstrate that HPr can target PRD1 when this domain is placed at the C terminus of the protein. In agreement with the in vitro data, HPr exerts a negative control on PRD1. This work provides the first insights into how specificity is achieved in a regulator that contains duplicated regulatory domains with distinct dimerization properties that are controlled by phosphorylation by different phosphate donors. Moreover, the results suggest that the domain arrangement of the PRD-containing antitermination proteins is under selective pressure to ensure the proper regulatory output, i.e. transcription antitermination of the target genes specifically in the presence of the corresponding sugar."
