https://openalex.org/W4247563372,"The existence of a monoclinic phase of hydroxyapatite, Ca(2)(PO(4))(4)OH, has been confirmed, by single-crystal structure analysis (weighted ""reliability"" factor = 3.9 percent on |F|(2)). The structure has space group P21/b, a = 9.4214(8) angstroms, b = 2a, c = 6.8814(7) angstroms, and gamma = 120 degrees , and is analogous to that of chlorapatite. The distortions from the hexagonal structure with which the monoclinic structure is pseudosymmetric are similar to those in chlorapatite, including enlargement of that triangular array of oxygen atoms in which the chlorine ion or, in hydroxyapatite, the hydroxyl hydrogen ion is approximately centered. The hydroxyapatite specimen was prepared by the conversion of a single crystal of chlorapatite in steam at 1200 degrees C, was mimetically twinned, and was approximately 37 percent monoclinic."
https://openalex.org/W2055157304,The partition of europium between plagioclase feldspar and magmatic liquid is considered in terms of the distribution coefficients for divalent and trivalent europium. A model equation is derived giving the europium anomaly in plagioclase as a function of temperature and oxygen fugacity. The model explains europium anomalies in plagioclase synthesized under controlled laboratory conditions as well as the variations of the anomaly observed in natural terrestrial and extraterrestrial igneous rocks.

If not triggered by impacts, then it was as ""efficient"" as terrestrial avalanches attributed to air-cushion sliding. Evidently lunar avalanches are able to flow despite the lack of lubricating fluid."
https://openalex.org/W2015994393,Laboratory-raised Northeirn blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata) have been observed tearing pieces from pages of newspaper and utilizing them as tools to rake in food pellets which were otherwise out of reach. The frequency of this behavior was dependenit upon the motivational state of the jay and the presence of food pellets.
https://openalex.org/W2094729472,"exists a relation between the power of regeneration of a part and its liability to injury. Certain well-established facts in regard to the regeneration of internal organs are entirely overlooked or disregarded in the attempt to show that the above relation explains the origin of regeneration. It would be interesting if those who hold that there is no such thing as a general power of regeneration; in each kind of animal this power is graduated according to the need of regeneration in the part under consideration, it would be interesting if such persons would show how such a thing could arise by means of variation  and survival of the fittest."

Commnlunication between the sexes of each species is separated effectively by a different blendinig of both compounds by the females and a different response to these blends by the males."

https://openalex.org/W1978593172,Apollo 17 seismic data are interpreted to determine the structure of the lunar crust to a depth of several kilometers. Seismic velocity increases in a marked stepwise manner beneath the Taurus-Littrow region at the Apollo 17 site. A thickness of about 1200 meters is indicated for the infilling mare basalts at Taurus-Littrow. The apparent velocity is high (about 4 kilomleters per second) in the material immediately underlying the basalts.
https://openalex.org/W2018089734,"The formation and development of a zone of spreading beneath the continental crust resulted in the breakup of Pangea and formation of the Atlantic Ocean. The crust of Morocco bears an extremely complete record of the crustal response to this episode of mantle dynamics. Structural and related depositional patterns indicate that the African margin had stabilized by the Middle Jurassic as a marine carbonate environment; that it was dominated by tensile stresses in the early Mesozoic, resulting in two fault systems paralleling the Atlantic and Mediterranean margins and a basin and range structural-depositional style; and that it was affected by late Paleozoic metamorphism and intrusion. Mesozoic events record the latter portion of African involvement in the spreading episode; late Paleozoic thermal orogenesis might reflect the earlier events in the initiation of the spreading center and its development beneath significant continental crust. In that case, more than 100 million years were required for mantle dynamics to break up Pangea."

https://openalex.org/W2049370383,"A new class of models is proposed to describe the dynamic processes leading to the establishment of regular spatial patterns of structures in natural systems. Simple mathematical arguments are used to compute the saturating densities of the distributions, and these results are verified by computer simulation of model systems."

https://openalex.org/W2035125591,"An instrument providing a new, rapid, and accurate method of determining the number and critical radii of condensation nuclei with radii under 200 angstroms is described. Based on the principle of the cloud chamber, the instrument measures transient changes in the attenuation and scattering of a monochromatic light beam by the growing fog droplets. From data obtained the absolute number concentration and radii of condensation nuclei can be calculated. Preliminary studies of aerosol formation in beta-irradiated mixtures of air and sulfur dioxide showed that carbon monoxide and methane inhibit the formation of nuclei; relative rate constants can be deduced. Some applications of this instrument for environmental and basic research are pointed out."

In column 3, page 50, the statement, thus maps an area of about km 2 every day, should read 6.5 x 10 6 km 2 . In Fig. 3, the land masses are identified as Manhattan and Staten Island; actually, the spit at the left of the figure is Sandy Hook, New Jersey, and the barrier beaches further north are Rockaway, Long Beach, and Jones Beach, from left to right. The negative for Fig. 4 was inadvertently flipped over so that the illustration is a mirror image of the actual picture. It has also since been brought to the author9s attention that  the previously unsuspected difference in salinity in the Great Salt Lake described in the caption of Fig. 2 was, in fact, well known before the ERTS picture was taken."
https://openalex.org/W1989371408,A scanning field-emission electron microscope combined with an x-ray analyzer is used to locate the ice nucleus within a three-dimensional image of a snow crystal and determine the chemical composition of the nucleus. This makes it possible to better understand the effect of nuclei in cloud seeding.

https://openalex.org/W4251919349,"One hears often of the financial contributions made by the United States to the support of activities within the U.N. system, but much less frequently about benefits obtained. A particular instance of the latter is worth citing. An analysis was recently made by N.W. Axnick and J.M. Lane (3) of the costs associated with the protection of the United States against smallpox in 1968. This was estimated to be $153.8 million, of which $0.7 million was contributed to WHO specially earmarked for its smallpox eradication program, and $3 million in U.S. bilateral assistance to 19 countries in West Africa. Ihe success of the WHO-directed smallpox eradication program throughout the world has resulted in a 1972 decision by U.S. authorities to discontinue routine vaccination of the general population and of smallpox vaccination requirements for international travel to smallpox-free countries, which was estimated to involve economic costs of $135.7 million during 1968. The total current U.S. contribution (1972) to all activities of WHO is $27.6 million. Thus it will be seen that very substantial savings, probably exceding $100 million annually, wili accrue to the United States from the work of WHO on smallpox alone."
