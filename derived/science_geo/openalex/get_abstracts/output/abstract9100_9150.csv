(1977) Nature 268, 462-464). Our experiments indicate that the increase in the relative amounts of multiacetylated forms of histones H4 and H3 following butyrate treatment is the result of an inhibition of histone deacetylase activity."

The areas of space to which these units responded (their receptive fields) were largely independent of the nature and intensity of the sound stimulus. The units were arranged systematically within the midbrain auditory nucleus according to the relative locations of their receptive fields, thus creating a physiological map of auditory space."

No changes were detected in other limbic forebrain regions, including the hypothalamus and the medial olfactory (preoptic) area. The results point to the possibility of a malfunction of limbic noradrenergic mechanisms in schizophrenia, especially the paranoid variety."

Muscle biopsies were histologically normal but lacked adenylate deaminase by stain and solution assay, while the erythrocyte isozyme was normal. A clinical diagnostic test has been developed, and the human enzyme was separated by acrylamide-gel electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W1999722081,"Many of the motor neurons in the lobster (Panulirus interruptus) stomatogastric ganglion exhibit plateau potentials; that is, prolonged regenerative depolarizations resulting from active membrane properties, that drive the neurons to fire impulses during bursts. Plateaus are latent in isolated ganglia but are unmasked by central input. These findings emphasize the role of cellular properties as compared to synaptic wiring in the production of cyclic motor patterns by ensembles of neurons."

At low temperatures initial binding is restricted to the plasma membrane as detected by direct quantitative autoradiographic analysis with the electron microscope. With increasing time and temperature of incubation there is a systematic and progressive translocation of autoradiographic grains to a highly limited area of the cell periphery representing no more than 15 percent of the radius of the cell.
https://openalex.org/W2079635246,"The auditory cortex of the mustache bat, Pteronotus parnellii rubiginosus, is composed of functional divisions which are differently organized to be suited for processing the elements of its biosonar signal according to their biological significance. Unlike the Doppler-shifted-CF (constant frequency) processing area, the area processing the frequency-modulated components does not show clear tonotopic and amplitopic representations, but consists of several clusters of neurons, each of which is sensitive to a particular combination (or combinations) of information-bearing elements of the biosonar signal and echoes. The response properties of neurons in the major clusters indicate that processing of information carried by the frequency-modulated components of echoes is facilitated by the first harmonic of the emitted biosonar signal. The properties of some of these neurons suggest that they are tuned to a target which has a particular cross-sectional area and which is located at a particular distance."

Other tumor-promoting macrocyclic plant diterpenes also inhibit neurite formation, whereas nonpromoting diterpenes do not. Inhibition by TPA was reversible and was unrelated to toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1547744139,"The refolding and reoxidation of fully reduced and denatured chymotrypsinogen A have been studied in the presence of low concentrations of guanidine HCl or urea. Renaturation yields of 60 to 70% were observed when the reoxidation was facilitated by mixtures of reduced and oxidized glutathione. Refolding occurred within a narrow range of denaturant concentration (1.0 to 1.3 M guanidine HCl and 2 M urea) in which the native protein was shown to be stable, and the reduced protein was shown to regain the correct disulfide pairing. Renatured chymotrypsinogen is indistinguishable from the native zymogen in chromatographic behavior, potential chymotryptic activity, sedimentation coefficient, and spectral properties. The kinetics of renaturation were determined. Some of the protein species obtained at various times of renaturation were characterized as incorrectly oxidized molecules which could be renatured by thiol-catalyzed interchange of disulfide bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1982735518,"Spined pyriform interneurons in community-reared jewel fish have more dendritic branches and spines in the deep tectal layers than those in isolates reared without visual-tactile contact with conspecifics. Furthermore, in the same dendritic loci in which the community-reared fish had more spines, the spine stems were shorter. The findings suggest that social stimulation induces localized formation of spines, which swell with synaptic activation. Shortening of the spine stem through elongated swelling of the spine head is likely to alter synaptic effectiveness through changes in electrotonic conductance."
https://openalex.org/W2022186492,"Skin test reactivity, lymphocyte transformation, and mononuclear cell tissue factor generation were evaluated both before and during systemic anticoagulation in 24 volunteers. Anticoagulation with warfarin decreased skin test induration and tissue factor generation, but lymphocyte trnasformation remained unchanged. An intact coagulation mechanism, including tissue factor generation, appears to be important for the development of skin test induration in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2045304963,Defensive medicine--the use of diagnostic and end-treatment measures explicitly for the purposes of averting malpractice suits--is frequently cited as one of the least desirable effects of the current rise in medical litigation. Many physicians and policy-makers claim that defensive medicine is responsible not only for the increasing costs of health care but the exposing of patients to significant risks of harm from unnecessary procedures. Very little solid information is available about defensive medicine. The studies that have been conducted have been fraught with statistical difficulties and are by no means definitive. Even more important than the issue of defensive medicine is the more basic problem of our system of compensation for medical injuries.

https://openalex.org/W2078761017,"Relations between calcium entry and activation of a calcium-dependent outward current during depolarization were examined under voltage clamp in dorid giant neurons injected with the calcium-sensitive photoprotein aequorin. Activation kinetics and amplitude of the slow calcium-dependent component were both found to be related to the rate and extent of free calcium accumulation and to the electromotive force acting on potassium ions, independent of the calcium activation kinetics. This indicates that the activation of the calcium-dependent outward current is more closely related to the transient intracellular accumulation of free calcium ions than to the movement of calcium through the plasma membrane during depolarization."
https://openalex.org/W1970677035,"The intracellular calcium concentration in the cytoplasm decreased and the calcium concentration near the cell membrane increased during bursting activity induced by pentylenetetrazole in snail neuron. Incubation in medium containing cobalt chloride or lanthanum chloride did not change this tendency, which suggests that this calcium distribution change is due to the stored calcium in the subcellular structure moving toward the cell membrane."

They are located at the outer ends of the inner segments of the cones of certain fishes. Although, superficially, they resemble the similarly located oil droplets in the cones of birds and reptiles, their ultrastructure and staining properties resemble those of the neighboring mitochondria. However, like the oil droplets, they may serve as intracellular color filters."

https://openalex.org/W2073453655,"Since the induction of sister chromatid exchanges in cultured cells has been shown to be the most sensitive mammalian system to detect the effects of mutagenic carcinogens, Chinese hamster ovary cells and human lymphocytes were exposed to the sodium saccharin found to induce bladder cancer in rats. Both that saccharin and a highly purified extract of it increased the yield of sister chromatid exchanges in both types of cells. The results, which were repeatable and statistically highly significant, indicated that the weak carcinogen, saccharin, is also mutagenic in the sense that it induces cytogenetic changes."
https://openalex.org/W2010692062,"The complete circle rule of the polar coordinate model of pattern regulation was tested for regenerating hindlimbs of Ambystoma larvae. The hindlimbs were made symmetrical in the circumference of either the thigh or the shank, and their ability to regenerate from both levels was observed. Thighs composed of two anterior halves failed to regenerate, whereas thighs composed of two posterior halves often regenerated distally complete, correspondingly symmetrical limbs; shanks composed of either two anterior or two posterior halves regenerated distally complete, correspondingly symmetrical limbs. These results are in contrast to what is predicted by the complete circle rule and suggest a modification of this rule."
https://openalex.org/W1525814142,"The molybdenum-iron protein of Azotobacter vinelandii nitrogenase was separated into two subunits of equal concentration by ion exchange chromatography on sulfopropyl (SP) Sephadex at pH 5.4 in 7 M urea. Better than 90% yield of each subunit was obtained on a preparative scale if the reduced carboxymethylated molybdenum-iron protein was incubated at 45 degrees C for 45 min prior to chromatography. Without the heating step low yields of the subunits were obtained. Although the amino acid compositions of the two subunits were very similar, the NH2-terminal sequences were completely different as determined by automated sequential Edman degradation. The sequence for the alpha subunit was NH2-Ser-Gln-Gln-Val-Asp-Lys-Ile-Lys-Ala-Ser-Tyr-Pro-Leu-Phe-Leu-Asp-Gln-Asp-Tyr- and for the beta subunit the sequence was NH2-Thr-Gly-Met-Ser-Arg-Glu-Glu-Val-Glu-Ser-Leu-Ile-Gln-Glu-Val-Leu-Glu-Val-Tyr-. Likewise the COOH-terminal sequences for the two subunits, as determined with carboxypeptidase Y, were tota-ly different. The sequence for the alpha subunit was -Leu-Arg-Val-COOH and that for the beta subunit was -Ile-(Phe, Glu)-Ala-Phe-COOH. Radioautographs of tryptic peptide maps were prepared for the molybdenum-iron protein and the two subunits which had been labeled at the cysteinyl residues with iodo[2-14C]acetic acid. These maps indicated that the two subunits had no cysteinyl peptides in common and that the cysteinyl residues were clustered in both subunits."

Progress in identifying and quantifying risk factors is opening the way to the prevention of disease and maintenance of health. Systematic, controlled trials of intervention against risk factors are beginning to produce evidence on the extent of success in reducing both the factors and the mortality from associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1562963538,"Of the two diastereoisomers of uridine-5'[1-thiotriphosphate] differing in configuration at Palpha, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase catalyzes the reaction of the one designated isomer B (Eckstein, F. (1975) Angew. Chem, Int. Ed. Engl. 14, 160-166) with glucose-1-P to produce uridine-5'[1-thiodiphosphate]glucose. Mild acid hydrolysis of the latter, under conditions known to be minimal for the hydrolysis of aldose phosphates, produces diastereoisomer A of uridine-5'[1-thiodiphosphate]. Therefore, the reaction of uridine-5'[1-thiotriphosphate](B) with glucose-1-P catalyzed by UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase occurs with stereochemical inversion at Palpha to produce uridine-5'[1-thiodiphosphate]glucose(A). The 31P NMR spectra of these nucleotides are presented and used to elucidate the stereochemical course of the reaction. The apparent Km exhibited by this enzyme for uridine-5'[1-thiodiphosphate]glucose isomer A at 2 mM pyrophosphate and pH 7.6 is 75 micron, which is only 2.2 times that for UDP-glucose, 35 micron. The maximal velocity for UDP-glucose is 11 times that for uridine-5'[1-thiodiphosphate]glucose isomer A under these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2065593480,"The rapid expansion of knowledge in human and medical genetics has revealed at least 6 percent average heterozygosity per structural gene locus, in excess of 2300 Mendelian (single gene) variants and several hundred chromosomal variants in man. This means that with the exception of monozygous twins, no two individuals are alike in their phenotype. Therefore, each person has a relative state of health, and genetic factors contribute significantly to disease. The ubiquity of genetic diversity requires the development of services for genetic screening, diagnosis, and counseling to prevent and treat a major portion of disease in modern society. Specific programs in Quebec and Canada illustrate how individuals and populations can be served by such services. Better education of citizens and health professionals in human genetics is essential for the further improvement of genetics services in society."

Discrete intracellular structures corresponding in location to dense bodies contained high concentrations of fluorine. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy, which apparently can detect less than 10(-20) gram of fluorine in an area of 10 square nonometers, can thus localize fluorinated tracer molecules with biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W1505816070,"When the polypeptide initiation sequence is interrupted by the peptide antibiotic edeine, the sedimentation coefficient of the native small ribosomal subunit is increased from 43 S to 48 S. Formation of the 48 SN particle is absolutely dependent on the binding of both Met-tRNAf and globin mRNA. These results support the concept that Met-tRNAf binds to the native small ribosomal subunit before mRNA, and that processes involved in mRNA binding to the 43 SN preinitiation complex may be the rate-limiting step of 80 S initiation complex formation."
https://openalex.org/W1576132315,"Abstract A sulfated neolactotetraosylceramide has been isolated from the lipid extract of hog gastric mucosa. Isolation procedure involved extraction of lipids with 0.4 M sodium acetate in methanol/chloroform/water, alkaline methanolysis, column fractionation on DEAE-Sephadex, separation of the acetylated acidic glycolipids on silicic acid column, and thin layer chromatography. By partial acid hydrolysis, sequential hydrolysis with specific glycosidases, periodate oxidation, and methylation analysis of the native and desulfated compound, the structure of this glycolipid is proposed to be: Galbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAc(6 comes from SO3)beta1 leads to 3Galbeta1 leads to 4Glc1 leads to 1 ceramide."
https://openalex.org/W1974074767,"The Ahb/Ahb homozygous and the Ahb/Ahd heterozygous inbred mouse strains from the (C57BL/6)(DBA/2)F1 X DBA/2 backcross are genetically responsive to 3-methylcholanthrene. They both also develop, within 6 hours after a large intraperitoneal dose of acetaminophen, an irreversible opacity in the anterior portion of the lens. Such cataract formation does not occur in similarly treated nonresponsive inbred strains or nonresponsive Ahd/Ahd individuals from the same backcross. Differences in acetaminophen metabolism and toxicity are associated with the Ah locus in the mouse, and differences in heritability at the Ah locus exist in the human. Our ophthalmologic findings may be important clinically to certain patients receiving either a single large overdose of this drug or high doses over a long period."
https://openalex.org/W1595218111,"Hepatic submitochondrial particles, prepared at neutral pH from rats pretreated with glucagon, exhibited stimulated rates of State 3 and uncoupled respiration when succinate or NADH were the substrates, but not when ascorbate plus N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine were employed. Measurements of 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid fluorescence in the particles indicated that glucagon treatment resulted in a stimulation of energization supported by succinate respiration or ATP hydrolysis. Similarly, the energy-linked pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase and reverse electron flow reactions driven by succinate oxidation or ATP were also stimulated. The results indicate that mitochondrial substrate transport is not the prime locus of glucagon action. It is suggested that the increased level of energization in particles prepared from glucagon-treated rats is a reflection of a stimulation of the respiratory chain, possibly between cytochromes b and c, and the ATP-forming reactions."

https://openalex.org/W166162217,"The endoplasmic reticulum of adipocytes possess an ATPdependent calcium uptake system (Bruns, I). E., McDonald, J. M., and Jarett, L. (1976) J. Bid. Chem. 251, 7191-7197) which is shown in this report to be regulated by insulin treatment of intact adipocytes. Insulin (100 microunitslml) treatment of cells resulted in a 20% (p < 0.025 to 0.001 at various time points) increase in the steady state calcium filling capacity of endoplasmic reticulum. This insulin effect was specific as determined by the insulin-concentration dependency between 5 and 100 microunits of insulin/ml and by the lack of effect by desoctapeptide insulin. This increase resulted from a 28% (p < 0.025) increase in the apparent V,,,,, of calcium uptake. Insulin treatment had no affect on the K,,, (1.4 PM) of the reaction nor on the rate of calcium efflux from the vesicles when efflux was initiated by either ethylene glycol bis(/3-aminoethyl ether)N,N’-tetraacetic acid or the calcium ionophore A23187. Consistent with these changes, insulin treatment of cells resulted in a 33% (p < 0.001) increase in the atomic absorption measurements of the total calcium content of the microsomal fraction. The total calcium content of the microsomal fraction consisted of a highly stable pool and a less stable or labile pool. Only the labile pool was altered by insulin treatment, and the insulin-induced change represented a 50% increase of this pool. Insulin treatment had no effect on the magnesium content of the microsomal fraction. These findings support the concept that the calcium uptake system of the endoplasmic reticulum of adipocytes is likely to be physiologically important. Furthermore insulin regulation of intracellular calcium pools probably plays an essential role in the mechanism of insulin action."
https://openalex.org/W1525267195,"The affinity of a substituted nitrosobenzene for ferrohemoglobin and the visible absorption spectrum of the resulting compound was influenced by the nature, position, and number of substituents on its benzene ring. Alkyl ring substituents inhibited the binding of nitrosobenzene to ferrohemoglobin, and binding was blocked by an ortho tertbutyl group or by a pair of ortho methyl groups. A single halogen atom increased binding affinity except that iodine decreased affinity, more at the ortho than at the para position. Binding occurred with a pair of ortho fluorine atoms but not with a pair of ortho chlorine or bromine atoms. These results favor a model of nitrosoarene ferrohemoglobin in which the iron of ferroheme is bonded to the nitrogen atom of the nitroso group since a bond to the oxygen atom would not be hindered by ortho substituents. The presence of a carboxylate substituent resulted in prevention of binding, which was reversed by esterification of the group. Large neutral para substituents, which cannot directly affect formation of the Fe-NO bond, inhibited binding, although not to the same degree as ortho substituents. It thus appears that the affinity of a substituted nitrosobenzene for ferrohemoglobin depends on interactions of the nonbonding part of the ligand molecule with the heme crevice as well as on the ability of its nitroso group to form a bond with the iron of heme. Nitrosoarenes also exhibited in varying degrees the property of removing an electron from ferrohemoglobin to form ferrihemoglobin."

At concentrations up to 200 micrograms per milliliter, rifampicin does not alter rat thymic transcription. Rifampicin causes a direct inhibition of protein synthesis in rat thymic and hepatic microsomes, and in cadaveric human hepatic microsomes. Protein synthesis inhibition could explain the toxicity of rifampicin in man."

https://openalex.org/W1574274474,"Abstract It has been recently demonstrated that some nitrosyl hemoglobin derivatives have different optical spectrum according to the nature of their quaternary structure (Cassoly, R. (1974) C. R. Seances Acad. Sci., Paris 278, 1417-1420; Salhany, J. M., Ogawa, S., and Shulman, R. G. (1974) Proc. Natl, Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 71, 3359-3362; Cassoly, R. (1975) J. Mol. Biol. 98, 581-595). This property has been used in order to detect the presence of asymmetrical hybrids alphaNObetaNOalpha'O2beta'O2 in a mixture of the two hemoglobins alpha2NObeta2NO and alpha2'O2beta2'O2. When one changes, by deoxygenation, the conformation of the hybrid, there is a characteristic modification in the optical spectrum of the nitrosyl subunits. Quantitative analysis of this phenomenon shows that asymmetrical alphaNObetaNOalphadeoxybetadeoxy and symmetrical alpha2NObeta2deoxy hybrids have distinct properties. The structure-linked optical transition is different in rate and amplitude; it is faster and larger for the asymmetrical molecule. Carbon monoxide binding kinetics performed in absence of phosphate have also indicated that the allosteric equilibrium is more displaced in favor of the T state for alphaNObetaNOalphadeoxybetadeoxy by comparison with the symmetrical deoxygenated intermediates."

https://openalex.org/W2036625460,"In spite of remarkable advances in medical therapy and in the development of fantastic diagnostic devices, American society appears increasingly disenchanted with the physician. The paradox can be explained by the high cost of medical care, the overselling of medicine's capabilities, the expectation that the physician will be both ultrascientific and as emphathic as yesterday's doctor, and little recognition that the curing of one illness in the elderly exposes this group to other disease. Finally, though the physician is trained to manage illnesses, he is also given the excessively broad task of improving personal and societal practices disadvantageous to health."
https://openalex.org/W2133036091,"SUMMARY The relationship between ATP and energy charge was studied in individuals of Cirolana borealis under heavy metabolic stress caused by anoxia or exposure to toluene. Prolonged anoxia led to a lowering of the ATP content to about 10% after 4 days, with a simultaneous decrease in energy charge to about 0.25. A lowering of the total adenylate pool reduced the fall in energy charge somewhat, but this effect was marked only in late anoxia when the individuals had become inactive. Exposure to 0.14 mM toluene for 8 days led to a similar decrease in ATP and energy charge. Exposure to 1.4 mM toluene for 24 h led to only slight changes in the adenine nucleotide pool, although the individuals became narcotized within a few hours. The energy charge associated with moribund individuals thus varied much. The mechanism of energy charge stabilization through reduction of the adenine nucleotide pool as ATP declined seemed to be of little significance for the survival of the individuals."
https://openalex.org/W1586281080,"An endodeoxyribonuclease has been purified 750-fold from human KB cells. The purified endonuclease requires Mg2+ for maximum activity: Mn2+ was less than half as active and Ca2+ inhibited the reaction. The optimum pH is 8.8 in Tris-HCl and the optimum buffer concentration is 10 mM. KCl (and NaCl), --SH-reacting reagents, and tRNA strongly inhibit the reaction. An apparent molecular weight of 54,000 was determined by sedimentation in a glycerol gradient. The purified endonuclease cleaved native, double-stranded adenovirus 2 DNA, and the reaction proceeded stepwise during the initial stage of degradation by cleavage of the DNA substrate in half, then in half again, etc. At longer digestion times, single strand scissions were detected. RNA was not a substrate for the enzyme. Poly(dG) . poly(dC) was susceptible but poly(dA) . poly(dT) was resistant to degradation. Hydrolysis of adenovirus 2 DNA yielded double-stranded polynucleotides containing 5'-phosphoryl and 3'-hydroxyl termini with short, single-stranded regions presumably at the ends. More than 50% of the product of a limit digest had a chain length greater than 35 to 40 nucleotides. Analysis of the 5' and 3' end groups of the digestion products indicated a preference for the site of the enzymatic cleavage; thymidylic acid residues were present at the 5' end and deoxyguanosine residues at the 3' end, each with a frequency of 40 to 50%."
https://openalex.org/W2042481434,The unmet needs of many patients make the successful search for new and better drugs an urgent goal. Increasing regulatory demands have generated delays in the availability of new drugs and concerns about the long-term profitability of the innovative pharmaceutical industry. A rational and flexible approach to drug regulation could ease some of the most worrisome constraints without jeopardizing the public welfare. Changes in our national drug regulatory policy and in the performance of the Food and Drug Administration will serve our society better than drastic legislative mandates intended either to emasculate the FDA or to grant the agency broad new powers.
