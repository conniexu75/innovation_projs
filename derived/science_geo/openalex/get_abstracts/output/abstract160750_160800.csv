https://openalex.org/W2127311839,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is an inherited neurodevelopmental disorder of females that occurs once in 10,000-15,000 births. Affected females develop normally for 6-18 months, but then lose voluntary movements, including speech and hand skills. Most RTT patients are heterozygous for mutations in the X-linked gene MECP2 (refs. 3-12), encoding a protein that binds to methylated sites in genomic DNA and facilitates gene silencing. Previous work with Mecp2-null embryonic stem cells indicated that MeCP2 is essential for mouse embryogenesis. Here we generate mice lacking Mecp2 using Cre-loxP technology. Both Mecp2-null mice and mice in which Mecp2 was deleted in brain showed severe neurological symptoms at approximately six weeks of age. Compensation for absence of MeCP2 in other tissues by MeCP1 (refs. 19,20) was not apparent in genetic or biochemical tests. After several months, heterozygous female mice also showed behavioral symptoms. The overlapping delay before symptom onset in humans and mice, despite their profoundly different rates of development, raises the possibility that stability of brain function, not brain development per se, is compromised by the absence of MeCP2."

https://openalex.org/W1971812548,"The discovery of superconductivity at 39 K in magnesium diboride, MgB2, raises many issues, a critical one being whether this material resembles a high-temperature copper oxide superconductor or a low-temperature metallic superconductor in terms of its behaviour in strong magnetic fields. Although the copper oxides exhibit very high transition temperatures, their in-field performance is compromized by their large anisotropy, the result of which is to restrict high bulk current densities to a region much less than the full magnetic-field-temperature (H-T) space over which superconductivity is found. Moreover, the weak coupling across grain boundaries makes transport current densities in untextured polycrystalline samples low and strongly sensitive to magnetic field. Here we report that, despite the multiphase, untextured, microscale, subdivided nature of our MgB2 samples, supercurrents flow throughout the material without exhibiting strong sensitivity to weak magnetic fields. Our combined magnetization, magneto-optical, microscopy and X-ray investigations show that the supercurrent density is mostly determined by flux pinning, rather than by the grain boundary connectivity. Our results therefore suggest that this new superconductor class is not compromized by weak-link problems, a conclusion of significance for practical applications if higher temperature analogues of this compound can be discovered."

https://openalex.org/W2146355396,"Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is an unusual tumor with highly characteristic histopathology and ultrastructure, controversial histogenesis, and enigmatic clinical behavior. Recent cytogenetic studies have identified a recurrent der(17) due to a non-reciprocal t(X;17)(p11.2;q25) in this sarcoma. To define the interval containing the Xp11.2 break, we first performed FISH on ASPS cases using YAC probes for OATL1 (Xp11.23) and OATL2 (Xp11.21), and cosmid probes from the intervening genomic region. This localized the breakpoint to a 160 kb interval. The prime candidate within this previously fully sequenced region was TFE3, a transcription factor gene known to be fused to translocation partners on 1 and X in some papillary renal cell carcinomas. Southern blotting using a TFE3 genomic probe identified non-germline bands in several ASPS cases, consistent with rearrangement and possible fusion of TFE3 with a gene on 17q25. Amplification of the 5' portion of cDNAs containing the 3' portion of TFE3 in two different ASPS cases identified a novel sequence, designated ASPL, fused in-frame to TFE3 exon 4 (type 1 fusion) or exon 3 (type 2 fusion). Reverse transcriptase PCR using a forward primer from ASPL and a TFE3 exon 4 reverse primer detected an ASPL-TFE3 fusion transcript in all ASPS cases (12/12: 9 type 1, 3 type 2), establishing the utility of this assay in the diagnosis of ASPS. Using appropriate primers, the reciprocal fusion transcript, TFE3-ASPL, was detected in only one of 12 cases, consistent with the non-reciprocal nature of the translocation in most cases, and supporting ASPL-TFE3 as its oncogenically significant fusion product. ASPL maps to chromosome 17, is ubiquitously expressed, and matches numerous ESTs (Unigene cluster Hs.84128) but no named genes. The ASPL cDNA open reading frame encodes a predicted protein of 476 amino acids that contains within its carboxy-terminal portion of a UBX-like domain that shows significant similarity to predicted proteins of unknown function in several model organisms. The ASPL-TFE3 fusion replaces the N-terminal portion of TFE3 by the fused ASPL sequences, while retaining the TFE3 DNA-binding domain, implicating transcriptional deregulation in the pathogenesis of this tumor, consistent with the biology of several other translocation-associated sarcomas.

https://openalex.org/W2081825921,"The low concentrations of niobium, tantalum and titanium observed in island-arc basalts are thought to result from modification of the sub-arc mantle by a metasomatic agent, deficient in these elements, that originates from within the subducted oceanic crust. Whether this agent is an hydrous fluid or a silica-rich melt has been discussed using mainly a trace-element approach and related to variable thermal regimes of subduction zones. Melting of basalt in the absence of fluid both requires high temperatures and yields melt compositions unlike those found in most modern or Mesozoic island arcs. Thus, metasomatism by fluids has been thought to be the most common situation. Here, however, we show that the melting of basalt under both H2O-added and low-temperature conditions can yield extremely alkali-rich silicic liquids, the alkali content of which increases with pressure. These liquids are deficient in titanium and in the elements niobium and tantalum and are virtually identical to glasses preserved in mantle xenoliths found in subduction zones and to veins found in exhumed metamorphic terranes of fossil convergent zones. We also found that the interaction between such liquids and mantle olivine produces modal mineralogies that are identical to those observed in metasomatized Alpine-type peridotites. We therefore suggest that mantle metasomatism by slab-derived melt is a more common process than previously thought."

https://openalex.org/W2057324469,"The self-incompatibility response in Brassica allows recognition and rejection of self-pollen by the stigmatic papillae. The transmembrane S-locus receptor kinase (SRK), a member of the receptor-like kinase superfamily in plants, mediates recognition of self-pollen on the female side1, whereas the S-locus cysteine-rich protein (SCR) is the male component of the self-incompatibility response2. SCR is presumably located in the pollen coat, and is thought to be the SRK ligand2,3. Although many receptor-like kinases have been isolated in plants, the mechanisms of signal transduction mediated by these molecules remain largely unknown. Here we show that SRK is phosphorylated in vivo within one hour of self-pollination. We also show that, in vitro, autophosphorylation of SRK is prevented by the stigma thioredoxin THL1 in the absence of a ligand. This inhibition is released in a haplotype-specific manner by the addition of pollen coat proteins. Our data indicate that SRK is inhibited by thioredoxins and activated by pollen coat proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2024682444,"The BRCA1 gene was previously found to inhibit the transcriptional activity of the estrogen receptor [ER-alpha] in human breast and prostate cancer cell lines. In this study, we found that breast cancer-associated mutations of BRCA1 abolish or reduce its ability to inhibit ER-alpha activity and that domains within the amino- and carboxyl-termini of the BRCA1 protein are required for the inhibition. BRCA1 inhibition of ER-alpha activity was demonstrated under conditions in which a BRCA1 transgene was transiently or stably over-expressed in cell lines with endogenous wild-type BRCA1 and in a breast cancer cell line that lacks endogenous functional BRCA1 (HCC1937). In addition, BRCA1 blocked the expression of two endogenous estrogen-regulated gene products in human breast cancer cells: pS2 and cathepsin D. The BRCA1 protein was found to associate with ER-alpha in vivo and to bind to ER-alpha in vitro, by an estrogen-independent interaction that mapped to the amino-terminal region of BRCA1 (ca. amino acid 1-300) and the conserved carboxyl-terminal activation function [AF-2] domain of ER-alpha. Furthermore, several truncated BRCA1 proteins containing the amino-terminal ER-alpha binding region blocked the ability of the full-length BRCA1 protein to inhibit ER-alpha activity. Our findings suggest that the amino-terminus of BRCA1 interacts with ER-alpha, while the carboxyl-terminus of BRCA1 may function as a transcriptional repression domain. Oncogene (2001) 20, 77 - 87."
https://openalex.org/W2325413783,"Loss of functional adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein results in the stabilization of cytosolic beta-catenin and activation of genes that are responsive to Lef/Tcf family transcription factors. We have recently shown that an independent cell adhesion and integrin linked kinase (ILK)-dependent pathway can also activate beta-catenin/LEF mediated gene transcription and downregulate E-cadherin expression. In addition, ILK activity and expression are elevated in adenomatous polyposis and colon carcinomas. To examine the role of this pathway in the background of APC mutations we inhibited ILK activity in APC-/- human colon carcinoma cell lines. In all cases, inhibition of ILK resulted in substantial inhibition of TCF mediated gene transcription and inhibition of transcription and expression of the TCF regulated gene, cyclin D1. Inhibition of ILK resulted in decreased nuclear beta-catenin expression, and in the inhibition of phosphorylation of GSK-3 and stimulation of its activity, leading to accelerated degradation of beta-catenin. In addition, inhibition of ILK suppressed cell growth in culture as well as growth of human colon carcinoma cells in SCID mice. Strikingly, inhibition of ILK also resulted in the transcriptional stimulation of E-cadherin expression and correlated with the inhibition of gene transcription of snail, a repressor of E-cadherin gene expression. Overexpression of ILK caused a stimulation of expression of snail, but snail expression was found not to be regulated by beta-catenin/Tcf. These data demonstrate that ILK can regulate beta-catenin/TCF and snail transcription factors by distinct pathways. We propose that inhibition of ILK may be a useful strategy in the control of progression of colon as well as other carcinomas. Oncogene (2001) 20, 133 - 140."

To address whether BK channel alternative splice variants are differentially regulated by PKA-mediated protein phosphorylation, we have examined the regulation of three mouse (mslo) BK channel variants (20Butler A.

We have thus assayed the functional regulation of BK channel splice variants by directly activating PKA that remains closely associated with the channels in excised inside-out patches. cDNAs encoding mouse BK channel variants were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 or pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen BV, Leek, The Netherlands) and transfected into HEK293 cells using lipofectAMINE as previously described (22Shipston M.J. Duncan R.R. Clark A.G. Antoni F.A. Tian L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1728-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The cloning and subcloning of the three splice variants have been described previously (ZERO and STREX-1 (22Shipston M.J. Duncan R.R. Clark A.G. Antoni F.A. Tian L.J. Mol.

ZERO lacks inserts at mammalian splice sites 1–5 and STREX-1 channels are identical except for a 59-amino acid cysteine-rich insert at mammalian splice site 2. ZERO1/4ΔC contains inserts at splice sites 1 and 4 and has modified N and C termini compared with ZERO constructs. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing. Site-directed mutants displayed no significant change in single channel kinetics or conductance, although S869A channels displayed a significant shift in V 0.5 (10–12 mV in the absence of intracellular ATP) compared with wild type ZERO channels. GST fusion proteins of the STREX-1 splice insert were constructed in pGEX-5x-1 by polymerase chain reaction and recombinant protein purified and assayed in a PKA phosphorylation reaction under standard conditions. Coimmunoprecipitation of channel variants with the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKAc) was performed essentially as described previously (24Wang J. Zhou Y. Wen H. Levitan I. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19 (1–7): RC4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in the inside-out configuration of the patch clamp technique at room temperature (20–24 °C) using physiological potassium gradients essentially as described previously (22Shipston M.J. Duncan R.R. Clark A.G. Antoni F.A. Tian L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1728-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The pipette solution (extracellular) contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 0.1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 20 glucose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. The bath solution (intracellular) contained (in mm): 140 KCl, 5 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 1 or 5 BAPTA, 30 glucose, 10 HEPES, 1 mm ATP, pH 7.3, with free calcium [Ca2+]i buffered to 0.2 μm, unless indicated otherwise. Data acquisition and voltage protocols were controlled by an Axopatch 200 A or B amplifier and pCLAMP6 software (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). All recordings were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. Following patch excision channel activity was allowed to stabilize for at least 10 min (typically 10–15 min after excision) before application of cAMP or other reagents to the intracellular face of patches by gravity-driven perfusion or direct application to the bath. In all experiments 1 mm cAMP was used to activate endogenous PKA, similar results were also observed using 0.1 mm cAMP (not shown). Patches were held at 0 mV, and channel activity was determined during voltage steps to +40 mV. To determine mean percent change in channel activity after a treatment, in patches with low to moderate levels of channel expression, meanNP o (number of functional channels × open probability of channel) was averaged from 60 s of recording at +40 mV immediately before and 10 min after the respective drug treatment. Mean change in activity was expressed as a percentage of the pretreatment control ± S.E. with analysis undertaken using pCLAMP6 and IGOR Pro3.1 (Wavemetrics). In the respective figure legends and text a positive percentage change in activity reflects activation, whereas a negative percentage change reflects channel inhibition. Statistical significance was defined at p < 0.05 using nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis or Mann-Whiney U test as appropriate.

The mean percentage activation in response to cAMP was 128.6 ± 45.2%. cAMP-mediated inhibition of channel activity was never observed in patches containing ZERO channels. This activation was dependent upon closely associated cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity as cAMP had no effect in any patch in the absence of ATP (mean percent change in activity was: 2.9 ± 15.6%,n = 4) or in the presence of the specific PKA inhibitor peptide PKI5–24 (−9.3 ± 8.2%, n = 6).

The inhibitory effect of cAMP was not a result of the enhanced single channel P o observed in STREX-1 compared with ZERO channels under identical recording conditions as cAMP also inhibited STREX-1 channels when recording conditions were adjusted to give a P o similar to that of ZERO (not shown). The data suggest that an endogenous cAMP-dependent protein kinase A activity (PKA) remains closely associated with STREX-1 or ZERO channels in excised patches from HEK293 cells. Indeed, the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKAc) binds directly to the C-terminal tail of dSlo (24Wang J. Zhou Y. Wen H. Levitan I. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19 (1–7): RC4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and coimmunoprecipitates with both mouse ZERO and STREX-1 channel splice variants expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig.2 a). This interaction is specific as PKAc did not coimmunoprecipitate with KCNQ3 potassium channel subunits under the same conditions. 2H. Wen and I. B. Levitan, unpublished data. It is interesting that, in the case of one splice variant of dSlo, PKA regulatory subunit competes with the channel for PKAc binding, and hence the holoenzyme does not bind to the channel. 3Y. Zhou and I. B. Levitan, unpublished data. In contrast to the robust regulation of ZERO or STREX-1 channels, cAMP had no significant effect on channels containing inserts at splice sites 1 and 4 with different N and C termini (Fig. 1 c; ZERO1/4ΔC variant (21Pallanck L. Ganetzky B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1239-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), mean percent change in activity was 7.8 ± 5.2%, n = 8). As PKAc also coimmunoprecipitates with the ZERO1/4ΔC variant, the lack of regulation by cAMP is unlikely to be a result of the inability of PKAc to interact with this variant. Thus, the functional effect of PKA-mediated phosphorylation on BK channel activity is determined by alternative exon splicing of the BK channel pore-forming subunit. The differential regulation of the ZERO and STREX-1 splice variants may result from (i) the STREX-1 exon modifying the functional effect of PKA protein phosphorylation at conserved sites within the α-subunit or, alternatively, (ii) the STREX-1 exon itself introducing additional PKA consensus motifs. To address these issues we undertook site-directed mutagenesis of putative conserved C-terminal and STREX-1 insert-specific PKA consensus motifs (Fig. 1 a). Although mammalian BK channel α-subunits do not contain strong PKA consensus sites, sequence analysis reveals more than 10 putative weaker PKA sites in the C terminus (20Butler A. Tsunoda S. McCobb D.P. Wei A. Salkoff L. Science. 1993; 261: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 27Nara M. Dhulipala P.D. Wang Y.X. Kotlikoff M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14920-14924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The conserved mammalian C-terminal serine residue at position 869 (Ser869) has been reported as the target for PKA-mediated activation of the hSlo ZERO variant expressed in Xenopus oocytes (27Nara M. Dhulipala P.D. Wang Y.X. Kotlikoff M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14920-14924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the equivalent site in dSlo (Ser942) is phosphorylated by PKA (24Wang J. Zhou Y. Wen H. Levitan I. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19 (1–7): RC4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of serine 869 to alanine (S869A) completely abolished cAMP-mediated activation of the ZERO variant (S869A construct, mean percent change activity was 3.2 ± 1.5%, n = 8) but had no significant effect on cAMP-mediated inhibition of the site-directed STREX-1 variant (STREX-S869A, mean percent change was −58.1 ± 12.1%, n = 11) in excised patches (Fig.3, a and b). Importantly, the inhibitory effect of cAMP on STREX-S869A channels is dependent upon endogenous PKA activity as cAMP had no effect on the activity of STREX-S869A channels in the absence of ATP (n = 5, not shown) or in the presence of PKI5–24 (n = 6, Fig. 3 b). Thus the effect of cAMP in the STREX-S869A variant is specific to activation of endogenous cAMP-dependent protein kinase and not a result of nonspecific actions or activation of protein kinase G under the recording conditions used. These data suggest that Ser869 is essential for PKA-mediated activation of the ZERO variant but is not required for PKA-mediated inhibition of STREX-1. This implies that the presence of the STREX-1 exon per sedoes not modify the functional effect of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Ser869. The presence of the STREX-1 exon may expose or introduce additional protein kinase A consensus sites within the α-subunit. To address whether the STREX-1 exon is itself a target for PKA phosphorylation, we analyzed whether a STREX-1 insert GST fusion protein is a substrate for PKA-dependent phosphorylationin vitro. Sequence analysis of mammalian STREX-1 exons reveals putative weak PKA consensus sites with serine residue 4 (S4 STREX, Fig. 1 a) conserved in all mammalian STREX-1 inserts identified to date (22Shipston M.J. Duncan R.R. Clark A.G. Antoni F.A. Tian L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1728-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Saito M. Nelson C. Salkoff L. Lingle C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11710-11717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). PKA phosphorylates a GST-STREX-1 fusion protein in vitro (Fig.2 b), and this phosphorylation is completely eliminated when S4STREX is mutated to alanine (GST-S4 STREX A; Fig. 2 b). We thus addressed whether S4STREX plays a functional role in mediating PKA inhibition of STREX-1 using the full-length site-directed S4STREXA mutant expressed in HEK293 cells. In contrast to the robust cAMP-mediated inhibition of channel activity observed with the STREX-1 or STREX-S869A channels cAMP-mediated protein phosphorylation resulted in significant stimulation (mean percent increase in activity was 45.8 ± 5.9%, n = 7) of the S4STREXA site-directed mutant (Fig. 3, a andb). This suggests that S4STREX plays a dominant inhibitory role in the regulation of BK channels expressing the STREX-1 exon as the activation of S4STREXA channels dependent upon the conserved C-terminal Ser869 site is overridden in the presence of a functional S4STREX site. cAMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated regulation was abolished when both the conserved C-terminal Ser869 and exon-specific S4STREX serine residues were mutated to alanine (double mutant, S4 STREX A-S869A, percent change was 6.5 ± 6.8%, n = 8, Fig.3 b). Several mechanisms contribute to the diversity and plasticity of the properties and regulation of potassium ion channels, including multiple gene families, heteromultimerization of subunits, association with regulatory or accessory subunits, and post-translational modifications such as reversible protein phosphorylation. As BK channels are derived from a single gene alternative, exon splicing plays a major role in determining the functional diversity of BK channels. Our data reveal that alternative exon splicing of BK channels also provides a fundamental context-sensitive mechanism for switching BK channel sensitivity to protein phosphorylation that has significant implications for both the long and short term control of cellular excitability. As BK channel splice variant expression can be dynamically regulated, for example during stress or pregnancy (15Xie J. McCobb D.P. Science. 1998; 280: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 16Benkusky N. Fergus D. Zucchero T. England S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27712-27719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the functional consequence of PKA-mediated regulation of BK channel activity may be switched in the long term by altering the splice variant expressed (e.g. from ZERO to STREX-1). In contrast, short term switching of BK channel sensitivity to PKA could be achieved by specific dephosphorylation of residues important for PKA regulation within a splice insert. For example, in STREX-1 containing channels that are normally inhibited by PKA, dephosphorylation of the PKA site specifically within the STREX-1 insert would allow PKA-dependent activation of the channel through conserved sites in the C terminus (as for S4STREXA construct). Further diversity and plasticity may be achieved through splice variant heteromultimerization and/or association with regulatory subunits (17Dworetzky S. Boissard C. Lum-ragan J. McKay M.

In conclusion, alternative exon splicing acts as a powerful long and short term molecular switch to define the sensitivity of BK channels to protein phosphorylation and provides a fundamental mechanism for specifying the diversity, plasticity, and functional role of such modular coincidence detectors of excitable cells.

https://openalex.org/W1965060083,"Mutations in theclk-1 gene of Caenorhabditis elegans result in an extended life span and an average slowing down of developmental and behavioral rates. However, it has not been possible to identify biochemical changes that might underlie the extension of life span observed in clk-1 mutants, and therefore the function of CLK-1 in C. elegans remains unknown. In this report, we analyzed the effect of clk-1 mutation on ubiquinone (UQ9) biosynthesis and show that clk-1 mutants mitochondria do not contain detectable levels of UQ9. Instead, the UQ9 biosynthesis intermediate, demethoxyubiquinone (DMQ9), is present at high levels. This result demonstrates that CLK-1 is absolutely required for the biosynthesis of UQ9 in C. elegans. Interestingly, the activity levels of NADH-cytochrome creductase and succinate-cytochrome c reductase in mutant mitochondria are very similar to those in the wild-type, suggesting that DMQ9 can function as an electron carrier in the respiratory chain. To test this possibility, the short side chain derivative DMQ2 was chemically synthesized. We find that DMQ2 can act as an electron acceptor for both complex I and complex II in clk-1 mutant mitochondria, while another ubiquinone biosynthesis precursor, 3-hydroxy-UQ2, cannot. The accumulation of DMQ9 and its use in mutant mitochondria indicate, for the first time in any organism, a link between the alteration in the quinone species used in respiration and life span."

Two receptors, TrkA and p75, participate in the formation of the high affinity NGF binding site (2Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Kong H. Chao M.V. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). TrkA enhances both NGF responsiveness and cell survival (3Kaplan D.R. Prog.

Furthermore, mice deficient in IKK, the enzyme that phosphorylates and targets the inhibitory molecule IκB leading to NF−κB activation, leads to a defect in neureulation (10Li Q. Estepa G. Memet S. Israel A. Verma I.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1729-1733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, TRAF6-deficient mice also display a failure of neural tube closure and exencephaly (11Lomaga M.A. Henderson J.T. Elia A.J. Robertson J. Noyce R.S. Yeh W.C. Mak T.W. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7384-7393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of NF−κB in the nervous system. The activation of IKK and NF-κB has been shown to require atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) in both neuronal and non-neuronal systems (reviewed in Ref. 12Wooten M.W. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, aPKC over-expression enhances NGF prosurvival signaling through up-regulation of NF-κB (13Wooten M.W. Seibenhener M.L. Zhou G. Vandenplas M.L. Tan T.H. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 753-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast, proapoptotic signaling inhibits aPKC and blocks NF-κB (14Wang Y. Seibenhener M.L. Vandenplas M.L. Wooten M.W. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 55: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Additionally, the selective aPKC-binding protein, p62 (15Puls A.

Here we report that p62 plays a novel role as a scaffold for the activation of NF-κB by nerve growth factor, linking both p75 and TrkA receptor components. Cultures of human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) or NIH-3T3 cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Subconfluent cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method. PC12 cells were grown on cultureware coated with rat tail collagen in RPMI containing 10% horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 50 mg/ml streptomycin). PC12 or NIH-3T3 cells were routinely transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.). 2.5 S NGF was purchased from Bioproducts for Science (Indianapolis, IN). The monoclonal 12CA5 anti-HA and anti-Flag antibodies were from Sigma. The rabbit anti-Myc, anti-TRAF6, anti-TrkA, and anti-IKK antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The monoclonal anti-p62 was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories. To detect endogenous proteins in PC12 cells or those cotransfected into HEK cells, lysates were prepared from subconfluent cultures of cells grown on 100-mm dishes. Typically cells were transfected for 36–42 h with 5–10 μg of construct and pcDNA3 plasmid to give 30 μg of total DNA. After transfection, cells were stimulated or not with 50 ng/ml NGF. Cells were then harvested and lysed in PD buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 6 mm EDTA, 6 mm EGTA, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm phenyl phosphate, 300 μm Na3V04, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Extracts were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Protein was determined, and equal amounts of whole-cell lysate were diluted in PD buffer and incubated with antibody as indicated for 2 h. Then protein A or G beads were added for an additional hour at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were then washed five times with PD buffer. As control an aliquot of the cell lysate (1/10) volume was also analyzed by immunoblotting. Samples were fractionated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to Western blot analysis with the corresponding antibodies. Proteins were detected with ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). NF-κB activation was measured using a reporter gene assay. HEK, 3T3, or PC12 cells were transfected with a κB-luciferase reporter gene plasmid, 3EconA-Luc (17Sanz L. Diaz-Meco M.T. Nakano H. Moscat J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1576-1586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 24 or 48 h, the cells were stimulated with NGF and activity determined using a Promega luciferase assay kit. Individual constructs were transfected in duplicate and each assay measured in triplicate. Values are reported as the mean ± S.E. of three individual experiments. Because aPKC is critically involved in the NGF prosurvival signaling pathway (13Wooten M.W. Seibenhener M.L. Zhou G. Vandenplas M.L. Tan T.H. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 753-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Wooten M.W. Seibenhener M.L. Neidigh K.B. Vandenplas M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4494-4504Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we decided to investigate whether neurotrophin binding would stimulate the formation of a complex between NGF receptor components, TrkA and p75, and p62. PC12 cell lysates were prepared from NGF-treated cells followed by pull-down assays (19Yamashita T. Tucker K.L. Barde Y.A. Neuron. 2000; 24: 585-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (445) Google Scholar) employing GST-TrkA or GST-p75 (Fig.1 A). p62 associated with TrkA but not with p75. To confirm this finding in a more in vivosetting, p62 was coexpressed with either TrkA or p75 in HEK cells (17Sanz L. Diaz-Meco M.T. Nakano H. Moscat J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1576-1586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the coprecipitation of p62 with either receptor was examined. The results, shown in Fig. 1 B, confirmed that p62 selectively associates with TrkA but not with p75. As in this experiment both TrkA and p62 were over-expressed, their interaction took place even in the absence of any stimulus. To demonstrate that endogenous p62 and TrkA interact in vivo and that this interaction may be induced in response to NGF, PC12 cells were stimulated with NGF for different times after which the coprecipitation of endogenous p62 with TrkA was examined. The results shown in Fig. 1 C demonstrate that there is a significant portion of p62 bound to TrkA under basal conditions but that this interaction was reproducibly enhanced in the NGF-treated cells (Fig. 1 C), indicating that this is an NGF-regulated process. To establish which region of p62 is required for interaction with TrkA, deletion mutants of p62 were transfected into HEK cells along with HA-tagged TrkA, and their association was determined by immunoprecipitation as above (17Sanz L. Diaz-Meco M.T. Nakano H. Moscat J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1576-1586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The region encompassing amino acids 266–446 of p62 binds TrkA, whereas the binding of p62 to TRAF6 has been mapped to amino acids 225–251 (Ref.17Sanz L. Diaz-Meco M.T. Nakano H. Moscat J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1576-1586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and Table I). This indicates that p62 may accommodate both TrkA and TRAF6 simultaneously. Deletion of the TRAF6 binding site did not effect TrkA binding to p62, thus further strengthening the notion that p62 interacts with TrkA and TRAF6 through two independent binding domains (Table I).Table IMapping of p62-TrkA interaction domainsMyc-tagged p62 constructs were prepared as described previously (17Sanz L.

For comparison, the binding of p62 to TrkA was mapped relative to aPKC and TRAF6 (17Sanz L. Diaz-Meco M.T. Nakano H. Moscat J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1576-1586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

AID, acidic sequence and atypical PKC interacting domain; ZZ, zinc-finger domain. TRAF6 has been reported to interact with p75 (5Khursigara G. Orlinick J.R. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2597-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To determine whether TRAF6 interacts with TrkA as well, both p75 and TrkA were coexpressed in HEK cells along with Flag-TRAF6. Whereas p75 associated with TRAF6 in an NGF-dependent manner (Fig.2 A) as previously reported (5Khursigara G. Orlinick J.R. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2597-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), TRAF6 failed to associate directly with TrkA. The interaction of p75 with TRAF6 was mapped to the C-proximal TRAF-C domain, a region that also accommodates p62 (17Sanz L. Diaz-Meco M.T. Nakano H. Moscat J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1576-1586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coexpression experiments in HEK cells revealed that TRAF6 can bind both p75 and p62 simultaneously (not shown). Because p62 interacts with TRAF6 (17Sanz L. Diaz-Meco M.T. Nakano H. Moscat J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1576-1586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is conceivable that p62 may be brought into a p75 complex via TRAF6 serving as a bridge. If this model is correct we should be able to coimmunoprecipitate p62 with p75 only in the presence of TRAF6. The results shown in Fig.2 B strongly suggest that these predictions are correct. Thus, in HEK cells transfected with different expression vectors, a small amount of p75 was found to associate with p62, likely through endogenous TRAF6. Upon coexpression of TRAF6, recruitment of p75 into the p62 complex was significantly enhanced (∼2.5-fold). The ability of TrkA to coassociate with TRAF6 was dramatically and consistently enhanced by the presence of exogenous p62 (Fig.2 B). We next determined whether NGF could stimulate the formation of an endogenous TRAF6-p62 complex in PC12 cells (Fig.2 C). In the absence of NGF little or no association of TRAF6 with p62 or aPKC could be detected. However, the addition of NGF resulted in a rapid interaction of TRAF6 with p62 and consequently with aPKC. Close examination revealed that the kinetics of association between TRAF6 and p62 (maximum 1–5 min) occurs prior to the recruitment of p62 to the TrkA receptor (Fig. 1 C, peaks at 15 min), suggesting that it is a two-step process. Collectively, these results reveal that p62 interacts with TRAF6 in response to NGF and may likely serve as a bridge between both p75 and TrkA receptor components. As TRAF6 interaction with p75 results in activation of NF-κB (7Ye X. Mehlen P. Rabizadeh S. Van Arsdale T. Zhang H. Shin H. Wang J.J.L. Leo E. Zapata J. Hauser C.A. Reed J.C. Bredesen D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30202-30208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine whether the down-regulation of p62 with a p62 antisense construct (17Sanz L. Diaz-Meco M.T. Nakano H. Moscat J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1576-1586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) would block the induction of NF-κB as measured by a luciferase reporter system. The results shown in Fig.3 A demonstrate that this is the case, because there was a dramatic reduction of NF-κB activation by the expression of p75 and TRAF6 in cells transfected with the p62 antisense construct as compared with the nontransfected cells. On the other hand, the transfection of a p62 expression vector, that by itself does not activate NF-κB in this system (17Sanz L. Diaz-Meco M.T. Nakano H. Moscat J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1576-1586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), dramatically enhanced p75-TRAF6 or TrkA-TRAF6 activation of NF-κB (Fig.3 B). In contrast, p62/ZIP2, which lacks the TRAF6 binding site (16Sanchez P. Carcer G. Sandoval I.V. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3069-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), failed to activate NF-κB (Fig. 3 B). Altogether this indicates that the recruitment of p62 to the NGF receptor signaling complex is critical for the activation of NF-κB. Consistent with this notion, overexpression of p62 in PC12 cells resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of both basal as well as NGF-stimulated activation of NF-κB (Fig. 3 C). We next conducted experiments to investigate whether the antisense construct of p62 would block NGF-induced activation of NF-κB in cells expressing either one or both NGF receptors. Interestingly, antisense p62 blocked NGF-induced activation of NF-κB in PC12 cells expressing both receptors (Fig. 3 D). Likewise, p62 down-regulation in NIH-3T3 cells expressing either p75 or TrkA receptor (20Jiang H. Takeda K. Lazarovici P. Katagiri Y., Yu, Z. Dickens G. Chabuk A. Liu X. Ferrans V. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26209-26216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 D) also abrogated NGF-induced activation of NF-κB. Collectively these findings demonstrate that p62, like aPKC (13Wooten M.W. Seibenhener M.L. Zhou G. Vandenplas M.L. Tan T.H. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 753-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), is essential in the activation of NF-κB by NGF and that it serves to scaffold proximal NGF receptor components in this pathway. The functional relevance of the presence of p62 in these complexes was addressed further in the following series of experiments. Overexpression of p75 in HEK cells results in ligand-independent cell death that is prevented by TRAF6 (7Ye X. Mehlen P. Rabizadeh S. Van Arsdale T. Zhang H. Shin H. Wang J.J.L. Leo E. Zapata J.

Geleziunas R. Bradshaw R.A. Greene W.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7556-7563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the expression of antisense p62 enhanced p75 mediated-cell death (Fig.4 A), whereas expression of TRAF6 or p62 blocked cell death. The activation of NF-κB is likewise required for neuronal differentiation (9Feng Z. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30341-30344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and TrkA responsiveness (4Foehr E.D. Lin X. O'Mahony A. Geleziunas R. Bradshaw R.A. Greene W.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7556-7563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of antisense p62 significantly impaired NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, whereas overexpression of p62 enhanced NGF responsiveness (Fig. 4 A). The mechanism whereby p62 regulates activation of NF−κB likely involves recruitment of TRAF6 and aPKC onto the p62 scaffold, thus enabling aPKC-mediated phosphorylation of IKK (21Lallena M.J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Bren G. Paya C. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2180-2188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To provide evidence for the involvement of p62 in this process, we assessed the activity of endogenous IKK activity in an in vitro kinase assay using GST-Iκβα as the substrate (4Foehr E.D. Lin X. O'Mahony A. Geleziunas R. Bradshaw R.A. Greene W.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7556-7563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lallena M.J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Bren G. Paya C. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2180-2188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of antisense p62 suppressed NGF-stimulated activation of IKK (Fig. 4 B). The findings reported here provide new insight into the proximal components of the NGF/NF-κB pathway and demonstrate formation of a p62 bridge that scaffolds together both p75 and TrkA receptors for the activation of NF-κB (Fig. 4 C). Our results stress the role of p62 as a common and critical intermediary that channels different signaling pathways toward IKK activation. Understanding the mechanism whereby the TRAF6-p62 complex is regulated in vivois an area of ongoing study. Together, these findings underscore the importance of p62 as a scaffold for NF-κB and as a common platform for communication of both p75 and TrkA receptor signals.

Phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol at the D-4 position, an essential step in the biosynthesis of PIPs, appears to be catalyzed by two biochemically distinct enzymes. However, only one of these two enzymes has been molecularly characterized. We now describe a novel class of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases that probably corresponds to the missing element in phosphatidylinositol metabolism. These kinases are highly conserved evolutionarily, but unrelated to previously characterized phosphatidylinositol kinases, and thus represent the founding members of a new family. The novel phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases, which are widely expressed in cells, only phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol, are potently inhibited by adenosine, but are insensitive to wortmannin or phenylarsine oxide. Although they lack an obvious transmembrane domain, they are strongly attached to membranes by palmitoylation. Our data suggest that independent pathways for phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate synthesis emerged during evolution, possibly to allow tight temporal and spatial control over the production of this key signaling molecule.

Two classes of PtdIns 4-kinases, Types II and III, have been identified; the enzyme originally designated Type I was subsequently found to be a PtdIns 3-kinase (6Whitman M. Downes C.P. Keeler M. Keller T. Cantley L. Nature. 1988; 332: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Mammalian Type II PtdIns 4-kinase (henceforth referred to as PI4KII) is a 55-kDa integral membrane protein believed to account for most of the PtdIns 4-kinase activity in cells (7Tolias K.F. Cantley L.C. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It can be distinguished from the Type III kinases (PI4KIIIs) by virtue of its lower K m values for ATP and PtdIns, its insensitivity to inhibition by wortmannin, and its sensitivity to adenosine and monoclonal antibody 4C5G (8Endemann G.C. Graziani A. Cantley L.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The two closely related Type III kinases, IIIα and IIIβ, belong to the PtdIns 3/4-kinase superfamily, which also includes the protein kinases TOR/ATM/DNA-PK (9Gehrmann T. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. Eur.

Here we report the amino acid sequence of rat PI4KII and show that it represents a large family of putative lipid kinases highly conserved from yeast to humans, but bearing little similarity to other known lipid or protein kinases. Recombinant rat PI4KII has the enzymatic characteristics expected of the Type II kinases, and, despite lacking an obvious transmembrane domain, behaves as an integral membrane protein. This tight membrane association is due to palmitoylation within a cysteine-rich segment in the center of the protein.

All other reagents, including ATP, adenosine, phenylarsine oxide (PAO), wortmannin, and protease inhibitors were from Sigma. PI4KII was partially purified from membranes of bovine adrenal chromaffin granules (17Smith A.D. Winkler H. Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 480-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), obtained by floating lysed granules over a 1.2 m sucrose cushion. Membranes were washed in a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and a range of protease inhibitors: 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 mg/l each ofN a-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ester,N a-p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester, Na-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, leupeptin, and pepstatin A (buffer A) plus 0.5 m NaCl to remove loosely bound proteins, then solubilized in buffer A containing Triton X-100 (1:100 protein/detergent weight ratio). After centrifugation to remove insoluble material, the extract was diluted 5-fold with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (buffer B) and loaded on a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer B containing 1% Triton X-100 and 20 mm NaCl. The flow-through was directly loaded on an SP-Sepharose column and eluted with a linear 20–250 mm NaCl gradient. Fractions containing highest PtdIns 4-kinase activity were pooled and electrophoresed. PtdIns 4-kinase was identified by assaying renatured gel slices (13Walker D.H. Dougherty N. Pike L.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6504-6511Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The most active band was submitted for amino acid sequence analysis (Argo BioAnalytica, Inc.). PI4KIII was partially purified from bovine adrenal medulla following the procedure of Downing et al. (18Downing G.J. Kim S. Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, tissue was extracted with buffer A containing 1m NaCl, and the fraction of supernatant precipitated at 40% saturation of ammonium sulfate was dialyzed against buffer A containing 30 mm NaCl. Dialyzed sample was loaded on a DEAE-cellulose column, and PI4KIII was eluted with a linear 30–500 mm NaCl gradient. Using a 300-bp (EcoRI/HindIII) fragment from a mouse EST (GenBankTM accession number AI385489, obtained from ATCCTM), a rat brain λ−ZAPII cDNA library was screened using standard procedures (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York1989Google Scholar), yielding 10 overlapping clones that covered the entire coding region of PI4KII. A 1.5-kilobase pair cDNA fragment encoding the full-length sequence was subcloned intoEcoRI/PstI sites of pCMV5Myc vectors. The mycPI4KII cDNA construct was used as the template for generating mutants by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChangeTM Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit, and the presence of appropriate mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The deletion mutant ΔCCPCC was created using the following primers: 5′-GGCTTCAGAAGCTGTTTGGCCGAGATTGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCAATCTCGGCCAAACAGCTTCTGAAGCC-3′. Truncation mutant 92–487 was made with primers 5′-CCGGAATTCTACACGCCGTTCAGACCCACCGCGAG-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTCTACCACCATGAAAAGAAGGGCTTC-3′. COS cells were transfected with cDNAs of wild type or mutant PI4KII in pCMV5Myc vectors using DEAE-dextran according to Schwartz and Rosenberg (20Schwartz J.J. Rosenberg R. Ravid K. Freshney R.I. DNA Transfer to Cultured Cells. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1998: 179-192Google Scholar). Typical transfection efficiency was 20%. COS cells transfected with Myc-PI4KII cDNA were washed in PBS; resuspended in solution containing 0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors; and permeabilized by freezing and thawing. The suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g to obtain post-nuclear supernatant, which was subsequently centrifuged for 15 min at 200,000 × g to obtain cytosol (supernatant) and membrane (pellet) fractions. Pellets were extracted for 15 min on ice with a solution containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (15 min at 200,000 × g), and the supernatant, representing the membrane-bound pool, was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody and assayed for PtdIns 4-kinase activity. The enzymatic activity was assayed using either total Triton X-100 extracts of cell membranes (Fig. 2, b andd–i) or immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 2 c). When membrane extracts were assayed, the activities of similar extracts from mock-transfected cells were subtracted from each data point. For immunoprecipitation of recombinant PI4KII, Triton X-100 extracts of membrane fractions described above were precleared by 30-min incubation with protein G-Sepharose and then incubated with anti-Myc antibodies chemically cross-linked to protein G-Sepharose with DMP. PtdIns 4-kinase activity was measured by phosphorylation of PtdIns micelles using [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/mmol) as phosphate donor. Typically, kinase (in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) was preincubated for 10 min with PtdIns prepared by sonication with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 0.4% Triton X-100, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reactions were initiated by adding ATP and MgCl2 at final concentrations of 0.2 mm and 15 mm, respectively, and carried out at room temperature for 15 min. Phospholipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (21Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar) and separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) in n-propyl alcohol/H20/NH4OH (65:20:15) solvent system. For quantification, a range of [γ-32P]ATP concentrations were also spotted on TLC plates. Radioactive spots were detected by autoradiography, scraped, and radioactivity measured by scintillation counting. Cells were radiolabeled with [3H]palmitate (0.3 μCi/ml) for 2 h as described by Linder et al. (22Linder M.E. Kleuss C. Mumby S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 314-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), washed with cold PBS, then lysed with buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors for 15 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 200,000 × g, and Myc-tagged PI4KII was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibodies as described above. Palmitoylation was detected by autoradiography. Sequence data base searches against the nonredundant protein data base maintained at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, MD) were performed using the PSI-BLAST program (23Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59929) Google Scholar) with various parameters run to convergence. The data base hits identified in the initial searches were used as queries for additional PSI-BLAST searches. The phylogenetic tree was constructed with the PHYLIP package (24Felsenstein J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 418-427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by the distance method (protdist program). Neighbor-joining algorithm (neighbor program) was utilized to construct the phylogenetic tree from the distance matrix. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Protein concentrations were determined using the modified Lowry method (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) according to Peterson (26Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 201-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was carried out by the method of Towbin et al. (28Towbin H.T. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar) as described previously (29Wagner M. Barylko B. Albanesi J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To obtain amino acid sequence information, PI4KII was partially purified from bovine adrenal chromaffin granule membranes (14Husebye E.S. Letcher A.J. Lander D.J. Flatmark T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1042: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Fig.1, a and b). As reported previously (12Endemann G. Dunn S.N. Cantley L.C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6845-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Walker D.H. Dougherty N. Pike L.J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 16297-16304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a major 55-kDa electrophoretic band was prominent in SDS gels of active fractions from an SP-Sepharose ion exchange column. However, a more slowly migrating component, sometimes poorly resolved, was also evident. The gels were sliced, renatured, and assayed for PtdIns 4-kinase activity. Only the upper, minor component of the 55-kDa doublet was active. The lower band was identified as cytochrome P450 by mass spectrometry. The electrophoretic band containing PtdIns 4-kinase activity was excised for internal amino acid sequence analysis, and the sequences of five peptides were obtained. Although these sequences did not correspond to those of any known proteins, two peptide sequences were found within a 443-bp mouse EST clone. With this information, a 300-bp nucleotide probe was generated and used to screen a rat brain cDNA library. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences of overlapping clones allowed us to determine the complete amino acid sequence of rat PI4KII, corresponding to a protein of M r 54,305 (Fig.1 c). All five of the original peptide sequences were found in this full-length sequence. Based on the rat sequence we identified predicted homologs in numerous genome data bases, some of which are presented in the phylogenetic tree in Fig. 4. The sequences of putative human and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) PI4KIIs are aligned with the rat sequence in Fig. 1 c. To confirm that our derived sequence encodes an authentic Type II PtdIns 4-kinase, the Myc-tagged recombinant protein was expressed in COS cells, and its properties were characterized (Fig.2). The expressed protein has an electrophoretic mobility consistent with its molecular weight of ∼55,000, and, like endogenous PI4KII, it is found almost exclusively in the membrane fraction after high speed centrifugation (Fig.2 a), but can be solubilized by 1% Triton X-100. Homogenates of cells transfected with rat PI4KII typically have 10-fold higher specific activities than homogenates from untransfected or mock-transfected cells. Membrane fractions account for most of this excess activity (Fig. 2 b) correlating well with the distribution of the overexpressed protein. To determine the substrate specificity of PI4KII, the Myc-tagged kinase was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibodies from overexpressing cells. As shown in Fig. 2 c, the immunoprecipitated kinase did not phosphorylate PtdIns3P, PtdIns4P, or PtdIns5P to yield PtdInsP2; only PtdInsP was generated, presumably from trace contaminations of PtdIns in some of the PtdInsP preparations. Thus, PI4KII specifically phosphoryltates only PtdIns. The expressed kinase displays all of the enzymatic characteristics previously reported for the native PI4KII (3Balla T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 69-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 9Gehrmann T. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 30Martin T.F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 31Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11147-11156Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar): it has relatively low K m values for ATP (∼88 μm) (Fig. 2 d) and for PtdIns (∼45 μm) (Fig. 2 e); it is inhibited by low concentrations of adenosine (Fig. 2 f), but not by PAO (Fig.2 g) or wortmannin (Fig. 2 h); and it is inhibited by monoclonal antibody 4C5G (Fig. 2 i), which specifically recognizes the Type II kinase (8Endemann G.C. Graziani A. Cantley L.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Type III PtdIns 4-kinases have relatively high K m values for ATP (>400 μm) and PtdIns (∼120 μm), require millimolar adenosine concentrations for inhibition, and are sensitive to wortmannin (Fig. 2 h) and PAO (Fig. 2 g). Although both native and recombinant forms of PI4KII behave as integral membrane proteins, sequence analysis does not reveal an obvious transmembrane domain. The only portion of the rat enzyme with a predominantly hydrophobic character is an alanine/valine-rich segment (residues 74–95) that is predicted to adopt an α-helical conformation. However, a truncation mutant (92) lacking most of this hydrophobic segment still behaves as an integral membrane protein,i.e. it is soluble only in the presence of detergent (Fig.3 b). An alternative mode of tight membrane association is through covalently attached lipids. Rat PI4KII does not contain consensus myristoylation or prenylation motifs, but a cysteine-rich segment (CCPCC, residues 173–177) is a potential palmitoylation site. Indeed, wild type PI4KII and truncation mutant 92–487 are palmitoylated in cells, whereas a mutant lacking residues 173–177 (ΔCCPCC) is not (Fig. 3 a). Both ΔCCPCC and the 92–487,ΔCCPCC double mutants behave as peripheral, rather than integral, membrane proteins; they can be solubilized by sodium carbonate, pH 10, though not by 1 m NaCl (Fig.3 b). The ΔCCPCC mutant is catalytically inactive, but there is insufficient evidence to conclude from this that palmitoylation is essential for activity. A search of protein sequence data bases using the PSI-BLAST program (23Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59929) Google Scholar) identified PI4KII homologs in Drosophila melanogaster,Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana,S. cerevisiae, and other organisms (Fig.4). The only prokaryotic sequences that belong to this family are from Mycobacterium, the organism in which inositol-containing lipids were first identified (32Vance D.E. Vance D.E. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1991: 205-240Google Scholar). In addition to the putative orthologs of rat PI4KII, another family of more distantly related sequences was found using the PSI-BLAST program. This group is designated FJ-like putative kinases in Fig. 4 for its best characterized member, Drosophila Four-jointed, a membrane-bound or secreted protein with no known enzymatic activity, but apparently involved in development of ommatidia (33Zeidler M.P. Perrimon N. Strutt D.I. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1363-1372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although it is much too early to assign lipid or protein kinase activity to Four-jointed protein or its mouse and human orthologs, the homology to known kinase catalytic domains merits further examination.

The carboxyl terminus of each ENaC subunit contains a PPxY, motif which is believed to be important for interaction with the WW domains of the ubiquitin-protein ligase, Nedd4. Disruption of this interaction, as in Liddle's syndrome, where mutations delete or alter the PPxY motif of either the β or γ subunits, has been proposed to result in increased ENaC activity. Here we present evidence that KIAA0439 protein, a close relative of Nedd4, is also a potential regulator of ENaC. We demonstrate that KIAA0439 WW domains bind all three ENaC subunits. We show that a recombinant KIAA0439 WW domain protein acts as a dominant negative mutant that can interfere with the Na+-dependent feedback inhibition of ENaC in whole-cell patch clamp experiments. We propose that KIAA0439 and Nedd4 proteins either play a redundant role in ENaC regulation or function in a tissue- and/or signal-specific manner to down-regulate ENaC.

Nedd4 consists of a ubiquitin-protein ligase domain, multiple WW domains, and a Ca2+ and lipid binding domain (20Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 21Kumar S. Tomooka Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The Ca2+ and lipid binding domain has been shown to mediate Ca2+-dependent redistribution of Nedd4 from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane (29Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and has recently been demonstrated to associate in a Ca2+-dependent manner with annexin XIIIb, a protein concentrated in apical rafts (30Plant P.J. Lafont F. Lecat S. Verkade P. Simons K. Rotin D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1473-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).In addition to Nedd4, there are now a number of proteins known to share a similar modular structure to Nedd4. Some of the Nedd4 family members have been implicated in ubiquitin-mediated regulation of several cellular proteins (31Harvey K.F. Kumar S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 166-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The Nedd4-like protein that is most homologous to human Nedd4 is human KIAA0439, encoded by an unpublished cDNA sequence in the GenBankTM data base (accession no. AB007899). These observations prompted us to investigate whether KIAA0439 could also regulate ENaC function. Our hypothesis was further supported by our observation that a Nedd4-likeXenopus protein, claimed to be the homolog of mammalian Nedd4 (32Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. DNA Seq. 1998; 9: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), had been shown to regulate ENaC activity inXenopus oocytes (28Abriel H. Loffing J. Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. Schild L. Horisberger J.-D. Rotin D. Staub O. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). A close examination of the homology and sequence alignment of this protein with the Nedd4-like proteins in the data base suggested that the Xenopus protein is more closely related to KIAA0439 than to Nedd4 (see below). Given that KIAA0439 and Nedd4 are highly related but distinct proteins in mammals, the results obtained by Abriel et al. (28Abriel H. Loffing J. Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. Schild L. Horisberger J.-D. Rotin D. Staub O. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) suggest that mammalian KIAA0439 could also play a key role in the regulation of ENaC. In this communication we present evidence that mammalian KIAA0439 and Nedd4 may have overlapping or redundant roles in the regulation of ENaC function.

The Ca2+ and lipid binding domain has been shown to mediate Ca2+-dependent redistribution of Nedd4 from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane (29Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and has recently been demonstrated to associate in a Ca2+-dependent manner with annexin XIIIb, a protein concentrated in apical rafts (30Plant P.J. Lafont F. Lecat S. Verkade P. Simons K. Rotin D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1473-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition to Nedd4, there are now a number of proteins known to share a similar modular structure to Nedd4. Some of the Nedd4 family members have been implicated in ubiquitin-mediated regulation of several cellular proteins (31Harvey K.F. Kumar S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 166-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The Nedd4-like protein that is most homologous to human Nedd4 is human KIAA0439, encoded by an unpublished cDNA sequence in the GenBankTM data base (accession no. AB007899). These observations prompted us to investigate whether KIAA0439 could also regulate ENaC function. Our hypothesis was further supported by our observation that a Nedd4-likeXenopus protein, claimed to be the homolog of mammalian Nedd4 (32Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. DNA Seq. 1998; 9: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), had been shown to regulate ENaC activity inXenopus oocytes (28Abriel H. Loffing J. Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. Schild L. Horisberger J.-D. Rotin D. Staub O. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). A close examination of the homology and sequence alignment of this protein with the Nedd4-like proteins in the data base suggested that the Xenopus protein is more closely related to KIAA0439 than to Nedd4 (see below). Given that KIAA0439 and Nedd4 are highly related but distinct proteins in mammals, the results obtained by Abriel et al. (28Abriel H. Loffing J. Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. Schild L. Horisberger J.-D. Rotin D. Staub O. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) suggest that mammalian KIAA0439 could also play a key role in the regulation of ENaC. In this communication we present evidence that mammalian KIAA0439 and Nedd4 may have overlapping or redundant roles in the regulation of ENaC function. We thank Drs. T. Nagase, N. A. Jenkins, and C. A. Ross for providing cDNA clones for various Nedd4-like proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2057836655,"The A subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) consists of 15 nonidentical repeats. The catalytic C subunit binds to C-terminal repeats 11 - 15 and regulatory B subunits bind to N-terminal repeats 1 - 10. Recently, four cancer-associated mutants of the A-alpha subunit have been described: Glu64-->Asp in lung carcinoma, Glu64-->Gly in breast carcinoma, Arg418-->Trp in melanoma, and Delta171 - 589 in breast carcinoma. Based on our model of PP2A, we predicted that Glu64-->Asp and Glu64-->Gly might be defective in B subunit binding, whereas Arg418-->Trp and Delta171 - 589 might bind neither B nor C subunits. We generated these mutants by site-directed mutagenesis and assayed their ability to associate with different forms of B subunits (B, B', B"") or with the catalytic C subunit. The results demonstrate that all mutants are defective in binding either B or B and C subunits. Specifically, the N-terminal mutants, Glu64-->Asp and Glu64-->Gly, are defective in B' but normal in B, B"", and C subunit binding, whereas the C-terminal mutants Arg418-->Trp and Delta171 - 589 bind none of the B subunits nor the C subunit. The implications of these findings with regard to the potential role of PP2A as a tumor suppressor are discussed. Oncogene (2001) 20, 10 - 15."

https://openalex.org/W2013747285,"A detailed knowledge of Himalayan development is important for our wider understanding of several global processes, ranging from models of plateau uplift to changes in oceanic chemistry and climate. Continental sediments 55 Myr old found in a foreland basin in Pakistan are, by more than 20 Myr, the oldest deposits thought to have been eroded from the Himalayan metamorphic mountain belt. This constraint on when erosion began has influenced models of the timing and diachrony of the India-Eurasia collision, timing and mechanisms of exhumation and uplift, as well as our general understanding of foreland basin dynamics. But the depositional age of these basin sediments was based on biostratigraphy from four intercalated marl units. Here we present dates of 257 detrital grains of white mica from this succession, using the 40Ar-39Ar method, and find that the largest concentration of ages are at 36-40 Myr. These dates are incompatible with the biostratigraphy unless the mineral ages have been reset, a possibility that we reject on the basis of a number of lines of evidence. A more detailed mapping of this formation suggests that the marl units are structurally intercalated with the continental sediments and accordingly that biostratigraphy cannot be used to date the clastic succession. The oldest continental foreland basin sediments containing metamorphic detritus eroded from the Himalaya orogeny therefore seem to be at least 15-20 Myr younger than previously believed, and models based on the older age must be re-evaluated."

Of the different cell types found in neurofibromas, Schwann cells usually provide between 40 and 80%, and are thought to be critical for tumor growth. Here we describe the identification of growth factors that are upregulated in NF1−/− mouse Schwann cells and are potential regulators of angiogenesis and cell growth. Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and midkine (MK) were found to be induced by loss of neurofibromin and MK was further characterized. MK was induced in human neurofibromas, schwannomas, and various nervous system tumors associated with NF1 or NF2; midkine showed an expression pattern overlapping but distinct from its homolog pleiotrophin (PTN). Immunohistochemistry revealed expression of MK in S-100 positive Schwann cells of dermal and plexiform neurofibromas, and in endothelial cells of tumor blood vessels, but not in normal blood vessels. Furthermore, MK demonstrated potent mitogenic activity for human systemic and brain endothelial cells in vitro and stimulated proliferation and soft agar colony formation of human MPNST derived S100 positive cells and fibroblastoid cells derived from an NF1 neurofibroma. The data support a possible central role for MK as a mediator of angiogenesis and neurofibroma growth in NF1."
https://openalex.org/W2320643989,"The present study focused on interactions between signaling pathways activated by progestins and by type I and II receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in mammary tumors. An experimental model in which the synthetic progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) induced mammary adenocarcinomas in Balb/c mice was used. MPA-stimulated proliferation, both in vivo and in vitro, of progestin-dependent tumors induced up-regulation of ErbB-2 protein levels and tyrosine phosphorylation of this receptor. Combinations of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ASODNs) directed to ErbB-2 mRNA with ASODNs directed to the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) were used to study the effect of the simultaneous block of these receptors on the MPA-induced proliferation of epithelial cells from the progestin-dependent C4HD line. Neither synergistic nor additive effects on the inhibition of MPA-induced proliferation of C4HD cells were observed as a result of the combination of these ASODNs. Suppression of IGF-IR expression by ASODNs resulted in complete abrogation of MPA-induced phosphorylation of ErbB-2 in C4HD cells, whereas blockage of ErbB-2 did not affect IGF-IR phosphorylation. These results show the existence of a hierarchical interaction between IGF-IR and ErbB-2, by means of which IGF-IR directs ErbB-2 phosphorylation. We demonstrated, for the first time, that this hierarchical interaction involves physical association of both receptors, resulting in the formation of a heteromeric complex. Furthermore, confocal laser microscopy experiments demonstrated that MPA was able to induce co-localization of ErbB-2 and IGF-IR. This hetero-oligomer was also found in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells in which association of IGF-IR and ErbB-2 was induced by heregulin and IGF-I. Oncogene (2001) 20, 34 - 47."

Here, we show that in HeLa cells TNFα induces expression of p22PRG1/IEX-1 in an NF-κB dependent fashion. Blockade of NF-κB activation by various NF-κB inhibitors abolished TNFα-induced p22PRG1/IEX-1 expression and increased the sensitivity to apoptosis induced by TNFα, an activating Fas-antibody or the anti-cancer drug etoposide. Surprisingly, ectopic expression of p22PRG1/IEX-1 in HeLa cells transfected with an inducible p22PRG1/IEX-1-expression vector augments the susceptibility to apoptosis initiated by death-receptor ligands or by etoposide. In addition, p22PRG1/IEX-1 expressing HeLa cells exhibit an accelerated progression through the cell cycle. Transfection of an antisense hammerhead ribozyme targeted to p22PRG1/IEX-1 reduced the speed in cell cycle progression and decreased the apoptotic response to death ligands. Our data demonstrate that p22PRG1/IEX-1 is specifically induced during NF-κB activation, but this seems not to be related to the anti-apoptotic actions of NF-κB. Instead, NF-κB dependent recruitment of p22PRG1/IEX-1 might be related to a modulation in the cell cycle, and hereby, p22PRG1/IEX-1 may accelerate cell growth on the one hand, but may trigger apoptosis on the other."

TGF-beta is a multipotent cytokine that elicits many biological functions. In particular, TGF-beta exhibits effects on the cell cycle manifested by G1-phase arrest, differentiation, or apoptosis of several target cells, suggesting that disruption of TGF-beta signaling pathway could be involved in cancer formation. Here we show one missense mutation of the Smad4 gene in the MH1 domain (P102L) and one frame shift mutation resulting in termination in the MH2 domain (Delta(483 - 552)) in acute myelogeneous leukemia. Both of the mutated Smad4 proteins lack transcriptional activities. Concomitant expression of the P102L mutant with wild-type Smad4 inactivates wild-type Smad4 through inhibiting its DNA-binding ability. The Delta(483 - 552) mutant blocks nuclear translocation of wild-type Smad4 and thus disrupts TGF-beta signaling. This is the first report showing that mutations in the Smad4 gene are associated with the pathogenesis of acute myelogeneous leukemia and the obtained results should provide useful insights into the mechanism whereby disruption of TGF-beta signaling pathway could lead to acute myelogeneous leukemia.

To assay total p38 activity, a monoclonal antibody (New England BioLabs 9219) that binds to the phosphorylated form (Thr180/Tyr182) of all four p38 isoforms was used to immunoprecipitate active p38 kinase from cell lysates. The precipitated p38 was then assayed for activity based on its ability to phosphorylate ATF-2. ATF-2 phosphorylation (at Thr71) was detected by immunoblot using a rabbit anti-[phospho-Thr71]ATF-2-specific antibody (New England BioLabs 9221S). ERK1/2 activity was monitored by immunoprecipitation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 using a monoclonal antibody (New England BioLabs 9109) that binds to Thr202/Tyr204-phosphorylated ERK1/2.

This virus was purified and used as an empty control adenovirus. The green fluorescent protein-encoding virus, CMV-GFP, was used to define the optimal adenovirus infection multiplicity. Recombinant adenoviruses were propagated in 293 cells and purified by cesium chloride centrifugation. pINV-2473, a plasmid encoding the human involucrin gene promoter fused to luciferase, was constructed as previously described (5Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Total keratinocyte poly(A+) RNA was isolated using the Oligotex Direct mRNA protocol (Qiagen). Equivalent quantities of mRNA were assayed by real time RT-PCR using an RNA amplification kit (SYBR Green I, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Melting curve analysis of the PCR products distinguished the higher melting-specific PCR product from nonspecific products. For quantification, following the elongation step in each PCR cycle and just prior to the fluorescence reading, the reaction temperature was stepped up to the temperature required to melt nonspecific PCR products. Primers amplifying a 330-bp fragment of thehINV gene, primers amplifying individual p38 isoforms, and primers amplifying a 600-bp fragment of the human GAPDH gene were used in parallel. hINV mRNA quantities were normalized based on GAPDH mRNA levels. The GAPDH primers were 5′-CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGCA and 5′-CCACCTGGACTGGACGGCAGATCT and the hINV primers were 5′-CTCCACCAAAGCCTCTGC and 5′-CTGCTTAAGCTGCTGCTC. Primers for detection of p38α, p38β, p38δ, and p38γ were as previously described (17Hale K.K. Trollinger D. Rihanek M. Manthey C.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4246-4252PubMed Google Scholar). MEK7 mRNA was detected by real time RT-PCR using MEK7-specific primers (5′-ATCCCCGAGCGCATTCTGG, and 5′-TTGATCTGGCCCCGCTCGTC). These primers amplify a 120-nucleotide segment of human MEK7. To determine which MAPK is activated in the presence of MEK7, we delivered wild-type or constitutively active MEK7 to keratinocytes using adenovirus. As shown in Fig. 1 A, p38 kinase activity is not detected in mock-infected cells or cells infected with empty adenoviral vector; however, the presence of wt or caMEK7 results in activation of endogenous p38 MAPK. To compare the relative activity of wtMEK7 and caMEK7, we measured the level of each protein in infected cells by immunoblot (Fig. 1 B). When corrected for level of expression, wt and caMEK7 appeared to be equally effective activators of p38 activity. We further tested caMEK7 as a regulator of JNK and ERK activity. In addition to the marked increase in p38 MAPK activity, caMEK7 also produced a modest increase in JNK activity (3-fold), but did not regulate ERK activity (Fig. 1 C). In addition, as shown in Fig. 1 D, MEK7 did not alter p38, JNK, or ERK protein level, suggesting that the changes in p38 and JNK activity are caused by increased activity of pre-existing enzymes. To identify the specific p38 isoforms that are regulated by MEK7, we performed three types of experiments. First, we used real time RT-PCR to measure the level of mRNA encoding each individual p38 isoform. The results indicate that keratinocytes express all p38 isoforms except p38γ (Fig. 2 A). p38α and p38β are the most abundant, followed by p38δ. To measure the activity of individual p38 isoforms, we coinfected cells with adenoviruses encoding FLAG-tagged forms of each p38 isoform in the presence or absence of caMEK7. After 48 h, individual p38 isoforms were precipitated using anti-FLAG antibody, and the activity of the precipitated antibody was monitored based on ability to phosphorylate ATF-2. As shown in Fig. 2 B, in the absence of MEK7, the only p38 isoform displaying substantial activity is p38α. A similar profile is observed in the presence of caMEK7, except that p38α activity is slightly increased. As expected, no activity is observed in cells not infected with FLAG-p38 expression virus. The results shown inpanels A and B suggest that p38β, p38δ, and p38γ are not involved in mediating the MEK7-dependent activation. To further examine the role of p38α, we mock-infected cells, or infected cells with empty virus or caMEK7-encoding virus. After 48 h, we precipitated endogenous p38α using a specific antibody, and monitored the level of activated enzyme based on its ability to phosphorylate ATF-2. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the presence of caMEK7 increases endogenous p38α activity. In addition, although not shown, a smaller increase in activity was also detected for cells infected with wtMEK7-encoding adenovirus. To confirm the specificity of the p38α antibody, we infected cells with empty vector or a virus encoding p38α and then detected expression of p38α by immunoblot using anti-p38α. As shown in Fig. 2 D, the antibody detects a single band in cells infected with empty vector. This band corresponds to the migration of expressed FLAG-p38α, when the migration is adjusted for the contribution of the FLAG tag (lane α). The antibody also nonspecifically cross-reacts with overexpressed FLAG-p38β but does not detect p38δ. Our previous studies suggest that a PKC-activated cascade can act via MEK1, MEK3, and MEK7 to regulate hINV gene expression (6Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 7Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1601-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To directly examine the role of MEK7 as a regulator of hINV gene expression, we transfected keratinocytes with the hINV gene promoter reporter plasmid, pINV-2473 (5Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), followed by infection with empty or MEK7-encoding adenoviruses. As shown in Fig.3 A, wtMEK7and caMEK7 increase promoter activity by 2- and 8-fold, respectively. This regulation appears to be physiological, because, as shown in Fig. 3 B, real time RT-PCR shows that hINV mRNA is increased by 4-fold in the presence of caMEK7. hINV protein levels also increase. hINV protein is not readily detected in mock- or empty vector-infected keratinocytes (Fig. 3 C); however, the level is increased in the presence of caMEK7. Moreover, SB203580, an agent that inhibits p38α and p38β activity at concentrations less than 1–2 μm (18Cuenda A. Cohen P. Buee S. cherrer V. Goedert M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), inhibits the caMEK7-dependent activation at a concentration of 0.5 μm (19Kumar S. McDonnell P.C. Gum R.J. Hand A.T. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 20Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1741-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). MEK7 has been reported to activate JNK (9Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1569-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, MEK7 increases JNK activity in keratinocytes (Fig. 1 C). To test the importance of this regulation, we monitored the effects of JNK inactivation onhINV promoter activity. Keratinocytes were transfected with pINV-2473 and in the presence or absence of plasmid-encoding dnJNK followed 24 h later by MEK7-encoding adenovirus. As shown in Fig.4 A, inactivation of JNK by dnJNK results in an increase in wtMEK7- and caMEK7-associated promoter activity. This result suggests that JNK is a negative regulator ofhINV promoter activity. The MAPK kinase cascades provide an important mode of transferring regulatory information from the cell surface to the nucleus (1Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). These cascades include a 3-kinase module that includes a MAPK kinase kinase (MEKK), a MAPK kinase (MEK), and a MAPK. Four major mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) have been identified including ERK1/2, ERK5, p38 MAPK, and the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK, Refs. 8Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar,21Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D.

Dual phosphorylation of the regulatory loop of these kinases by MEKs results in MAPK activation (8Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The MEK family includes MEK1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Each of these MEK enzymes has a preferred downstream target. For example, MEK1/2 activates ERK1/2, MEK5 activates ERK5/BMK1, MEK3 and MEK6 activate the p38 MAPKs, MEK4 activates p38 and JNK kinases, and MEK7 has been reported to be a specific activator of JNK (8Whitmarsh A.J.

We have investigated the role of these enzymes as regulators of differentiation in epidermal keratinocytes, particularly their role in regulating expression of the differentiation marker, involucrin. Involucrin is specifically expressed in the suprabasal layers in stratifying squamous surface epithelia, and expression in cultured cells is increased by agents that enhance keratinocyte differentiation (26Green H. The Harvey Lectures. 1980; 74: 101-139PubMed Google Scholar, 27Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Robinson N.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 397-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 28Rice R.H. Green H. Cell. 1979; 18: 681-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). A study of the regulatory inputs that regulate this gene suggest that the MAPK cascades play a central role in maintaining both basal and regulated expression (6Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F.

Eckert R.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Using dominant-negative kinases and pharmacologic agents to identify important regulatory enzymes, the results suggest that p38 activity is required for activation, and that ERK and JNK kinase activity are not required. Expression of the dominant-negative form of p38α completely inactivates normal regulation (6Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). An exploration of other candidate enzymes in these cascades suggest that the novel protein kinase C isoforms are involved, as are Ras and MEKK1 (7Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1601-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Other enzymes, including Raf1, do not appear to play a role. MEKK1, in turn, appears to target several MEKs, including MEK1, MEK3, and MEK7, but not MEK4 (6Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Expression of dominant-negative forms of MEK1, MEK3, or MEK7 eliminates MEKK1-dependent regulation. Downstream targets of this pathway include C/EBP and AP1 transcription factors that, in turn, bind to specific DNA elements that have been identified in thehINV promoter proximal and distal regulatory regions to regulate transcription (5Welter J.F.

Zaim T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30460-30465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Taken together these results suggest that the MEKs transmit the regulatory signal via the p38 MAPKs. MEK3 is a known activator of p38 MAPK isoforms (19Kumar S. McDonnell P.C. Gum R.J. Hand A.T. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 20Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1741-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 31Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar), and so our results suggest that one major pathway that mediates regulation includes MEKK1, MEK3, and p38. However, the downstream target of MEK7 was not identified. Previous studies suggest that MEK7 is a specific activator of JNK kinase (9Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1569-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,32Ross S.E. Erickson R.L. Hemati N. MacDougald O.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8433-8441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, because JNK does not appear to mediate the regulation in keratinocytes (6Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 7Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1601-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), it appeared unlikely that JNK could be the downstream target. We therefore examined the role of MEK7 as an activator of p38 MAPKs. The present studies show that adenovirus-mediated expression of caMEK7 or wtMEK7 in keratinocytes results in an increase in total p38 activity. Interestingly, both wild-type and constitutively active MEK7 were able to active p38, a result that is consistent with the ability of the wild-type form of other signaling enzymes (e.g. MEKK1) to activate this cascade (6Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In addition, MEK7 produced a modest activation of JNK (3-fold) but did not regulate ERK activity. Among the p38 family members, p38α and p38β appear to be ubiquitously expressed (23Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17920-17926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). In contrast, p38γ is expressed in muscle where it plays a role in differentiation regulation (33Li Z. Jiang Y. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 34Lechner C. Zahalka M.A. Giot J.F. Moller N.P. Ullrich A. Prod. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4355-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and p38δ is enriched in lung, kidney, testis, pancreas, and intestine (19Kumar S. McDonnell P.C. Gum R.J. Hand A.T. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). To identify the p38 family members involved in the regulation, we analyzed p38 mRNA levels in keratinocytes using quantitative real time RT-PCR (17Hale K.K. Trollinger D. Rihanek M. Manthey C.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4246-4252PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies show that p38α and p38β are the major forms present in keratinocytes with p38δ also present at significant levels. p38γ is absent, thus eliminating it as a possible MEK7 downstream target. Three types of functional studies support a role of p38α MAPK as a mediator of MEK7-dependent signaling. First, total p38 activity is minimally detected in cells infected with empty adenovirus and markedly increased in cells infected with MEK7-encoding adenovirus. Second, infection of cells with individual FLAG-tagged p38 isoform reveal that p38β, p38δ, and p38γ are inactive in the presence or absence of MEK7. Third, a specific role for p38α was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of increased levels of active p38α from cells expressing MEK7. One puzzling feature of these data is the high level of p38α activity in cells expressing FLAG-tagged p38α (Fig. 2 B). We would have expected, based on the other results presented in the manuscript, that this activity would be low. However, similar results have been reported in other systems (14Wang Y. Su B. Sah V.P. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5423-5426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 35Alonso G. Ambrosino C. Jones M. Nebreda A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40641-40648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For example, Alonso et al., (35Alonso G. Ambrosino C. Jones M. Nebreda A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40641-40648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) showed that recombinant p38α exhibits significant activity in the absence of MEK kinases, and that this activity markedly increased with a slight increase in MEK levels. In contrast, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ were substantially less sensitive. Thus it is conceivable that when present at high levels, p38α may become activated by the endogenous MEKs. Despite this, p38α activity did increase in the presence of MEK7. Taken together with the involucrin gene regulatory data, these results suggest that MEK7 is a physiologic regulator of keratinocyte differentiation; it is expressed at high levels in epidermis (9Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1569-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yao Z. Diener K. Wang X.S. Zukowski M. Matsumoto G. Zhou G. Mo R. Sasaki T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32378-32383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and it regulates hINV promoter activity and expression of the endogenous involucrin gene. Real time RT-PCR also confirms that MEK7 mRNA is present in cultured keratinocytes (not shown). MEK7 is 47 and 43% homologous to MEK6 and MEK3, respectively, proteins that have been previously shown to regulate p38 MAP kinase (9Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1569-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As noted above, MEK7 has been reported to be a specific activator of JNK in a variety of cell types. For example, previous reports show that MEK7 activates JNK in 293T cells (10Yao Z. Diener K. Wang X.S. Zukowski M. Matsumoto G. Zhou G. Mo R. Sasaki T. Nishina H. Hui C.C. Tan T.H. Woodgett J.P. Penninger J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32378-32383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (14Wang Y. Su B. Sah V.P. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5423-5426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), and in CHO cells (9Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1569-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present results argue that MEK7 activates both JNK and p38 in keratinocytes, and that the p38 activation appears to be more substantial. To our knowledge, this is among the first reports suggesting that p38 MAPK is a MEK7 target. A recent report indicates that MEK7, along with MEK3, 4 and 6, can activate p38δ in 293T cells (36Hu M.C. Wang Y.P. Mikhail A. Qiu W.R. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7095-7102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The outcome of our experiments suggest that MEK7-dependent regulation of downstream kinase activation may be tissue- or perhaps cell-type specific with respect to MEK7 targets. An additional point of interest in the present study, is the observation that JNK appears to suppress hINV promoter activity. This is consistent with a recent report indicating that JNK inhibits expression of the SPRR1B gene, another gene that, like involucrin, is regulated in a differentiation-dependent manner in squamous epithelia (37Vuong H. Patterson T. Shapiro P. Kalvakolanu D.V. Wu R. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. Kleeberger S.R. Reddy S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32250-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that coincident regulation by MEK7 of p38α and JNK activity may function as a mechanism to determine the overall level of hINV gene expression, with p38α functioning to increase and JNK functioning to decrease expression (Fig.4 B). This is likely to be part of a more complex mechanism of signal integration that defines the impact of p38 versusthe JNK signals.

https://openalex.org/W2002442168,"The hamster ornithine decarboxylase antizyme (ODC-Az) cDNA was transfected into the hamster malignant oral keratinocyte cell line, HCPC-1. Ectopic expression of ODC-Az resulted in the reversion of malignant phenotypes and alteration of DNA methylation status of CCGG sites. The phenotypes examined include ODC enzymatic activity, doubling time, morphological change, anchorage dependent growth, tumorigenicity in nude mice, induction of epithelial differentiation marker protein (involucrin), and change of cell cycle position. Comparison of CCGG DNA methylation status of the ODC-Az and control vector transfectants revealed a significant increase in demethylation of 5-methyl cytosines (m5C) of CCGG sites in the ODC-Az transfectants. Ectopic expression of ODC-Az gene in hamster malignant oral keratinocytes led to reduce ODC activity and the subsequent demethylation of 5-methyl cytosines, presumably via the ODC/ polyamines/ decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dc-AdoMet) pathways. Our data suggest that ODC-Az shared the same pathway of polyamines/ dc-AdoMet/DNA methyltransferase (DNA MTase). We propose that ODC-Az mediates a novel mechanism in tumor suppression by DNA demethylation and presumably re-activation of key cellular genes silenced by DNA hypermethylation during cancer development.

The nmMHC-B was found to be expressed in normal Rat 6 embryo fibroblast cell line, but markedly suppressed in the mutant p53val135-transformed Rat 6 cells. To examine the possible involvement of nmMHC-B in cell transformation, we first cloned and sequenced the full length cDNA of rat nmMHC-B, which was then cloned into an ecdysone-expression vector. The resulting construct was introduced into the T2 cell line, a mutant p53val135-transformed Rat 6 cells lacking the expression of the endogenous nmMHC-B. The clonal transfectants, expressing muristerone A-induced nmMHC-B, displayed a slightly flatter morphology and reached to a lower saturation density compared to the parental transformed cells. Reconstitution of actin filamental bundles was also clearly seen in cells overexpressing the nmMHC-B. In soft agar assays, nmMHC-B transfectants formed fewer and substantially smaller colonies than the parental cells in response to muristerone A induction. Moreover, it was strikingly effective in suppressing the tumorigenicity of the T2 cells when tested in nude mice. Thus, the nmMHC-B, known as a component of the cytoskeletal network, may act as a tumor suppressor gene. Our current finding may reveal a novel role of nmMHC-B in regulating cell growth and cell signaling in nonmuscle cells. Oncogene (2001) 20, 58 - 68."
