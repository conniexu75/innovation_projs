https://openalex.org/W2047198066,"Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are porous crystalline materials with tetrahedral networks that resemble those of zeolites: transition metals (Zn, Co) replace tetrahedrally coordinated atoms (for example, Si), and imidazolate links replace oxygen bridges. A striking feature of these materials is that the structure adopted by a given ZIF is determined by link-link interactions, rather than by the structure directing agents used in zeolite synthesis. As a result, systematic variations of linker substituents have yielded many different ZIFs that exhibit known or predicted zeolite topologies. The materials are chemically and thermally stable, yet have the long-sought-after design flexibility offered by functionalized organic links and a high density of transition metal ions. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of two porous ZIFs-ZIF-95 and ZIF-100-with structures of a scale and complexity previously unknown in zeolites. The materials have complex cages that contain up to 264 vertices, and are constructed from as many as 7,524 atoms. As expected from the adsorption selectivity recently documented for other members of this materials family, both ZIFs selectively capture carbon dioxide from several different gas mixtures at room temperature, with ZIF-100 capable of storing 28 litres per litre of material at standard temperature and pressure. These characteristics, combined with their high thermal and chemical stability and ease of fabrication, make ZIFs promising candidate materials for strategies aimed at ameliorating increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels."

Standardization activities must proceed within the auspices of open-access and international working bodies. To tackle the issues surrounding the development of better descriptions of genomic investigations, we have formed the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC). Here, we introduce the minimum information about a genome sequence (MIGS) specification with the intent of promoting participation in its development and discussing the resources that will be required to develop improved mechanisms of metadata capture and exchange. As part of its wider goals, the GSC also supports improving the 'transparency' of the information contained in existing genomic databases."
https://openalex.org/W2036174256,"Rapid climate change has been implicated as a cause of evolution in poorly adapted populations. However, phenotypic plasticity provides the potential for organisms to respond rapidly and effectively to environmental change. Using a 47-year population study of the great tit (Parus major) in the United Kingdom, we show that individual adjustment of behavior in response to the environment has enabled the population to track a rapidly changing environment very closely. Individuals were markedly invariant in their response to environmental variation, suggesting that the current response may be fixed in this population. Phenotypic plasticity can thus play a central role in tracking environmental change; understanding the limits of plasticity is an important goal for future research."
https://openalex.org/W2145005415,"The induced gamma-band EEG response (iGBR) recorded on the scalp is widely assumed to reflect synchronous neural oscillation associated with object representation, attention, memory, and consciousness. The most commonly reported EEG iGBR is a broadband transient increase in power at the gamma range ∼200–300 ms following stimulus onset. A conspicuous feature of this iGBR is the trial-to-trial poststimulus latency variability, which has been insufficiently addressed. Here, we show, using single-trial analysis of concomitant EEG and eye tracking, that this iGBR is tightly time locked to the onset of involuntary miniature eye movements and reflects a saccadic “spike potential.” The time course of the iGBR is related to an increase in the rate of saccades following a period of poststimulus saccadic inhibition. Thus, whereas neuronal gamma-band oscillations were shown conclusively with other methods, the broadband transient iGBR recorded by scalp EEG reflects properties of miniature saccade dynamics rather than neuronal oscillations.

Thus, whereas neuronal gamma-band oscillations were shown conclusively with other methods, the broadband transient iGBR recorded by scalp EEG reflects properties of miniature saccade dynamics rather than neuronal oscillations. Seminal studies in cats and monkeys suggested that single neurons responding to different parts of the same object oscillate synchronously at the gamma frequency range (>20 Hz) (Gray et al., 1989Gray C.M. Konig P. Engel A.K. Singer W. Oscillatory responses in cat visual cortex exhibit inter-columnar synchronization which reflects global stimulus properties.Nature. 1989; 338: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (2854) Google Scholar, Kreiter and Singer, 1996Kreiter A.K. Singer W. Stimulus-dependent synchronization of neuronal responses in the visual cortex of the awake macaque monkey.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2381-2396PubMed Google Scholar). This led to the hypothesis that the neural representation of an object is coded by synchronous gamma-band activity of populations of neurons that encode different parts and features of that object (Gray et al., 1989Gray C.M. Konig P. Engel A.K. Singer W.

Singer W. Stimulus-dependent synchronization of neuronal responses in the visual cortex of the awake macaque monkey.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2381-2396PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, spectral analysis of EEG, recorded from the scalp, revealed enhancement of power at the gamma range at especially two time windows following the presentation of a stimulus: an early phase-locked response around 100 ms poststimulus onset (“evoked” gamma-band response) and a late broadband response around 200–300 ms, which jitters in latency between trials and hence does not contribute to the average event-related potential. The latter response is known as “induced” gamma-band response (iGBR) (Pantev, 1995Pantev C. Evoked and induced gamma-band activity of the human cortex.Brain Topogr. 1995; 7: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In apparent congruity with the neuronal recordings in animals, studies in humans found that the iGBR was enhanced when parts of an image were perceptually bound, yielding the perception of coherent objects (gestalts), relative to when fragments did not “bind” perceptually (Lutzenberger et al., 1995Lutzenberger W.

Numerous studies have examined the scalp iGBR since then and revealed that it is sensitive to various stimulus characteristics, including object familiarity (Gruber and Muller, 2005Gruber T.

Based on the apparent similarity between the early findings at the neuronal level and recent ones from the scalp, in both electrophysiological features and sensitivity to cognitive factors, the current view is that the scalp-recorded transient iGBR reflects a fundamental neural mechanism in which activation of a stored representation of an object is reflected in bursts of synchronous oscillatory activity across a distributed neuronal network (Herrmann et al., 2004Herrmann C.S.

As such, it has been used recently to explore neural object representation and binding in special populations, such as infants (Csibra et al., 2000Csibra G. Davis G. Spratling M.W. Johnson M.H. Gamma oscillations and object processing in the infant brain.Science. 2000; 290: 1582-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and patients with schizophrenia (Uhlhaas et al., 2006Uhlhaas P.J. Linden D.E.J. Singer W. Haenschel C. Lindner M. Maurer K. Rodriguez E. Dysfunctional long-range coordination of neural activity during gestalt perception in schizophrenia.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 8168-8175Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). However, a few lingering questions challenge this interpretation. First, the EEG iGBR peaks within a window of 200–300 ms from stimulus onset and appears across studies as a broadband activity, spanning much of the recordable gamma band. Such broadband and time-limited power increases are typical of short transient responses at the single-trial level (see http://www.dspguide.com/ch10/4.htm) rather than of sustained and periodic oscillatory responses. Second, iGBR is described as “induced,” as opposed to “evoked,” because the response varies in time across single trials, within the 200–300 ms window. Whereas this could be an intrinsic property of oscillating networks, the possibility that the response is time locked to an event other than stimulus onset has not been adequately explored. Here, we examined in detail single trials in a typical EEG experiment evoking a prominent iGBR and complemented the EEG recording with high-resolution binocular eye tracking. This approach provided clear answers to these questions: the single-trial EEG response that is reflected in the increased gamma power is indeed of a transient nature rather than a sustained oscillation; it is tightly time locked to, and in fact coincides with, the onset of miniature saccades; and its time course reflects the dynamics of these saccades. This study does not raise any doubt regarding the important role of gamma-band activity in neural function, as found especially by intracranial recordings (Canolty et al., 2008Canolty R.T. Soltani M.

However, we conclude that the broadband and transient scalp-recorded EEG iGBR, which was the basis for most of the recent theories relating iGBR to high perceptual and cognitive functions, mirrors eye movements following the display of a new image, rather than neuronal oscillation. The experiment aimed originally to find out whether iGBR is modulated mainly by structural coherence of object parts (gestalt) or by the ability of subjects to recognize a familiar object. Drawings of common objects were presented, and subjects (n = 13) had to press a button at the occurrence of a rare target. The objects were masked with 2 wide or 30 narrow bars, and the visible parts either remained in place or were shuffled and rotated, to impair the gestalt (Figure 1A; Experimental Procedures). A pilot experiment showed that the Incoherent 30 bars images (Incoherent-30) could not be recognized, whereas the other images (Coherent-2, Incoherent-2, Coherent-30) were recognizable. Standard induced-gamma analysis (Tallon-Baudry and Bertrand, 1999Tallon-Baudry C. Bertrand O. Oscillatory gamma activity in humans and its role in object representation.Trends Cogn. Sci. 1999; 3: 151-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar; see Experimental Procedures) revealed a typical iGBR at 200–300 ms poststimuli, with a wide distribution maximal at electrode CPz (Figure 1C). Across subjects, the increase in gamma-band power was significant compared to the baseline (p < 0.01) in all conditions except Incoherent-30, in which it was marginal (p = 0.06). Two-way ANOVA with factors Bars (2/30) and Coherence (Coherent/Incoherent) revealed a significant main effect of Bars [F(1,12) = 25.05, p < 10−3] and a significant interaction [F(1,12) = 13.13, p < 0.01; Figures 1A and 1B]. The interaction was due to the fact that the number of bars did not affect the iGBR in the coherent conditions [Coherent-2 versus Coherent-30, t(12) = 0.377, p = 0.71], whereas the Incoherent-30 (meaningless) images elicited a significantly smaller response than the Incoherent-2 images [t(12) = 5.23, p < 10−3]. Thus, this study elicited a typical iGBR, which was sensitive mostly to object recognition. Increase in gamma power across multiple frequencies could be seen in many single-trial CPz spectrograms, at the iGBR time window (see Figure S1 available online). At the same time, the broadband EEG signal typically revealed a short, high-amplitude spike (Figure 2; Note that for space limitations, the figure depicts trials from experiment 2, which implemented an identical paradigm and elicited similar findings). When filtered at the 30–100 Hz band, the same spike seems to be accompanied by additional oscillation, due to “ringing” of the filter when excited by a short impulse (Yeung et al., 2004Yeung N. Bogacz R. Holroyd C.B. Cohen J.D. Detection of synchronized oscillations in the electroencephalogram: An evaluation of methods.Psychophysiology. 2004; 41: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar; and see below). The spikes were not limited in time to the iGBR window of 200–300 ms. Nevertheless, there was a clustering of spikes at this window, preceded by relative quiescence between ∼100–150 ms (Figure 3). Furthermore, as shown by Figure 3, the rate of spikes in the iGBR window corresponded with each subject's average iGBR magnitude. This strongly suggests that the iGBR is the spectrographic reflection of the spikes in the EEG.Figure 3Spike Rates in the High-Pass-Filtered EEGShow full captionRaster plot (A) of EEG spikes in 13 subjects of experiment 1.

EEG scalp distributions depend on the reference electrode. Using the nose as reference, we find the typical broad distribution of the iGBR (Busch et al., 2006Busch N.A. Herrmann C.S. Müller M.M.

Referencing the data to the average of all electrodes (scalp and ocular) shows a parieto-occipital local maximum diminishing toward frontal electrodes, as previously described (Busch et al., 2006Busch N.A.

A cross-laboratory study of event-related gamma activity in a standard object recognition paradigm.Neuroimage. 2006; 33: 1169-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, much stronger activity is in fact observed around the eyes (Figure 1D). This would be missed with traditional displays that include scalp but not eye channels (Busch et al., 2006Busch N.A.

A cross-laboratory study of event-related gamma activity in a standard object recognition paradigm.Neuroimage. 2006; 33: 1169-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To investigate the source of the single-trial spikes, we used video-based eye tracking and EEG, recorded simultaneously in three subjects, using the same paradigm. Typical for fixational eye movements, the eye movement pattern in most trials consisted of periods of small-amplitude jitter (known as drift), separated by fast very small saccades (Engbert, 2006Engbert R.

Brain Res. 2006; 154: 177-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, Martinez-Conde et al., 2004Martinez-Conde S. Macknik S.L. Hubel D.H. The role of fixational eye movements in visual perception.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar; see Figure 2 and Figure S2). We used a published algorithm (Engbert and Kliegl, 2003Engbert R. Kliegl R. Microsaccades uncover the orientation of covert attention.Vision Res. 2003; 43: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) to detect and quantify binocular saccades in the eye-tracker data (see Experimental Procedures). Saccades were found within the epoch surrounding the iGBR window (150–350 ms) in 78%, 27%, and 62% of the trials in our three subjects. Almost all of the saccades (96%) were smaller than 100 minutes of arc (1.6°), and most were smaller than 1° (Figure S3). Figure 4A shows raster plots of saccade onsets for all trials (collapsed across conditions) for the three subjects. For all subjects, saccade rate drops to near quiescence around 100–150 ms following stimulus onset and rebounds to a peak between 200–300 ms, corresponding to the distribution of the spikes seen in the EEG (Figure 4B). Next, we examined the trial-by-trial latency correspondence between the saccade onsets and the EEG peaks. For each subject, the onset latency of the largest saccade occurring within the 150–350 ms window of each trial was determined, and both the eye movement traces and the filtered EEG traces were sorted by the latencies of these saccades (Figures 4C and 4D). Clearly, sorting by saccade latency resulted in ordering the EEG peaks by their latency as well. Congruently, the correlation between the latencies of the saccade onsets and the EEG peaks within the iGBR window was very high (Pearson r = 0.85, 0.84, 0.84, for the three subjects, p < 10−27 in all cases). This trial-by-trial correlation confirms a tight relationship between the saccades and the spikes. Is the occurrence of saccades necessary for the generation of the iGBR? We separated the EEG trials for each subject into two groups based on saccade presence or absence at the iGBR time window. To avoid biasing the comparison, we randomly selected from the larger of the two groups of trials a subset of trials, the same size as the smaller group. However, the same pattern of results described below was also obtained if we took all trials in each group into account. Figure 5 shows that the iGBR is present and larger (relative to all trials combined) if only trials with saccades are included and is completely absent when only trials with no saccades are included. This was true for all conditions and subjects. To confirm this statistically, we sampled the mean gamma magnitude at a window of 30–100 Hz and 200–300 ms of every trial and tested whether there was a significant difference between trials with and without saccades using a mixed-model ANOVA with condition and saccade presence as fixed factors and subjects as random factor. This analysis confirmed a significant effect of saccade presence [F(1,2) = 38.37, p < 0.05]. Further, for every individual subject the increase in gamma was significant for trials with saccades (paired two-tailed t tests compared to the baseline, p < 10−3, Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons), and never for trials without. Without saccades, the gamma magnitude was in fact significantly reduced in two subjects (p < 0.01, corrected) and insignificantly reduced in the third. This reduction is to be expected considering that the magnitude of the iGBR was measured against a prestimulus baseline, in which saccades could be present. Notably, one of the subjects (AM, Figure 5) showed nonsignificant iGBR increase (p = 0.54) when all trials were included, as in the traditional analysis scheme. This subject had relatively few saccades in the iGBR window (less than 30% of trials, Figures 4A and 4C). When only the minority of trials with saccades were included, a clear and significant (p < 10−5) iGBR emerged. Thus, it seems that iGBR depends on the presence of small saccades. Because the spikes underlying the iGBR were found to be time locked to the saccades, we realigned the EEG trials around the saccades onset. EEG trials with no saccades were not included in this analysis. Figures 6B and 6C show the signal across trials at CPz (nose reference), revealing a consistent saccade-related response, both in the broadband and in the narrow-band filtered data. As described above, the oscillation around the peak in the narrow-band filtered data is due to “ringing” of the filter (Figure S4). The saccade-related potential (SRP) has a sharp positive peak with mean latency across all trials of 3.7 ms (SD = 3.12) after the saccade onset, followed by a slower negative component. This pattern was nearly identical across subjects and conditions (Figures 6B and 6C, waveforms). The distribution of the average SRP shows a dipolar distribution with opposite polarity peaks at occipital sites and around the eyes (Figure 6D). To test the possibility that the source is in the orbits, we modeled the epoch of 0–6 ms, surrounding the SRP peak, averaged across subjects, by fixing an equivalent current dipole in the center of each eyeball and allowing the dipoles to freely rotate in an iterative search using BESA software. The best model explained over 98% of the scalp variability (Figure 6E). Concluding that iGBR can be accounted for by the pattern of saccades, the question turns into whether and how different conditions shown to affect the iGBR may influence the pattern of saccades. The above analysis indicated that the presence of saccades is the major determinant of the strength of gamma magnitude at the single-trial level. Thus, conditions that elicit more or fewer saccades will induce, on average, stronger or weaker iGBR, respectively. Figure 7 shows indeed that there were fewer saccades in the Incoherent-30 than in the Incoherent-2 condition, whereas this difference is smaller and less consistent for the coherent conditions. This is congruent with the interaction reported for the iGBR in experiment 1 between the number of Bars and Coherence, and was replicated in experiment 2 [F(1,2) = 31.43, p < 0.05; subjects as random factor]. In addition to the number of saccades, specific saccadic characteristics may also influence the iGBR. For example, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) showed a significant effect of saccade amplitude on the iGBR [F(1,1198) = 122.24, p < 10−26]. These characteristics may vary depending on the condition: a larger saccade amplitude difference was found across the number of bars (2 versus 30) in the Incoherent conditions compared to the Coherent conditions (Figure 7). ANOVA with saccade amplitude (restricted to trials with detected saccades) as dependent variable, Bars and Coherence as fixed variables, and subjects as random variable confirmed this interaction [F(1,17) = 64.18, p < 10−6]. Figure 7 shows that this pattern was repeated in each individual subject. Further, examining the pattern of standard iGBR (i.e., including trials with and without saccades) suggested a reliable correspondence between the iGBR and the weighted average of saccade amplitudes, combining the saccade amplitude and the proportion of saccade trials in each condition (Figure 7). Thus, the variability of the iGBR as a function of condition could be accounted for by the effect of condition on saccades. The iGBR elicited in our experiments by partially masked stimuli replicated in every aspect (latency, frequency band, topography) the iGBR reported previously by us and in many other studies using intact stimuli (Busch et al., 2006Busch N.A.

Nevertheless, we conducted a third experiment testing four more subjects with the same stimuli used in the first two experiments, but without any masking. In this experiment, we also presented pictures of faces and watches that were previously used for an iGBR study (Zion-Golumbic and Bentin, 2007Zion-Golumbic E. Bentin S.

The unmasked objects produced the same pattern of results reported above for the masked objects, including poststimulus modulation of saccade rate, tight correlation between saccade onset and spike latency (r > 0.75, p < 10−5 for all subjects), a typical SRP (Figure S5), and the conspicuous difference between trials with and without saccades (Figure 8). A mixed-design ANCOVA of the iGBR in the 200–300 ms, 30–100 Hz window, with saccade amplitude as a continuous variable and subjects as a random factor, confirmed a significant effect of saccades [F(1,316) = 62.26, p < 10−13]. At the individual level, no subject elicited a significant iGBR enhancement compared to the baseline for trials with no saccades, whereas all but one subject elicited a significant increase for trials with saccades (paired t tests, p < 0.05).

We identified 2770 interactions among 1124 endogenously expressed proteins. Comparison with previous studies confirmed known interactions, but most were not known, revealing a previously unexplored subspace of the yeast protein interactome.

Each protein was tested in a suite of assays that measured metabolic, growth, or transcriptional responses in diverse cell types. The pattern of responses across assays was analyzed for the degree of functional selectivity of each protein. One of the highly selective proteins was a previously undescribed ligand, designated interleukin-34 (IL-34), which stimulates monocyte viability but does not affect responses in a wide spectrum of other assays. In a separate functional screen, we used a collection of extracellular domains of transmembrane proteins to discover the receptor for IL-34, which was a known cytokine receptor, colony-stimulating factor 1 (also called macrophage colony-stimulating factor) receptor. This systematic approach is thus useful for discovering new ligands and receptors and assessing the functional selectivity of extracellular regulatory proteins."

All of the physiological characteristics of qE have been positively correlated with charge transfer between coupled chlorophyll and zeaxanthin molecules in the light-harvesting antenna of photosystem II (PSII). We found evidence for charge-transfer quenching in all three of the individual minor antenna complexes of PSII (CP29, CP26, and CP24), and we conclude that charge-transfer quenching in CP29 involves a delocalized state of an excitonically coupled chlorophyll dimer. We propose that reversible conformational changes in CP29 can “tune” the electronic coupling between the chlorophylls in this dimer, thereby modulating the energy of the chlorophyll-zeaxanthin charge-transfer state and switching on and off the charge-transfer quenching during qE."

https://openalex.org/W2162760938,"Despite two centuries of effort in characterizing environmental gradients of species richness in search of universal patterns, surprisingly few of these patterns have been widely acknowledged. Species richness along altitudinal gradients was previously assumed to increase universally from cool highlands to warm lowlands, mirroring the latitudinal increase in species richness from cool to warm latitudes. However, since the more recent general acceptance of altitudinal gradients as model templates for testing hypotheses behind large-scale patterns of diversity, these gradients have been used in support of all the main diversity hypotheses, although little consensus has been achieved. Here we show that when resampling a data set comprising 400,000 records for 3,046 Pyrenean floristic species at different scales of analysis (achieved by varying grain size and the extent of the gradients sampled), the derived species richness pattern changed progressively from hump-shaped to a monotonic pattern as the scale of extent diminished. Scale effects alone gave rise to as many conflicting patterns of species richness as had previously been reported in the literature, and scale effects lent significantly different statistical support to competing diversity hypotheses. Effects of scale on current studies may be affected by human activities, because montane ecosystems and human activities are intimately connected. This interdependence has led to a global reduction in natural lowland habitats, hampering our ability to detect universal patterns and impeding the search for universal diversity gradients to discover the mechanisms determining the distribution of biological diversity on Earth."

These data suggest that striatal PANs promote the selection of valuable actions by modulating activity in the thalamus and midbrain. However, in the oculomotor caudate, a nucleus of the striatum, it is not known how the activity of PANs reflects the values of actions during choice behavior. Simultaneous measurements of striatal activity and estimates of subjective values would thus be useful for testing whether PANs encode a subject's estimates of the values of actions. In addition, such measurements would allow us to more precisely define the types of value-related information these neurons encode. PANs could, for example, encode action-values, the values associated with potential actions. Basal ganglia models often posit that striatal PANs encode a quantity like action-value that biases the selection of actions associated with more valuable outcomes (Doya, 2000Doya K. Complementary roles of basal ganglia and cerebellum in learning and motor control.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 732-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Alternatively, striatal PANs could encode chosen-values, the value of the option the decision-maker selects (Morris et al., 2006Morris G. Nevet A. Arkadir D. Vaadia E. Bergman H. Midbrain dopamine neurons encode decisions for future action.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006Padoa-Schioppa C. Assad J.A. Neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex encode economic value.Nature. 2006; 441: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). A neuron encoding chosen-value cannot support action selection because its activity is contingent on the action ultimately executed. Chosen-value representations may be useful for evaluating the outcomes of actions to promote learning (Morris et al., 2006Morris G. Nevet A. Arkadir D. Vaadia E. Bergman H. Midbrain dopamine neurons encode decisions for future action.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, Niv et al., 2006Niv Y. Daw N.D. Dayan P. Choice values.Nat.

The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998Google Scholar) or modifying movements to reflect the value of the action (e.g., reaction time). Do PANs in the oculomotor caudate reflect one or both of these value representations when animals choose among actions associated with changing reward values? To answer this question, we recorded from PANs in the oculomotor caudate while monkeys performed a choice task that elicited matching behavior (Herrnstein, 1961Herrnstein R.J. Relative and absolute strength of response as a function of frequency of reinforcement.J. Exp. Anal. Behav. 1961; 4: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). We estimated the action-values and chosen-values associated with each action both at the level of the sequential blocks of trials presented to the monkeys as well as at the level of individual choices and used these estimates to determine whether PANs tracked action-values or chosen-values. We found that the activity of a significant number of PANs was correlated with action-values and that the activity of a second group of PANs was correlated with chosen-values. Action-value-related activity was more prominent prior to movement execution, while chosen-value-related activity was more prominent following movement execution. These results support the idea that some striatal neurons bias action selection and provide evidence that a second novel group of striatal neurons may have an evaluative role, reporting the reward values associated with chosen actions. We recorded from PANs in the caudate nucleus of monkeys performing an oculomotor choice task where the values of the two available alternatives varied (Figure 1A). The choice task was based on the concurrent variable-interval schedules used to study Herrnstein's matching law (Herrnstein, 1961Herrnstein R.J. Relative and absolute strength of response as a function of frequency of reinforcement.J. Exp. Anal. Behav. 1961; 4: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar), which describes how many animals, including humans, choose among alternatives that differ in value (Davison and McCarthy, 1988Davison M. McCarthy D. The Matching Law: A Research Review. Erlbaum, Hillsdale, NJ1988Google Scholar, Williams, 1988Williams B. Reinforcement, choice, and response strength.in: Atkinson R.C. Herrnstein R.J. Lindzey G. Luce R.D. Stevens's Handbook of Experimental Psychology. Second edition. Wiley, New York1988: 167-244Google Scholar). Monkeys allocate their choices in proportion to the relative probability or magnitude of rewards in this type of task (Corrado et al., 2005Corrado G.S. Sugrue L.P. Seung H.S. Newsome W.T. Linear-nonlinear-poisson models of primate choice dynamics.J. Exp. Anal. Behav. 2005; 84: 581-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, Lau and Glimcher, 2005Lau B. Glimcher P.W. Dynamic response-by-response models of matching behavior in rhesus monkeys.J. Exp. Anal. Behav. 2005; 84: 555-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Here, we varied the relative magnitude of rewards in blocks of roughly 130 trials while keeping the average probabilities of reward for each alternative equal. Once a reward was arranged for an alternative, it remained available until it was next chosen, similar to the reinforcement schedules used to elicit matching behavior in free operant experiments (Nevin, 1969Nevin J. Interval reinforcement of choice behavior in discrete trials.J. Exp. Anal. Behav. 1969; 12: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We found that monkeys matched their choices to the relative magnitude of rewards obtained from each alternative (Figure 1B). Moreover, their choice behavior following transitions to different relative magnitudes of reward quickly stabilized (Figure 1C). These results contrast with the behavior animals exhibit under variable-ratio schedules, where rewards are not held between choices; under those contingencies, animals often learn to exclusively choose the better alternative, with little or no variation in relative choice as a function of the relative value of that alternative (Herrnstein and Vaughan, 1980Herrnstein R.J. Vaughan W. Melioration and behavioral allocation.in: Staddon J. Limits to Action: The Allocation of Individual Behavior. Academic Press, New York1980: 143-176Crossref Google Scholar, Samejima et al., 2005Samejima K. Ueda Y. Doya K. Kimura M. Representation of action-specific reward values in the striatum.Science. 2005; 310: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). That choice was lawfully related to relative reward magnitude during matching indicates that the monkeys acquired and maintained information about the consequences of their actions. This is consistent with the idea that their choices were based on the relative values they placed on the two actions. We hypothesized that caudate PANs encode the values associated with specific actions. However, a correlation between neuronal activity and value does not necessarily mean that a neuron participates in the action selection. Identifying neurons that could be related to action selection requires distinguishing between what we term action-value and chosen-value. The difference between these two value representations is illustrated in Figure 2A. Action-values represent the potential outcomes available to the decision-maker and can be used to select actions associated with these outcomes. Chosen-values cannot support action selection because they do not unambiguously reflect the value of one of the available actions. However, neurons encoding chosen-values may be useful for both evaluating and executing chosen actions. Hypothetical responses of action-value or chosen-value neurons are illustrated in Figure 2B, where the responses are separated by the action chosen and whether the contralateral action-value was greater than the ipsilateral action-value. Action-value neurons reflect the value associated with a particular action irrespective of which action is selected. Chosen-value neurons, on the other hand, reflect the reward value associated with the selected action. Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006Padoa-Schioppa C. Assad J.A. Neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex encode economic value.Nature. 2006; 441: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar first noted chosen-value activity in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), where they found that OFC chosen-value neurons encoded the chosen-value of whichever option was selected. It is important to note that the fundamental property of chosen-value activity is value sensitivity that depends on choice. Thus, the hypothetical chosen-value neuron illustrated in Figure 2B is only one of the possible types of chosen-value neuron. For example, another chosen-value neuron might respond most for contralateral choices only when that action is most valuable (high response in upper-left quadrant) but be insensitive to the value of the ipsilateral target when it is chosen (low response in all other quadrants). Both because movement selectivity is common in the caudate nucleus and because we had no a priori reason to exclude the possibility that different types of chosen-value neurons might occur, we tested the possibility that different types of chosen-value neurons might be found in the striatum. We used the programmed reward magnitudes set by the reinforcement schedule to generate estimates of the chosen-values and action-values for each session (Figure 2A), which we refer to as blockwise value estimates. Although these value estimates do not vary from trial to trial as the animals' internal estimates probably do, they have the advantage of being essentially model free. Individual PANs were active at idiosyncratic and highly repeatable times during each trial (Hikosaka et al., 1989aHikosaka O. Sakamoto M. Usui S. Functional properties of monkey caudate neurons. I. activities related to saccadic eye movements.J. Neurophysiol. 1989; 61: 780-798PubMed Google Scholar, Hikosaka et al., 1989bHikosaka O. Sakamoto M. Usui S.

Glimcher P.W. Action and outcome encoding in the primate caudate nucleus.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 14502-14514Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To analyze this activity, we identified the time of peak activity for each neuron and used the first times to half-maximal response preceding and following this peak to define an analysis window. We used multiple linear regression including blockwise value estimates as covariates to categorize individual neurons into three exclusive populations: (1) nonvalue, (2) action-value, or (3) chosen-value. We also refer to nonvalue neurons that responded differentially according to movement direction as choice-only (Figure 2B). Example neurons categorized as action-value and chosen-value are plotted in Figures 3A–3D. For each category, the firing rates for two example PANs are plotted in each row, sorted by chosen action and whether the contralateral action-value was greater than the ipsilateral action-value. Both example action-value neurons are more active when the reward associated with the contralateral target is larger than that associated with the ipsilateral target; however, the neuron in Figure 3A exhibits this difference before the onset of the choice cues, whereas the neuron in Figure 3B exhibits this difference after the onset of the choice cues. The two example chosen-value neurons (Figures 3C and 3D) are more active when the ipsilateral target is chosen and that target is associated with the larger reward. In contrast to action-value neurons, the neuron in Figure 3C is also more active when the contralateral target is chosen and that target is associated with the larger reward; this neuron reflects the value of whichever action was selected. The neuron in Figure 3D also differs from action-value neurons; its activity reflects the value of the ipsilateral action when it is chosen (p < 0.05, t test) but does not reflect value when the contralateral action is chosen (p > 0.10, t test). Figures 3E and 3F display neurons that were direction selective (p < 0.05, F test) but not value sensitive (p > 0.05, t test). The examples in Figures 3A–3D show that different neurons can encode value at different points in a trial, from before cue presentation to after saccade execution. They are also representative in illustrating that neurons sensitive to value can exhibit additive changes in firing rate due to choice (Figure 3B). We included a number of additional covariates in our regression analysis to protect against potential confounds: the direction, latency, and speed of movements (Itoh et al., 2003Itoh H. Nakahara H. Hikosaka O. Kawagoe R. Takikawa Y. Aihara K. Correlation of primate caudate neural activity and saccade parameters in reward-oriented behavior.J.

The parameters for these additional covariates were estimated alongside the value covariates and summarized in Table 1. A significant number of PANs encoded information about choice (i.e., movement direction) and obtained reward in addition to value (Table 1).Table 1Regression Summary Broken Down by Value RepresentationTotalChoiceReaction TimePeak VelocityObtained RewardAction-value3631 (86%)11 (31%)13 (36%)9 (25%)Chosen-value2612 (46%)7 (27%)2 (8%)13 (50%)Nonvalue3829 (76%)9 (24%)6 (15%)12 (31%)10072272134The percentages listed in parentheses are relative to the row total.

We found that 62% of task-related PANs covaried significantly with action-value or chosen-value (p < 0.05, F test). To summarize the regression analysis and examine how substantially value influenced neuronal activity, we quantified the magnitude of firing rate changes due to changes in value. For each neuron, we subtracted from the raw firing rate on each trial the predicted effect due to all variables except value. This partial residual isolates the effect of value on firing rate by holding constant the effects due to all other covariates. We then averaged the partial residuals across trials and neurons for each category. Because neurons could increase or decrease firing rates in response to value, we altered the sign of the effect for each neuron so that the mean effect for all neurons increased for increasing contralateral value. To facilitate comparisons with hypothetical responses (Figure 2B), we computed separate averages according to the chosen action as well as to whether the contralateral action-value was greater than the ipsilateral action-value (Figure 4A). Figure 4A also shows the mean effects for nonvalue neurons, further separated into choice-only neurons (partial residuals computed for choice rather than value) and neurons that did not respond differentially to choice (partial residuals computed for value). The choice-only neurons are a useful reference because some PANs respond selectively during saccade execution; the quadrant plot in Figure 4A shows a contralateral bias in these neurons, which has been observed in the caudate (Hikosaka et al., 1989aHikosaka O. Sakamoto M. Usui S. Functional properties of monkey caudate neurons. I. activities related to saccadic eye movements.J. Neurophysiol. 1989; 61: 780-798PubMed Google Scholar), and provides a scale against which the effects of value can be compared. At the population level, blockwise variations in reward value change firing rates by approximately the same amount as changes in firing rate due to different saccade directions. These results indicate that a significant number of PANs were correlated with the reward value associated with particular actions. To further explore the differences between action-value and chosen-value neurons we examined the partial residuals for individual neurons in each category. We computed an index based on the mean effects used to generate the average quadrant plots in Figure 4A by summing the absolute values of the row-wise differences of the quadrant plot for each neuron. This is a simple summary of the column asymmetry of the quadrant plot for each neuron, which reflects the degree to which a neuron with value sensitivity exhibits a dependence on the chosen action. Action-value neurons should produce column asymmetry indices close to zero, whereas chosen-value neurons should produce column asymmetry indices greater than zero (Figure 2B). Note, however, that it is possible for chosen-value neurons to exhibit smaller asymmetry indices for weaker correlations with chosen-value. Figure 4B displays the asymmetry index for each neuron separated by value representation. The distributions for action-value neurons and chosen-value neurons show relatively little overlap, supporting the distinction between these value representations. Also illustrated in Figure 4B are those chosen-value neurons that had significant coefficients for both chosen-values. We found that, unlike neurons in the OFC (Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006Padoa-Schioppa C. Assad J.A. Neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex encode economic value.Nature. 2006; 441: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar), 58% (15/26) of chosen-value PANs in the caudate were significantly correlated with the chosen-value of only one action, while the remaining 42% (11/26) were significantly correlated with the chosen-values of both actions (p < 0.05, t test for both chosen-values). Thus, chosen-value PANs in the caudate are not homogeneous, although both of these types of chosen-value neuron are distinct from action-value neurons. In the analysis above, we used the blockwise reward magnitudes to approximate the monkeys' internal value estimates. While simple, this approach has two limitations: (1) it ignores the behavioral dynamics that occur within a block, and (2) while it allows us to identify action-value neurons, we cannot distinguish positive covariation with the contralateral action-value from negative covariation with the ipsilateral action-value. This ambiguity arises because the two reward magnitudes available to the monkeys in each block summed to a constant value by design in our experiment (see Experimental Procedures). We addressed both of these limitations by developing trial-by-trial estimates of the subjects' internal valuations for each action from the monkeys' choice behavior. To accomplish this, we fit a reinforcement learning model to choice behavior to generate dynamic value estimates for each action (cf. Barraclough et al., 2004Barraclough D.J. Conroy M.L. Lee D.

Kimura M. Representation of action-specific reward values in the striatum.Science. 2005; 310: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). We used these estimates to further explore the categorization we arrived at using the blockwise value estimates described above and to extend our observations by examining whether action-value and chosen-value neurons covary with value estimates on a trial-by-trial basis. Our behavioral model had three terms (Lau and Glimcher, 2005Lau B. Glimcher P.W. Dynamic response-by-response models of matching behavior in rhesus monkeys.J. Exp. Anal. Behav. 2005; 84: 555-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar): (1) a linearly weighted sum of past rewards, (2) the magnitude of each of the currently available rewards, and (3) a linearly weighted sum of past choices. We have shown that this model accurately captures fluctuations in behavior driven by stochastic reward delivery in our matching task (Lau and Glimcher, 2005Lau B. Glimcher P.W. Dynamic response-by-response models of matching behavior in rhesus monkeys.J. Exp. Anal. Behav. 2005; 84: 555-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The function of the first term is to identify the weight a subject places on each previous reward as a function of how long ago that reward was received. In practice, we have found that this linear weighting function on rewards takes an exponentially decaying form with recent rewards most strongly influencing current value estimates. This is what would be expected if the monkeys used a simple prediction-error learning rule to estimate the value of each alternative (e.g., Bayer and Glimcher, 2005Bayer H. Glimcher P. Midbrain dopamine neurons encode a quantitative reward prediction error signal.Neuron. 2005; 47: 129-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). The second term simply encodes the magnitude of the rewards available in each block of trials and allows the model to predict a simple bias (across the block) for the action associated with a larger reward. The third term captures the influence of previous choices on a current choice. In practice, this linear weighting on past choices captures features like the strong tendency of monkeys to alternate actions independent of rewards. Importantly, incorporating past choices into our behavioral model allowed us to accurately estimate the behavioral influence of past rewards and currently available rewards. Furthermore, we are able to separate the behavioral effects of reward value (first two model terms) from those of past choices (third term), which allowed us to test the hypothesis that PANs encode the dynamic action-values and chosen-values associated with the available choice alternatives. We used the coefficients from this behavioral model related to reward value (the first two terms described in the preceding paragraph)—fit separately to the choice data pooled across sessions for each monkey—to generate dynamic reward-value estimates associated with each alternative (Figure 5A). These estimates represent the fluctuating subjective preferences of the monkeys due to stochastic rewards and are directly related to the probability that the subject will make a particular choice on each trial. In a manner similar to the blockwise value estimate analysis described above, we constructed dynamic action-values and dynamic chosen-values for each alternative. We then performed a second regression for each neuron of the type described in the previous section, where we used the trial-by-trial estimates of action-value and chosen-value instead of the blockwise estimates (see Experimental Procedures). We used the neuronal categorizations from the blockwise analysis above to determine whether to correlate the activity of a particular neuron with dynamic estimates of action-value or chosen-va"

It is expressed at high levels in mouse embryonic stem cells but its function has not been understood. Now Singh et al. show that REST/NRSF is an element in the transcriptional network maintaining stem cell 'stemness'. It maintains self-renewal and pluripotency by blocking the expression of a microRNA that inhibits stem cell self-renewal and prompts them to differentiate into specific cell types. This paper demonstrates that a simple, neutral metacommunity model successfully predicts large-scale patterns of fish diversity in the Mississippi–Missouri Basin River System. River networks, seen as ecological corridors featuring connected and hierarchical dendritic landscapes for animals and plants, present unique challenges and opportunities for testing biogeographical theories and macroecological laws1. Although local and basin-scale differences in riverine fish diversity have been analysed as functions of energy availability and habitat heterogeneity2, scale-dependent environmental conditions3 and river discharge4,5, a model that predicts a comprehensive set of system-wide diversity patterns has been hard to find. Here we show that fish diversity patterns throughout the Mississippi–Missouri River System are well described by a neutral metacommunity model coupled with an appropriate habitat capacity distribution and dispersal kernel. River network structure acts as an effective template for characterizing spatial attributes of fish biodiversity. We show that estimates of average dispersal behaviour and habitat capacities, objectively calculated from average runoff production, yield reliable predictions of large-scale spatial biodiversity patterns in riverine systems. The success of the neutral theory in two-dimensional forest ecosystems6,7,8 and here in dendritic riverine ecosystems suggests the possible application of neutral metacommunity models in a diverse suite of ecosystems. This framework offers direct linkage from large-scale forcing, such as global climate change, to biodiversity patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2043479930,"The term 'molecular magnet' generally refers to a molecular entity containing several magnetic ions whose coupled spins generate a collective spin, S (ref. 1). Such complex multi-spin systems provide attractive targets for the study of quantum effects at the mesoscopic scale. In these molecules, the large energy barriers between collective spin states can be crossed by thermal activation or quantum tunnelling, depending on the temperature or an applied magnetic field. There is the hope that these mesoscopic spin states can be harnessed for the realization of quantum bits--'qubits', the basic building blocks of a quantum computer--based on molecular magnets. But strong decoherence must be overcome if the envisaged applications are to become practical. Here we report the observation and analysis of Rabi oscillations (quantum oscillations resulting from the coherent absorption and emission of photons driven by an electromagnetic wave) of a molecular magnet in a hybrid system, in which discrete and well-separated magnetic clusters are embedded in a self-organized non-magnetic environment. Each cluster contains 15 antiferromagnetically coupled S = 1/2 spins, leading to an S = 1/2 collective ground state. When this system is placed into a resonant cavity, the microwave field induces oscillatory transitions between the ground and excited collective spin states, indicative of long-lived quantum coherence. The present observation of quantum oscillations suggests that low-dimension self-organized qubit networks having coherence times of the order of 100 micros (at liquid helium temperatures) are a realistic prospect."
https://openalex.org/W1971552826,"It is a central tenet of cochlear neurobiology that mammalian ears rely on a local, mechanical amplification process for their high sensitivity and sharp frequency selectivity. While it is generally agreed that outer hair cells provide the amplification, two mechanisms have been proposed: stereociliary motility and somatic motility. The latter is driven by the motor protein prestin. Electrophysiological phenotyping of a prestin knockout mouse intimated that somatic motility is the amplifier. However, outer hair cells of knockout mice have significantly altered mechanical properties, making this mouse model unsatisfactory. Here, we study a mouse model without alteration to outer hair cell and organ of Corti mechanics or to mechanoelectric transduction, but with diminished prestin function. These animals have knockout-like behavior, demonstrating that prestin-based electromotility is required for cochlear amplification.

These animals have knockout-like behavior, demonstrating that prestin-based electromotility is required for cochlear amplification. In the mammalian cochlea, it is assumed that outer hair cells (OHC) are the amplifiers and that inner hair cells (IHC) are passive detectors of the amplified vibratory signal (e.g., Dallos, 1992Dallos P. The active cochlea.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4575-4585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This assumption has a long history that began with chemical ablation of OHCs and demonstration of significant effects on hearing threshold (Ryan and Dallos, 1975Ryan A.F. Dallos P. Absence of cochlear outer hair cells: Effect on behavioural auditory threshold.Nature. 1975; 253: 44-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and frequency selectivity (Dallos and Harris, 1978Dallos P. Harris D.M. Properties of auditory nerve responses in the absence of outer hair cells.J. Neurophysiol. 1978; 41: 365-383PubMed Google Scholar). Crawford and Fettiplace, 1985Crawford A.C.

Both reports engendered follow-up, with somatic motility enjoying broader support as the principal mechanism of amplification in mammals. However, two recent publications (Chan and Hudspeth, 2005Chan D. Hudspeth A.J. Ca2+ current-driven nonlinear amplification by the mammalian cochlea in vitro.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, Kennedy et al., 2005Kennedy H.J. Crawford A.C. Fettiplace R. Force generation by mammalian hair bundles supports a role in cochlear amplification.Nature. 2005; 433: 880-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and their numerous antecedents, appear to support the ciliary mechanism (Hudspeth, 1997Hudspeth A.J. How hearing happens.Neuron. 1997; 19: 947-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The need for amplification is sought in the highly damped nature of the cochlear partition, which, without some boost, would not permit sharply tuned, sensitive operation (Gold, 1948Gold T. Hearing II: the physical basis of the action of the cochlea.Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1948; 135: 492-498Crossref Google Scholar). Consequently, a process is required to counteract the damping by injecting mechanical energy on a cycle-by-cycle basis (Neely and Kim, 1983Neely S.T. Kim D.O. An active cochlear model showing sharp tuning and high sensitivity.Hear. Res. 1983; 9: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, DeBoer, 1986DeBoer E. Mechanics of the cochlea: Modeling efforts.in: Dallos P. Popper A.N. Fay R.R. The Cochlea. Springer, New York1986: 258-317Google Scholar). Because tuning curves obtained from single auditory nerve fibers are similar to those recorded at the basilar membrane (Narayan et al., 1998Narayan S.S. Temchin A.N. Recio A. Ruggero M.A. Frequency tuning of basilar membrane and auditory nerve fibers in the same cochlea.Science. 1998; 282: 1882-1884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this amplifier process must influence all elements of the coupled cochlear mechanical system. Thus, it is not sufficient for the amplifier to operate on the mechanoelectric transducer (MET) channels alone, i.e., its operation must be reflected in the vibration of all components, including the basilar membrane. This requirement dictates that there be an adequate mechanical impedance match between the amplifier and its load. If the stiffness of a constituent mechanical element (such as the OHC) changes, so does its impedance, and, consequently, a match is no longer obtained, resulting in decreased amplification. OHC somatic electromotility is powered by the novel motor protein prestin (SLC26A5: Zheng et al., 2000Zheng J. Shen W. He D.Z.Z. Long K. Madison L.D. Dallos P. Prestin is the motor protein of cochlear outer hair cells.Nature. 2000; 405: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). OHCs isolated from the prestin-KO mouse were not motile, and the electrophysiological phenotype was consistent with the lack of amplification (Liberman et al., 2002Liberman M.C. Gao J.G. He D.Z.Z. Wu X.D. Jia S.P. Zuo J. Prestin is required for electromotility of the outer hair cell and for the cochlear amplifier.Nature. 2002; 419: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Despite normal appearance of hair bundles (Wu et al., 2004Wu X.D. Gao J.G. Guo Y.K. Zuo J. Hearing threshold elevation precedes hair-cell loss in prestin knockout m ice.Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2004; 126: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and expression of candidate ciliary-motor proteins (Liberman et al., 2002Liberman M.C. Gao J.G. He D.Z.Z. Wu X.D. Jia S.P. Zuo J. Prestin is required for electromotility of the outer hair cell and for the cochlear amplifier.Nature. 2002; 419: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), there was insufficient evidence as to the integrity of the forward transduction mechanism. Subsequently, forward transduction was shown to be normal in the KO mouse model, supporting the dominant role of somatic motility in amplification (Cheatham et al., 2004Cheatham M.A. Huynh K.H. Gao J. Zuo J. Dallos P. Cochlear function in Prestin knockout mice.J. Physiol. 2004; 560: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, Jia and He, 2005Jia S. He D.Z.Z. Motility-associated hair-bundle motion in mammalian outer hair cells.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1028-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although this body of work was suggestive, confounding features indicated a need for caution, including the shorter OHC length (∼60% of normal; Liberman et al., 2002Liberman M.C. Gao J.G. He D.Z.Z. Wu X.D. Jia S.P. Zuo J. Prestin is required for electromotility of the outer hair cell and for the cochlear amplifier.Nature. 2002; 419: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, Cheatham et al., 2004Cheatham M.A. Huynh K.H.

Neurootol. 2007; 12: 378-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), intimating the possibility of abnormal cochlear micromechanics. Given the importance to amplification of impedance matching of the amplifier to its cochlear load, a significant change in the mechanical load could simulate the no-amplification phenotype. As previous studies of the KO did not examine mechanical integrity, the behavior of the prestin KO mouse cannot be unequivocally assigned to a lack of amplification via somatic motility. As a result, a different model is needed. To further examine the role of prestin in cochlear amplification, we created a prestin knockin (KI) mouse in which 2 residues were replaced (V499G/Y501H; Figure 1A; for simplicity, the altered molecule is referred to as “499” and the V499G/Y501H knockin mouse as “KI”) near the presumed junction between the last transmembrane domain and the intracellular C terminus. Choice of these substitutions was based on earlier studies (Zheng et al., 2005Zheng J. Du G.G. Matsuda K. Orem A. Aguiñaga S. Deák L. Navarrete E. Madison L.D. Dallos P. The C-terminus of prestin influences nonlinear capacitance and plasma membrane targeting.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2987-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), showing that 499 mutant prestin is targeted to the plasma membrane but displays significantly diminished functional characteristics, i.e., nonlinear capacitance (NLC). NLC reflects electromotility-related charge displacement in OHCs and is commonly used to assess motor function (Ashmore, 1990Ashmore J.F. Forward and reverse transduction in the mammalian cochlea.Neurosci. Res. Suppl. 1990; 12: S39-S50Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, Santos-Sacchi, 1991Santos-Sacchi J. Reversible inhibition of voltage-dependent outer hair cell motility and capacitance.J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3096-3110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although 499 homozygous mice suffer progressive OHC loss in the basal cochlear turn, individual OHCs have normal lengths (WT: 15.4 ± 0.62 mm; 499: 15.1 ± 1.1 mm; n = 30 each, measured ∼500 μm from the base of the cochlea; Student's t test, p = 0.15). We also measured OHC somatic stiffness in cells derived from KI, WT, and KO mice. As shown in Figure 1B, a calibrated glass fiber is positioned against the cuticular plate of an OHC with ∼80% of its length extruded from a microchamber. Measurements of axial stiffness (Figure 1C) indicate that OHCs from WT and 499 mice are equally stiff. We tested this similarity with the “two regression lines” test (Tsutakawa and Hewett, 1978Tsutakawa R.K. Hewett J.E. Comparison of 2 regression lines over a finite interval.Biometrics. 1978; 34: 391-398Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Regressions representing the two populations (KI and WT) are not statistically different (p = 0.27). In contrast, regressions of both WT and KI are significantly different from that of the KO, with the somatic stiffness of OHCs derived from KO mice between one-fourth and one-third that of WT controls. These findings yield two important conclusions. First, inasmuch as OHCs of KI mice are mechanically similar to those of WT, the KI is appropriate for assessing prestin-based amplifier function. Second, the KO is not a usable model to test the importance of prestin-based electromotility in cochlear amplification. Because mutations in prestin often cause protein misfolding and interfere with proper membrane targeting (Zheng et al., 2005Zheng J. Du G.G. Matsuda K. Orem A. Aguiñaga S. Deák L. Navarrete E. Madison L.D. Dallos P. The C-terminus of prestin influences nonlinear capacitance and plasma membrane targeting.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2987-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, He et al., 2006He D.Z.Z. Zheng J. Kalinec F. Kakehata S. Santos-Sacchi J. Tuning in the amazing outer hair cell: Membrane wizardry with a twist and shout.J. Membr. Biol. 2006; 209: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we compared wild-type and mutant prestin protein expression patterns in cochleae derived from WT and KI mice using immunofluorescence. For each genotype, one cochlea was treated with Triton X-100 to permeabilize the plasma membrane. As shown in Figure 2A, cochleae derived from WT and KI mice have similar prestin staining patterns (demonstrated with anti-C-mPres). Immunofluorescence is only observed with Triton X-100 pretreatment, suggesting that the C terminus of the 499 mutant protein is located inside cells as with the WT. The typical “ring” staining pattern of OHCs observed in organ of Corti samples suggests that prestin and mutant prestin are restricted to the lateral membrane of OHCs. Similar results were also found with anti-N-mPres. In addition, we investigated the oligomeric status (Zheng et al., 2006Zheng J. Du G.G. Anderson C.T. Keller J.P. Orem A. Dallos P. Cheatham M.A. Analysis of the oligomeric structure of the motor protein prestin.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19916-19924Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) of mutant prestin. Similar to WT, 499 prestin forms monomers and dimers, and the dimer bands disappear after pretreatment with the reducing reagent ethanedithiol (Figure 2B). There is no statistical difference between WT and 499-prestin in the amounts of monomer and dimer, or their ratio (Figure 2C). In combination, these results suggest that 499 KI mice possess normal cochlear/OHC structural and mechanical properties. As shown in Figures 3A and 3B, OHCs derived from 499 animals express significantly reduced nonlinear capacitance and electromotility compared to WT littermates. It also appears that the mutation induces a large positive-direction shift in both NLC and motility, with a concomitant reduction in response magnitude around the OHC resting potential. While the saturated motile and NLC responses cannot be reached in the 499 OHCs (due to membrane breakdown at very large depolarized membrane potentials), they appear to be small. This behavior recapitulates that seen with severe reduction of intracellular chloride (Rybalchenko and Santos-Sacchi, 2003Rybalchenko V. Santos-Sacchi J. Cl-flux through a non-selective, stretch-sensitive conductance influences the outer hair cell motor of the guinea pig.J. Physiol. 2003; 547: 873-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). More importantly, at the putative in vivo membrane potential of −70 mV (Dallos, 1985Dallos P. Response characteristics of mammalian cochlear hair cells.J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 1591-1608PubMed Google Scholar, Russell and Sellick, 1983Russell I.J. Sellick P.M. Low-frequency characteristics of intracellularly recorded receptor potentials in guinea-pig cochlear hair cells.J. Physiol. 1983; 338: 179-206PubMed Google Scholar), the slope of the average motility function changes from 7.10 nm/mV (WT) to 0.53 nm/mV (499 KI). Thus, the gain of amplification based on somatic motility is on average 7.5% of normal. From the model proposed by Patuzzi, 1996Patuzzi R. Cochlear micromechanics and macromechanics.in: Dallos P. Popper A.N. Fay R.R. The Cochlea. Springer, New York1996: 186-257Crossref Google Scholar, the expected threshold shift based on the 7.5% gain is ∼54.5 dB, which is indistinguishable from that exhibited by KO animals (Cheatham et al., 2004Cheatham M.A. Huynh K.H. Gao J. Zuo J. Dallos P. Cochlear function in Prestin knockout mice.J. Physiol. 2004; 560: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In order to assess the contribution of prestin-based somatic electromotility to cochlear amplification, it is essential to demonstrate that MET channel function, the basis of ciliary motility, is intact. Accordingly, we demonstrate that MET currents are wild-type like, strongly suggesting that forward transduction is unaltered in these animals. In Figure 3C, two individual examples are shown for current traces measured in response to increasing sinusoidal displacements of the basilar membrane. Average (±SD) change in transducer current is depicted in Figure 3D (n = 5 each). The difference between the average behaviors was tested with ANOVA and found to be insignificant (F = 1.62, p = 0.24). Finally, Figure 3E demonstrates that fast adaptation, presumably intimately tied to stereociliary amplification (e.g., LeMasurier and Gillespie, 2005LeMasurier M. Gillespie P.G. Hair cell mechanotransduction and cochlear amplification.Neuron. 2005; 48: 403-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), is also indistinguishable from that seen in wild-type mice. For example, low-level average fast adaptation time constants are 0.120 ± 0.011 ms for WT (n = 5) and 0.120 ± 0.006 ms for 499 (n = 5) (t test: p = 0.62). All of the in vitro data shown thus far indicate that the 499 KI mice provide an ideal model for testing the hypothesis that prestin is required for cochlear amplification. Recordings of various indices of cochlear performance are shown in Figure 4. Included are compound action potential (CAP) threshold functions (Dallos et al., 1978Dallos P. Harris D.M. Özdamar Ö. Ryan A. Behavioral, compound action potential, and single unit thresholds: Relationship in normal and abnormal ears.J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 1978; 64: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, Johnstone et al., 1979Johnstone J.R. Alder V.A. Johnstone B.M. Cochlear action potential threshold and single unit thresholds.J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 1979; 65: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and CAP simultaneous masking tuning curves (Dallos and Cheatham, 1976Dallos P. Cheatham M.A. Compound action potential (AP) tuning curves.J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 1976; 59: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The first measure provides a description of hearing sensitivity, i.e., the CAP threshold curves reflect the animals' audiogram. The second index, CAP masking tuning curve, provides a measure of the threshold characteristics of a small group of auditory nerve fibers with similar characteristic frequencies, i.e., they provide an indication of frequency selectivity at the “output” of the cochlea. Figure 4A shows CAP thresholds for 499 and corresponding WT mice (average ± SD, n = 7 each). CAP threshold is defined as the sound pressure level at the eardrum required to produce a criterion magnitude CAP at a given frequency. The 499 animals show a large threshold shift compared to WT. As seen previously in KOs (Cheatham et al., 2004Cheatham M.A. Huynh K.H. Gao J. Zuo J. Dallos P. Cochlear function in Prestin knockout mice.J. Physiol. 2004; 560: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), mice lacking functional prestin exhibit a large change in sensitivity. In Figure 4B, the average difference between individual 499 threshold curves and the average WT threshold curve is given. Included for comparison is the average CAP threshold difference for prestin KO mice (n = 8) and their WT controls (n = 10). We note that the threshold shift changes from ∼30 dB at low frequencies to ∼55 dB at 27 kHz. The decrease at the highest frequencies is due to age-related hair cell loss, which produces high-frequency threshold shift even in WT animals (Figure 4A; shaded region). The apparent reversal at the lowest frequencies, where thresholds are determined by the tail-sensitivities of high-frequency fibers, is unexplained. An ANOVA to test for differences between 499 and KO resulted in an F ratio of 0.29 and p = 0.59. It is apparent that 499 KI and prestin KO threshold shifts are not statistically different. In addition, click auditory brainstem responses corroborate the CAP measurements (data not shown). Finally, in Figure 4C, CAP average (±SD) masking tuning curves are shown for 499 KI (n = 7) and WT (n = 5) mice. As in KO animals (Cheatham et al., 2004Cheatham M.A. Huynh K.H. Gao J. Zuo J. Dallos P. Cochlear function in Prestin knockout mice.J. Physiol. 2004; 560: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, Cheatham et al., 2007Cheatham M.A. Huynh K. Zheng J. Du G.G. Edge R.M. Anderson C.T. Ryan A.F. Zuo J. Dallos P. Evaluation of a prestin mouse model derived from the 129S1 strain.Audiol. Neurootol. 2007; 12: 378-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), tuning is absent in the 499 mice. Outer hair cell mediated mechanical amplification is a signal feature of the mammalian cochlea (e.g., Dallos, 1992Dallos P. The active cochlea.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4575-4585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in spite of extensive research, there is no general agreement as to the mechanism of amplification. In theory, either ciliary or somatic motility mechanisms could provide amplification in the mammal; which one does and in what manner is a central question of cochlear neurobiology. If cochlear amplification is explained by either ciliary or somatic processes, and one wishes to select between the two, the present results rule out ciliary amplification. Accordingly, prestin KI mice display their characteristic phenotype because they lack an amplifier and not because the micromechanical load on the ciliary amplifier is altered. Support for this statement comes from results reported here showing normal OHC length and stiffness, as well as normal MET function. Thus, one may surmise that, in spite of mechanical changes in OHCs lacking prestin, the KO mouse lacks sensitivity and frequency selectivity because amplification is absent and not because the mechanical properties of its OHCs are altered. Our recent study, using a different prestin KI model, is in line with this conclusion (Gao et al., 2007Gao J. Wang X. Wu X. Aguiñaga S. Huynh K. Matsuda K. Jia S. Patel M. Zheng J. Cheatham M.A. et al.Prestin-based outer hair cell electromotility in knockin mice does not appear to adjust the operating point of a cilia-based amplifier.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 12542-12547Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Alternatively, these two putative amplifier processes might cooperate (e.g., Fettiplace, 2006Fettiplace R. Active hair bundle movements in auditory hair cells.J. Physiol. (London). 2006; 576: 29-36Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In its most advanced form, this model envisions ciliary motility to be the amplifier, with somatic motility adjusting its operating point. The adjustment presumably minimizes the DC component of the OHC receptor potential by shifting the operating point of the mechanoelectric transducer via somatic-motility feedback. Supporting this schema is the observation that intracellular receptor potentials from OHCs in the high-frequency region of the cochlea reveal symmetrical AC responses with virtually no DC component up to high sound levels (Russell and Sellick, 1983Russell I.J. Sellick P.M. Low-frequency characteristics of intracellularly recorded receptor potentials in guinea-pig cochlear hair cells.J. Physiol. 1983; 338: 179-206PubMed Google Scholar, Cody and Russell, 1987Cody A.R. Russell I.J. The responses of hair cells in the basal turn of the guinea-pig cochlea to tones.J. Physiol. 1987; 383: 551-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). One problem with this argument is that using an alternative approach to intracellular recording from OHCs in vivo, well-developed DC responses are measured from the entire apical half of the cochlea, including regions where cochlear amplification is clearly operative (Dallos, 1985Dallos P. Response characteristics of mammalian cochlear hair cells.J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 1591-1608PubMed Google Scholar, Cheatham and Dallos, 1993Cheatham M.A. Dallos P. Longitudinal comparisons of IHC AC and DC receptor potentials recorded from the guinea-pig cochlea.Hear. Res. 1993; 68: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Hence, the existence or lack of a DC receptor potential throughout the cochlea is not conclusively established. Another potential problem with this notion is the universal presence of adaptation in all hair cell systems studied (e.g., Eatock, 2000Eatock R.A. Adaptation in hair cells.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 285-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Functionally, adaptation of the MET apparatus is a nonlinear high-pass filter, particularly effective at low input levels where amplification is maximal. As a high-pass filter, adaptation reduces the effectiveness of DC feedback from somatic motility to the MET transducer, i.e., the putative ciliary amplifier. Assuming separate functions for the two processes, we ask what role might be played by feedback mechanisms associated with the MET channels. MET channels function as amplifiers in hair cell systems of lower vertebrates (Hudspeth, 1997Hudspeth A.J. How hearing happens.Neuron. 1997; 19: 947-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, Manley, 2001Manley G.A. Evidence for an active process and a cochlear amplifier in nonmammals.J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 86: 541-549PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that ciliary processes may also tune the transducer current to cell-specific frequencies (Martin and Hudspeth, 1999Martin P. Hudspeth A.J. Active hair bundle movements can amplify a hair cell's response to oscillatory mechanical stimuli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 14306-14311Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In fact, in all models of ciliary feedback, tuning and amplification are intimately associated. It is possible that in mammals the reciprocal behavior of MET channels is principally represented by frequency tuning of the OHC transducer current, with the amplificatory behavior effectively squelched by the significant mechanical load. The latter is manifest by the need to displace the basilar membrane-tectorial membrane complex by forces generated in the MET channels. This putative inability, however, should not preclude tuning. One can envision a scheme whereby a division of labor is established between the ciliary (MET) process and prestin. The former tunes the transducer current so that in any hair cell only a relatively narrow, tonotopically arranged frequency band produces AC voltage gradients, thereby activating prestin motors, which are fully responsible for amplification. Although this dichotomy between tuning and amplification has been intimated before (Robles and Ruggero, 2001Robles L. Ruggero M.A. Mechanics of the mammalian cochlea.Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1305-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar), its clearest expression is given by Ricci, 2003Ricci A. Active hair bundle movements and the cochlear amplifier.J. Am. Acad. Audiol. 2003; 14: 325-338PubMed Google Scholar: “It is likely that OHC motility provides the mechanical positive feedback but that this feedback is tuned by some other component, namely the sensory hair bundle.” Recent demonstrations that voltage-induced bundle motion is, either fully (Jia and He, 2005Jia S. He D.Z.Z. Motility-associated hair-bundle motion in mammalian outer hair cells.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1028-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or at least in significant part (Kennedy et al., 2006Kennedy H. Evans M.G. Crawford A.C. Fettiplace R. Depolarization of cochlear outer hair cells evokes active hair bundle motion by two mechanisms.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2757-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), due to somatic motility support this possibility. Longitudinally graded OHC transducer currents and fast adaptation time constants also support the possibility of a location-specific cilia-based tuning mechanism (He et al., 2004He D.Z.Z. Jia S. Dallos P. Mechanoelectrical transduction of adult outer hair cells studied in the hemicochlea.Nature. 2004; 429: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, Ricci et al., 2005Ricci A.J. Kennedy H.J. Crawford A.C. Fettiplace R. The transduction channel filter in auditory hair cells.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7831-7839Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the reduction in driving force to somatic motility at high frequencies, due to attenuation of the AC receptor potential by filtering at the OHC's basolateral membrane, can be overcome in various ways (see Dallos et al., 2006Dallos P. Zheng J. Cheatham M.A. Prestin and the cochlear amplifier.J. Physiol. 2006; 576: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Finally, prestin's dominant role in amplification is supported by recent in vivo experiments (Santos-Sacchi et al., 2006Santos-Sacchi J. Song L. Zheng J.F. Nuttall A.L. Control of mammalian cochlear amplification by chloride ions.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3992-3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). If prestin developed in order to produce a DC adjustment to the operating point of the MET channel, as theories of cooperativity suggest, one might question the use of a novel protein for this purpose. What sets prestin apart from other biological motors is its direct voltage-to-displacement conversion process and its speed. The protein is capable of producing force at rates exceeding 70 kHz (Frank et al., 1999Frank G. Hemmert W. Gummer A.W. Limiting dynamics of high-frequency electromechanical transduction of outer hair cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 4420-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Hence, one asks what might be the evolutionary advantage of converting a sulfate transporter into a high-speed motor and then using it only at DC when conventional enzymatic motors could have fulfilled this role. It appears to us that assigning amplification to prestin and perhaps prefiltering to the MET channel is a reasonable means of achieving OHC function at any stimulus"

We combined distribution choices with functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the central problem of distributive justice: the trade-off between equity and efficiency. We found that the putamen responds to efficiency, whereas the insula encodes inequity, and the caudate/septal subgenual region encodes a unified measure of efficiency and inequity (utility). Notably, individual differences in inequity aversion correlate with activity in inequity and utility regions. Against utilitarianism, our results support the deontological intuition that a sense of fairness is fundamental to distributive justice but, as suggested by moral sentimentalists, is rooted in emotional processing. More generally, emotional responses related to norm violations may underlie individual differences in equity considerations and adherence to ethical rules."
https://openalex.org/W2042186471,"Fast-spiking cells (FS cells) are a prominent subtype of neocortical GABAergic interneurons with important functional roles. Multiple FS cell properties are coordinated for rapid response. Here, we describe an FS cell feature that serves to gate the powerful inhibition produced by FS cell activity. We show that FS cells in layer 2/3 barrel cortex possess a dampening mechanism mediated by Kv1.1-containing potassium channels localized to the axon initial segment. These channels powerfully regulate action potential threshold and allow FS cells to respond preferentially to large inputs that are fast enough to ""outrun"" Kv1 activation. In addition, Kv1.1 channel blockade converts the delay-type discharge pattern of FS cells to one of continuous fast spiking without influencing the high-frequency firing that defines FS cells. Thus, Kv1 channels provide a key counterbalance to the established rapid-response characteristics of FS cells, regulating excitability through a unique combination of electrophysiological properties and discrete subcellular localization."

https://openalex.org/W2044160856,"Alternative splicing provides a means to increase the complexity of gene function in numerous biological processes, including nervous system wiring. Navigating axons switch responses from attraction to repulsion at intermediate targets, allowing them to grow to each intermediate target and then to move on. The mechanisms underlying this switch remain poorly characterized. We previously showed that the Slit receptor Robo3 is required for spinal commissural axons to enter and cross the midline intermediate target. We report here the existence of two functionally antagonistic isoforms of Robo3 with distinct carboxy termini arising from alternative splicing. Robo3.1 is deployed on the precrossing and crossing portions of commissural axons and allows midline crossing by silencing Slit repulsion. Robo3.2 becomes expressed on the postcrossing portion and blocks midline recrossing, favoring Slit repulsion. The tight spatial regulation of opponent splice variants helps ensure high-fidelity transition of axonal responses from attraction to repulsion at the midline.

The tight spatial regulation of opponent splice variants helps ensure high-fidelity transition of axonal responses from attraction to repulsion at the midline. Developing axons grow over long distances by navigating a series of intermediate targets along their trajectory to their final destination. Axons are attracted to intermediate targets, but upon arriving they must switch their responsiveness to cues at the targets so they are no longer attracted and instead are repelled away; this plasticity of responses allows axons to move on to the next leg of their trajectory (Dickson, 2002Dickson B.J. Molecular mechanisms of axon guidance.Science. 2002; 298: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar, Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996Tessier-Lavigne M. Goodman C.S. The molecular biology of axon guidance.Science. 1996; 274: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (2592) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of this switch for accurate long-range axon guidance, the mechanisms underlying it remain only partially understood. The midline of the central nervous system has provided a well-studied example of an intermediate target at which axons switch their responses. The axons of commissural interneurons grow toward the midline in response to attractants, including netrins and, in vertebrates, Sonic hedgehog (Charron et al., 2003Charron F. Stein E. Jeong J. McMahon A.P. Tessier-Lavigne M.

The molecular biology of axon guidance.Science. 1996; 274: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (2592) Google Scholar). These axons are initially insensitive to repellents also present at the midline, including Slit proteins; upon crossing the midline, a switch occurs such that these axons lose responsiveness to the attractants and instead become repelled by the repellents, so that the axons can leave the midline and then never recross (Kaprielian et al., 2001Kaprielian Z.

The switch from attraction to repulsion requires coordinated control of the expression level as well as the activity of guidance receptors on the axon surface. For example, as axons approach the midline, receptors of the DCC family mediate the attractive action of netrins (Dickson, 2002Dickson B.J. Molecular mechanisms of axon guidance.Science. 2002; 298: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar), while the expression level of Robos, receptors for Slits, is kept low in order to minimize Slit repulsion (Kidd et al., 1998aKidd T.

A variety of mechanisms have been suggested to control the expression and activity of guidance receptors during midline crossing (reviewed in Garbe and Bashaw, 2004Garbe D.S. Bashaw G.J. Axon guidance at the midline: from mutants to mechanisms.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 39: 319-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), including protein trafficking (e.g., in Drosophila, the Commissureless protein prevents Robo from localizing to the axon surface before midline crossing [Keleman et al., 2002Keleman K. Rajagopalan S. Cleppien D. Teis D. Paiha K. Huber L.A. Technau G.M. Dickson B.J.

Lu Q. Flanagan J.G. Axonal protein synthesis provides a mechanism for localized regulation at an intermediate target.Cell. 2002; 110: 223-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar]), and the formation of receptor complexes (e.g., a Robo/DCC interaction in postcrossing axons can inhibit DCC activity [Stein and Tessier-Lavigne, 2001Stein E. Tessier-Lavigne M. Hierarchical organization of guidance receptors: silencing of netrin attraction by slit through a Robo/DCC receptor complex.Science. 2001; 291: 1928-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar]). Alternative pre-mRNA splicing provides an additional means to increase the complexity of gene function by producing protein products with a spectrum of properties from a single coding locus (Black, 2000Black D.L. Protein diversity from alternative splicing: a challenge for bioinformatics and post-genome biology.Cell. 2000; 103: 367-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, Graveley, 2001Graveley B.R. Alternative splicing: increasing diversity in the proteomic world.Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 100-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). This mechanism has been shown to diversify the functions of a number of genes regulating neural function and neural wiring (reviewed in Lipscombe, 2005Lipscombe D. Neuronal proteins custom designed by alternative splicing.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2005; 15: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, Li et al., 2007Li Q. Lee J.A. Black D.L. Neuronal regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). For example, significant alternative splicing has been documented for neurexins and neuroligins, molecules implicated in establishing synaptic specificity (Craig and Kang, 2007Craig A.M. Kang Y. Neurexin-neuroligin signaling in synapse development.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). An extreme example of the molecular diversity generated by alternative splicing is provided by the neural recognition molecule Down's syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM), which, in Drosophila, can exist in tens of thousands of isoforms arising from alternative splicing (Zipursky et al., 2006Zipursky S.L. Wojtowicz W.M. Hattori D. Got diversity? Wiring the fly brain with Dscam.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 581-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The evidence indicates that each isoform binds tightly to itself but not to the other isoforms, a remarkable degree of homophilic recognition that provides the basis for self-repulsion of the processes of individual neural cells (Hattori et al., 2007Hattori D. Demir E. Kim H.W. Viragh E. Zipursky S.L. Dickson B.J. Dscam diversity is essential for neuronal wiring and self-recognition.Nature. 2007; 449: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, Matthews et al., 2007Matthews B.J. Kim M.E. Flanagan J.J.

A vast repertoire of Dscam binding specificities arises from modular interactions of variable Ig domains.Cell. 2007; 130: 1134-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Whether alternative splicing is also used to diversify the function of guidance molecules at intermediate targets has not, however, been described. Here, we report that alternative splicing provides a crucial level of control over the function of a guidance receptor used to navigate the midline intermediate target in the spinal cord. Previously, we described an unexpected role for the third mammalian Robo, Robo3 (also known as Rig1 [Yuan et al., 1999Yuan S.S. Cox L.A. Dasika G.K. Lee E.Y. Cloning and functional studies of a novel gene aberrantly expressed in RB-deficient embryos.Dev. Biol. 1999; 207: 62-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar]), in regulating commissural axon guidance at the spinal cord midline. Contrary to the other two vertebrate Robos, Robo1 and Robo2, whose expression, as described above, is low before crossing and high after crossing (Long et al., 2004Long H. Sabatier C. Ma L. Plump A. Yuan W. Ornitz D.M. Tamada A. Murakami F. Goodman C.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Conserved roles for Slit and Robo proteins in midline commissural axon guidance.Neuron. 2004; 42: 213-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), Robo3 is expressed at high levels before crossing and is gradually downregulated after crossing (Sabatier et al., 2004Sabatier C. Plump A.S. Le M. Brose K. Tamada A. Murakami F. Lee E.Y. Tessier-Lavigne M. The divergent Robo family protein rig-1/Robo3 is a negative regulator of slit responsiveness required for midline crossing by commissural axons.Cell. 2004; 117: 157-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar; see also Figure 1B). Also contrasting with the other two Robos, Robo3 activity keeps commissural axons nonresponsive to midline Slits before crossing, and it does so by silencing Slit repulsion that would otherwise be mediated by Robo1 and Robo2 (Sabatier et al., 2004Sabatier C. Plump A.S. Le M. Brose K. Tamada A. Murakami F. Lee E.Y. Tessier-Lavigne M. The divergent Robo family protein rig-1/Robo3 is a negative regulator of slit responsiveness required for midline crossing by commissural axons.Cell. 2004; 117: 157-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). As a result, in Robo3 knockout mice commissural axons are prematurely responsive to midline Slit repellents before midline crossing and are therefore totally unable to cross the midline (Marillat et al., 2004Marillat V. Sabatier C. Failli V. Matsunaga E. Sotelo C. Tessier-Lavigne M. Chedotal A.

Mutations in human Robo3, discovered in patients with horizontal gaze palsy and progressive scoliosis syndrome (HGPPS), were similarly found to result in significant midline crossing defects (Jen et al., 2004Jen J.C.

D, dorsal; V, ventral.(B–D) The Robo3 isoforms, together with gfp, were introduced into chick commissural axons by in ovo electroporation, and spinal cords were examined in an open-book view. In these and all the following open-book images, spinal cords were oriented with the ventral midline in the center, transfected neuronal cell bodies sitting to the left (not shown), and the rostral end of spinal cords pointing up. Brackets represent the span of the midline. All axons expressing GFP alone (B) appeared normal, entering and crossing the midline, then turning rostrally. When Robo3.1 was overexpressed, all axons entered the midline normally but many then recrossed (green arrows in [C]). Ectopic expression of Robo3.2, however, led to some axons turning away from the midline before entering (red arrows in [D]). Scale bar, 20 μm.(E–I) A modified whole-embryo culture (WEC) method was used to express Robo3 coding sequences. The cultured mouse embryos (bottom panel of [E], [H], and [I]) were comparable to those that developed normally in vivo (top panel of [E]–[G]) in their gross morphology, size, and axonal marker expression after 1 or 2 days in culture (DIC).

(B–D) The Robo3 isoforms, together with gfp, were introduced into chick commissural axons by in ovo electroporation, and spinal cords were examined in an open-book view. In these and all the following open-book images, spinal cords were oriented with the ventral midline in the center, transfected neuronal cell bodies sitting to the left (not shown), and the rostral end of spinal cords pointing up. Brackets represent the span of the midline. All axons expressing GFP alone (B) appeared normal, entering and crossing the midline, then turning rostrally. When Robo3.1 was overexpressed, all axons entered the midline normally but many then recrossed (green arrows in [C]). Ectopic expression of Robo3.2, however, led to some axons turning away from the midline before entering (red arrows in [D]). Scale bar, 20 μm. (E–I) A modified whole-embryo culture (WEC) method was used to express Robo3 coding sequences. The cultured mouse embryos (bottom panel of [E], [H], and [I]) were comparable to those that developed normally in vivo (top panel of [E]–[G]) in their gross morphology, size, and axonal marker expression after 1 or 2 days in culture (DIC).

Here, we report an unexpected complexity and sophistication in the function of Robo3 that arises from alternative splicing of its pre-mRNA. We found that two isoforms of Robo3, Robo3.1 and Robo3.2, are generated by differential intron retention, a less common form of alternative splicing. These isoforms have opposite functions: one favors, whereas the other blocks, midline crossing. In addition, they are tightly spatially regulated, with Robo3.1 expressed on the precrossing segment of commissural axons and Robo3.2 on the postcrossing segment. This abrupt transition helps ensure a high fidelity in the growth cone's switch from attraction to repulsion at the midline. The tight spatial localization of splice isoforms of a guidance receptor documented here thus provides another mechanism for the nervous system to control intricate guidance events, helping explain the accuracy of axon guidance required for proper brain wiring. In the course of sequencing a collection of Robo3 full-length cDNA clones from mouse dorsal spinal cord, we discovered that the 3′ end of the mouse Robo3 mRNA can be alternatively spliced to generate a second isoform that is distinct in its carboxy terminus from the previously published cDNA ([Yuan et al., 1999Yuan S.S. Cox L.A. Dasika G.K. Lee E.Y. Cloning and functional studies of a novel gene aberrantly expressed in RB-deficient embryos.Dev. Biol. 1999; 207: 62-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar]; NCBI accession number AF060570; Figure 1A). We term the new isoform Robo3.1 and the original one Robo3.2 (based on their expression: see below). The novel Robo3.1 transcript arises from splicing of exon 26 to exon 27 and then to exon 28 (an analogous splicing event is seen for the human Robo3 locus [Jen et al., 2004Jen J.C. Chan W.M. Bosley T.M. Wan J. Carr J.R. Rub U. Shattuck D. Salamon G. Kudo L.C. Ou J. et al.Mutations in a human ROBO gene disrupt hindbrain axon pathway crossing and morphogenesis.Science. 2004; 304: 1509-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar]); the resulting 78 amino acid peptide is highly enriched in arginine/serine dipeptide repeats (see Figure S1 available online). The previously described Robo3.2 transcript, in contrast, arises from retention of the intron between exons 26 and 27. The intronic sequence contains a stop codon and encodes a 43 amino acid peptide that is quite distinct from the Robo3.1 carboxy terminus but shows conservation between rodents and humans (Figure 1A and Figure S1). The mRNAs for the two isoforms are both expressed in the spinal cord during the period of commissural axon growth to and across the midline, i.e., from embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) to 12.5 (E12.5) (see below). Immunohistochemistry with isoform-specific antibodies on spinal cord sections revealed strikingly distinct localization patterns (Figures 1B–1G and Figures S1 and S2A–S2F; the signals were specific, because they were absent in the Robo3 mutant, which loses both isoforms [Figures S2G–S2I]). Robo3.1 is highly expressed on commissural axons before and during midline crossing (Figure 1C, Figure S2B, and data not shown). Its expression is rapidly switched off after midline crossing because it was not seen at all in ventral fiber tracts (Figure 1C and Figure S2B). In contrast, Robo3.2 expression was detectable only at a low level at E11.5 and increased in expression at E12.5, and at both ages was seen exclusively on the portion of commissural axons distal to the midline (Figure 1D and Figure S2C and Figure 1G and Figure S2F). The expression patterns of these two isoforms together appear to account to a considerable extent, and perhaps entirely, for the pattern we visualized previously using a pan-Robo3 antibody, which showed high expression before crossing (attributed to Robo3.1) and expression after crossing that was eventually downregulated (attributed to Robo3.2) (Sabatier et al., 2004Sabatier C. Plump A.S. Le M. Brose K. Tamada A. Murakami F. Lee E.Y. Tessier-Lavigne M. The divergent Robo family protein rig-1/Robo3 is a negative regulator of slit responsiveness required for midline crossing by commissural axons.Cell. 2004; 117: 157-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar; Figures 1B and 1E and Figures S2A and S2D). The immunoreactivity in the ventral fiber tracts seen with the pan-Robo3 antibody appeared slightly more extensive than with the Robo3.2 antibody, suggesting either that there is an additional Robo3 isoform expressed after crossing or that the pan-Robo3 antibody is more sensitive. Nonetheless, there is a precise switch in expression on commissural axons from Robo3.1 before and during midline crossing to Robo3.2 after crossing (Figure 1H). To functionally characterize the two isoforms, we ectopically expressed them individually in chick commissural neurons by in ovo electroporation (see Experimental Procedures). Unlike the endogenous Robo3 in mice, Robo3 expressed from the transgene (possessing the β-actin promoter and the β-globin 3′UTR) was expressed throughout the length of chick commissural axons (Figures S3A and S3B). When Robo3.1 is persistently expressed before and after crossing, all GFP-expressing axons entered the midline normally, but many inappropriately recrossed (Figure 2C and Figure S6; 13/13 embryos). This result supports our model (Sabatier et al., 2004Sabatier C. Plump A.S. Le M. Brose K. Tamada A. Murakami F. Lee E.Y. Tessier-Lavigne M. The divergent Robo family protein rig-1/Robo3 is a negative regulator of slit responsiveness required for midline crossing by commissural axons.Cell. 2004; 117: 157-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) that Robo3—more specifically, the Robo3.1 isoform—can repress midline repulsion. Remarkably, overexpression of Robo3.2 had the opposite effect: many axons failed to enter the midline and remained on the ipsilateral side, whereas those that did cross did not recross (Figure 1D and Figure S6; 14/14 embryos; the same phenotype was also observed with a full-length Robo1 cDNA [data not shown]). These axons appear to be misrouted commissural axons rather than ipsilateral projection axons, as the latter assume a longitudinal trajectory at more dorsal positions, far from the midline. To further test the activities of the two Robo3 isoforms, we investigated their abilities to rescue the murine Robo3/Rig1 knockout phenotype by introducing each of them back into the mutant. This was achieved by electroporating Robo3.1 and Robo3.2 constructs into the spinal cord of embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) mouse embryos and culturing the embryos in vitro for 2–3 days, to a developmental stage equivalent to E11.5–E12.5, using a modification of existing whole-embryo culture methods (Figures 2E–2I; for detailed description and protocol, see Experimental Procedures). Plasmids introduced in this way were expressed in commissural neurons on the electroporated side during the period of growth to and across the midline. For example, a gfp plasmid introduced into Robo3 mutant embryos revealed the previously described noncrossing phenotype (Figure 2J). Robo3.1 cDNA could restore midline crossing in the mutant to a large extent (Figure 2K and Table S1). In contrast, no axons were seen at the midline or on the contralateral side when Robo3.2 was introduced back into the mutant (Figure 2L and Table S1), even though the protein, like Robo3.1, was expressed precrossing (Figures S3C and S3D). These data together support the idea that Robo3.1 (but not Robo3.2) can repress premature repulsion during commissural axon midline crossing. Further support was obtained by repeating in wild-type mouse embryos the forced expression experiment that we had performed in chicks, using the mouse whole-embryo culture technique, with similar results (Figures S4 and S6). We also found that a chimeric protein comprising the cytoplasmic domain of Robo3.1 fused to the extracellular and transmembrane regions of Robo1 (Robo1out-Robo3.1in) was able to rescue midline crossing when introduced into Robo3 mutants (Figure 2M and Table S1), thus focusing attention on the cytoplasmic domain of Robo3.1 in mediating its function. The expression patterns of Robo3.1 and Robo3.2 and their activities in forced expression and rescue experiments suggest a model in which Robo3.1 expressed on commissural axons before and during midline crossing serves to suppress Slit repulsion, allowing them to enter the midline (Figure 5A), whereas Robo3.2 expressed on the axons after crossing may contribute to preventing midline crossing, either by directly mediating Slit repulsion, by interfering with residual Robo3.1 on the axons, or by some other means (Figure 5B). To test this model further, we performed isoform-specific knockdown in vivo using small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides in the whole-embryo culture system. For Robo3.2, we used an siRNA targeting a sequence in intron 26, which is not found in Robo3.1 (Figure 3A). We had less flexibility for Robo3.1 because all sequences in Robo3.1 are also found in Robo3.2. We reasoned, however, that an siRNA specifically targeting the junction between exons 26 and 27 might inhibit Robo3.1 expression without affecting Robo3.2 mRNA (Figure 3A). A positive control was provided by a pan-Robo3 siRNA targeting a sequence in the common exon 9, and a negative control by introducing five mismatch mutations into this pan-Robo3 siRNA (Robo3mismatch). In control experiments using transfected COS cells, pan-Robo3 siRNA caused a complete absence of both isoforms (but did not affect Robo1, DCC [the netrin receptor], or the surface proteins TAG-1 and L1 [Figure 3B and data not shown]), whereas Robo3mismatch had no effect on any of these proteins (Figure 3B and data not shown). Robo3.1 and Robo3.2 siRNAs were able to selectively reduce the levels of their respective targets with no detectable reduction of the other, although the Robo3.1 siRNA was only partially effective (Figure 3B). We tested these siRNAs in vivo by electroporating into E9.5 embryos followed by whole-embryo culture. The pan-Robo3 siRNA caused commissural axons to steer away from the midline before entering and to navigate on the ipsilateral side (Figures 3C and 3G), phenocopying the effect of genetic removal of Robo3 (Sabatier et al., 2004Sabatier C.

We show that the human cytomegalovirus UL97 protein has activities similar to cellular cyclin–cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes. UL97 phosphorylated and inactivated the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor, stimulated cell cycle progression in mammalian cells, and rescued proliferation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking CDK activity. UL97 is not inhibited by the CDK inhibitor p21 and lacks amino acid residues conserved in the CDKs that permit the attenuation of kinase activity. Thus, UL97 represents a functional ortholog of cellular CDKs that is immune from normal CDK control mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2005740454,"The microtubule-associated protein tau can associate with various other proteins in addition to tubulin, including the SH3 domains of Src family tyrosine kinases. Tau is well known to aggregate to form hyperphosphorylated filamentous deposits in several neurodegenerative diseases (tauopathies) including Alzheimer disease. We now report that tau can bind to SH3 domains derived from the p85alpha subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase Cgamma1, and the N-terminal (but not the C-terminal) SH3 of Grb2 as well as to the kinases Fyn, cSrc, and Fgr. However, the short inserts found in neuron-specific isoforms of Src prevented the binding of tau. The experimentally determined binding of tau peptides is well accounted for when modeled into the peptide binding cleft in the SH3 domain of Fyn. After phosphorylation in vitro or in transfected cells, tau showed reduced binding to SH3 domains; no binding was detected with hyperphosphorylated tau isolated from Alzheimer brain, but SH3 binding was restored by phosphatase treatment. Tau mutants with serines and threonines replaced by glutamate, to mimic phosphorylation, showed reduced SH3 binding. These results strongly suggest that tau has a potential role in cell signaling in addition to its accepted role in cytoskeletal assembly, with regulation by phosphorylation that may be disrupted in the tauopathies including Alzheimer disease."
https://openalex.org/W2014213378,"Here we describe the properties of a synapse in the Drosophila antennal lobe and show how they can explain certain sensory computations in this brain region. The synapse between olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and projection neurons (PNs) is very strong, reflecting a large number of release sites and high release probability. This is likely one reason why weak ORN odor responses are amplified in PNs. Furthermore, the amplitude of unitary synaptic currents in a PN is matched to the size of its dendritic arbor. This matching may compensate for a lower input resistance of larger dendrites to produce uniform depolarization across PN types. Consistent with this idea, a genetic manipulation that lowers input resistance increases unitary synaptic currents. Finally, strong stimuli produce short-term depression at this synapse. This helps explain why PN odor responses are transient, and why strong ORN odor responses are not amplified as powerfully as weak responses."

https://openalex.org/W2019294804,"GABA synapses play a critical role in many aspects of circuit development and function. For example, conditions that perturb GABA transmission have been implicated in epilepsy. To identify genes that regulate GABA transmission, we performed an RNAi screen for genes whose inactivation increases the activity of C. elegans body muscles, which receive direct input from GABAergic motor neurons. We identified 90 genes, 21 of which were previously implicated in seizure syndromes, suggesting that this screen has effectively identified candidate genes for epilepsy. Electrophysiological recordings and imaging of excitatory and inhibitory synapses indicate that several genes alter muscle activity by selectively regulating GABA transmission. In particular, we identify two humoral pathways and several protein kinases that modulate GABA transmission but have little effect on excitatory transmission at cholinergic neuromuscular junctions. Our data suggest these conserved genes are components of signaling pathways that regulate GABA transmission and consequently may play a role in epilepsy and other cognitive or psychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2072498692,"The IkappaB kinase (IKK)-related kinases, IKKepsilon and TBK1, participate in the induction of type I interferons (IFNs) during viral infections. Deregulated activation of IKKepsilon and TBK1 also contributes to the abnormal cell survival and transformation. However, how these kinases are negatively regulated remains unclear. We show here that the tumor suppressor CYLD has an essential role in preventing aberrant activation of IKKepsilon/TBK1. CYLD deficiency causes constitutive activation of IKKepsilon/TBK1, which is associated with hyper-induction of IFNs in virus-infected cells. We further show that CYLD targets a cytoplasmic RNA sensor, RIG-I, and inhibits the ubiquitination of this IKKepsilon/TBK1 stimulator. Consistent with the requirement of ubiquitination in RIG-I function, CYLD potently inhibits RIG-I-mediated activation of the IFN-beta promoter. These findings establish CYLD as a key negative regulator of IKKepsilon/TBK1 and suggest a role for CYLD in the control of RIG-I ubiquitination."

We show that mutations within the pore helix domain dramatically increase basal channel activity and responsiveness to chemical and thermal stimuli. Mutation of corresponding residues within two related TRPV channels leads to comparable effects on their activation properties. Our data suggest that conformational changes in the outer pore region are critical for determining the balance between open and closed states, providing evidence for a general role for this domain in TRP channel activation."

To establish an experimental model of heme acquisition by this system, we have investigated hemin transfer between the various couples of human methemoglobin (metHb), IsdA, IsdB, IsdC, and IsdE by spectroscopic and kinetic analyses. The efficiencies of hemin transfer from hemin-containing donors (holo-protein) to different hemin-free acceptors (apo-protein) were examined, and the rates of the transfer reactions were compared with that of indirect loss of hemin from the relevant donor to H64Y/V68F apomyoglobin. The efficiencies, spectral changes, and kinetics of the transfer reactions demonstrate that: 1) metHb directly transfers hemin to apo-IsdB, but not to apo-IsdA, apo-IsdC, and apo-IsdE; 2) holo-IsdB directly transfers hemin to apo-IsdA and apo-IsdC, but not to apo-IsdE; 3) apo-IsdE directly acquires hemin from holo-IsdC, but not from holo-IsdB and holo-IsdA; and 4) IsdB and IsdC enhance hemin transfer from metHb to apo-IsdC and from holo-IsdB to apo-IsdE, respectively. Taken together with our recent finding that holo-IsdA directly transfers its hemin to apo-IsdC, these results provide direct experimental evidence for a model in which IsdB acquires hemin from metHb and transfers it directly or through IsdA to IsdC. Hemin is then relayed to IsdE, the lipoprotein component of the IsdDEF transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1964258072,"Synaptic connections of neurons in the Drosophila lamina, the most peripheral synaptic region of the visual system, have been comprehensively described. Although the lamina has been used extensively as a model for the development and plasticity of synaptic connections, the neurotransmitters in these circuits are still poorly known. Thus, to unravel possible neurotransmitter circuits in the lamina of Drosophila we combined Gal4 driven green fluorescent protein in specific lamina neurons with antisera to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamic acid decarboxylase, a GABAB type of receptor, L-glutamate, a vesicular glutamate transporter (vGluT), ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, choline acetyltransferase and a vesicular acetylcholine transporter. We suggest that acetylcholine may be used as a neurotransmitter in both L4 monopolar neurons and a previously unreported type of wide-field tangential neuron (Cha-Tan). GABA is the likely transmitter of centrifugal neurons C2 and C3 and GABAB receptor immunoreactivity is seen on these neurons as well as the Cha-Tan neurons. Based on an rdl-Gal4 line, the ionotropic GABAA receptor subunit RDL may be expressed by L4 neurons and a type of tangential neuron (rdl-Tan). Strong vGluT immunoreactivity was detected in α-processes of amacrine neurons and possibly in the large monopolar neurons L1 and L2. These neurons also express glutamate-like immunoreactivity. However, antisera to ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors did not produce distinct immunosignals in the lamina. In summary, this paper describes novel features of two distinct types of tangential neurons in the Drosophila lamina and assigns putative neurotransmitters and some receptors to a few identified neuron types."
https://openalex.org/W1974110659,"The ocular dominance (OD) shift that occurs in visual cortex after brief monocular deprivation (MD) is a classic model of experience-dependent cortical plasticity. It has been suggested that OD plasticity in layer 2/3 of visual cortex precedes and is necessary for plasticity in the thalamocortical input layer 4. Here, we show in mouse visual cortex that rapid OD plasticity occurs simultaneously in layers 2/3 and 4. Remarkably, pharmacological blockade of cannabinoid receptors completely prevents the OD shift in layer 2/3, leaving plasticity intact in layer 4. Thus, experience-dependent cortical modifications in layers 2/3 and 4 can occur in parallel, via distinct mechanisms. These findings simplify the mechanistic description of plasticity in layer 4, force a revision in the interpretation of previous studies in which laminar differences in OD plasticity mechanisms were unrecognized, and have important implications for the therapeutic use of cannabinoid receptor antagonists in humans."

https://openalex.org/W2043249054,"The middle atmospheres of planets are driven by a combination of radiative heating and cooling, mean meridional motions, and vertically propagating waves (which originate in the deep troposphere).

On Venus and Titan, waves originating from surface-atmosphere interaction and inertial instability are thought to drive the atmosphere to rotate more rapidly than the surface (superrotation). However, the relevant wave modes have not yet been precisely identified. Here we report infrared observations showing that Saturn has an equatorial oscillation like those found on Earth and Jupiter, as well as a mid-latitude subsidence that may be associated with the equatorial motion. The latitudinal extent of Saturn's oscillation shows that it obeys the same basic physics as do those on Earth and Jupiter. Future highly resolved observations of the temperature profile together with modelling of these three different atmospheres will allow us determine the wave mode, the wavelength and the wave amplitude that lead to middle atmosphere oscillation."

In olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), such regulation on the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel is considered a major mechanism of OSN adaptation. To determine the role of Ca2+/calmodulin desensitization of the olfactory CNG channel, we introduced a mutation in the channel subunit CNGB1b in mice that rendered the channel resistant to fast desensitization by Ca2+/calmodulin. Contrary to expectations, mutant OSNs showed normal receptor current adaptation to repeated stimulation. Rather, they displayed slower response termination and, consequently, reduced ability to transmit olfactory information to the olfactory bulb. They also displayed reduced response decline during sustained odorant exposure. These results suggest that Ca2+/calmodulin-mediated CNG channel fast desensitization is less important in regulating the sensitivity to recurring stimulation than previously thought and instead functions primarily to terminate OSN responses."

Additionally, the Pim kinases phosphorylate Mdm2 in vitro and in cultured cells at Ser166 and Ser186, two previously identified targets of other signaling pathways, including Akt. Surprisingly, at high levels of Pim expression, as would occur in tumors, active, but not inactive, Pim-1 or Pim-2 blocks the degradation of both p53 and Mdm2 in a manner that is independent of Mdm2 phosphorylation, leading to increased p53 levels and, proportionately, p53-dependent transactivation.

Oren M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Mdm2 plays a pivotal role in integrating signals coming into the p53 pathway. For example, the Mdm2 inhibitor, ARF, is induced by hyperproliferative signals, leading to inhibition of p53 and Mdm2 degradation (5de Stanchina E. McCurrach M.E. Zindy F. Shieh S.-Y. Ferbeyre G.

Swigart L.B. Evan G.I. Nature. 2006; 443: 214-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Mdm2 is also regulated by a series of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events, mainly, but not exclusively, in response to DNA damage (reviewed in Ref. 11Meek D.W. Knippschild U. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 1017-1026PubMed Google Scholar). Among these, serine residues 166 and 186 were identified as targets of the Akt protein kinase and shown to be modified in established cell lines in response to serum and to individual survival factors (12Milne D.

Interaction with and phosphorylation by Akt was variously reported to lead to nuclear localization of Mdm2, increased ubiquitylation of p53, increased degradation of p53, decreased association with ARF, and increased interaction with p300 (12Milne D. Kampanis P. Nicol S. Dias S. Campbell D.G. Fuller-Pace F. Meek D. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13Zhou B.P. Liao Y. Xia W. Zou Y. Spohn B. Hung M.C. Nat.

Recently, however, this paradigm has been challenged in a mouse model for prostate cancer, where loss of PTEN, which promotes constitutive activation of Akt, leads to induction of the p53 pathway and, consequently, cellular senescence (19Chen Z. Trotman L.C. Shaffer D. Lin H.K. Dotan Z.A. Niki M. Koutcher J.A. Scher H.I. Ludwig T. Gerald W. Cordon-Cardo C. Pandolfi P.P. Nature. 2005; 436: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). The Pim proteins (Pim-1, Pim-2, and Pim-3 (also known as KID-1)) are a family of short lived protein serine/threonine kinases that are expressed at low levels physiologically, mainly in hematopoietic cells, and are transiently induced in response to a host of cytokines (reviewed in Refs. 20Wang Z. Bhattacharya N. Weaver M. Petersen K. Meyer M. Gapter L. Magnuson N.S. J. Vet. Sci. 2001; 2: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar and 21White E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1813-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mice lacking expression of all three Pim kinases develop normally but are smaller than their wild type counterparts and have impaired responses to certain hematopoietic growth factors (22Mikkers H. Nawijn M. Allen J. Brouwers C. Verhoeven E. Jonkers J. Berns A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 6104-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Pim and Akt kinases have overlapping but independent regulatory roles in hematopoietic cells (23Hammerman P.S. Fox C.J. Birnbaum M.J. Thompson C.B. Blood. 2005; 105: 4477-4483Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and share a growing number of common substrates. Among these, Mdm2 was shown to be phosphorylated by Pim-1 in vitro (24Ionov Y. Le X. Tunquist B.J. Sweetenham J. Sachs T. Ryder J. Johnson T. Lilly M.B. Kraft A.S. Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 167-178PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither the site(s) of phosphorylation nor the effects of Pim-1 on Mdm2 function were established. From a pathological perspective, elevated expression of Pim kinases has been implicated in tumor development and particularly in lymphomagenesis (assessed in Refs. 21White E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1813-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 25Allen J.D. Berns A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1996; 7: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, and 26Fox C.J. Hammerman P.S. Cinalli R.M. Master S.R. Chodosh L.A. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1841-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). For example, the Pim-1 and Pim-2 genes were originally identified as common proviral integration sites in Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced lymphomas (25Allen J.D. Berns A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1996; 7: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Expression of Pim-1 or Pim-2, driven by the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer, predisposes transgenic mice to T cell lymphomas and cooperates potently with Myc in the development of B cell leukemias in utero in transgenic mice (27Allen J.D. Verhoeven E. Domen M. van der Valk M. Berns A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 28Verbeek S. van Lohuizen M. van der Valk M. Domen J. Kraal G. Berns A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Pim kinases are significantly overexpressed in various human cancers, including prostate cancer (29Dhanasekaran S.M. Barrette T.R. Ghosh D. Shah R. Varambally S. Kurachi K. Pienta K.J. Rubin M.A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Nature. 2001; 412: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar), lymphoma (30Yoshida S.

Ishikura H. Fujii C. Mukaida N. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6741-6747Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and colon cancer (34Popivanova B.K. Li Y.Y. Zheng H. Omura K. Fujii C. Tsuneyama K. Mukaida N. Cancer Sci. 2007; 98: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), suggesting a contributory role in human pathogenesis. The percentage of human hematological malignancies showing p53 mutation is low (15% as compared with 50% in tumors of the esophagus, ovary, and colorectum (International Agency for Research on Cancer data base)), suggesting that mechanisms other than p53 mutation (such as ARF loss or mdm2 amplification) are likely to be significant in promoting dysfunction of the p53 pathway in these tumors. Pim-1 can associate with Mdm2 (24Ionov Y. Le X. Tunquist B.J. Sweetenham J. Sachs T. Ryder J. Johnson T. Lilly M.B. Kraft A.S. Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 167-178PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that elevated expression of oncogenes such as pim might contribute to suppressing the p53 response by regulating Mdm2 function. In order to explore this hypothesis, we investigated the ability of the Pim kinases to interact with Mdm2 in vitro and in cultured cells. Surprisingly, we find that rather than suppressing the p53 response, Pim behaves as a classic dominant oncogene that leads to the induction of ARF, p53, p21, and senescence-associated (SA)-β-galactosidase, markers consistent with the onset of cellular senescence. Additionally, we find a striking correlation between elevated levels of Pim-1 and Mdm2 in human mantle cell lymphoma and, consistent with this observation, find that Pim-1 and Mdm2 can stabilize each other in cultured cells. These data raise the possibility that deregulated expression of Pim may prompt a protective p53 response but may also contribute to deregulated Mdm2 expression. Plasmids—Plasmids expressing GST-Mdm2 fusion proteins have been described elsewhere (35Burch L. Scott M. Pohler E. Meek D. Hupp T. J. Mol.

A pcDNA3 derivative expressing CD20 was obtained from Dr. Mark Saville (University of Dundee). A pcDNA3 derivative expressing p14ARF was provided by Dr. Sonia Lain (University of Dundee). Construction of Expression Plasmids for the Pim Kinases—Plasmids encoding full-length human Pim-1, Pim-2, and Pim-3 (Mammalian Gene Collection clones) were obtained from Geneservice Ltd. UK and were amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEX-4T-1 to allow high level expression of GST-tagged Pim-1, Pim-2, and Pim-3 kinases in Escherichia coli and subsequent rapid purification of glutathione-Sepharose beads. For mammalian cell expression, Pim-1 and Pim-2 cDNAs were cloned into pSG9M, a derivative of the pSG5 vector (Stratagene) containing a 5′ Myc 9E10 epitope tag. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. The mutant plasmids were sequenced to verify the presence of the appropriate mutation(s) and to ensure the absence of any fortuitous undesired mutations. Cell Culture—H1299 (p53-null lung carcinoma-derived), U2OS (wild type p53-positive osteocarcinoma-derived), and p53-null/Mdm2-null murine embryo fibroblasts (DKO-MEFs) were cultured in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Nalm-6 cells (wild type p53-positive human pre-B cell line) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen). The Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and RPMI 1640 medium were supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Biosera), 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). Early passage MEFs from Pim-1,-2,-3 triple knockout mice (22Mikkers H. Nawijn M. Allen J. Brouwers C. Verhoeven E. Jonkers J. Berns A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 6104-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and MEFs from wild type littermates were kindly provided by Dr. A. Berns (Netherlands Cancer Institute) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Biosera) and 2 mm l-glutamine. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), prepared from C57BL/6 mice by Dr. Larry Higgins (University of Dundee) were maintained in gelatin-coated flasks and cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 10 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor, and 1% insulin/transferrin/selenium (all from Invitrogen). Transfection of Established Cell Lines—H1299 cells were transfected with plasmids using the calcium phosphate method (37Webster G.A. Perkins N.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 3485-3495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DKO-MEFs were transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection of Primary MEFs and CD20 Enrichment—Primary MEFs were seeded at 8.5 × 105 cells/6-cm plate and transfected 24 h later using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of plasmid expressing CD20 together with 5.5 μg of plasmid expressing Pim-1 kinase or the empty expression vector (pSG9M). Transfected cells were enriched for CD20 expression 48 h post-transfection using Magnetic Dynabeads panmouse IgG as instructed by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Selected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline before lysis for Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed at 4 °C in Igepal lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Igepal) 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm benzamidine, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem)) and incubated for 30 min on ice. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. Equal amounts of protein were added to 40 μl of Protein G-Sepharose beads (prepared as a 50% suspension in lysis buffer) and 1 μg of antibody and rocked at 4 °C for 4 h. The beads were then washed three times in lysis buffer and denatured in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Antibodies and Western Blot Analysis—SDS-PAGE and Western blotting was carried out using standard conditions. Nitrocellulose membranes were probed for the presence of p53 (antibody DO1 (Moravian Biotechnology) or CM-5 (38Midgley C.A. Owens B. Briscoe C.V. Thomas D.B. Lane D.P. Hall P.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1843-1848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), Mdm2 (SMP14 or D12 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA)) or 4B2 (Moravian Biotechnology)), the Myc 9E10 epitope (9E10; Cancer Research UK), p21 (sc-397; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Pim-1 (12H8; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Pim-2 (1D12; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ARF (polyclonal antibody from Dr S. Lain (University of Dundee)), or actin (20-33; Sigma). Western analysis using phosphospecific antibodies was carried out as described elsewhere (12Milne D. Kampanis P. Nicol S. Dias S. Campbell D.G. Fuller-Pace F. Meek D. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Two phosphospecific antibodies, previously described (12Milne D. Kampanis P. Nicol S. Dias S. Campbell D.G. Fuller-Pace F. Meek D. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), were used to detect Mdm2 phosphorylated at serine 166 and 186, respectively. Secondary antibodies used were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse (DakoCytomation), goat anti-rabbit (DakoCytomation), or donkey anti-goat (sc-2020; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). GST Pull-down Experiments—GST-Mdm2 fusion proteins (35Burch L. Scott M. Pohler E. Meek D. Hupp T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 36Kurki S. Peltonen K. Kiviharju T. Latonen L. Ojala P. Meek D. Laiho M. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) (or GST alone as control) were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and subsequently incubated with extracts of H1299 cells that had been transfected with 10 μg of Pim-1 expression vector. After extensively washing the beads, immobilized proteins were eluted in 2× SDS sample buffer and detected by Western blotting. In Vivo Ubiquitylation Assay—The ubiquitylation assay relies on the tranfection of cells with a plasmid encoding His-tagged ubiquitin followed by the capture and purification of ubiquitylated proteins from cell extracts using nickel-agarose beads. This assay has been described in significant detail elsewhere (39Xirodimas D. Saville M.K. Edling C. Lane D.P. Lain S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4972-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The purified ubiquitylated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. Luciferase Reporter Assays—H1299 and p53/Mdm2-double knock-out (DKO) MEF cells (3 × 104/well) were seeded onto a 24-well plate and transfected in triplicate using Fugene. Luciferase reporter plasmids PG13-luc (50 ng (40Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar)) and SV-Renilla luciferase (0.5 ng) were transfected along with plasmids expressing p53 (1 ng (41Dumaz N. Meek D.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7002-7010Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar)), Mdm2 (20 ng (42Allende-Vega N. Saville M.K. Meek D.W. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4234-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)), Pim-1 kinase (50–200 ng), and empty expression vector (pSG9M or pcDNA3), as appropriate. Transfected cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection by adding 100 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega) per well. 20 μl of protein extract was analyzed in a luminometer using the Dual Luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). Variations in transfection efficiencies were corrected by determining the Renilla luciferase activity of the sample. In Vitro Protein Kinase Assays—Mdm2 kinase assays were carried out using GST-Mdm2 fusion proteins (35Burch L. Scott M. Pohler E. Meek D. Hupp T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 36Kurki S. Peltonen K. Kiviharju T. Latonen L. Ojala P. Meek D. Laiho M. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads or purified recombinant Mdm2 as substrate. Kinase assays were carried out in 20 μl of kinase buffer (10 mm MgCl2 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5) containing 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 12 Ci/mmol), and either recombinant Pim-1 (30 ng), Pim-2 (30 ng), or Pim-3 (30 ng). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min (2 h for kinase reactions for in vitro ubiquitination assays) and then terminated in 2× SDS sample buffer. Phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. Immunohistochemistry—Standard immunohistochemistry was carried out using the ChemMate system (DakoCytomation) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After blocking, tissue sections were exposed to the primary antibody (Pim-1, goat polyclonal C-20; Pim-2, mouse monoclonal 1D12; Mdm2, mouse monoclonal antibody 2A9) for either 1 h or overnight in a humidified chamber at 4 °C. Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted using a biotin-streptavidin immunoperoxidase method (ABC Elite; Vector Laboratories) and diaminobenzidine in 0.03% hydrogen peroxide as a chromogen agent (Dako) with the Autostainer and the peroxidase/diaminobenzidine ChemMate detection kit with the TechMate system. Copper sulfate was applied to intensify the signal. Following staining, the slides were dehydrated through ascending grades of alcohol before being cleared in Histoclear and finally mounted, using an automated mounter (Leica CV 5000) with DPX mountant. Negative controls were prepared by replacing the primary antibody with antibody diluent alone (biotin) and buffer for Autostainer (antibody diluent for TechMate). Cell blocks containing H1299 cells transfected with plasmids encoding either Pim-1 or Pim-2 were used as positive controls for staining, and a mock-transfected pellet acted as a further negative control (see below). To ensure that the specificity of antibodies against Pim-1 and Pim-2 was retained for immunohistochemical staining of sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archival clinical material, H1299 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing either human Pim-1 or Pim-2 (as a Myc (9E10) fusion protein) or empty vector. The cells were then harvested, and, following a brief wash in phosphate-buffered saline, they were resuspended in human plasma before the addition of bovine thrombin to form a fibrin clot. The clot was then fixed in neutral buffered formalin for 24–48 h and then processed to form a paraffin wax block in the same way as diagnostic tissue samples. Sections from these cell pellets were then stained to detect Pim-1, Pim-2, and Myc with a standard immunohistochemical technique following microwave antigen retrieval in citric acid buffer, pH 6.0. Pim Kinases Phosphorylate Mdm2 at Serine Residues 166 and 186—To determine whether Mdm2 is a substrate for members of the Pim kinase family, purified recombinant Mdm2 or a series of glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins comprising overlapping regions of Mdm2 were incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP together with recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3. The GST-Mdm2 fusion proteins (see schematic in Fig. 3) are designated as follows with Mdm2 amino acid numbers given in parentheses: MP1-(1–110), MP2-(108–207), MP3-(203–282), and MP4-(279–491) (35Burch L.

Pim-1 phosphorylated full-length Mdm2 and the MP2 miniprotein but did not phosphorylate GST alone or any of the other GST-Mdm2 fusion proteins (Fig. 1A). These data indicate that the phosphorylation site(s) is located within amino acids 110–207 of Mdm2.FIGURE 1Pim-1 phosphorylates Ser166 and Ser186 in Mdm2 in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W2019726119,"sigma-1 receptors represent unique binding sites that are capable of interacting with a wide range of compounds to mediate different cellular events. The composition of the ligand binding site of this receptor is unclear, since no NMR or crystal structures are available. Recent studies in our laboratory using radiolabeled photoreactive ligands suggested that the steroid binding domain-like I (SBDLI) (amino acids 91-109) and the steroid binding domain-like II (SBDLII) (amino acids 176-194) regions are involved in forming the ligand binding site(s) ( Chen, Y., Hajipour, A. R., Sievert, M. K., Arbabian, M., and Ruoho, A. E. (2007) Biochemistry 46, 3532-3542 ; Pal, A., Hajipour, A. R., Fontanilla, D., Ramachandran, S., Chu, U. B., Mavlyutov, T., and Ruoho, A. E. (2007) Mol. Pharmacol. 72, 921-933 ). In this report, we have further addressed this issue by utilizing our previously developed sulfhydryl-reactive, cleavable, radioiodinated photocross-linking reagent: methanesulfonothioic acid, S-((4-(4-amino-3-[125I]iodobenzoyl) phenyl)methyl) ester (Guo, L. W., Hajipour, A. R., Gavala, M. L., Arbabian, M., Martemyanov, K. A., Arshavsky, V. Y., and Ruoho, A. E. (2005) Bioconjugate Chem. 16, 685-693). This photoprobe was shown to derivatize the single cysteine residues as mixed disulfides at position 94 in the SBDLI region of the wild type guinea pig sigma-1 receptor (Cys94) and at position 190 in the SBDLII region of a mutant guinea pig sigma-1 receptor (C94A,V190C), both in a sigma-ligand (haloperidol or (+)-pentazocine)-sensitive manner. Significantly, photocross-linking followed by Endo Lys-C cleavage under reducing conditions and intramolecular radiolabel transfer from the SBDLI to the SBDLII region in the wild type receptor and, conversely, from the SBDLII to the SBDLI region in the mutant receptor were observed. These data support a model in which the SBDLI and SBDLII regions are juxtaposed to form, at least in part, a ligand binding site of the sigma-1 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2111305238,"Previous studies from our laboratory had indicated that cytochrome c-independent processing and activation of caspase-9 by caspase-8 contributed to early amplification of the caspase cascade in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-treated murine cells. Here we show that murine caspase-9 is phosphorylated by casein kinase 2 (CK2) on a serine near the site of caspase-8 cleavage. CK2 has been shown to regulate cleavage of the pro-apoptotic Bid protein by phosphorylating serine residues near its caspase-8 cleavage site. Similarly, CK2 modification of Ser348 on caspase-9 appears to render the protease refractory to cleavage by active caspase-8. This phosphorylation did not affect the ability of caspase-9 to autoprocess. Substitution of Ser348 abolished phosphorylation but not cleavage, and a phospho-site mutant promoted apoptosis in TNF-α-treated caspase-9 knock-out mouse embryo fibroblasts. Furthermore, inhibition of CK2 activity and RNA interference-mediated knockdown of the kinase accelerated caspase-9 activation, whereas phosphatase inhibition delayed both caspase-9 activation and death in response to TNF receptor occupation. Taken together, these studies show that TNF receptor cross-linking promotes dephosphorylation of caspase-9, rendering it susceptible to processing by activated caspase-8 protein. Thus, our data suggest that modification of procaspase-9 to protect it from inappropriate cleavage and activation is yet another mechanism by which the oncogenic kinase CK2 promotes survival.

However, cyt c-independent mechanisms of activation of this caspase have also been demonstrated. Caspase-12 was able to process and activate caspase-9 in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, whereas Sendai virus infection triggered a novel pathway of caspase-9 cleavage (3Bitzer M.

Furthermore, early amplification of the caspase cascade in response to TNF receptor cross-linking on Bcl-xL-expressing murine pro B lymphoma cells, in which the mitochondrial amplification loop is essentially unavailable, occurred via cyt c-independent activation of caspase-9 (6McDonnell M.A. Wang D. Khan S.M. Vander Heiden M.G. Kelekar A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This study did not rule out dimerizaton of caspase-9 in this pathway but implicated active caspase-8 in its processing and activation. The involvement of caspase-8 in apoptosome-independent activation of caspase-9 in murine cells has recently been demonstrated in another study (7Gyrd-Hansen M. Farkas T. Fehrenbacher N. Bastholm L. Hoyer-Hansen M. Elling F. Wallach D. Flavell R. Kroemer G. Nylandsted J. Jaattela M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 7880-7891Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The observation that caspase-8 could directly activate an initiator caspase of the intrinsic pathway without the involvement of mitochondria in death receptor-induced apoptosis suggested that some murine cells harbor both Type I and II characteristics (8Scaffidi C.

Both human and murine caspase-9 harbor a number of serines, threonines, and tyrosines, and a variety of kinases including ERK2, protein kinase A, protein kinase Cζ, and c-Abl tyrosine kinase have been implicated in regulating the activation of this protease (9Allan L.A.

Phosphorylation of Ser196 on human caspase-9 by the oncogenic kinase Akt is believed to regulate its apoptotic activity, although the murine form lacks this serine (13Cardone M.H. Roy N.

Kikkawa U. Momoi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Protein kinase CK2 (formerly casein kinase II), is a serine/threonine kinase that affects several signaling pathways (15Ahmed K. Gerber D.A. Cochet C. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 226-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 16Seldin D.C. Landesman-Bollag E. Farago M. Currier N. Lou D. Dominguez I. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2005; 274: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Unlike the majority of protein kinases, CK2 is constitutively active and independent of second messengers or phosphorylation events. It phosphorylates a variety of substrates involved in cell cycle control, differentiation and proliferation (17Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar, 18Canton D.A. Litchfield D.W. Cell Signal. 2006; 18: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It is a highly conserved, ubiquitous, and pleiotropic protein kinase comprising two catalytic subunits, α and/or α′, and two regulatory (β) subunits that form a heterotetrameric holoenzyme (19Litchfield D.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). The high constitutive activity of CK2 in cancer cells is believed to underlie its oncogenic potential (15Ahmed K. Gerber D.A.

CK2 recognizes phospho-acceptor sites that are specified by clusters of acidic residues, with the one at position n+3 relative to the target amino acid playing a particularly crucial role (21Pinna L.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3873-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The frequency of aspartyl and glutamyl residues in its phosphoacceptor sites suggested that phosphorylation by CK2 could regulate caspase cleavage, which is known to occur at the carboxyl terminus of the acidic consensus E/DXD (17Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). In the present study we show that CK2 modifies a serine in the vicinity of the primary processing site of murine caspase-9 in proliferating cells, protecting the protease from cleavage and activation by other caspases. Cell Lines, Antibodies, and Plasmid Constructs—FL5.12 murine pro B lymphoma cells were cultured as described earlier (22Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2928) Google Scholar). The generation of FL5.12-Neo and FL5.12-Bcl-xL cells has also been described previously (23Kelekar A. Chang B.S. Harlan J.E. Fesik S.W. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7040-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Electroporation of FL5.12 Bcl-xL cells with pGIPZ shRNAmir vectors was carried out under similar conditions, and transfectants were selected in the presence of 2 μg/ml puromycin. Caspase-9-/- MEFs (a gift from Richard Flavell, Yale University) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 10 mm β–mercaptoethanol. Caspase-9 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Stressgen Biotechnologies and NeoMarkers, Inc., anti-FLAG M2 antibody from Sigma, anti-actin monoclonal from EMD Biosciences, anti-CK2 from Upstate/Millipore, and anti-vinculin from Abcam, Inc. The caspase-8 antibody was a gift from Idun Pharmaceuticals, and polyclonal phosphoserine-specific antibodies were from Qiagen. Active recombinant caspase-3 and caspase-8 were purchased from Pharmingen. The pGIPZ shR-NAmir CK2 vectors and nonsilencing control were purchased from Open Biosystems (CK2-α clone identification code V2LMM_188343 and CK2-β clone identification code V2LMM_66668). Construction of full-length murine caspase-9 (mC-9) cDNA and the Myc-tagged version, mC-9myc has been previously described (6McDonnell M.A. Wang D. Khan S.M. Vander Heiden M.G. Kelekar A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Point mutants of mC-9, substituting Ser348 with alanine, glycine, or valine or Ser350 with alanine, were generated by a two-step PCR method. Inserts were ligated to BamHI and XhoI sites of the pcmyc vector (6McDonnell M.A. Wang D. Khan S.M. Vander Heiden M.G. Kelekar A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The FLAG-tagged murine caspase-9 construct was generated by inserting a HindIII/XhoI fragment containing full-length murine caspase-9 into HindIII/SalI sites of the pFLAG-CTC vector (Sigma). In Vitro Caspase Cleavage Assay—Radiolabeled mC-9 and mutant proteins were synthesized in vitro using the TnT T7 transcription/translation system (Promega Biotech) and 15 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) per reaction. Translated proteins were cleaved at 37 °C for 60 min using 5 μl of in vitro translation mix as substrate in the presence of active human recombinant caspase-3 (15 milliunits/μl), or caspase-8 (150 milliunits/μl), in a 25 μl of total reaction volume. The reactions were attenuated with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer containing reducing agent and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were fixed, dried, and autoradiographed. Purification of Recombinant FLAG-tagged Murine Caspase-9 Protein—The recombinant plasmid, pFLAG-CTC/mC-9 was transformed into an expression host Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). The cell pellet from 250 ml of induced culture was lysed in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitor mixture, by a combination of freeze-thaw cycles and sonication, and the centrifuged supernatant was further clarified through a 0.22-μm filter (Millipore). The clarified supernatant was passed over an anti-FLAG M2 agarose affinity gel (Sigma) column several times, the column was then washed with 10–20 column volumes of Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), and bound fusion protein was eluted with six 1-ml aliquots of 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.5, into tubes containing 15–25 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Eluted fractions were concentrated using Microcon YM-30 columns (Millipore). In Vitro Kinase Assays—In vitro translated mC-9 protein or its point mutants were immunoprecipitated with either anti-Myc (Santa Cruz) or caspase-9 (NeoMarkers) antibodies and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) with or without 0.05 milliunit purified CK2, in the presence or absence of inhibitors, DRB (200 μm) heparin (28 μg/ml), and apigenin (400 μm). Kinase reactions were attenuated in Laemmli buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were fixed, dried, and autoradiographed. For kinase assays with untagged human and mouse caspase-9, in vitro translated products were immunoprecipitated with caspase-9 antibody prior to the kinase reaction. FL5.12 cell lysates (5 μg of protein), prepared as described by Desagher et al. (25Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Magnenat E. Vilbois F. Hochmann A. Journot L. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), were incubated with 5 μg of purified recombinant mC-9-FLAG for 20 min at 30 °C in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP with or without inhibitors. The inhibitors used were as follows: 60 μm emodin, 400 μm apigenin, 1 μm wortmannin, 100 μm cold GTP, or 7 μg/ml heparin. The protein was then immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. To determine caspase-9 autoprocessing in a cell-free system, 5 μl of a 25-μl cold kinase reaction were incubated alone, with caspase-9-/- cytosolic S100 extract (2Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar) (50 μg) or with extract, plus 1 mm ATP and 0.2 μg of cyt c in Buffer A (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in a total volume of 35 μl. The reactions were carried out for 30 min at 30 °C attenuated with Laemmli Buffer and Western blotted using anti-caspase-9 antibody (Stressgen). Phosphorylation of caspase-9 was confirmed in Western blots using anti-phosphoserine antibodies (Qiagen). Cell Viability Assays—FL5.12 cells were harvested at regular intervals following the addition of TNF-α (5 ng/ml) and CHX (20 μg/ml) to the medium, and viability was determined by flow cytometric analysis of annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide uptake. Inhibitors such as okadaic acid (1 μm), DRB (50 μm), or TBB (25 μm) were added 30 min to 3 h prior to the addition of TNF-α as indicated. Viability of shRNA transfectants was determined 24 h after withdrawal from IL-3-containing medium or exposure to 100 μm etoposide. Western Blotting, Metabolic Labeling, and Immunoprecipitation—Cell pellets were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g to remove cellular debris. For Western blotting experiments, equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membrane blocking, washing, primary and secondary antibody incubations, and chemiluminescent detection were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blots were stripped for reuse by washing for 30 min to 2 h in TBS-T buffer (pH 2.5) at room temperature. For the metabolic labeling experiments, FL5.12 cells were incubated with 0.5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences) in phosphate-free medium in the presence or absence of DRB (50 μm) for 6 h at 37 °C. For apoptosis induction experiments, TNF-α/CHX or CHX alone were added to the culture medium 3 h following the addition of orthophosphate, and cells were incubated for an additional 3 h prior to harvesting. The cell pellets were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in NET-I buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 0.1% Igepal) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed in NET-I and eluted directly into gel loading buffer. Eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and first visualized by autoradiography. Total immunoprecipitated full-length and cleaved caspase-9 was detected by immunoblotting the membrane with the antibody against caspase-9 (Stressgen). Caspase Activity Assays—The cells (5 × 106) were harvested following treatment with TNF-α (5 ng/ml) and CHX (20 μg/ml) for the time indicated, and the phosphate-buffered saline washed cell pellets were flash-frozen. Later, the pellets were thawed on ice for 10 min in 160 μl of lysis buffer with intermittent vortexing, centrifuged for 1 min at 10,600 × g, and tested for caspase activity in a colorimetric assay using LEHD-pNA (R & D Systems) as substrate. The reactions were allowed to develop for 2 h at 37 °C, and absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Caspase-9 null mouse embryo fibroblasts were grown to 50% confluency in 8-chamber culture slides (BD Falcon). The cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of pCDNA 3.1, m-C-9 myc, or mutants LDAD (Ser348 to Ala) or SEPA (Asp353 to Ala), using 1 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) per well in serum-free medium. After ∼48 h the cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with ice cold methanol:acetone (1:1). After blocking in 1% bovine serum albumin, the permeabilized cells were incubated with anti-caspase-9 antibody for 1 h, then washed, and incubated with Alexa 488-tagged goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen). The mounting medium (Vectastain) contained 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole for visualizing nuclei. Fluorescence was visualized simultaneously with bright field optics using a FluoView 1000 Olympus multiphoton microscope. CK2 Phosphorylates Murine Caspase-9 on Ser348 in Vitro—Previous studies from our laboratory had determined that activated caspase-9 contributed to early amplification of the death receptor pathway in type II murine cells (6McDonnell M.A. Wang D. Khan S.M. Vander Heiden M.G. Kelekar A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), independent of cyt c release. This likely involved cleavage at the auto-processing motif, SEPD (residues 350–353 in murine caspase-9; Fig. 1A), which serves as the primary substrate site for processing by active caspase-8 in vitro. We investigated the possibility that regulatory mechanisms were in place to prevent the inappropriate activation of this caspase in healthy proliferating cells. A scan of the sequence using NetPhos, a sequence- and structure-based prediction program of eukaryotic protein phosphorylation sites (24Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2514) Google Scholar), revealed the first serine residue, Ser348, within the motif TLDSDSE in murine caspase-9, CK2 (Fig. 1A). CK2 is known to phosphorylate Bid on serine residues in the vicinity of the caspase-8 recognition site, rendering it resistant to cleavage by active caspase-8 in the absence of death receptor trimerization (25Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Magnenat E. Vilbois F. Hochmann A. Journot L. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In vitro kinase reactions using purified recombinant CK2 and in vitro translated murine caspase-9 as substrate (Fig. 1B) showed that caspase-9 was indeed a CK2 target. This phosphorylation was diminished in the presence of CK2 inhibitors. Auto-phosphorylation of the CK2 β-subunit (26Sarno S. Marin O. Boschetti M. Pagano M.A. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12324-12329Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was also markedly reduced in presence of the inhibitors. Fig. 1C shows that phosphorylation was reduced at least 4-fold in the LDAD mutant (Ser348 to Ala), relative to wild type, whereas auto-phosphorylation of the CK2 β-subunit in these reactions was unchanged in the absence of the inhibitor, DRB. The immunoprecipitation/Western in the lower panel indicates that the reduced levels of phosphorylation of the LDAD mutant are not the result of decreased translation relative to caspase-9 or a failure of the immunoprecipitating caspase-9 antibody to recognize the mutant protein. The kinase assay in Fig. 1D, using the AEPD (Ser350 to Ala) mutant and an additional mutant LDVD (Ser348 to Val), demonstrated that, at least in vitro, Ser350 was not a CK2 target. We had previously shown that activated caspase-8 could process caspase-9 efficiently at the SEPD motif (Ref. 6McDonnell M.A. Wang D. Khan S.M. Vander Heiden M.G. Kelekar A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar; Fig. 1A, left arrowhead). We tested the sensitivity of some of the serine mutants in cleavage assays to determine whether Ser348 affects the ability of active caspase-8 to process caspase-9 at Asp353 in vitro. supplemental Fig. S1 shows that S348G (LDGD), S348V (LDVD), S348A (or LDAD, not shown) mutants, as well as S350A (AEPD) are all cleaved efficiently by the active initiator caspase. Murine Caspase-9 Is Phosphorylated by Endogenous CK2—Having established that Ser348 within the LDSD motif could be efficiently phosphorylated by purified recombinant CK2 enzyme in vitro, we determined whether endogenous CK2 phosphorylated the caspase-9 protein. Lysates prepared from FL5.12 pro B lymphoma cells were incubated with purified recombinant mC-9-FLAG in the absence or presence of inhibitors and immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody. Caspase-9 phosphorylation was unaffected by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, whereas specific inhibitors of CK2, such as emodin, apigenin, and GTP (27Niefind K. Putter M. Guerra B. Issinger O.G. Schomburg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1100-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), as well as heparin, which exhibits a broader specificity, all inhibited transfer of phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP to the purified recombinant protein, suggesting that CK2 was the endogenous kinase. To determine whether endogenous procaspase-9 could be phosphorylated by CK2, FL5.12 pro B lymphoma cells were incubated in the presence or absence of the CK2 inhibitor DRB (50 μm) and labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Significant reduction in caspase-9 phosphorylation observed in the presence of DRB indicates that the protein is also a substrate for CK2 in vivo. The presence of the 20-kDa fragment in the immunoprecipitation/Western of DRB-treated lysates may suggest an increased susceptibility of the hypophosphorylated caspase to processing. CK2-mediated Phosphorylation of Ser348 on Caspase-9 Interferes with Its Cleavage by Caspase-8—Caspase-9 is a tightly regulated initiator caspase in mammalian cells. It is auto-activated by induced proximity or dimerization following the release of mitochondrial cyt c and the assembly of the apoptosome in the cytosol (1Stennicke H.R. Deveraux Q.L. Humke E.W.

Previous studies in our laboratory had suggested that initiator caspase-8 cleaves and activates murine caspase-9 early during TNF receptor-induced apoptosis in murine cells. It was possible that the presence of a modified Ser348 on caspase-9 proximal to its cleavage site (see Fig. 1) inhibited the cleavage in a manner similar to that observed with pro-apoptotic protein, Bid (25Desagher S.

To test this possibility, purified recombinant mC-9-FLAG was incubated in kinase buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of recombinant CK2 and then subjected to a caspase-8 cleavage assay as described under “Experimental Procedures” and in the legends to Figs. 1 and 2. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 3A. The top panel is an autoradiograph showing caspase-9 that had been phosphorylated by CK2 in vitro, and the lower panel is the same membrane showing caspase-9 and its cleavage products detected by chemiluminescence. Phosphorylation clearly resulted in a reduction in the levels of the 38-kDa cleavage product.FIGURE 3Phosphorylation of murine caspase-9 CK2 decreases its susceptibility to cleavage by active caspase-8. A, purified caspase-9-FLAG was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in kinase buffer in the presence or absence of purified recombinant CK2. Aliquots of the kinase reactions above were used as the source of substrate in cleavage assays using active, recombinant caspase-8 protein. Attenuated reactions were SDS-PAGE-resolved, transferred to nitrocellulose, and autoradiographed to visualize phosphorylated caspase-9 (top panel). The same membrane was then immunoblotted with an antibody against caspase-9 (Stressgen) to visualize total full-length and cleaved protein and determine relative cleavage by caspase-8 of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated substrates. B, in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled mC-9 was used as substrate for phosphorylation by recombinant CK2. Kinase reactions were performed in the presence of cold ATP with or without CK2, following which caspase-8 cleavage reactions were carried out on aliquots of the kinase reactions. The results were visualized by autoradiography following resolution by SDS-PAGE. C, alternatively the kinase reactions were diluted in rehydration buffer and resolved by isoelectric focusing (IEF, pH range 5–8) in the first dimension, followed by electrophoresis in the second dimension using an 8–16% gradient.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, in vitro translated 35S-labeled caspase-9 was phosphorylated by CK2 in vitro in the presence of ATP and then subjected to an active caspase-8 cleavage assay.

https://openalex.org/W2086511169,"Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABA(A)R) are the major sites of fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain, and a critical determinant for the efficacy of neuronal inhibition is the number of these receptors that are expressed on the neuronal cell surface. GABA(A)Rs are heteropentamers that can be constructed from seven subunit classes with multiple members; alpha, beta, gamma(1-3), delta, epsilon(1-3), theta, and pi. Receptor assembly occurs within the endoplasmic reticulum, and it is evident that transport-competent combinations exiting this organelle can access the cell surface, whereas unassembled subunits are ubiquitinated and subject to proteasomal degradation. In a previous report the ubiquitin-like protein Plic-1 was shown to directly interact with GABA(A)Rs and promote their accumulation at the cell surface. In this study we explore the mechanisms by which Plic-1 regulates the membrane trafficking of GABA(A)Rs. Using both recombinant and neuronal preparations it was apparent that Plic-1 increased the stability of endoplasmic reticulum resident GABA(A)Rs together with an increase in the abundance of poly-ubiquitinated receptor subunits. Furthermore, Plic-1 elevated cell surface expression levels by selectively increasing their rates of membrane insertion. Thus, Plic-1 may play a significant role in regulating the strength of synaptic inhibition by increasing the stability of GABA(A)Rs within the secretory pathway and thereby promoting their insertion into the neuronal plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2162872530,"Do neurons in primary motor cortex encode the generative details of motor behavior, such as individual muscle activities, or do they encode high-level movement attributes? Resolving this question has proven difficult, in large part because of the sizeable uncertainty inherent in estimating or measuring the joint torques and muscle forces that underlie movements made by biological limbs. We circumvented this difficulty by considering single-neuron responses in an isometric task, where joint torques and muscle forces can be straightforwardly computed from limb geometry. The response for each neuron was modeled as a linear function of a ""preferred"" joint torque vector, and this model was fit to individual neural responses across variations in limb posture. The resulting goodness of fit suggests that neurons in motor cortex do encode the kinetics of motor behavior and that the neural response properties of ""preferred direction"" and ""gain"" are dual components of a unitary response vector."

PRL belongs to a family of homologous proteins comprising PRL, growth hormone (GH), and placental lactogen (PL). The biological effects associated with this cytokine family are mediated by two distinct classes of cell surface receptors, the PRL receptors (PRLR) and the GH receptors (GHR). The PRL/PL/GH biology is governed by a delicate balance between receptor cross-reactivity and selectivity; PRL and PL bind selectively to PRLR, whereas GH is capable of binding both PRLR and GHR. After being proposed more than a decade ago (1Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), hormone-induced receptor dimerization became generally accepted as the model for cytokine receptor activation. For the PRL family members, the model describes the signaling molecular entity as a ternary complex between one hormone molecule and a receptor homodimer assembled in a strictly sequential and hormone-dependent fashion; first the hormone ligand engages via binding site 1 (BS1) in high affinity binding to one receptor chain forming a 1:1 hormone-receptor complex. This complex constitutes the template for binding a second, identical receptor molecule via binding site 2 (BS2), resulting in the active 1:2 complex. However, the model has been challenged by an increasing body of experimental evidence, initially reported for the homologous human erythropoietin receptor (2Constantinescu S.N. Keren T. Socolovsky M. Nam H.S. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4379-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and later for GHR (3Brown R.J. Adams J.J. Pelekanos R.A. Wan Y. McKinstry W.J. Palethorpe K. Seeber R.M. Monks T.A. Eidne K.A. Parker M.W. Waters M.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 814-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and PRLR (4Qazi A.M. Tsai-Morris C.H. Dufau M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 1912-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that preformed, inactive dimers exist in the absence of hormone. Thus, receptor dimerization is a necessary but not sufficient event for receptor activation and, notably, not strictly ligand-dependent. For both human erythropoietin receptor (5Seubert N. Royer Y.

Eidne K.A. Parker M.W. Waters M.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 814-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), mechanistic models have been proposed, where receptor activation involves relative rotations and movements of receptor subunits induced by hormone binding. Allosteric reorganization of the intracellular receptor domains brings associated JAK2 kinases into close proximity, allowing their activation by cross-phosphorylation. This initial activation step triggers a cascade of molecular events leading to the functional receptor response (6Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). The receptor activation mechanism involving two distinct binding sites on the hormone forms the functional basis for a class of antagonists that are characterized by possessing high BS1 and impaired BS2 binding affinities. Such molecules will occupy the receptor by forming 1:1 complexes via BS1 but fail to elicit a functional response, which requires productive interactions between BS2 and the second receptor chain. Examples of such antagonists forming hormone-receptor complexes with a 1:1 stoichiometry are GH-G120R (7Chen W.Y. Chen N.Y. Yun J. Wagner T.E. Kopchick J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the corresponding PRL analogue, PRL-G129R (8Goffin V. Kinet S. Ferrag F. Binart N. Martial J.A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16573-16579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Since wild type PRL (wtPRL) is able to stimulate proliferation of tumor cells, molecules capable of antagonizing the effect of wtPRL are potentially anti-cancer agents (9Chen N.Y. Holle L. Li W. Peirce S.K. Beck M.T. Chen W.Y. Int. J. Oncol. 2002; 20: 813-818PubMed Google Scholar) and have received considerable attention. Detailed structural information about the interaction between GH and the extracellular domain (ECD) of its receptor has been available since 1992, when de Vos et al. (10de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2023) Google Scholar) reported the x-ray structure of the 1:2 complex between GH and GHR-ECD, providing evidence for the receptor activation mechanism involving a ternary complex between one hormone and two receptor molecules. Subsequently, several experimentally determined structures of GH and variants thereof, both free and in complex with receptor molecules, have been reported. This abundant structural information has formed the basis of the successful rational design of GH analogues with desired properties, including antagonists and superagonists (11Lowman H.B. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 564-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The ensemble of published GH complex structures includes a crystal structure of a BS2-inhibited variant (GH-G120R) in a 1:1 complex with PRLR-ECD (12Somers W. Ultsch M. de Vos A.M. Kossiakoff A.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The only other structure in the Protein Data Bank including PRLR molecules is that of the complex between ovine PL and two molecules of the extracellular domain of the rat PRLR (13Elkins P.A.

Corresponding 1:1 or 1:2 complex structures of the PRL/PRLR system have not been reported, and experimental structures of free PRL molecules became available only quite recently.

Due to the limited structural characterization of the PRL/PRLR system, design of improved PRLR antagonists has relied on homology models of the hPRL·PRLR complex, built using the available GH and PL complex structures as templates. The present characterization of the PRL·PRLR-ECD complexes is a significant contribution to the molecular description of the interaction between PRL and PRLR, with the crystal structure serving as an important tool in the design and development of novel PRL molecules. Expression and Purification of wtPRL, PRL Variants, and PRLR-ECD—In addition to wtPRL, two PRL variants, PRLv1 and PRLv2, were produced for hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry (HX-MS), NMR, and x-ray studies: PRLv1 (Met-PRL-(1-199) G129R) and PRLv2 (PRL-(12-199) Q12S/G129R). PRLv3 (PRL-(10-199) C11S/G129R) refers to the variant crystallized by Jomain et al. (16Jomain J.B. Tallet E. Broutin I. Hoos S. van Agthoven J. Ducruix A. Kelly P.A. Kragelund B.B. England P. Goffin V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33118-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). PRLR-ECD refers to Ser-hPRL receptor-(1-210). Proteins were produced in E. coli as inclusion bodies, refolded, and purified by standard methods (supplemental material). Proteins were characterized by various analytical methods, including reversed phase HPLC, MS, and tryptic digest, and further analyzed for the presence of multimers using SDS-PAGE (reduced and nonreduced) and size exclusion HPLC. The presence of deamidation species was measured by isoelectric focusing gels and ion exchange HPLC. HX-MS—Buffer change and concentration in HX-MS and NMR experiments were conducted using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter devices (cut-off 10,000 Da; Millipore). Reported pH values for buffers containing 2H2O are uncorrected for the deuterium effect. Amide hydrogen (1H/2H) exchange was initiated by a 10-fold dilution of PRLv2 in the absence or presence of PRLR-ECD into deuterated buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 99% 2H2O, pH 7.4). All exchange reactions were carried out at 30 °C and contained 6 μm PRLv2 in the absence or presence of 12 μm PRLR-ECD. At appropriate time intervals, aliquots of the exchange reaction were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold quenching buffer (1.25 m tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, adjusted to pH 2.0 using NaOH), resulting in a final pH of 2.5. Quenched samples were run on a cooled HPLC-mass spectrometry system for rapid desalting and mass analysis, as described previously (17Rand K.D. Jorgensen T.J.D. Olsen O.H. Persson E. Jensen O.N. Stennicke H.R. Andersen M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23018-23024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Peptic peptides were identified in separate experiments using standard MS/MS methods on a Q-TOF2 instrument (Waters Inc.). The hydrogen exchange time course of 27 peptides, covering 90% of the primary sequence of PRLv2, was monitored. Average masses of peptide isotopic envelopes were determined from lockmass-corrected centroided data (processed using MassLynx software; Waters Inc.). Complete deuteration of control samples was achieved by incubation for 6 h at 90 °C. Average back-exchange (i.e. deuterium loss) was measured to be ∼15-20% for the analyzed peptides. However, since only the relative levels of deuterium incorporation were compared for all samples, no correction was made for this deuterium loss. Preparation of NMR Samples—Samples of [2H,15N]PRLv1 and [2H,13C,15N]PRLv1 were prepared in 5 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 1 mm sodium azide, and 10% (v/v) 2H2O, pH 8.0 (NMR buffer). The complex between [2H,15N]PRLv1 (or [2H,13C,15N]PRLv1) and PRLR-ECD was prepared by mixing 1 mg/ml solutions (5 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) of [2H,15N]PRLv1 (or [2H,13C,15N]PRLv1) and PRLR-ECD in a molar ratio of 1:1.2. Excess PRLv1 was removed from the binary complex by gel filtration in ammonium bicarbonate buffer using a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare). Finally, the complex was exchanged into the NMR buffer and concentrated to a final protein concentration of ∼200 μm. For the cross-saturation experiments, the NMR buffer contained 90-95% 2H2O in order to quench potential amide proton-mediated spin diffusion in [2H,15N]PRLv1. NMR Experiments—NMR experiments were recorded at 35 °C on a Bruker Avance 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a room temperature triple resonance probe. Two-dimensional 1H,15N-HSQC, two-dimensional 1H,15N-TROSY, 15N-edited three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC, three-dimensional HNCO, three-dimensional HNCA, three-dimensional HNCOCA, three-dimensional HNCACB, and three-dimensional HNCOCACB spectra were recorded using standard Bruker pulse sequences. Cross-saturation experiments were recorded essentially as described previously (18Takahashi H. Nakanishi T. Kami K. Arata Y. Shimada I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). X-ray Crystallography—The 1:1 complex between PRLv2 and PRLR-ECD was prepared and purified as described above for preparation of the PRLv1 complex for NMR studies, followed by concentration to 9.5 mg/ml (2 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.9). The PRLv2·PRLR-ECD complex was crystallized by the hanging drop method at 22 °C using a precipitant solution containing 3.5 m NaCl and 0.1 m Hepes buffer, pH 7.5. Hexagonally shaped crystals appeared in a few days and grew to dimensions of ∼200 × 200 × 150 μm. Crystals were directly flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Crystallographic data were collected at 100 K using beam line BLI911-3 (19Ursby T. Mammen C.B. Cerenius Y. Svensson C. Sommarin B. Fodje M.N. Kvick Å. Logan D.T. Als-Nielsen J. Thunnissen M.M.G.M.

Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3233) Google Scholar), and the structure was determined by the molecular replacement method and refined as detailed in the supplemental material. Data collection and refinement statistics are seen in Table 1. Data were initially used to 2.0 Å resolution, based on a 2.0I/σ(I) cut-off or better, but subsequently limited to 2.5 Å resolution based on Rcryst and refinement statistics. A total of 91.8% of the residues in the complex are in the favored region of the Ramachandran plot, 6.6% in the allowed region and 1.4% in the outlier region as calculated by the program RAMPAGE (21Lovell S.C.

The outliers are Arg-16 and Asp-17 in PRLv2 and Glu-45, Cys-51, and Pro-203 in PRLR-ECD, of which all, except for Cys-51, are situated in flexible regions. Coordinates for the PRLv2·PRLR-ECD structure have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession code 3D48. Graphical representations of molecular structures were created by Pymol (W. L.

Although the crystal structure contains by far the most detailed information, the solution state techniques (HX-MS and NMR) provide measures of dynamic properties in solution in terms of NMR chemical shifts and amide proton exchange rates, which are modulated by receptor binding. Thus, HX-MS and NMR provide important complementary information in linking the free and bound states of the hormone. HX-MS Analyses of PRLv2 in the Absence and Presence of PRLR-ECD—HX-MS is a sensitive method for probing protein structure and dynamics in solution. In particular, protein-protein complex formation is readily detected by comparing deuterium incorporation in the absence and presence of ligand (23Garcia R.A. Pantazatos D. Villarreal F.J. Assay Drug Dev. Technol. 2004; 2: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We investigated the hydrogen exchange profile of PRLv2 in the absence and presence of PRLR-ECD by monitoring 27 peptides, covering 90% of the primary sequence of PRLv2. Receptor binding resulted in a pronounced decrease in exchange of several peptides of PRLv2 (Fig. 1A). Since PRLv2 exclusively binds PRLR-ECD via BS1, the regional reductions in exchange report on peptides that comprise or are conformationally linked to BS1. Decreased deuterium incorporation was primarily confined to peptides covering helix 1 and helix 4 and with a particularly pronounced protection from exchange observed in peptides of the short helix 1″ and the C-terminal Cys-191-Cys-199 segment (Fig. 1B). Remarkably, the exchange of peptides covering helix 2 and 3 also exhibited moderate protection upon complex formation, however only after prolonged exchange (10,000-100,000 s; Fig. 1B). This exchange behavior implies a ligand-induced conformational stabilization occurring outside the binding interface (23Garcia R.A. Pantazatos D. Villarreal F.J. Assay Drug Dev. Technol. 2004; 2: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We rule out binding of a second PRLR-ECD molecule at BS2 as an explanation for the altered exchange properties of the helix 2 and 3 residues, because the effects were also observed without an excess of PRLR-ECD (data not shown). We conclude that the complex truly is of 1:1 stoichiometry. Furthermore, we compared the exchange kinetics of PRLv2 with that of wtPRL, both in the absence of PRLR-ECD. The exchange profiles were largely identical; however, wtPRL showed significantly reduced exchange, relative to PRLv2, in a short segment (residues 16-22) of the N-terminal part of helix 1 (data not shown). This indicates that PRLv2 is destabilized in this region, which is important for BS2. NMR Analyses of PRLv1 in the Absence and Presence of PRLR-ECD—The solution structure of wtPRL determined by NMR spectroscopy was first reported by Keeler et al. (14Keeler C. Dannies P.S. Hodsdon M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 1105-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the accuracy of the proposed structure was questioned, and an improved model was established by Teilum et al. (15Teilum K. Hoch J.C. Goffin V. Kinet S. Martial J.A. Kragelund B.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 810-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Due to the biophysical properties of PRL, NMR data were recorded at pH 8 and 37 °C in the work by Teilum et al. Similar conditions (pH 8, 35 °C) were applied in the present study, and high quality NMR data were obtained for PRLv1 both in its unbound state and complexed with PRLR-ECD. Backbone assignments for free PRLv1 and PRLv1 complexed with PRLR-ECD were established using 2H,13C,15N-labeled PRlv1 by standard assignment experiments. The extent of assignment for the complex structure was as follows: 84% for backbone amide proton, nitrogen, and α-carbon; 73% for β-carbon; and 82% for backbone carbonyl. A 1H,15N correlation spectrum was recorded for the 1:1 complex between [2H,15N]PRLv1 and PRLR-ECD, and a reference spectrum was acquired for free [2H,15N]PRLv1 under identical conditions. The resonance assignments served for calculation of chemical shift differences between backbone amide protons in PRLv1 in the free and receptor-bound states. The NMR data are presented in Fig. 2A and compared with x-ray data in Fig. 2B. Under the high pH and high temperature conditions applied, NMR signals for amide groups were absent in several flexible stretches of the polypeptide chain due to fast, base-catalyzed exchange of the amide protons. Save for Ile-3, 5Residue abbreviations without and with subscript R refer to the PRL and PRLR-ECD sequences, respectively. no amide resonances were observed for residues 1-15 in wtPRL (15Teilum K. Hoch J.C. Goffin V. Kinet S. Martial J.A. Kragelund B.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 810-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This is also the case for PRLv1, both free and in complex with PRLR-ECD, which indicates that the intrinsically flexible N terminus is not involved in or significantly influenced by BS1 binding. Also included in the NMR silent regions in PRLv1 are a significant part of loop 1 between helix 1 and helix 2 (Gly-47-Lys-69), a part of the loop connecting helix 3 and helix 4 (Ser-151-Gln-157), and two residues in the C-terminal segment (Asn-196-Asn-197). As shown in Fig. 2A, several residues, for which the amide proton signal is absent in the free state, display amide proton resonances in PRLv1 complexed with PRLR-ECD, indicating that these regions become shielded, structurally stabilized, or, by some other means, protected from solvent exchange upon complex formation. Collectively, the observed changes in chemical shifts and amide proton exchange rates point particularly to two dynamic regions, Ile-51-Ser-57 and Asn-197-Cys-199, as being important for receptor interaction. Due to fast amide proton exchange in the free state, chemical shift differences are not available for Lys-53, Ala-54, Asn-56, Ser-57, Cys-58, Asn-196, and Asn-197, but neighboring residues, in particular Thr-52, Ile-55, Asn-198, and Cys-199, exhibit strong perturbations. Of note, the backbone amide proton of Asn-56 appears in the complex markedly deshielded, exhibiting an unusual downfield chemical shift of 10.4 ppm. For a more direct mapping of the contact surface between PRLv1 and PRLR-ECD the NMR cross-saturation method (18Takahashi H. Nakanishi T. Kami K. Arata Y. Shimada I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) was applied. The data (not shown) confirmed the importance of the Ile-51-Ser-57 and C-terminal segments, as suggested by the NMR chemical shift perturbation and HX-MS data. Crystal Structure of PRLv2 Bound to PRLR-ECD—Hexagonally shaped crystals of the complex between PRLv2 and PRLR-ECD were obtained using the hanging drop method. The structure was determined by the molecular replacement method, and the overall crystal structure of the 1:1 complex is shown in Fig. 3. The secondary structural elements found in the crystal structure of receptor bound PRLv2 are similar to those of free PRLv3 (Protein Data Bank code 2Q98) (16Jomain J.B. Tallet E. Broutin I. Hoos S. van Agthoven J. Ducruix A. Kelly P.A. Kragelund B.B. England P. Goffin V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33118-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Present are the characteristic four main α-helices, denoted helix 1-4 (Leu-15-Phe-40, Gln-77-Val-102, Ile-112-Gln-136, and Glu-161-Ile-193, respectively) and connected by loops 1, 2, and 3. Similar to PRLv3, three short helices, helix 1′, 1″, and 3′ (residues His-59-Ser-62, Lys-69-Ala-72, and Leu-153-Leu-156, respectively), are present in loop 1 and loop 3. In the structure of the complex, an additional short helix segment, denoted helix 1b, is formed in the N-terminal part of loop 1 (Ile-51-Ala-54). Due to weak or absent electron density, part of the N-terminal segment of loop 1 (Arg-43-Arg-48), the short loop 2 (Gly-104-Glu-110), the N-terminal part of the long loop 3 (His-138-Glu-145), and Cys-199 in PRLv2 have been omitted from the model of the complex. In contrast, for free PRLv3, the complete sequence was modeled into the electron density (16Jomain J.B. Tallet E. Broutin I. Hoos S. van Agthoven J. Ducruix A. Kelly P.A. Kragelund B.B. England P. Goffin V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33118-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, in the crystal structure of PRLv3, more than half of the residues (100 residues) are within a 5-Å distance of symmetry related molecules, resulting in stabilization of the flexible loops. Loop-stabilizing crystal packing interactions are less abundant for PRLv2 in the complex structure, and apparent differences in the flexibility of the loop segments between the free and bound forms can be explained mainly by crystal packing effects. The structure of PRLR-ECD (Fig. 3) reveals the characteristic tandem repeat of fibronectin type III modules, D1 and D2 (residues 1-98 and 104-210, respectively), connected by a short interdomain linker (residues 99-103). The relative domain orientation is very similar to that observed for GHR-ECD in published 1:1 and 2:1 complexes with GH and variants but distinctively different from that of PRLR-ECD in complex with GH (12Somers W. Ultsch M. de Vos A.M. Kossiakoff A.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The surface that becomes buried at the interface between PRLv2 and PRLR-ECD covers an area of ∼1200 Å2. Two essential tryptophan residues in PRLR-ECD, Trp-72R and Trp-139R, dock on PRLv2 in an extended hydrophobic groove lined by helix 4 and minihelix 1″ (Fig. 4). Besides the contact residues belonging to helix 1 (His-27, His-30, Asn-31), helix 4 (His-173, Arg-176, Arg-177, His-180, Lys-181, Asp-183, Asn-184, Tyr-185, Lys-187, Leu-188, Cys-191, and Arg-192) and the C-terminal half of loop 1 (Pro-66, Glu-67, Asp-68, Lys-69, Glu-70, Ala-72, and Gln-73), additional contact regions are situated in the N-terminal part of loop 1, including Ile-51, Thr-52, Ala-54, Ile-55, and Asn-56 (Fig. 5), and in the C terminus (Asn-197 and Asn-198).FIGURE 5Structure of the N-terminal part of loop 1 in PRLv2·PRLR-ECD. The Ile-51-Ser-57 segment of PRLv2 (cyan) interacts with residues Glu-43R, Gly-44R, Ile-76R, and Tyr-94R (yellow). Hydrogen bond interactions between Asn-56 and PRLR-ECD are indicated by red dashed lines. The green dashed lines indicate the hydrogen bonds stabilizing the β-turn (Ala-54-Ser-57) and the short helix 1b (Ile-51-Ala-54) induced by binding to PRLR-ECD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Differences observed between the structures of free PRLv3 and PRLv2 bound to PRLR-ECD are displayed in Fig. 2B. The two structures were superimposed based on Cα atoms in residues present in α-helical segments (root mean square difference of 0.54 Å for 108 Cα atoms). Evidently, the most prominent backbone shifts are in the 49-57 loop segment, which in the free state appears largely unstructured and flexible but in the complex becomes structured by specific receptor interactions involving residues Ile-51, Thr-52, Ile-55, and Asn-56 (Fig. 5). In the complex structure, Ala-54-Ser-57 forms a type II β-turn, and the Ile-51-Ala-54 segment curls up in an α-helix (H1b). This structural arrangement exposes the side chains of Ile-51 and Ile-55 for hydrophobic interaction with Tyr-94R and Ile-76R on the receptor and spatially presents Asn-56, allowing for favorable receptor interactio"
https://openalex.org/W2016137845,"Previous studies have revealed that the initial stages of memory formation require several genes involved in synaptic, transcriptional and translational mechanisms. In contrast, very little is known about the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying later stages of memory, including remote memory (i.e. 7-day memory). To identify genes required for remote memory, we screened randomly selected mouse strains harboring known mutations. In our primary reverse genetic screen, we identified 4 putative remote memory mutant strains out of a total of 54 lines analyzed. Additionally, we found 11 other mutant strains with other abnormal profiles. Secondary screens confirmed that mutations of integrin beta2 (Itgbeta2) and steryl-O-acyl transferase 1 (Soat1) specifically disrupted remote memory. This study identifies some of the first genes required for remote memory, and suggests that screens of targeted mutants may be an efficient strategy to identify molecular requirements for this process."

Bird P.I. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Coughlin P.B. Gettins P.G. Irving J.A. Lomas D.A. Luke C.J. Moyer R.W. Pemberton P.A. Remold-O'Donnell E. Salvesen G.S. Travis J. Whisstock J.C. J. Biol.

IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Like other inhibitory serpins, PCI utilizes a unique suicide mechanism for protease inactivation. In this mechanism the inhibitor exposes its reactive site in a loop on the protein surface, called the reactive center loop, RCL. The reactive site is recognized and cleaved by the protease. Instead of being released as with a normal substrate, the protease remains covalently bound to the inhibitor. The N-terminal part of the RCL is subsequently inserted as a sixth strand in β-sheet A, while the protease is dragged along the surface to the opposite pole of the serpin. The protease-inhibitor complex is inactive and rapidly cleared from the circulation (3Gettins P.G. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Protease-serpin specificity is determined by the reactive site and by exosite interactions. PCI is capable of inhibiting diverse proteases, including thrombin, thrombin bound to thrombomodulin, active protein C, factor Xa, factor XIa, plasma and tissue kallikreins, urokinase, and tissue plasminogens (4Krebs M. Uhrin P. Vales A. Prendes-Garcia M.J. Wojta J. Geiger M. Binder B.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 32-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 5Pike R.N.

Immunopharmacology. 1996; 32: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The identification of factors that restrict PCI to performing a single task instead of the several tasks it is biochemically capable of carrying out, remain elusive. Some factors have, however, been found to affect the ability of PCI to inactivate proteases. For instance, heparin and other glycosaminoglycans and polyanions activate the inhibitory potential of PCI toward most target proteases (8Kazama Y. Masahiro N. Yamagishi R. Takahashi K. Sakuragawa N. Koide T. Thromb. Res. 1987; 48: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 9Pratt C.W. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8789-8794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but can also lower the inhibitory potential, as exemplified by a decreased activity of PCI for the inhibition of tissue kallikrein (10Ecke S. Geiger M. Binder B.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 667: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Glycosaminoglycans can thus determine the activity as well as the specificity of PCI for proteases. Thrombomodulin is another compound found to affect the protease-inhibitory function of PCI by enhancing the inhibitory effect toward thrombin (11Rezaie A.R. Cooper S.T. Church F.C. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25336-25339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Because thrombin bound to thrombomodulin functions as an activator of protein C, rather than a fibrinogen-degrading enzyme, the presence of thrombomodulin favors the procoagulant effect of PCI. Although active protein C was identified as the first PCI target protease (12Marlar R.A. Griffin J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 1186-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), PCI has been reported to have considerably higher inhibitory activity toward thrombin, both in the absence and the presence of the cofactors (9Pratt C.W. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8789-8794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Elisen M.G. Maseland M.H. Church F.C. Bouma B.N. Meijers J.C. Thromb. Haemost. 1996; 75: 760-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used MALDI-TOF MS for peptide mapping and glycan structure analyses, to establish that the size heterogeneity of human blood-derived PCI is explained by differences in N-glycan structures, N-glycosylation occupancy, as well as in the length of the N terminus. Additionally we showed that PCI is O-glycosylated, but this does not contribute significantly to the size heterogeneity, because >95% of the O-glycans are either mono- or di-sialylated core type 1 structures. Furthermore, the functional effects of the N-glycans and the N terminus on protease inhibition were explored using a discontinuous assay of thrombin inhibition in the absence or presence of various concentrations of heparin or saturating concentrations of thrombomodulin. The results demonstrate that the N-glycans and the Δ6-N terminus of PCI can fine-tune the rates of cofactor-enhanced inhibition of thrombin and that solution conditions can differentially affect these inhibition rates by the PCI variants. Proteins and Saccharides—PCI was isolated from fresh-frozen human blood plasma that originated from several healthy blood donors, as described previously (14Laurell M. Carlson T.H. Stenflo J. Thromb. Haemost. 1988; 60: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 15Laurell M. Stenflo J. Thromb. Haemost. 1989; 62: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, the plasma was purified with three consecutive affinity chromatography steps. In the first step, a column with immobilized monoclonal M11-5 anti-PCI antibody was employed. The bound protein fraction, eluted with 50 mm triethylamine, 0.5 m NaCl (pH 11.5), was collected. This fraction was further applied to a 5-ml HiTrap heparin-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) and eluted with a linear gradient from 0.1–1 m NaCl. The protein fraction that bound to the column and appeared as one broad peak upon elution was collected. In the last chromatography step, an antibody specific for RCL-cleaved PCI, M36 (16Strandberg K. Kjellberg M. Erb E.M. Persson U. Mosher D.F. Villoutreix B.O. Stenflo J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15713-15720Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), immobilized on a HiTrap column, was used to separate the native inhibitor from the RCL-cleaved form. The native form did not bind to the column, whereas the cleaved form bound and was eluted with 0.1 m glycine, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 2.7. For the N-glycan structure determination PCI was further applied to a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) coupled to anÄkta explorer 10 purifier system (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. The concentration of the purified native protein fraction was determined by amino acid analysis. The homogeneity of the purified protein was investigated by 10–12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions with the Laemmli system. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or colloidal Coomassie. The identity of the resulting bands was determined with peptide mapping using MALDI-TOF MS. Quantitative analysis of gel bands was performed using the gel image analyzing software Quantity One V4.5 (Bio-Rad). Human α-thrombin was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). The active concentration, determined by titrations with 100% active human α-antithrombin (17Olson S.T. Bjork I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), was used throughout this study. Rabbit thrombomodulin was purchased from Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Size-fractionated heparin with an average mass of ∼11 kDa, derived from pig intestinal mucosa, was a gift from Prof. Ingemar Björk, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden. Peptide Mapping—Bands were excised from the Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels, washed, reduced with dithiothreitol, and alkylated with iodoacetamide. The proteins in the bands were cleaved by modified porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). The digests were analyzed by MALDI-TOF using an Ultraflex Tof/Tof instrument (Bruker). An α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix was used. Mass spectra were used for searches in NCBInr data base using Mascot search engine (Matrixsciences.com). Determined peptide masses were also compared with theoretical tryptic fragments of alkylated PCI. PNGase F Treatment for the Determination of N-Glycan Occupancy—To determine the occupation of potential N-glycosylation sites, N-glycosidically linked carbohydrate chains were removed by incubating 45 μg of PCI with PNGase F (Sigma-Aldrich) under denaturing conditions according to the standard protocol, except that the concentration of PNGase F was lower than recommended (0.96 International Union of Biochemistry milliunit). Aliquots were collected at 5 s, 1 min, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 3 h, and 24 h of incubation and snap frozen in ethanol with dry ice. The products obtained after the various time points were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by peptide mapping. In addition to Coomassie, these gels were stained with PRO-Q Emerald 300 glycoprotein gel stain and SYPRO Ruby protein gel stain (both from Invitrogen). Digestion of PCI with Trypsin Prior to N-Glycan Determination—Purified PCI was reduced in 600 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.4, containing 2 mg/ml dithiothreitol (37 °C for 45 min), and carboxymethylated by addition of 12 mg/ml iodoacetic acid (room temperature for 1 h). Carboxymethylation was terminated by dialysis against 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.5, at 4 °C for 48 h, followed by lyophilization. PCI was incubated with trypsin (Sigma) at a 50:1 ratio (w/w) in 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.4, for 16 h at 37 °C. The digestion was terminated by heating at 100 °C for 3 min, followed by C18 Sep-Pak chromatography (Waters Corp.). Bound peptides were eluted with either 20% (v/v) or 40% (v/v) propanol in 5% aqueous acetic acid, pooled, and lyophilized. Preparation of N-Glycans—PNGase F (Roche Applied Science) digestion was carried out in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, for 16 h at 37 °C with 3 Roche units of enzyme. The released N-glycans were separated from peptides by Sep-Pak C18 (Waters Corp.) as described (18Dell A. Khoo K.H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. University Press, Oxford, Oxford1993: 187-222Google Scholar). Permethylation of glycans was performed using the sodium hydroxide procedure (18Dell A. Khoo K.H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. University Press, Oxford, Oxford1993: 187-222Google Scholar). Preparation of O-Glycans—O-Linked oligosaccharides were liberated from glycopeptides by reductive elimination (400 μl of 1 m NaBH4 in 0.05 m NaOH at 45 °C for 16 h) and desalted through a Dowex 50W-X8(H) column. Excess borates were removed by co-evaporation with 10% (v/v) acetic acid in methanol under a stream of nitrogen. Desalted eluate was passed through a C18 Sep-Pak and the glycans collected in the unbound fraction. MS for Glycan Determination—MALDI-TOF data were acquired on a Voyager-DE sSTR mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) in the reflectron mode with delayed extraction. Permethylated samples were dissolved in 10 μl of 80% (v/v) methanol in water, and 1 μl of dissolved sample was pre-mixed with 1 μl of matrix (10 mg/ml 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 80% (v/v) aqueous methanol) before loading onto a metal plate. The MALDI-TOF/TOF experiments were performed on a 4800 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) operated in reflectron positive ion mode. Both 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrices (10 mg/ml in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid) were used in conjunction with setting the potential difference between the source acceleration voltage and the collision cell at 1 kV to obtain different degrees and patterns of fragmentation. PNGase F Treatment for Functional Studies—For functional studies PNGase F treatments were conducted on the native protein. In this case, 300 μg of PCI was deglycosylated with 580 International Union of Biochemistry milliunits of PNGase F (New England Biolabs), essentially as described in the standard protocol, but in the absence of heat, SDS, and β-mercaptoethanol, to maintain the native protein structure. The treated protein was purified on a 1-ml HiTrap Heparin HP column (GE Healthcare). Protein fractions were collected, and the buffer was exchanged into 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.4, by filter centrifugation with Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter devices (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Isolation of PCI Variants with Heparin-Sepharose Chromatography—To further isolate natural PCI variants a second heparin-Sepharose chromatography was employed, using a more extended NaCl gradient than in the initial purification of PCI. Running buffers were 0 and 2 m NaCl in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, in buffers A and B, respectively. A 1-ml HiTrap Heparin HP column was used. A pH gradient was additionally introduced in some experiments with pH 6.0 and 7.4 in the A and B buffers, respectively. The gradient was segmented as follows: 0 min, 0 m NaCl; 60 min, 1.2 m NaCl; 65 min, 1.6 m NaCl; 66 min, 0 m NaCl; and 70 min, 0 m NaCl. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. The column was coupled to a fast-protein liquid chromatography system, monitoring the eluant by the absorbance at 280 nm with a UV-detector. The collected protein fractions were concentrated, and the buffer was exchanged into 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.4, with Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter devices (Millipore Corp.). The protein concentration was determined with the Bradford method according to Bio-Rad, and the homogeneity of the protein fractions was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For kinetic analyses the active protein concentration was determined from the stoichiometry of thrombin inhibition. Solution Conditions for Thrombin Assays—All thrombin assays were measured in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing either 0.1 m NaCl or 0.1 m KCl at 25 °C or 37 °C. Most commonly, and if not otherwise stated, 0.1 m NaCl and 25 °C was used. Stoichiometry of Thrombin Inhibition—Active concentrations of untreated and PNGase F-treated PCI were measured as described previously for antithrombin (17Olson S.T. Bjork I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), by incubating a constant amount of thrombin with increasing amounts of PCI, covering PCI/thrombin ratios from 0 to 2 in a final thrombin concentration of ∼0.5 μm. The mixture was incubated for at least 60 min, followed by the determination of the residual activity of thrombin by quenching the reaction by a 200-fold dilution with excessive amounts (110 μm) of the substrate S2238 (Chromogenix, Mölndal, Sweden) and monitoring the increase in absorbance at 405 nm. The stoichiometries were determined in the absence of cofactor at 25 °C in physiological [Na+] and was assumed to be the same in the presence of cofactors and other solution conditions. Kinetics of Thrombin Inhibition—Bimolecular association rate constants for the inhibition of thrombin by the PCI variants were measured under pseudo-first order conditions, using a discontinuous assay (17Olson S.T. Bjork I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Thrombin (20 nm final concentration) was incubated with a 10-fold excess of PCI. After different reaction times, varying between 30 s and 50 min, aliquots were removed, and the reaction was quenched by a 10-fold dilution in the assay buffer containing 110 μm of the substrate S2238. The initial rates of the residual thrombin activity were monitored in a dual beam spectrophotometer at 405 nm and plotted against the incubation times. Observed pseudo-first order rate constants, kobs, were obtained by non-linear least squares fitting of such plots to a single exponential decay function (17Olson S.T. Bjork I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The linear dependence of kobs versus [PCI] was verified for the initial PCI preparation, giving the second order rate constant, k2. For the isolated PCI variants, second order rate constants were therefore calculated by dividing kobs by the active PCI concentration. Effects of Cofactors on the Rates of Thrombin Inhibition—The rates of thrombin inhibition by the PCI variants in the presence of heparin were measured under the same conditions as described above except that 9 nm to 9 μm heparin was added in the incubation mixtures. The dependence of kobs on the heparin concentration was computer-fitted by the following equation, described previously for the antithrombin-thrombin-heparin ternary complex (19Streusand V.J. Björk I. Gettins P.G. Petitou M. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9043-9051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), with KaleidaGraph software, kobs=kT[PCI]f+kH,T[PCI·T]×KT,HKT,H+[H]f+kH,T′[PCI·H]×[H]fKT,H+[H]f(Eq. 1) where [PCI·H]=[PCI]0+[H]0+KPCI,H−([PCI]0+[H]0+KPCI,H)2−4[PCI]0[H]02(Eq. 2) [PCI]f=[PCI]0−[PCI·H](Eq. 3) [H]f=[H]0−[PCI·H](Eq. 4) [PCI]0 and [H]0 are the total PCI and heparin concentrations, KT,H and KPCI,H are dissociation equilibrium constants for the thrombin-heparin and PCI-heparin interactions, kT, kH,T, and k′H,T are second order rate constants for the reactions of thrombin with PCI, PCI-heparin binary complex with thrombin, and the thrombin-heparin binary complex with the PCI-heparin binary complex, respectively. Measured kT values, determined by the method described above (i.e. the k2 values measured in the absence of cofactor), were used. Published values for KT,H were used, because the KD for low and high affinity heparins binding to thrombin are indistinguishable, i.e. 0.7 ± 0.1 and 0.9 ± 0.1 μm, respectively (20Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1698-1708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The thrombomodulin-catalyzed rates of thrombin inhibition by the PCI variants were measured using close to saturating concentrations of thrombomodulin (50–200 nm), based on the previously described affinity of thrombin for thrombomodulin (21Pineda A.O. Cantwell A.M. Bush L.A. Rose T. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32015-32019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thrombomodulin enhances the reactivity of thrombin with PCI by providing both a binding site for the serpin and allosterically modulating the activity of thrombin (22Yang L. Manithody C. Walston T.D. Cooper S.T. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37465-37470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that the dependence of thrombomodulin on this inhibition rate follows a bell-shaped curve (23Li W. Adams T.E. Nangalia J. Esmon C.T. Huntington J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 4661-4666Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We therefore reported the results determined at 50 nm thrombomodulin, because the values determined at 100–200 nm were somewhat lower, to ensure that we were measuring the maximal effects. Ca2+ and albumin were found not to affect these inhibition rates and, therefore, were not included in the incubation assays. Purification and Homogeneity of PCI—The isolation of PCI from human blood plasma was based on three consecutive affinity chromatography steps, two of which employ monoclonal antibodies specific for PCI. Additionally, gel chromatography on S-75 Superdex, was included prior to the N-glycoproteomics experiments. SDS-PAGE analysis of the isolated PCI fraction revealed several bands, in agreement with earlier reports (15Laurell M. Stenflo J. Thromb. Haemost. 1989; 62: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), demonstrating a substantial size heterogeneity of the PCI fraction. We therefore ran a number of SDS-PAGE gels to achieve a better separation between these bands, resulting in the identification of at least six apparent bands (see the first lane of Fig. 1A). The same band pattern was observed in two different PCI preparations, each derived from several blood donors. To identify these bands, PCI was subjected to SDS-PAGE in a large (18 × 16 cm) gel, and the resulting bands were analyzed by peptide mapping. Mascot search results gave probability based Mowse scores between 110 and 200 for all bands, verifying that all the bands were PCI. No other proteins could be detected. Bands 1–6 constituted ∼16, 23, 41, 15, 3, and 3%, respectively. N-Glycosylation Site Occupancy—To determine the N-glycosylation site occupancy, PCI was treated with PNGase F under denaturing conditions. This enzyme cleaves the linkage between the asparagine on the core protein and the attached oligosaccharide for all types of mammalian N-glycans. The released sugar chain remains intact, whereas the asparagine residue, to which the sugar had been attached, becomes deaminated to aspartic acid (24Medzihradszky K.F. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 405: 116-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Peptides containing N-linked glycan sites, from which the sugar had been removed, could thus be identified by a one mass unit higher mass than predicted from the amino acid sequence. The SDS-PAGE band pattern after treatment with PNGase F at different time points is shown in Fig. 1. The deglycosylation process started immediately, because the first aliquot that was removed (5 s in Fig. 1A) already showed a shift in the gel band pattern toward lower molecular weights. Bands 1–6 from the untreated PCI sample and bands 7–13 from the deglycosylated samples were analyzed by peptide mapping. Bands 7–12 were composed of mixtures of products, being partially deglycosylated by the enzyme. The presence or absence of signals of peptides from bands 1–6 and 13, containing the N-glycosylation sites and the N terminus, are shown in Fig. 2. The absence of a signal corresponding to the potential N-glycosylation site peptide in the untreated sample combined with appearance of the corresponding signal with one mass unit increment after PNGase F treatment, verifies that the N-glycosylation site in that sequence was originally occupied (Fig. 2). For bands 1–4, none of the peptides containing N-glycosylation sites were detected. For band 5 the peptide containing the Asn-243 glycosylation site was detected with a small signal in one experiment but was absent in another experiment. For band 6, the peptide containing the Asn-243-glycosylation site was detected in both experiments. We therefore assumed that the detection of the Asn-243-containing peptide in band 5 in one of the experiments was due to contamination from band 6, which is a reasonable assumption considering the proximity of the bands in the gel. Band 13 contained all three predicted N-glycosylated peptides with a one mass unit shift. The results thus show that all N-glycans were efficiently removed in band 13 of the treated sample and that the proteins in bands 1–5 from the untreated sample are glycosylated at all three N-glycosylation sites, whereas band 6 lacks the N-glycan attached to Asn-243. Although more than two bands can be visualized at the 24-h time point in Fig. 1A, most repeated experiments gave only two final products. Interestingly, staining with PRO-Q Emerald 300 glycoprotein gel stain gave a signal in band 13, although migration behavior and peptide mapping showed that all the N-linked glycans were removed in this band (Fig. 1B). These findings indicate that PCI contains O-linked glycans, in addition to the N-linked glycans. This was confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis of glycans released by alkaline elimination (see later). Detection of N-terminally Cleaved PCI—Another explanation for the size heterogeneity of PCI was the partial cleavage of the N terminus. For bands 1–3 and 6 the ion at m/z 546.3 corresponding to the peptide HHPR was detected, whereas the peptide maps of the bands 4 and 5 lacked this signal (Fig. 2). These results show that an N-terminal fragment is lacking in a fraction of the isolated PCI and are in agreement with a previous study (15Laurell M. Stenflo J. Thromb. Haemost. 1989; 62: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which showed that a portion of PCI isolated from fresh human plasma is cleaved at the N terminus, lacking the six most N-terminal amino acid residues, HRHHPR. Further size heterogeneity, as observed for instance among bands 1–3, is likely to be caused by differences in the N-glycan structures. This was confirmed by structure analysis experiments described in the following section. MALDI-MS Analysis of N-Glycans Released from PCI—Purified PCI from human blood plasma was reduced/carboxymethylated and tryptically digested to facilitate deglycosylation with PNGase F. The released glycans were separated from peptides and were analyzed by MALDI-MS after permethylation and Sep-Pak purification (Fig. 3). The spectrum indicates that PCI N-glycans have compositions consistent with complex type bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary glycans with (NeuAc1–4Fuc0–2Hex5–7Hex-NAc4–6). The most abundant ion (m/z 2791) has a composition (NeuAc2Hex5HexNAc4) consistent with a non-fucosylated bi-antennary glycan with both antennae capped with sialic acid (Fig. 3). Thus blood-derived PCI appears to be differently glycosylated to urinary PCI, which is reported to carry core fucose on >60% of its glycans (25Izutani W. Fujita M. Nishizawa K. Koga J. Thromb. Res. 2001; 104: 65-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Googl"
https://openalex.org/W2134734712,"Pregnancy in mice and rats is associated with the production of a large family of hormones/cytokines related to prolactin (PRL). The hormones/cytokines are hypothesized to coordinate maternal and fetal adaptations to pregnancy. In this study, PRL-like protein-J (PLP-J, also known as PRL family 3, subfamily c, member 1 (Prl3c1)) is shown to be a product of the uterine decidua and a regulator of postimplantation intrauterine events. PLP-J-specific antibodies and a series of recombinant PLP-J proteins were generated and used to investigate PLP-J expression and as ligands for investigating biological targets. Decidual PLP-J migrates as a 29-kDa protein and localizes to a band of decidual cells surrounding the trophoblast cell layer on gestation day 8.5. PLP-J ligands specifically bound in situ to the surrounding uterine stromal cells and vasculature within the decidua of gestation day 8.5 implantation sites. We then investigated the in vitro actions of PLP-J on uterine stromal cells and endothelial cells. PLP-J specifically interacted with both cell populations. PLP-J promoted uterine stromal cell proliferation and inhibited endothelial cell proliferation. We determined that PLP-J does not interact with PRL receptors. Instead, PLP-J interacts with heparin-containing molecules, including syndecan-1, which is expressed in gestation day 8.5 pregnant uteri, as well as in uterine stromal cells and endothelial cells. The restricted expression of PLP-J and its specific interactions with uterine stromal cells and endothelial cells suggests that it acts locally and regulates decidual cell development and the endometrial vasculature.

Successful pregnancy requires specialized maternal adaptations. Decidualization is a key uterine adaptation associated with the establishment of pregnancy and is characterized by the differentiation of uterine stromal cells (1DeFeo V.J. Wynn R.M. Cellular Biology of the Uterus. Appleton-Century-Crofts, New York1967: 191-220Google Scholar, 2Aplin J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 3Bell S.C.

Decidual cell differentiation is dependent upon ovarian steroid hormone production, and in rodents, it also requires signals emanating from the preimplantation embryo (1DeFeo V.J. Wynn R.M. Cellular Biology of the Uterus. Appleton-Century-Crofts, New York1967: 191-220Google Scholar, 5Parr M.B. Parr E.L. Wynn R.M. Jollie W.P. Biology of the Uterus. Plenum Press, New York1989: 233-278Crossref Google Scholar). Once formed, decidual cells establish a protective environment, facilitating the development of the placenta and embryo. They promote the redistribution of specific populations of leukocytes and reorganize the uterine vascular network. Intercellular signals elaborated by decidual cells are key mediators of these uterine adaptive responses. Among the decidual cell ligands are a family of cytokines related to prolactin (PRL). 2The abbreviations used are: PRL, prolactin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; AP, alkaline phosphatase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FGF2, fetal growth factor 2; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine. 2The abbreviations used are: PRL, prolactin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; AP, alkaline phosphatase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FGF2, fetal growth factor 2; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine.PRL is an ancient hormone with its origins as a regulator of vertebrate environmental adaptations (6Bern H.A.

Churchill Livingstone, London1972: 299-338Google Scholar). Some species possess a single member of the PRL family that can be expressed in an assortment of tissues, including the anterior pituitary and uterus through the utilization of cell-specific promoters (8DiMattia G.E.

The PRL family genes encode cytokines/hormones that are expressed in cell-specific and temporally specific patterns and are most relevant to pregnancy-associated tissues, especially in the uterine decidua and the placenta. Initial observations suggest that the expanded PRL family participates in pregnancy-dependent adaptations to physiological stressors (15Ain R. Dai G. Dunmore J.H. Godwin A.R. Soares M.J. Proc. Natl.

Although a few members are PRL mimetics (placental lactogens), activating PRL receptor signaling cascades, most utilize distinct strategies to regulate their cellular targets (11Soares M.J. Konno T.

The expression of PLP-J is significantly decreased in dPRP null mice, suggesting that the biology of dPRP and PLP-J may be linked. Information on the biological functions of PLP-J is not available.In this study, we have characterized the PLP-J protein and its expression pattern, identified targets for its action, and determined biological responses of its cellular targets. PLP-J is a heparin-binding cytokine with distinct actions on uterine stromal cell and endothelial cell populations.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals and Tissue PreparationHoltzman rats were obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley Inc. (Indianapolis, IN). The animals were housed in an environmentally controlled facility, with lights on from 0600 to 2000 h and were allowed free access to food and water. Timed pregnancies were generated, and tissue dissections were performed as previously detailed (40Ain R. Konno T. Canham L.N. Soares M.J. Methods Mol. Med. 2006; 121: 295-313PubMed Google Scholar). Conceptuses with associated uteri were removed on specific days of gestation. Tissues were frozen in dry ice-cooled heptane and stored at -80 °C until used for in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and in situ ligand binding or were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C for subsequent RNA and protein analyses. The presence of sperm in the vaginal smear was designated as day 0.5 of pregnancy. New Zealand White rabbits were obtained from Myrtle's Rabbitry (Thompsons Station, TN) and used for antibody production. Protocols for the care and use of animals were approved by the University of Kansas Animal Care and Use Committee.Cell CultureU1 rat uterine stromal cells were obtained from Dr. Virginia Rider (Pittsburg State University, Pittsburg, KS) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (41Piva P. Flieger O. Rider V. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 1333-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 42Rider V. Methods Mol. Med. 2006; 121: 57-67PubMed Google Scholar). These rat uterine stromal cells are physiologically relevant in that they can be induced to differentiate into decidual cells (43Rider V. Potapova T. Dai G. Soares M.J. J. Endocrinol. 2005; 184: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Rat aortic endothelial cells were purchased from VEC Technologies, Inc. (Rensselaer, NY) and maintained in MCDB-131 complete culture medium. The rat Nb2 lymphoma cell line was provided by Dr. Peter Gout (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada) and maintained in RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 10% FBS, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm l-glutamine, 5 mm HEPES, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) (44Tanaka T. Shiu R.P. Gout P.W. Beer C.T. Noble R.L. Friesen H.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1980; 51: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and used as a host for the expression of the PLP-J fusion proteins. HEK 293 cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). CHO cells and heparan sulfate-deficient CHO-pgsD-677 cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in DMEM/MCDB 302 culture medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FBS. Raji cells stably transfected with a syndecan-1 (Sdc1) expression vector (Raji-S1) and the parent Raji cell line were obtained from Dr. Alan C. Rapraeger (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) and were maintained in RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics (45Lebakken C.S. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All cell cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C.Generation of Fusion ProteinsmFLAG-PLP-J—PLP-J was expressed as a fusion protein with a FLAG-His6-FLAG tag. The full-length mature rat PLP-J cDNA was used as a template for PCR amplification of a PLP-J fragment with EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, using sequence specific primers, 5′-cat tta aag aat tca cac cat atg acc aga tgt-3′ and 5′-gtt ata tgt ttc tag att acc act tgt taa taa tg-3′. After digestion with EcoRI and XbaI restriction enzymes, the fragment was ligated into a modified pFLAG-CMV-3 vector (mFLAG; Sigma). The accuracy of vector construction was verified by DNA sequencing. The mFLAG-PLP-J plasmid was transfected into HEK 293 cells using Lipofectamine Plus according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The initial selection of transfected cells was accomplished in the presence of G418 at a concentration of 500 μg/ml. Selected cells were then maintained in 100 μg/ml G418.The mFLAG-PLP-J fusion protein was purified from serum-free conditioned medium by incubating with an Ni2+-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). In brief, Ni2+-NTA-agarose was equilibrated with Sorensen's phosphate buffer (NaH2PO4 (66 mm) and KH2PO4 (66 mm)) and added to conditioned medium in a buffer containing 10 mm imidazole, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 8.0 (1× binding buffer), incubated overnight at 4 °C with constant shaking. The resin was then transferred into a column and washed with 2× binding buffer. Recombinant mFLAG-PLP-J protein was eluted with 250 mm imidazole and 0.15 m NaCl in Sorensen's phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. Aliquots of fractions were separated using SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue G-250 and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). Immunopositive fractions were pooled and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and concentrated by Centricon ultrafiltration centrifugation devices (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Purified proteins were sterilized using Millex filters (Millipore), and concentrations were determined with the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad).Alkaline Phosphatase (AP)-PLP-J Fusion Protein (AP-PLP-J)—The full-length cDNA for mature rat PLP-J was ligated downstream of heat-stable human placental AP of pCMV-SEAP and then transfected into HEK 293 cells, as previously described (46Müller H. Dai G. Soares M.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 47Müller H. Soares M.J. Methods Mol. Med. 2006; 122: 331-340PubMed Google Scholar). The transfected cells were selected and maintained in DMEM/F-12 culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS and G418 as described above. Cells were transferred to serum-free culture medium for 72 h. Conditioned medium was collected, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 2,200 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and then stored at -20 °C. AP activity was quantified by a colorimetric assay at 405 nm using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as an AP substrate (47Müller H. Soares M.J. Methods Mol. Med. 2006; 122: 331-340PubMed Google Scholar). AP fusion proteins were also separated using SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose, and AP activity was detected by incubation with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate.Preparation of PLP-J AntibodiesAntibodies directed to PLP-J were prepared by immunizing rabbits with recombinant His6-tagged PLP-J protein generated in a prokaryotic expression system, pQE-30Xa (Qiagen). The mature rat PLP-J cDNA was used as a template for PCR amplification of a PLP-J fragment with BamHI and SacI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, using sequence specific primers, 5′-cat tta aag gat cca cac cat atg acc aga tgt-3′ and 5′-gtt ata tgt cga gct ctt acc act tgt ttt taa taa tg-3′. The amplified fragment was ligated into the pQE-30Xa plasmid and transformed into Escherichia coli, M15[pREP4]. His6-PLP-J expression was induced by 2 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, and His6-PLP-J protein was purified from bacterial exclusion bodies by Ni2+-NTA-agarose affinity chromatography, as described above. Purified His6-PLP-J was characterized by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-His tag antibodies (Qiagen). Purified His6-PLP-J was used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits as previously described (48Deb S. Hashizume K. Boone K. Southard J.N. Talamantes F. Rawitch A. Soares M.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1989; 63: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 49Deb S. Youngblood T. Rawitch A. Soares M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14348-14353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis of Decidual TissuesProtein lysates were prepared by homogenizing gestation day 8.5 rat conceptuses (decidua and extraembryonic and embryonic tissues) in radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100 or 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Protein concentrations were determined by the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Fifty μg of total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoreactive PLP-J and dPRP were detected with antibodies to anti-PLP-J (present study) and anti-dPRP (39Rasmussen C.A. Hashizume K. Orwig K.E. Xu L. Soares M.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5558-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), respectively, and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences).ImmunocytochemistryImmunocytochemical analyses were used to localize PLP-J and dPRP proteins and the distribution of endothelial cells in gestation day 8.5 implantation sites, as described (39Rasmussen C.A. Hashizume K. Orwig K.E. Xu L. Soares M.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5558-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 40Ain R. Konno T. Canham L.N. Soares M.J. Methods Mol.

Cryosections (10 μm) were prepared, fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde solution, and blocked in 10% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. The immunodetection was performed by incubating overnight at 4 °C with anti-PLP-J (present study), anti-dPRP antibodies (39Rasmussen C.A. Hashizume K. Orwig K.E. Xu L. Soares M.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5558-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), or RECA-1 antibodies, which recognize an uncharacterized rat endothelial cell-specific surface antigen (Serotec, Oxford, UK) (41Piva P. Flieger O. Rider V. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 1333-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Avidin-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was added for 30 min at room temperature and color-developed with an AEC kit (Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA). Tissues were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. Images were captured using a Leica MZFIII steromicroscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Welzlar, Germany) or a Nikon Eclipse 55i microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY), both equipped with Leica CCD cameras (Leica).In Situ HybridizationIn situ hybridization was performed to assess the distributions of PLP-J and dPRP transcripts in gestation day 8.5 rat implantation sites (40Ain R. Konno T. Canham L.N. Soares M.J. Methods Mol. Med. 2006; 121: 295-313PubMed Google Scholar, 51Ain R. Canham L.N. Soares M.J. Dev. Biol. 2003; 260: 176-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Cryosections (10-μm) were prepared and stored at -80 °C until used. Plasmids containing cDNAs for PLP-J (34Dai G. Wang D. Liu B. Kasik J.W. Müller H. White R.A. Hummel G.S. Soares M.J. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 166: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and dPRP (29Roby K.F. Deb S. Gibori G. Szpirer C. Levan G. Kwok S.C.M. Soares M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3136-3142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used as templates to synthesize sense and antisense digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). The frozen sections were air-dried and fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Prehybridization, hybridization, and detection of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin were performed as previously reported (12Wiemers D.O. Shao L.-J. Ain R. Dai G. Soares M.J. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 51Ain R. Canham L.N. Soares M.J. Dev. Biol. 2003; 260: 176-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Images were captured as described above.Northern Blot AnalysisNorthern blot analysis was performed as previously described (52Faria T.N. Deb S. Kwok S.C.M. Talamantes F. Soares M.J. Dev. Biol. 1990; 141: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from gestation day 8.5 rat decidual tissues, U1 uterine stromal cells, and rat aortic endothelial cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA (15 μg/lane) was resolved in 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and cross-linked. Blots were probed with 32P-labeled cDNAs for syndecans (Sdc1, NM_013026; Sdc2, NM_013082; Sdc3, NM_053893; Sdc4, NM_012649). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA was used to evaluate the integrity and equal loading of RNA samples. At least three different tissue samples from three different animals were analyzed with each probe for each time point.AP-PLP-J BindingTissues—An in situ AP-binding assay was performed as previously described (46Müller H. Dai G. Soares M.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 47Müller H. Soares M.J. Methods Mol. Med. 2006; 122: 331-340PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 8–10-μm tissue sections were prepared with a cryostat and mounted onto glass slides. The tissue sections were washed with a modified Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBHA; containing 20 mm HEPES, 0.5 mg/ml BSA and 0.1% NaN3) and incubated with AP, AP-PLP-J, or AP-placental lactogen-I (PL-I; also known as PRL family 3, subfamily d, member 1 (Prl3d1)) fusion protein (46Müller H. Dai G. Soares M.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) for 75 min at room temperature. For competition, tissue sections were incubated with various glycosaminoglycans and/or mFLAG-PLP-J protein for 45 min prior to incubation with AP-PLP-J. Following incubation, tissue sections were washed three times with HBHA containing 0.1% Tween 20 and fixed for 20 min with acetone-formaldehyde fixative. The fixed sections were washed and heated at 65 °C for 30 min to inactivate endogenous AP activity in the tissues. Localization of AP was determined by incubation with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate.Cells—For AP-ligand binding with cells, 5 × 104 cells were incubated with different concentrations of conditioned medium of AP or AP-PLP-J for 60 min at room temperature. Where indicated, cells were incubated with different concentrations of heparin for 30 min before incubation with AP-PLP-J. Cells were washed with HBHA containing 0.1% Tween 20 and HBSS. Cells were then heated for 30 min at 65 °C to inactivate endogenous AP activity. AP activity was determined by incubation with AP substrate (p-nitrophenyl phosphate) and measurement of absorbance at 405 nm. AP-PLP-J binding to heparan sulfate-deficient CHO-pgsD-677 cells and wild-type CHO cells was also assessed as previously described (22Wang D. Ishimura R. Walia D.S. Müller H. Dai G. Hunt J.S.
