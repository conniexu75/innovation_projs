https://openalex.org/W2032643119,"The kappa opioid agonists are analgesics that seem to be free of undesired morphine-like effects. Their dysphoric actions observed with the kappa agonist cyclazocine are thought to be mediated by an action at sigma-phencyclidine receptors. The benzomorphan kappa agonist MR 2033 is inactive at sigma-phencyclidine receptors. In male subjects, the opiate-active (-)-isomer, but not the (+)-isomer, elicited dose-dependent dysphoric and psychotomimetic effects that were antagonized by naloxone. Thus, kappa opiate receptors seem to mediate psychotomimetic effects. In view of the euphorigenic properties of mu agonists, our results imply the existence of opposed opioid systems affecting emotional and perceptual experiences."

https://openalex.org/W1968330562,"Chiral metal complexes provide unique molecular probes for DNA. Chiral reagents that ""recognize"" different local structures along the DNA strand have been designed by a process in which the asymmetry in shape and size of the complex is matched to that of the DNA helical groove. As a result, the chiral metal complexes provide very sensitive probes for local helical structure, both left- and right-handed. Direct coordination of chiral complexes to the DNA bases adds an element of sequence selectivity to the probe design. With a suitable reactive metal center, reagents that target chemically specific sites along the strand may be developed. One such chiral reagent, which cleaves left-handed DNA sites with photoactivation, has been useful in mapping this distinct conformation and examining its biological role. The conformation-specific molecular cleaver, much like a DNA-binding enzyme, recognizes and reacts at discrete sites along the DNA strand. These site-specific chiral metal complexes provide exciting new tools for probing the local variations in DNA structure and its role in the regulation of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1505476546,"The alterations in complex-type N-linked oligosaccharides that can occur when an animal cell line is transformed by two dissimilar viruses were examined by comparing the N-linked oligosaccharides of baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, metabolically radiolabeled with [2-3H]mannose, to the same class of oligosaccharides from BHK cells separately transformed by Rous sarcoma virus (RS-BHK), an RNA retrovirus, and polyoma virus (PY-BHK), a DNA papovavirus. Based on experiments that utilized serial lectin affinity chromatography, glycosidase digestions, and methylation analyses, both RS-BHK and PY-BHK cells demonstrated a significant increase in the relative amounts of tri- and tetraantennary complex-type N-linked oligosaccharides containing the branching sequence, [GlcNAc-beta(1,6)Man-alpha(1,6)Man], compared to the nontransformed BHK cells. In addition, almost all of the poly-N-acetyllactosamine sequence, [GlcNAc-beta(1,3)-Gal-beta(1,4)], was expressed on the tri- and tetraantennary N-linked oligosaccharides from BHK and RS-BHK cells that contain the sequence, [GlcNAc-beta(1,6)Man-beta(1,6)Man]. The increase in the relative amounts of this latter sequence in the transformed cells, therefore, most likely results in an increase in the amount of poly-N-acetyllactosamine sequence on the N-linked glycopeptides of these cells. The analysis of the degree of sialylation of the complex-type N-linked oligosaccharides from BHK and RS-BHK cells by ion exchange chromatography revealed no apparent differences, and in both of these cell types approximately 3% of the glycopeptide fraction radiolabeled with mannose was recovered in a highly negatively charged fraction that was identified by keratanase digestion to be keratan sulfate."
https://openalex.org/W1580903801,"We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the Escherichia coli fepA gene, which codes for the outer membrane receptor for ferrienterochelin and colicins B and D. The predicted FepA polypeptide has a molecular weight of 79,908 and consists of 723 amino acids. A 22-amino acid leader or signal peptide preceded the mature protein. With respect to overall composition, hydropathy, net charge and distribution of nonpolar segments, the FepA polypeptide was typical of other E. coli outer membrane proteins, except that FepA contained 2 cysteine residues. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of FepA with that of three other TonB-dependent receptors (BtuB, FhuA, and IutA) revealed only a few regions of sequence homology; one of these included the amino-termini. An amino acid substitution within the conserved amino-terminal region of BtuB resulted in production of a receptor that had normal binding functions but was incapable of energy-dependent transport of vitamin B12. This result suggests that the amino-terminal end of these four polypeptides is involved in interaction with the TonB protein or another step of energy transduction. Three other regions of homology were shared among the four proteins: one near residues 50 to 70, another at about residue 100 to 140, and the last between 20 and 40 amino acid residues from the carboxyl terminus. The function of these three regions remains speculative."
https://openalex.org/W1976680335,"The genetic and molecular mechanisms that determine the capacity of a virus to utilize distinct pathways of spread in an infected host were examined by using reoviruses. Both reovirus type 1 and reovirus type 3 spread to the spinal cord following inoculation into the hindlimb or forelimb footpad of newborn mice. For type 3 this spread is through nerves and occurs via the microtubule-associated system of fast axonal transport. By contrast, type 1 spreads to the spinal cord through the bloodstream. With the use of reassortant viruses containing various combinations of double-stranded RNA segments (genes) derived from type 1 and type 3, the viral S1 double-stranded RNA segment was shown to be responsible for determining the capacity of reoviruses to spread to the central nervous system through these distinct pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1530181168,"The major antigen derived from elastic fiber microfibrils was identified as a Mr = 31,000 glycoprotein, using immunoblotting and immunohistochemical techniques with antisera raised to reductive guanidine extracts of fetal bovine nuchal ligament, and to subfractions of these. A second, elastic fiber-derived, but unidentified, antigen of large molecular size (Mr greater than 200,000) was present in these extracts. Antisera raised to the purified 31-kDa were shown, by immunoelectron microscopy, to localize specifically to the elastin-associated microfibrils. Thus, the macro-molecule was called microfibril-associated glycoprotein or MAGP. MAGP is an acidic with a distinctive amino acid composition, being exceptionally rich in glutamic acid, rich in cystine, and low in glycine. MAGP was extractable from tissue homogenates using NaCl, urea, or guanidine hydrochloride solutions, only if a strong reducing agent was present. Thus, disulfide bonding is important for the strong association of MAGP with elastic fibers. Immunoblotting with anti-MAGP antiserum identified two additional reactive species, of Mr = 60,000 and Mr approximately 300,000, in tissue extracts. As only the 31-kDa species was detected in fibroblast culture medium, these additional species were probably aggregates, rather than precursors. MAGP did not react with antilysyl oxidase antiserum on immunoblots or by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. MAGP is the first macromolecule to have been established to be a constituent of elastin-associated microfibrils in both developing and mature elastic tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1505024032,"Resonance Raman spectra of ferrous and ferric cytochrome c peroxidase and Compound ES and their pH dependences were investigated in resonance with Soret band. The Fe(IV) = O stretching Raman line of Compound ES was assigned to a broad band around 767 cm-1, which was shifted to 727 cm-1 upon 18O substitution. The 18O-isotopic frequency shift was recognized for Compound ES derived in H218O, but not in H216O. This clearly indicated occurrence of an oxygen exchange between the Fe(IV) = O heme and bulk water. The Fe(IV) = O stretching Raman band was definitely more intense and of higher frequency in D2O than in H2O as in Compound II of horseradish peroxidase, but in contrast with this its frequency was unaltered between pH 4 and 11. The Fe(II)-histidine stretching Raman line was assigned on the basis of the frequency shift observed for 54Fe isotopic substitution. From the intensity analysis of this band, the pKa of the heme-linked ionization of ferrocytochrome c peroxidase was determined to be 7.3. The Raman spectrum of ferricytochrome c peroxidase strongly suggested that the heme is placed under an equilibrium between the 5- and 6-coordinate high-spin structures. At neutral pH it is biased to the 5-coordinate structure, but at the acidic side of the transition of pKa = 5.5 the 6-coordinate heme becomes dominant. F- was bound to the heme iron at pH 6, but Cl- was bound only at acidic pH. Acidification by HNO3, H2SO4, CH3COOH, HBr, or HI resulted in somewhat different populations of the 5- and 6-coordinate forms when they were compared at pH 4.3. Accordingly, it is inferred that a water molecule which is suggested to occupy the sixth coordination position of the heme iron is not coordinated to the heme iron at pH 6 but that protonation of the pKa = 5.5 residue induces an appreciable structural change, allowing the coordination of the water molecule to the heme iron."
https://openalex.org/W1500213776,"Kinetoplast DNA minicircles from Crithidia fasciculata contain a single major region of bent helix. Restriction fragments containing this bent helix have electrophoretic behavior on polyacrylamide gels which is much more anomalous than that of previously studied bent fragments. Therefore, the C. fasciculata fragments probably have a more extreme curvature. Sequencing part of a cloned minicircle revealed an unusual structure for the bent region. In a sequence of 200 bases, the bent region contains 18 runs of 4-6 As with 16 of these runs in the same strand. In some parts of this sequence the A runs are regularly spaced with a periodicity of about 10 base pairs. This spacing is nearly in phase with the twist of the DNA helix. This same sequence arrangement has been observed in other bent fragments, but the number of A runs is much greater in this C. fasciculata sequence. It is likely that there are small bends associated with each A run which, because of their periodic spacing, add up to produce substantial curvature in this molecule. In addition to having highly anomalous electrophoretic behavior, the fragment has unusual circular dichroism spectra. Its spectrum in the absence of ethanol is that of B DNA, but ethanol in the concentration range of 51-71% (w/w) induces changes to forms which are different from those of any well characterized DNA structure. The C. fasciculata bent helix is neither cleaved by S1 nuclease nor modified by bromoacetaldehyde under conditions in which other unusual DNA structures (such as cruciforms or B-Z junctions) are susceptible to attack by these reagents. Finally, a two-dimensional agarose gel analysis of a family of topoisomers of a plasmid containing the bent helix revealed no supercoil-induced relaxation."
https://openalex.org/W1575369553,"The endocytosis and recycling of the human transferrin receptor were evaluated by several experimental modalities in K562 cells perturbed with 10(-5) M monensin. The work presented is an extension of a previous study demonstrating both complete inhibition of release of internalized human transferrin and a 50% reduction in the number of cell surface transferrin binding sites in K562 cells treated with monensin (Stein, B. S., Bensch, K. G., and Sussman, H. H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 14762-14772). The data directly reveal the existence of two distinct transferrin receptor recycling pathways. One pathway is monensin-sensitive and is felt to represent recycling of transferrin receptors through the Golgi apparatus, and the other pathway is monensin-resistant and most likely represents non-Golgi-mediated transferrin receptor recycling. A transferrin-free K562 cell culture system was developed and used to demonstrate that cell surface transferrin receptors can be endocytosed without antecedent ligand binding, indicating that there are factors other than transferrin binding which regulate receptor internalization. Evidence is presented suggesting that two transferrin receptor recycling pathways are also operant in K562 cells under ligand-free conditions, signifying that trafficking of receptor into either recycling pathway is not highly ligand-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W1488325657,"The differential tissue-specific regulation of glucokinase activity in liver and pancreatic islet cells was investigated in the insulinoma-bearing rat. A transplantable insulinoma caused hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia in the host by 2-3 months after implantation. Suppression of the pancreatic B-cells by the high insulin and/or low glucose manifested itself by a decrease of insulin in islet tissue. Removal of the tumor initiated transient insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia with extremes of these changes at 24 h after tumor resection. These conditions markedly affected glucose phosphorylation in the islet cells: glucokinase activity was reduced 71% in islet samples from insulinoma-bearing rats, and the enzyme fully recovered within 24 h after tumor resection. Hexokinase activity, by contrast, was not affected by these manipulations. To evaluate the relative contributions of hypoglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in islet glucokinase adaptation, glucose was intravenously infused to insulinoma-bearing rats; glycemia in excess of 150 mg/100 ml combined with excessive hyperinsulinemia resulted in a partial recovery of islet glucokinase activity, first apparent after 9 h of glucose infusion and with doubling of the activity after 24 h after glucose loading. In contrast, liver glucokinase was increased nearly 4-fold at the time of extreme hypoglycemia and hyperinsulinemia and rapidly fell to control rates following tumor removal. Intravenous infusion of glucose for 24 h into the tumor-bearing rat (i.e. hyperglycemia combined with excessive plasma insulin) had no influence on liver glucokinase activity. Liver hexokinase was not influenced by any of these experimental manipulations. The data indicate that the activities of pancreatic islet and liver glucokinase are regulated in a differential manner. Insulin is apparently the primary determinant of liver glucokinase and glucose seems to control islet glucokinase. Biochemical mechanisms for differential organ-specific regulation of glucokinase activity seem to have evolved such that this enzyme may play a dual role in glucose homeostasis, namely to serve as insulin-dependent glucose sensor in the B-cells and as insulin-sensitive determinant of hepatic glucose use."

Three participating genes encode glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, a lipid-binding protein, and a serine protease. These three genes have now been cloned and sequenced. Their exon/intron structures are described, together with some interesting peculiarities and some regions of common sequence. It remains to be demonstrated whether the information for common participation of the genes in the program of differentiation resides in controlling elements within the regions sequenced."
https://openalex.org/W1489881960,"A method for determining the extent of methyl esterification of each of the four potential sites on the aspartate receptors involved in chemotaxis in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium is presented. In this procedure, radioactive methyl esters are incorporated into the receptors, the receptors are cleaved by trypsin and the V8 protease from Staphylococcus aureus, and the four fragments containing sites of methylation are separated by high performance liquid chromatography. Using this technique, we find that the rate of methyl esterification increases at all four sites after stimulation with the attractant aspartate, suggesting that all four sites of modification are involved in adaptation to aspartate. We also find that the rate of methyl esterification at each site is correlated with the homology between the protein sequence at that site and the consensus sequence, Glu-Glu-X-X-Ala-Thr/Ser."
https://openalex.org/W1577843618,"The gltX gene encoding the glutamyl-tRNA synthetase of Escherichia coli and adjacent regulatory regions was isolated and sequenced. The structural gene encodes a protein of 471 amino acids whose molecular weight is 53,810. The codon usage is that of genes highly expressed in E. coli. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the gltX gene was confirmed by mass spectrometry of large peptides derived from the glutamyl-tRNA synthetase. The observed peptides confirm 73% of the predicted sequence, including the NH2-terminal and the COOH-terminal segments. Sequence homology between the glutamyl-tRNA synthetase and other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases of E. coli was found in four segments. Three of them are aligned in the same order in all the synthetases where they are present, but the intersegment spacings are not constant; these ordered segments may come from a progenitor to which other domains were added. Starting from the NH2-end, the first two segments are part of a longer region of homology with the glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase, without need for gaps; its size, about 100 amino acids, is typical of a single folding domain. In the first segment, containing sequences homologous to the HIGH consensus, the homology is consistent with the following evolutionary linkage: gltX----glnS----metS----ileS and tyrS."
https://openalex.org/W1605534857,"More than 80% (approximately 29 kilobase pairs) of the adenovirus serotype 2 genome was surveyed for the presence of unusual DNA conformations. Seven recombinant DNAs containing the largest HindIII fragments of AD2 DNA were analyzed for the presence of negative supercoil-dependent S1 nuclease-sensitive sites. Four plasmids each contained a specific site of S1 nuclease sensitivity whereas the other three showed no reaction. Further investigation was focused on a plasmid containing one of the positively reacting fragments (fragment C) which contained the major late promoter at coordinate 16.4 on the genome; three serotypes (Ad2, Ad7, Ad12) were studied. Fine mapping studies revealed the S1-sensitive sites to be a small region (approximately 6 base pairs) located at the TATA box of the major late promoter in all three cases. Other determinations (supercoil relaxation, T7 gene 3 product sensitivity, bromoacetaldehyde reactivity, anomalous gel mobility, the influence of negative superhelical density on nuclease sensitivity) led to the conclusion that the B-helix deformation was not due to a previously recognized DNA conformation (left-handed Z-DNA, cruciform, bent DNA), but may be accounted for by the homopurine X homopyrimidine nature of this region."

https://openalex.org/W1608092708,"The interaction of phosphate with reduced uteroferrin has been re-examined in light of disagreements on the oxidation state of the binuclear iron cluster (Keough, D. T., Beck, J. L., de Jersey, J., and Zerner, B. (1982) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 108, 1643-1648; Antanaitis, B. C., and Aisen, P. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 751-756). Our results based on Mossbauer observations and the kinetics of spectral change and activity loss show clearly that phosphate binds to reduced uteroferrin to form a reduced uteroferrin-phosphate complex. This complex exhibits a pair of quadrupole doublets at 119 K with parameters typical of a high spin ferric and a high spin ferrous center, respectively, but distinct from those of the native reduced enzyme. The reduced phosphate complex exhibits a pH-dependent visible absorption maximum ranging from 530 to 561 nm. In air, the reduced phosphate complex converts to the oxidized phosphate complex with a first order rate constant of 4 X 10(-3) min-1, as monitored by spectral changes and loss of enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1532249353,"5'-Phosphoribosyl-5-aminoimidazole synthetase (EC 6.3.3.1), encoded by the purM gene of Escherichia coli, catalyzes the synthesis of 5'-phosphoribosyl-5-aminoimidazole from 5'-phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine. The purM gene was subcloned from the Clarke and Carbon (Clarke, L., and Carbon, J. (1976) Cell 9, 91-99) plasmid pLC1-41 and the nucleotide sequence determined. The mature protein, as deduced from the purM structural gene sequence, contains 344 amino acid residues and has a calculated Mr of 36,726. The 5' end of the purM mRNA was determined by mung bean nuclease mapping to be 44-45 nucleotides up-stream of the proposed GTG translation initiation codon. A C-G-rich region characteristic of stringently controlled promoters is located immediately in front of the proposed purM promoter region. Comparison of the upstream sequences of the purM and the coregulated purF loci revealed a highly conserved (33 of 39 base pairs are identical) sequence. The presumptive purM promoter is located in this region, thus suggesting that both purine loci share a common mechanism of regulation mediated through this sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1606360219,"The Bacillus subtilis gene (pyrB), which encodes aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase), was cloned on a HindIII restriction endonuclease fragment inserted into the pUC13 plasmid vector. B. subtilis pyrB was expressed in Escherichia coli, as judged by complementation of E. coli pyrB mutants and production of enzyme that was specifically inhibited by antibody directed against B. subtilis ATCase. The extent of expression was strongly dependent on the orientation of the inserted DNA in the vector, which suggested that transcription was initiated from vector-borne (rather than B. subtilis) promoters. The entire 1098-base pair HindIII fragment of B. subtilis DNA was sequenced by the Maxam-Gilbert method. The amino acid sequence of B. subtilis ATCase was deduced from a 305-codon open reading frame and agreed very well with analyses of the purified enzyme. Comparison of the sequence of B. subtilis ATCase with that of E. coli ATCase catalytic subunit, for which the three-dimensional structure is known, revealed many homologous residues of probable importance in catalysis and structural folding of ATCases. The significance of homology to E. coli ornithine transcarbamylases was also analyzed. The sequences of the 5' and 3' flanking regions to pyrB encode open reading frames in both cases which overlap with pyrB by eight and six codons, respectively. It is probable that these open reading frames encode other enzymes of a coordinately regulated unit. The sequence 5' to pyrB also encodes an mRNA bearing a pyrimidine-rich sequence followed by a typical sequence for a rho-independent transcription terminator. The presence of these elements and the 5' open reading frame suggest that B. subtilis pyrB, like E. coli pyrBI, is regulated by an attenuation mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1519716469,"Assimilatory nitrate reductase from Chlorella is a homotetramer which contains one of each of the prosthetic groups FAD, heme, and molybdenum per subunit. Besides the reduction of nitrate by NADH, nitrate reductase also catalyzes the partial activities NADH:cytochrome c reductase, NADH:ferricyanide reductase, and reduced methyl viologen:nitrate reductase. Incubation of native nitrate reductase with either trypsin, Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, or a natural inactivator protease from corn results in a loss of NADH:nitrate reductase and NADH:cytochrome c reductase activities but no loss of reduced methyl viologen:nitrate reductase activity. Incubation of nitrate reductase with V8 protease or corn inactivator protease resulted in two different products, each of which retained a different partial activity. Reduced methyl viologen:nitrate reductase activity was associated with a homotetrameric fragment of about 260 kDa which contained heme and molybdenum but no FAD. The molecular mass of native nitrate reductase determined under the same conditions was 375 kDa. NADH:ferricyanide reductase activity was associated with a monomeric species of approximately 30 kDa which contained FAD and the NADH-binding site. These results are consistent with a structure-function model of nitrate reductase which has the following features: FAD/NADH-binding domains exposed on the surface of the molecule, a protease-sensitive hinge region which connects the nitrate-reducing and NADH dehydrogenase moieties, and the quaternary structure maintained via association sites on the heme/molybdenum domain."

In the presence of high concentrations of GTP as a sole substrate, multiple GMP residues were polymerized onto the primers. By the addition of the second substrate CTP, excess GMP residues, other than the 1st residue, were removed prior to elongation.

https://openalex.org/W1650022899,"Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptors are partially purified from human placenta by sequential affinity chromatography with wheat germ agglutinin-agarose and agarose derivatized with an IGF-I analog. Adsorption specificity to this affinity matrix demonstrates that low coupling ratios of IGF-I analog to agarose yield preparations that are highly selective in purifying IGF-I receptor with minimal cross-contamination by the insulin receptor present in the same placental extracts. Incubation of the immobilized IGF-I receptor preparation with [gamma-32P]ATP results in a marked phosphorylation of the receptor beta subunits, which appear as a doublet of Mr = 93,000 and 95,000 upon electrophoresis on dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The 32P-labeled receptor beta subunit doublet contains predominantly phosphotyrosine and to a much lesser extent phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues. The immobilized IGF-I receptor preparation exhibits tyrosine kinase activity toward exogenous histone. The characteristics of the IGF-I receptor-associated tyrosine kinase are remarkably similar to those of the insulin receptor kinase. Thus, prior phosphorylation of the immobilized IGF-I receptor preparation with increasing concentrations of unlabeled ATP followed by washing to remove the unreacted ATP results in a progressive activation of the receptor-associated histone kinase activity. A maximal (10-fold) activation is achieved between 0.25 and 1 mM ATP. The concentration of ATP required for half-maximal (30 microM) activation of the IGF-I receptor kinase is similar to that of the insulin receptor kinase. Like the insulin receptor kinase, the elevated kinase activity of the phosphorylated IGF-I receptor is reversed following dephosphorylation of the receptor beta subunit with alkaline phosphatase. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of the IGF-I receptor beta subunit doublet is enhanced by 7-8-fold when reductant is included in the reaction medium, as is observed for the insulin receptor kinase. Significantly, the dose responses of both receptor types to reductant are identical. Both of the 32P-labeled IGF-I receptor beta subunit bands are resolved into six matching phosphopeptide fractions when the corresponding tryptic hydrolysates are resolved by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Significantly, four out of the six phosphopeptide fractions derived from the trypsinized IGF-I receptor beta subunits are chromatographically identical to those from the tryptic hydrolysates of 32P-labeled insulin receptor beta subunit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W1576485757,"Solutions of vanadate were controlled through concentration and pH adjustment to give specific compositions of mono- and oligovanadates. By monitoring the EPR spectrum of iodoacetamide spin-labeled ATPase, it is shown that decavanadate and the oligovanadate species present at neutral pH exhibit behavior typical of a substrate analogue. This is seen in terms of Ca2+ binding site affinity (microM), outward Ca2+ site orientation, and conformational effects on the enzyme normally associated with enzyme activation. In contrast, monovanadates exhibit behavior identical to that observed with Pi, with one exception: the vanadoenzyme is stable to Ca2+ in the concentration range of high affinity binding at the vanadate concentrations used here (200 microM). It is further demonstrated that Ca2+ binding in the 100 microM range directly induces enzyme devanadation of the monovanadate enzyme complex through Ca2+ binding to internal sites. Extensive array formation of dimeric ATPase units is found only with decavanadate in the absence of Ca2+, and then stoichiometric amounts are sufficient. Electron micrographs of dimeric arrays show evidence of increased penetration into the lipid bilayer, including freeze-fracture replicas which show evidence of corresponding pits in the inner leaflet of the bilayer. In turn, EPR spectra provide a means of following vanadate binding to the ATPase per se, as well as monitoring Ca2+-induced changes in the vanadoenzyme conformation, as only binding to specific sites on the enzyme affect the EPR spectrum."
https://openalex.org/W1669562322,"We present a study of the cleavage specificity of IRCM-serine protease 1 from frozen porcine pituitary neurointermediate lobes using polypeptide substrates representing different segments of human pro-opiomelanocortin. Using 125I-labeled ACTH(11-24) and a 125I-labeled model beta-lipotropin (beta-LPH) peptide, the preference of this protease for cleavage C-terminal to the pairs of basic residues Lys-Arg and Lys-Lys was clearly seen. This study was extended to larger unlabeled natural human polypeptides including ACTH(1-39), beta-LPH(1-89), and the N-terminal glycopeptide (1-76), which are known to serve as substrates for further cleavage in vivo. In these substrates IRCM-serine protease 1 cleaved C-terminal to all pairs of basic residues known to be cleaved in vivo. In addition, the enzyme cleaved between two pairs of basic amino acids found in NT(1-76) which are also known to be cleaved in vivo. Many potential tryptic-like cleavage sites were not cleaved by the enzyme. However, IRCM-serine protease 1 cleaved C-terminal to Phe-Arg in the three melanocyte-stimulating hormone sequences of pro-opiomelanocortin. In order to better understand the physiological role of IRCM-serine protease 1, differential centrifugation was used to study the subcellular distribution of the enzyme from porcine pituitary anterior lobe homogenates. We present evidence that the active enzyme form, isolated from the subcellular fractions, possesses a similar molecular architecture as the enzyme isolated from frozen tissue (Mr 38,000 catalytic domain linked via disulfide bridge(s) to another polypeptide chain(s) to form an Mr 88,000 monomeric structure). The majority of IRCM-serine protease activity is found to be associated with small vesicles (150,000 X g for 5 h) of as yet undetermined nature. In addition, a latent activity was found to be associated with a 27,000 X g (15 min) pellet containing the majority of mature secretory granules. If IRCM-serine protease 1 participates in prohormone maturation in vivo, we propose a model in which this protease is present in an enzymatically active form in small vesicles, possibly within clathrin-coated structures (prosecretory granules) which are then transformed to mature secretory granules by a process which would also inactivate most of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W200955117,"We have used a glucocorticoid receptor cDNA isolated from a mouse lymphoma cell line to characterize receptor mRNA and genomic sequences present in wild type and mutant rat hepatoma (HTC) and mouse thymoma (S49 and WEHI7) cells. Wild type rat and mouse cell lines contain two receptor mRNAs, 5 and 7 kilobase pairs (kb) in length, which differ in the length of their 3'-untranslated regions. Levels of receptor mRNA present in mutant HTC, WEHI7, and S49 cells of the r- (receptorless) phenotype are decreased compared to wild type cells. This decreased level of receptor mRNA parallels the decreased level of total immunoreactive receptor protein found in these cells. S49 nt- (nuclear transfer minus) cells contain receptor mRNA levels which parallel their hormone binding and immunoreactive receptor levels. Cells of the r- and nt- phenotype contain no detectable deletions or rearrangements of the receptor gene. We conclude that r- cells have lesions which affect the expression of receptor mRNA. Surprisingly, HTC cells of the r- phenotype differ from WEHI7 and S49 r- cells in that HTC r- cells contain a lower level of receptor DNA than does their parental wild type cell line. Although these cells may contain multiple lesions, it appears that loss of receptor genomic sequences is responsible, in part, for the phenotype of the HTC r- cells. The S49 nti (nuclear transfer increase) cells produce glucocorticoid receptors of molecular weights 40,000 and 94,000. These cells produce, in addition to the wild type 5- and 7-kb receptor mRNAs, two other receptor messages 5.5 and 3.5 kb in length. RNA blot analysis using various portions of our receptor cDNA indicates that these are 5' truncated messages and suggests that the 40-kDa nti receptor is truncated at its NH2-terminal end. These data also indicate that the hormone and DNA-binding regions of the receptor are located in the COOH-terminal half of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1492387255,"DNA topoisomerases have been shown to cleave DNA phosphodiester bond and simultaneously become linked to the DNA at the cleavage site via a phosphotyrosine linkage (Tse, Y.-C., Kirkegaard, K., and Wang, J. C. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 5560-5565). For prokaryotic DNA topoisomerases, this is observed only when denaturant or protease is added to the topoisomerase-DNA incubation mixture. Previous attempts to reform DNA phosphodiester bonds from the covalent protein-DNA complex have been unsuccessful. Using oligonucleotides as substrates, the cleavage reaction of Escherichia coli DNA topoisomerase I occurs spontaneously (Tse-Dinh, Y.-C., McCarron, B. G. H., Arentzen, R., and Chowdhry, V. (1983) Nucleic Acids Res. 11, 8691-8701). Upon reaction with oligo(dA) labeled with 32P using terminal transferase and [alpha-32P]dATP, the enzyme becomes covalently linked to the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide. This 32P label can then be transferred to the 3'-OH end of a linear or nicked duplex DNA molecule subsequently added to the reaction mixture. This phosphodiester bond rejoining reaction can occur at a recessed, blunt, or protruding 3'-end of double-stranded DNA. It requires magnesium ions. These observations suggest that the covalent protein-DNA complex is a true intermediate during topoisomerization. Implications on the structure of prokaryotic type I DNA topoisomerases as compared to their eukaryotic counterparts are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1521126501,"BSC-1 kidney epithelial cells derived from the African green monkey are known to express a Na+HCO3- symport (Jentsch, T. J., Schill, B. S., Schwartz, P., Matthes, H., Keller, S. K., and Wiederholt, M. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 15554-15560). In the present work, 4,4-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS)-sensitive 22Na+ uptake into confluent monolayers of BSC-1 is measured in the presence of ouabain (10(-4) M) and amiloride (10(-3) M) to define the interactions between Na+ and HCO3- binding and pH. Dependence of DIDS-sensitive 22Na+ fluxes on either Na+ or HCO3- can be described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics. External apparent Km for HCO3- decreases with increasing Na+ concentration (Km app (HCO3-) = 36 +/- 10, 18 +/- 5, and 9 +/- 3 mM at 20, 45, and 151 mM Na+o, respectively (pHo = 7.4)). Similarly, external apparent Km for Na+ decreases with increasing HCO3- concentration (Km app (Na+) = 73 +/- 22, 28 +/- 8, and 14 +/- 4 mM at 6, 17, and 56 mM HCO3o-, respectively (pHo = 7.4)). Vmax app remains constant within the experimental error. When data are replotted as a function of calculated NaCO3- concentration, they can be approximated by a single Michaelis-Menten equation. DIDS-sensitive uptake at constant Na+ and HCO3- displays a broad pH optimum in the range between 7.2 and 7.6. The data are compatible with the ion pair model in which the transported species, NaCO3-, binds to the transport site with Km = 15.3 +/- 4 microM. However, the data may also be fitted by either a random or ordered bireactant system. Sets of parameters necessary for these fits are given."
https://openalex.org/W1531059133,"We have isolated D-myo-inositol 1:2-cyclic phosphate 2-inositolphosphohydrolase (EC 3.1.4.36) from human placenta. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of inositol 1:2-cyclic phosphate to inositol 1-phosphate. The enzyme was purified 1300-fold to apparent homogeneity from the soluble fraction of human placenta. The enzyme requires Mn2+ or Mg2+ ions for activity, has an apparent Km for inositol 1:2-cyclic phosphate of 0.15 mM and forms 2.2 mumol of inositol 1-phosphate/min/mg protein. The enzyme does not utilize the cyclic esters of inositol polyphosphates as substrates. The molecular weight determined by gel filtration chromatography is approximately 55,000. Upon electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels in sodium dodecyl sulfate, the molecular weight was found to be 29,000 both in the presence and absence of beta-mercaptoethanol. The enzyme was inhibited by inositol 2-phosphate (IC50 = 4 microM) and to a lesser degree by inositol 1-phosphate (IC50 = 2 mM) and inositol (IC50 = 4 mM). Zn2+ is a potent inhibitor of enzyme activity (IC50 = 10 microM). Neither Li+ nor Ca2+ had any effect on enzyme activity. This enzyme may serve to generate inositol from inositol cyclic phosphate metabolites produced by the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in cells."
https://openalex.org/W1547046499,"8-Azidoadenosine was employed as a possible covalent probe of the erythrocyte nucleoside transporter. 8-Azidoadenosine was shown to enter human erythrocytes by a saturable mechanism (apparent Km for influx 80 microM) that was inhibited by nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR), a potent inhibitor of nucleoside transport, and competitively inhibit uridine influx and NBMPR binding. Irradiation with UV light of human erythrocyte membranes or a partially purified preparation of the nucleoside transporter in the presence of [3H]8-azidoadenosine and dithiothreitol (as a free radical scavenger) resulted in selective covalent incorporation into the band 4.5 region of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (Mr 66,000-45,000). Covalent labeling of band 4.5 was inhibited by adenosine, uridine, and inosine, but NBMPR had no effect. Surprisingly, D-glucose and cytochalasin B, but not L-glucose and cytochalasin E, blocked covalent attachment of the ligand. No incorporation of radioactivity into membranes from rabbit and pig erythrocytes was observed, cells which transport nucleosides rapidly, but have little or no functional glucose carrier. Limited treatment with trypsin of unsealed human erythrocyte membranes photolabeled with [3H]8-azidoadenosine yielded a single radioactive fragment of Mr 19,000, a pattern identical to that obtained with [3H]cytochalasin B-labeled membranes. These results suggest that, despite 8-azidoadenosine being a permeant for the nucleoside transporter, under photoactivation 8-azidoadenosine preferentially labeled the glucose carrier."
https://openalex.org/W1527247004,"Inhibition of xanthine oxidase by folic acid was reexamined after complete removal of the contaminant which was responsible for time-dependent inactivation (Lewis, A. S., Murphy, L., Mcalla, C., Fleary, M., and Purcell, S. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12-15; Spector, T., and Ferone, R. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 10784-10786). From turnover experiments using stopped flow equipment with a limited amount of xanthine and excess oxygen, and from kinetic analyses with an oxygen electrode, folic acid was found to be an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. The inhibition was competitive with xanthine with a Ki value of 4.2 X 10(-5) M. From the behavior of the enzyme in affinity chromatography using a Sepharose 4B/folate column, folic acid was also confirmed to be a competitive inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. When enzyme which had been pretreated with oxipurinol was applied to the affinity column, two fractions of xanthine oxidase were separated. The first fraction was found to contain the fully active form (double-active dimers) from the analyses of spectral changes on addition of xanthine, oxipurinol titration, and ESR slow signal, whereas the second fraction was assumed to contain mixed dimers and double-inactive dimers. The ratio of the content of the first fraction to that of the second fraction supports the hypothesis that there are three enzyme species and that there is no interaction either in catalytic activity or in sulfuration or desulfuration reactions between the two subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1499866917,"The Escherichia coli galactose and lactose promoter regions have been studied by alkylation interference experiments. The data reveal those bases or phosphate groups which, when modified, prevent the binding of the catabolite activator protein (CAP) or RNA polymerase and hence are presumably in contact with the proteins. Interference contacts made by CAP at its primary binding sites at gal and lac are quite similar, indicating that CAP-cAMP uses the same mode of binding at these two operons. RNA polymerase, when bound in the presence of CAP-cAMP, exhibits contacts at the gal and lac P1-10 regions very much like those of the lac UV5 and T7 A3 promoters (Siebenlist, U., Simpson, R. B., and Gilbert, W. (1980) Cell 20, 269-281). CAP, therefore, does not detectably alter the structure of the open complex. The binding sites for CAP and RNA polymerase at lac, as deduced from interference experiments, do not overlap. However, at gal a CAP molecule is found much closer to the enzyme, and there is competition for a set of mutual contacts. These experiments thus reveal both similarities and differences in the mechanisms whereby CAP activates transcription at catabolite-sensitive operons."
https://openalex.org/W1533361646,"We have purified two cAMP-binding proteins from developing Dictyostelium discoideum cells, which we designate as CABP-1 and CABP-2. Purified CABP-1 consists of two polypeptides of Mr 41,000 and 36,000, which we refer to as CABP-1A and CABP-1B, respectively. Although CABP-1 exhibited specificity for cAMP, it was not labeled at a detectable level when mixed with 8-azidoadenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (8-N3[3H]cAMP). Unlike CABP-1, CABP-2 was labeled efficiently with 8-N3[3H]cAMP. Purified CABP-2 has a molecular weight of 41,000 and an isoelectric point of 5.8-6.0. The physical and biochemical properties of CABP-2 suggest that it is the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase described by others (de Gunzburg, J., Part, D., Guiso, N., and Veron, M. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 3805-3812; Majerfeld, J. H., Leichtling, B. H., Maligeni, J. A., Spitz, E., and Rickenberg, H. V. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 654-661). Although CABP-1A and CABP-2 have the same molecular weight, they appear to be encoded by different genes. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that the two polypeptides had different isoelectric points. Moreover, monoclonal antibodies raised against CABP-1 did not cross-react with CABP-2. Also, in vitro translation followed by immunoprecipitation showed that these two polypeptides were derived from primary translation products. Our finding of a novel cAMP-binding protein, CABP-1, suggests that cAMP-dependent protein kinase may not be the only intracellular regulator mediating the effects of cAMP in developing D. discoideum cells."
https://openalex.org/W1551116006,"Platelet-activating factor 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAF-acether) triggers exposure of fibrinogen binding sites on platelets via binding to specific receptors. Comparison of [3H]PAF-acether binding with 125I-fibrinogen binding shows that the rate with which PAF-acether binds to a number of receptors and not the degree of receptor occupancy determines how much fibrinogen binds. At low concentrations of PAF-acether (0.1-1.0 nM) binding site exposure is incomplete and parallels the rate of formation of the PAF-acether-receptor complex. Fibrinogen binding then primarily depends on the concentration of PAF-acether. At a high concentration of PAF-acether (500 nM) binding site exposure is complete within 2-5 min. Fibrinogen binding then depends on the concentration of fibrinogen. Exposure of binding sites in the absence of fibrinogen leads to disappearance of accessible binding sites. At 500 nM PAF-acether, this disappearance is exponential in nature and shows the same characteristics after 5-15 min incubation with fibrinogen as after 60 min. Exposure of binding sites is then complete within 5 min and their disappearance is not disturbed by other processes. At 0.5 nM PAF-acether, the same characteristics are found after 60 min incubation with fibrinogen, but shorter incubation times reveal an ongoing binding site exposure that interferes with the disappearance process. These results demonstrate close coupling between the PAF-acether receptors and fibrinogen binding sites and indicate that the rate of formation of the PAF-acether-receptor complex is a major factor in the regulation of binding site exposure."
https://openalex.org/W1540998951,"The mechanism of a trans-acting mutation, dgkR1, which causes a 7-fold elevation of diacylglycerol kinase activity in membranes (Raetz, C. R. H., Kantor, G. D., Nishijima, M., and Jones, M. L. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 2109-2112) was investigated by direct measurement of diacylglycerol kinase polypeptide by high performance liquid chromatography and by construction of fusions of the dgkA promoter to beta-galactosidase and galactokinase. The dgkR1 mutation was demonstrated to act by increasing the transcription of the structural gene for diacylglycerol kinase, dgkA. Additionally, sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activities were shown to be decreased 30-50% in membranes from dgkR1 mutant strains. Increased diacylglycerol levels occurred when cells were grown on low osmolarity media. This did not affect dgkA expression. In a dgkR+ background, enhanced expression of sn-1,2-diacylglycerol kinase activity in cells containing a high copy number plasmid bearing dgkA decreased sn-1,2-diacylglycerol levels. However, overproduction of diacylglycerol kinase in a dgkR1 genetic background did not affect diacylglycerol levels, suggesting that the dgkR1 mutation affects diacylglycerol metabolism by mechanisms additional to enhancement of dgkA transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1561417280,"We have determined the distribution of the nucleosomal bound nonhistone chromosomal protein, H2A-specific protease, in calf thymus and liver chromatin. The protease was unevenly distributed in chromatin with domains containing histone H1 being selectively complexed with the enzyme. Moreover, the protease had a preference for the less compact chromatin domains enriched in the H1 subtypes H1a and -c. We have demonstrated that ubiquitinated H2A is a substrate of the H2A-specific protease and that the enzyme is a serine protease which can be inactivated with protease inhibitors only after it is released from the nucleosome. Possible functions of the protease in modulating chromatin structure are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1570680156,"Phosphoglycolate phosphatases from spinach and human red blood cells show a number of common features not often found in enzymes. Both enzymes are activated more than 50-fold by millimolar concentrations of Cl-. Other inorganic anions and a number of carboxylic acids also activate. Each enzyme has limited substrate specificity yet each hydrolyzes P-glycolate and ethyl-P with the same maximal velocity. L-P-lactate is only a good substrate for the red cell enzyme. With both enzymes initial rate data obtained by varying both the P-glycolate and Cl- give parallel line double reciprocal plots. Similar experiments with ethyl-P as substrate give intersecting lines with both enzymes. The likelihood that both classes of substrates are acting at the same site is strengthened by the results of inhibition studies with alternative substrates and the constancy of inhibition constants for glycolate with all substrates for a given enzyme. For each substrate the experimentally observed variation in V/Km with different activators is small, suggesting that the enzyme has an ordered mechanism with the phosphorylated substrate reacting first. A mechanism that is consistent with all of the data is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1497203493,"We have examined the chromatin structure around the +1 transcriptional start site of the mouse alpha 2(I) collagen gene by studying the accessibility of DNA to several restriction enzymes as well as to DNase I. In NIH 3T3 cells, which express high levels of alpha 2(I) collagen mRNA, we detect a DNase I-hypersensitive site from -240 to +110 relative to the start site of transcription at +1. By digesting chromatin with restriction enzymes, which cleave naked DNA at multiple sites within the -2000 to +1000 region, a considerably more complex picture was revealed. DNA sequences upstream of around -550 and downstream of +150 are much less accessible to restriction enzymes than the region between these sites and are, therefore, probably packaged in a more compact conformation. The region from around -550 to -240 although not within the DNase I-hypersensitive domain is nevertheless accessible to restriction enzymes and, therefore, presumably in a relatively open conformation. In addition, beginning 5' to -100 there is a gradual decrease in restriction enzyme accessibility as one approaches +150. Of particular interest is the finding that although sites at +65 and +126 are relatively accessible, a HinfI site at +113 is resistant in chromatin. In v-mos transformed NIH 3T3 cells which express alpha 2(I) collagen at much lower levels than untransformed NIH 3T3 cells, the DNase I-hypersensitive site as well as the majority of the chromatin restriction enzyme accessibility patterns are similar to those found in untransformed NIH 3T3 cells. However, a SphI site at +58 appears less accessible in the transformed cells. We also examined the chromatin of a myeloma cell line which does not synthesize alpha 2(I) collagen at detectable levels. In the nuclei of these cells the DNA of the alpha 2(I) collagen promoter is inaccessible to DNase I and to all restriction enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1507718478,"A polyclonal antibody to the catalytic subunit of rat kidney Na,K-ATPase has been raised in rabbits and used to analyze the turnover of the subunit in the rat hepatoma cell line HTC. It had been shown previously (Baumann, H., and Doyle, D. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 4408-4418) that the membrane proteins of these cells displayed multicomponent turnover kinetics, the minority of the surface proteins turning over with a half-time of about 20 h and the remainder with a half-time of about 100 h. That the antibody precipitated both the alpha (catalytic) and beta (glycosylated) subunits of the Na,K-ATPase from Triton extracts of HTC cells could be demonstrated following metabolic labeling of the cells with either [3H]leucine or a mixture of [3H] mannose and [3H]fucose, but following labeling with [35S]methionine radioactivity was found only in the alpha subunit of the precipitates. Incorporation of [35S]methionine into the alpha subunit could be detected 2 min after addition of the isotope to the cell suspension. Then and at all times thereafter the label was recoverable only from the particulate fraction of a 150,000 X g 60-min centrifugation; no labeled alpha subunit was ever detected in the supernatant fraction. By quantitative densitometry of radioautographs of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels of labeled antibody precipitates, it could be shown in pulse-chase experiments that the specific activity of the alpha subunit remained unchanged for 3-4 h (transit time) after the pulse was initiated and that the activity subsequently decayed exponentially with a half-time of 18 h. In a population growing with a generation time (tG) of 33 h, this decay corresponds to a turnover rate constant of 0.49/tG. The catalytic subunit is among those membrane proteins with a rapid turnover rate."
https://openalex.org/W1591882304,"In the absence of cAMP the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) is relatively resistant to trypsin whereas the cAMP X CRP complex is attacked yielding N-terminal core fragments of 14,300 and 18,500 Da which still bind cAMP. The DNA X CRP complex formed at low ionic strength in the absence of cAMP is cleaved by trypsin with the formation of 9,700- and 6,000-Da fragments and the concomitant loss of cAMP binding activity. DNA X CRP remains as resistant to attack by subtilisin, clostripain, and the Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease as unliganded CRP but is slowly digested by chymotrypsin. All of the double-stranded polydeoxyribonucleotides and several of the single-stranded polydeoxyribonucleotides and polyribonucleotides tested render CRP sensitive to cleavage by trypsin. CRP is less rapidly cleaved by trypsin in the presence of d(A)n, d(I)n, and r(C)n indicative of a weaker affinity of CRP for these polynucleotides. The 9,700-Da fragment is N-terminal in CRP and probably terminates at Lys-89. The loss of cAMP binding activity following trypsin cleavage of DNA X CRP indicates that regions beyond this residue are important in the function of the cAMP-binding domain of CRP. The 6,000-Da fragment extends from Val-131 to Arg-185 or Lys-188 and contains part of the F helix involved in DNA binding by CRP."

Chem. 261, 2697-2711), using a three-fragment complex (1-25)H X (28-38) X (39-104) of horse cytochrome c, have shown that invariant leucine 32 and partially invariant leucine 35, both buried in the interior, exhibit a striking difference in perturbation of binding fragment (28-38) by substitution with isoleucine. Then the idea has been proposed that the energy states of leucine 32, the Met-80-S-heme-Fe bond and other distant residues such as tryptophan 59 would be coupled to generate extra force while leucine 35 would be less important for such coupling if it were involved. In the present studies we synthesized three (28-38) analogs substituting invariant proline 30 with glycine or invariant glycine 34 with alanine or serine. Thermodynamic and kinetic studies and UV CD and biological activity measurements were carried out on binding of the analogs to complex (1-25)H X (39-104). The results with the ferric form show that perturbations of delta G, delta H, and delta S associated with formation of the intermediate complex and with the ensuing process by the Gly34----Ala or Ser substitution result in weakening the Met-80-S-heme-Fe bond formed in the latter process; in contrast, perturbation by the Pro30----Gly substitution is small. However, the biological activity is more perturbed by the Pro30----Gly substitution than by the Gly34----Ala or Ser; and in the Gly34----Ala or Ser substitution the complex appears to be more readily activated for both formation and disruption of the Met-80-S-heme-Fe bond at 20 degrees C and below than without substitution. In all cases reduction of the heme strengthens the binding of fragment (28-38). However, striking are the increases in perturbation (less negative) of both delta H and delta S for binding of fragment (28-38) to form the ground state on reduction of the heme in the Pro30----Gly, Gly34----Ala or Ser (the present studies), and Leu32----norvaline (the previous studies) substitutions. It is known that fluctuation of the atomic positions of most residues of tuna ferrocytochrome c including Pro30, Leu32, and Gly34 increases on oxidation of the heme and that these three residues are among those showing the least fluctuating atomic positions (Takano, T., and Dickerson, R.E.

https://openalex.org/W1503458744,"The effects of ethanol on the gastric H+,K+-ATPase activity and the degree of mobility of various microsomal phospholipids were assessed using 31P and 1H NMR. This illuminated the role of lipid-protein association in the function of pig gastric microsomes. Treatment of gastric microsomes with 15% ethanol for 1 min at 37 degrees C inactivated the H+,K+-ATPase activity, which could largely be reconstituted by supplementation with phosphatidylcholine isolated from the gastric microsomes. Under similar conditions, the 1H NMR profile of the microsomal +N(CH3)3 choline moiety showed dramatic enhancement of peak intensity as well as a break point at 25 degrees C which was restored to the untreated control value after reconstitution. This break, together with the dramatic enhancement in the overall lipid profile, compared to the control and reconstituted microsomes, suggested a greater degree of freedom of movement of the microsomal lipids following ethanol perturbation. The data demonstrate the unique ability that a combined approach using 31P and 1H NMR holds as a noninvasive probe to study the structure-function relationship of biomembranes."
https://openalex.org/W1556334399,"In the course of studies on genes for small nuclear RNAs, seven lambda phage clones containing sequences homologous to 5 S RNA were plaque purified from a rat genomic library. The seven clones were found to be from six different genomic loci. When the 5 S RNA hybridized to these clones was digested by T1 RNase, only clone 5S-2 protected the RNA completely. Moreover, clone 5S-2 which has five nucleotide substitutions in the internal control region was transcribed 10 times more efficiently than a bonafide Chinese hamster 5S gene. The other clones were less efficiently transcribed than a bonafide 5S gene or not transcribed at all. The number of gene variants for 5 S RNA in the rat genome was approximately 3000. In contrast to the clustering of 5S genes and gene variants found in Xenopus, Drosophila, hamster, mouse, and human cells, the 5S gene variants in the rat genome are dispersed and most contained conserved 3'-flanking sequences. These naturally occurring 5S gene variants may be useful in binding transcription factors that affect 5S genes."

This enzyme(s) has been designated as a nuclease(s). This nuclease does not require divalent cations for activity, and therefore it is not the Ca2+-Mg2+-DNase found in mammalian cells. The linker-specific nuclease activity is not detectable in the dry aleurone tissue and in the tissue treated with 0.5 mM cordycepin. The endonuclease activity of the aleurone tissue incubated with gibberellic acid is higher than the level of this endonuclease in tissue treated with abscisic acid or water alone. Nuclei isolated from embryos have lower levels of endonuclease activities compared to those from aleurone tissue. Digestion of the nuclei from embryos with micrococcal nuclease revealed the subunit structure of chromatin. In Southern blots of the HindIII digests of DNA from embryos, five DNA bands hybridized to a nick-translated alpha-amylase cDNA clone. In similar autoradiograms with aleurone DNA, particular bands are less visible, notably in the DNA isolated from the tissue treated with gibberellic acid.

https://openalex.org/W1585057189,"Estradiol (E2) induces a complementary increase in both the amount of mRNA and the rate of translation of the mRNA in the uterus of ovariectomized mature rats. The mechanism of the translational effect was evaluated by measuring the functional capacity of uterine tRNA isolated from control, E2 (1 h)- and E2 (14 h)-treated ovariectomized rats to support amino acid acceptor activity and uterine protein synthesis. The specific amino acid acceptor activity (SAA) of deacylated tRNA for 18 individual amino acids was determined using a tRNA-dependent rat liver tRNA synthetase preparation. The SAA was the same for all amino acids for uterine tRNA from control and E2 (1 h)-treated rats but was increased for uterine tRNA from E2 (14 h)-treated rats to levels that were 1.4-4.3 times the SAA of uterine tRNA from control rats. When uterine tRNA from control and E2 (14 h)-treated rats was incubated with purified tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, the SAA for all amino acids was increased an average of 1.6-fold for control tRNA and 0.3-fold for tRNA from E2 (14 h)-treated rats. The ability of uterine tRNA to support maximal rates of protein synthesis in tRNA-dependent uterine ribosome protein synthesis assay was increased by either in vivo treatment of the rats with estradiol or by in vitro repair of the 3'-CCA terminus of this tRNA by nucleotidyltransferase. These observations suggest that E2 may increase the rate of mRNA translation in the uterus, in part, by increasing the proportion of certain tRNAs with intact and functional 3'-CCA acceptor termini."

Purification steps include fractionation with protamine sulfate and ammonium sulfate followed by column chromatography on Bio-Gel and DEAE-cellulose; synthetase purified over 300-fold is obtained. The enzyme has a molecular weight estimated to be approximately 250,000 and a broad pH optimum with maximal activity at approximately pH 7.5. Maximal rates of activity are obtained with NH+4 (Km = 3.7 mM) as the amide donor and the enzyme is highly specific for 4-methylene-L-glutamic acid (Km = 2.7 mM) as the amide acceptor. Product identification and stoichiometric studies establish the reaction catalyzed to be: 4-methyleneglutamic acid + NH4+ + ATP Mg2+----4-methyleneglutamine + AMP + PPi. PPi accumulates only when F- is added to inhibit pyrophosphatase activity present in synthetase preparations. This enzymatic activity is completely insensitive to the glutamine synthetase inhibitors, tabtoxinine-beta-lactam and F-, and is only partially inhibited by methionine sulfoximine. It is, however, inhibited by added pyrophosphate in the presence of F- as well as by certain divalent metal ions (other than Mg2+) including Hg2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+.
