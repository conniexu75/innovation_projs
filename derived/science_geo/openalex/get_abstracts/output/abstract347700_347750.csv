https://openalex.org/W2138977668,"Successful reprogramming of differentiated human somatic cells into a pluripotent state would allow creation of patient- and disease-specific stem cells. We previously reported generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, capable of germline transmission, from mouse somatic cells by transduction of four defined transcription factors. Here, we demonstrate the generation of iPS cells from adult human dermal fibroblasts with the same four factors: Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. Human iPS cells were similar to human embryonic stem (ES) cells in morphology, proliferation, surface antigens, gene expression, epigenetic status of pluripotent cell-specific genes, and telomerase activity. Furthermore, these cells could differentiate into cell types of the three germ layers in vitro and in teratomas. These findings demonstrate that iPS cells can be generated from adult human fibroblasts."

https://openalex.org/W2138319435,"Compact solid-state sources of terahertz (THz) radiation are being sought for sensing, imaging, and spectroscopy applications across the physical and biological sciences. We demonstrate that coherent continuous-wave THz radiation of sizable power can be extracted from intrinsic Josephson junctions in the layered high-temperature superconductor Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 . In analogy to a laser cavity, the excitation of an electromagnetic cavity resonance inside the sample generates a macroscopic coherent state in which a large number of junctions are synchronized to oscillate in phase. The emission power is found to increase as the square of the number of junctions reaching values of 0.5 microwatt at frequencies up to 0.85 THz, and persists up to ∼50 kelvin. These results should stimulate the development of superconducting compact sources of THz radiation."
https://openalex.org/W1967269362,"Changes in phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAP) are associated with transcription initiation, elongation and termination. Sites of active transcription are generally characterized by hyperphosphorylated RNAP, particularly at Ser 2 residues, whereas inactive or poised genes may lack RNAP or may bind Ser 5-phosphorylated RNAP at promoter proximal regions. Recent studies have demonstrated that silent developmental regulator genes have an unusual histone modification profile in ES cells, being simultaneously marked with Polycomb repressor-mediated histone H3K27 methylation, and marks normally associated with gene activity. Contrary to the prevailing view, we show here that this important subset of developmental regulator genes, termed bivalent genes, assemble RNAP complexes phosphorylated on Ser 5 and are transcribed at low levels. We provide evidence that this poised RNAP configuration is enforced by Polycomb Repressor Complex (PRC)-mediated ubiquitination of H2A, as conditional deletion of Ring1A and Ring1B leads to the sequential loss of ubiquitination of H2A, release of poised RNAP, and subsequent gene de-repression. These observations provide an insight into the molecular mechanisms that allow ES cells to self-renew and yet retain the ability to generate multiple lineage outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W2005420538,"Whether social comparison affects individual well-being is of central importance for understanding behavior in any social environment. Traditional economic theories focus on the role of absolute rewards, whereas behavioral evidence suggests that social comparisons influence well-being and decisions. We investigated the impact of social comparisons on reward-related brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). While being scanned in two adjacent MRI scanners, pairs of subjects had to simultaneously perform a simple estimation task that entailed monetary rewards for correct answers. We show that a variation in the comparison subject's payment affects blood oxygenation level–dependent responses in the ventral striatum. Our results provide neurophysiological evidence for the importance of social comparison on reward processing in the human brain."
https://openalex.org/W2031172417,"Paraquat (1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium dichloride) is widely used as a redox cycler to stimulate superoxide production in organisms, cells, and mitochondria. This superoxide production causes extensive mitochondrial oxidative damage, however, there is considerable uncertainty over the mitochondrial sites of paraquat reduction and superoxide formation. Here we show that in yeast and mammalian mitochondria, superoxide production by paraquat occurs in the mitochondrial matrix, as inferred from manganese superoxide dismutase-sensitive mitochondrial DNA damage, as well as from superoxide assays in isolated mitochondria, which were unaffected by exogenous superoxide dismutase. This paraquat-induced superoxide production in the mitochondrial matrix required a membrane potential that was essential for paraquat uptake into mitochondria. This uptake was of the paraquat dication, not the radical monocation, and was carrier-mediated. Experiments with disrupted mitochondria showed that once in the matrix paraquat was principally reduced by complex I (mammals) or by NADPH dehydrogenases (yeast) to form the paraquat radical cation that then reacted with oxygen to form superoxide. Together this membrane potential-dependent uptake across the mitochondrial inner membrane and the subsequent rapid reduction to the paraquat radical cation explain the toxicity of paraquat to mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W1993537846,"Plants use light to optimize growth and development. The photoreceptor phytochrome A (phyA) mediates various far-red light–induced responses. We show that Arabidopsis FHY3 and FAR1 , which encode two proteins related to Mutator -like transposases, act together to modulate phyA signaling by directly activating the transcription of FHY1 and FHL , whose products are essential for light-induced phyA nuclear accumulation and subsequent light responses. FHY3 and FAR1 have separable DNA binding and transcriptional activation domains that are highly conserved in Mutator -like transposases. Further, expression of FHY3 and FAR1 is negatively regulated by phyA signaling. We propose that FHY3 and FAR1 represent transcription factors that have been co-opted from an ancient Mutator -like transposase(s) to modulate phyA-signaling homeostasis in higher plants."

https://openalex.org/W2069993714,"The proprotein convertase PCSK9 gene is the third locus implicated in familial hypercholesterolemia, emphasizing its role in cardiovascular diseases. Loss of function mutations and gene disruption of PCSK9 resulted in a higher clearance of plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol, likely due to a reduced degradation of the liver low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). In this study, we show that two of the closest family members to LDLR are also PCSK9 targets. These include the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) implicated in neuronal development and lipid metabolism. Our results show that wild type PCSK9 and more so its natural gain of function mutant D374Y can efficiently degrade the LDLR, VLDLR, and ApoER2 either following cellular co-expression or re-internalization of secreted human PCSK9. Such PCSK9-induced degradation does not require its catalytic activity. Membrane-bound PCSK9 chimeras enhanced the intracellular targeting of PCSK9 to late endosomes/lysosomes and resulted in a much more efficient degradation of the three receptors. We also demonstrate that the activity of PCSK9 and its binding affinity on VLDLR and ApoER2 does not depend on the presence of LDLR. Finally, in situ hybridization show close localization of PCSK9 mRNA expression to that of VLDLR in mouse postnatal day 1 cerebellum. Thus, this study demonstrates a more general effect of PCSK9 on the degradation of the LDLR family that emphasizes its major role in cholesterol and lipid homeostasis as well as brain development.

One of the unanswered questions is the target specificity of PCSK9, and it is not known, nor obvious, whether other members of the LDLR family are also affected by PCSK9. This family consists of structurally closely related transmembrane proteins: LRP1, LRP1b, megalin/LRP2, LDLR, very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), MEGF7/LRP4, LRP8/apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (apoER2) (22Howell B.W.

However, because primary sequence alignment revealed that the closest structural members to LDLR are VLDLR (59% identity) and ApoER2 (46% identity) (supplemental Fig. S1), we tested the potential degradation activity of PCSK9 on these two receptors. Our data demonstrate that wild type PCSK9, and more so its natural mutant D374Y, enhance the degradation of VLDLR and ApoER2 in an LDLR- and catalytic activity-independent manner. Furthermore, the expression of either ApoER2 or VLDLR in CHO-A7 cells lacking endogenous LDLR enhanced the cellular association of exogenous PCSK9. Finally, we show that intracellular targeting of membrane-bound PCSK9 chimera accentuates their activity on the three receptors. Sequence Alignment—As shown in Fig. S1, the full-length sequence of ApoER2 (NP_150643), VLDLR (NP_003374), and LDLR (NP_000518) were aligned using the Multalin (23Corpet F.

Because the primary sequences of ApoER2 and VLDLR exhibit the highest identity and similarity to that of LDLR (46 and 49 and 59 and 65%; supplemental Fig. S1), it was of interest to assess whether PCSK9 may also enhance the degradation of these receptors. To test this hypothesis, HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected with cDNAs encoding ApoER2, VLDLR, and LDLR either with an empty vector (pIRES; Ctl) or wild type PCSK9 (Fig. 1A). Twenty-four hours later, we analyzed by Western blot the steady state levels of each receptor in total cell lysates. Clearly, as for the LDLR, the presence of PCSK9 resulted in a substantial decrease in the protein levels of both ApoER2 and VLDLR. As control, PCSK9 did not affect the amount of a transmembrane protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) suggesting that the three receptors may share a common specific motif that is not present in ACE-2. We then extended our observations by co-transfecting NIH 3T3 fibroblasts with VLDLR or ApoER2 either with an empty vector (Ctl) or with recombinant PCSK9. The data revealed that as in HEK293 cells, PCSK9 enhances the degradation of both ApoER2 and VLDLR, the levels of which were normalized by an internal protein standard, namely lissencephaly (Lis1, Fig. 1B) (32Reiner O. Cahana A. Escamez T. Martinez S. Mol. Psychiatry. 2002; 7: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that PCSK9 enhances the degradation of LDLR both intracellularly (12Park S.W. Moon Y.A. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50630-50638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 33Seidah N.G. Prat A. J. Mol.

Accordingly, we tested whether addition of PCSK9 extracellularly to cells expressing VLDLR or ApoER2 had the same effect as that reported for LDLR. As the endogenous expression of these receptors is usually low in most cell lines, we opted to use mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts stably expressing either receptor, as well as their cytosolic adaptor protein Dab1 (24Mayer H. Duit S. Hauser C. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We incubated overnight the respective stable cell lines with conditioned media of HEK293 cells expressing either an empty vector (-) or wild type PCSK9 (+). Again, the results show that exogenous PCSK9 induces the intracellular degradation of VLDLR and ApoER2 (Fig. 1C). Thus, similar to its effect on LDLR (3Benjannet S. Rhainds D. Essalmani R. Mayne J.

Catalytic Activity of PCSK9 Is Not Required for LDLR, ApoER2, and VLDLR Degradation—Like other proprotein convertases (PCs), PCSK9 is synthesized as an inactive zymogen (proPCSK9) in the endoplasmic reticulum (2Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Wickham L. Marcinkiewicz J. Jasmin S.B. Stifani S. Basak A. Prat A. Chretien M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Using its catalytic triad (Asp186, His226, and Ser386), proPCSK9 undergoes an intramolecular autocatalytic cleavage resulting in a heterodimeric complex of its prosegment (proPC9; amino acids 31-152) and the rest of the molecule (Δpro-PC9; amino acids 153-692), which then traffics through the secretory pathway (2Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Wickham L. Marcinkiewicz J. Jasmin S.B. Stifani S. Basak A. Prat A. Chretien M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that HepG2 cells incubated with an active site mutant of PCSK9 obtained via co-expression of the prosegment together with a PCSK9 construct lacking the prosegment (either wild type of the D374Y mutant) resulted in a fully active heterodimer than can reduce the steady state levels of LDLR, independent from its catalytic activity (21McNutt M.C. Lagace T.A. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20799-20803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). We thus examined whether the activity of PCSK9 was necessary for the degradation of ApoER2 and VLDLR. Using HEK293 cells, we first showed that similar levels of secreted PCSK9 were found in the media of cells expressing either in trans wild type PCSK9 (proPC9 + ΔproPC9-wt; t-PCSK9-wt) and full-length PCSK9 (PCSK9-wt; Fig. 2A, bottom). Upon co-expression with ApoER2, VLDLR, or LDLR, both PCSK9 constructs are able to degrade the three receptors (Fig. 2A). Because the high binding affinity of the D374Y mutant seems to be independent of its catalytic activity (21McNutt M.C. Lagace T.A. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20799-20803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), we co-expressed in trans an inactive site mutant version of the D374Y (t-PCSK9-H226A/D374Y, Fig. 2A). Clearly, the co-expression of t-PCSK9-H226A/D374Y with ApoER2, VLDLR, or LDLR in HEK293 cells showed similar enhanced degradation activity as compared with the trans-expression of the catalytically active D374Y (t-PCSK9-D374Y) and the full-length form (PCSK9-D374Y; Fig. 2A). Thus, our data suggest that as for the LDLR, the catalytic activity of PCSK9 is not required for the degradation of either ApoER2 or VLDLR. Using HuH7 cells, we then decided to study the subcellular localization of trans-expressed wild type PCSK9 (t-PCSK9-wt, Fig. 2). We first expressed in HuH7 cells the full-length PCSK9-wt and its natural mutant PCSK9-D374Y. Our confocal microscopy analyses show that both constructs (PCSK9-wt, PCSK9-D374Y; Fig. 2B, red) are present in the late-endosomes/lysosomes compartment based on their co-localization with the CI-MPR marker (Fig. 2B, blue). We then expressed in trans V5-proPC9 with ΔproPC9-wt and show that both molecules co-localized in specific compartments within the cells in a similar fashion to PCSK9 (V5 and PCSK9 immunoreactivity), likely representing late-endosomes/lysosomes. In fact, our data suggest that as compared with the full-length PCSK9, trans-expression (proPC9 +ΔproPC9-wt) resulted in a similar subcellular localization and degradation function on the three receptors, in a PCSK9 catalytic activity-independent fashion. PCSK9 Enhances the Degradation of ApoER2 and VLDLR in an LDLR-independent Fashion—To test whether the presence of LDLR is necessary for the observed PCSK9 activity on ApoER2 or VLDLR, we made use of ldlA7 cells that lack expression of endogenous LDLR (herein called CHO-A7 cells) (25Krieger M. Cell. 1983; 33: 413-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The cDNAs of each receptor were co-expressed with that of a control empty pIRES vector (Ctl), PCSK9, or its D374Y mutant. Western blot analyses (Fig. 3A) revealed that PCSK9 and its D374Y mutant are similarly active in the absence of LDLR. This implies that the overexpressed PCSK9-induced degradation of ApoER2 and VLDLR is independent of the presence of LDLR. To study the binding affinity of PCSK9 on either ApoER2 or VLDLR and to define whether if the effect of exogenous PCSK9 on these receptors is also independent of LDLR, we generated CHO-A7 pools that stably express an empty vector (DNA3-A7), ApoER2 (ApoER2-A7), or VLDLR (VLDLR-A7). We then incubated overnight these cells with media obtained from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with empty vector (Ctl), PCSK9, or its D374Y mutant (Fig. 3B). Following extensive washes with phosphate-buffered saline, Western blot analyses of duplicate cell lysates revealed that the presence of ApoER2 (Fig. 3C) or VLDLR (Fig. 3D) clearly enhanced the ability of exogenous PCSK9, and more so its D374Y mutant, to be associated with CHO-A7 cells. Whereas under these conditions extracellular PCSK9-wt has no effect on either receptor, exogenous PCSK9-D374Y is able to partially reduce the levels of ApoER2 and more so VLDLR, even though similar amounts were associated with both cells. Because the degradation of ApoER2 and VLDLR by co-expressed PCSK9 is LDLR-independent, we"

Structural study shows that these phases are produced by the end-to-end adhesion and consequent stacking of the duplex oligomers into polydisperse anisotropic rod-shaped aggregates, which can order into liquid crystals. Upon cooling mixed solutions of short DNA oligomers, in which only a small fraction of the DNA present is complementary, the duplex-forming oligomers phase-separate into liquid crystal droplets, leaving the unpaired single strands in isotropic solution. In a chemical environment where oligomer ligation is possible, such ordering and condensation would provide an autocatalytic link whereby complementarity promotes the extended polymerization of complementary oligomers."

We observed that these composites can generate a stress upon shape recovery up to two orders of magnitude greater than that generated by conventional polymers. In addition, the nanoparticles induce a broadening of the glass transition and a temperature memory with a peak of recovery stress at the temperature of their initial deformation."

Subsequent transplantation of these mice with donor HSCs led to chimerism levels of up to 90%.

https://openalex.org/W2052394132,"Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is constitutively activated in diverse human malignancies by mechanisms that are not understood. The MUC1 oncoprotein is aberrantly overexpressed by most human carcinomas and, similarly to NF-kappaB, blocks apoptosis and induces transformation. This study demonstrates that overexpression of MUC1 in human carcinoma cells is associated with constitutive activation of NF-kappaB p65. We show that MUC1 interacts with the high-molecular-weight IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex in vivo and that the MUC1 cytoplasmic domain binds directly to IKKbeta and IKKgamma. Interaction of MUC1 with both IKKbeta and IKKgamma is necessary for IKKbeta activation, resulting in phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha. Studies in non-malignant epithelial cells show that MUC1 is recruited to the TNF-R1 complex and interacts with IKKbeta-IKKgamma in response to TNFalpha stimulation. TNFalpha-induced recruitment of MUC1 is dependent on TRADD and TRAF2, but not the death-domain kinase RIP1. In addition, MUC1-mediated activation of IKKbeta is dependent on TAK1 and TAB2. These findings indicate that MUC1 is important for physiological activation of IKKbeta and that overexpression of MUC1, as found in human cancers, confers sustained induction of the IKKbeta-NF-kappaB p65 pathway."

We observed that pancreatic beta cells maintain high basal concentrations of the pyrophosphate diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (InsP7 or IP7). Inositol hexakisphosphate kinases (IP6Ks) that can generate IP7 were overexpressed. This overexpression stimulated exocytosis of insulin-containing granules from the readily releasable pool. Exogenously applied IP7 dose-dependently enhanced exocytosis at physiological concentrations. We determined that IP6K1 and IP6K2 were present in beta cells. RNA silencing of IP6K1, but not IP6K2, inhibited exocytosis, which suggests that IP6K1 is the critical endogenous kinase. Maintenance of high concentrations of IP7 in the pancreatic beta cell may enhance the immediate exocytotic capacity and consequently allow rapid adjustment of insulin secretion in response to increased demand."

Autophagy is a major mechanism for bulk degradation of proteins and organelles and is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and for cellular development during differentiation, metamorphosis, and aging. Although the process is believed to have arisen primarily as a response to starvation and stress in unicellular organisms, such as yeast, in multicellular organisms autophagy has been also linked to neurodegeneration, cardiomyopathies, pathogen infection, muscular disorders, cancer, and non-apoptotic cell death. During autophagy portions of cytoplasm are engulfed in double membrane vesicles called autophagosomes, which subsequently fuse with the lysosomes/vacuoles, thereby enabling degradation of engulfed material by lysosomal hydrolases (1Shintani T.

Among these genes, two unique ubiquitin-like systems play an important role in the early stages of autophagosome biogenesis (5Ohsumi Y. Mizushima N. Semin. Cell Dev.

The Atg12-Atg5 conjugate forms a complex with Atg16 protein (6Kuma A. Mizushima N. Ishihara N. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18619-18625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) that is thought to form a transient coat that drives the deformation of the sequestering membrane during vesicle formation. The second ubiquitin-like protein that acts on vesicle expansion and completion is Atg8. This protein is proteolytically processed by the Atg4 protease (autophagin), thereby exposing a Gly residue which is then covalently attached to a phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) moiety by the concerted action of Atg7 and Atg3 proteins, the latter being a specific E2-like conjugating enzyme (7Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). This enables the previously cytosolic Atg8 protein to tightly associate with the membranes (8Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J.

Before fusion with the vacuole, Atg8 is deconjugated from PE in the outer membrane by Atg4 and released to the cytosol to be reused for new vesicle formation (9Kirisako T. Ichimura Y. Okada H.

In yeast, autophagy overlaps with a biosynthetic process termed the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway. The Cvt pathway is an example of a specific type of autophagy where some proteins that are destined to become resident vacuolar hydrolases are synthesized in the cytosol followed by specific packaging into vesicles and delivery to the vacuole (10Harding T.M.

T. cruzi has a complex life cycle, including two replicative forms, the epimastigote present in the gut of the insect vector and the amastigote, an intracellular form in the infected mammal, and two infective, non-replicative forms, the metacyclic trypomastigote in the insect vector and the bloodstream trypomastigote released from infected cells into the blood of the mammal (15De Souza W.

Transitions between the hosts as well as changes in the replicative environment are accompanied by extensive metabolic and morphological changes of the parasite. Proteasome and cruzipain were suggested to be involved in these differentiation processes (16Gonzalez J. Ramalho-Pinto F.J. Frevert U. Ghiso J. Tomlinson S. Scharfstein J. Corey E.J. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1909-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 17Cazzulo J.J. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2002; 2: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar); however, the molecular mechanism has not been elucidated. Because differentiation in higher organisms is known to involve autophagy, it was reasonable to hypothesize that autophagy could be involved in T. cruzi differentiation.In this work we report that the T. cruzi genome contains all the major genes of the Atg8 conjugation system (Atg3, Atg4, Atg7, Atg8), whereas the major components of the Atg12-Atg5 conjugation system (Atg12, Atg5, Atg10) are apparently lacking. The two recombinant T. cruzi autophagins (Atg4 proteases) were found to process the two recombinant Atg8 homologues at the Gly residue. Moreover, all the T. cruzi Atg4, and to a lesser extent Atg8 homologues were found to substitute the yeast homologues in functional assays. Apart from starvation, autophagy was also substantially enhanced during differentiation of the parasite, a process that is essential for survival of the parasite.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESParasitesThe different forms of T. cruzi CL Brener cloned stock (18Zingales B. Pereira M.E. Almeida K.A. Umezawa E.S. Nehme N.S. Oliveira R.P. Macedo A. Souto R.P. Mem. Inst.

FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 124: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Epimastigotes were routinely grown in brain-heart-tryptose (BHT) medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. For starvation induction, mid-log parasites (50 × 106/ml) were washed twice with PBS (10 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2), resuspended in the same buffer at equal cell concentration, and incubated for 16 h at 28 °C as previously described (20Sylvester D. Krassner S.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1976; 55: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Bioinformatics Analysis of T. cruzi GenomeBLAST searches were performed against the predicted ATG-related proteins contained in version 3 of the T. cruzi genome sequences (14El-Sayed N.M.

Amino acid sequences corresponding to the C54 family peptidase domain (21Rawlings N.D. Morton F.R. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) in ATG4-like genes were used for alignment with ClustalW program, and their score values were taken as percentage of identity between two sequences. A similar analysis was performed for the ATG8-like genes analysis on the basis of the deduced amino acid sequences from the N-terminal Met to the conserved Gly residue at the predicted autophagin cleavage site.Expression and Purification of Recombinant Atg4 and Atg8 ProteinsThe sequences corresponding to TcATG4.1, TcATG4.2, TcATG8.1, and TcATG8.2 were obtained by high fidelity PCR with genomic DNA from T. cruzi epimastigotes as template (GenBank™ accession numbers DQ768297, DQ768298, DQ768299, and DQ768300). DNA was prepared using the conventional proteinase K phenol-chloroform method (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. 2nd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.14-9.19Google Scholar). Primers were designed according to the sequence data obtained from the T. cruzi Genome Project data base search. For TcATG4.1 and TcATG4.2 the primers introduced an NdeI site 5′ to the start codon and a BamHI site 3′ to the stop codon. Similarly, cloning sites for NcoI and BamHI were added to TcATG8.1 and TcATG8.2. The sequences of the primers were as follows: TcATG4.1 sense primer 5′-AACATATGCAAGGTACAATGACG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AAGGATCCTCAAGAAGAAAAAGTGTCCTC-3′; TcATG4.2 sense primer 5′-AACATATGGAGTGGTTGAAAATTG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AAGGATCCTACTCCGCCACGTCC-3′; TcATG8.1 sense primer 5′-AACCATGGCGCAAAGAAATTG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AAGGATCCCACCAAGAACCAAAAGTTG-3′; TcATG8.2 sense primer 5′-AACCATGGCACGCAAATATCGCTACCA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AAGGATCCGAATTCCGCCGCACAGCCG-3′. Each resulting DNA fragment was gel-purified by Qiaquick columns (Qiagen), cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), and completely sequenced (Macrogen, DNA sequencing service, Seoul, Korea). Inserts were liberated with the appropriate restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs) and cloned into the pET-28a(+) bacterial expression vector (Novagen). A His6 tag was added to the N termini of TcATG4.1 and TcATG4.2, whereas 21 amino acid residues including a His6 tag were added to the C termini of TcATG8.1 and TcATG8.2. These constructs were used to transform Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells followed by the induction of protein expression by 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 18 °C for 8 h for TcAtg4.1 and TcAtg4.2 and at 28 °C for 4.5 h for TcAtg8.1 and TcAtg8.2, respectively. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min and frozen. After thawing at 4 °C, cells were resuspended in buffer 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, lysed, and sonicated, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were directly applied to fast flow Ni-NTA columns (Amersham Biosciences) followed by a washing step with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl. Finally, proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 150 mm imidazole. Eluates containing the recombinant proteins were pooled, and buffer was changed to TBS (Tris-HCl 50 mm, NaCl 150 mm, pH 7.6) using PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences). TcAtg8.1 and TcAtg8.2 were further purified using size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75; Amersham Biosciences).Production of Polyclonal AntiseraAnti-TcAtg8.1 and anti-TcAtg8.2 antibodies were raised in rabbits by standard protocols using the purified recombinant proteins.In Vitro Cleavage Assay of Recombinant TcAtg8 by Recombinant TcAtg4 ProteinsPurified TcAtg8.1 or TcAtg8.2 (17.2 μg) recombinant proteins were mixed with different amounts of purified recombinant autophagins (750 ng-7.5 pg for autophagin-1 and 1.0-0.01 μg for autophagin-2) in 100 μl of TBS containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol. The reaction mixtures containing autophagin-1 were incubated at room temperature for 35 min and those containing autophagin-2 for 18 h. The reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer and 5 min of boiling. 20 μl of each sample were separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. To determine the protease class, the experiments were carried out in the presence of different inhibitors (2 mm iodoacetamide, 2.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 100 μm E-64, 39 ng/μl cystatin C, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm o-phenanthroline, or 10 μm pepstatin). To determine the exact cleavage site in TcAtg8 proteins, similar reaction solutions were applied to a C8 reverse phase Aquapore RP-300 Brownlee™ column (Applied Biosystems) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were eluted with an acetonitrile gradient 0-90% (v/v) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v). The fraction corresponding to the peak that only appeared after treatment with autophagin was freeze-dried. N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined with Procise Protein Sequencing System 492 (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's instructions.Enzymatic AssaysEnzymatic activity of recombinant autophagins was tested using Abz-TFGQ-EDDnp, where Abz is the ortho-aminobenzoic acid fluorescent group, and EDDnp is N-(ethylenediamine)-2,4-dinitrophenylamide, a quenching group (kindly provided by Dr. Luiz Juliano, Sao Paulo, Brazil) (23Melo R.L. Alves L.C. Del Nery E. Juliano L. Juliano M.A. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This peptide was designed based on the TcAtg8.1 cleavage site (TFG ↓). Activity measurements were performed in 96-well plates in TBS buffer containing 2 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml substrate (final concentration) at 30 °C. The reactions were started by the addition of 2 μg of either autophagin to the reaction mixture. Fluorescence was measured in a Safire plate reader (Tecan) for 30 min at excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 and 420 nm, respectively.Detection of Autophagin Activity in T. cruzi Cell-free ExtractsExtracts of the four T. cruzi developmental stages were prepared by resuspending the parasites in TBS containing 1 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, 100 μm E-64, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2.5 mm EDTA. Cells were broken by three cycles of freezing at -20 °C and thawing, and the cell-free extracts were obtained by centrifugation at 26,900 × g. Lysates (100 μg of protein) were then added to 17.2 μg of recombinant TcAtg8.1 or TcAtg8.2 in TBS containing 1 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm o-phenanthroline, and 10 μm E-64. Where indicated, equivalent reactions were inhibited by 3 mm iodoacetamide. The reactions were incubated for 18 h at room temperature and stopped with Laemmli sample buffer. One-third of each mixture was loaded on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). To detect the cleavage fragments, antisera raised against recombinant TcAtg8.1 or TcAtg8.2 were used as primary antibodies, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was used as secondary antibody. The blots were developed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidine salt and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride.Yeast Complementation StudiesBamHI and NotI sites were introduced at the 5′- and the 3′-ends of TcATG4.1, TcATG4.2, TcATG8.1, and TcATG8.2 genes by PCR using the following primers: for TcATG4.1, sense primer 5′-TTAGGATCCATGCAAGGTACAATGACG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AATGCGGCCGCTCAAGAAAAAGTGTC-3′; for TcATG4.2, sense primer 5′-TTAGGATCCATGGAGTGGTTGAAAATTG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AATGCGGCCGCTACTCCGCCACGTCC-3′; for TcATG8.1, sense primer 5′-TTAGGATCCATGGCGCCAAAGAAA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AATGCGGCCGCTCACCAAGAACCAAAAGTTG-3′; for TcATG8.2, sense primer 5′-TTAGGATCCATGGCACGCAAATATC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AATGCGGCCGCTCAATTCCGCCGCACAGC-3′. Inserts were cloned into the pCM190 vector (24Gari E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) and used to transform atg4Δ and atg8Δ WCG strains of S. cerevisiae (kindly provided by Dr. M. Thumm) by the lithium acetate method (25Ausubel F. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1998: 13.7.1-13.7.10Google Scholar). Transformant cultures and wild type control WCG yeast strain were grown in yeast nitrogen base media containing 0.5% ammonium sulfate containing amino acids but lacking uracil until an optical density of 1 at 600 nm was reached. Cells were subsequently split into two aliquots. The first was centrifuged, and cells were resuspended in 1% potassium acetate and grown for additional 7 h to induce starvation response. Fresh growth medium was added to the second aliquot as a control. Cultures were centrifuged, Laemmli sample buffer and glass beads were added to the harvested cells, and the mixture was vortexed vigorously to break cell walls. Yeast proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunodetection was performed with anti-(pro)aminopeptidase I primary antibodies (gift from I. V. Sandoval and M. J. Mazón) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. The antigens were visualized with ECL™ detection system (Amersham Biosciences).Generation of ATG8 Transfectant EpimastigotesHemagglutinin (HA) tags and restriction sites for BamHI and XhoI were introduced at the N termini of TcATG8.1 and TcATG8.2 using the following primers: TcATG8.1 sense primer 5′-TAGGATCCATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCGCCAAAGAAATTGGAGAGC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATCTCGAGTCACCAAGAACCAAAAGTTGCCTC-3′; TcATG8.2 sense primer 5′-TAGGATCCATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTCCACGCAAATATCGCTACCAGCG and reverse primer 5′-TTCTCGAGCTAATTCCGCCGCACAGCCGCAC-3′. The corresponding DNA fragments were cloned into the pRibotex plasmid (26Martinez-Calvillo S. Lopez I. Hernandez R. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 199: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and completely sequenced. Plasmid constructs for TcATG8.1G121A and TcATG8.2G131A were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quik-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) The following primers were used: for pRibotex-HA-ATG8.1G121A, sense primer 5′-GGTGAGGCAACTTTTGCTTCTTGGTGACTCGAG-3′ and its reverse complement as reverse primer; for p-Ribotex-HA-ATG8.2G131A, sense primer 5′-ATTGAGAGCGCCTTTGCCGGTGCGCTGTGCGG-3′ and its reverse complement as reverse primer. Mutation was verified by automatic DNA sequencing. These four constructs were used to transfect T. cruzi epimastigotes as previously described (27Kosec G. Alvarez V.E. Aguero F. Sanchez D. Dolinar M. Turk B. Turk V. Cazzulo J.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 145: 18-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence StudiesThe parasites were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Next, the cells were washed twice with PBS, incubated for 10 min with 25 mm ammonium chloride, and washed again twice with PBS. Coverslides were saturated in the blocking buffer (2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% saponin in PBS) containing 3% goat serum for 30 min and incubated for 2 h with the primary antibody diluted in the blocking buffer. Parasites were then washed with PBS and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody diluted in the blocking buffer for 1 h. After extensive washing with PBS, coverslides were mounted using Fluor-Save™ reagent (Calbiochem) containing 5 μg/ml DAPI. The following primary antibodies were used: rat anti-HA high affinity monoclonal antibodies (Roche Applied Science) (1/500 dilution), rabbit anti-Atg8.1 polyclonal antibodies (1/700 dilution), and mouse anti-TcSCP (T. cruzi serine carboxypeptidase) polyclonal antibodies as a lysosomal/reservosomal marker (1/1000) (28Parussini F. Garcia M. Mucci J. Aguero F. Sanchez D. Hellman U. Aslund L. Cazzulo J.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 131: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The secondary antibodies used were AlexaFluor 546-conjugated goat anti-rat, AlexaFluor 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, and AlexaFluor 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Molecular Probes), all diluted 1/1000. Preparations were analyzed using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse E600), and image capture was performed by a Spot RT Slider Model 2.3.1 digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments). The number of Atg8.1 positive vesicles within untransfected T. cruzi epimastigotes was quantified by observing at least 70 cells from three independent experiments.Transmission Electron MicroscopyParasites were fixed for 1 h at room temperature with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, post-fixed for 30 min with 1% OsO4, 1.25% potassium ferrocyanide, and 5 mm CaCl2 in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, dehydrated in an ascending ethanol series, and embedded in Epon resin. Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and then examined in a Zeiss 902 electron microscope operating at 80 kV.RESULTSIdentification of Candidate Autophagosome Formation Genes in the T. cruzi GenomeThe remarkable conservation of the genes involved in autophagy from yeast to human provides an excellent starting point toward identification of the autophagy-related genes in various organisms. Using BLAST analysis, the T. cruzi genome (14El-Sayed N.M. Myler P.J. Bartholomeu D.C. Nilsson D. Aggarwal G. Tran A.N. Ghedin E. Worthey E.A. Delcher A.L. Blandin G. Westenberger S.J. Caler E.

Science. 2005; 309: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar) was searched for sequences related to the Atg8-PE and Atg12-Atg5 conjugation systems, which represent the two major components of the autophagic machinery.Surprisingly, BLAST analysis failed to identify most of the genes specifically involved in Atg12 conjugation. These included the ATG12 gene encoding an ubiquitin-like protein, which is the most important, as well as the genes encoding two other components of this pathway, ATG5 and ATG10. The only two sequences identified were both homologous to ATG16, which is, however, a downstream gene in the pathway (supplemental Table 1). This further suggests that the Atg-12-Atg5 conjugation system is most likely lacking in T. cruzi or at least significantly diverse from the yeast system.However, all the essential genes involved in the Atg8 conjugation system could be identified in the T. cruzi genome using the same approach (supplemental Table 1). The analysis, thus, revealed single genes homologous to the E1-enzyme Atg7 (34% identity with yeast Atg7) and the E2-enzyme Atg3 (28% identity with yeast Atg3). In contrast, two candidate genes were identified for each of the two early genes of the pathway, the ubiquitin-like modifier Atg8 and its processing protease Atg4. A detailed analysis of the two candidate genes for Atg4 protease (TcATG4.1 and TcATG4.2) revealed that they encode proteins with 30 and 20% identity to the yeast Atg4, respectively. The two genes are 21% identical with each other within the region corresponding to the catalytic domains characteristic for C54 (autophagin) family (supplemental Fig. 1). Both candidate proteases were found to contai"

Biol. 2005; 35: 573-597Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar), leading to a significant increase in the number of experimental studies and analyses of this enzyme. However, most recent functional investigations have been conducted with bacterial bc1 complexes, especially those of non-oxygenic photosynthetic purple bacteria such as R. sphaeroides and R. capsulatus (Rc). These bacterial systems contain simpler bc1 complexes consisting of either three (Rc) or four (Rs) subunits whose sequences have remained close to their mitochondrial counterparts. Chromatophore vesicles are easy to isolate in large quantities. Site-specific mutants can be readily prepared and tested in an optical pulse mode due to its coupling to the photosynthetic reaction center (28Gennis R.B. Barquera B. Hacker B. Van Doren S.R. Arnaud S. Crofts A.R. Davidson E. Gray K.A. Daldal F. J. Bioenerget. Biomembr. 2001; 25: 195-209Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Because of the importance of bacterial bc1 in functional studies, a high-resolution structure has been actively pursued for many years. The crystal structure of the bc1 complex from R. capsulatus (Rcbc1) reported at 3.8 Å resolution represented the first step toward this goal (29Berry E.A. Huang L. Saechao L.K. Pon N.G. Valkova-Valchanova M. Daldal F. Photosynthesis Res. 2004; 81: 251-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), though it lacks sufficient resolution of structural details that distinguish the bacterial form from the mitochondrial one. Here, we report the crystal structures of the wild type and mutant bc1 complex from the R. sphaeroides (Rsbc1) with bound inhibitors ranging in resolution from 3.1 to 2.4 Å. Protein Purification and Crystallization—Cyt bc1 complexes of both wild-type and double mutant S287RCytb/V135SISP from R. sphaeroides were prepared as described (30Elberry M. Xiao K. Esser L. Xia D. Yu L. Yu C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The concentrated protein solution (90 mg/ml) was diluted by a factor of six with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm NaN3, 0.5% β-OG (Anatrace), 200 mm histidine, and 2 mm diheptanoyl phosphatidyl choline (Avanti). The solution was left on ice for 12 h after adding a 5-fold molar excess of stigmatellin (Fluka). A second detergent, sucrose monocaprate (Fluka), was added to a final concentration of 0.12% followed by 10 mm strontium nitrate and 10% PEG400. The resulting solution was incubated overnight at 4 °C. A small amount of precipitation was centrifuged off and the supernatant was used in sitting drop crystallization experiments that yielded small, red, translucent crystals after 2 months of incubation at 15 °C. The reservoir solution was prepared separately and contained 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 600 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 5 mm NaN3, and 26% PEG 400. Structure Determination—Crystals of Rsbc1 were frozen without additional cryoprotectants but showed decay during the low temperature (100 K) data collection at beamline ID22D (SER-CAT) of the Advanced Photon Source (APS). Diffraction intensities were integrated with the program Denzo and merged and scaled with Scalepack (HKL2000 package) (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The structures of Rsbc1 inhibitor complexes were solved by molecular replacement (MR) using a dimeric Rsbc1 model based largely on the structure of bovine bc1 (32Yu L. Tso S.C. Shenoy S.K. Quinn B.N. Xia D. J. Bioenerget. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with minor modification as input for the program MolRep (33Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) of the CCP4 (34P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) program package. The successful solution consisted of a set of three dimers related by non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS). This model was subjected to thorough rigid body refinement and simulated annealing (35Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), followed by cycles of standard crystallographic refinement and model building in O (36Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Clear electron density for residues that were missing from the initial model in particular for insertions into cyt b and a rapid drop of Rfree confirmed the correctness of the MR solution. The final model contains continuous polypeptide chains of cyt b, cyt c1, and the ISP but none of the supernumerary subunit IV. Difference Fourier maps showed positive density for six lipid molecules, six β-OG molecules, six molecules of the substrate ubiquinone, and nine strontium ions. Throughout the refinement, NCS restraints were maintained except for a few regions at crystal contacts or in places of apparent local disorder. The structure of the wild type complex (P21) was solved by MR using a refined dimeric polypeptide-only model of the double mutant Rsbc1. A difference Fourier synthesis revealed the position of all prosthetic groups as well as the presence of both inhibitors stigmatellin and antimycin. Structure Determination and Overall Structure of the Rsbc1—The presence of the QP site inhibitor stigmatellin, the use of the amino acid histidine and a mixture of β-octyl glucopyranoside (β-OG) and sucrose monocaprate are important for obtaining high quality crystals. A batch of Rsbc1 with the double mutations S287Rcytb/V135SISP appeared to be particularly suitable for growing well-behaved crystals (37Elberry M. Yu L. Yu C.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4991-4997Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These crystals (space group C2) diffracted x-rays to 2.35 Å resolution (Table 1). Three bc1 dimers occupy the crystallographic asymmetric unit (ASU). The wild type enzyme crystallizes with two dimers per ASU (space group P21) and diffracted x-rays to 2.6 Å resolution (Table 1). Surprisingly, only the three core subunits are present in both wild type and mutant Rsbc1 crystals; apparently, subunit IV was lost upon crystal formation. The assembly of the three-subunit Rsbc1 (Fig. 1A) resembles closely that of the corresponding subunits in bovine mitochondrial bc1 (Bos taurus bc1 or Btbc1) (14Xia D. Yu C.A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), and the remarkable conservation in architectural features not only pertains to a single monomer but also to an assembled homodimer. The root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviation between the cyt b dimers of R. sphaeroides and bovine bc1 is less than 1.1 Å for 726 Cα atoms (Table 2). Consequently, the distances between prosthetic groups are virtually identical, implying functional conservation (Supplemental Table S1). As in mitochondrial bc1, the extrinsic domain of the iron-sulfur protein subunit in Rsbc1 crosses over, connecting one molecule of cyt b to the adjacent one. In contrast to the seven or eight supernumerary subunits in mitochondrial enzymes, Rsbc1 has only one. Thus, it has been speculated that supernumerary subunits represent functional or structural equivalents of the insertions, extensions, and deletions found in the sequences of the catalytic subunits of bacterial bc1 (38Liu X.

Open table in a new tab Structure of the Cytochrome b Subunit—The cyt b subunit of Rsbc1 has eight membrane spanning helices named A to H, forming two helical bundles (A-E and F-H) (Fig. 1B). The two heme groups, bL and bH, reside within the first bundle. Extra membranous loops connect pairs of transmembrane (TM) helices and those that are longer than 20 residues are the AB, CD, DE, and EF loop. The quinol oxidation site (QP, positive side, P-side) near the periplasmic side of the membrane and quinone reduction site (QN, cytoplasmic or negative side, N-side) on the opposite side can be identified with bound stigmatellin and antimycin, respectively. When compared with structures of Btbc1, Rs cyt b features two terminal extensions and two major insertions. The N- and C-terminal extensions are 22 and 29 residues long, respectively. Both contain helices named a0 and i, respectively (Figs. 1B and 3A). One insertion (de helix) is in the cytoplasmic DE loop and another (ef1 helix) inserts after the ef helix on the periplasmic side.FIGURE 3Structure-based sequence alignment of bc1 subunits.

The heme group is located and positioned identically to that of mitochondrial enzymes. Crystals of Rsbc1 grown in the presence of strontium ions revealed a metal ion-binding site on cyt c1 (Fig. 1, C and D), which is not present in mitochondrial bc1 but appears to be conserved in photosynthetic bacteria (Fig. 3B). The strontium ion, confirmed by the appearance of a strong anomalous signal from the data set collected above the strontium absorption edge, is accessible from the periplasm and coordinated by side chains of Asp8, Glu14, and Glu129 as well as by the backbone carbonyl oxygen atom of residue Val9 in a distorted octahedron. To our knowledge, this metal ion-binding site has not been described previously and its possible physiological role is currently under investigation. Structure of the Iron-Sulfur Protein Subunit—The ISP subunit has a C-terminal periplasmic head domain (extrinsic domain, ISP-ED), which connects through a flexible hinge region to its N-terminal TM helix (Fig. 1E). The ISP-ED is predominantly a β-structure consisting of three β-sheets arranged in three parallel layers with the 2Fe2S cluster located at the apex of the ISP-ED between the 2nd and 3rd β-sheet. The conserved ADV motif in the hinge region (Fig. 3C) adopts an α-helical (HA) conformation, unlike the random coil secondary structure of bovine bc1 in the space group I4122. One insertion with respect to the bovine sequence is located between Thr96 and Ala109, filling a surface depression that would otherwise exist between β-sheets 2 and 3. Inhibitor Binding Sites—Stigmatellin is a potent QP site inhibitor (39Ohnishi T. Brandt U. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and has frequently been used to arrest the mobile head domain of the ISP (26Esser L. Quinn B. Li Y. Zhang M. Elberry M. Yu L. Yu C.A. Xia D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 281-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This may be of particular importance in crystallizing the bare-bone bc1 complexes that cannot rely on lattice contacts formed by large hydrophilic core subunits (14Xia D. Yu C.A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 15Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.I. Kim K.K. Hung L.W. Crofts A.R.

Structure. 2000; 15: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (516) Google Scholar). In all Rsbc1 structures described in this work, stigmatellin is clearly visible in the difference Fourier maps and oriented in a way that bridges the side chains of the residues Glu295 (cyt b) and His152 (ISP) (Fig. 2A). The hydrophobic tail, known to contribute to the small Kd (0.4-1 nm) of stigmatellin binding (40Covian R. Pardo J.P. Moreno-Sanchez R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48449-48455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), is fully visible (Fig. 3A) and makes the same contacts as in complexes from mitochondria (17Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Structure. 2000; 15: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 26Esser L. Quinn B. Li Y. Zhang M. Elberry M. Yu L. Yu C.A. Xia D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 281-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) or in b6f complexes (19Stroebel D. Choquet Y. Popot J.L. Picot D. Nature. 2003; 426: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 41Yamashita E. Zhang H. Cramer W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 370: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Antimycin molecules were refined in all four (P21) or six copies (C2) of cyt b in the asymmetric unit. The antimycin complex of bovine cyt b superimposes very well with the corresponding Rsbc1 subunit (Fig. 2B), and the inhibitors fit nicely into the difference density observed in the latter. Antimycin binds strongly to mitochondrial bc1 with a Kd of 32 pm (42von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), but the Kd for Rsbc1 is not known. As prominent contributors to the binding energy, the formyl amide and the phenolic OH group of antimycin are in excellent hydrogen bonding distance to Asp252 (Asp228, Btbc1). However, two amino acid changes could strongly influence the binding of antimycin. The substitution of Ser35 in Btbc1 to Val49 in Rsbc1 eliminates the H-bond between the hydroxyl group of Ser and the central amide group (N2) of antimycin. It is likely that this loss of an H-bond reduces the inhibitor's binding affinity to Rs cyt b because a similar mutation (S35I) in Leishmania tarentolae cyt b increases the IC50 for antimycin by 10-20-fold (43Schnaufer A. Sbicego S. Blum B. Curr. Genet. 2000; 37: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The impact of the change from Ser205 (Bt) to Asn221 (Rs) is difficult to judge and may be restricted to a modulation of the steric interference with the aromatic moiety of antimycin. Bound antimycin was modeled in anti conformation with respect to the positions of atoms O2 (OH) and O3 (O=C), abolishing the intramolecular hydrogen bond that was proposed to be essential for its recognition (44Miyoshi H. Tokutake N. Imaeda Y. Akagi T. Iwamura H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and indeed found in the free structure (45Kim H. Esser L. Hossain M.B. Xia D. Yu C.A. Rizo J. van der Helm D. Deisenhofer J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 4902-4903Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It appears that the conclusion that this intramolecular hydrogen bond is essential, drawn from a synthetic analogue of antimycin, cannot be maintained, as recent high resolution structures (27Huang L. Cobessi D. Tung E.Y. Berry E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 35: 573-597Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar) 3D. Xia, unpublished results. agree better with the anti conformation. Insertions and Deletions in Rsbc1 Relative to Mitochondrial bc1—When sequences of mitochondrial bc1 and Rsbc1 are compared, the latter often possesses more insertions than deletions. Remarkably, the insertions occur only on or near the periplasmic or cytoplasmic side and not within the transmembrane region (Fig. 1). An understanding of the functions of these additions or deletions may provide insight into the evolutionary process that transformed the bacterial enzyme into its mitochondrial equivalent. Characteristic of this process is the addition of supernumerary subunits that possibly provide structural stability and functional integrity to the enzyme (3Trumpower B.L. Microbiological Rev. 1990; 54: 101-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Roles of the Additions in Cyt b—Cyt b of Rsbc1 is 66 residues longer than its bovine mitochondrial equivalent. As seen in the structure-based sequence alignment and from its structure (Figs. 1B and 3A), bacterial bc1 has extensions at both termini (a0 and i helices), a helical insertion between the D and E helices (de helix) as well as an insertion between the ef-loop and the F helix (ef1 helix). In the structure, the C terminus of cyt b is visible up to residue 430, consistent with the observation that deletion of the last 15 residues does not affect the function of Rsbc1 (38Liu X. Yu C.A.

https://openalex.org/W2077647411,"Efficient clearance of apoptotic cells is essential for tissue homeostasis, allowing for cellular turnover without inflammatory consequences. The Mer (Nyk and c-Eyk) receptor tyrosine kinase (Mertk) is involved in two aspects of apoptotic cell clearance by acting as a receptor for Gas6, a γ-carboxylated phosphatidylserine-binding protein that bridges apoptotic and viable cells. First, Mertk acts in a bona fide engulfment pathway in concert with αvβ5 integrin by regulating cytoskeletal assemblages, and second, it acts as a negative regulator for inflammation by down-modulating pro-inflammatory signals mediated from bacterial lipopolysaccharide-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling, and hence recapitulating anti-inflammatory immune modulation by apoptotic cells. Here we describe Mertk post-receptor events that govern phagocytosis and cytoskeletal signaling are principally mediated by autophosphorylation site Tyr-867. Using the Mertk Y867F mutant and pharmacological inhibitors, we show that Tyr-867 is required for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phospholipase Cγ2 activation; their activation in turn elicits protein kinase C-dependent signals that act on the actin cytoskeleton. Although MertkY867F blocked the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK on Tyr-861 and p130cas and also abrogated the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, this mutant did not suppress lipopolysaccharide-inducible NF-κB transcription, nor was NF-κB activation dependent on the protein kinase C inhibitor, calphostin C. Finally, unlike the cytoskeletal events associated with Tyr-867 autophosphorylation, the trans-inhibition of NF-κB occurred in a postnuclear-dependent fashion independent of cytosolic IκB phosphorylation and p65/RelA sequestration. Taken together, these data suggest that Mertk has distinct and separable effects for phagocytosis and for resolving inflammation, providing a molecular rationale for how immune licensing and inflammation can be dissociated from phagocytosis in a single phagocytic receptor."

Based on the convertase furin, to fold properly and gain activity, the convertases PC5A, PACE4, and PC7 are presumed to undergo two sequential prosegment cleavages in the endoplasmic reticulum and then in the trans-Golgi network. However, biochemical and immunocytochemical experiments revealed that mouse PC5A is complexed to its prosegment at the plasma membrane. This labeling is lost upon treatment with heparin and is increased by overexpressing members of the syndecan family and CD44, suggesting attachment of secreted PC5A-prosegment complex to heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Following stimulation of Y1 cells with adrenocorticotropic hormone or 8-bromo-cyclic AMP, the cell surface labeling of the prosegment of PC5A is greatly diminished, whereas the signal for mature PC5A is increased. Moreover, after stimulation, the protease activity of PC5A is enhanced, as evidenced by the cleavage of the PC5A substrates Lefty, ADAMTS-4, endothelial lipase, and PCSK9. Our data suggest a novel mechanism for PC5A activation and substrate cleavage at the cell surface, through a regulated removal of its prosegment. A similar mechanism may also apply to the convertase PACE4, thereby extending our knowledge of the molecular details of the zymogen activation and functions of these heparan sulfate proteoglycan-bound convertases.

The mammalian genome is predicted to express ∼30,000 genes. The estimated number of primary protein products is, however, many times higher, mainly due to alternative splicing events and post-translational modifications, including irreversible proteolytic cleavage. Proteinases either degrade proteins via multiple cleavages or participate in their limited proteolysis, thereby raising the number of active products that can be generated from a single proprotein. Less frequently, a specific cleavage inactivates the substrate.

Seven basic amino acid (aa)-specific PCs are related to yeast kexin: PC1 (also known as PC3), PC2, furin, PC4, PC5 (also known as PC6 or PC5/6), PACE4, and PC7. These cleave protein substrates after single or paired basic amino acids within the motif (R/K)Xn(R/K)↓, where Xn represents 0, 2, 4, or 6 variable aa separating the two canonical basic residues required for cleavage recognition. Metallocarboxypeptidases then remove the carboxyl-terminal basic residues exposed by the convertases, a process shown to be necessary for the elaboration of biological activity of several polypeptides and proteins (7Arolas J.L. Vendrell J. Aviles F.X. Fricker L.D. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2007; 13: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Many biologically active peptides ending at G(R/K) once trimmed by a basic amino acid-specific metallocarboxypeptidase are also COOH-terminally amidated by peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (8Prigge S.T. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Amzel L.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1236-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The other two convertases, SKI-1/S1P and PCSK9, cleave at nonbasic residues and are known for their key role in cholesterol homeostasis (3Seidah N.G. Prat A. J. Mol.

PC5 is indispensable for early development, since its knockout in mice is embryonic lethal (9Essalmani R. Hamelin J. Marcinkiewicz J. Chamberland A. Mbikay M. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Prat A. Mol.

Ontogeny and tissue distribution analysis of PC5 expression revealed that it is dominant in somites at embryonic day 9.5, in lungs, pancreatic and adrenal primordia, intestinal tract, and kidney cortex (9Essalmani R.

In addition, PC5 seems to be implicated in specific pathologies, such as atherosclerosis and cancer metastasis, by activating matrix metalloproteases (10Stawowy P. Meyborg H. Stibenz D. Borges Pereira S.N. Roser M. Thanabalasingam U. Veinot J.P. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Fleck E. Graf K.

Schachner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10381-10388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), respectively. The PC5 gene encodes two isoforms generated by alternative splicing, resulting in either PC5A (915 aa; 21 exons) or PC5B (1877 aa; 38 exons) (2Seidah N.G. Prat A. Essays Biochem. 2002; 38: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). PC5A is sorted to both the constitutive and regulated secretory pathways, whereas PC5B traffics only within the constitutive secretory pathway (12De Bie I. Marcinkiewicz M. Malide D. Lazure C.

The membrane-bound PC5B, furin, and PC7 cycle from the cell surface back to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) through endosomes, a pathway regulated by signals in their cytosolic tails.

The secreted PC5A and PACE4, which are devoid of a transmembrane domain, contain a COOH-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that interacts with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMPs), and allow the formation of a ternary complex with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (17Nour N.

Thus, like furin, PC5A and PACE4 are present at the cell surface, where they may contribute to the cleavage of HSPG-bound proteins, such as endothelial and lipoprotein lipases (18Jin W. Millar J.S.

Before they can act on protein substrates, PCs themselves must go through an ordered process of activation. PCs are initially synthesized as inactive zymogens in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Upon folding, they undergo an autocatalytic processing in the ER (except for PC2) downstream of their NH2-terminal prosegment, resulting in a noncovalent but tight binding complex of the inhibitory prosegment with the protease. This first zymogen cleavage is necessary to allow the PC to exit the ER for secretion, since the prosegment acts as an intramolecular chaperone allowing the proper folding of the enzyme (12De Bie I.

A second autocatalytic cleavage event is then needed to liberate the protease from its prosegment, thus specifying the location within the cell where the PC is activated and can then cut substrates in trans. Although furin is activated following the dissociation of its prosegment in the TGN (22Anderson E.D. VanSlyke J.K. Thulin C.D. Jean F. Thomas G.

In the present study, we provide evidence for the cell surface activation of PC5A. The complex prosegment-PC5A is anchored at the plasma membrane via HSPGs, such as syndecans and CD44. The activation of PC5A is stimulated by incubation of Y1 cells with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or 8-Br-cAMP. Such regulated activation of PC5A triggered the cell surface endoproteolytic processing of its cognate substrates Lefty, endothelial lipase, ADAMTS-4, and PCSK9. This mode of activation is unique among the PCs and provides novel insight into the regulation and site-specific cleavages of protein substrates. Expression Constructs—Mouse PC5A, mouse PC5B, human PACE4, human furin, human PCSK9, and all of their mutant cDNAs and domains were cloned, with or without a COOH-terminal V5 tag, into pIRES2-EGFP vector (Clontech) as described previously (17Nour N.

The cDNA coding for human Lefty-A (pcDNA3.1 vector) was reported previously (26Ulloa L. Creemers J.W. Roy S. Liu S. Mason J. Tabibzadeh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21387-21396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding for human CD44 containing the variably expressed exon 3 (MGC-10468; American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)) was cloned into NheI/BamHI-digested pIRES2-EGFP. cDNAs encoding for GPI-GFP, mouse TIMP-3 (phCMV3 vector), human ADAMTS-4 and -5 (pCEP4 and pSG6 vectors, respectively), Myc-tagged human endothelial lipase (pcDNA3.1-Myc-His vector), and rat syndecan-2 and -4 (pcDNA3.1 vector) were kindly provided by Drs. Sergio Grinstein (University of Toronto), John S. Mort (McGill University), Linda Troeberg (Imperial College London), Daniel J. Rader (University of Pennsylvania), and Eok-Soo Oh (Ewha Womans University, Seoul), respectively. All cDNAs were sequenced to ensure that no errors occurred during the cloning procedures. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Cell Treatments—COS-1 and HEK293 cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), whereas CHO-K1, furin-deficient CHO-FD11 (27Gordon V.M. Klimpel K.R. Arora N. Henderson M.A. Leppla S.H. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 82-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and heparan sulfate-deficient CHO-pgsD-677 (ATCC) (28Lidholt K. Weinke J.L. Kiser C.S.

Y1 adrenocortical cells (ATCC) were grown in F12K medium with 15% horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum. All cells were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2. At about 80-90% confluence, cells were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) except for Y1 and HEK293 cells that were transfected with Effectene (Qiagen). Stable transfectants of pIRES2-EGFP-PCSK9-V5 were obtained in HEK293 cells following G418 selection. Cells, nontransfected or 24 h post-transfection, were washed with serum-free medium and incubated either alone or in combination, as indicated in the figure legends, with 200 nm human ACTH (fragment 1-24), 5 mm 8-Br-cAMP, 10 mm ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), 20 μm recombinant human TIMP-3, 0.5 mg/ml suramin, 1 mg/ml heparin, 0.5 units/ml heparinase III, 3 units/ml phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (all obtained from Sigma), 25 μm decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone (CMK; Bachem), or 25 μm GM6001 (EMD Biosciences), in serum-free medium at 37 °C for 16 h or 1 h for suramin and heparin. Following treatments, cells and conditioned media were collected for Western blot analyses, or cells were used for immunocytochemistry as described below. In some experiments, cells were also surface-biotinylated prior to lysis, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting (see below). Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonals against the prosegment of PC5 (Ab:pPC5) or the prosegment of furin (Ab:pfurin) were raised in house as described (24Nour N. Basak A. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol.

Rabbit polyclonals against PC5 recognizing both A and B isoforms (Ab:PC5) or specific for the B isoform (Ab:PC5B) were a kind gift from John Creemers (University of Leuven, Belgium). Other antibodies used were the unconjugated or horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated mouse anti-V5 tag antibodies (mAb:V5 or mAb:V5-HRP; Invitrogen), rabbit anti-syndecan-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), HRP-conjugated mouse anti-Myc tag (Invitrogen), goat anti-Lefty (R&D Systems), rabbit anti-ADAMTS-4 (Sigma), rabbit anti-TIMP-3 (rAb: TIMP-3; Chemicon), and goat anti-TIMP-3 (gAb:TIMP-3; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cell Surface Biotinylation, Immunoprecipitations, and Western Blotting—For biochemical detection of PC5 and its prosegment at the plasma membrane, cells transiently transfected with FL-PC5A were scraped from plates, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) adjusted to pH 8.0, and biotinylated with 0.2 mg of sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotin-amido)hexanoate) (Pierce) per ml of cell suspension for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed with 100 mm glycine in PBS, pH 8.0, to quench the reaction. Surface biotinylation of cells transfected with TIMP-3 was done on adherent cells in culture plates and processed as described above. As a control for surface biotinylation, cells were treated with 0.05% trypsin, 0.5 mm EDTA for 20 min on ice to discard all cell surface proteins (30Somerville R.P. Longpre J.M. Apel E.D. Lewis R.M.

Trypsin was inactivated with 10% fetal bovine serum-supplemented medium, and cells were then washed with PBS. Cell lysis was performed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). For immunoprecipitation after surface biotinylation, cell lysates were precleared with protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with Ab:pPC5 or Ab:PC5 (dilution 1:100). Protein A/G-agarose beads were then added to the antigen-antibody complexes, incubated for 4 h, and washed six times with cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Lysates of biotinylated TIMP-3-transfected cells were incubated with streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C and washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Following the addition of reducing Laemmli sample buffer, the protein samples were heated, resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 10% Tricine gel, electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose, probed with streptavidin-HRP (1:20,000; GE Healthcare) or with rAb: TIMP-3 (1:2000) and a secondary HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:10,000), and revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). For immunoprecipitation of ADAMTS-4, cell lysates were precleared, incubated with the anti-ADAMTS-4 antibody (1:100), and then with protein A/G-agarose beads as described above. SDS-PAGE (10% glycine gel) and Western blotting were performed with the anti-ADAMTS-4 antibody (1:2000) as described below. Western blotting experiments were made on media or cell lysates that were reduced in Laemmli buffer, heated, and resolved either on 10% glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels or on 10% Tricine gels for detection of the prosegment of PC5A. Separated proteins were then electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose and probed either with Ab:pPC5 (1:2000), anti-Myc-HRP (1:5000), anti-Lefty (1:2000), anti-ADAMTS-4 (1:2000), rAb-TIMP-3 (1:2000), or mAb:V5-HRP (1:5000). Bound antibodies were detected with corresponding HRP-labeled secondary antibodies, the anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (1:10,000) or the anti-goat IgG-HRP (1:100,000) (Sigma), and revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Immunocytochemistry—For immunocytochemistry, cells were plated on glass bottom culture dishes (MatTek) and then either left nontransfected or transfected the following day. When indicated, cell treatments were made 24 h after transfection as described above. 48 h post-transfection, the cells were washed three times with PBS. Cell surface labelings were made under nonpermeabilizing conditions by fixation with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. For intracellular immunolabelings, cells were fixed and permeabilized in methanol/acetone (1:1) for 3 min at -20 °C. Cells were then washed in PBS, incubated for 5 min in 150 mm glycine, washed once in PBS, and incubated for 30 min in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with Ab:pPC5, Ab:pfurin, Ab:PC5, gAb:TIMP-3 (all diluted 1:100 in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin), Ab:PC5B (1:200), anti-syndecan-2 (1:20), or mAb:V5 (1:200) and then washed four times with PBS. Antigen-antibody complexes were revealed by incubation for 45 min at room temperature with corresponding secondary antibodies, anti-rabbit IgG-, anti-mouse IgG-, or anti-goat IgG-coupled either to Alexa-fluor-555 (red), 488 (green), or 647 (blue) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) as described in the figure legends. After several washes in PBS, cells were covered with 5% 1,4-diazabicyclo(2.2.2)octane (Sigma) in PBS/glycerol 90%, and immunofluorescence analyses were performed with a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal microscope. Quantifications of the fluorescence intensity were done with the freely available ImageJ software version 1.37 (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). In Situ Hybridization—10-12-μm-thick cryosections were prepared from adult mice (whole body sections), fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and hybridized as previously described (31Marcinkiewicz M. Marcinkiewicz J. Chen A. Leclaire F. Chretien M. Richardson P. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 403: 471-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 32Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Wickham L. Marcinkiewicz J.

The latter probes corresponded to the mouse PC5 coding region (807 bases; nucleotides 262-1068; NCBI accession number L14932) and mouse Lefty-1 (365 bases; nucleotides 713-1078; NCBI accession number NM_010094). The probes were synthesized using [35S]UTP and [35S]CTP (>1000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). For autoradiography, the sections were dipped in photographic emulsion (NTB-2; Eastman Kodak Co.), exposed for 6-12 days, and developed in D19 solution (Kodak). In Vitro Activity Assay—Enzymatic in vitro assays were performed in 100 μl of buffer (1 mm CaCl2, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 25 mm MES buffer, pH 7.5) at 37 °C in the presence of 50 μm substrate pyroglutamic acid-RTKR-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin and 80 μl of medium from Y1 cells treated or untreated with ACTH overnight. The release of free 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin was detected with a Spectra MAX GEMINI EM microplate spectrofluorimeter (Molecular Devices) (excitation, 360 nm; emission, 460 nm). HSPGs Are Required for the Cell Surface Anchoring of PC5A and PACE4—Our previous observations have shown that the secreted PC5A and PACE4 can be anchored to the cell surface through their CRD (17Nour N. Mayer G. Mort J.S. Salvas A. Mbikay M. Morrison C.J. Overall C.M. Seidah N.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5215-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In order to extend these results, the molecules responsible for this plasma membrane tethering were studied. COS-1 and CHO-K1 cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding either full-length PC5A (FL-PC5A) or PACE4 (FL-PACE4), their CRD-deleted versions (PC5A-ΔC and PACE4-ΔC), or the CRDs alone (PC5A-CRD and PACE4-CRD), all containing a COOH-terminal V5 tag (supplemental Fig. S1). The COOH-terminal V5 tag did not affect the immunolocalization of PC5, since it was similar to that obtained with Ab:PC5 on cells expressing PC5A without the tag (not shown). Using an anti-V5 tag monoclonal antibody (mAb:V5), the cell surface localization of PC5A and PACE4 was analyzed by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1). In both COS-1 and CHO-K1 cells, there was an intense punctate cell surface staining of PC5A or PACE4 (Fig. 1, A, E, and G). However, this labeling was completely lost when the cells were transfected with cDNA constructs encoding the CRD-deleted versions of the convertases (Fig. 1D, insets in E and G). The CRDs seem to be sufficient for plasma membrane localization of each convertase, since overexpressing their CRDs alone gave a strong cell surface signal (Fig. 1, F and H). To determine how this binding occurs, COS-1 cells expressing FL-PC5A were treated with suramin, a highly sulfated compound or with heparinase III, which cleaves at the 1,4 linkages between hexosamine and glucuronic acid residues in heparan sulfate, thereby removing cell surface heparan sulfate chains. Such treatments resulted in the release of PC5A from the surface, as shown by the significant decrease in immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 1, B and C). These results indicate that HSPGs are candidate cell surface binding proteins of secreted PCs. The critical contribution of HSPGs was analyzed directly by using the CHO-pgsD-677 cells, which specifically lack heparan sulfate but still synthesize chondroitin sulfate (28Lidholt K. Weinke J.L. Kiser C.S. Lugemwa F.N. Bame K.J. Cheifetz S. Massague J. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Immunolabelings of pgsD-677 cells expressing FL-PC5A, FL-PACE4, or the CRDs alone revealed no signal at the plasma membrane, demonstrating that PC5A and PACE4 are anchored at the cell surface through binding of their CRD to HSPGs (Fig. 1, I-L). The plasma membrane-anchored HSPGs include those having a transmembrane domain, such as syndecans and CD44, and those bearing a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, such as glypicans (33Kramer K.L. Yost H.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 461-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Cell surface tethering of PC5A through glypicans was assessed by treating COS-1 cells expressing FL-PC5A with the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. Such treatment led to a small decrease in the intensity of staining of PC5A, pointing out that these HSPGs were not the major plasma membrane PC5A binding proteins in COS-1 cells (Fig. S2). Pursuing our quest to find HSPGs that can anchor PC5A at the membrane, COS-1 cells were co-transfected with FL-PC5A together with syndecan-2, syndecan-4, or CD44 (Fig. 2). Cell surface immunofluorescence analysis of PC5A showed an increased intensity in the presence of all three HSPGs compared with co-expression with an empty vector (Fig. 2, A-C). Confocal analysis of z-series optical sections revealed that the punctate staining was enhanced over all surface areas of the cells, with possibly some preferential accumulation of PC5A in apical versus basolateral membranes (Fig. 2, A′ and B′). Quantification of the fluorescence intensity revealed an increase of cell surface PC5A over control by ∼75% with syndecan-2, by ∼40% with syndecan-4, and up to 100% with CD44 (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, double labeling experiments showed the co-localization of PC5A with syndecan-2 at the cell surface of transfected COS-1 cells (Fig. 2, E-G). Finally, expression of syndecan-2 in pgsD-677 cells did not result in cell surface anchoring of PC5A (data not shown), probably because of the absence of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase and glucuronyltransferase activities in this cell line (28Lidholt K. Weinke J.L. Kiser C.S. Lugemwa F.N. Bame K.J. Cheifetz S. Massague J. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This emphasizes the critical importance of heparan sulfate chains for the association of PC5A at the cell surface. The Prosegment-PC5A Complex Is Secreted and Anchored to the Cell Surface—Although the presence of PC5A at the cell surface could be necessary to process HSPG-bound proteins, we hypothesized that HSPGs may also be required for the activation of PC5A. Previous reports showed that within the ER, the zymogen proPC5A is autocatalytically cleaved at KKRTKR116↓ (Fig. 3A, site 1°) (12De Bie I. Marcinkiewicz M. Malide D. Lazure C. Nakayama K. Bendayan M.

Expression of E2F3 isoforms (E2F3a and b) and CDKAL1 were examined and modulated in 6p22-amplified bladder cell lines. Eight lines with amplification showed overexpression of both E2F3 isoforms and CDKAL1. shRNA-mediated knockdown of CDKAL1 had no effect on proliferation. Knockdown of E2F3a or E2F3b alone induced antiproliferative effects, with the most significant effect on proliferation being observed when both isoforms were knocked down together. As E2Fs interact with the Rb tumour suppressor protein, Rb expression was analysed. There was a striking relationship between 6p22.3 amplification, E2F3 overexpression and lack of Rb expression. This was also examined in primary bladder tumours. Array-CGH detected 6p22.3 amplification in 8/91 invasive tumours. Five were studied in more detail. Four showed 13q14.2 loss (including RB1) and expressed no Rb protein. In the fifth, 13q was unaltered but the CDKN2A locus was deleted. This tumour was negative for p16 and positive for Rb protein. As p16 is a negative regulator of the Rb pathway, its loss represents an alternative mechanism for inactivation. Indeed, a phospho-specific Rb antibody showed much Rb protein in a hyperphosphorylated (inactive) form. We conclude that inactivation of the Rb pathway is required in addition to E2F3 overexpression in this subset of bladder tumours."

It is involved in translation of the yeast mitochondrial COX1 gene, which encodes subunit I of the cytochrome c oxidase. Pet309 is also involved in stabilization of the COX1 mRNA. Mutations in a similar human protein, Lrp130, are associated with Leigh syndrome, where cytochrome c oxidase activity is affected. The sequence of Pet309 reveals the presence of at least seven pentatricopeptide repeats (PPRs) located in tandem in the central portion of the protein.

In a series of in vivo analyses we constructed a pet309 mutant lacking the PPR motifs. Although the stability of the COX1 mRNA was not affected, synthesis of Cox1 was abolished. The deletion of one PPR motif at a time showed that all the PPR motifs are required for COX1 mRNA translation and respiratory growth. Mutations of basic residues in PPR3 caused reduced respiratory growth. According to a molecular model, these residues are facing a central cavity that could be involved in mRNA-binding activity, forming a possible path for this molecule on Pet309.

The core of the enzyme is formed by subunits Cox1, Cox2, and Cox3, which are encoded in the mitochondrial DNA. Expression of the mitochondrial-encoded subunits is highly regulated by proteins involved in transcription, transcript stability and processing, translation, and assembly into the mitochondrial inner membrane (3Herrmann J.M.

Both genes seem to participate in mRNA processing and may have similar functions in mitochondria. Pet309 is a translational activator necessary for Cox1 synthesis. It specifically acts on the 5′-UTR of the COX1 mRNA to activate translation. In addition, it is required to stabilize the pre-COX1 transcript (11Manthey G.M. McEwen J.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4031-4043Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It has been observed that translational activators specific for the COX1, COX2, and COX3 mRNAs interact with each other and with the mitochondrial inner membrane (12Brown N.G. Costanzo M.C. Fox T.D.

These repeats belong to a protein family that is very large in plants, with at least 442 members in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, there are fewer examples of these proteins in fungi, animals, and protists (17Lurin C. Andres C. Aubourg S. Bellaoui M. Bitton F. Bruyere C. Caboche M. Debast C. Gualberto J. Hoffmann B.

Pet309 is the only yeast translational activator that has been found to contain PPR motifs. In general, PPR proteins are usually found to localize in mitochondria and chloroplasts.

There is no structural information about PPR proteins, but models based on the closely related TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat) proteins suggest that the tandem repeats of these domains form a solenoid-like structure with a hydrophilic cavity where the phosphate skeletons of RNA might interact (29Small I.D. Peeters N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 46-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the growing number of PPR proteins discovered and characterized to date, very little is understood about the specific role of the PPR motifs present in these proteins. Yeast Pet309 provides a useful model of a PPR protein to elucidate the mechanism of action of the PPR motifs. Pet309 is predicted to contain at least seven PPR motifs located in the central portion of the protein. To test the function of the repeats present in Pet309, a set of deletions of the PPR motifs was constructed and analyzed. A model of the Pet309 PPR region was generated, and site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on residues that are predicted to be necessary for mRNA binding. It was shown that all the seven PPR repeats present in Pet309 are necessary for COX1 mRNA translation, and that mutation of basic residues that could be facing the inner cavity of the PPR structure decrease Pet309 activity. Surprisingly, the COX1 mRNA levels were not affected by the PPR deletions, showing that the mRNA stability function of Pet309 is independent of the PPR domains.

In addition, the product was subcloned into the XbaI-XhoI sites of yeast expression vectors pRS416 (32Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.

Total cellular extracts were isolated from cells grown to mid-log phase on synthetic complete media without uracil, containing 2% raffinose (39Yaffe M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% gel (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). Western blots were probed with anti-HA-horseradish peroxidase (Roche Biochemicals), anti-Cox1 (Molecular probes), anti-citrate synthase, anti-Arg8p, anti-Yme1p (the three provided by T. D.

Secondary goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma or Bio-Rad) was detected with the ECL or ECL+ kits (GE Healthcare). Synthesis of Mitochondrial Proteins—Translation in isolated mitochondria in the presence of [35S]methionine was performed as described (41Westermann B. Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 429-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After translation, mitochondria were washed with 0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and the radiolabeled proteins were separated on a SDS-PAGE gel, blotted into protran nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed with a Typhoon 8600 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Northern Blot Analyses—Total RNA was prepared using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) from yeast cultures grown to late log phase on raffinose-synthetic complete media lacking uracil. RNA was blotted to Hybond XL membrane (GE Healthcare). Blots were probed sequentially with the radioactively labeled COX1 exon 4, COX2 and with the 15S rRNA gene (42Shen Z.H. Fox T.D.

Blots were analyzed with a Typhoon 8600 PhosphorImager and quantitated with ImageQuaNT 5.1 software. Modeling for the PPR Region in Pet309—A search using the TPRpred server (43Karpenahalli M.R. Lupas A.N. Soding J. BMC Bioinformatics. 2007; 8: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) against the whole Pet309 sequence revealed the presence of 11 putative PPR motifs located between residues 312 and 759. The six motifs with the lowest p value (∼1e-07-1e-06, which indicates 1 × 10-7 to 1 × 10-6) correspond to one segment of the protein comprising residues 347–560. Using this fragment of the sequence, the HHpred server (44Soding J. Biegert A. Lupas A.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 (web server issue): W244-W248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2654) Google Scholar) revealed an alignment with the six tandem TPRs of the crystal structure of PilF (45Kim K. Oh J.

Only five residue insertions of one residue each occur in the alignment, all at the level of the junctions between the repeats. The three-dimensional model of the PPR repeats was constructed using SWISSMODEL (46Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C.

Fig. 6 was created with PyMOL, and the electrostatic potentials were calculated with the program APBS (47Baker N.A. Sept D. Joseph S. Holst M.J. McCammon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The PPR Region of Pet309 Is Necessary for Respiratory Growth—A comparison of the Pet309 sequence against the TPRpred server reveals the presence of 11 PPR motifs in the central portion of the protein. To understand the role of the PPR domain we created a deletion from residues 347 to 632 (pet309Δppr), which corresponds to the 7 most strongly predicted PPR motifs (having the lowest p values) (Fig. 1A). To facilitate detection of Pet309, the protein was tagged at its C terminus with three tandem copies of an HA epitope. The presence of the triple-epitope in wild-type Pet309 did not interfere with the respiratory growth of cells as judged by the ability of PET309-HA to fully complement the pet- phenotype of a pet309Δ::LEU2 mutant. Both the wild-type PET309-HA and the pet309Δppr-HA genes were cloned in the vectors pRS416 and YEp352 to allow expression in yeast in low copy or multiple copy plasmids, respectively. The plasmids were transformed into a yeast pet309Δ::LEU2 mutant, and the respiratory growth of the resulting strains was examined (Fig. 1B). The wild-type PET309-HA supported normal growth on non-fermentable carbon sources, whereas the pet309Δppr-HA strain could not grow on a non-fermentable carbon source. A similar phenotype was observed in cells expressing the single copy or multiple copy expression plasmids, suggesting that overexpression of the mutant protein did not compensate for the absence of the PPR domain of Pet309. To investigate the basis of the non-respiratory phenotype of the pet309Δppr-HA strain we first looked to see if the mutant protein was localized in mitochondria. Mitochondrial and post-mitochondrial supernatant fractions were obtained from strains transformed with the low copy and high copy plasmids bearing the wild-type PET309-HA or the mutant pet309Δppr-HA genes (Fig. 2A). The protein Pet309 was specifically recognized by the anti-HA antibody as a 118-kDa band for the wild-type PET309-HA or 85-kDa band for the pet309Δppr-HA strain. These polypeptides were not detectable in mitochondria bearing the untagged PET309 gene or the empty plasmids (data not shown). Greater accumulation of the Pet309 polypeptides was observed under multiple copy expression. These polypeptides were not detectable in the post-mitochondrial supernatant fractions, indicating that the Pet309Δppr-HA protein co-purified with mitochondria. Next, we investigated whether the Pet309Δppr-HA protein was membrane-bound or soluble. Mitochondria from strains bearing the PET309-HA or the pet309Δppr-HA, low copy plasmids were sonicated and centrifuged. Both the wild-type Pet309-HA and the mutant Pet309Δppr-HA proteins were present in the membrane pellet (Fig. 2B) and absent from the soluble supernatant. Alkaline Na2CO3 extraction of the mitochondrial membranes solubilized the wild-type Pet309-HA and the Pet309Δppr-HA proteins (Fig. 2C), indicating that both behave as peripheral membrane proteins. To examine the submitochondrial location of the Pet309 proteins, purified mitochondria were converted to mitoplasts by osmotic shock treatment and were subjected to protease digestion. Both Pet309-HA and Pet309Δppr-HA proteins were protected from proteinase K treatment in mitochondria and in mitoplasts (Fig. 2D). This result indicates that both proteins are facing the matrix side of the inner membrane. These results are different from what was observed by Manthey (13Manthey G.M. Przybyla-Zawislak B.D. McEwen J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), who reported that Pet309-c-Myc was an integral inner membrane protein. However, in that work, a high copy plasmid was used to overexpress the Pet309-c-Myc protein. Overexpression of translational activators has been associated with problems in mitochondrial gene expression (48Tzschoppe K. Kohlwein S.D. Rodel G. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 49Fiori A. Perez-Martinez X. Fox T.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1689-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and could affect their interaction with the mitochondrial inner membrane. For this reason we analyzed the Pet309-HA proteins expressed from low copy plasmids. Taken together, these results indicate that the respiratory defect of pet309Δppr-HA mutants is not due to a mitochondrial mislocalization of the protein. The association of the mutant protein to the mitochondrial inner membrane and its submitochondrial localization were not altered by the absence of the PPR domains. These observations, together with the capacity of the mutated protein to stabilize the COX1 mRNA (see below) strongly suggest that the Pet309Δppr-HA protein is not misfolded. The PPR Motifs in Pet309 Are Required for Translation of the COX1 mRNA—Pet309 had been previously demonstrated to be necessary for the translation and stability of the COX1 mRNA (11Manthey G.M. McEwen J.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4031-4043Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We investigated the effect of the PPR domain deletion on expression of the COX1 gene. Western blot analysis of mitochondrial protein extracts showed no accumulation of the Cox1 protein in the pet309Δppr-HA mutant (Fig. 3A). The mutant did not accumulate Cox1 even in pet309Δppr-HA high copy expression. Interestingly, overexpression of the wild-type Pet309-HA led to a substantial decrease in the Cox1 accumulation (3.5-fold). This observation is in agreement with the idea that overexpression of translational activators can lead to defects on the biogenesis of their target genes (49Fiori A. Perez-Martinez X. Fox T.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1689-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Pet309 could lead to formation of inactive Pet309 aggregates that could affect accumulation of Cox1 (48Tzschoppe K. Kohlwein S.D. Rodel G. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of the pet309Δppr-HA mutation on COX1 translation, we first analyzed [35S]methionine-labeled proteins from mitochondria carrying the pet309Δppr-HA mutation in low copy or high copy expression plasmids (Fig. 3B). Labeling of Cox1 was reduced to undetectable levels by the pet309Δppr-HA mutation even in overexpression conditions. As expected, labeling of Cox1 in strains with the wild-type PET309-HA was normal, whereas a null mutation (pet309Δ) completely prevented Cox1 labeling. These results suggest that the PPR domain of Pet309 is necessary for the COX1 mRNA translation. To corroborate this, we created a pet309Δ::LEU2 strain in which the mitochondrial reporter gene ARG8m replaced the COX1 coding sequence (cox1Δ::ARG8m). The ARG8m product is a matrix-soluble protein involved in arginine biosynthesis (50Steele D.F. Butler C.A. Fox T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5253-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This reporter has been widely used to analyze translation of mitochondrial genes (49Fiori A. Perez-Martinez X. Fox T.D. Mol.

Translation of cox1Δ::ARG8m has been demonstrated to be dependent upon Pet309 (52Perez-Martinez X. Broadley S.A. Fox T.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5951-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In cells carrying the wild-type PET309-HA, the cox1Δ::ARG8m gene supported growth in Argmedium (Fig. 3C). In contrast, cells bearing the high copy or low copy (data not shown) pet309Δppr-HA gene required arginine to grow, confirming that the PPR domain present in Pet309 is necessary for the COX1 mRNA translation. The PPR Motifs in Pet309 Are Not Required for Stabilization of the COX1 mRNA—Pet309 is also involved in the COX1 mRNA stability, as null mutants show a reduced accumulation of the mature COX1 mRNA (11Manthey G.M. McEwen J.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4031-4043Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This effect is particularly strong when the COX1 gene has introns, but it is also observed with the intronless COX1 gene (11Manthey G.M. McEwen J.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4031-4043Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We analyzed whether deletion of the PPR repeats present in Pet309 could affect the COX1 mRNA accumulation. Levels of the COX1 mRNA in cells bearing the intronless COX1 gene were analyzed by Northern blot and normalized to the mitochondrial 15S rRNA (Fig. 4). In wild-type cells expressing the high copy PET309-HA gene, the COX1 mRNA signal was increased 2-fold as compared with the low copy PET309-HA cells. A similar pattern was obtained for the pet309Δppr-HA cells. This effect was specific for COX1, because the COX2 mRNA levels were not affected in any sample. It has been suggested that high levels of translational activators could stabilize their target mRNAs (49Fiori A. Perez-Martinez X. Fox T.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1689-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This result indicates that Pet309 lacking the PPR repeats still has the capacity to stabilize the COX1 mRNA. In contrast, the null pet309 mutant showed a reduced accumulation of the COX1 mRNA as compared with the PET309-HA or the pet309Δppr-HA cells. We conclude that the PPR domains present in Pet309 are necessary for translation of the COX1 mRNA. However, the absence of these repeats does not affect the COX1 mRNA stability. Moreover, high expression of the pet309Δppr-HA protein caused accumulation of the COX1 mRNA, as observed for the wild-type Pet309-HA protein. Each One of the Seven PPR Repeats"

To examine the consequences of selenoprotein depletion on the oxidative environment of the cell, we generated a conditional knock-out mouse for the tRNASec gene (Trsp). Deletion of Trsp in either macrophages or liver elevated oxidative stress and activated the transcriptional induction of cytoprotective antioxidant and detoxification enzyme genes, including glutathione S-transferase P1 and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1, and other well known target genes of the transcription factor Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2). Simultaneous disruption of Trsp and Nrf2 severely compromised the cytoprotective response. Double knock-out macrophages displayed reduced viability, elevated oxidative stress, and increased susceptible to hydrogen peroxide treatment compared with deletion of either gene alone. Mice carrying a liver-specific deletion of Trsp on an Nrf2-null background experienced hepatocellular apoptosis and displayed a severely reduced survival rate compared with loss of Trsp alone. Our results thus demonstrate that reduced selenoprotein activity is counterbalanced by an Nrf2-mediated cytoprotective response, which is essential for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and viability.

Our results thus demonstrate that reduced selenoprotein activity is counterbalanced by an Nrf2-mediated cytoprotective response, which is essential for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and viability. Selenium is an essential micronutrient for the health and well being of all higher animals and many other forms of life. Deficiencies have been associated with increased incidences of infertility, cardiovascular disease, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, immune incompetence, and cancer (1Rayman M.P. Lancet. 2000; 356: 233-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3127) Google Scholar). Many of the protective properties associated with selenium may be attributed to the activities of the selenoproteins (2Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3565-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). These enzymes (numbering 25 in humans) contain selenium in the form of selenocysteine, an amino acid that is essential for their catalytic activity (3Kryukov G.V. Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Zehtab O. Guigo R. Gladyshev V.N. Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google Scholar). The ribosomal incorporation of selenocysteine relies upon a number of cis- and trans-acting factors unique to this group of enzymes, including a specific selenocysteine tRNA molecule (tRNASec) (4Driscoll D.M. Copeland P.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2003; 23: 17-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar).Genetic targeting of the tRNASec gene (Trsp) in mice has shown that selenoproteins are necessary in embryonic development and for liver function because loss of Trsp in whole animals is lethal at embryonic day 4.5 (5Bösl M.R.

A. 1997; 94: 5531-5534Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and specific removal from liver leads to death between 1 and 3 months of age (6Carlson B.A. Novoselov S.V. Kumaraswamy E. Lee B.J. Anver M.R. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8011-8017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Cells in culture also display an absolute requirement for selenium and can neither grow nor survive in its absence (7McKeehan W.L. Hamilton W.G. Ham R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2023-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cells grown under selenium-free conditions may be viably maintained by the addition of the lipid-soluble antioxidant α-tocopherol, or other vitamin E-related analogs, to the medium (8Saito Y. Yoshida Y. Akazawa T. Takahashi K. Niki E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39428-39434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). This suggests that at least one major functional role of the selenoproteins is to help maintain the redox status of the cell. Member proteins known to perform such a function include glutathione peroxidase (GPx) 4The abbreviations used are: GPxglutathione peroxidaseGSTglutathione S-transferaseNQO1NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1HO-1heme oxygenase 1AREantioxidant-responsive elementESembryonic stemROSreactive oxygen speciesH2DCFDA2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetateTUNELterminal nucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end labelingRTreverse transcriptionGCLCglutamate-cysteine ligase; catalytic subunitFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterLysMlysozyme MAlbalbumin. 4The abbreviations used are: GPxglutathione peroxidaseGSTglutathione S-transferaseNQO1NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1HO-1heme oxygenase 1AREantioxidant-responsive elementESembryonic stemROSreactive oxygen speciesH2DCFDA2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetateTUNELterminal nucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end labelingRTreverse transcriptionGCLCglutamate-cysteine ligase; catalytic subunitFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterLysMlysozyme MAlbalbumin. enzymes; selenoproteins P and W, which are capable of reducing hydrogen and lipid peroxides (9Behne D.

Similarly, mice that harbor a liver-specific deletion of the Trsp gene were shown to have increased expression of a GST Mu class member (6Carlson B.A. Novoselov S.V. Kumaraswamy E. Lee B.J.

It is proposed that the induction of cytoprotective enzymes is an attempt to re-establish the normal redox environment of the cell and to protect against the harmful metabolites that arise from oxidative damage.Understanding this cytoprotective response has particular relevance to human health because of the widespread usage of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, collectively referred to as “statins.” In addition to functioning as anti-cholesterol agents, statin drugs directly inhibit selenoprotein production by blocking isopentenyl pyrophosphate formation and, as a consequence, the isopentenylation of tRNASec at position 37, a necessary base modification for efficient translation of the selenocysteine codon (17Moosmann B. Behl C. Lancet. 2004; 363: 892-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 18Warner G.J. Berry M.J. Moustafa M.E. Carlson B.A. Hatfield D.L. Faust J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28110-28119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Statins are, in general, well tolerated by patients, but a sizable number of patients report muscle-related complaints, myopathies (19Thompson P.D. Clarkson P. Karas R.H. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2003; 289: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar), the majority of which are associated with elevated levels of 8-epi-prostaglandin 2α, a biomarker of membrane oxidative stress (17Moosmann B.

Ther. 2001; 26: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Numerous reports have documented the induction of cytoprotective enzymes, such as GST and NQO1, in response to oxidative stress or chemical insults (21McWalter G.K. Higgins L.G. McLellan L.I. Henderson C.J. Song L. Thornalley P.J. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Hayes J.D. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 3499S-3506SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). The induction was shown to depend on a cis-acting DNA regulatory element known as the antioxidant (or electrophile)-responsive element (ARE) and its cognate transcription factor Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) (22Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3129) Google Scholar). Nrf2 is a member of the Cap`n'Collar family of bZIP (basic region/leucine zipper) transcription factors and is expressed abundantly in liver, intestine, lung, and kidney, where detoxification reactions routinely occur (22Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3129) Google Scholar). Nrf2 binds to the ARE by forming a heterodimeric complex with other bZIP transcription factors, such as those of the Maf family (23Katsuoka F. Motohashi H. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4483-4490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).In a previous study, we used a gene promoter-targeting strategy to down-regulate the expression of the Trsp gene in mouse (24Kelly V.P. Suzuki T. Nakajima O. Arai T. Tamai Y. Takahashi S. Nishimura S. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 9: 3658-3669Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Embryonic development of the mice was severely affected, and homozygous animals died in utero at embryonic day 7.5. Surprisingly, ARE-regulated cytoprotective enzymes failed to be induced, with the exception of HO-1. Consistent with this result, we found that Nrf2 was not expressed in embryonic day 7.5 mice, leading us to conclude that Nrf2 may play central roles in the induction of cytoprotective enzymes when selenoprotein production is compromised. To explore this possibility, in this study, we created a conditional knock-out mouse for the Trsp gene. Macrophage- and liver-specific gene deletion of Trsp and Nrf2, singularly and in combination, allowed us to define Nrf2 as an essential mediator of cytoprotective gene induction and as a key protectant against oxidative damage when selenoprotein production is inhibited.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of the Targeting Vector and Embryonic Stem Cell Screening—The backbone of the conditional targeting vector (see Fig. 1A) consisted of a SalI-PuvII fragment (7931 bp) retrieved from a 129/Sv genomic library as described previously (5Bösl M.R. Takadu K. Oshima M. Nishimura S. Taketo M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5531-5534Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). A single loxP element was cloned into the SnaBI site positioned upstream of the tRNASec promoter elements, and a floxed pMC/neomycin-pMC/thymidine kinase (positive negative selection) cassette was inserted into the HpaI site immediately downstream of the tRNASec transcription unit. Finally, a diphtheria toxin (DT3) cassette was placed downstream of the long-arm homology region. The targeting vector was linearized with PacI for electroporation into embryonic stem (ES) cells. Candidate homologous recombinant clones were screened by PCR using the KDFP1 and KDRP1 primer pair, followed by Southern blot hybridization using a 285-bp SwaI-SspI short-arm internal probe as described previously (24Kelly V.P. Suzuki T. Nakajima O. Arai T. Tamai Y. Takahashi S. Nishimura S. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 9: 3658-3669Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To confirm correct homologous recombination of the targeting vector, Southern blot analysis was performed using the SwaI-SspI probe and a long-arm external PvuII-PvuI probe (1191 bp).Generation and Genotyping of Floxed Trsp Mice—Homologous recombinant ES cell clones carrying a floxed allele were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts and transferred to pseudopregnant females. The resulting high percentage chimeras (90% or greater based on coat color) were mated with wild-type C57BL/6 mice, and tail DNA samples from the F1 offspring were analyzed for germ line transmission. PCR genotyping of tail DNA samples was performed for 35 cycles (5 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 65 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C) using a mixture of three primers; the forward SeC1F primer (5′-GGC TGA CTT ACA GTT TCA GAG GCA C-3′) in conjunction with the reverse SeC1R primer (5′-ACC AAC TCC CCT TGA GTT TAG ACG C-3′) was used to identify the wild-type allele (439 bp) and targeted allele (494 bp), whereas SeC1F in combination with the reverse SeC2R primer (5′-GAC TGA GCC GGA GTG AAC AAA TGA AC-3′) was used to confirm the presence of the Trsp-null allele (465 bp).Deletion of the floxed Trsp gene in macrophages was performed by crossing heterozygous animals with a knock-in line of mice that have the cDNA for Cre recombinase inserted into the lysozyme M locus (25Clausen B.E. Burkhardt C. Reith W. Renkawitz R. Förster I. Transgenic Res. 1999; 8: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). The presence of Cre recombinase was determined using the CreF and CreR primers, whereas the neomycin phosphotransferase gene was detected using the Neo5-Prime and Neo3-Prime pair described previously (24Kelly V.P.

Biol. 2005; 9: 3658-3669Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Primer Extension Assay—Quantification of tRNASec and the 18 S ribosomal RNA molecules was performed by primer extension as described previously (24Kelly V.P.

The cells were transferred onto 6-well plates at a density of 7.5 × 105 cells/ml and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES, penicillin (10 units)/streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C.Cell Viability Assays—Cell viability after H2O2 treatment was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (27Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45566) Google Scholar). Briefly, macrophage cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml in a 6-well culture plate. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and changed to untreated medium (control) or medium containing 30 or 100 μm H2O2. After an overnight incubation, the cytotoxic effect of H2O2 was determined using a cell-counting assay kit (Dojin Laboratories), a modified version of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The absorbance of the medium was measured at 450 nm. Cell viability was determined from triplicate cultures and is expressed as the mean ± S.D.Measurement of Reactive Oxygen Species—Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured using the membrane-permeable fluorescent dye 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA; Molecular Probes). Macrophages were incubated with H2DCFDA at a final concentration of 5 μm in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at 37 °C, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and placed at 37 °C. After 30 min of incubation, the cells were washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline for flow cytometric analysis using a FACScan (BD Biosciences) set to excitation and emission wavelengths of 475 and 525 nm, respectively. For each analysis, 10,000 events were recorded.Apoptotic Assay—Cellular apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V and propidium iodide staining as described previously (28Engeland V.M. Ramaekers F.C. Schutte B. Reutelingsperger C.P. Cytometry. 1996; 24: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar).TUNEL Assay—Liver and lung tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h at 4 °C and embedded in OCT compound. Sections were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated TUNEL reaction mixture (TaKaRa) for 1 h at room temperature.Real-time Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR and RNA Blot Analyses—The RNA transcripts for GSTP1, GCLC, HO-1, and NQO1 were quantified by real-time RT-PCR. Briefly, total RNA was isolated from peritoneal macrophages using the ISOGEN method (Nippon Gene Co., Ltd.). cDNA was prepared using random hexamer primers, and real-time RT-PCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems 7700 sequence detector as described previously (23Katsuoka F. Motohashi H. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4483-4490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The primer sequences used are shown in Table 1. For RNA blot analysis, NQO1, GSTP1, and HO-1 probes were hybridized as described previously (22Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I.

Suzuki T. Nakajima O. Arai T. Tamai Y. Takahashi S. Nishimura S. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 9: 3658-3669Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts of peritoneal macrophages were prepared by sucrose gradient and probed with anti-Nrf2 antibody (29Suzuki T. Takagi Y. Osanai H. Li L. Takeuchi M. Katoh Y. Kobayashi M. Yamamoto M. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and anti-lamin B antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at dilutions of 1:2000 and 1:1000, respectively.RESULTSGeneration of the Trsp Conditional Knock-out Mice—To clarify how Nrf2 contributes to cellular protection against oxidative stress in the absence of selenoprotein production, we created a conditional knock-out mouse line for the Trsp gene. The conditional targeting vector was made using a SalI-PvuII fragment isolated from a 129/Sv genomic library, which encompasses the entire Trsp gene and an ∼5.9-kb pair downstream sequence (Fig. 1A). Following electroporation of the linearized construct and antibiotic selection of ES cells, three candidate clones were isolated, two of which had correctly recombined in the genome (Fig. 1, B and C).Heterozygous mutant mice with the conditional Trsp allele (Trspfl/+) were crossed with a transgenic mouse strain capable of ubiquitous expression of Cre recombinase under the control of the Ayu1 promoter (Ayu1-Cre) to yield Trspfl/+::Ayu1-Cre mice. Functionality of the loxP elements in vivo was demonstrated by generating heterozygous null mutant mice (Trsp+/del::Ayu1-Cre) and heterozygous mutant mice with the floxed and null alleles (Trspfl/del). We analyzed the recombination status of the Trsp allele in these mice by Southern blotting (Fig. 1D) and PCR (Fig. 1E). The results clearly showed that the loxP elements could faithfully direct the removal of the sandwiched region.Deletion of Trsp in Peritoneal Macrophages and Effect on tRNASec Production—We first examined tRNASec function in macrophages. Preliminary studies showed that adherent myelomonocytic cultures (derived from peritoneal exudates 4 days post-thioglycolate administration) almost exclusively contained fully differentiated macrophages, as determined by nonspecific esterase staining (data not shown). Cultures of exudates isolated earlier than this time point (days 1-3 post-thioglycolate administration) contained higher amounts of monocytic cells, in agreement with a previous report (30Fuhrman B. Shiner M. Volkova N. Aviram M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, all subsequent studies were performed on macrophage cultures that had been retrieved from mice 4 days after receiving thioglycolate.A mouse line with the cDNA for Cre recombinase inserted into the lysozyme M locus (LysM-Cre) has been described, allowing the removal of an appropriately floxed gene in myelomonocytic cell lineages (25Clausen B.E. Burkhardt C. Reith W. Renkawitz R. Förster I. Transgenic Res. 1999; 8: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). A deletion efficiency of 95% was reported for mature macrophages and an 83-98% deletion rate for granulocytes (25Clausen B.E. Burkhardt C. Reith W. Renkawitz R. Förster I. Transgenic Res. 1999; 8: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). PCR analysis was used to examine the recombination status of the Trsp locus in macrophages from wild-type, Trspfl/+::LysM-Cre, and Trspfl/del::LysM-Cre mice that had been maintained in culture for 1, 3, and 5 days (Fig. 2A). Cre recombinase expression from the lysozyme M locus is maximally induced upon maturation of myelomonocytic cells (31Faust N. Varas F. Kelly L.M. Heck S. Graf T. Blood. 2000; 96: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the same manner as the endogenous lysozyme M gene (32Cross M. Mangelsdorf I. Wedel A. Renkawitz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6232-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Following 1 day of culture, the floxed Trsp allele of Trspfl/+::LysM-Cre and Trspfl/del::LysM-Cre macrophages had almost fully recombined, resulting in heterozygous and homozygous null mutants of the Trsp locus, respectively. A marginal proportion of PCR product indicated the presence of residual floxed Trsp allele. It is not known if this fraction represents the PCR product from a contaminating population of non-myelomonocytic cells or the product of a fraction of macrophages that failed to undergo complete loxP recombination.FIGURE 2Deletion of Trsp in peritoneal macrophages and effect on tRNASec production. Peritoneal macrophages isolated from Trsp+/+, Trspfl/+::LysM-Cre, and Trspfl/del::LysM-Cre mice were cultured for 1, 3, or 5 days and analyzed by PCR to establish the recombination status of the Trsp locus (A) or by primer extension analysis to examine tRNASec levels (B, upper panel) relative the 18 S ribosomal subunit (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Primer extension analysis showed that the cellular levels of tRNASec reflected the genomic status of the Trsp allele (Fig. 2B). In wild-type macrophages, the levels of tRNASec did not change during the 5 days of culture (compare lanes 1, 4, and 7). Heterozygous cells had lower levels of tRNASec compared with wild-type cells (∼60%), which did not change over the 5-day period (compare lanes 2, 5, and 8). A small but observable quantity of tRNASec was detectable in macrophages from Trspfl/del::LysM-Cre mice that had been cultured for 1 day, but thereafter, levels became too low to detect (compare lanes 3, 6, and 9). The rapid decline observed in tRNASec levels is consistent with results from Chinese hamster ovary cells showing that the turnover of the tRNASec molecule is rapid relative to the total tRNA population, decreasing by 61% within 10 h of treatment with actinomycin D (33Jameson R.R. Carlson B.A. Butz M. Esser K. Hatfield D.L. Diamond A.M. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 1830-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Trspfl/del::LysM-Cre Macrophages Show a Parallel Decline in tRNASec and Selenoprotein GPx1—On the basis of studies in selenium-deficient animals, it was expected that Trsp deletion in myelomonocytic cells might interfere with the phagocytic function of neutrophils and macrophages (34Boyne R. Arthur J.R. Wilson A.B. J. Comp. Pathol. 1986; 96: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and the biosynthesis of leukotriene B4 by macrophages (35Gairola C. Tai H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We found that Trspfl/del mice carrying the LysM-Cre gene (thereby presumably null mutants in myelomonocytic lineages) displayed no obvious phenotypic abnormalities under pathogen-free conditions. Therefore, we carried out immunoblot analysis of whole cell extract from peritoneal macrophages for the GPx1 selenoprotein (Fig. 3A). In wild-type and Trspfl/+::LysM-Cre macrophages, the production of GPx1 protein was maintained over the 5 days in culture (compare lanes 1-4 with lanes 7-10 and 13-16). By contrast, in Trspfl/del::LysM-Cre macrophages, loss of tRNASec resulted in a gradual decrease in GPx1 over time, being almost undetectable by day 5 (compare lanes 5 and 6 with lanes 11 and 12 and lanes 17 and 18).FIGURE 3Effect of deleting Trsp on GPx1 levels, ROS production, and antioxidant enzyme gene transcription in primary macrophages. A and B, peritoneal macrophages from Trsp+/+, Trspfl/+::LysM-Cre, and Trspfl/del::LysM-Cre mice were cultured for 1, 3, or 5 days. GPx1 proteins levels were examined by Western blotting (A), or intracellular ROS levels were evaluated by FACS analysis using the redox-sensitive dye H2DCFDA (B). C, peritoneal macrophages isolated from Trsp+/+, Trspfl/+::LysM-Cre, and Trspfl/del::LysM-Cre mice were cultured for 1, 3, or 5 days, and total RNA was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR for the transcript levels of the antioxidant enzymes indicated. The 18 S ribosomal subunit was used as an internal standard.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Deletion of Trsp in Primary Peritoneal Macrophages Results in Increased Oxidative Stress and Induction of Antioxidant Enzymes—A major function for mammalian selenoproteins is their direct or indirect involvement in antioxidant defense pathways.

In the presence of reactive oxygen intermediates, H2DCFDA is converted to the fluorescent oxidation product 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein.

Telomerase RNA (TR) from different groups of species varies dramatically in sequence and size. We report here the bioinformatic identification, secondary structure comparison, and functional analysis of the smallest known vertebrate TRs from five teleost fishes. The teleost TRs (312-348 nucleotides) are significantly smaller than the cartilaginous fish TRs (478-559 nucleotides) and tetrapod TRs. This remarkable length reduction of teleost fish TRs correlates positively with the genome size, reflecting an unusual structural plasticity of TR during evolution. The teleost TR consists of a compact three-domain structure, lacking most of the sequences in regions that are variable in other vertebrate TR structures. The medaka and fugu TRs, when assembled with their telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) protein counterparts, reconstituted active and processive telomerase enzymes. Titration analysis of individual RNA domains suggests that the efficient assembly of the telomerase complex is influenced more by the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) binding of the CR4-CR5 domain than the pseudoknot domain of TR. The remarkably small teleost fish TR further expands our understanding about the evolutionary divergence of vertebrate TR.

Telomeres are specialized DNA-protein complexes that cap chromosome ends and are important for genome stability and cellular proliferation (1Ferreira M.G. Miller K.M. Cooper J.P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 7-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Telomeres consist of repetitive DNA sequences and a variety of telomere-associated proteins. The length of telomeric DNA in most eukaryotes is maintained by telomerase, a specialized reverse transcriptase that synthesizes telomeric DNA repeats at chromosome ends to counterbalance the natural shortening that occurs during DNA replication.

To date, TR sequences have been identified in 28 ciliates, 14 yeasts, and 38 vertebrates. Due to the lack of sequence similarity between groups of species, the TR secondary structures were determined independently for each of these three groups (2Chen J-L. Greider C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14683-14684Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The vertebrate TR secondary structure is composed of three highly conserved structural domains: the pseudoknot/template domain, the CR4-CR5 domain, and the scaRNA domain (3Jady B.E. Bertrand E. Kiss T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 4Chen J-L. Blasco M.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 2000; 100: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 5Chen J-L. Greider C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The pseudoknot/template domain contains a template region for telomeric DNA synthesis, and a conserved pseudoknot structure essential for telomerase activity. The CR4-CR5 domain together with the pseudoknot/template domain are both required for reconstituting active telomerase in vitro (6Tesmer V.M. Ford L.P. Holt S.E. Frank B.C. Yi X. Aisner D.L. Ouellette M. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6207-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, their mechanistic roles are unclear. The scaRNA domain is crucial for the 3′-end processing of TR and telomerase RNP biogenesis in vivo (3Jady B.E. Bertrand E. Kiss T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 7Mitchell J.R. Cheng J. Collins K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Whereas TRs from 34 tetrapods and 4 cartilaginous fishes share this three-domain structure (4Chen J-L. Blasco M.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 2000; 100: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), they have not yet been identified from teleost fish that comprises near half of the extant vertebrate species.Teleost fish is the most diverse group among vertebrates (8Nelson J.S. Fishes of the World. 4th Ed. Wiley, New York2006Google Scholar), and is distinct from the cartilaginous fish. The teleost and tetrapods (including amphibian, reptile, birds, and mammals) diverged from each other around 450 million years ago. Since then, teleost fish have undergone genome duplication and rediploidization, resulting in an amazing level of genomic diversity. The relatively faster evolution rate and the consequent diversity in teleost fish offer an attractive model for evolutionary studies. Identification of TR from teleost fish using degenerate PCR or BLAST search has, however, not been successful due to a high degree of sequence variation in TR.Here we report the identification of TRs from five teleost fish, Danio rerio, Oryzias latipes, Gasterosteus aculeatus, Takifugu rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis, using a novel bioinformatics method. To structurally and functionally characterize the teleost TR, we have cloned TR as well as TERT protein genes from medaka, fugufish, and zebrafish, and reconstituted telomerase activity for medaka and fugufish. The structural and functional analyses of the teleost fish telomerase enzyme provide important new insights into the evolution of the vertebrate telomerase RNP.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBioinformatics Search of Teleost Fish TR Sequences—A sequence search was performed using fragrep2. The input pattern, shown in supplemental Fig. S1, consists of eight position-specific weight matrices (PWMs). The quality of match between a PWM and a DNA sequence is measured as a fraction of similarity above an unavoidable background (9Kel A.E. Gossling E. Reuter I. Cheremushkin E. Kel-Margoulis O.V. Wingender E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3576-3579Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). The computational approach and implementation details of fragrep2 are described in detail in Mosig et al. (10Mosig A. Chen J-L. Stadler P.F. Lect. Notes Comput. Sci. 2007; 4645: 335-345Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our search pattern was generated by annotating the eight conserved regions in the TR alignment published in Chen et al. (4Chen J-L. Blasco M.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 2000; 100: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), and converted to a fragrep2 search pattern using the aln2pattern tool and both fragrep2 and aln2pattern (available www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software). The initial search pattern (Fig. S1) resulted in a single plausible hit in the medaka genome (assembly MEDAKA1). A BLAST search using medaka sequence as query against other teleost fish genomes revealed homologs in the stickleback (assembly BROAD S1), fugu (assembly FUGU 4.0), and tetraodon (assembly TETRAODON 7). Based on the four teleost TR sequences, a modified and less stringent search pattern was generated, with which we found 79 candidate sequences in the zebrafish genome (assembly Zv6). These were screened using INFERNAL (11Eddy S.R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2006; 71: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and the secondary structure annotated TR alignment from the Rfam data base (12Griffiths-Jones S. Bateman A. Marshall M. Khanna A. Eddy S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 439-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar), resulting in a single sequence that fit well with other teleost candidates and the previously known vertebrate TR sequences. The alignment of all 43 known vertebrate TR sequences can be obtained from the Telomerase Data base (telomerase.asu.edu).Genomic DNA and Total RNA Isolation—For isolation of genomic DNA and total RNA, medaka fish (O. latipes) were purchased from Aquatic Eco-Systems (Apopka, FL), and Zebrafish (D. rerio) were obtained from Dr. Yung Chang (Arizona State University, AZ) or purchased from Aquatical Tropicals, Inc. (Plant City, FL). Green spotted pufferfish (T. nigroviridis) were purchased from AquariumFish.net. Liver tissue of fugu (T. rubripes) fish was obtained from Dr. Shugo Watabe (University of Tokyo, Japan).Genomic DNA was isolated from 50 to 100 mg of fish tissue using the DNAzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instruction. Stickleback (G. aculeatus) genomic DNA was a generous gift from Dr. David Kingsley (Stanford University). Total RNA was isolated from 100 to 200 mg of gill or liver tissues using 1 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Concentrations of DNA and RNA samples were determined by A260 measurement using the Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nano-Drop Technologies).Sequencing and Cloning of TR Genes—To verify the sequences, teleost fish TR genes were PCR amplified from genomic DNA and the PCR products were sequenced directly. The verified sequences of five teleost fish TR genes were deposited into GenBank™ with the following accession numbers: EF569636 (D. rerio), EF569637 (O. latipes), EF569638 (T. rubripes), EF680233 (T. nigroviridis), and EF680234 (G. aculeatus).For medaka, zebrafish, and fugu, the PCR products of TR genes were cloned into the EcoRV site of the pZero vector (Invitrogen) to generate pMedaka-TR, pZebrafish-TR, and pFugu-TR. Plasmids were sequenced to confirm sequence accuracy of the cloned TR genes.Identification and Cloning of Teleost Fish TERT Genes—To reconstitute telomerase activity, we cloned TERT genes from medaka, zebrafish, and fugu. The fugu TERT (AY861384) and medaka TERT (DQ248968) gene sequences have been previously identified and were available from GenBank (13Yap W.H. Yeoh E. Brenner S. Venkatesh B. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 353: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The zebrafish TERT gene was identified in this study via a BLAST search of the zebrafish genome data base using the fugu TERT protein sequence as query. The exact 5′- and 3′-ends of the full-length zebrafish TERT cDNA sequence were determined by the 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using a SMART-RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech). The cDNA sequence was determined by direct sequencing of the reverse transcriptase-PCR products. The sequence of zebrafish TERT gene has been deposited into GenBank with accession number EF202140.To clone the TERT genes, the coding sequences of medaka and zebrafish TERT genes were PCR amplified from the cDNA samples prepared from total RNA samples using Thermoscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and an oligo(dT)18 reverse primer. The fugu TERT cDNA was PCR amplified from a cDNA library obtained from Dr. Byrappa Venkatesh (Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore). The PCR products of the medaka, zebrafish, and fugu TERT cDNAs were cloned into the pCITE vector for in vitro synthesis of the recombinant TERT proteins.In Vitro Transcription of TR—RNA was prepared by T7 in vitro transcription using PCR DNA products as template as described previously (14Chen J-L. Greider C.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 304-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Chen J-L. Opperman K.K. Greider C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 592-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).Northern Blotting Analysis—Twenty micrograms of total RNA was resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea denaturing gel and electrotransferred to Hybond-XL membrane (Amersham Biosciences) at 0.5 A for 1 h. The membrane was UV cross-linked and prehybridized at 65 °C for 30 min in 20 ml of UltraHyb hybridization buffer (Ambion). Riboprobes with sequences complementary to the target RNA were generated by in vitro transcription from a PCR DNA template that contained the T7 promoter and labeled internally with [α-32P]UTP using a MaxiScript kit (Ambion). After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, 1 μl of RNase-free DNase I (2 units/μl) was added to the reaction, followed by a 20-min incubation at 37 °C to remove the DNA template. Riboprobes were then purified using microspin G-25 columns (GE Healthcare). The membrane was hybridized at 65 °C overnight in 20 ml of UltraHyb buffer with the riboprobe added to 1 × 106 cpm/ml. The hybridized membrane was washed twice in 20 ml of 1× SSC (3.0 m NaCl and 0.3 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.2% SDS for 10 min at 65 °C, and twice in 20 ml of 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C. The blot was analyzed using a phosphorimager, Bio-Rad FX Pro.In Vitro Reconstitution of Telomerase—Human, medaka, fugu, and zebrafish telomerases were reconstituted using the TnT (transcription and translation) Quick Coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Briefly, recombinant TERT protein was synthesized in 10 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate at 30 °C for 60 min following the manufacturer's instructions. To assemble the telomerase complex, in vitro synthesized TR was added to the TnT reaction of TERT synthesis, and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. For the titration experiments of individual RNA domains, the pseudoknot/template or CR4-CR5 RNA fragment was added to a saturated 3 μm, whereas the other RNA fragment was added to various concentrations as indicated.Conventional Telomerase Activity Assay—Enzymatic activity of in vitro reconstituted telomerase was analyzed using a direct primer extension assay. A 10-μl reaction was carried out with 3 μl of in vitro reconstituted telomerase sample in the presence of 1× PE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm spermidine), 1 mm dATP, 1 mm dGTP, 1 mm dTTP, and 2 pmol of 5′-32P-end labeled (TTAGGG)3 telomere primer at 30 °C for 2 h. The products were subjected to phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, followed by 10% denaturing PAGE. Gels were dried, and products were detected and analyzed using a Bio-Rad FX Pro Imager. For each reaction, activity was determined by measuring the total intensity of extended telomere substrate, correcting for background, and normalizing against unextended primer (loading control). Relative activities were obtained by dividing the activity of each reaction by that of the reaction with saturated concentration of RNA fragments. For the titration assay, the relative activities were plotted against concentrations of RNA fragment and the nonlinear regression curve fitting was carried out using the one-site binding (hyperbola) equation, Y = Bmax× X/(Kd + X) (Prism 5, Graphpad Software, Inc.).RESULTSA Novel Bioinformatics Approach to Identify TR Sequences—Despite significant efforts to clone TRs from a diverse array of vertebrate species, TR sequences have not been identified from teleost fish (4Chen J-L. Blasco M.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 2000; 100: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Computational searches for TR candidates using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) of the sequenced teleost fish genomes have been unsuccessful (data not shown). The inability to identify TR sequences in teleost fish using either degenerate PCR or BLAST presumably stems from the fact that vertebrate TRs are conserved only in eight relatively short regions (called Conserved Region 1-8, or CR1-CR8) that are interrupted by highly variable sequences with a large number of indels (4Chen J-L. Blasco M.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 2000; 100: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar).To identify TR sequences, we employed an improved homology search tool, fragrep2, to search teleost fish genomes. The original version of the fragrep program implements a specialized algorithm for homology search that considers gap-free sequence patterns separated by variable-length regions of nonaligned sequence (16Mosig A. Sameith K. Stadler P.F. Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics. 2006; 4: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This approach has been demonstrated to work well for genomewide searches of non-coding RNAs (16Mosig A. Sameith K. Stadler P.F. Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics. 2006; 4: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 17Backofen R. Bernhart S.H. Flamm C. Fried C. Fritzsch G. Hackermuller J. Hertel J. Hofacker I.L. Missal K. Mosig A. Prohaska S.J. Rose D. Stadler P.F. Tanzer A. Washietl S. Will S. J. Exp. Zool. Part B. 2007; 308: 1-25PubMed Google Scholar). However, it had not been successful in finding teleost fish TRs. This is because even the relatively well conserved blocks, i.e. CR1-CR8, contained too many variations to be well represented by a single consensus sequence. To circumvent this, in fragrep2, we have replaced consensus sequences by PWMs to search for matched DNA sequences (10Mosig A. Chen J-L. Stadler P.F. Lect. Notes Comput. Sci. 2007; 4645: 335-345Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As shown in supplemental Fig. S1, the initial search pattern contains a collection of PWMs as well as minimal and maximal distances between these PWM blocks.Using this new approach, we successfully found a TR candidate in the medaka genome. Homologs of this medaka sequence could then be readily found by means of BLAST in stickleback, fugu, and Tetraodon genomes. All four sequences are flanked upstream by an ADP-ribosylation factor and downstream by homologs of human LASP1 and/or PLXDC2 (Table S1). Based on the alignment of the four teleost fish sequences, we modified the search pattern and were able to retrieve a single convincing candidate from the zebrafish genome using fragrep2. Surprisingly, the genomic location of the zebrafish TR candidate is neither syntenic with that of the other teleost sequences nor with the human locus (Table S1). All five teleost TR genes were PCR amplified from genomic DNA samples and the PCR DNA products were sequenced directly to verify the sequences identified from the genome databases (see “Experimental Procedures”).Unique Transcription Elements of Fish TR Genes—Analysis of genomic sequences upstream of the fish TR-coding sequences revealed transcriptional elements typical of an RNA polymerase II promoter: a conserved TATA box-like and a CCAAT box element (Fig. S2). This suggests that, like other vertebrate TRs, teleost TRs are products of RNA polymerase II. Interestingly, a putative CRE-BP1/c-Jun binding element, located between the TATA and CCAAT boxes, is conserved in both teleost and cartilaginous fishes, and some amphibians (bullfrog and horned frog) (Fig. S2). This data suggest an evolutionary change in transcriptional regulation of the TR gene along the tetrapod lineage.The Compact Size of Teleost Fish TR—To confirm the presence of the identified teleost TR transcripts in cells, we performed Northern blotting analysis to detect the endogenous TRs. The medaka and zebrafish TRs were each detected as a single band on the Northern blot (Fig. 1A, lane 1). Based on the Northern result, the size of the endogenous medaka and zebrafish TRs are estimated to be slightly smaller than the in vitro transcribed RNA markers that are 317 and 322 nt, respectively (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1 and 2).To determine the actual size of the endogenous TR, we mapped the 5′-ends of medaka and zebrafish TRs by 5′-RACE. The results showed that the 5′-ends of both medaka and zebrafish TRs lie 14 nucleotides upstream of the template sequence. Assuming that the 3′-end of the fish TR is located, like other vertebrate TRs, 3 residues downstream of the box ACA motif, the medaka and zebrafish TRs are predicted to be 312 and 317 nt long, respectively, consistent with the sizes observed from the Northern analysis. Based on sequence alignment, the other three teleost TR homologs are predicted to be 348 (stickleback), 325 (fugu), and 328 nt (Tetraodon). This makes teleost TRs the smallest among all known vertebrates, as the size of previously known vertebrate TRs ranges from 382 to 559 nt (4Chen J-L. Blasco M.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 2000; 100: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar).Teleost fishes have notably small genomes, whereas the cartilaginous fishes have relatively large genomes (18Gregory T.R. Nicol J.A. Tamm H. Kullman B. Kullman K. Leitch I.J. Murray B.G. Kapraun D.F. Greilhuber J. Bennett M.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D332-D338Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, teleost fishes with smaller genomes have the smallest TRs, whereas cartilaginous fishes with larger genomes have the largest TRs (from 478 to 559 nt) among vertebrates. By plotting the TR size over the genome size, we found a positive correlation between the size variation of TR and the genome size with an R2 value of 0.5007 and a p value <0.0001 (Fig. 1B). This strong correlation suggests that the size variation of fish TR resulted from evolution of the fish genome.Secondary Structure of Teleost Fish TR—To determine whether these small teleost TRs share a similar secondary structure with other vertebrate TRs, we constructed secondary structure models for teleost fish TRs using phylogenetic comparative analysis. The primary sequences of the five teleost TRs identified were aligned manually as described previously (4Chen J-L. Blasco M.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 2000; 100: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The eight conserved regions CR1-CR8 found previously in 35 vertebrate TRs are largely conserved in the teleost TRs (Fig. 2). Because of their small size and the presence of the CR sequences, teleost fish TR sequences can be readily aligned without much ambiguity. The aligned sequences were analyzed for covariations to derive a conserved secondary structural model for the teleost TR (Fig. 3A). Homologous to the structures of other vertebrate TRs, the proposed teleost structure contains 11 helices (P1, P2a, P2b, P3, P4, P5, P6, P6.1, P7a, P7b, and P8) grouped into three separate structural domains: the pseudoknot/template domain, the CR4-CR5 domain, and the snoRNA domain (Fig. 3A). All helices, except for the P6.1 and P7a, were supported with at least one co-variation per helix. All five teleost TRs share a similar secondary structure with variation mostly in the hypervariable region between the P4 and P5 helices (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S3).FIGURE 2Sequence alignment of teleost fish TR. The alignment includes TR sequences from zebrafish (D. rerio), medaka (O. latipes), stickleback (G. aculeatus), fugu (T. rubripes), and tetraodon (T. nigroviridis). Residues that are 100 (red) or 80% (blue) conserved in non-teleost vertebrates TRs (Chen et al. (4Chen J-L. Blasco M.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 2000; 100: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar)) are shown below the alignment. The eight conserved regions (CRs) are indicated with red brackets. Black lines above the alignment indicate helices (P1-P8) in the secondary structures. Conserved motifs, i.e. the template, box H and box ACA, are indicated with red lines above the aligned sequences. Residues shaded in blue indicate conserved nucleotides that form Watson-Crick base pairings, whereas the ones shaded in green indicate nucleotides that co-vary and maintain base pairing. The residues shaded in yellow are located in the single-stranded regions and are universally conserved among the five teleost fishes. Dashes (-) denote alignment gaps. Every tenth nucleotide of the zebrafish sequence is marked with dots above the alignment. The size of each RNA is indicated at the end of the respective sequence.

It contains shorter linker sequences between the three conserved domains. The commonalities and differences of the vertebrate TR structures are discussed in detail below.Pseudoknot/Template Domain—The pseudoknot/template domain consists of a highly conserved pseudoknot structure, the template sequence, and the P1 helix that defines the boundary of the RNA template. The pseudoknot structure consists of the P2a-P2b and P3 helices that are universally present in vertebrate TRs (Fig. 3B). The mammalian pseudoknot, however, contains an additional helix P2a.1 that extends the P2a helix (Fig. 3B, human TR). This mammal-specific P2a.1 helix is essential for human telomerase activity and is possibly involved in binding to the TERT protein (19Ly H. Blackburn E.H. Parslow T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6849-6856Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In teleost TR, the P2a and P2b helices are separated by a conserved asymmetric (0/6) internal loop (Fig. 3A), whereas, in other groups of vertebrates, this internal loop contains a varying number of residues.The P3 helix, in tetrapods, is conserved as a 9-base pair helix with a single nucleotide bulge (Fig. 4A, tetrapods). The shark and ray P3 helix has the same length but with a 2-nucleotide bulge at a different position (Fig. 4A, sharks and rays). Medaka TR interestingly lacks any bulge in its P3 helix, whereas other teleost TRs have a 1-nucleotide bulge at the position identical to the sharks. Notably, the lack of a bulge in the medaka P3 helix seems to be compensated by extensions of the P3 helix and J2b/3 loop (Fig. 4A, medaka). The variation of the size and position of the bulge in the P3 helix suggests that it might not be a critical element for the function or structure of the pseudoknot structure. Deletion of the bulge in the human P3 helix results in a minor reduction of telomerase activity (20Comolli L.R. Smirnov I. Xu L. Blackburn E.H. James T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16998-17003Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 21Theimer C.A. Blois C.A. Feigon J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 671-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The real role of the P3 bulge has yet to be revealed. Based on an NMR solution structure, the pseudoknot of human TR forms a triple helix that involves 5 base triples and a base pair at the junction of P2b and P3 helices (21Theimer C.A. Blois C.A. Feigon J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 671-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The sequences that form the triple helix are absolutely conserved even in teleost TR, confirming its critical role in telomerase function (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the distal portion of the P3 helix and the J2b/3 are less conserved, and are slightly variable in length and seque"

Eventually tumours progress and in approximately 30% of patients this is associated with mutation of the androgen receptor. Several receptor variants associated with advanced disease show promiscuous activation by other hormones and anti-androgens. Such loss of specificity could promote receptor activation, hence tumour growth, in the absence of conventional ligands, explaining therapy failure. We aimed to elucidate mechanisms by which alternative ligands promote receptor activation. The three most commonly identified variants in tumours (with amino-acid substitutions H874Y, T877A and T877S) and wild-type receptor showed differences in co-activator recruitment dependent upon ligand and the interaction motif utilized. Co-expression and knockdown of co-activators that bind via leucine or phenylalanine motifs, combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR, revealed these preferences extend to co-activator recruitment in vivo and affect receptor activity at the transcriptional level, with subsequent effects on target gene regulation. The findings suggest that mutant receptors, activated by alternative ligands, drive growth via different mechanisms to androgen-activated wild-type receptor. Tumours may hence behave differently dependent upon any androgen receptor mutation present and what ligand is driving growth, as distinct subsets of genes may be regulated."

The E-ring is formed by two structurally unrelated Mg-protoporphyrin IX monomethylester (MPE) cyclase systems, oxygen-dependent (AcsF), and oxygen-independent (BchE) systems, which involve incorporation of an oxygen atom from molecular oxygen and water into the C-131 position of MPE, respectively.

Chlorophylls (Chls) 2The abbreviations used are: ChlchlorophyllMPEmagnesium protoporpyrin IX monomethylesterPchlideprotochlorophyllide. are a group of tetrapyrrole pigments involved in light reactions of photosynthesis. The isocyclic ring, E-ring, is a unique feature of all types of Chls, which distinguishes Chls from other tetrapyrroles such as hemes and vitamin B12. The E-ring is formed by an oxidative cyclization of C-13 methyl propionate of Mg-protoporphyrin IX monomethylester (MPE) to form 3,8-divinyl protochlorophyllide (Pchlide). The E-ring formation causes a 30-nm blue-shift of the Qy band of MPE (1Bollivar D.W. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M. Guilard R. Porphyrin Handbook. 13. Elsevier, New York2003: 49-69Google Scholar) resulting in a dramatic color change from pink to green. The E-ring formation reaction involves a 6-electron oxidation of C-13 methylpropionate with incorporation of an oxygen atom to form oxo-group at C-131 position (1Bollivar D.W. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M.

The acsF gene encoding a protein with a monooxygenase motif has been found to be involved in the oxygen-dependent E-ring formation (5Pinta V. Picaud M. Reiss-Husson F. Astier C. J.

Though current cyanobacteria are usually associated with aerobic environments, many strains thrive in environments with a variety of oxygen levels including anaerobic environments such as microbial mats, lake sediments, and soil (19Stal L. Moezelaar R. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 179-211Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 20Stal L.J. Whitton B.A. Potts M. The Ecology of Cyanobacteria: Their Diversity in Time and Space. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2000: 61-120Google Scholar). In addition, most cyanobacteria face a diurnal light and dark cycle, and then the oxygen level in natural environments undergoes dynamic changes from anaerobic to aerobic throughout the day. Given the two structurally unrelated E-ring formation systems; the oxygen-dependent AcsF and the oxygen-independent BchE systems, it is a reasonable inference that oxygen is a key environmental factor by which Chl biosynthesis is regulated at the step of E-ring formation. However, little information is available regarding which E-ring formation system operates and how it is regulated under oxygen-fluctuated environments in cyanobacteria. Here we report the identification of two acsF-like genes, chlAI and chlAII, in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. We found that ChlAI is the sole E-ring formation system under aerobic conditions and that the second isoform ChlAII operates together with ChlAI under oxygen-limited (micro-oxic) conditions in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Cyanobacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Synechocystis 6803) and its derivative strains used in this study were cultivated in BG-11 medium (21Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stainer R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) supplemented with 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.2 at 30 °C. For culture of the gene-disrupted mutant with a kanamycin-resistant cartridge, the above medium was supplemented with 15 μg ml-1 kanamycin sulfate. Liquid cultures were bubbled with 2% CO2 in air (for aerobic conditions) under continuous illumination provided from fluorescent lamps (∼70 μmol m-2 s-1; FRL40SW, Hitachi, Japan). For agar plate culture, BG-11 liquid media were solidified with 1.5% agar (BactoAgar, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD). For growth under microoxic conditions, liquid cultures were bubbled with 2% CO2/N2 that were prepared by mixing pure N2 (99.999%, Nagoya Nissan, Nagoya, Japan) and CO2 with an appropriate flow rate. For cultivation on agar plates, agar plates were incubated in an anaerobic jar (BBL GasPak anaerobic systems; Becton, Dickinson and Company). Preparation of RNA and RT-PCR—Wild-type cells of Synechocystis 6803 grown under aerobic and micro-oxic conditions for 3 days were inoculated into fresh BG-11 media (50 ml) and cultivated under the same conditions for 3 days. Cells (OD730 = ∼0.7) were harvested by centrifugation at 2 °C, and cell pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen after complete removal of culture media. Total RNA was prepared essentially as described (22Aiba H. Adhya S. de Combrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11905-11910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Frozen cells were suspended in 600 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl; pH8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS) and mixed with phenol. After vigorous shaking, the mixture was incubated at 65 °C for 10 min with shaking at 2-min intervals. The supernatant was mixed with the same volume of phenol-chloroform (23Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). The phenol-chloroform extraction was repeated five times, the nucleic acids were precipitated by ethanol. DNA in the nucleic acid fraction was digested with DNase I (0.1 units μl-1; RNase-free grade, Takara, Ohtsu, Japan) in the presence of RNase inhibitor (0.8 units μl-1; porcine liver; Takara) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. RNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. RNA concentration was determined by absorbance at 260 nm (23Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). The isolated total RNA (2.5 μg) was used for the synthesis of cDNA with Superscript II (10 units μl-1; Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) and random primers according to the manufacturer's manual. After incubation at 25 °C for 10 min, at 42 °C for 50 min, and at 70 °C for 15 min, RNA was degraded by alkali treatment (0.23 n NaOH) followed by neutralization with HCl. Thus obtained cDNA fraction was used in 1:32-dilution as the template for PCR amplification with the specific primers (Supplemental Table S1). Construction of Plasmids for Gene Disruption and Transformation of Synechocystis 6803—Plasmids for gene disruption were constructed by overlap extension PCR (Supplemental Table S1; Ref. 23Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). DNA fragments of the upstream (f1 and r1 primers) and downstream (f2 and r2 primers) regions of the target gene were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of Synechocystis 6803 with a standard thermal cycle (KODplus DNA polymerase; Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). A kanamycin-resistant cartridge (neo) for gene disruption was also amplified with f3 and r3 primers (Supplemental Table S1) from pMC19 (24Fujita Y. Takahashi Y. Chuganji M. Matsubara H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1992; 33: 81-92Google Scholar) as the template. A chimeric DNA fragment consisting of the upstream region of the target gene, neo and the downstream region of the target gene were amplified by overlap extension PCR and cloned into pUC118. Synechocystis 6803 was transformed with the plasmid constructed as above and the kanamycin-resistant colonies were segregated to isolate homozygous mutants (25Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (856) Google Scholar). For the isolation of sll1214-disrupted mutant (Δsll1214), the kanamycin-resistant colonies that appeared on the first selective agar plates were picked up and cultivated under micro-oxic conditions. Complete replacement of the wild-type copy with the disrupted copy was examined by “colony PCR” (26Howitt C.A. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 32-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Pigment Extraction and Spectroscopic Analysis—Pigments were extracted from cells grown under aerobic or micro-oxic conditions on agar plates for 10 days. Because Δsll1214 does not grow under aerobic conditions, it was grown under micro-oxic conditions for 3 days and incubated under aerobic conditions for 7 days to prepare the cells grown aerobically. Pigments were extracted in 90% methanol as described (24Fujita Y. Takahashi Y. Chuganji M. Matsubara H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1992; 33: 81-92Google Scholar). Chl biosynthetic intermediates without phytol were extracted by mixing the methanol extracts with a 3.5-volume of acetone and half volume of water, and phase-partitioned with a 15-volume of hexane. Fluorescence spectra of the lower acetone-methanol phase were recorded with excitation at 435 nm (model FP777w, Jasco, Hachioji, Japan). Preparation of MPE—MPE was prepared from culture medium of the R. capsulatus mutant DB575 (ΔbchE, 7) essentially as described for preparation of Pchlide (27Fujita Y. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23583-23588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). DB575 was grown in RCV-2/3 PY medium (80 ml in a 200-ml flask) containing 5 μg ml-1 kanamycin at 34 °C in the dark with slow shaking at 130 rpm. The culture medium was collected by centrifugation. MPE in the culture medium was extracted in one-third volume of diethyl ether. The contaminating water was removed as ice after chilling at -20 °C. The ether was then evaporated to dryness by a stream of nitrogen. The dried MPE was dissolved in Me2SO. LC/MS Analysis of Pigments—Cells grown on agar plates under aerobic (5 days) and micro-oxic (10 days) conditions were extracted with methanol. After washing with hexane, the lower methanol-phase was corrected and evaporated to almost dryness by a stream of nitrogen. The extract thus obtained was dissolved in a small amount of Me2SO for LC/MS analysis. The LC/MS was performed using a Shimadzu LCMS-2010EV system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an electrospray ionization probe as described previously (28Nomata J. Mizoguchi T. Tamiaki H. Fujita Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15021-15028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). HPLC was performed using reverse-phase chromatography under the following conditions: column, Inertsil ODS-P (3.0 × 150 mm, GL Sciences, Tokyo, Japan); eluent, methanol/acetonitrile: 150 mm ammonium acetate (pH 5.25) = 400:50:100 (v/v/v); flow rate, 1.0 ml min-1; and detection wavelength, 415 nm. The entire absorption spectra of MPE were also recorded, during elution, using a photodiode-array detector. Preparation of Total Extracts and Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were grown under aerobic and micro-oxic conditions until OD730 reached about 1.0. Harvested cells were disrupted by sonication as described (29Yamazaki S. Nomata J. Fujita Y. Plant Physiol. 2006; 142: 911-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Proteins in the total extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE (a 5–20% acrylamide gradient gel, e-Pagel, ATTO, Tokyo, Japan) and electro-transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was incubated with anti-CHL27 antiserum (Agrisera, Vännäs, Sweden) in a 1000 dilution, and then with goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad). The specific protein signals were visualized by chemiluminescent substrate (ECL Western blotting Analysis System, GE Healthcare) with a lumino-image analyzer (LAS-3000mini, Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Two acsF-like genes, sll1214 and sll1874, were found in the genome of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Synechocystis 6803) by a BLAST search with the amino acid sequences of AcsF from R. gelatinosus and CHL27 (AcsF-homolog) from A. thaliana, as pointed out previously (5Pinta V. Picaud M. Reiss-Husson F. Astier C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Sll1214 and Sll1874 showed 42 and 39% identity, respectively, to AcsF from R. gelatinosus, and 62 and 50% identity, respectively, to CHL27 from A. thaliana. They conserved the two copies of a motif, (D/E)X28–37DEXRH, which are involved in binding of a binuclear-iron cluster for various monooxygenases (Supplemental Fig. S1A, and Ref. 30Wallar B.J. Lipscomb J.D. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2625-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Sequence identity between Sll1214 and Sll1874 was 57%. Three bchE-like genes, slr0905, sll1242, and slr0309, were found in the genome by a BLAST search with the amino acid sequence of BchE from R. capsulatus. The amino acid sequences of Slr0905, Sll1242, and Slr0309 show 29, 21, and 26% identity, respectively, to BchE from R. capsulatus. BchE belongs to the radical SAM family, which uses an oxygen-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster and S-adenosylmethionine to catalyze diverse radical reactions such as biotin synthase (BioB), lipoate synthase (LipA), and coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (HemN; 31Layer G. Heinz D.W. Jahn D. Schubert W.D. Curr. Opn. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 32Wang S.C. Frey P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 101-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). They all conserve an Fe-S binding motif including three cysteine residues (CXXXCXXC), which is found in all three BchE-like proteins (Fig. S1B). Given the possible oxygen sensitivity of BchE (33Gough S.P. Petersen B.O. Duus J.Ø. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6908-6913Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), cyanobacterial BchE-like proteins may operate only under anaerobic conditions as in the case of HemN (34Xu K. Elliott T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3196-3206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or an oxygen-sensitive Pchlide reductase (29Yamazaki S. Nomata J. Fujita Y. Plant Physiol. 2006; 142: 911-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The transcript levels of the five genes in wild-type cells grown photoautotrophically under aerobic and anaerobic conditions were semiquantified by RT-PCR (Fig. 1B). The “anaerobic” condition in this work means that the gas phase to incubate cyanobacterial cells is anaerobic (2% CO2/N2; see “Experimental Procedures”). Because cyanobacterial cells still evolve oxygen by photosynthesis under this condition, the environments of the cells is more properly referred to as “micro-oxic.” PCR products derived from sll1214 and slr0905 mRNAs were detected almost equally in both cDNA preparations from aerobic and micro-oxic conditions. In contrast, PCR products from sll1874, sll1242, and slr0309 mRNAs in cells grown under micro-oxic conditions were much more abundant than those in aerobically grown cells (Fig. 1B). This result suggests that sll1874, sll1242, and slr0309 genes are induced under micro-oxic conditions while sll1214 and slr0905 are constitutively expressed. Two other genes, ho2 (sl1875) and hemN1 (sll1876), are present downstream of the sll1874 gene. The ho2 gene encodes heme oxygenase (HO) that catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of heme to form biliverdin IXα, the precursor for phycocyanobilin (35Zhang X. Migita C.T. Sato M. Sasahara M. Yoshida T. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1012-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the hemN1 gene encodes coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (CPO) that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of coproporphyrinogen III to form protoporphyrinogen IX in the biosynthetic pathway common to heme and Chl a. Thus, all of the contiguous three genes, sll1874-ho2-hemN1, are probably involved in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. To confirm whether ho2 and hemN1 are also induced under micro-oxic conditions as well as sll1874, we also examined the transcript levels of ho2 and hemN1. As expected, the expression pattern of the two genes was similar to that of sll1874. There is no obvious sequence for transcriptional termination between the intergenic regions of the three genes. The expression pattern, and the sequence features suggest that the three genes form a transcriptional unit that is induced under microoxic conditions. To identify which gene(s) encode MPE cyclase in Synechocystis 6803, we isolated five mutants lacking one of these genes (Fig. 1A). Four mutants lacking sll1874, slr0905, sll1242, and slr0309 were successfully isolated by the normal segregation procedure under aerobic conditions (Fig. 1C). However, kanamycin-resistant colonies isolated for sll1214-disruption under aerobic conditions were found to carry the wild-type copy accompanied with a small proportion of the mutant copy of sll1214 (Fig. 1C). However, the kanamycin-resistant colonies isolated under micro-oxic conditions contained no detectable wild-type copy (Fig. 1C). This suggests that sll1214 is a gene essential for growth under aerobic conditions but dispensable under micro-oxic conditions. Mutants lacking sll1214, sll1874, slr0905, sll1242, and slr0309 are called Δsll1214, Δsll1874, Δslr0905, Δsll1242, and Δslr0309, respectively, hereafter. All mutants except for Δsll1214 grew photosynthetically on an agar plate under aerobic conditions in the light (70 μmol m– s–1; Fig. 2A). The mutant Δsll1214 did not grow in this condition as expected from the segregation process. In contrast, all mutants including Δsll1214 grew photosynthetically on an agar plate under micro-oxic conditions at the same light intensity (Fig. 2B). Slight growth retardation was observed in the Δsll1874 mutant. The mutant Δsll1242 grew somewhat more slowly than the wild-type showing a yellow-green color under both aerobic and micro-oxic conditions. In liquid cultures, essentially the same result was obtained (Fig. 2, panels C and D) except for Δsll1242. The mutant Δsll1242 did not grow in liquid culture irrespective of aerobic and micro-oxic conditions. The slight growth retardation of Δsll1874 observed on the agar plate was not so evident in liquid culture (Fig. 2D). Chl contents of the five mutants grown on agar plates under aerobic and micro-oxic conditions were determined (Fig. 2, panels E and F). Because the Δsll1214 mutant did not grow under aerobic conditions, it was cultivated under the micro-oxic condition followed by aerobic cultivation. The Chl content of Δsll1214 under the aerobic cultivation was drastically reduced by 67%, while that of Δsll1214 under the micro-oxic condition was about 80% of that of the wild-type. It should be noted that the Chl content of Δsll1874 grown under the micro-oxic conditions was significantly reduced by about 20%. MPE is expected to accumulate anomalously in mutants lacking functional genes involved in MPE cyclase. To examine whether MPE is accumulated in the mutant cells, we extracted the pigments with methanol from cells grown on agar plates under aerobic and micro-oxic conditions, and recorded the fluorescence emission spectra of the lower phase after phase partitioning with n-hexane (Fig. 3). MPE shows a characteristic fluorescence emission peak at 595 nm by excitation at 435 nm (1Bollivar D.W. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M. Guilard R. Porphyrin Handbook. 13. Elsevier, New York2003: 49-69Google Scholar). Only the extract from Δsll1214 of the five mutants grown aerobically exhibited a 595-nm emission peak, suggesting the accumulation of MPE in the Δsll1214 cells under the aerobic condition (Fig. 3A). MPE accumulation was also detected in Δsll1214 and Δsll1874 mutant cells grown under the microoxic conditions (Fig. 3B). This anomalous accumulation of MPE in Δsll1214 and Δsll1874 grown under micro-oxic conditions suggested that Chl biosynthesis is limited at the step of MPE cyclization, resulting in reduced Chl contents (Fig. 2F). The aerobically grown Δsll1874 mutant cells did not accumulate MPE, which is consistent with the result of RT-PCR. The expression level of sll1874 under aerobic conditions is much lower than that under micro-oxic conditions (Fig. 1B). No significant accumulation of MPE was detected in any three bchE-mutants including Δsll1242 under any conditions examined as well as the wild-type cells. No significant MPE accumulation was detected in aerobically grown Δsll1242 cells even though the Chl content was reduced significantly (Fig. 2, E and F). Mg-protoporphyrin IX, the direct precursor of MPE, shows fluorescence spectra identical to MPE (1Bollivar D.W. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M. Guilard R. Porphyrin Handbook. 13. Elsevier, New York2003: 49-69Google Scholar). To confirm that the pigment accumulated in Δsll1214 and Δsll1874 is MPE not Mg-protoporphyrin IX, a series of LC/MS analysis was carried out (Fig. 4). The standard MPE sample isolated from the R. capsulatus mutant contained two MPE-like pigments eluted at 18.6 min and 25.5 min (Fig. 4A, trace 2, peaks a and b, respectively). Their absorption spectra were very similar but the Soret peaks of the 18.6-min and 25.5-min pigments were 410 nm and 415 nm, respectively (Fig. 4C, traces 1 and 2). The m/z values of the 18.6-min and 25.5-min pigments were 600.3 and 598.3 (Fig. 4D, traces 1 and 2), which matched the calculated molecular mass of 3-vinyl 8-ethyl MPE (calculated for 600.26) and 3,8-divinyl MPE (calculated for 598.24), respectively. Detection of an adduct with methanol (633.3 and 631.2) originating from the eluent supported the identification of the pigments. Thus, we concluded that the 18.6-min and 25.5-min pigments are 3-vinyl 8-ethyl MPE and 3,8-divinyl MPE, respectively. The Δsll1214 cells grown in the aerobic and micro-oxic conditions and the Δsll1874 cells grown in the micro-oxic condition accumulated commonly the 25.5-min pigment (Fig. 4A). The 25.5-min pigment accumulated in Δsll1214 and Δsll1874 commonly showed characteristic absorption spectra (Fig. 4C) and the m/z values 598.1 (Fig. 4D), indicating that the accumulated pigment in these cells is 3,8-divinyl MPE not Mg-protoporphyrin IX. It should be noted that MPE was not detected in any of the three bchE mutants, confirming the result of the fluorescence emission spectra (Fig. 3). These results suggested that none of the bchE-like genes are involved in the E-ring formation. To detect Sll1214 and Sll1874 proteins immunologically in cyanobacterial cells, we carried out immunoblot analysis using an antiserum against CHL27 protein from A. thaliana (Fig. 5). Total extracts of wild-type, Δsll1214 and Δsll1874 cells grown under aerobic and micro-oxic conditions (except for Δsll1214 grown aerobically) were prepared and probed with the antiserum. The cross-reacting polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 38 kDa was specifically detected in wild-type and Δsll1874 cells grown under both conditions. Since the 38-kDa polypeptide was not detected in Δsll1214 grown under the micro-oxic condition and the apparent molecular mass is in good agreement with the calculate"
https://openalex.org/W2061455801,"Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) mediate cell proliferation, differentiation and survival in immune responses, hematopoiesis, neurogenesis and other biological processes. For example, STAT3 has been reported to be constitutively activated in numerous cancer cells. To clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the STAT activation, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening and identified KAP1/TIF1β as a novel STAT-binding partner. KAP1 is a universal corepressor protein for the Kruppel-associated box zinc-finger protein superfamily of transcriptional repressors. We found endogenous KAP1 associated with endogenous STAT3 in vivo. Importantly, small-interfering RNA-mediated reduction of KAP1 expression enhanced interleukin (IL)-6-induced STAT3-dependent transcription and gene expression. Furthermore, reduction of KAP1 expression resulted in the marked accumulation of STAT3 phosphorylated on Ser727 in the nucleus, a modification that regulates its transcriptional activation. These results indicate that KAP1 may serve as a transcriptional regulator of the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2094560736,"The promotion and progression of prostate cancer (PCa) are associated with androgen receptor (AR) signalling. AR functions are modulated by a variety of co-factors amongst which we identified the nucleophosmin (NPM/B23), a member of the histone chaperone family. Here, we show that NPM is overexpressed in PCa compared to normal adjacent tissues. AR and NPM interact in vitro and in vivo, and NPM is critical for androgen-dependent transcriptional activation in LNCaP cells as an anti-NPM siRNA downregulates transcription of a transfected androgen response element (ARE)-containing reporter promoter as well as expression of the endogenous androgen responsive prostate-specific antigen (PSA) gene. By investigating the effect of NPM on AR, we have also observed that NPM enhances AR binding to an ARE in vitro in electrophoretic gel mobility-shift assay experiments. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies further demonstrated that both AR and NPM associate with AREs of the PSA gene in vivo. Altogether, our data suggest that the molecular histone chaperone NPM could regulate AR functions by promoting assembly of AR-containing regulatory complexes and that high levels of NPM might alter AR functions in PCa."
https://openalex.org/W2066528026,"By using seismic records of the 2004 magnitude 6.0 Parkfield earthquake, we identified a burst of high-frequency seismic radiation that occurred about 13 kilometers northwest of the hypocenter and 5 seconds after rupture initiation. We imaged this event in three dimensions by using a waveform back-projection method, as well as by timing distinct arrivals visible on many of the seismograms. The high-frequency event is located near the south edge of a large slip patch seen in most seismic and geodetic inversions, indicating that slip may have grown abruptly at this point. The time history obtained from full-waveform back projection suggests a rupture velocity of 2.5 kilometers per second. Energy estimates for the subevent, together with long-period slip inversions, indicate a lower average stress drop for the northern part of the Parkfield earthquake compared with that for the region near its hypocenter, which is in agreement with stress-drop estimates obtained from small-magnitude aftershocks."

https://openalex.org/W1978668789,"Eg5/KSP is the kinesin-related motor protein that generates the major plus-end directed force for mitotic spindle assembly and dynamics. Recent work using a dimeric form of Eg5 has found it to be a processive motor; however, its mechanochemical cycle is different from that of conventional Kinesin-1. Dimeric Eg5 appears to undergo a conformational change shortly after collision with the microtubule that primes the motor for its characteristically short processive runs. To better understand this conformational change as well as head-head communication during processive stepping, equilibrium and transient kinetic approaches have been used. By contrast to the mechanism of Kinesin-1, microtubule association triggers ADP release from both motor domains of Eg5. One motor domain releases ADP rapidly, whereas ADP release from the other occurs after a slow conformational change at approximately 1 s(-1). Therefore, dimeric Eg5 begins its processive run with both motor domains associated with the microtubule and in the nucleotide-free state. During processive stepping however, ATP binding and potentially ATP hydrolysis signals rearward head advancement 16 nm forward to the next microtubule-binding site. This alternating cycle of processive stepping is proposed to terminate after a few steps because the head-head communication does not sufficiently control the timing to prevent both motor domains from entering the ADP-bound state simultaneously."
https://openalex.org/W1972322040,"Autoinhibition plays a key role in the control of protein kinase activity. ErbB2 is a unique receptor-tyrosine kinase that does not bind ligand but possesses an extracellular domain poised to engage other ErbBs. Little is known about the molecular mechanism for ErbB2 catalytic regulation. Here we show that ErbB2 kinase is strongly autoinhibited, and a loop connecting the αC helix and β4 sheet within the kinase domain plays a major role in the control of kinase activity. Mutations of two Gly residues at positions 776 and 778 in this loop dramatically increase ErbB2 catalytic activity. Kinetic analysis demonstrates that mutational activation is due to ∼10- and ∼7-fold increases in ATP binding affinity and turnover number, respectively. Expression of the activated ErbB2 mutants in cells resulted in elevated ligand-independent ErbB2 autophosphorylation, ErbB3 phosphorylation, and stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. Molecular modeling suggests that the ErbB2 kinase domain is stabilized in an inactive state via a hydrophobic interaction between the αC-β4 and activation loops. Importantly, many ErbB2 human cancer mutations have been identified in the αC-β4 loop, including the activating G776S mutation studied here. Our findings reveal a new kinase regulatory mechanism in which the αC-β4 loop functions as an intramolecular switch that controls ErbB2 activity and suggests that loss of αC-β4 loop-mediated autoinhibition is involved in oncogenic activation of ErbB2.

The appropriate regulation of the catalytic activity of PTKs is crucial to many physiological processes, and abnormal kinase activation can have severe consequences leading to cell transformation and cancer (1Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3099) Google Scholar). In quiescent cells PTKs are maintained in an inactive state by a variety of autoinhibition mechanisms. Upon stimulation, the autoinhibition is relieved, leading to kinase activation. Several PTK activation mechanisms have been recognized, and a common PTK activation mechanism occurs via phosphorylation of tyrosine(s) in a segment referred to as the activation loop (2Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar, 3Schlessinger J.

ErbB receptors consist of an extracellular domain (ECD), a transmembrane helix, an intracellular PTK domain, and a carboxyl tail harboring tyrosine phosphorylation sites, which upon phosphorylation provide docking sites for signal transducers. ErbB receptors play important roles in the control of cell proliferation, migration, survival, and differentiation of target cells (4Citri A. Yarden Y. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Overexpression or dysregulation of ErbB receptor activity, especially EGFR and ErbB2, has been implicated in various human cancers (6Hynes N.E. Lane H.A. Nat. Rev.

Accordingly, these receptors have been intensely studied to understand their importance in cancer biology and as therapeutic targets. ErbB2 overexpression is observed in 20-30% of human breast cancers and is associated with a more aggressive course and a poor prognosis (8Slamon D.J. Godolphin W. Jones L.A. Holt J.A. Wong S.G.

A humanized anti-ErbB2 monoclonal antibody, Herceptin, has been approved for the clinical treatment of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer, and several small molecular ErbB2 kinase inhibitors are currently in development (6Hynes N.E.

Upon EGF or transforming growth factor α binding, the EGFR ECD undergoes a striking conformational change, leading to the exposure of the dimerization domain and receptor activation (9Garrett T.P.

Indeed, ErbB2 has been demonstrated to be the preferred partner for ligand activated EGFR, ErbB3, and ErbB4 (15Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E.

Mice that express only a kinase-inactive ErbB2 die at midgestation, suggesting that the catalytic activity of ErbB2 is absolutely required for embryonic development (17Chan R. Hardy W.R. Laing M.A. Hardy S.E. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, few studies have been focused on the enzymatic properties of ErbB2 kinase (18Guy P.M. Carraway K.L. II I Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13851-13856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Jan A.Y. Johnson E.F. Diamonti A.J. Carraway I.K. Anderson K.S.

The molecular mechanism by which the ErbB2 kinase activity is controlled and activated remains to be understood. In the present work we demonstrated that ErbB2 kinase is autoinhibited by a loop between the αC helix and β4 sheet in its kinase domain. Mutations in this loop can release the autoinhibition interaction that leads to ErbB2 kinase activation. Our steady-state kinetic investigation revealed that the mutations in the αC-β4 loop significantly increase the binding affinity for ATP and catalytic rate, and constitutive signaling was observed when these activated ErbB2s were expressed in cells. Our findings identify a new kinase regulation mechanism in which the αC-β4 loop functions as an intramolecular switch that regulates ErbB2 activity. Furthermore, because almost all ErbB2 kinase domain mutations in human cancers have been localized to the αC-β4 loop, it appears likely that loss of this αC-β4 loop-mediated autoinhibition is involved in oncogenic activation of ErbB2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Reagents—Antibodies (Abs) against MAPK and phosphotyrosine were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories, and Abs against ErbB2 and Myc were obtained from Neomarkers.

The identities of expression constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Cell Culture, Transfections, and Generation of Stable Cell Lines—32D cell lines expressing EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 were generated as described previously and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% medium conditioned by WEHI-3B cells (23Deb T.B.

To generate cells expressing wild type or mutant ErbB2 along with ErbB3, 32D-E3 cells, which express only ErbB3 (24Alimandi M. Wang L.M. Bottaro D. Lee C.C. Kuo A. Frankel M. Fedi P. Tang C.

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (BD Biosciences FACS-Star) of stable transfectants was performed with ErbB2 monoclonal Ab (Ab-2, Neomarker) and visualized using a fluorescent isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. Cos7 cells were cultured and transfected as previously described (25Deb T.B. Wong L. Salomon D.S. Zhou G. Dixon J.E. Gutkind J.S. Thompson S.A. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16643-16646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer.Purification of ErbBs—Myc/hexahistidine-tagged full-length human EGFR or ErbB2 were purified by Co2+-based immobilized metal affinity chromatography from stable 32D cell lines as described previously (21Fan Y.X. Wong L. Deb T.B. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38143-38150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding Myc/hexahistidine-tagged human EGFR-(681-1186) or ErbB2-(712-1255) were subcloned into pENTR/d-TOPO (Invitrogen), and baculoviruses were produced using the baculovirus expression system in Sf9 cells (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 3 days after infection by centrifugation at 4000 × g and extracted in 5 ml of lysis buffer/g of cell pellet (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm PMSF phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 5 mm imidazole) at 4 °C for 1 h. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was incubated with Ni2+-NTA resin (Qiagen) at 4 °C for 1 h. A 0.4-ml column volume (CV) of Ni2+-NTA resin was used per 1 liter of Sf9 culture. The Ni2+-NTA-bound proteins were washed in series with the following solutions: 3 × 5 CV of 5 mm imidazole in wash buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, at 4 °C, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Tween 20), 1 × 5 CV of wash buffer supplemented with 1 m KCl, 2 × 5 CV 15 mm imidazole in wash buffer. Recombinant proteins were then eluted with 3 CV of 100 mm imidazole in wash buffer. Protein was quantified by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE using bovine serum albumin as a standard.Kinase Assays—All ErbB kinase reactions were performed in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 50 μm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 μm ATP with 1.25 mCi/ml [γ32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), and 0.1 μm receptor kinases in a total volume of 40 μl at 25 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 8.5% H3PO4. Terminated reaction mixtures were transferred to P-30 Filtermats (Wallac) and washed 3× with 0.85% H3PO4 and 3× with water, and bound radioactivity was quantified with a Trilux Microbeta scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The steady-state kinetic parameters were determined conventionally for two-substrate enzymes by keeping one substrate constant at saturation level and varying the concentration of the other. Initial rates were determined from the linear range of the reaction (<5% substrate converted). Four replicates were measured in all experiments, and steady-state kinetic parameters, Km and kcat were calculated using the Enzyme Kinetic Module of Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific). The errors for kcat/Km were calculated with the formula, (kcat/Km)(S.E.1/kcat)2+(S.E.2/Km)2(Eq. 1) where S.E.1 and S.E.2 are standard error for kcat and Km, respectively.Structural Modeling and Analysis—Sequence alignment of ErbB2 and EGFR kinase domains was performed using ClustalX (26Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35206) Google Scholar) and manually adjusted to keep the overall secondary structures. The structure of ErbB2 was modeled and refined according to the crystal structure of EGFR (Protein Data Bank code 2GS7) using NEST in Jackal package (27Xiang Z. Soto C.S. Honig B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7432-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). PyMol was used for model display and figure generation.RESULTSErbB2 Kinase Has a Lower Constitutive Catalytic Activity Relative to EGFR—In an attempt to measure ErbB2 kinase activity in cancer cells, we surprisingly found that no significant in vitro kinase activity was detected in ErbB2 immunoprecipitants derived from T47D breast cancer cells, whereas EGFR and ErbB4 kinase activity was easily detected (data not shown). We tried numerous lysis and assay conditions (i.e. cell lines, detergents, antibodies, and substrates), but the measured ErbB2 kinase activity was always much lower than EGFR and ErbB4. Similar results have been reported by others (28Cohen B.D. Green J.M. Foy L. Fell H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4813-4818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To better understand the basis for the low ErbB2 catalytic activity, we generated human ErbB2 or EGFR constructs tagged with an Myc epitope and hexahistidine at the C terminus. The complete sequences of these cDNA constructs were confirmed, and the receptors were capable of ligand-dependent signaling when expressed in ErbB-null myeloid 32D cells as previously described (23Deb T.B. Su L. Wong L. Bonvini E. Wells A. David M. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15554-15560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These receptors were expressed in Cos7 cells and immunopurified by anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, whereas the protein levels in the immunoprecipitants were comparable as indicated by anti-Myc Western blotting, the autokinase activity of ErbB2 (lane 4) was very low relative to EGFR (lane 2). No significant phosphorylation was detected for kinase-inactive receptors EGFR K721M (lane 1) and ErbB2 K753M (lane 3). The catalytic activities of the immunopurified ErbB2 and EGFR were also examined using a synthetic peptide Gab1 Y627, which contains a sequence identical to 17 amino acids surrounding a major tyrosine phosphorylation site in Gab1 at position 627 (21Fan Y.X. Wong L. Deb T.B. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38143-38150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). ErbB2 kinase activity for Gab1 Y627 was ∼34-fold lower than that of EGFR (Fig. 1B). We also found that the activity of ErbB4 immunoprecipitated from Cos7 cells was very similar to EGFR but was much higher than ErbB2 (data not shown).To study whether the ECD or transmembrane region inhibits the catalytic activity of the ErbB2 kinase, we engineered chimeric receptors by reciprocally switching EGFR and ErbB2 kinase domains. The swapped kinase domains of EGFR and ErbB2 contain amino acids 686-953 and 718-985, respectively, and these chimeras were designated as EGFR/ErbB2-KD and ErbB2/EGFR-KD. As shown in Fig. 1A, EGFR/ErbB2-KD had a much lower autokinase activity than ErbB2/EGFR-KD (lane 5 and 6). The EGFR/ErbB2-KD activity toward Gab1 Y627 peptide was also ∼8-fold lower than ErbB2/EGFR-KD (Fig. 2B). We also generated truncated versions of the receptors, namely EGFR-(681-1186) and ErbB2-(712-1255), which lack the ECD and transmembrane region. Consistent with the full-length and chimeric receptor results, EGFR-(681-1186) possessed much higher autokinase and Gab1 peptide activities relative to ErbB2-(712-1255).FIGURE 2Mutations in ErbB2 kinase domain activate its catalytic activity. A, the full-length EGFR, WT, or mutant ErbB2s expressed in Cos7 cells were immunoprecipitated and subjected to kinase assay as in Fig. 1B. B, kinase activity of truncated versions of receptor kinases were measured as in A. C, truncated EGFR and ErbB2s expressed in Sf9 cells were purified and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. D, specific kinase activities of kinases purified from Sf9 cells were measured. Data represent the means ± S.E. of duplicate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To rule out the possibility that the observed low activity of ErbB2 is due to the Cos7 expression system or to the bound antibody in the immunoprecipitants, we purified soluble full-length EGFR or ErbB2 from stable 32D cell lines as previously described (21Fan Y.X. Wong L. Deb T.B. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38143-38150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Unlike EGFR in immunoprecipitants, soluble EGFR can be activated by EGF ∼5-fold upon 1 μm EGF stimulation in an in vitro kinase reaction, whereas as expected, the ErbB2 activity was not affected by EGF. Consistent with the results from immunoprecipitation experiments, the activity of the soluble ErbB2 preparation was also very low and was ∼7 and 1.4% of EGFR activities in the absence and presence of 1 μm EGF, respectively (Fig. 1C). The truncated versions of the receptors, ErbB2-(712-1255) and EGFR-(681-1186), were cloned into baculovirus and expressed in Sf9 cells. The proteins were purified using the Ni2+-NTA affinity method as described under “Experimental Procedures.” No significant protein impurities were detected in the purified ErbB kinases by either Coomassie Blue (See Fig. 2C) or silver staining (data not shown). Again, as shown in Fig. 1D, the ErbB2-(712-1255) kinase activity was ∼10-fold lower than its EGFR counterpart.To rule out that the activity difference between EGFR and ErbB2 is due to the assay conditions, we tested the ErbB2 kinase activities toward a number of peptide substrates, including a peptide whose sequence was optimized for ErbB2 using a degenerate peptide library (19Jan A.Y. Johnson E.F. Diamonti A.J. Carraway I.K. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9786-9803Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) in the presence of Mg2+, Mn2+, or both. Under all conditions tested, ErbB2 kinase activity was consistently a small fraction of that measured for the EGFR. Taken together, we hypothesized that relative to EGFR and ErbB4, ErbB2 is strongly autoinhibited and that a major mechanism for the autoinhibition appears to be localized within the kinase domain.Mutations in Kinase Domain Increase ErbB2 Catalytic Activity and Reveal Autoinhibition—To identify particular residues responsible for the low ErbB2 kinase activity, we aligned the ErbB2 kinase domain sequence with EGFR and ErbB4 (supplemental Fig. 1S). The sequence of ErbB2 kinase domain shares ∼83 and 77% identity with EGFR and ErbB4, respectively. In the same region, EGFR and ErbB4 share 79% identity. The residues conserved throughout all protein kinases are unaltered in ErbB2. However, some residues identical in EGFR and ErbB4 are altered in ErbB2. Taking into consideration that the orientation of αC helix is critical for the catalytic activity of all protein kinases (2Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar, 29Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we speculated that the altered residues in ErbB2 within the loop located between the αC helix and β4 sheet (designated αC-β4 loop) may play a negative regulatory role and render the ErbB2 kinase in a low activity or inactive state. In this loop, five of the eight residues in ErbB2 (Gly-776, Gly-778, Ser-779, Tyr-781, and Ser-783) differ from those in EGFR. We generated full-length and truncated mutant ErbB2s in which single or multiple residues were changed to their counterparts in EGFR. The mutant with all five changes was designated 5M, and the mutant containing S779N, Y781H, and S783C was termed 3M. As shown in Fig. 2A, G776S mutation increased the full-length ErbB2 kinase activity ∼3-fold, whereas G778D, G776S/G778D, and 5M produced more dramatic increases (∼10-11-fold). The activities of these 3 mutants reached up to 80% that of EGFR. In contrast, virtually no activation was observed for 3M. Very similar activations were found for ErbB2-(712-1255) carrying these mutations (Fig. 2B). The sequence alignment also revealed, in addition to the αC-β4 loop, considerable variations in the ErbB2 kinase domain that differ from EGFR and ErbB4. These differences include two continuous segments 813-817 (NRGRL) and 963-965 (SEC), located within the αd-αE and αH-αI loops, respectively, and a valine at 839 just before the catalytic loop and a threonine at 875 in the activation loop. However, changing these residues resulted in little or no increase in the ErbB2 kinase activity (Fig. 2B).Furthermore, we purified truncated versions of activated ErbB2 mutants from Sf9 cells and measured their kinase activities. The kinase activities of these purified kinases (Fig. 2D) were very similar to those achieved with the immunopurified proteins from Cos7 cells (Fig. 2B). These data demonstrate that the residues within the αC-β4 loop in the N-lobe of the ErbB2 kinase domain, and especially Gly-778, function to restrain ErbB2 kinase activity.Activation of ErbB2 by Mutation Is Not Due to Hsp90 Release—Previous studies have demonstrated that the ErbB2 αC-β4 loop is required for Hsp90 binding and geldanamycin (GA)-induced degradation of ErbB2. Mutations in this loop disrupt Hsp90 association and confer GA resistance (30Tikhomirov O. Carpenter G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 39-43PubMed Google Scholar, 31Xu W. Yuan X. Xiang Z. Mimnaugh E. Marcu M. Neckers L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 32Citri A. Gan J. Mosesson Y. Vereb G. Szollosi J. Yarden Y. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Hsp90 association directly inhibits ErbB2 kinase, we expressed EGFR or various versions of ErbB2 in Cos7 cells and treated the cells with 1 μm GA. Consistent with the published data (31Xu W. Yuan X. Xiang Z. Mimnaugh E. Marcu M. Neckers L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 32Citri A. Gan J. Mosesson Y. Vereb G. Szollosi J. Yarden Y. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we found that receptors containing the ErbB2 kinase domain bound Hsp90 (Fig. 3, lanes 4, 7, and 10), and GA treatment decreased the Hsp90 association (lanes 5, 8, and 11). Conversely, no Hsp90 binding to EGFR was detected (lanes 1-3). In an alternative approach, the immunocomplexes from untreated cell were treated with 1 μm GA in vitro. As shown in Fig. 3A (lanes 6, 9, and 12), ErbB2s and Hsp90 interaction was diminished by GA. Our results demonstrated that release of Hsp90 by either approach did not yield a significant increase in ErbB2 kinase activity (Fig. 3A, bar graph). We analyzed the immunocomplexes by SDS-PAGE and silver staining and found that only a small percentage (<5%) of ErbB2 in the immunocomplex had bound Hsp90 (data not shown). We also tested the effects of point mutations on the interaction of ErbB2 with Hsp90. As shown in Fig. 3B, all mutants had decreased ErbB2-Hsp90 interaction, consistent with previous work (31Xu W. Yuan X. Xiang Z. Mimnaugh E. Marcu M. Neckers L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, the activation induced by these mutations is unlikely due to the decrease in the Hsp90 binding because the ErbB2 mutants purified from Sf9 cells, in which no Hsp90 association was detected by silver staining, had similar activation profiles (Fig. 2, C and D). These results demonstrate that Hsp90 association was not responsible for the low ErbB2 kinase activity, and activation of ErbB2 by αC-β4 loop mutations is not due to Hsp90 release.FIGURE 3Release of Hsp90 binding does not activate ErbB2. A, proteins were expressed in Cos7 cells treated for 1 h with or without 1 μm GA, and cell lysates were subjected to anti-Myc immunoprecipitation. Some immunocomplexes from untreated cells were treated with 1 μm GA for 1 h in vitro. Immunocomplexes were subjected to Western blotting analysis (WB), and kinase assays were performed as in Fig. 1B. ErbBs and Hsp90 were detected with anti-Myc and anti-Hsp90 antibodies, respectively. Kinase activities a"

This translocation can be found as the sole cytogenetic abnormality in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia and in malignant lymphomas. The expression of CALM/AF10 in primary murine bone marrow cells results in the development of an aggressive leukemia in a murine bone marrow transplantation model. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified the lymphoid regulator Ikaros as an AF10 interacting protein. Interestingly, Ikaros is required for normal development of lymphocytes, and aberrant expression of Ikaros has been found in leukemia. In a murine model, the expression of a dominant negative isoform of Ikaros causes leukemias and lymphomas. The Ikaros interaction domain of AF10 was mapped to the leucine zipper domain of AF10, which is required for malignant transformation both by the CALM/AF10 and the MLL/AF10 fusion proteins. The interaction between AF10 and Ikaros was confirmed by GST pull down and co-immunoprecipitation. Coexpression of CALM/AF10 but not of AF10 alters the subcellular localization of Ikaros in murine fibroblasts. The transcriptional repressor activity of Ikaros is reduced by AF10. These results suggest that CALM/AF10 might interfere with normal Ikaros function, and thereby block lymphoid differentiation in CALM/AF10 positive leukemias."
https://openalex.org/W2012313276,"p63 shares considerable sequence identity with p53, especially in its DNA-binding, activation and tetramerization domains. When the upstream promoter is used for p63 expression, three major transactivation p63 (TAp63) isoforms (alpha, beta and gamma) are produced. p63 is also expressed from an alternate promoter located in intron 3, producing three major DeltaNp63 isoforms. Recent studies demonstrated that p63 has the potential to function as a tumor suppressor or an oncoprotein. To further address this, we generated cell lines that inducibly express each TAp63 isoform. We showed that TAp63 isoforms are capable of inducing p53-responsive genes, inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis. Interestingly, we discovered that both the activation domain (residues 1-59) and the proline-rich domain (residues 67-127) are required for TAp63 transcriptional activity. Likewise, TAp63beta(DeltaPRD), deleted of residues 60-133, possessed a greatly attenuated ability to induce endogenous target genes and promote apoptosis, but retained the ability to inhibit cell proliferation when expressed in stable, inducible cell lines. TAp63beta(DeltaPRD) also functioned as a dominant negative to wild-type p63beta in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the loss of function seen with deletion of the proline-rich domain was not due to a DNA-binding defect, as TAp63beta(DeltaPRD) was found to strongly bind endogenous promoters using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Finally, mutational analysis revealed that a PXXP motif at residues 124-127 contributes to the transcriptional activity of TAp63. Altogether, our findings suggest that TAp63 transcriptional activity can be regulated by modification(s) of, or protein interactions with, the p63 proline-rich domain."
https://openalex.org/W2044036917,"The assembly and peptide loading of major histocompatibility complex Class I molecules within the endoplasmic reticulum are essential for antigen presentation at the cell surface and are facilitated by the peptide-loading complex. The formation of a mixed disulfide between the heavy chain of Class I and components of the loading complex (ERp57, protein disulfide isomerase, and tapasin) suggests that these molecules are involved in the redox regulation of components during assembly and peptide loading. We demonstrate here that a disulfide formed between heavy chain and tapasin can occur between cysteine residues located in the cytosolic regions of these proteins following translation of heavy chain in an in vitro translation system. The formation of this disulfide occurs after assembly into the loading complex and is coincident with the stabilization of the alpha2 disulfide bond within the peptide binding grove. A ternary complex between heavy chain, ERp57, and tapasin was observed and shown to be stabilized by a disulfide between both tapasinheavy chain and tapasin-ERp57. No disulfides were observed between ERp57 and heavy chain within the loading complex. The results provide a detailed evaluation of the various transient disulfides formed within the peptide-loading complex during biosynthesis. In addition, the absence of the disulfide between tapasin and heavy chain in TAP-deficient cells indicates that a change in the spatial organization of tapasin and heavy chain occurs following assembly into the loading complex."
https://openalex.org/W2057335151,"The supercontinent Pangea dominated our planet from the Permian into the Jurassic. Paleomagnetic reconstructions have been used to estimate the latitudinal position of Pangea during this 100-million-year period. Atmospheric circulation, recorded by eolian sandstones in the southwestern United States, shows a broad sweep of northeasterly winds over their northernmost extent, curving to become northwesterly in the south: This evidence is consistent with paleomagnetic reconstructions of the region straddling the equator in the Early Permian but is at odds with its northward movement to about 20°N by the Early Jurassic. At least one of the following scenarios must be true: The latitude based on paleomagnetism is incorrect; the interpretation of how winds shaped the dunes is mistaken; the basic climate controls in the Jurassic were different from those of today; or the paleogeographic reconstructions available are insufficient to adequately reproduce the wind fields responsible for dune formation."
