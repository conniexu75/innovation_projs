This specificity is not shared by any previously characterized phage which was tested. The specificity of one of the isolates, f1, has been well correlated with the salmonella cross-streak test described by Zinder."

Ruben’s proposal distinguished two phases of sugar synthesis in the dark: a carboxylative phase, dependent on ATP only, in which COZ enters cellular metabolism by carboxylating an acceptor molecule, and a reductive phase, in which a carboxyl group is reduced by pyridine nucleotide with the aid of ATP. In the ensuing 15 years Ruben’s scheme received experimental support from several directions: (a) Calvin, Horecker, Ochoa, Racker and their associates (4-7) have identified the ATPdependent carboxylative phase in COZ assimilation. They have shown that the entry of COZ into the metabolism of photosynthetic cells depends on the phosphorylation of ribulose monophosphate by ATP to ribulose diphosphate, which is then carboxylated by COZ and cleaved to give 2 molecules of 3-phosphoglyceric acid. (b) The kinetic studies of’ Calvin’s group (8) suggested that the reductive phase of CO2 assimilation is the reduction of 3-phosphoglyceric acid to triosephosphate by a reversal of the well known glycolytic reactions, a mechanism that requires reduced pyridine nucleotide and ATP. (c) In addition to a carboxylative and a reductive phase, the findings in photosynthetic tissues of components of the pentose cycle (cf. 9) afforded a mechanism for the regeneration of the COZ acceptor in photosynthesis, in what might be designated as a third, regenerat,ive phase of CO2 assimilation. (d) Racker (10) obtained in the dark, a synthesis, driven by DPNH2’ and exogenous ATP, of hexose phosphate from C02, in a model multi-enzyme system consisting of glycolytic enzymes from rabbit muscle and yeast? and pentose cycle enzymes from spinach leaves. The carboxylative, reductive, and regenerative phases constitute a cyclic sequence of dark reactions which jointly might be termed a reductive carbohydrate cycle (cf. 7).

This question was answered in the negative when the most distinctive enzyme of the reductive carbohydrate cycle, ribulose-di-P carboxylase, was found in such heterotrophs as Escherichia coli (9, 11) and when the cycle in its entirety was found in the nonphotosynthetic sulfur bacterium"

Analysis of these preparations and the results of digestion studies showed a discrimination against strontium in crystal formation which was related to the rate of crystal growth. The discrimination was greater in the slowly grown, larger crystals than in the smaller, rapidly formed crystals. (auth)"

The scope of the method was increased considerably by Taplin et al. 1,2 who introduced the use of labelled rose bengal. The test achieved great diagnostic value in cases of obstructional and toxic damage. We have been able to improve the method for preparing rose bengal labelled with iodine–131."

During the course of this survey, samples of different plants were also analyzed with the view of discovering whether biogeochemical prospecting methods could be used or not. It was found that the ash of most plant samples possessed a considerably higher radioactivity than the soils upon which they were growing. This observation led to a closer examination of the distribution of plant radioactivity within some districts in southern Sweden. The districts were chosen to cover not only different rock and soil types but also different topographic sites. The plants collected included the following species: Picea abies, Pinus silvatica Juniperus communis, Fagus silvatica, Quercus robur, Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus, V. vitis-idæa, Polytrichum, and Athyrium."
