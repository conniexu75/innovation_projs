With these methods, 35S-labeled chondroitin sulfates A, B, and C in a given mixture have been precisely and rapidly determined by measuring radioactivity alone. The methods have also been utilized to determine chondroitin sulfates A, B, and C in as little as 4 ml of normal urine."

https://openalex.org/W2051991390,"Tritiated H3-digoxin specifically binds to a cardiac (Na+ + K+)-activated adenosine triphosphatase. In the presence of adenosine triphosphate and other nucleoside di- and triphosphates, binding is stimulated by sodium ion, the apparent rate constant being similar to that reported for phosphorus-32 incorporation from adenosine triphosphate and for adenosine triphosphatase activity. In the presence of magnesium, manganese, inorganic phosphate, or other ions, sodium ion inhibits binding. The data support an allosteric type of sodium-potassium ion pump."
https://openalex.org/W1499782907,"Abstract Mitochondria of the respiration-deficient cytoplasmic petite mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae contain adenosine triphosphatase. The enzyme associated with the mutant mitochondria is cold-labile and insensitive to oligomycin. In contrast, ATPase bound to mitochondria of the wild type strain is cold-stable and strongly inhibited by oligomycin. The mitochondrial ATPase of the petite mutant was purified and compared with the corresponding enzyme isolated from wild type cells. The two enzyme preparations were found to be indistinguishable with respect to enzymic properties, sedimentation coefficient, and immunological specificity. The purified mitochondrial ATPase from the petite mutant was bound to ATPase-deficient submitochondrial particles prepared from bovine heart mitochondria. The yeast enzyme was thereby rendered cold-stable and sensitive to oligomycin. It is concluded that the mitochondrial ATPase itself is not altered in the petite mutant. The unusual properties of the enzyme associated with the mutant mitochondria thus reflect an impairment of its linkage to the inner mitochondrial membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1633743685,"Abstract Electric organ microsomes from Electrophorus electricus can be phosphorylated by ATP. The properties of this reaction have been studied and compared with the properties of the sodium-potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase and the Na+-dependent ATP-ADP exchange reaction which occur in the same microsomal preparation. Only sodium ion, among the monovalent cations tested, will increase the extent of microsomal phosphorylation. The phosphorylation also appears to be specific for ATP. The Na+-dependent, ATP-specific phosphorylation is not prevented by treatment with N-ethylmaleimide or oligomycin. Under some conditions, ouabain inhibits the phosphorylation. Following phosphorylation in the presence of sodium and ATP, potassium and most monovalent cations decrease the extent of phosphorylation. This reduction is prevented by N-ethylmaleimide or oligomycin, which, in an earlier report, were shown to inhibit Na+-K+-ATPase and to activate a Na+-dependent ATP-ADP exchange. Other workers had reported that hydroxylamine dephosphorylates brain microsomes without inhibiting Na+-K+-ATPase, thus questioning the relevance of the Na+-dependent phosphorylation reaction. With electric organ microsomes, hydroxylamine will replace K+ to some extent in the activation of ATP hydrolysis. Hydroxylamine will also reduce the extent of phosphorylation of native microsomes. However, under comparable conditions, hydroxylamine does not dephosphorylate acid-denatured microsomes. Thus any hydroxylaminolysis of the microsomal phosphate which may occur is slow relative to the turnover rate of the intact enzyme. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the Na+-dependent phosphorylation and exchange reactions are manifestations of the Na+-K+-ATPase and represent the initial step in a sequence of reactions to achieve hydrolysis of ATP. This sequence of reactions is probably related to the mechanism of active cation transport across cell membranes."

It is soluble in 0.6 molar potassium chloride and insoluble in 0.1 molar potassium chloride. It superprecipitates with magnesium ions and adenosine triphosphate. It has adenosine triphosphatase activity stimulated by either magnesium or calcium ions. Both superprecipitation and adenosine triphosphatase activity are inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate and Mersalyl but not by ouabain.
https://openalex.org/W1523981695,"1. A mitochondrial fraction from beef heart (TU-particles) was shown to confer rutamycin sensitivity to added mitochondrial ATPase (F1). After sonic oscillation at an alkaline pH, the resulting particles (TUA-particles) no longer had this activity. A rutamycin sensitivity factor (Fc), purified from crude preparations of coupling factor 4, restored the capacity of the particles to confer rutamycin sensitivity to F1. Highly purified preparations of coupling factor 5 contained Fc, and the relationship between Fc and F5 is discussed. 2. The binding of F1 to TUA-particles was shown to take place with Mg++ (0.8 m M ) alone, but the bound ATPase was insensitive to rutamycin. Other divalent cations were less effective at these low concentrations; higher concentrations of monovalent cations (20 to 50 m M ) substituted for Mg++. The particulate ATPase activity was rendered rutamycin-sensitive by addition of Fc. 3. Exposure of either TUA-particles or Fc to heat or to trypsin resulted in complete loss of rutamycin sensitivity of the reconstituted system. This finding indicates that two labile factors contribute to the phenomenon. In contrast to the lability of the individual components, the Fc-TUA-F1 particle complex was resistant to heat and trypsin treatment under the same conditions. This observation represents another example of allotopy. 4. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide was shown to inhibit particle-bound ATPase in a manner similar to rutamycin, except that no reversibility could be demonstrated. The site of action of dicyclocarbodiimide was shown to be associated with the particles and not with Fc."
https://openalex.org/W1502468878,"Abstract An oligomycin-sensitive adenosine triphosphatase complex has been purified from bovine heart mitochondria by ammonium sulfate fractionation in presence of bile salts. With the exception of flavin and a small amount of cytochromes b and c1 the preparation is devoid of electron transfer components. The catalytic properties of the ATPase complex as judged by sensitivity to various inhibitors, specificity toward triphosphonucleotides, and activation by metals are not changed during the course of the isolation from sub-mitochondrial particles. The oligomycin-sensitive ATPase complex has been further resolved into two fractions. One of these is a soluble ATPase enzyme which is not inhibited by oligomycin and is cold inactivated. This water-soluble enzyme has been identified with the previously isolated F1. Analysis of the protein components of the oligomycin-sensitive ATPase by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel indicates that the enzyme complex contains in addition to the set of proteins characteristic of F1, two proteins that are not referable to F1."
https://openalex.org/W1673437121,"Abstract Human erythrocyte membranes were incubated with a low concentration of terminally labeled ATP with the aim of detecting a phosphorylated intermediate of adenosine triphosphatase activity. A large portion of material labeled briefly at 37° turned over and had properties consistent with participation in sodium ion-stimulated ATPase activity, including the following: (a) magnesium ions present, addition of sodium ions stimulated an increase in both 32P bound to trichloracetic acid-precipitated membrane material and the rate of ATP hydrolysis. (b) The Na+-activated bound 32P turned over and correlated quantitatively with the amount of bound 32P sensitive to hydroxylamine, in agreement with properties of phosphorylated intermediate of ATPase of other preparations. (c) Addition of potassium ions stimulated breakdown of the 32P bound in the presence of sodium ions. At 0°, a large portion of material labeled briefly was sensitive to hydroxylamine. Its turnover was apparent upon addition of excess ATP or ADP, but not guanosine triphosphate, deoxyguanosine diphosphate, AMP, or 3-phosphoglycerate. The addition of ethylenediamine tetraacetate allowed dephosphorylation of the bound 32P to proceed, and it was shown that the approximate rate of turnover was similar to the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Although the addition of sodium ions stimulated an increase in bound 32P and in ATPase activity at 2 µm ATP concentration, manifestations of altered sensitivity to sodium and potassium ions at 0° have been attributed to temperature-induced changes in conformation of catalytic sites. The relationship of membrane (14C)ADP-ATP exchange activity to ATPase activity was investigated. It was found that at least 30% of the exchange activity was associated with material which could be separated from ATP hydrolytic activity and which was not labeled with 32P after incubation with terminally labeled ATP. This activity did not appear to be related to other membrane activities tested, including nucleoside diphosphokinase, adenylate kinase, and phosphoglycerate kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1506810308,"Abstract The kinetic behavior of crystalline heart phosphofructokinase was studied under different conditions. At pH 8.2 the enzyme exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to ATP, fructose 6-phosphate, or Mg++. The Michaelis constants for these substrates were determined. At pH 6.9, ATP inhibited the enzyme. The presence of a lag period was demonstrated when the enzyme was incubated with ATP. Analysis of the kinetic data by means of the Hill equation revealed that the apparent order of the reaction with respect to fructose-6-P was more than one. When the ATP concentration was increased, the apparent order of the reaction was also increased, up to a value of 2.5. Activators such as cyclic 3',5'-AMP reduced the apparent Km for fructose-6-P. Cyclic 3',5'-AMP caused a change to first order kinetics in the presence of low ATP concentrations. At higher concentrations of ATP, cyclic 3',5'-AMP caused a significant decrease in the sigmoid shape of the saturation curves for fructose-6-P, with little change in the apparent order of the reaction. A form of phosphofructokinase was isolated in the absence of stabilizers (ATP and fructose-1,6-di-P). It was found to be more sensitive to ATP inhibition, as evidenced by a lower apparent Ki, and gave curves for fructose-6-P which were more sigmoid than those of the native enzyme. Crystalline heart phosphofructokinase (s20,ω = 14.5) could be reversibly dissociated to a subactive protomer with an s20,ω value of 7.5 at pH 6.5. The enzyme could further be dissociated in the presence of 5 m guanidine HCl to smaller subunits with an s20,ω value of 2.75, which had no enzyme activity. The effect of different ligands on the sedimentation behavior of the enzyme at pH 6.5 was investigated. ATP was found to favor the dissociated form of the enzyme (7.5 S). Fructose 1,6-di-P favored the fully active polymerized form of the enzyme. Based on the present results and previous reports, a model for the molecular organization of phosphofructokinase is presented."
https://openalex.org/W58370825,"The free fatty acids octanoate, laurate, myristate, palmitate, and elaidate inhibit in vitro the activity of liver glucokinase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and lactate production from glucose and glucose 6-phosphate. The inhibition is time- and concentration-dependent. The longer chain fatty acids are more effective at lower concentrations than is octanoate. There is selective protection of the glucose-phosphorylating enzymes by their substrate, glucose, and phosphofructokinase is protected by its substrate, fructose 6-phosphate. The possibility is discussed that a stimulation of gluconeogenesis might be caused by the inhibition of key enzymes of glycolysis by free fatty acids in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1546951316,"Abstract Treatment of rat liver mitochondria with the nonionic detergent Lubrol-WX results in loss of 70% of the protein in soluble form. The vesicular membrane preparation recovered after this treatment is freely penetrated by sucrose and no longer can retain a pool of internal adenine nucleotides; however, it retains the capacity to bind adenine nucleotides in an atractyloside-sensitive reaction. The atractyloside-sensitive site was found to be specific for ADP and ATP; AMP is not bound. The affinity of the preparation for ADP and ATP at the atractyloside-sensitive sites is very high (Kd about 1 µm). The maximum amount of nucleotide bound to these sites has been estimated as about 0.2 nmole per mg of total mitochondrial protein. The affinity for atractyloside is also extremely high; Ki is less than 1 µm. ADP or ATP bound to the atractyloside-sensitive sites is readily exchangeable with free nucleotides in the medium. Atractyloside cannot displace nucleotides from their binding sites. Furthermore, since no competition between nucleotide and atractyloside is apparent, atractyloside and ADP are probably bound at different specific sites on the molecule. When atractyloside is bound first, neither ATP nor ADP can be bound at the nucleotide site. On the other hand, when the nucleotide site is occupied first, subsequent binding of atractyloside at its site prevents the loss or exchange of the bound ADP (or ATP). These properties suggest that the specific ADP-ATP exchange diffusion carrier in the membrane may undergo conformational changes on binding atractyloside so that nucleotides cannot be bound or, if they have already been bound, they cannot be lost."
https://openalex.org/W1518696392,"Abstract The properties of dermatan sulfate, isolated from umbilical cord, have been compared with those of pig skin dermatan sulfate. Like the latter polysaccharide, umbilical cord dermatan sulfate was found to be a hybrid containing both l-iduronic and d-glucuronic acid; whereas the galactosamine units of pig skin dermatan sulfate were exclusively 4-sulfated, the umbilical cord polysaccharide contained a considerable proportion of 6-sulfated galactosamine residues. The latter components were preferentially located adjacent to d-glucuronic acid moieties, while 4-sulfated galactosamine units were prevalent in l-iduronic acid-containing sections of the molecule. Evidence was obtained, however, indicating that some of the galactosamine residues adjacent to l-iduronic acid moieties were 6-sulfated. This conclusion was based on the characterization of hybrid octasaccharides obtained after degradation with testicular hyaluronidase. These octasaccharides which all had the monosaccharide sequence shown below contained 2 chondroitin 6-sulfate disaccharide units located in the reducing and nonreducing termini, and 2 l-iduronic acid-containing internal disaccharide units which were largely 4-sulfated. Approximately one-third of the latter disaccharides, however, appeared to be sulfated in position 6. [see PDF for sequence]"

https://openalex.org/W2080522983,Production of skeletal muscle hypoplasia by 3-acetylpyridine and its complete reversal by nicotinamide in developing chicken embryos have been confirmed. Cultures of developing embryonic chicken muscle show degenerative effects produced by 3-acetylpyridine; these effects are reversed by nicotinamide. Cartilage production in cultured chondrogenic cells is potentiated by 3-acetylpyridine; this potentiation is completely reversed by nicotinamide. It is suggested that nicotinamide-or pyridine-nucleotide-dependent reactions influence normal differentiation of limb mesoderm cells by inhibiting chondrogenic-cell and potentiating muscle-cell expression or proliferation.
https://openalex.org/W1589494845,"1. A mitochondrial membrane fraction from beef heart (TUA-CF0) was prepared from submitochondrial particles (TUA-particles) by fractionation with ammonium sulfate in the presence of 2% cholate. TUA-CF0 conferred rutamycin or dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) on soluble, mitochondrial ATPase (F1) provided that the rutamycin sensitivity factor (Fc) and phospholipids were added. 2. In the absence of Fc and phospholipids, binding of F1 to TUA-CF0 took place with only a partial recovery of ATPase activity. On addition of Fc, a pronounced masking of this ATPase activity was observed. Reactivation of ATPase activity, which was now sensitive to rutamycin and DCCD, was achieved by addition of crude soybean phospholipids. 3. Some purified phospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine and cardiolipin, gave full reactivation of the masked ATPase activity, but low rutamycin sensitivity. Other phospholipids, e.g. phosphatidylethanolamine, gave only partial activation but high rutamycin sensitivity. 4. Exposure of TUA-CF0 or Fc to mild heating (55°) prevented the masking of added F1. Thus it appears that, like rutamycin sensitivity, the masking of the ATPase activity is dependent on two factors: one in the particles, the other in Fc."
https://openalex.org/W1537460658,"Abstract When phosphorylating submitochondrial electron transport particles (ETPh) are extracted with 2 m NaCl, the residue becomes deficient in adenosine triphosphatase activity and in the capacity to catalyze ATP-energized reactions. A restoration of these capacities can be achieved with the salt-free extract, which is devoid of ATPase activity. Electrophoretic evidence indicates that the salt-free extract is a mixture of subunits of the mitochondrial ATPase (F1). Additional studies have established that subunits of F1, obtained by depolymerizing F1 in the presence of salt at 0°, can substitute for the salt extract in the restoration of ATPase activity and the capability of catalyzing ATP-energized reactions in the salt-extracted particles."

These results are similar to those from 13 previously studied cases and indicate that the entry of chromosomes 13-15 into translocations is nonrandom.

https://openalex.org/W1537574456,"A study was made to identify the components of the region of linkage between polysaccharide and protein of dermatan sulfate from umbilical cord. The sulfated mucopolysaccharides were obtained after digestion of the tissue with pepsin and trypsin, and a dermatan sulfate-polypeptide preparation was isolated and purified. In addition to uronic acid and galactosamine, this material contained approximately 39 µmoles of galactose and 18 µmoles of xylose per g. Treatment of the dermatan sulfate polypeptide with alkali resulted in the cleavage of the mucopolysaccharide from the peptide moiety, with the preferential destruction of the serine from the peptide. When this reaction was performed in the presence of sodium borohydride, there was an increase in alanine concurrent with the destruction of serine and a conversion of the xylose to xylitol. The galactose remained unchanged. These results indicate that the polysaccharide is linked to the protein via the hydroxyl oxygen of serine; this linkage is known to be easily cleaved with alkali by a β elimination reaction. The appearance of alanine upon treatment with alkaline borohydride confirms this mechanism, while the reduction of the xylose to xylitol indicates that xylose is the unit linked to the serine. Digestion of the dermatan sulfate polypeptide with Pronase yielded a product in which the amino acid composition corresponded to a dipeptide of serine and glycine. Serine was found to be the NH2-terminal amino acid, indicating that the peptide structure is serylglycine. This dermatan sulfate dipeptide is comparatively stable to alkali, and it is proposed that β-elimination from serine is minimal when its amino group is free."
https://openalex.org/W1603868171,"Abstract Crystalline phosphofructokinase from rabbit skeletal muscle contains 16 to 18 thiol groups per protomer (93,200 daltons). Six groups reacted immediately with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Pseudo-first order rate constants of 0.0265, 0.0138, and 0.0082 per min were obtained for the seventh plus eighth, ninth plus 10th, and 11th plus 12th thiol groups, respectively, in 0.025 m glycylglycine buffer, pH 8.0, at 28°. The remaining four to six groups reacted very slowly. All thiol groups reacted with Ellman's reagent in 6 m urea, 4 m guanidine hydrochloride, or 3 mm sodium dodecyl sulfate. The thiol content determined by Ellman's reagent approached the half-cystine content determined by amino acid analysis. In the absence of a denaturing agent, fructose 6-phosphate protected two of the six rapidly reacting thiol groups. In the presence of 4 m urea, fructose 6-phosphate as well as fructose 1,6-diphosphate diminished the rate of reaction of the thiol groups with Ellman's reagent. Fructose 6-phosphate seemed to protect highly reactive groups, whereas fructose 1,6-diphosphate exerted its influence on slowly reacting ones. Phosphofructokinase activity was sensitive to 1 mm iodoacetamide. The substrates fructose 6-phosphate and MgATP offered complete protection against this inhibition while the product fructose 1,6-diphosphate did not. About 60% of the enzymatic activity was lost upon alkylation of six thiol groups per protomer."
https://openalex.org/W1538441654,"Abstract Both human plasmin and the activator formed from the equimolar complexation of human plasminogen or plasmin with streptokinase are shown to be irreversibly inhibited by either diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate or 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone. The complete inhibition of plasmin or activator is accomplished by reaction with 1 eq of diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate. The chromatographic and electrophoretic properties of 32P-labeled peptides from trypsin hydrolysates of plasmin or activator inhibited by 32P-labeled diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate are shown to be sufficiently similar to suggest that the active site in both enzymes may be the same. Kinetic experiments have been performed which support the concept that, in the interaction of streptokinase with human plasminogen, conformational changes occur in the plasminogen portion of the complex, leading to the formation of the activator-active site. Thereafter, further reactions occur, probably hydrolytic, which result in the formation of the final activator product, a complex of structurally modified streptokinase with plasmin."

Hellebrigenin 3-acetate and hellebrigenin 3,5-diacetate are about three times more potent toward this enzyme than hellebrigenin is. The 3-iodoacetate and 3-bromoacetate of hellebrigenin were synthesized and were highly potent irreversible inhibitors of the enzyme. The iodoacetate was 20 times more potent than the bromoacetate, as expected from the superior alkylating power of iodoacetate as compared to bromoacetate. The irreversible inhibition of the enzyme by hellebrigenin 3-bromoacetate and by strophanthidin 3-bromoacetate paralleled the affinities of the nonesterified steroids for reversible inhibition; this is further strong evidence for the site-directed alkylation of the (Na + K)-activated adenosinetriphosphatase by the haloacetate derivatives of the cardiotonic steroids."

https://openalex.org/W1590392688,"Abstract The uptake of nicotinic acid and nicotinamide by rat erythrocytes consists of two processes, diffusion and enzyme-catalyzed conversion to nucleotides which do not readily diffuse from the cell. These two processes provide for a very rapid removal of these compounds, especially nicotinic acid, from the external medium. The two processes have been investigated separately with the use of 14C-labeled substrates and fluoride to prevent the formation of nucleotides. Inorganic phosphate stimulates the formation of nucleotides 2- to 3-fold at an optimum concentration of 20 mm. Glycolytic inhibitors other than fluoride, including arsenate and iodoacetate, also arrest the formation of nucleotides. Replacement of glucose with 2-deoxyglucose likewise prevents nucleotide formation. The passage of nicotinic acid and its amide into and out of fluoride-inhibited erythrocytes differed greatly. The passage of the acid ceased when the temperature was lowered to 0° and exhibited a Q10 of about 2 for uptake between 10° and 30°, suggesting that it was transported by facilitated diffusion. On the other hand, free diffusion can account for the rapid uptake and removal of nicotinamide from the cells. Equilibration occurred within 1 min at temperatures between 0° and 37°. Quinolinic acid was taken up only very slightly, and there was no evidence of nicotinic acid mononucleotide formation."

Guanidine, hydroxylamine, and ammonium chloride are inactive. The activation of Ca++ uptake induced by spermine is dependent on ATP, oxalate, and KCl concentration in the reaction medium. At low ATP concentrations, the Ca++ retained by microsomes is released to the reaction medium. In the spermine-containing system, part of the Ca++ is released at a faster rate. Microsomal adenosine triphosphatase activity is inhibited by spermine. The inhibition is not related to the Ca++ concentration in the medium."

Specific activity of this enzyme was measured with varying amounts of adrenal homogenate; at each level there was no significant difference between preparations from vitamin A-normal or -deficient rats with either androstenolone or pregnenolone as substrate. When rats with initial low body reserves of retinyl ester were examined periodically while maintained on a deficient diet, the activities of the homogenates were in the normal range until the animals became moribund. When rats without body stores of retinyl ester but maintained by means of retinoic acid were examined after withdrawal of the supplement, no change in specific activity occurred though weight loss was rapid. When vitamin A-depleted rats, which were losing weight, were restored to normalcy after administration of retinoic acid, the specific activity of the dehydrogenase did not increase. The results do not support previous claims that vitamin A is necessary for the activity of adrenal Δ5-3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase."
