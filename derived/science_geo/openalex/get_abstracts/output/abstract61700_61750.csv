https://openalex.org/W1514186391,"Superoxide dismutase, which catalyzes the disproportionation of univalently reduced oxygen (O2.- + O2.- + 2H+ → O2 + H2O2) and which has previously been demonstrated in a variety of mammalian sources, has now been purified from Escherichia coli. Whereas the mammalian enzyme is blue and contains copper and zinc, the bacterial superoxide dismutase is red-purple and was found to contain manganese. The molecular weight of the E. coli enzyme was found to be 39,500 by sedimentation equilibrium and was shown, by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, to be composed of two subunits of equal size. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry and chemical analysis demonstrated between 1.6 and 1.8 atoms of manganese per molecule of enzyme. The enzyme contains no significant amounts of copper or zinc. The ultraviolet and visible absorption spectra of the enzyme are presented, as are the results of amino acid analysis."

West1 reported its persistence to be 5–12 days on plants, and Lichtenstein2 showed that 97% of a soil application disappeared within three months."
https://openalex.org/W1539868358,"Abstract A deoxyribonuclease has been purified 1,800-fold from Escherichia coli infected with bacteriophage T7. The enzyme has an approximate molecular weight of 18,000, requires a divalent cation for activity, and is inhibited by high concentrations of RNA. The purified enzyme catalyzes an endonucleolytic cleavage of both single- and double-stranded DNA. The rate of hydrolysis of single-stranded DNA is 150-fold that of double-stranded DNA. The hydrolysis of single-stranded DNA results in the formation of acid-soluble oligonucleotides. No acid-soluble products have been observed during the hydrolysis of double-stranded DNA. Identity of the activities toward single- and double-stranded DNA is supported by identical sedimentation rates in sucrose gradients, reaction requirements, rates of heat inactivation, and genetic analysis."

https://openalex.org/W1520536454,"Abstract Sulfhydryl modification of the B protein of Escherichia coli tryptophan synthetase has been carried out to investigate the role of sulfhydryl residues in the active center of this protein and in its interaction with the A protein. Both N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) react with two sulfhydryls per monomer of apo-B protein and one sulfhydryl per monomer of the holo-B protein, which contains 1 mole of pyridoxal phosphate per monomer. The serine deaminase activity and the tryptophan synthetase activity are both largely lost after the reaction of one sulfhydryl in the holo-B protein with DTNB. Similar results are obtained after the reaction of one sulfhydryl in the apo-B protein with NEM. In contrast, after the reaction of one sulfhydryl in the holo-B protein with NEM, the serine deaminase activity is somewhat enhanced, whereas, the tryptophan synthetase activity is largely lost. Kinetic comparisons of the NEM-modified holo-B protein with the untreated holo-B protein show that the Km for l-serine is largely unchanged, but that both the Km for indole and the Vmax in the tryptophan synthetase reaction are changed by modification. Since one sulfhydryl in the B protein is fully protected from NEM modification by pyridoxal phosphate and a second sulfhydryl is partially protected from modification in the holo-B protein by the substrate l-serine, both of these sulfhydryl residues may be located in the active center of the protein. The reactive sulfhydryl residue in the holo-B protein is also protected by interaction with the A protein. However, this sulfhydryl is not necessary for the interaction of the A and B proteins since the holo-B protein modified with 1 mole of NEM still associates normally with the A protein and facilitates its hydrolysis of indole-3-glycerol phosphate."

https://openalex.org/W1508349333,"Abstract The deoxyribonuclease purified from Escherichia coli infected with bacteriophage T7 catalyzes an endonucleolytic cleavage of both single- and double-stranded DNA. During the hydrolysis of duplex DNA single-strand breaks are introduced. These interruptions can be repaired by incubation in the polynucleotide ligase reaction. Prolonged incubation of native DNA with the enzyme leads to fragmentation of the DNA, as measured by sedimentation analysis in neutral sucrose gradients. Hydrolysis of native DNA yields polynucleotides bearing 5'-phosphory1 and 3'-hydroxyl termini; the 5'-end groups are predominantly pyrimidine residues. Extensive hydrolysis of denatured T7, native T7, and native E. coli DNA yields products having average molecular weights of 6 x 103, 1 x 105, and 6 x 103, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1484198893,Abstract Pronounced positional specificity during the acylation of glycerol 3-phosphate to form monoacylglycerol 3-phosphate has been shown with a particulate enzyme preparation from Escherichia coli. Palmitic acid is found to be esterified exclusively to position 1 while unsaturated fatty acids are predominantly esterified to position 2. Evidence for a single enzyme being involved in this specific acylation is presented. This evidence is based on studies of single site mutants of E. coli possessing a glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase of greatly increased thermolability and on chemical modification of the enzyme. Additional experiments show that the acylation of 1-acylglycerol-3-P involves an enzyme activity or activities separate from that which acylates glycerol-3-P.
https://openalex.org/W1482049982,"Incubation of pepsinogen with gossypol, a polyphenolic compound of plant origin, resulted in an inhibition of the autocatalytic conversion of pepsinogen to pepsin that takes place at low pH values. Essentially complete inhibition of the activation process occurred in reaction mixtures containing 2:1 to 3:1 molar ratios of gossypol to pepsinogen in the presence of 10% ethanol; the interaction between gossypol and the zymogen occurred most readily at pH 8.0 and 35°. Extensive dialysis of gossypol-pepsinogen preparations failed to remove the gossypol, and the gossypol-pepsinogen preparations were hydrolyzed much less extensively by trypsin and papain than was pepsinogen under identical conditions. Determinations of free e-NH2 groups in the gossypol-pepsinogen preparations suggested that lysyl residues are involved in the binding of gossypol to pepsinogen. From the evidence presented, it appears that gossypol reacts with pepsinogen only after the protein has undergone a change in conformation and that after reaction has occurred, the conformation of native pepsinogen cannot be reestablished."

https://openalex.org/W1548906832,"A purification scheme for peptidyl transfer RNA has been developed using rabbit reticulocyte ribosomes as the starting material. Completed and released (from tRNA) globin chains are rigidly excluded. Ribosomal RNA and ribosomal proteins are also removed. The procedure has also been successfully applied to Escherichia coli and rat liver ribosomes and may have general applicability for the preparation of peptidyl-tRNA from a number of ribosomal sources. The method consists of treatment of ribosomes with LiCl to precipitate rRNA, removal of the LiCl by gel filtration, and ion exchange purification on diethylaminoethylcellulose. Urea is present in all steps, and the pH is maintained on the acid side of neutrality to protect the ester bond between the tRNA and the peptide. A Sephadex G-200 column run in the presence of sodium lauryl sulfate is used to detect the peptidyl-tRNA. Initial studies of the peptides released from rabbit reticulocyte peptidyl-tRNA indicate the presence of completed globin chains bound to the ribosomes as globyl-tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1581074588,"Abstract The effect of concentration of calcium ions on the capacity for phage development and on the synthesis of phage-specific proteins by complexes of T5-infected Escherichia coli F has been studied. The omission of calcium ions from a chemically defined medium results in the formation of unstable phage-cell complexes. At 10-4 m calcium chloride stable complexes are formed that have the potential for phage development but are restricted in this respect until the calcium ion concentration is elevated to 10-3 m. Class I phage proteins, which are formed for the first 6 min after protein synthesis is first allowed following infection under standard conditions, are synthesized normally by phage-cell complexes at 10-4 m Ca++. However, there is no evidence for the synthesis of Class II or Class III proteins, which first appear at 5 min and 14 min, respectively. Complexes that have been arrested at this first step may reinitiate protein synthesis and viral development upon elevation of the calcium ion concentration to 10-3 m."
https://openalex.org/W1495148646,"Abstract The arrest in the development of bacteriophage T5 and in the synthesis of phage-specific proteins in Escherichia coli F cells infected at a low calcium ion concentration (10-4 m) has been traced to a deficiency in the system for synthesis of a specific class of viral RNA. Previous studies have recognized that during an infection under standard conditions at 10-3 m Ca++ three classes of RNA are formed in sequence during the infective cycle. They are Class I RNA, which appears between 0 and 4 min after infection, and Class II and Class III RNA, commencing at 4 and 9 min, respectively. The predominant RNA species formed during the first 4 min of infection at 10-4 m Ca++ appears to be identical with that synthesized immediately after infection of cells at 10-3 m Ca++ and is therefore Class I RNA. By this time, however, the rate of RNA synthesis has fallen rapidly and thereafter there is a marked change in the composition of the RNA species. At 20 min after infection 75% of the product is Class II RNA. Upon elevation of the Ca++ concentration to 10-3 m the rate of RNA synthesis increases markedly. Class II RNA at greatly elevated levels is the immediate product, and 5 to 6 min later Class III is formed. The arrest in RNA synthesis at 10-4 m Ca++ does not result from the failure of the T5 DNA to inject completely into the host cell nor from a loss of the metabolic capacity of cells to generate nucleoside triphosphates and maintain them within the cell. The interruption in viral development at low calcium ion concentrations probably represents a malfunction of the machinery for DNA transcription beginning with the synthesis of Class II RNA. The cessation of Class I RNA synthesis at either high or low Ca++ concentration probably results from the action of a protein formed early in the infective cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1556561056,"Abstract Treatment of 50 S ribosomes at 37° with sodium citrate and low Mg++ causes unfolding of the structure, permitting external 32P-labeled 5 S ribosomal RNA to bind to the particles. The unfolding of the 50 S ribosome proceeds via an intermediate 35 S stage and ultimately yields a 26 S particle under the experimental conditions used. The unfolded particles retain both 23 S and 5 S rRNA in approximately 1:1 molar ratio and all protein components present in the original 50 S particles. The fact that external, unlabeled 5 S rRNA dilutes 32P-labeled 5 S rRNA bound to 50 S ribosomes indicates that the binding of free 5 S rRNA to the particles takes place as a result of an exchange reaction. The reaction is specific in the sense that dilution of bound 5 S rRNA with transfer RNA (20 molar equivalents) is less than 20%, while that with 5 S rRNA is more than 80%. A kinetic study of the binding of 32P-labeled 5 S rRNA to the unfolded 50 S ribosomes indicates that 1 molar equivalent of 5 S rRNA is associated per particle upon addition of 1.2 equivalents excess of 5 S rRNA. One more molecule of 5 S rRNA is bound to the particle in the presence of 12 molar equivalents of 5 S rRNA. On the other hand, only 0.14 molar equivalent of 32P-tRNA binds to the unfolded 50 S ribosomes in the presence of 1.2 molar equivalents of tRNA. The results indicate that the binding of 5 S rRNA to unfolded 50 S ribosomes is highly specific under the experimental conditions employed."

This sequence shows no homology with the corresponding structure of Escherichia coli thioredoxin except the presence in both thioredoxins of a 14-membered disulfide ring. Furthermore, tryptic peptide maps and NH2- and COOH- terminal residues of the two thioredoxins are different."
