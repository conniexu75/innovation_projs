https://openalex.org/W2128339707,"Somatic mutations in the small GTPase K-Ras are the most common activating lesions found in human cancer, and are generally associated with poor response to standard therapies. Efforts to target this oncogene directly have faced difficulties owing to its picomolar affinity for GTP/GDP and the absence of known allosteric regulatory sites. Oncogenic mutations result in functional activation of Ras family proteins by impairing GTP hydrolysis. With diminished regulation by GTPase activity, the nucleotide state of Ras becomes more dependent on relative nucleotide affinity and concentration. This gives GTP an advantage over GDP and increases the proportion of active GTP-bound Ras. Here we report the development of small molecules that irreversibly bind to a common oncogenic mutant, K-Ras(G12C). These compounds rely on the mutant cysteine for binding and therefore do not affect the wild-type protein. Crystallographic studies reveal the formation of a new pocket that is not apparent in previous structures of Ras, beneath the effector binding switch-II region. Binding of these inhibitors to K-Ras(G12C) disrupts both switch-I and switch-II, subverting the native nucleotide preference to favour GDP over GTP and impairing binding to Raf. Our data provide structure-based validation of a new allosteric regulatory site on Ras that is targetable in a mutant-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2033355897,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) transfer from inland waters to the atmosphere, known as CO2 evasion, is a component of the global carbon cycle. Global estimates of CO2 evasion have been hampered, however, by the lack of a framework for estimating the inland water surface area and gas transfer velocity and by the absence of a global CO2 database. Here we report regional variations in global inland water surface area, dissolved CO2 and gas transfer velocity. We obtain global CO2 evasion rates of 1.8(+0.25)(-0.25) petagrams of carbon (Pg C) per year from streams and rivers and 0.32(+0.52)(-0.26) Pg C yr(-1) from lakes and reservoirs, where the upper and lower limits are respectively the 5th and 95th confidence interval percentiles. The resulting global evasion rate of 2.1 Pg C yr(-1) is higher than previous estimates owing to a larger stream and river evasion rate. Our analysis predicts global hotspots in stream and river evasion, with about 70 per cent of the flux occurring over just 20 per cent of the land surface. The source of inland water CO2 is still not known with certainty and new studies are needed to research the mechanisms controlling CO2 evasion globally."

https://openalex.org/W2051994079,"Despite recent advances in crystallography and the availability of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) structures, little is known about the mechanism of their activation process, as only the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) and rhodopsin have been crystallized in fully active conformations. Here we report the structure of an agonist-bound, active state of the human M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor stabilized by a G-protein mimetic camelid antibody fragment isolated by conformational selection using yeast surface display. In addition to the expected changes in the intracellular surface, the structure reveals larger conformational changes in the extracellular region and orthosteric binding site than observed in the active states of the β2AR and rhodopsin. We also report the structure of the M2 receptor simultaneously bound to the orthosteric agonist iperoxo and the positive allosteric modulator LY2119620. This structure reveals that LY2119620 recognizes a largely pre-formed binding site in the extracellular vestibule of the iperoxo-bound receptor, inducing a slight contraction of this outer binding pocket. These structures offer important insights into the activation mechanism and allosteric modulation of muscarinic receptors. Very little is known about how a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) transitions from an inactive to an active state, but this study has solved the X-ray crystal structures of the human M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor bound to a high-affinity agonist in an active state and to a high-affinity agonist and a small-molecule allosteric modulator in an active state; the structures provide insights into the activation mechanism and allosteric modulation of muscarinic receptors. The structures of many G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including members of the class B and class F families, are now available but little is known about the transitions from the inactive to active states. In this study the authors solve the X-ray crystal structures of the human M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor in the active state bound to the agonist iperoxo alone and in combination with LY2119620, a positive allosteric modulator. The structures reveal that the activated M2 receptor has an extremely small orthosteric binding site, with LY2119620 'sitting' right on top of the agonist. The authors also note that the region that makes up the allosteric site in the inactive conformation of the M2 receptor is too large to bind to LY2119620; this means that the extracellular region needs to contract (by binding to the high-affinity agonist) before LY2119620 can bind to the allosteric site. This GPCR is essential for the physiological control of cardiovascular function, cognition, and pain perception, and since allosteric sites are less conserved in sequence and structure than the orthosteric binding site, the hope is that ligands that bind to allosteric sites could be turned into drugs that selectively interact with only one of the five muscarinic receptor subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2050927297,"The origins of the First Americans remain contentious. Although Native Americans seem to be genetically most closely related to east Asians, there is no consensus with regard to which specific Old World populations they are closest to. Here we sequence the draft genome of an approximately 24,000-year-old individual (MA-1), from Mal'ta in south-central Siberia, to an average depth of 1×. To our knowledge this is the oldest anatomically modern human genome reported to date. The MA-1 mitochondrial genome belongs to haplogroup U, which has also been found at high frequency among Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic European hunter-gatherers, and the Y chromosome of MA-1 is basal to modern-day western Eurasians and near the root of most Native American lineages. Similarly, we find autosomal evidence that MA-1 is basal to modern-day western Eurasians and genetically closely related to modern-day Native Americans, with no close affinity to east Asians. This suggests that populations related to contemporary western Eurasians had a more north-easterly distribution 24,000 years ago than commonly thought. Furthermore, we estimate that 14 to 38% of Native American ancestry may originate through gene flow from this ancient population. This is likely to have occurred after the divergence of Native American ancestors from east Asian ancestors, but before the diversification of Native American populations in the New World. Gene flow from the MA-1 lineage into Native American ancestors could explain why several crania from the First Americans have been reported as bearing morphological characteristics that do not resemble those of east Asians. Sequencing of another south-central Siberian, Afontova Gora-2 dating to approximately 17,000 years ago, revealed similar autosomal genetic signatures as MA-1, suggesting that the region was continuously occupied by humans throughout the Last Glacial Maximum. Our findings reveal that western Eurasian genetic signatures in modern-day Native Americans derive not only from post-Columbian admixture, as commonly thought, but also from a mixed ancestry of the First Americans."
https://openalex.org/W1997695335,"Chemical or traumatic damage to the liver is frequently associated with aberrant healing (fibrosis) that overrides liver regeneration. The mechanism by which hepatic niche cells differentially modulate regeneration and fibrosis during liver repair remains to be defined. Hepatic vascular niche predominantly represented by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells deploys paracrine trophogens, known as angiocrine factors, to stimulate regeneration. Nevertheless, it is not known how pro-regenerative angiocrine signals from liver sinusoidal endothelial cells is subverted to promote fibrosis. Here, by combining an inducible endothelial-cell-specific mouse gene deletion strategy and complementary models of acute and chronic liver injury, we show that divergent angiocrine signals from liver sinusoidal endothelial cells stimulate regeneration after immediate injury and provoke fibrosis after chronic insult. The pro-fibrotic transition of vascular niche results from differential expression of stromal-derived factor-1 receptors, CXCR7 and CXCR4 (refs 18, 19, 20, 21), in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. After acute injury, CXCR7 upregulation in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells acts with CXCR4 to induce transcription factor Id1, deploying pro-regenerative angiocrine factors and triggering regeneration. Inducible deletion of Cxcr7 in sinusoidal endothelial cells (Cxcr7(iΔEC/iΔEC)) from the adult mouse liver impaired liver regeneration by diminishing Id1-mediated production of angiocrine factors. By contrast, after chronic injury inflicted by iterative hepatotoxin (carbon tetrachloride) injection and bile duct ligation, constitutive FGFR1 signalling in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells counterbalanced CXCR7-dependent pro-regenerative response and augmented CXCR4 expression. This predominance of CXCR4 over CXCR7 expression shifted angiocrine response of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, stimulating proliferation of desmin(+) hepatic stellate-like cells and enforcing a pro-fibrotic vascular niche. Endothelial-cell-specific ablation of either Fgfr1 (Fgfr1(iΔEC/iΔEC)) or Cxcr4 (Cxcr4(iΔEC/iΔEC)) in mice restored the pro-regenerative pathway and prevented FGFR1-mediated maladaptive subversion of angiocrine factors. Similarly, selective CXCR7 activation in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells abrogated fibrogenesis. Thus, we demonstrate that in response to liver injury, differential recruitment of pro-regenerative CXCR7-Id1 versus pro-fibrotic FGFR1-CXCR4 angiocrine pathways in vascular niche balances regeneration and fibrosis. These results provide a therapeutic roadmap to achieve hepatic regeneration without provoking fibrosis."

https://openalex.org/W1998416098,"Secreted C-type lectins protect the intestinal epithelium from Gram-positive bacteria; this study shows that for the C-type lectin RegIIIα, bacterial killing occurs in a two-step process whereby the lectin first binds to bacterial peptidoglycans then oligomerizes on the bacterial membrane to form a permeabilizing pore. Reg proteins are a group of C-type lectins secreted by organs that are in direct contact with bacteria in the external environment. RegIIIα is a member of this protein family that binds bacterial surface sugars and kills its bacterial targets in order to protect against tissue invasion that could lead to sepsis. This study details the two-step process by which bacterial killing is accomplished by the human C-type lectin RegIIIα, which destroys Gram-positive bacteria. The lectin first binds to bacterial peptidoglycans, then oligomerizes on the membrane to form a permeabilizing pore that punches a hole in the bacterial membrane, ultimately killing the organism through osmotic lysis. Human body-surface epithelia coexist in close association with complex bacterial communities and are protected by a variety of antibacterial proteins. C-type lectins of the RegIII family are bactericidal proteins that limit direct contact between bacteria and the intestinal epithelium and thus promote tolerance to the intestinal microbiota1,2. RegIII lectins recognize their bacterial targets by binding peptidoglycan carbohydrate1,3, but the mechanism by which they kill bacteria is unknown. Here we elucidate the mechanistic basis for RegIII bactericidal activity. We show that human RegIIIα (also known as HIP/PAP) binds membrane phospholipids and kills bacteria by forming a hexameric membrane-permeabilizing oligomeric pore. We derive a three-dimensional model of the RegIIIα pore by docking the RegIIIα crystal structure into a cryo-electron microscopic map of the pore complex, and show that the model accords with experimentally determined properties of the pore. Lipopolysaccharide inhibits RegIIIα pore-forming activity, explaining why RegIIIα is bactericidal for Gram-positive but not Gram-negative bacteria. Our findings identify C-type lectins as mediators of membrane attack in the mucosal immune system, and provide detailed insight into an antibacterial mechanism that promotes mutualism with the resident microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2138538544,"Genetically identical cells sharing an environment can display markedly different phenotypes. It is often unclear how much of this variation derives from chance, external signals, or attempts by individual cells to exert autonomous phenotypic programs. By observing thousands of cells for hundreds of consecutive generations under constant conditions, we dissect the stochastic decision between a solitary, motile state and a chained, sessile state in Bacillus subtilis. We show that the motile state is 'memoryless', exhibiting no autonomous control over the time spent in the state. In contrast, the time spent as connected chains of cells is tightly controlled, enforcing coordination among related cells in the multicellular state. We show that the three-protein regulatory circuit governing the decision is modular, as initiation and maintenance of chaining are genetically separable functions. As stimulation of the same initiating pathway triggers biofilm formation, we argue that autonomous timing allows a trial commitment to multicellularity that external signals could extend."
https://openalex.org/W2116645326,"A word like Huh?--used as a repair initiator when, for example, one has not clearly heard what someone just said--is found in roughly the same form and function in spoken languages across the globe. We investigate it in naturally occurring conversations in ten languages and present evidence and arguments for two distinct claims: that Huh? is universal, and that it is a word. In support of the first, we show that the similarities in form and function of this interjection across languages are much greater than expected by chance. In support of the second claim we show that it is a lexical, conventionalised form that has to be learnt, unlike grunts or emotional cries. We discuss possible reasons for the cross-linguistic similarity and propose an account in terms of convergent evolution. Huh? is a universal word not because it is innate but because it is shaped by selective pressures in an interactional environment that all languages share: that of other-initiated repair. Our proposal enhances evolutionary models of language change by suggesting that conversational infrastructure can drive the convergent cultural evolution of linguistic items."

https://openalex.org/W2106740469,"During infection and tissue damage, virulence factors and alarmins are pro-inflammatory and induce activation of various immune cells including macrophages and mast cells (MCs). Activated MCs instantly release preformed inflammatory mediators, including several proteases. The chymase mouse mast cell protease (MCPT)-4 is thought to be pro-inflammatory, whereas human chymase also degrades pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that chymase instead limits inflammation. Here we explored the contribution of MCPT4 and human chymase to the control of danger-induced inflammation. We found that protein extracts from wild type (WT), carboxypeptidase A3-, and MCPT6-deficient mice and MCs and recombinant human chymase efficiently degrade the Trichinella spiralis virulence factor heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) as well as endogenous Hsp70. MC-(W(sash))-, serglycin-, NDST2-, and MCPT4-deficient extracts lacked this capacity, indicating that chymase is responsible for the degradation. Chymase, but not MC tryptase, also degraded other alarmins, i.e. biglycan, HMGB1, and IL-33, a degradation that was efficiently blocked by the chymase inhibitor chymostatin. IL-7, IL-22, GM-CSF, and CCL2 were resistant to chymase degradation. MCPT4-deficient conditions ex vivo and in vivo showed no reduction in added Hsp70 and only minor reduction of IL-33. Peritoneal challenge with Hsp70 resulted in increased neutrophil recruitment and TNF-α levels in the MCPT4-deficient mice, whereas IL-6 and CCL2 levels were similar to the levels found in WT mice. The rapid and MC chymase-specific degradation of virulence factors and alarmins may depend on the presence of accessible extended recognition cleavage sites in target substrates and suggests a protective and regulatory role of MC chymase during danger-induced inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1976510931,"The cell wall of Aspergillus fumigatus contains two galactose-containing polysaccharides, galactomannan and galactosaminogalactan, whose biosynthetic pathways are not well understood. The A. fumigatus genome contains three genes encoding putative UDP-glucose 4-epimerases, uge3, uge4, and uge5. We undertook this study to elucidate the function of these epimerases. We found that uge4 is minimally expressed and is not required for the synthesis of galactose-containing exopolysaccharides or galactose metabolism. Uge5 is the dominant UDP-glucose 4-epimerase in A. fumigatus and is essential for normal growth in galactose-based medium. Uge5 is required for synthesis of the galactofuranose (Galf) component of galactomannan and contributes galactose to the synthesis of galactosaminogalactan. Uge3 can mediate production of both UDP-galactose and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and is required for the production of galactosaminogalactan but not galactomannan. In the absence of Uge5, Uge3 activity is sufficient for growth on galactose and the synthesis of galactosaminogalactan containing lower levels of galactose but not the synthesis of Galf. A double deletion of uge5 and uge3 blocked growth on galactose and synthesis of both Galf and galactosaminogalactan. This study is the first survey of glucose epimerases in A. fumigatus and contributes to our understanding of the role of these enzymes in metabolism and cell wall synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1986811563,"Background Severe childhood illnesses present a major public health challenge for Africa, which is aggravated by a suboptimal response to the child's health problems with reference to the health-seeking behaviour of the parents or guardians. We examined the health-seeking behaviour of parents at the Kenyan coast because understanding impediments to optimal health-seeking behaviour could greatly contribute to reducing the impact of severe illness on children's growth and development. Methods and Results Health-seeking behaviour, and the factors influencing this behaviour, were examined in two traditional communities. We held in-depth interviews with 53 mothers, fathers and caregivers from two rural clinics at the Kenyan Coast. Biomedical medicine (from health facilities and purchased over the counter) was found to be the most popular first point of treatment. However, traditional healing still plays a salient role in the health care within these two communities. Traditional healers were consulted for various reasons: a) attribution of causation of ill-health to supernatural sources, b) chronic illness (inability of modern medicine to cure the problem) and c) as prevention against possible ill-health. In developing an explanatory model of decision-making, we observed that this was a complex process involving consultation at various levels, with elders, but also between both parents, depending on the perceived nature and chronicity of the illness. However, it was reported that fathers were the ultimate decision makers in relation to decisions concerning where the child would be taken for treatment. Conclusions Health systems need to see traditional healing as a complementary system in order to ensure adequate access to health care. Importantly, fathers also need to be addressed in intervention and education programs."
https://openalex.org/W2095336539,"Selenoprotein P (SeP; encoded by SEPP1 in humans) is a liver-derived secretory protein that induces insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. Suppression of SeP might provide a novel therapeutic approach to treating type 2 diabetes, but few drugs that inhibit SEPP1 expression in hepatocytes have been identified to date. The present findings demonstrate that metformin suppresses SEPP1 expression by activating AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) and subsequently inactivating FoxO3a in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes. Treatment with metformin reduced SEPP1 promoter activity in a concentration- and time-dependent manner; this effect was cancelled by co-administration of an AMPK inhibitor. Metformin also suppressed Sepp1 gene expression in the liver of mice. Computational analysis of transcription factor binding sites conserved among the species resulted in identification of the FoxO-binding site in the metformin-response element of the SEPP1 promoter. A luciferase reporter assay showed that metformin suppresses Forkhead-response element activity, and a ChIP assay revealed that metformin decreases binding of FoxO3a, a direct target of AMPK, to the SEPP1 promoter. Transfection with siRNAs for Foxo3a, but not for Foxo1, cancelled metformin-induced luciferase activity suppression of the metformin-response element of the SEPP1 promoter. The overexpression of FoxO3a stimulated SEPP1 promoter activity and rescued the suppressive effect of metformin. Metformin did not affect FoxO3a expression, but it increased its phosphorylation and decreased its nuclear localization. These data provide a novel mechanism of action for metformin involving improvement of systemic insulin sensitivity through the regulation of SeP production and suggest an additional approach to the development of anti-diabetic drugs.

During steady-state cell growth, antitoxins typically interact with their cognate toxins to inhibit activity presumably by preventing substrate recognition. We solved two x-ray crystal structures of the Proteus vulgaris tetrameric HigB-(HigA)2-HigB TA complex and found that, unlike most other TA systems, the antitoxin HigA makes minimal interactions with toxin HigB. HigB adopts a RelE family tertiary fold containing a highly conserved concave surface where we predict its active site is located.

The host inhibition of growth B (HigB) protein from Proteus spp. is a RelE family member with a relaxed codon specificity (13Hurley J.M. Woychik N.A.

HigB preferentially degrades 5′-AAA-3′ codons (lysine), but codons containing only one adenosine are sufficient for degradation by HigB (13Hurley J.M. Woychik N.A.

The Proteus vulgaris HigBA TA system was first discovered on an exogenous plasmid that conferred kanamycin resistance and post-segregational killing at elevated temperatures (23Tian Q.B. Ohnishi M. Tabuchi A. Terawaki Y. A new plasmid-encoded proteic killer gene system: cloning, sequencing, and analyzing hig locus of plasmid Rts1.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Tabuchi A. Terawaki Y. A new plasmid-encoded proteic killer gene system: cloning, sequencing, and analyzing hig locus of plasmid Rts1.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The higBA gene pair is not found in Escherichia coli K12 but is found chromosomally in pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E. coli CFT073, and E. coli O157:H7 (25Pandey D.P. Gerdes K. Toxin-antitoxin loci are highly abundant in free-living but lost from host-associated prokaryotes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). The HigB toxin gene and protein are distinguished from those of other RelE family toxins in three ways. First, the higBA operon has an inverted gene structure with the HigB toxin gene preceding its cognate antitoxin (Fig. 1A) (23Tian Q.B. Ohnishi M. Tabuchi A. Terawaki Y.

Second, sequence alignments with other RelE family members indicate that HigB appears to lack conserved catalytic residues required for mRNA recognition and degradation (Fig. 2A). Third, a single adenosine in the context of a codon is sufficient for degradation by HigB (13Hurley J.M. Woychik N.A.

This contrasts with previously proposed strict mRNA sequence requirements for other toxins (11Pedersen K. Zavialov A.V. Pavlov M.Y. Elf J. Gerdes K. Ehrenberg M.

Remarkably, our structure shows that, unlike most antitoxins, HigA makes relatively few contacts with its toxin partner and does not cover the solvent-accessible HigB active site. This structural arrangement implies a possible novel model of inhibition. We also present biochemical data that demonstrate tetrameric HigBA (henceforth denoted as HigB-(HigA)2-HigB to reflect its spatial organization) is required for productive binding to its own DNA operator sequences, validating the functional relevance of our structural data. Plasmids pET21c-HigBA and pET28a-His6HigBA were generous gifts from Dr. Nancy A. Woychik (Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School). A C-terminal hexahistidine (His6) tag encoded on the pET21c construct was added to HigA of the pET21c-HigBA construct by removal of the natural HigA stop codon using site-directed mutagenesis to create pET21c-HigBAHis6. The pET28a-His6HigBA(Δ84–104) plasmid was created by placing a premature stop codon in HigA after the codon 83. All sequences were verified by DNA sequencing (GeneWiz). E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring pET21c-HigBAHis6 and pET28a-His6HigBA were grown at 37 °C with shaking in Lysogeny Broth medium with either 100 μg/ml ampicillin or 10 μg/ml kanamycin, respectively. Protein expression was induced with 0.05 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cultures were grown for an additional 3 h except for pET28a-His6HigBA(Δ84–104), which was grown at 18 °C for 12 h after induction. All cells were pelleted at 4,000 × g for 15 min, washed with size exclusion buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol), pelleted again at 7,000 × g for 10 min, and stored at −20 °C. Cell pellets were thawed on ice, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 250 mm KCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100), and lysed by sonication. Each supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 39,000 × g for 45 min and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter (Millipore), prior to loading onto a 5-ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column using an ÄKTApurifier10 (GE Healthcare) at 10 °C. The column was washed with buffer A (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 250 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm imidazole) and eluted with a linear gradient of the same buffer supplemented with 500 mm imidazole. Elution fractions containing the target proteins were concentrated with a 3-kDa molecular mass cutoff concentrator (Millipore), filtered, and loaded onto a Superdex 200 16/60 column (GE Healthcare). Protein fractions determined to be >95% pure by SDS-PAGE were pooled and used for crystallization or biochemical analyses. Selenomethionine-incorporated HigBA-His6 protein was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells as described (26Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. Atomic structures of the human immunophilin FKBP-12 complexes with FK506 and rapamycin.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar) and purified as described above. Crystals of trypsinized selenomethionine-derivatized HigBA-His6 were grown by sitting drop vapor diffusion in 3–10% PEG 3350, 0.2 m l-proline, and 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, over approximately 2 days at 10 °C. Ethylene glycol was used as a cryoprotectant and added in two increments to a final concentration of 30%. Crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and a single anomalous dispersion dataset was collected at the Northeastern-Collaborative Access Team (NE-CAT) 24-IDC beamline at the Advanced Photon Source using 0.979 Å radiation (Table 1). A total of 113,311 reflections were collected, indexed, and reduced to 16,748 unique reflections (unmerged) to a resolution of 2.8 Å with the program HKL2000 (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.C. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar). Phase determination was carried out using the intrinsic anomalous signals from selenium. A total of 11 heavy atom sites were identified and used for initial phases with the program Autosol of the PHENIX Suite (28Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkoczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N.

During refinement, XYZ coordinates, real space, and B-factors (isotropic) were refined to a final Rwork/Rfree of 19.7/23.8.

Open table in a new tab Crystals of His6-HigBA were grown by sitting drop vapor diffusion in 90 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 180 mm ammonium acetate, 25% PEG 4000, and 4% acetone at 20 °C in 1 week. For cryoprotection, dextrose was dissolved in the reservoir solution and added to the crystallization drop in 15% increments up to 30% (w/v) by exchanging the mother liquor. This was followed by 1–2 min of equilibration, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and a native dataset was collected at NE-CAT 24-IDE beamline. A total of 172,519 reflections were collected, indexed, and reduced to 31,287 unique reflections with the program XDS (30Kabsch W. Xds.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11228) Google Scholar). The structure was solved to 2.2 Å by molecular replacement using the AutoMR PHENIX program (28Adams P.D. Afonine P.V.

Three HigB and three HigA molecules were found in the asymmetric unit (supplemental Fig. S1B). A similar PHENIX refinement scheme was used as with form 1 but with the addition of TLS refinement. Manual model building in Coot was performed to a final Rwork/Rfree of 17.3/21.1% (29Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Protein interfaces, surfaces, and assemblies (PISA) program was used to calculate molecular interfaces and oligomeric states (31Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6769) Google Scholar), and ConSurf was used to map HigB sequence conservation onto the crystal structure (32Landau M. Mayrose I. Rosenberg Y. Glaser F.

Sequence alignments were performed with ClustalW (33Larkin M.A. Blackshields G. Brown N.P. Chenna R. McGettigan P.A. McWilliam H. Valentin F. Wallace I.M. Wilm A. Lopez R. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J.

One hundred microliters of 75 μm protein in SEC buffer were loaded onto a Superdex 75 10/300 column (GE Healthcare). Estimated molecular weights were calculated by comparison with the molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad) (Fig. 5D). Peaks from the SEC chromatogram corresponding to different protein-protein complexes were run on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for analysis (Fig. 5E). Assays were performed as described previously (35Tian Q.B. Ohnishi M. Murata T. Nakayama K. Terawaki Y. Hayashi T. Specific protein-DNA and protein-protein interaction in the hig gene system, a plasmid-borne proteic killer gene system of plasmid Rts1.Plasmid. 2001; 45: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) but with slight modifications. Double-stranded DNA representing the Phig region was generated by mixing chemically synthesized DNA (IDT), heating to 90 °C for 2 min, and slowly cooling to room temperature (Fig. 5A). Protein at a final concentration of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 μm was incubated with 10 ng of DNA for 20 min on ice along with 0.5 mg/ml BSA. Free and protein-bound DNA were resolved on a native 8% polyacrylamide gel prepared with Tris borate, pH 8, EDTA buffer (Fig. 5C). The gel was run at 10 °C for 1 h, and DNA was stained with SYBR Green dye (Invitrogen) and visualized using a Typhoon Trio (GE Healthcare). HigB was modeled on E. coli RelE bound to the Thermus thermophilus 70 S ribosome (Fig. 6 and supplemental Fig. S3) (PDB code 3KIQ) (36Neubauer C. Gao Y.G. Andersen K.R. Dunham C.M. Kelley A.C.

Conserved secondary structural motifs of the RNase fold of RelE and HigB aligned with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 2.4 Å (for 63 equivalent α-carbon pairs) (supplemental Fig. S3). By placing the hexahistidine tag at either the N terminus of HigB or the C terminus of HigA, we were able to solve two different x-ray crystal structures of the HigBA complex (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). Given how small each protein is (the antitoxin is 11.5 kDa and the toxin is 10.7 kDa), we were concerned that the affinity tag may influence potential crystal packing interactions and the overall oligomeric states. However, both crystal structures are entirely consistent, with an overall r.m.s.d. of 0.9 Å for 366 equivalent α-carbon pairs with only a single minor difference within loop 5 of HigB (supplemental Fig. S1C) (38Holm L.

The pro-survival kinase Akt provides an ideal target for the treatment of GBM as Akt signaling is frequently activated in this cancer type. However, the central role of Akt in physiological processes limits its potential as a therapeutic target. In this report, we show that the lipid-metabolizing enzyme phospholipase D (PLD) is a novel regulator of Akt in GBM. Studies using a combination of small molecule PLD inhibitors and siRNA knockdowns establish phosphatidic acid, the product of the PLD reaction, as an essential component for the membrane recruitment and activation of Akt. Inhibition of PLD enzymatic activity and subsequent Akt activation decreases GBM cell viability by specifically inhibiting autophagic flux. We propose a mechanism whereby phosphorylation of beclin1 by Akt prevents binding of Rubicon (RUN domain cysteine-rich domain containing beclin1-interacting protein), an interaction known to inhibit autophagic flux. These findings provide a novel framework through which Akt inhibition can be achieved without directly targeting the kinase.

Despite advances in imaging and neurosurgery over the past 30 years, GBM remains one of the most difficult tumors to manage with a median survival time of ∼14 months following diagnosis (1Stupp R.

Treatment options are limited and invasive, typically including a combination of surgical resection, radiotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy (2DeAngelis L.M. Brain tumors.N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). The less invasive small molecule therapies for GBM have been met with limited success due, in part, to the poor blood-brain barrier penetrance of current chemotherapeutics that limits their access to GBM tumors. Moreover, the aggressive nature of GBM, its genetic variability, and antineoplastic drug resistance further curbs the effectiveness of small molecule inhibitors to treat the disease. The combination of these clinical obstacles contributes to the comparatively short survival times and patient death rate (3Eramo A. Ricci-Vitiani L. Zeuner A. Pallini R. Lotti F. Sette G. Pilozzi E.

Among the most frequently deregulated pathways in GBM are components of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway (4Cheng C.K. Fan Q.W. Weiss W.A.

Activation of PI3K either by cell-surface receptor stimulation or constitutively activating mutations results in phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) production and subsequently initiates signaling cascades by recruiting a variety of molecules containing lipid-binding domains to membranes (5Cantley L.C.

In addition to PIP3, other lipids are known to mediate intracellular signaling events that are required for oncogenic processes.

Multiple cancer types, including breast, gastric, and renal cancers, show elevated PLD activity compared with normal tissue (reviewed in Selvy et al. (13Selvy P.E. Lavieri R.R. Lindsley C.W.

To create the PtS-PLD2 baculovirus, the PtS-PLD2 ORF was ligated into pENTR1A (Invitrogen). After LR recombination into pDEST8 (Invitrogen), baculovirus was produced according to the manufacturer's instructions. A bacterial expression vector for the PtS tag was created by amplification of the PtS tag from PtS-pcDNA5/TO and ligated into pET16b (EMD Millipore). For His6-Akt1 baculovirus production, the Akt1 ORF was amplified from pcDNA3 myr HA Akt1 and ligated into pENTR3C (Invitrogen). pENTR3C was LR-recombined into pDEST10 (Invitrogen) to generate a His6-Akt1 construct, and baculovirus was produced according to the manufacturer's instructions. For protein expression, cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All siRNA was obtained from Dharmacon as a pool of 4 oligonucleotide targeting sequences per relevant target (ON-TARGETplus). Cells were transfected according to the manufacturer's instructions using the Dharmafect 1 reagent and a final concentration of 100 nm siRNA. PLD activity assays were performed essentially as described previously (36Brown H.A. Henage L.G. Preininger A.M. Xiang Y. Exton J.H.

Following experimental treatments, cells were treated with 0.3% deuterated n-butanol (n-butanol-d10) for 30 min prior to phospholipid extraction and quantification of PLD-generated phosphatidylbutanol species. To generate concentration-response curves, U87MG cells were serum-starved for ∼24 h. Cells were treated with the indicated concentration of PLD inhibitor for 15 min prior to addition of n-butanol-d10 and phospholipid extraction. Cells were seeded into clear-bottom, black-walled 96-well tissue culture plates and allowed to adhere overnight to achieve ∼60% confluence the following day. Cells were serum-starved in the presence of indicated inhibitors overnight. Viability was measured by addition of the WST-1 reagent (Roche Applied Science) and reading absorbance at 450 nm. Time of WST-1 incubation was cell line-dependent and ranged from 30 min to 2 h. To measure viability following RNAi treatment, cells were seeded in 60-mm tissue culture plates at 540,000 cells/plate and transfected with 100 nm siRNA. The next day, cells were split into 96-well plates, allowed to adhere overnight, and serum-starved in the presence of inhibitors the following day. Viability was assessed ∼72 h post siRNA transfection Base layers of 0.5 ml of 0.7% agarose (SeaKem GTG-agarose, Cambrex BioScience, Rockland, ME) containing complete neurobasal growth media were prepared in 12-well tissue culture plates. PLD inhibitors or DMSO vehicle controls were incorporated into the base layers. A 0.5-ml overlayer of 0.35% agarose containing CD133+ cells (5.0 × 103) in compete growth medium with PLD inhibitors was applied. Each condition was plated in triplicate wells. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Cells were fed every 2–3 days with complete growth media plus PLD inhibitor. Colony formation progressed for 8 weeks. Crystal violet (0.005%) was used to stain colonies. Large colonies (>50 cells) were scored at ×10 magnification with an inverted phase microscope using an average of four random fields per sample. Lysates were prepared by incubating cell pellets in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm DTT, and complete protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. pan-Akt, Akt-S473, Akt-T308, beclin1, p62, Atg7, p70S6K, p70S6K-T389 antibodies were from Cell Signaling; GAPDH and PLD1 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; β-actin and FLAG (M2) antibodies were from Sigma; pan-cadherin and Rubicon antibodies were from Abcam; and PLD2, HA tag, strep tag and LC3 antibodies were from Abgent, Covance, Qiagen, and Novus, respectively. Bands were quantified using the gel analyzer function of ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). PtS-PLD2 infected Sf21 cells were harvested and collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. Cells were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 50 μg/ml avidin, 1 mm DTT, complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science), and 1 mm PMSF added immediately prior to sonication). Lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Cleared lysate was incubated with strep-tactin affinity resin (IBA) overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with wash buffer (lysis buffer with 0.01% Nonidet P-40). PtS-PLD2 was batch-eluted by incubation of beads with 5 mm desthiobiotin (Sigma) in wash buffer for 10 min, centrifugation at 1,000 × g, and collecting supernatants containing soluble PtS-PLD2. For protein-protein interaction studies, PtS-PLD2 eluates were dialyzed (5,000 MWCO, Invitrogen) overnight against wash buffer to remove desthiobiotin. The PtS protein, used as a control for protein interaction experiments, was produced by transforming BL21 Escherichia coli (Agilent) with the pET16b-PtS plasmid. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.7. At that point, protein expression was induced by adding 100 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and growing bacteria overnight at 18 °C. Bacteria were lysed by incubating in lysis buffer (30 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, complete protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme) for 30 min followed by sonication. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and then loaded onto a 1-ml Hi-Trap chelating column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed until the A280 returned to base line, and nonspecific proteins were eluted using a 40 mm imidazole step gradient. Once the A280 returned to base line, PtS was eluted in a linear imidazole gradient from 40–500 mm. Eluates were pooled and loaded onto a 120-ml Sephadex 75 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare), previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT. Fractions containing PtS protein were collected and pooled for use in binding assays.

Bacteria were grown at 37 °C until A600 reached 0.7. At that point, protein expression was induced by adding 250 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and growing bacteria overnight at 27 °C. Bacteria were lysed by incubating in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm DTT, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 1 mg/ml lysozyme) for 30 min followed by sonication. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and then applied to glutathione-agarose (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. Resin was washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm DTT) and eluted by incubating in wash buffer containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. His6-Akt1 was purified from Sf21 cells essentially as described previously (38Kumar C.C. Diao R. Yin Z. Liu Y. Samatar A.A.

Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (see under “Immunoblotting”) and lysed with three freeze/thaw cycles in dry ice/ethanol, drawing lysate through a 25-gauge syringe needle between cycles. Clarified (10,000 × g for 10 min) lysates were pre-cleared with protein G-agarose (Millipore), and immunoprecipitating antibodies were incubated with lysate overnight. Complexes were captured using protein G-agarose, washed three times in lysis buffer, then eluted by boiling in 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. For in vitro protein-protein interaction assays, 25 nm PtS-PLD2 or PtS tag was incubated with 50 nm His6-Akt1 for 2 h in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 50 μg/ml avidin. Where indicated, 10 μm inhibitor was included in the reaction mixture. PtS-tagged proteins were captured by incubation with streptactin resin for 2 h. Resin was washed three times and proteins eluted by boiling in 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer The general procedure for measuring Akt binding to lipid spots on nitrocellulose membranes has been described previously (39Dowler S. Kular G. Alessi D.R. Protein lipid overlay assay.Sci. STKE 2002. 2002; : pl6Google Scholar). The membrane containing various classes of lipids was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids and contained 2 μg of the indicated lipid per spot. For vesicle competition assays, vesicles were prepared by drying lipids under N2 gas and resuspending in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EGTA. Lipids were vortexed and sonicated until in solution. The vesicles were composed of either 100% 32:0 PC or 95% PC + 5% 32:0 PtdOH (mol %). Recombinant Akt was incubated for 2 h with 200 μm bulk vesicles and then incubated with nitrocellulose membranes overnight. Lipid-bound Akt was determined using a total Akt antibody and chemiluminescence. Lipids were obtained as chloroform solutions from Avanti Polar Lipids. Lipids were dried under N2 gas in glass Pyrex tubes. Dried lipid film was vortexed in DMEM + 0.25 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA and then sonicated for 10 min. The sonicated lipid mixture was further diluted in the DMEM/BSA mixture to a final concentration of 1 mm, and cells were treated for the duration of time indicated in the text. U87MG cells were seeded on 150-mm tissue culture plates at 2.6 × 106 cells/plate (four plates per condition) and allowed to adhere overnight. The following day, cells were washed and media replaced with DMEM plus indicated inhibitor or vehicle, and cells were treated for 6 h. Cells were washed twice in 1× PBS and then scraped in homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in homogenization buffer containing complete protease inhibitor mixture (R"
https://openalex.org/W2020358090,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by high proliferation, poor differentiation and a poor prognosis due to high rates of recurrence. Despite lower overall incidence African American (AA) patients suffer from higher breast cancer mortality in part due to the higher proportion of TNBC cases among AA patients compared to European Americans (EA). It was recently shown that the clinical heterogeneity of TNBC is reflected by distinct transcriptional programs with distinct drug response profiles in preclinical models. In this study, gene expression profiling and immunohistochemistry were used to elucidate potential differences between TNBC tumors of EA and AA patients on a molecular level. In a retrospective cohort of 136 TNBC patients, a major transcriptional signature of proliferation was found to be significantly upregulated in samples of AA ethnicity. Furthermore, transcriptional profiles of AA tumors showed differential activation of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and a signature of BRCA1 deficiency in this cohort. Using signatures derived from the meta-analysis of TNBC gene expression carried out by Lehmann et al., tumors from AA patients were more likely of basal-like subtypes whereas transcriptional features of many EA samples corresponded to mesenchymal-like or luminal androgen receptor driven subtypes. These results were validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas mRNA and protein expression data, again showing enrichment of a basal-like phenotype in AA tumors and mesenchymal subtypes in EA tumors. In addition, increased expression of VEGF-activated genes together with elevated microvessel area determined by the AQUA method suggest that AA patients exhibit higher tumor vascularization. This study confirms the existence of distinct transcriptional programs in triple negative breast cancer in two separate cohorts and that these programs differ by racial group. Differences in TNBC subtypes and levels of tumor angiogenesis in AA versus EA patients suggest that targeted therapy choices should be considered in the context of race."
https://openalex.org/W2166606338,"Disrupting reconsolidation may be promising in the treatment of anxiety disorders but the fear-reducing effects are thus far solely demonstrated in the average organism. A relevant question is whether disrupting fear memory reconsolidation is less effective in individuals who are vulnerable to develop an anxiety disorder. By collapsing data from six previous human fear conditioning studies we tested whether trait anxiety was related to the fear-reducing effects of a pharmacological agent targeting the process of memory reconsolidation - n = 107. Testing included different phases across three consecutive days each separated by 24 h. Fear responding was measured by the eye-blink startle reflex. Disrupting the process of fear memory reconsolidation was manipulated by administering the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol HCl either before or after memory retrieval. Trait anxiety uniquely predicted the fear-reducing effects of disrupting memory reconsolidation: the higher the trait anxiety, the less fear reduction. Vulnerable individuals with the propensity to develop anxiety disorders may need higher dosages of propranolol HCl or more retrieval trials for targeting and changing fear memory. Our finding clearly demonstrates that we cannot simply translate observations from fundamental research on fear reduction in the average organism to clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W1994634312,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are associated with occupational exposure and urban atmospheric pollution. Determination of the genotoxic properties of these compounds is thus of outmost importance. For this purpose a variety of cellular models have been widely used. Reliable results can however only be obtained with models reflecting the specific sensitivity of different organs towards PAHs. In this work, we compared the response to benzo[a]pyrene in cell lines from human lungs (A549) and bladder (T24); two important target organs for PAHs-induced cancer. Human hepatocytes (HepG2) were used as a reference, although liver is not a concern for PAHs carcinogenesis. Adducts arising from the ultimate diol-epoxide metabolite of B[a]P, BPDE, were found to be produced in a dose-dependent manner in HepG2. BPDE DNA adducts were not detected in T24 and in A549 their formation was found to be most efficient at the lowest concentration studied (0.2 µM). These results are probably explained by differences in induction and activity of phase I metabolization enzymes, as well as by proteins eliminating the B[a]P epoxide in A549. In addition to BPDE adducts, oxidative DNA damage, namely strand breaks and oxidized purines were measured and found to be produced only in minute amounts in all three cell lines. In summary, our results emphasize the large differences in the response of cells originating from different organs. Our data also point out the importance of carefully selecting the doses used in in vitro toxicological experiments. The example of A549 shows that working at high doses may lead to an underestimation of the risk. Finally, the choice of method for evaluating genotoxicity appears to be of crucial importance. The comet assay does not seem to be the best method for a compound like B[a]P which induces stable adducts causing limited oxidative damage."

The aim of this study was to measure the in vivo contact forces and friction moments during walking. Instrumented hip implants with Al2O3 ceramic head and an XPE inlay were used. In vivo measurements were taken 3 months post operatively in 8 subjects. The coefficient of friction was calculated in 3D throughout the whole gait cycle, and average values of the friction-induced power dissipation in the joint were determined. On average, peak contact forces of 248% of the bodyweight and peak friction moments of 0.26% bodyweight times meter were determined. However, contact forces and friction moments varied greatly between individuals. The friction moment increased during the extension phase of the joint. The average coefficient of friction also increased during this period, from 0.04 (0.03 to 0.06) at contralateral toe off to 0.06 (0.04 to 0.08) at contralateral heel strike. During the flexion phase, the coefficient of friction increased further to 0.14 (0.09 to 0.23) at toe off. The average friction-induced power throughout the whole gait cycle was 2.3 W (1.4 W to 3.8 W). Although more parameters than only the synovia determine the friction, the wide ranges of friction coefficients and power dissipation indicate that the lubricating properties of synovia are individually very different. However, such differences may also exist in natural joints and may influence the progression of arthrosis. Furthermore, subjects with very high power dissipation may be at risk of thermally induced implant loosening. The large increase of the friction coefficient during each step could be caused by the synovia being squeezed out under load."
https://openalex.org/W2084490313,"Non-visual arrestins scaffold mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are members of MAPK family. Arrestin-3 has been shown to enhance the activation of JNK3, which is expressed mainly in neurons, heart, and testes, in contrast to ubiquitous JNK1 and JNK2. Although all JNKs are activated by MKK4 and MKK7, both of which bind arrestin-3, the ability of arrestin-3 to facilitate the activation of JNK1 and JNK2 has never been reported. Using purified proteins we found that arrestin-3 directly binds JNK1α1 and JNK2α2, interacting with the latter comparably to JNK3α2. Phosphorylation of purified JNK1α1 and JNK2α2 by MKK4 or MKK7 is increased by arrestin-3. Endogenous arrestin-3 interacted with endogenous JNK1/2 in different cell types. Arrestin-3 also enhanced phosphorylation of endogenous JNK1/2 in intact cells upon expression of upstream kinases ASK1, MKK4, or MKK7. We observed a biphasic effect of arrestin-3 concentrations on phosphorylation of JNK1α1 and JNK2α2 both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, arrestin-3 acts as a scaffold, facilitating JNK1α1 and JNK2α2 phosphorylation by MKK4 and MKK7 via bringing JNKs and their activators together. The data suggest that arrestin-3 modulates the activity of ubiquitous JNK1 and JNK2 in non-neuronal cells, impacting the signaling pathway that regulates their proliferation and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2026313030,"The Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE) is a multi-ligand receptor present on most cell types. Upregulation of RAGE is seen in a number of pathological states including, inflammatory and vascular disease, dementia, diabetes and various cancers. We previously demonstrated that alternative splicing of the RAGE gene is an important mechanism which regulates RAGE signaling through the production of soluble ligand decoy isoforms. However, no studies have identified any alternative splice variants within the intracellular region of RAGE, a region critical for RAGE signaling. Herein, we have cloned and characterized a novel splice variant of RAGE that has a truncated intracellular domain (RAGEΔICD). RAGEΔICD is prevalent in both human and mouse tissues including lung, brain, heart and kidney. Expression of RAGEΔICD in C6 glioma cells impaired RAGE-ligand induced signaling through various MAP kinase pathways including ERK1/2, p38 and SAPK/JNK. Moreover, RAGEΔICD significantly affected tumor cell properties through altering cell migration, invasion, adhesion and viability in C6 glioma cells. Furthermore, C6 glioma cells expressing RAGEΔICD exhibited drastic inhibition on tumorigenesis in soft agar assays. Taken together, these data indicate that RAGEΔICD represents a novel endogenous mechanism to regulate RAGE signaling. Significantly, RAGEΔICD could play an important role in RAGE related disease states through down regulation of RAGE signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2075379805,"Measurement of the optomotor response is a common way to determine thresholds of the visual system in animals. Particularly in mice, it is frequently used to characterize the visual performance of different genetically modified strains or to test the effect of various drugs on visual performance. Several methods have been developed to facilitate the presentation of stimuli using computer screens or projectors. Common methods are either based on the measurement of eye movement during optokinetic reflex behavior or rely on the measurement of head and/or body-movements during optomotor responses. Eye-movements can easily and objectively be quantified, but their measurement requires invasive fixation of the animals. Head movements can be observed in freely moving animals, but until now depended on the judgment of a human observer who reported the counted tracking movements of the animal during an experiment. In this study we present a novel measurement and stimulation system based on open source building plans and software. This system presents appropriate 360° stimuli while simultaneously video-tracking the animal's head-movements without fixation. The on-line determined head gaze is used to adjust the stimulus to the head position, as well as to automatically calculate visual acuity. Exemplary, we show that automatically measured visual response curves of mice match the results obtained by a human observer very well. The spatial acuity thresholds yielded by the automatic analysis are also consistent with the human observer approach and with published results. Hence, OMR-arena provides an affordable, convenient and objective way to measure mouse visual performance."
https://openalex.org/W2034181348,"Clonal complex 398 livestok-associated-MRSA (CC398 LA-MRSA) clone is described as a major animal pathogen that can also colonize and infect humans. CC398 methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (CC398 MSSA) is less described. We identified 126 CC398 MSSA strains of human origin within 6380 S. aureus isolates gathered between 2009 and 2011, from the French National Reference Centre for Staphylococci. They were characterized using antimicrobial susceptibility testing, spa typing, DNA microarrays (Identibac S. aureus Genotyping ®, Alere), CC398-specific sequence PCR, ermT (encoding macrolides résistance) PCR. Fifty-three CC398 LA-MRSA collected from French pigs and veal were used as comparators, and phylogenetic relations between human CC398 MSSA and animal CC398 MRSA populations were explored on the basis of spa-typing and DNA microarrays. CC398 MSSA were able to induce a large spectrum of infections (especially skin, bloodstream, and pneumonias). The prevalence rate of this clone was high in MSSA population, i.e., 24.7% in a local prospective study on nasal colonization, and 7.5% in a national prospective study on infective endocarditis. CC398 MSSA isolates were frequently (89%) erythromycin resistant, due to the presence of the ermT gene, a gene not detected in erythromycin resistant CC398 LA-MRSA strains. Expression of staphylococcal complement inhibitor (scn) and the chemotaxis inhibitory protein (chp), was also specific to this population. The CC398 MRSA signature included also a panel of antibiotic resistance genes, especially a type IV or V cassette mec and tetM. CC398 MSSA and CC398 LA-MRSA populations were closely related based on spa-typing and DNA microarrays, with the MRSA strains forming the most derived lineage in phylogenic trees. Both MSSA and MRSA populations may come from common ancestors, which would have evolved in the settings of different selective pressures, explaining the acquisition of ermT, chp and scn for MSSA, and antibiotic resistance genes for MRSA."
https://openalex.org/W2055714061,"A common genetic variant, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) rs2736098, was recently reported to be associated with lung cancer risk in Caucasians. In addition, many studies have investigated the role of this polymorphism in the etiology of cancer of various organs. Nevertheless, the results of related case-control studies remain inconsistent.We hypothesized that the genetic risk variant identified in Caucasians may potentially influence the susceptibility to lung cancer in the Chinese population. To test this hypothesis, a case-control study including 539 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases and 627 cancer-free controls was conducted. Furthermore, to investigate the association between rs2736098 and cancer risk, a meta-analysis based on previously published studies and our case-control study was also performed.Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that individuals carrying the A allele or the AA genotype exhibited a significantly elevated risk of NSCLC compared with those carrying the G allele or GG genotype (A vs. G: OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.02-1.43, P = 0.028; AA vs. GG: OR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.05-2.09, P = 0.025). Additionally, this association was stronger among adenocarcinoma cases (AA vs. GG: OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.12-2.50, P = 0.013; A vs. G: OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.05-1.57, P = 0.016). In the meta-analysis, a borderline significant association between the rs2736098 polymorphism and overall cancer risk was observed (AA vs. GG: OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.07-1.46; AA vs. AG+GG: OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.06-1.41; additive model: OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.02-1.18), and further stratifications demonstrated a moderately increased risk for lung and bladder cancer, Asian ethnicity and hospital-based studies.Our results suggest that the rs2736098 polymorphism may contribute to the risk of lung cancer, especially adenocarcinoma, in the Chinese population. In addition, the current meta-analysis indicates that this genetic variant is only weakly associated with overall cancer risk. However, the rs2736098 polymorphism may affect individual susceptibility to lung and bladder cancer. Further studies are needed to validate our findings."

Inconsistent with its tumor suppressor role, elevated WT1 levels have been observed in leukemia and solid tumors. WT1 has also been suggested to act as an oncogene by inducing the expression of MYC and BCL-2. However, these are only the correlational studies, and no functional study has been performed to date. Consistent with its tumor suppressor role, CDC73 binds to RNA polymerase II as part of a PAF1 transcriptional regulatory complex and causes transcriptional repression of oncogenes MYC and CCND1. It also represses β-catenin-mediated transcription. Based on the reduced level of CDC73 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) samples in the absence of loss-of-heterozygosity, promoter methylation, and mutations, we speculated that an inhibitory transcription factor is regulating its expression. The bioinformatics analysis predicted WT1 as an inhibitory transcription factor to regulate the CDC73 level. Our results showed that overexpression of WT1 decreased CDC73 levels and promoted proliferation of OSCC cells. ChIP and EMSA results demonstrated binding of WT1 to the CDC73 promoter. The 5-azacytidine treatment of OSCC cells led to an up-regulation of WT1 with a concomitant down-regulation of CDC73, further suggesting regulation of CDC73 by WT1. Exogenous CDC73 attenuated the protumorigenic activity of WT1 by apoptosis induction. An inverse correlation between expression levels of CDC73 and WT1 was observed in OSCC samples.

These results strongly suggest that some other mechanisms, such as mutations in CDC73 intronic regions, alternate epigenetic regulation (e.g. histone modifications), or other regulatory inactivation mechanisms including the concomitant overexpression of an inhibitory transcription factor, may be responsible for CDC73 down-regulation in cancer. Using a combination of bioinformatics and molecular approaches, here we report the identification of an inhibitory transcription factor Wilms tumor protein WT1, encoded by the tumor suppressor gene WT1, which negatively regulates the expression of the tumor suppressor CDC73 via binding its promoter and promotes OSCC cell proliferation. A total of 24 OSCC samples were ascertained at the Bangalore Institute of Oncology, Bangalore. All OSCC samples were mostly from the tongue and cheek areas of the mouth. This study was performed with informed consent from the patients and approval from the ethics committee of the Bangalore Institute of Oncology. The specimens were obtained as surgical samples from oral cancerous lesions and adjacent normal mucosa (taken from the farthest margin of the surgical resection). The patients had not been treated at the time of surgery. The clinicopathological data for 24 patients are given in supplemental Table S1. Tumors were classified according to TNM (Tumor, Node, and Metastasis) criteria (15Sobin L.H. Fleming I.D. TNM classification of malignant tumors, fifth edition.Cancer. 1997; 80: 1803-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). Peripheral blood samples were also collected in EDTA-VacutainerTM tubes (BD Biosciences) from 24 patients. The promoter sequence of CDC73 was retrieved by in silico search in two databases: the transcriptional regulatory element database (TRED) (16Zhao F. Xuan Z. Liu L. Zhang M.Q. TRED: a transcriptional regulatory element database and a platform for in silico gene regulation studies.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D103-D107Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and the transcription start site database (DBTSS) using the RefSeq sequence NM_024529. Both the databases gave matched promoter sequences of the CDC73 gene (Fig. 1A). A 1000-bp long sequence encompassing the CDC73 TSS (transcription start site) obtained from TRED or DBTSS was used to identify the putative transcription factor binding sites, using the MatInspector professional program. Cells were grown and maintained in T25 flasks, 6-well, 24-well, or 96-well plates as per requirement. Human cell lines KB (oral squamous cell carcinoma), SCC084 (oral squamous cell carcinoma), SCC131 (oral squamous cell carcinoma), and HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1× antibiotic/antimycotic solution (all from Sigma-Aldrich) in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. HEK293 and KB cells were procured from the National Centre for Cell Science, Pune, India. SCC084 and SCC131 cells were a kind gift from Prof. Susanne M. Gollin, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA. For the luciferase reporter assay, cells were transfected with an appropriate construct or a combination of constructs using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instruction. The luciferase reporter assay was performed after 24 or 48 h of transfection in SCC131 cells using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega) as suggested by the manufacturer. The pGL3-Basic vector was used as a negative control, and the pGL3-Control harboring a SV-40 promoter was used as a positive control. Cells were also co-transfected with the pRL-TK control vector (Promega), encoding Renilla luciferase, for normalizing transfection efficiency. The results were calculated as the relative luciferase unit of a construct over the Renilla luciferase construct. DNA equalization in transfection experiments was carried out using pGL3-Basic or pcDNA 3.1(+) vectors. For overexpression studies, SCC131 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plates. Plasmid constructs were transiently transfected as described above. After 48 h of transfection, cells were used for either the total RNA isolation using the TRIzol reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) or the preparation of total protein lysate using the CelLyticTM Cell Lysis Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). The Western blot analysis was performed as described by Rather et al. (14Rather M.I. Nagashri M.N. Swamy S.S. Gopinath K.S. Kumar A.

Primary antibodies, anti-CDC73 (product C3620), anti-β-actin, and anti-WT1 (product WH0007490M1-100UG), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. β-Actin was used as a loading control. Using bioinformatics analysis, a putative promoter region of CDC73 harboring the WT1 binding site was identified and cloned. Briefly, a reporter construct pGL3-PCDC73 was made by cloning an 825-bp (−425 to +400 bp) long putative promoter region of CDC73 upstream from the luciferase reporter gene in the pGL3-Basic vector. The promoter region was amplified from normal human genomic DNA using primers PROXF (5′-ATCCTCGAGAACCCCAACCCCAAGAGCCCCAC-3′) and PROHR (5′-TTGAAGCTTCCCCTGGGCCACA-GCCATGCCG-3′). The forward and reverse primers harbored sites (bases in bold letters) for XhoI and HindIII restriction enzymes, respectively, which allowed directional cloning of the insert. The insert was first cloned in the TA cloning vector pTZFR/T (MBI Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada). After verifying the insert by sequencing on an ABIprism A310-automated sequencer (Invitrogen), it was then cloned in the pGL3-Basic vector. The pGL3-PCDC73(mut) construct was generated by deleting the WT1 binding site in the CDC73 promoter using primers, PWTMF (5′-GGCGGACGTGCTTAGCGTCCTG-3′) and PWTMR (5′-TCCGCCGGCTCGGGGCGCCG-3′), by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (14Rather M.I.

The ON-TARGETplus siRNA sequences specifically targeting human WT1 and IGFBP2 were procured from Dharmacon Thermo Fisher Scientific. Transient transfection of siRNA targeting WT1 was performed in increasing amounts (25, 50, and 100 nm) using Lipofectamine 2000, as recommended by the manufacturer. Control cells were treated either with 100 nm siRNA targeting IGFBP2 or 100 nm scrambled siRNA (mock). After 48 h, cells were lysed for RNA isolation to assess the gene expression. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized in a standard 20-μl reaction containing 2 μg of total RNA and random hexamer primers, using the RevertAid H minus First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (MBI Fermentas). From the synthesized stock of cDNA, 1 μl was diluted in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) to a total of 10 μl. Thus, cDNA synthesized from 10 ng of total RNA (1 μl of diluted cDNA) was used as a template for RT-PCR. All real-time PCRs were performed using an ABIprism 7900 Sequence Detection System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and the DyNAmoTM HS SYBR Green qPCR kit (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland). The thermal cycling conditions included an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 15 min, 40 cycles at 95 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and 58 °C for 30 s for both GAPDH and CDC73. The relative expression level was computed using the 2−ΔΔCt analysis method and GAPDH or β-actin as an internal control (17Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Analysis of relative gene expression data using real-time quantitative PCR and the 2−ΔΔCT method.Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123298) Google Scholar). For qRT-PCR analysis of WT1 and CDC73 in SCC131 cells, pcDNA3-GFP was co-transfected with pcDNA 3.1(+)-WT1+/+ to normalize the transfection efficiency and calculate the relative gene expression. Primers and their conditions used for qRT-PCR analysis of CDC73, β-actin, GFP, and WT1 are available upon request from the authors. Three OSCC cell lines (SCC131, SCC084, and KB) were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/90-mm dish. After 24 h, freshly prepared 5-aza-dC (Sigma-Aldrich) was added in the dish to a final concentration of 5 μm. Total RNA was isolated after 3 and 5 days from start of the treatment. Dimethyl sulfoxide (used for dissolving 5-aza-dC)-treated cells were used as a control. The WT1 and CDC73 expression analysis was carried out by qRT-PCR using β-actin as a normalizing control. Methylation status of the CDC73 and WT1 promoters was examined using the combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA), following a standard procedure of our laboratory as described previously (18Chakraborty S. Mohiyuddin S.M. Gopinath K.S. Kumar A. Involvement of TSC genes and differential expression of other members of the mTOR signaling pathway in oral squamous cell carcinoma.BMC Cancer. 2008; 8: 163Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of genomic DNA in a total volume of 70 μl was denatured with 8 μl of freshly prepared 3 m NaOH by incubating first for 15 min at 37 °C and then for 3 min at 95 °C. DNA was snapped chilled on ice and then treated with 1 ml of bisulfite reagent (3.25 m sodium bisulfite, 2.5 mm hydroquinone, and 0.36 m NaOH) for 16 h at 55 °C in dark. The bisulfite-treated DNA was purified using the Wizard® DNA Clean-Up system (Promega) and eluted in 100 μl of TE buffer, pH 8.0. The eluted DNA was incubated with 3 m NaOH for 15 min at 37 °C followed by precipitation with an equal volume of 6 m ammonium acetate and 2 volumes of ethanol at −20 °C overnight. The precipitated DNA was washed with 70% ethanol and dissolved in TE buffer. One μl of this was used in amplification by nested PCR using two sets of primers (outer and inner) specific for the CDC73 promoter region. Primers were designed using the Methprimer database. Amplicons from the outer and inner sets of primers were of 517 and 351 bp, respectively, and the amplicon from the inner primer set harbored a total of 9 AciI restriction enzyme sites. To test the efficiency of AciI restriction enzyme, the 507-bp ASPM amplicon from an unconverted DNA was used as a positive control. Approximately 500 ng of DNA was digested with AciI at 37 °C for 5 h. The digests were run on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The restriction site of AciI is as follows: 5′-CCGC-3′. If the C residue in the CpG dinucleotide is methylated, it will remain C following the bisulfite treatment, resulting in the digestion of the amplicon by AciI. However, if it is not methylated, it will convert to U (T in the PCR product), resulting in the loss of AciI restriction site and undigestion of the amplicon. Therefore, digestion of the amplicon is the readout of promoter methylation. The WT1 promoter sequence analyzed for methylation was the same as described previously (19Satoh Y. Nakagawachi T. Nakadate H. Kaneko Y. Masaki Z. Mukai T. Soejima H. Significant reduction of WT1 gene expression, possibly due to epigenetic alteration in Wilms' tumor.J. Biochem. 2003; 133: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Sodium bisulfite-treated DNA was again amplified by nested PCR using two sets of primers (outer and inner) specific for the WT1 promoter region. The final amplicon of 315 bp, generated by the inner set of primers with 8 AciI sites, was digested with AciI. The 433-bp WRAP73 amplicon from an unconverted DNA with 2 AciI sites was used as a positive control. Bisulfite-converted DNA from a normal individual was used as a negative control for the WT1 promoter methylation analysis. Primer sequences used in the promoter methylation analysis are available upon request from the authors. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed using HEK293 cells and an anti-WT1 antibody (product WH0007490M1-100UG) from Sigma-Aldrich, as described previously (20Bajaj V. Singhmar P. Kumar A. Promoter characterization and regulation of expression of an imprinted gene SLC22A18AS.Gene. 2008; 424: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To determine whether the CDC73 promoter was pulled down, a 266-bp region of the promoter from −4 to +262 bp harboring the binding site for WT1 was amplified using qPCR. The -fold enrichment was calculated using 2-ΔΔCt method: ΔCt = Ct of the ChIP DNA − Ct of the input DNA, and ΔΔCt = ΔCt of sample (immunoprecipitated DNA of CDC73 or MYC) − ΔCt of IgG control (SABiosciences). Primers used to amplify the promoter regions of CDC73 and MYC (used as a positive control) are available upon request from the authors. In addition to the ChIP assay, binding of WT1 to the CDC73 promoter was also analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using a standard laboratory procedure. Briefly, end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes for the EMSA were prepared using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; BRIT, Hyderabad, India). The DNA-protein binding was carried out in a 25-μl reaction using 4 μg of HEK293 nuclear extract in a binding buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 1× protease inhibition mixture (all from Sigma-Aldrich). The nuclear extract from HEK293 cells was mixed with all of the components except an appropriate end-labeled probe and incubated for 10 min. For competition experiments, a 50-fold excess of the same unlabeled probe was added 15 min prior to the addition of the end-labeled probe. To analyze the super-shift, an anti-WT1 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added 15 min prior to the addition of an end-labeled probe. Subsequently, 50,000 CPM of an end-labeled probe was added and incubated for 20 min. All incubation steps were performed on ice. Following incubation, DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer at 4 °C and 50 V. The WT1 binding to a specific binding site in the MYC promoter has been demonstrated previously (21Reddy J.C. Hosono S. Licht J.D. The transcriptional effect of WT1 is modulated by choice of expression vector.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29976-29982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and was therefore used as a positive control for the validation of WT1 binding to the CDC73 promoter. Oligonucleotide sequences for the CDC73 promoter used in EMSA are as follows: 5′-GGCGGAGGCGAGGGGGGGGAAGATGGCGGA-3′ and 5′-GGGTCCGCCATCTTCCCCCCCCTCGCCT-3′, whereas oligonucleotide sequences for the MYC (c-MYC) promoter used in EMSA are as follows: 5′-AAAGCAGAGGGCGTGGGGGAAAA-3′ and 5′-TTTTCCCCCACGCCCTCTGCTTT-3′ (21Reddy J.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29976-29982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A double-stranded probe was made by mixing equal quantity of two oligonucleotides in TE, pH 8.0, followed by heating at 65 °C for 10 min. The mixture was then slowly cooled to room temperature for 30 min. The WT1 binding sites are boldfaced. For LOH studies, total genomic DNA from blood and OSCC samples was isolated using the Wizard® Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Matched normal and OSCC DNA samples were genotyped using four highly polymorphic microsatellite markers as described by Rather et al. (14Rather M.I. Nagashri M.N. Swamy S.S. Gopinath K.S. Kumar A.

The entire coding region of CDC73 including its exon/intron junctions was amplified using gene-specific primers and sequenced on an ABIprism A310-automated sequencer (Invitrogen). Primer sequences used in the mutation analysis are available upon request from the authors. The rate of cell proliferation was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay as described previously (14Rather M.I. Nagashri M.N. Swamy S.S. Gopinath K.S.

The rate of apoptosis was measured using the CaspGLOWTM Fluorescein Active Caspase-3 Staining Kit (BioVision, Milpitas, CA) as described previously (14Rather M.I. Nagashri M.N. Swamy S.S. Gopinath K.S. Kumar A. Oncogenic microRNA-155 down-regulates tumor suppressor CDC73 and promotes oral squamous cell carcinoma cell proliferation: implications for cancer therapeutics.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 608-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). An independent two-tailed Student's t test was performed to determine the significance of difference between two experiments. To predict the transcription factors that may regulate CDC73 expression, we took a consensus approach using two bioinformatics tools, the transcription regulatory element database and the transcription start site database, to retrieve the CDC73 promoter. Both the tools identified the same region of 1000 bp from nucleotide positions −600 to +400 as the putative CDC73 promoter (Fig. 1A). To functionally characterize the CDC73 promoter, a construct pGL3-PCDC73 harboring an 825-bp promoter region from −425 to +400 bp was generated (Fig. 1B), transfected in SCC131 cells, and the Dual Luciferase Reporter assay was performed. The results showed that the region has a significantly higher promoter activity over the pGL3-Basic vector (Fig. 1C). The CDC73 promoter sequence was then used as a query sequence in the MatInspector Professional program database which identified putative binding sites for several transcription factors, including that of an inhibi"

Information on parental class (1960) and own mid-life social class (1980 and 1990) was retrieved from the censuses and categorised as High Non-manual, Low Non-manual, High Manual, Low Manual and Self-employed. After identifying adult class, individuals were followed for psychiatric disorder by first admission of schizophrenia, alcoholism and drug dependency, affective psychosis and neurosis or personality disorder (N=24,659) from the Swedish Patient Register. We used Poisson regression analysis to estimate first admission rates of psychiatric disorder per 100,000 person-years and relative risks (RR) by adult social class (treated as a time-varying covariate). The RRs of psychiatric disorder among the Non-manual and Manual classes were also estimated by magnitude of social mobility.The rate of psychiatric disorder was significantly higher among individuals belonging to the Low manual class as compared with the High Non-manual class. Compared to High Non-manual class, the risk for psychiatric disorder ranged from 2.07 (Low Manual class) to 1.38 (Low Non-manual class). Parental class had a minor impact on these estimates. Among the Non-manual and Manual classes, downward mobility was associated with increased risk and upward mobility with decreased risk of psychiatric disorder. In addition, downward mobility was inversely associated with the magnitude of social mobility, independent of parental class.Independently of parental social class, the risk of psychiatric disorder increases with increased downward social mobility and decreases with increased upward mobility."
https://openalex.org/W2074214826,"In vertebrates, nerve muscle communication is mediated by the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine packed inside synaptic vesicles by a specific vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT). Here we used a mouse model (VAChT KDHOM) with 70% reduction in the expression of VAChT to investigate the morphological and functional consequences of a decreased acetylcholine uptake and release in neuromuscular synapses. Upon hypertonic stimulation, VAChT KDHOM mice presented a reduction in the amplitude and frequency of miniature endplate potentials, FM 1–43 staining intensity, total number of synaptic vesicles and altered distribution of vesicles within the synaptic terminal. In contrast, under electrical stimulation or no stimulation, VAChT KDHOM neuromuscular junctions did not differ from WT on total number of vesicles but showed altered distribution. Additionally, motor nerve terminals in VAChT KDHOM exhibited small and flattened synaptic vesicles similar to that observed in WT mice treated with vesamicol that blocks acetylcholine uptake. Based on these results, we propose that decreased VAChT levels affect synaptic vesicle biogenesis and distribution whereas a lower ACh content affects vesicles shape."
https://openalex.org/W2034382770,"Polysaccharide lyases (PLs) catalyze the depolymerization of anionic polysaccharides via a β-elimination mechanism. PLs also play important roles in microbial pathogenesis, participating in bacterial invasion and toxin spread into the host tissue via degradation of the host extracellular matrix, or in microbial biofilm formation often associated with enhanced drug resistance. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a Gram-negative bacterium that is among the emerging multidrug-resistant organisms associated with chronic lung infections as well as with cystic fibrosis patients. A putative alginate lyase (Smlt1473) from S. maltophilia was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, purified in a one-step fashion via affinity chromatography, and activity as well as specificity determined for a range of polysaccharides. Interestingly, Smlt1473 catalyzed the degradation of not only alginate, but poly-β-D-glucuronic acid and hyaluronic acid as well. Furthermore, the pH optimum for enzymatic activity is substrate-dependent, with optimal hyaluronic acid degradation at pH 5, poly-β-D-glucuronic acid degradation at pH 7, and alginate degradation at pH 9. Analysis of the degradation products revealed that each substrate was cleaved endolytically into oligomers comprised predominantly of even numbers of sugar groups, with lower accumulation of trimers and pentamers. Collectively, these results imply that Smlt1473 is a multifunctional PL that exhibits broad substrate specificity, but utilizes pH as a mechanism to achieve selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2089053867,"The tubulin cofactor C domain-containing protein TbRP2 is a basal body (centriolar) protein essential for axoneme formation in the flagellate protist Trypanosoma brucei, the causal agent of African sleeping sickness. Here, we show how TbRP2 is targeted and tethered at mature basal bodies and provide novel insight into TbRP2 function. Regarding targeting, understanding how several hundred proteins combine to build a microtubule axoneme is a fundamental challenge in eukaryotic cell biology. We show that basal body localization of TbRP2 is mediated by twinned, N-terminal TOF (TON1, OFD1, and FOP) and LisH motifs, motifs that otherwise facilitate localization of only a few conserved proteins at microtubule-organizing centers in animals, plants, and flagellate protists. Regarding TbRP2 function, there is a debate as to whether the flagellar assembly function of specialized, centriolar tubulin cofactor C domain-containing proteins is processing tubulin, the major component of axonemes, or general vesicular trafficking in a flagellum assembly context. Here we report that TbRP2 is required for the recruitment of T. brucei orthologs of MKS1 and MKS6, proteins that, in animal cells, are part of a complex that assembles at the base of the flagellum to regulate protein composition and cilium function. We also identify that TbRP2 is detected by YL1/2, an antibody classically used to detect α-tubulin. Together, these data suggest a general processing role for TbRP2 in trypanosome flagellum assembly and challenge the notion that TbRP2 functions solely in assessing tubulin ""quality"" prior to tubulin incorporation into the elongating axoneme."
https://openalex.org/W1977182042,"CD4 and BST-2/Tetherin are cellular membrane proteins targeted to degradation by the HIV-1 protein Vpu. In both cases proteasomal degradation following recruitment into the ERAD pathway has been described. CD4 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, with four extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains containing three intrachain disulfide bridges. BST-2/Tetherin is an atypical type II transmembrane glycoprotein with an N-terminal transmembrane domain and a C-terminal glycophosphatidylinositol anchor, which dimerizes through three interchain bridges. We investigated spontaneous and Vpu-induced retro-translocation of CD4 and BST-2/Tetherin using our novel biotinylation technique in living cells to determine ER-to-cytosol retro-translocation of proteins. We found that CD4 retro-translocates with oxidized intrachain disulfide bridges, and only upon proteasomal inhibition does it accumulate in the cytosol as already reduced and deglycosylated molecules. Similarly, BST-2/Tetherin is first exposed to the cytosol as a dimeric oxidized complex and then becomes deglycosylated and reduced to monomers. These results raise questions on the required features of the putative retro-translocon, suggesting alternative retro-translocation mechanisms for membrane proteins in which complete cysteine reduction and unfolding are not always strictly required before ER to cytosol dislocation.

The transport of proteins across lipid bilayers is crucial for allowing cells to perform a large variety of different tasks necessary to support cell life and proliferation.

The ER resident protein Sec61 is necessary to promote insertion of nascent polypeptide chains into the ER.

Protein translocation across the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum and bacterial plasma membranes.Nature. 2007; 450: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). As important as the import of proteins into the ER is the opposite process of retro-translocation from the ER to the cytosol of misfolded or unfolded proteins, which is necessary to maintain a correct cellular homeostasis. The ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway operates as a quality control mechanism to dispose of such unwanted molecules through proteasomal degradation (3.Vembar S.S. Brodsky J.L. One step at a time: endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 944-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). Retro-translocation, however, also operates in cases of exit from the ER not directly involved in ERAD, as observed for calreticulin (4.Afshar N. Black B.E. Paschal B.M.

Here we report on the mechanism of retro-translocation of two widely studied proteins, CD4 and BST-2/Tetherin, using a novel technique to detect retro-translocation of defined proteins, based on the specific biotinylation in living cells only of molecules that from the ER reach the cytosolic compartment (11.Petris G.

Our results show that both CD4 and Tetherin are dislocated with intact disulfide bridges and hence as partially folded species. We also demonstrate that, although Tetherin can be in part degraded following the autophagy/lysosomal pathway, most of it is retro-translocated and degraded by the cytoplasmic proteasome. These data offer new insights on the mechanism of dislocation and raise questions on the required features of the putative retro-translocon. CD4 cDNA was modified by inserting at the N terminus the coding sequences for a secretion signal, a tag (SV5 tag, GKPIPNPLLGLD), and the biotin acceptor peptide (GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE (27.Beckett D. Kovaleva E. Schatz P.J. A minimal peptide substrate in biotin holoenzyme synthetase-catalyzed biotinylation.Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar)), then cloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen), yielding BAP-CD4. To obtain a CD4 with membrane-proximal BAP (18 amino acids from the transmembrane domain, CD4-BAP), the BAP tag was introduced immediately after Ser-382. A codon-optimized version of gp160 was cloned into pcDNA3 and used in all experiments with CD4. Human Tetherin was tagged with SV5 and BAP immediately upstream of the GPI anchor signal (Tetherin-BAP) and cloned into pcDNA3. Tetherin mutagenized in the two N-glycosylation sites (N65A,N92A) was obtained by site directed mutagenesis (QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit; Stratagene). Tetherin ectodomain, including amino acids 45–160 of human Tetherin (28.Swiecki M. Scheaffer S.M. Allaire M. Fremont D.H. Colonna M. Brett T.J.

Tetherin cyt-ecto cDNA was modified by inserting at its N terminus the coding sequence for a secretion signal to obtain a secreted version of Tetherin ectodomain (sec-ecto). Tetherin with the membrane-proximal BAP (12 amino acids from the transmembrane domain, BAP-Tetherin) was obtained by inserting the BAP tag after Ala-48. Vpu from viral clone NL4-3 was expressed from a pcDNA3 vector containing an N-terminal leader peptide followed by SV5 tag. HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Invitrogen). Cells were transfected in 6-well plates (about 5 × 105 cells/well) by the standard calcium phosphate technique. When indicated, the Vpu-expressing plasmid was co-transfected. pEGFP-N1 plasmid was co-transfected as a loading and transfection control. Approximately 18 h after transfection, medium was discarded and replaced with 2 ml of medium supplemented with 0.1 mm biotin (Sigma), and cells were further incubated for at least 7–8 h. When indicated, after 4 h of incubation with biotin, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Sigma) was added in serum-free medium at a concentration of 10 μm for 4 h or at 5 μm for 12 h. Chloroquine (Sigma) was used at 50 μm for 4 h. The PNGase inhibitor Z-VAD(OMe)-fmk (IMGENEX) was used for 4 h at 100 μm. Transfected HEK293T cells were washed with 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (Fluka) in PBS, pH 6.8, to remove free biotin and lysed with 100 μl/well SDS-lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6% SDS, 20 mm NEM) and sonicated. For gel retardation assays samples were first boiled in SDS-gel loading buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 175 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and then incubated with 1 μg of streptavidin (StrAv) (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature before loading. Gels were blotted onto PVDF membranes (Millipore), reacted with anti-SV5 mAb followed by incubation with an HRP-labeled anti-mouse whole IgG antibody (Jackson) for ECL detection. Quantification of bands was performed with the image processing software ImageJ v1.43 (National Institutes of Health) or using UVItec Alliance detection system. Immunoprecipitations of CD4 and Tetherin were carried out by incubating lysates, diluted three times in TNN buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NEM, 1% protease inhibitors mixture (Sigma)) with anti-SV5 and protein A-agarose (Repligen) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from agarose beads by boiling in SDS buffer. For immunoprecipitation of plasma membrane fractions, intact cells were first incubated with anti-SV5 for 1 h on ice, then washed with cold PBS and lysed in TNN buffer. 500 × g postnuclear supernatants were incubated with protein A-agarose for 30 min, and after washing, bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS buffer. Biotinylated material in the purified fraction was detected in Western blots with anti-SV5 or streptavidin-HRP (Jackson). Where indicated, cellular lysates or eluted material was treated with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase-F) or endoglycosidase H (Endo-H) (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For two-dimensional gel analysis, samples were first run on a nonreducing SDS-PAGE gel. The lane of interest was then cut and incubated with reducing loading buffer for 15 min at room temperature before being run in a second gel under reducing conditions. Where indicated, WB of rabbit anti-EGFP (Invitrogen) was used as loading and transfection control. In WB of cell fractionation experiments rabbit anti-actin (Sigma), mouse anti-calnexin (BD Bioscience), and rabbit anti-Derlin1 (Sigma) were used according to the manufacturers' instructions. Microsome-containing lysates were obtained by resuspending cells in a fractionation buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, and 30 mm NEM, followed by 12 passages through a 1-inch 23-gauge needle and two centrifugations at 500 × g and 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. For the trypsin sensitivity assay recovered supernatants were incubated with 1 μg of trypsin (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. When indicated, Nonidet P-40 was added at 0.5% final concentration. For cell fractionation, 1000 × g supernatants were further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatants represented cytosolic material and pellets the microsomal ER fraction. After a delicate wash in fractionation buffer, pellets were resuspended in the same buffer enriched with 1.2% SDS. Cells were first starved for 30 min in methionine/cysteine-free medium, supplemented with 10% dialyzed FCS and 0.1 mm biotin, then labeled for 10 or 15 min, as indicated, with 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (PerkinElmer) and chased for 120 min in biotin-containing complete medium. Cells were lysed in 100 μl of SDS-lysis buffer, diluted with 400 μl of TNN, and sonicated or digested with DNaseI (Promega) for 1 h at 37 °C. SV5-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-SV5 and protein A-agarose and eluted by boiling in SDS-lysis buffer, and samples were resolved on a nonreducing or reducing 10% SDS-PAGE. Purification of biotinylated material was performed with StrAv-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads; Invitrogen) and the elution obtained by boiling in SDS buffer. Gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid, 10% methanol and incubated for 20 min in Amplify fluorographic enhancer (GE Healthcare), dried, and exposed for autoradiography on Kodak BioMax XAR films. We have used our recently described method of biotinylation in living cells (11.Petris G. Vecchi L. Bestagno M. Burrone O.R. Efficient detection of proteins retro-translocated from the ER to the cytosol by in vivo biotinylation.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e23712Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) to investigate retro-translocation of CD4 and Tetherin induced by HIV-1 Vpu. In this technique, cytosolic expression of the biotin-ligase BirA causes specific monobiotinylation of cytosolically located protein substrates tagged with the 15-amino acid-long biotin acceptor peptide BAP (GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE(27.Beckett D. Kovaleva E. Schatz P.J. A minimal peptide substrate in biotin holoenzyme synthetase-catalyzed biotinylation.Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar)). The BAP tag was fused to ER luminal positions in both proteins, namely at the N terminus for CD4 and in the C-terminal part, just upstream of the GPI anchor signal, for Tetherin (Fig. 1). With this BAP tag configuration, only molecules that have reached the cytosolic compartment will be labeled by biotinylation. A second tag (SV5, 12 amino acids long) was also included next to BAP to favor recognition. The addition of the tags did not alter proper folding because both proteins were displayed on the cell surface as revealed by cytofluorometry with anti-SV5. 5G. Petris and O. R. Burrone, unpublished observation. A functional Tetherin tagged in the same position has been reported previously (15.Perez-Caballero D. Zang T. Ebrahimi A. McNatt M.W. Gregory D.A. Johnson M.C. Bieniasz P.D. Tetherin inhibits HIV-1 release by directly tethering virions to cells.Cell. 2009; 139: 499-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Vpu was also SV5-tagged at its N terminus by fusing a leader peptide followed by the SV5 tag sequence. CD4 and Tetherin were independently co-expressed in HEK293T cells with cytosolic localized BirA (cyt-BirA), both in the presence and absence of Vpu and, in the case of CD4, also with HIV-1 gp160 to obtain a stronger degradation effect (29.Willey R.L. Maldarelli F. Martin M.A. Strebel K. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpu protein regulates the formation of intracellular gp160-CD4 complexes.J. Virol. 1992; 66: 226-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The degree of retro-translocation was determined by monitoring the proportion of biotinylated molecules in a Western blot retardation assay (WB-ra). In this assay denatured samples are run in the presence of StrAv, causing retardation only of biotinylated molecules (30.Predonzani A. Arnoldi F. López-Requena A. Burrone O.R. In vivo site-specific biotinylation of proteins within the secretory pathway using a single vector system.BMC Biotechnol. 2008; 8: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As demonstrated previously for other proteins (11.Petris G. Vecchi L. Bestagno M. Burrone O.R. Efficient detection of proteins retro-translocated from the ER to the cytosol by in vivo biotinylation.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e23712Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), all of the biotinylated CD4 and Tetherin found in cells expressing cyt-BirA corresponds to molecules that have been retro-translocated to the cytosol. As shown in a Western blot retardation assay (Fig. 2A), a small fraction (approximately 5%) of biotinylated-CD4 (b-CD4) was detected in the absence of Vpu, corresponding to spontaneous retro-translocation. In contrast, when co-expressed with Vpu, a substantial proportion of biotinylated CD4 (approximately 30%) could be appreciated only after proteasome inhibition with MG132 because of the accumulation of retro-translocated molecules directed to proteasomal degradation. A band of deglycosylated CD4, generated by the activity of the cytosolic cellular PNGase, was also detected and, as expected for a retro-translocated protein, it was totally biotinylated (completely retarded by StrAv). Analysis of the glycosylation status of the b-CD4 fraction revealed both deglycosylated and glycosylated molecules. The latter were Endo-H-sensitive, therefore indicating that they were retro-translocated from the ER (Fig. 2B). The amount of deglycosylated CD4 accumulated in the presence of Vpu following MG132 treatment was not affected by the presence of BirA, ruling out interference of the BirA enzyme on retro-translocation (Fig. 2C). Further confirmation was obtained in [35S]methionine labeling experiments in cells treated with MG132. As shown in Fig. 2D, b-CD4 was already detected after 15-min pulse labeling in the presence of Vpu, whereas only marginal amount was present in the absence of Vpu. Also in this case, the b-CD4 population consisted of all the deglycosylated molecules and a small fraction of the glycosylated ones. Interestingly, a ladder of lower mobility bands was also detected. These bands, which likely correspond to a previously reported fraction containing CD4 species ubiquitinylated on residues of the cytosolic tail (19.Magadán J.G. Pérez-Victoria F.J. Sougrat R. Ye Y. Strebel K. Bonifacino J.S. Multilayered mechanism of CD4 down-regulation by HIV-1 Vpu involving distinct ER retention and ERAD targeting steps.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000869Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), were not retro-translocated as they did not get shifted by StrAv. Biotinylated CD4 corresponds to cytosolically localized molecules. In fact, trypsin sensitivity assays performed on microsome-containing lysates from MG132-treated cells showed that most of b-CD4 was sensitive to trypsin (a small fraction probably in an unaccessible complex was still present), whereas the nonbiotinylated material was trypsin-resistant, except for the predicted cleavage of the cytosolic C-terminal tail, which produced a band of higher mobility (Fig. 2E). However, the mature, membrane-exposed form of CD4 immunoprecipitated from cells first incubated with anti-SV5 and then washed and lysed, was found essentially not biotinylated, although a faint shifted band (representing a minimal proportion of the total) was detected (Fig. 2F). Interestingly, however, following cellular fractionation, most of b-CD4 was found associated with the microsomal-ER fraction with only a small part of the deglycosylated material recovered in the cytosol, indicating that despite exposure to the cytosol the dislocated material remains largely insoluble (Fig. 2G). In the case of Tetherin, spontaneous retro-translocation (i.e. in the absence of Vpu) was already apparent both in control cells and, with increased amounts, in MG132-treated cells (Fig. 3A, first two lanes and fifth and sixth lanes). When co-expressed with Vpu the relative level of biotinylated Tetherin (b-Tetherin) compared with total Tetherin significantly increased both in untreated and MG132-treated cells (Fig. 3A, third and fourth lanes and seventh and eighth lanes). A complex pattern of bands was observed for Tetherin because it is a protein that undergoes several post-translational modifications, including two N-glycosylations (Asn-65 and Asn-92), the addition of a GPI anchor at the C terminus with the corresponding cleavage of the hydrophobic terminal sequence, and the formation of homodimers covalently stabilized by three interchain disulfide bonds (Cys-53, Cys-63, and Cys-91) between two parallel monomers. Of note, essentially all Tetherin was found processed for the cleavage of the GPI anchor signal.5 In the WBs shown (as in Fig. 3A) the upper set of bands labeled as Golgi/mem corresponds mostly to cell surface-exposed molecules. In fact, membrane-exposed Tetherin immunoprecipitated from the membrane of MG132-treated cells (reacted with anti-SV5 and then washed and lysed) was mostly not biotinylated, resistant to Endo-H and sensitive to PNGase (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 3C, the same set of upper bands was sensitive to PNGase and resistant to Endo-H. In contrast, the group of bands showing an intermediate mobility (labeled ER-glyc in Fig. 3, A and C) represents a relevant fraction of Tetherin that, because of its sensitivity to Endo-H (Fig. 3C), corresponds to glycosylated molecules that have not yet trafficked through the Golgi. A significant part of this fraction was biotinylated; for instance, >70% in the presence of MG132 as shown in Fig. 3C (compare first and third lanes). Only upon MG132 treatment, however, a lower set of bands corresponding to fully biotinylated deglycosylated material (labeled de-glyc in Fig. 3, A and C) became apparent. The cytosolic exposure of b-Tetherin was further demonstrated by co-expression (in cyt-BirA-expressing cells) of BAP-tagged Tetherin and a BAP-tagged control secretory protein (a scFv) that is very efficiently folded and secreted. Whereas Tetherin produced a biotinylated fraction, the control scFv did not (Fig. 3D). As for CD4, cellular fractionation of Tetherin-expressing cells showed that most of the retro-translocated material was associated with the microsomal fraction with only a minor part of the deglycosylated molecules present in the soluble fraction (Fig. 3E). In these experiments the biotinylated material was not the consequence of postlysis activity of BirA because no biotinylation took place when cells expressing only BAP-tagged Tetherin or BirA were mixed before lysis, as shown in Fig. 3F. In contrast, a control protein (MHC-Iα) BAP-tagged in its cytosolic portion (11.Petris G. Vecchi L. Bestagno M. Burrone O.R.

https://openalex.org/W2078762484,"Over the last decade, it has been established that G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signal not only through canonical G-protein-mediated mechanisms, but also through the ubiquitous cellular scaffolds β-arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-2. Previous studies have implicated β-arrestins as regulators of actin reorganization in response to GPCR stimulation while also being required for membrane protrusion events that accompany cellular motility. One of the most critical events in the active movement of cells is the cyclic phosphorylation and activation of myosin light chain (MLC), which is required for cellular contraction and movement. We have identified the myosin light chain phosphatase Targeting Subunit (MYPT-1) as a binding partner of the β-arrestins and found that β-arrestins play a role in regulating the turnover of phosphorylated myosin light chain. In response to stimulation of the angiotensin Type 1a Receptor (AT1aR), MLC phosphorylation is induced quickly and potently. We have found that β-arrestin-2 facilitates dephosphorylation of MLC, while, in a reciprocal fashion, β-arrestin 1 limits dephosphorylation of MLC. Intriguingly, loss of either β-arrestin-1 or 2 blocks phospho-MLC turnover and causes a decrease in the contraction of cells as monitored by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Furthermore, by employing the β-arrestin biased ligand [Sar(1),Ile(4),Ile(8)]-Ang, we demonstrate that AT1aR-mediated cellular motility involves a β-arrestin dependent component. This suggests that the reciprocal regulation of MLC phosphorylation status by β-arrestins-1 and 2 causes turnover in the phosphorylation status of MLC that is required for cell contractility and subsequent chemotaxic motility."

https://openalex.org/W2026030594,"Background Reactive oxygen species arise in the mitochondria as byproducts of respiration and oxidase activity and have important roles in many physiological and pathophysiological conditions. The level of reactive oxygen species is regulated by a number of enzymes and physiological antioxidants, including HO-1, Sod2, catalase and COX-2, etc. And HO-1 against oxidative stress requires an increase in stress-responsive genes, such as Sod2 and catalase. Especially for the activity of HO-1, cobalt protoporphyrin is known to be a potent and effective inducer in many tissues. The transcription factor, FOXO1 is resistant to oxidative stress through downregulating reactive oxygen species production. Previous study showed that FOXO1 induces HO-1 expression by binding to HO-1 promoter. The question whether cobalt protoporphyrin induces HO-1 expression mediated by FOXO1 and subsequently lessens reactive oxygen species production remains to be elucidated. Results Cobalt protoporphyrin enhances the expression of FOXO1 and facilitates FOXO1 binding to HO-1 promoter and increasing its transcriptional activity without influencing the FOXO1 protein stability. CoPP induces HO-1 and other oxidative stress-responsive genes expression, such as catalase, cytochrome c, Sod2, and COX-2, and decreases mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species production, which are mediated partially by FOXO1. Conclusions Cobalt protoporphyrin induces HO-1 and other oxidative stress-responsive genes expression mediated partially by FOXO1, and has an important role in reducing cellular reactive oxygen species level. Cobalt protoporphyrin may be a more promising therapeutic agent to upregulate some antioxidantive genes."
https://openalex.org/W1996549386,"Amphibians with missing, misshapen, and extra limbs have garnered public and scientific attention for two decades, yet the extent of the phenomenon remains poorly understood. Despite progress in identifying the causes of abnormalities in some regions, a lack of knowledge about their broader spatial distribution and temporal dynamics has hindered efforts to understand their implications for amphibian population declines and environmental quality. To address this data gap, we conducted a nationwide, 10-year assessment of 62,947 amphibians on U.S. National Wildlife Refuges. Analysis of a core dataset of 48,081 individuals revealed that consistent with expected background frequencies, an average of 2% were abnormal, but abnormalities exhibited marked spatial variation with a maximum prevalence of 40%. Variance partitioning analysis demonstrated that factors associated with space (rather than species or year sampled) captured 97% of the variation in abnormalities, and the amount of partitioned variance decreased with increasing spatial scale (from site to refuge to region). Consistent with this, abnormalities occurred in local to regional hotspots, clustering at scales of tens to hundreds of kilometers. We detected such hotspot clusters of high-abnormality sites in the Mississippi River Valley, California, and Alaska. Abnormality frequency was more variable within than outside of hotspot clusters. This is consistent with dynamic phenomena such as disturbance or natural enemies (pathogens or predators), whereas similarity of abnormality frequencies at scales of tens to hundreds of kilometers suggests involvement of factors that are spatially consistent at a regional scale. Our characterization of the spatial and temporal variation inherent in continent-wide amphibian abnormalities demonstrates the disproportionate contribution of local factors in predicting hotspots, and the episodic nature of their occurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2065283554,"As microarray technology has become mature and popular, the selection and use of a small number of relevant genes for accurate classification of samples has arisen as a hot topic in the circles of biostatistics and bioinformatics. However, most of the developed algorithms lack the ability to handle multiple classes, arguably a common application. Here, we propose an extension to an existing regularization algorithm, called Threshold Gradient Descent Regularization (TGDR), to specifically tackle multi-class classification of microarray data. When there are several microarray experiments addressing the same/similar objectives, one option is to use a meta-analysis version of TGDR (Meta-TGDR), which considers the classification task as a combination of classifiers with the same structure/model while allowing the parameters to vary across studies. However, the original Meta-TGDR extension did not offer a solution to the prediction on independent samples. Here, we propose an explicit method to estimate the overall coefficients of the biomarkers selected by Meta-TGDR. This extension permits broader applicability and allows a comparison between the predictive performance of Meta-TGDR and TGDR using an independent testing set.Using real-world applications, we demonstrated the proposed multi-TGDR framework works well and the number of selected genes is less than the sum of all individualized binary TGDRs. Additionally, Meta-TGDR and TGDR on the batch-effect adjusted pooled data approximately provided same results. By adding Bagging procedure in each application, the stability and good predictive performance are warranted.Compared with Meta-TGDR, TGDR is less computing time intensive, and requires no samples of all classes in each study. On the adjusted data, it has approximate same predictive performance with Meta-TGDR. Thus, it is highly recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2165532514,"In the seed plants, the pollen tube is a cellular extension that serves as a conduit through which male gametes are transported to complete fertilization of the egg cell. It consists of a single elongated cell which exhibits characteristic oscillations in growth rate until it finally bursts, completing its function. The mechanism behind the periodic character of the growth has not been fully understood. In this paper we show that the mechanism of pressure – induced symmetry frustration occurring in the wall at the transition-perimeter between the cylindrical and approximately hemispherical parts of the growing pollen tube, together with the addition of cell wall material, is sufficient to release and sustain mechanical self-oscillations and cell extension. At the transition zone, where symmetry frustration occurs and one cannot distinguish either of the involved symmetries, a kind of ‘superposition state’ appears where either single or both symmetry(ies) can be realized by the system. We anticipate that testifiable predictions made by the model () may deliver, after calibration, a new tool to estimate turgor pressure from oscillation frequency of the periodically growing cell. Since the mechanical principles apply to all turgor regulated walled cells including those of plant, fungal and bacterial origin, the relevance of this work is not limited to the case of the pollen tube."

The present study investigated transcriptional and metabolic responses to low (U) and normal (N) birth weight (d 75, T1) and postnatal feed restriction (R, 60% of controls, d 98, T2) followed by subsequent refeeding until d 131 of age (T3). Liver tissue studies were performed with a total of 42 female pigs which were born by multiparous German landrace sows. Overall, 194 genes were differentially expressed in the liver of U vs. N (T1) animals with roles in lipid metabolism. The total mean area and number of lipid droplets (LD) was about 4.6- and 3.7 times higher in U compared to N. In U, the mean LD size (µm(2)) was 24.9% higher. 3-week feed restriction reduced total mean area of LDs by 58.3 and 72.7% in U and N, respectively. A functional role of the affected genes in amino acid metabolism was additionally indicated. This was reflected by a 17.0% higher arginine concentration in the liver of UR animals (vs. NR). To evaluate persistency of effects, analyses were also done after refeeding period at T3. Overall, 4 and 22 genes show persistent regulation in U and N animals after 5 weeks of refeeding, respectively. These genes are involved in e.g. processes of lipid and protein metabolism and glucose homeostasis. Moreover, the recovery of total mean LD area in U and N animals back to the previous T1 level was observed. However, when compared to controls, the mean LD size was still reduced by 23.3% in UR, whereas it was increased in NR (+24.7%). The present results suggest that short-term postnatal feed restriction period programmed juvenile U animals for an increased rate of hepatic lipolysis in later life."
https://openalex.org/W1972989025,"Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) has been proposed as a novel molecular target that has translational potential in diverse cardiac diseases, since its upregulation promotes a broadly cardioprotective phenotype. However, ILK has been implicated as both a cardioprotective and oncogenic target, which imposes therapeutic constraints that are generally relevant to the translational potential of many kinases.To study the cardioprotective properties of the activation-resistant, non-oncogenic, mutation of ILK (ILK(R211A)) against experimental MI in vivo and Doxorubicin induced apoptosis in vitro and it's relationships to stress induced heat shock proteins.The transgenic mouse heart over-expressing a point mutation in the ILK pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (Tg(R211A)) exhibits a highly cardioprotective phenotype based on LAD-ligation-induced MI reduction in vivo, and on protection against doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis when overexpressed in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS)-derived cardiomyocytes in vitro. Intriguingly, the degree of cardioprotection seen with the ILK(R211A) mutation exceeded that with the ILK(S343D) mutation. Microarray and immunoprecipitation analyses revealed upregulation of expression levels and specific binding of ILK(WT), ILK(S343D) and ILK(R211A) to both constitutively active heat-shock protein 70 (Hsc70) and inducible Hsp70 in response to MI, and to acute ILK overexpression in iPSC-cardiomyocytes. ILK-mediated cardioprotection was shown to depend upon Hsp70 ATPase activity.These findings indicate that wild type ILK and the non-oncogenic ILK(R211A) mutation comprise a cardioprotective module with Hsp/c70. These results advance a novel target discovery theme in which kinase mutations can be safely engineered to enhance cardioprotective effects."
https://openalex.org/W1983810862,"Membrane proteins of the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC) superfamily transport amino acids and amines across membranes and play an important role in the regulation of cellular processes. We report the heterologous production of the LysP-related transporter STM2200 from Salmonella typhimurium in Escherichia coli, its purification, and functional characterization. STM2200 is assumed to be a proton-dependent APC transporter of L-lysine. The functional interaction between basic amino acids and STM2200 was investigated by thermoanalytical methods, i.e. differential scanning and isothermal titration calorimetry. Binding of L-lysine to STM2200 in its solubilized monomer form is entropy-driven. It is characterized by a dissociation constant of 40 μm at pH 5.9 and is highly selective; no evidence was found for the binding of L-arginine, L-ornithine, L-2,4-diaminobutyric acid, and L-alanine. D-lysine is bound 45 times more weakly than its L-chiral form. We thus postulate that STM2200 functions as a specific transport protein. Based on the crystal structure of ApcT (Shaffer, P. L., Goehring, A., Shankaranarayanan, A., and Gouaux, E. (2009) Science 325, 1010-1014), a proton-dependent amino acid transporter of the APC superfamily, a homology model of STM2200 was created. Docking studies allowed identification of possible ligand binding sites. The resulting predictions indicated that Glu-222 and Arg-395 of STM2200 are markedly involved in ligand binding, whereas Lys-163 is suggested to be of structural and functional relevance. Selected variants of STM2200 where these three amino acid residues were substituted using single site-directed mutagenesis showed no evidence for L-lysine binding by isothermal titration calorimetry, which confirmed the predictions. Molecular aspects of the observed ligand specificity are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2121178305,"c-Myb plays an essential role in regulation of properly balanced hematopoiesis through transcriptional regulation of genes directly controlling cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The transcriptional activity and protein levels of c-Myb are strictly controlled through post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and SUMOylation. Conjugation of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins has been shown to suppress the transcriptional activity of c-Myb. SUMO-1 modifies c-Myb under physiological conditions, whereas SUMO-2/3 conjugation was reported in cells under stress. Because stress also activates several cellular protein kinases, we investigated whether phosphorylation of c-Myb changes in stressed cells and whether a mutual interplay exists between phosphorylation and SUMOylation of c-Myb. Here we show that several types of environmental stress induce a rapid change in c-Myb phosphorylation. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of Thr486, located in close proximity to SUMOylation site Lys499 of c-Myb, is detected preferentially in nonSUMOylated protein and has a negative effect on stress-induced SUMOylation of c-Myb. Stress-activated p38 MAPKs phosphorylate Thr486 in c-Myb, attenuate its SUMOylation, and increase its proteolytic turnover. Stressed cells expressing a phosphorylation-deficient T486A mutant demonstrate decreased expression of c-Myb target genes Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and accelerated apoptosis because of increased SUMOylation of the mutant protein. These results suggest that phosphorylation-dependent modulation of c-Myb SUMOylation may be important for proper response of cells to stress. In summary, we have identified a novel regulatory interplay between phosphorylation and SUMOylation of c-Myb that regulates its activity in stressed cells. c-Myb plays an essential role in regulation of properly balanced hematopoiesis through transcriptional regulation of genes directly controlling cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.

In summary, we have identified a novel regulatory interplay between phosphorylation and SUMOylation of c-Myb that regulates its activity in stressed cells. The c-Myb transcription factor plays an essential role during definitive hematopoiesis through transcriptional regulation of genes that encode protein products that directly control cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (1Oh I.H.

Different protein levels of c-Myb are critical for proper development of specific hematopoietic lineages as demonstrated in experiments with mice carrying hypomorphic c-myb alleles (9Emambokus N.

Progression through key stages of haemopoiesis is dependent on distinct threshold levels of c-Myb.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4478-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The importance of specific protein levels for development was confirmed in ex vivo differentiation assays using embryonic stem cells from knock-out mice with regulated c-Myb expression (13Sakamoto H. Dai G. Tsujino K. Hashimoto K. Huang X. Fujimoto T. Mucenski M. Frampton J. Ogawa M. Proper levels of c-Myb are discretely defined at distinct steps of hematopoietic cell development.Blood. 2006; 108: 896-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, maintenance of appropriate levels of protein seems to be critical for balanced production of hematopoietic cells. Oncogenic forms of c-Myb, in animal model systems, are frequently associated with truncations of either amino, carboxyl, or both termini (14Wolff L. Myb-induced transformation.Crit. Rev.

These truncations result in removal of structural regions with a negative impact on proteolytic stability and transactivation capacity (16Zhou Y. Ness S.A. Myb proteins.

These examples are similar to an activation of c-myb in murine leukemia, where a retrovirus integrates several kilobases upstream of the c-myb transcription start site and deregulates its expression (26Koller R. Krall M. Mock B. Bies J. Nazarov V. Wolff L.

Nevertheless, these leukemic cells seem to be dependent on the elevated levels of c-Myb, because knocking down the gene expression is detrimental for those cells, whereas normal untransformed progenitors survive similar treatment (28Anfossi G. Gewirtz A.M. Calabretta B. An oligomer complementary to c-myb-encoded mRNA inhibits proliferation of human myeloid leukemia cell lines.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Thus, these results clearly show that strict regulation of the protein level of c-Myb and/or activity is essential for balanced hematopoietic cell homeostasis, and its deregulation can be leukemogenic. Post-translational modifications of c-Myb, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and SUMOylation are crucial for regulation of the transcriptional activity and steady-state levels of c-Myb (16Zhou Y. Ness S.A. Myb proteins. Angels and demons in normal and transformed cells.Front. Biosci. 2011; 16: 1109-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). c-Myb is a short-lived protein that is rapidly turned over by the ubiquitin/26S proteasome proteolytic system (30Bies J.

Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described previously (38Bies J. Feiková S. Bottaro D.P. Wolff L. Hyperphosphorylation and increased proteolytic breakdown of c-Myb induced by the inhibition of Ser/Thr protein phosphatases.Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2846-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). COS7 cells, transiently expressing c-MybWT, were metabolically labeled in phosphate-free DMEM with 0.5 mCi/ml of carrier-free 32Pi orthophosphate (MP Biomedicals) for 4 h. c-Myb was immunoprecipitated, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membrane immobilized c-Myb was excised, hydrolyzed in 200 μl of 6 n HCl (constant boiling) (Sigma) at 110 °C for 2 h, lyophilized in a SpeedVac (Savant), and resuspended in 10 μl of water containing 0.1 mg/ml of each phosphoamino acid standard, phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine (Sigma). The samples were spotted onto thin layer cellulose plates (Sigma) and separated by electrophoresis (38Bies J. Feiková S. Bottaro D.P. Wolff L. Hyperphosphorylation and increased proteolytic breakdown of c-Myb induced by the inhibition of Ser/Thr protein phosphatases.Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2846-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The migration of phosphoamino acid standards was detected by staining with ninhydrin (Sigma), and 32P-labeled phosphoamino acids were visualized by direct autoradiography. c-Myb protein immunoprecipitated from stressed or unstressed cells with anti-c-Myb antibody was separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with a PageBlue protein staining solution (Fermentas). The gel bands were destained, reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin in the presence of ProteaseMAXTM Surfactant (Promega) at 50 °C for 1 h according to the manufacturer's protocol. MS was performed in the Laboratory of Proteomics and Analytical Technologies, SAIC-Frederick, Inc., NCI (Frederick, MD). The tryptic peptides were analyzed by nanobore reversed phase LC-MS/MS. nanobore reversed phase LC-MS/MS was performed using an Agilent 1100 nanoflow liquid chromatography system coupled online with a linear ion trap-Fourier transform mass spectrometer (ThermoElectron). The linear ion trap-Fourier transform mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent mode where each full MS scan was followed by seven tandem MS scans, and the seven most abundant molecular ions were dynamically selected for collision-induced dissociation using a normalized collision energy of 35%. Tandem mass spectra were searched against a mouse database using SEQUEST software (ThermoElectron). RAW264.7 cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) were washed in PBS and resuspended in 100 μl of Nucleofector kit V (Lonza) supplemented with 0.5 μg of a cMyb-dependent firefly luciferase reporter construct (p5xMRE-A-Luc), 30 ng of Renilla luciferase pCMV-RL (Promega), a control construct used for normalization, and 1.5 μg of constructs encoding either cMybWT, cMybT486A, or cMybSU. Cells were transfected by electroporation using Nucleofector II (Lonza) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was assessed using a dual-luciferase reporter system (Promega) and the TurnerTD-20e luminometer (Turner Designs). We have shown previously that cellular stresses induce rapid conjugation of SUMO-2/3 to two lysines (Lys523 and Lys499) located in NRD of c-Myb. Several protein kinases, including p38 MAPK and JNK families, are also rapidly activated in response to cellular stresses and phosphorylate many targets (37Cargnello M. Roux P.P. Activation and function of the MAPKs and their substrates, the MAPK-activated protein kinases.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2011; 75: 50-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to investigate whether cellular stresses affect phosphorylation of c-Myb and whether these changes in c-Myb phosphorylation may regulate stress-induced SUMOylation of c-Myb. To compare the c-Myb phosphorylation status in cells treated (43 °C) or not treated (37 °C) with hyperthermia, we first labeled metabolically cellular proteins with [32P]orthophosphate in COS7 cells transiently transfected with a c-Myb construct. Labeled cells were split in half and either treated or not treated with hyperthermia for another 30 min. The c-Myb protein was immunoprecipitated from cells, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by reverse phase HPLC (Fig. 1A). There are both increases (Fig. 1A, up arrows) and decreases (Fig. 1A, down arrows) in the intensities of 32P-labeled tryptic peptides generated by digestion of c-Myb immunoprecipitated from cells treated with hyperthermia as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that cellular stresses, as exemplified by hyperthermia, induce rapid changes in phosphorylation of c-Myb. Next we decided to assess the phosphoamino acids content in c-Myb isolated from cells treated or not treated with stress. Because we wanted to investigate a possible relation between phosphorylation and SUMOylation, we decided to also compare phosphorylation of unmodified and SUMO-2 modified c-Myb treated with hyperthermia or untreated. To increase the amount of SUMOylation of c-Myb, COS-7 cell were cotransfected with constructs encoding both c-Myb and SUMO-2. Cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and either stressed (43 °C) or not stressed (37 °C) with hyperthermia for another 30 min and lysed. NonSUMOylated and SUMOylated c-Myb forms were immunoprecipitated, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to the membrane, and analyzed by direct exposure to x-ray film. As expected, heat stress induced a strong increase in SUMO-2 conjugation to c-Myb (34Sramko M. Markus J. Kabát J. Wolff L. Bies J. Stress-induced inactivation of the c-Myb transcription factor through conjugation of SUMO-2/3 proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40065-40075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Immobilized 32P-labeled c-Myb was hydrolyzed, and phosphoamino acid analysis was performed. There was an apparent increase in the phosphorylation of Thr residues in the nonSUMOylated form of c-Myb isolated from hyperthermia-treated cells as compared with cells growing under physiological conditions (Fig. 1C). Quantitative analysis of the phosphoamino acid content on TLC plates revealed that the amount of phosphorylated Thr in nonSUMOylated c-Myb isolated from stressed cells increased significantly (Thr(P) contents 29%) as compared with that from unstressed cells (Thr(P) 11%) (Fig. 1C). However, when we compared phosphoamino acid composition of nonSUMOylated and SUMOylated c-Myb protein isolated from stressed cells, we detected a decrease in Thr phosphorylation in the SUMOylated form (Thr(P) contents 18%) as compared with the nonSUMOylated form (Thr(P) 28%) of c-Myb (Fig. 1D).

https://openalex.org/W1973316463,"We identify and explain the mechanisms that account for the emergence of fairness preferences and altruistic punishment in voluntary contribution mechanisms by combining an evolutionary perspective together with an expected utility model. We aim at filling a gap between the literature on the theory of evolution applied to cooperation and punishment, and the empirical findings from experimental economics. The approach is motivated by previous findings on other-regarding behavior, the co-evolution of culture, genes and social norms, as well as bounded rationality. Our first result reveals the emergence of two distinct evolutionary regimes that force agents to converge either to a defection state or to a state of coordination, depending on the predominant set of self- or other-regarding preferences. Our second result indicates that subjects in laboratory experiments of public goods games with punishment coordinate and punish defectors as a result of an aversion against disadvantageous inequitable outcomes. Our third finding identifies disadvantageous inequity aversion as evolutionary dominant and stable in a heterogeneous population of agents endowed initially only with purely self-regarding preferences. We validate our model using previously obtained results from three independently conducted experiments of public goods games with punishment."
https://openalex.org/W1989746393,"A new treatable venous disorder, chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI), has been proposed in patients with multiple sclerosis. The natural course of CCSVI has not been examined yet. This is crucial given the fact that surgical procedures are increasingly offered to MS patients to treat venous stenosis.To document the natural course of venous haemodynamics we performed extra- and transcranial echo colour Doppler (ECD) in 52 multiple sclerosis patients and 28 healthy controls (HC) and re-examined this group after a median period of 16 weeks. The reexamination was done being blinded to the initial findings and the patients did not undergo any intervention.The ECD examination at baseline showed CCSVI in 5 (9.6%) of the 52 multiple sclerosis patients and 0 HC (P = 0.26). At follow-up the diagnosis CCSVI could not be reconfirmed in 3 out of 5 patients at follow-up, while 2 new CCSVI-positive multiple sclerosis patients were detected.ECD examination shows a fluctuating natural course of the extracranial venous haemodynamics, which makes determination of CCSVI by ECD examination unreliable."
https://openalex.org/W2081527587,"Erigeron breviscapus (Vant.) Hand.-Mazz. is an important, widely used Chinese herb with scutellarin, 1,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid and erigoster B being its major active compounds. We aimed to resolve the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on the concentrations of these compounds and to determine appropriate cultivation methods to improve the yields of the four compounds in this herb.In order to detect the major genetic and natural environmental factors affecting the yields of these four compounds, we applied AFLP markers to investigate the population genetic differentiation and HPLC to measure the concentrations of four major active compounds among 23 wild populations which were located across almost the entire distribution of this species in China. The meteorological data including annual average temperature, annual average precipitation and annual average hours of sunshine were collected. The relationships among the concentrations of four compounds and environmental factors and genetic differentiation were studied.Low intraspecific genetic differentiation is detected, and there is no obvious correlation between the genetic differentiation and the contents of the chemical compounds. We investigated the correlation between the concentrationsof four compounds (scutellarin, 1,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid and erigoster B) and environmental factors. Concentrations of two compounds (1,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid and 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid) were correlated with environmental factors. The concentration of 1,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid is positively correlated with latitude, and is negatively correlated with the annual average temperature. The concentration of 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid is positively correlated with annual average precipitation. Therefore, changing cultivation conditions may significantly improve the yields of these two compounds. We found the concentration of scutellarin positively correlated with that of erigoster B and 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, respectively. We inferred that the synthesis of these two pairs of compounds may share similar triggering mechanism as they synthesized in a common pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2020684656,"At the individual level, to be behaviourally lateralized avoids costly duplication of neural circuitry and decreases possible contradictory order from the two brain hemispheres. However, being prey behaviour lateralized at higher hierarchical levels could generate different negative implications, especially if predators are able to make predictions after multiple encounters. These conflicting pressures, namely between the advantages for individuals and the disadvantages for populations could be concealed if higher-level lateralization would arise from the combination of lateralized behaviours of individuals which are mutually dependent. Here, we investigated the lateralization patterns in the escape behaviour of the gecko Tarentola angustimentalis undergoing a predatory attack simulation in a ""T"" maze experiment. Results showed that gecko populations displayed different degrees of lateralization, with an overall dominance of right-biased individuals. This trend is similar to that observed in the Podarcis wall lizards, which share predators with Tarentola. In addition, different morphological parameters plausible to affect refuge selection were explored in order to link directional asymmetries at morphological level with lateralization during refuge selection."
https://openalex.org/W2170445857,"The effects of ethanol on neuronal network activity were studied in dissociated cultures of rat hippocampus. Exposure to low (0.25-0.5%) ethanol concentrations caused an increase in synchronized network spikes, and a decrease in the duration of individual spikes. Ethanol also caused an increase in rate of miniature spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents. Higher concentrations of ethanol eliminated network spikes. These effects were reversible upon wash. The effects of the high, but not the low ethanol were blocked by the GABA antagonist bicuculline. The enhancing action of low ethanol was blocked by apamin, an SK potassium channel antagonist, and mimicked by 1-EBIO, an SK channel opener. It is proposed that in cultured hippocampal networks low concentration of ethanol is associated with SK channel activity, rather than the GABAergic receptor."
