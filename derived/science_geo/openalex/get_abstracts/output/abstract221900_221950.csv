https://openalex.org/W2165702945,"Human institutions--ways of organizing activities--affect the resilience of the environment. Locally evolved institutional arrangements governed by stable communities and buffered from outside forces have sustained resources successfully for centuries, although they often fail when rapid change occurs. Ideal conditions for governance are increasingly rare. Critical problems, such as transboundary pollution, tropical deforestation, and climate change, are at larger scales and involve nonlocal influences. Promising strategies for addressing these problems include dialogue among interested parties, officials, and scientists; complex, redundant, and layered institutions; a mix of institutional types; and designs that facilitate experimentation, learning, and change."
https://openalex.org/W2044896348,"The proposition that natural resources need protection from the destructive actions of people is widely accepted. Yet communities have shown in the past and increasingly today that they can collaborate for long-term resource management. The term social capital captures the idea that social bonds and norms are critical for sustainability. Where social capital is high in formalized groups, people have the confidence to invest in collective activities, knowing that others will do so too. Some 0.4 to 0.5 million groups have been established since the early 1990s for watershed, forest, irrigation, pest, wildlife, fishery, and microfinance management. These offer a route to sustainable management and governance of common resources."

Recently, crop yield has fallen in many areas because of declining investments in research and infrastructure, as well as increasing water scarcity. Climate change and HIV/AIDS are also crucial factors affecting food security in many regions. Although agroecological approaches offer some promise for improving yields, food security in developing countries could be substantially improved by increased investment and policy reforms."

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a functional receptor for the coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV) that causes SARS. Here we demonstrate that a 193-amino acid fragment of the S protein (residues 318–510) bound ACE2 more efficiently than did the full S1 domain (residues 12–672). Smaller S protein fragments, expressing residues 327–510 or 318–490, did not detectably bind ACE2. A point mutation at aspartic acid 454 abolished association of the full S1 domain and of the 193-residue fragment with ACE2. The 193-residue fragment blocked S protein-mediated infection with an IC50 of less than 10 nm, whereas the IC50 of the S1 domain was ∼50 nm.

SARS-CoV does not belong to any of the three previously defined genetic and serological coronavirus groups; the SARS-CoV S protein, a surface glycoprotein that mediates coronavirus entry into receptor-bearing cells, is also distinct from those of other coronaviruses (5Marra M.A. Jones S.J.

Reflecting this difference, SARS-CoV does not utilize any previously identified coronavirus receptors to infect cells. Rather, as we have recently demonstrated, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as a functional receptor for this coronavirus (7Li W. Moore M.J. Vasilieva N. Sui J. Wong S.K.

The S proteins of some coronaviruses, for example, that of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), can be cleaved into two subunits (S1 and S2) (8Sturman L.S. Holmes K.V. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1984; 173: 25-35Google Scholar, 9Jackwood M.W. Hilt D.A. Callison S.A. Lee C.W. Plaza H. Wade E. Avian Dis. 2001; 45: 366-372Google Scholar). The S proteins of other coronaviruses, such as those of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and SARS-CoV, are not cleaved by the virus-producing cell (10Gallagher T.M. Buchmeier M.J. Virology. 2001; 279: 371-374Google Scholar). Nonetheless, S1 and S2 domains of these latter S proteins can be identified through their homology with the S1 and S2 subunits of cleaved coronavirus S proteins. The S1 domain of all characterized coronaviruses, including that of SARS-CoV, mediates an initial high affinity interaction with a cellular receptor (11Bonavia A. Zelus B.D. Wentworth D.E.

Independently folded receptor-binding domains of two coronaviruses have been described. The first 330 amino acids of the 769-residue S1 subunit of the MHV S protein is sufficient to bind carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), the cellular receptor for MHV (13Kubo H.

A very different region of the S1 domain of HCoV-229E, between residues 407 and 547, is sufficient to associate with the cellular receptor for this coronavirus, aminopeptidase N (APN, CD13) (11Bonavia A. Zelus B.D. Wentworth D.E. Talbot P.J. Holmes K.V. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2530-2538Google Scholar, 12Breslin J.J. Mork I. Smith M.K. Vogel L.K. Hemmila E.M. Bonavia A. Talbot P.J. Sjostrom H. Noren O.

Here we show that a 193-amino acid fragment of the SARS-CoV S protein, residues 318–510, binds the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 and blocks S protein-mediated infection more efficiently than does the full-length S1 domain. This region includes seven cysteines, five of which are essential for expression or ACE2 association. Point mutations within this domain, at glutamic acid 452 or aspartic acid 454, interfere with or abolish association with ACE2. These data identify a domain of the SARS-CoV S protein that may be a critical target for neutralizing antibodies against the virus. Construction of S1-Ig, Truncation Variants, and Mutants—A plasmid encoding S1-Ig was generated by amplifying a region encoding residues 12–672 from an expression vector containing a codon-optimized form of the full-length S protein gene (7Li W. Moore M.J. Vasilieva N. Sui J. Wong S.K. Berne M.A. Somasundaran M. Sullivan J.L. Luzeriaga C. Greenough T.C. Choe H. Farzan M. Nature. 2003; 426: 450-454Google Scholar) and ligating this region into a previously described vector encoding the signal sequence of CD5 and the Fc domain of human IgG1 (17Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Google Scholar). Truncation variants were generated by inverse PCR amplification, using the S1-Ig plasmid as a template. Mutations within S1-Ig, or within a truncation mutant thereof expressing residues 318–510, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). Two independent plasmids were generated for each variant, sequenced within their coding regions and assayed. Purification of S1 Protein Variants—293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding S1-Ig or S1-Ig variants. One day post-transfection, cells were washed in PBS and subsequently incubated in 293 SFM II medium (Invitrogen). Medium was harvested after 48 h and proteins precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 16 h. Beads were washed in PBS, 0.5 M NaCl, eluted with 50 mm sodium citrate/50 mm glycine (pH 2), and neutralized with NaOH. Purified proteins were concentrated with Centricon filters (Amicon) and dialyzed in PBS. Binding and Flow Cytometry—293T cells were transfected with a previously described plasmid encoding ACE2 (7Li W. Moore M.J. Vasilieva N. Sui J. Wong S.K. Berne M.A. Somasundaran M. Sullivan J.L. Luzeriaga C. Greenough T.C. Choe H. Farzan M. Nature. 2003; 426: 450-454Google Scholar) or with vector (pcDNA3.1, Invitrogen) alone. Three days post-transfection, cells were detached in PBS, 5 mm EDTA and washed with PBS, 0.5% BSA. S1-Ig or variants thereof were added to 106 cells to a final concentration of 250 nm, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS, 0.5% BSA, then incubated for 30 min on ice with anti-human IgG FITC conjugate (Sigma; 1:50 dilution). Cells were again washed with PBS, 0.5% BSA. Binding of IgG-tagged viral proteins to 293T cells transfected with ACE2-expressing plasmid was detected by flow cytometry. The mean value of the binding of S1-Ig or variants with the ACE2-transfected cells was subtracted from that of the mock-transfected cells and normalized to that of S1-Ig. Immunoprecipitation of Soluble ACE2—293T cells transfected with a previously described plasmid expressing soluble ACE2 (7Li W. Moore M.J. Vasilieva N. Sui J. Wong S.K. Berne M.A. Somasundaran M. Sullivan J.L. Luzeriaga C. Greenough T.C. Choe H. Farzan M. Nature. 2003; 426: 450-454Google Scholar) were metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine and -methionine. Labeled medium was harvested 3 days post-transfection. 0.5 ml of soluble ACE2-containing medium was incubated for 15 min on ice with 25 pmol of purified S1-Ig or variants, to a final concentration of 50 nm. 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added to the mixture, which was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Protein A-Sepharose beads were washed three times with PBS, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and once with PBS. Protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and quantified by phosphorimaging using ImageQuant software. Infection Assay with S Protein-Pseudotyped Virus—–293T cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding SARS-CoV S protein or VSV-G, together with a previously described plasmid encoding the genome of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), modified by deletion of the env gene and by replacement of the nef gene with that for green fluorescent protein (GFP) (18Bannert N. Schenten D. Craig S. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10984-10993Google Scholar). Supernatants of transfected cells were harvested, and viral reverse transcriptase activity was measured. Supernatants containing S protein- or VSV-G-pseudotyped SIV were added to ACE2- or mock-transfected 293T cells in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of S1-Ig or of the 12–327 or 318–510 variants thereof. Media were changed the following day and GFP expression in infected cells was measured 2 days later by flow cytometry. A protein in which the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV S protein was fused to the Fc region of human IgG1 has been shown to associate with ACE2-expressing cells and to precipitate ACE2 (7Li W. Moore M.J. Vasilieva N. Sui J. Wong S.K. Berne M.A. Somasundaran M. Sullivan J.L. Luzeriaga C. Greenough T.C. Choe H. Farzan M. Nature. 2003; 426: 450-454Google Scholar). To identify the receptor-binding domain of the S protein, this fusion protein, S1-Ig, was sequentially deleted at the N and C termini of the S1 domain to make a total of 12 additional variants. Each variant expressed efficiently and could be readily purified using protein A-Sepharose beads (Fig. 1A, top). S1-Ig and truncation variants thereof were used to precipitate a metabolically labeled and soluble form of ACE2. In contrast to an analogous MHV S protein truncation variant, which efficiently binds the MHV receptor CEACAM1 (13Kubo H. Yamada Y.K. Taguchi F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5403-5410Scopus (0) Google Scholar), the S1-Ig variant containing S1 domain residues 12–327 did not associate with ACE2. Neither did another expressing residues 12–481, whereas variants expressing residues 12–510 and 12–572 efficiently bound soluble ACE2 (Fig. 1A). These data indicate that residues 511–672 at the C terminus of the S1 domain do not contribute significantly to ACE2 association. Removal of residues 12–260 from the S1-Ig N terminus had no effect on ACE2 association (Fig. 1A). Variants expressing residues 298–510 and 318–510 efficiently bound S protein. The 318–510 variant precipitated ACE2 more efficiently than did the full S1 domain. However, two variants expressing slightly smaller fragments of the S1 domain (residues 318–490 and 327–510) did not detectably precipitate ACE2. These data imply that some residues from 318 to 326 and from 491 to 509 contribute either directly to the association of the S1 domain with ACE2 or to the correct folding of the receptor-binding domain. Fig. 1B compares the ability of each S1-Ig truncation variant to precipitate soluble ACE2 over several experiments (gray bars) with its ability to bind ACE2-expressing 293T cells, as measured by flow cytometry (black bars). A good correlation is observed between these two binding assays. We note that, under conditions used here, flow cytometry more sensitively detects low affinity associations with ACE2, whereas precipitation better reveals differences among efficiently binding variants. The truncation variants assayed in Fig. 1, A and B, are represented in Fig. 1C. We further examined the ability of the S1-Ig variant containing residues 318–510 to bind ACE2 with higher affinity than does full-length S1-Ig. A 50 nm concentration of S1-Ig was compared with varying concentrations of the 318–510 variant. As shown in Fig. 2A, the same concentration (50 nm) of 318–510 precipitated more than twice as much ACE2 as did S1-Ig. A 25 nm concentration of 318–510 precipitated the same amount of soluble ACE2 as did 50 nm S1-Ig. The results of two such experiments are summarized in Fig. 2B. These data imply that the 318–510 variant binds ACE2 at least twice as efficiently as does S1-Ig. We also investigated the ability of S1-Ig and the 318–510 variant to block S protein-mediated infection. To do so, we utilized a system we recently developed in which a lentivirus expressing green fluorescent protein and pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV S protein infects 293T cells stably expressing ACE2. 2M. J. Moore, T. Dorfman, W. Li, S. K. Wong, T. C. Greenough, M. Farzan, and H. Choe, manuscript in preparation. Incubation of 293T cells with the 12–327 variant had no effect on infection, consistent with the inability of this variant to bind ACE2 (Fig. 2C). In this assay, S1-Ig inhibited infection by S protein-pseudotyped lentivirus with an IC50 of ∼50 nm, whereas the 318–510 variant blocked infection by the same virus with an IC50 of less than 10 nm (Fig. 2C). The 318–510 variant did not substantially interfere with infection of lentivirus pseudotyped with the VSV-G protein, which mediates entry independently of ACE2 (Fig. 2C). Fig. 2D displays fluorescent microscopic fields of view in the presence of 250 nm of the 12–327 or 318–510 variants. Many fields lacked observable green cells in the presence of the 318–510 variant. We asked whether the difference in the abilities of the 318–510 and 327–510 variants to bind ACE2 was a consequence of the loss of cysteine 323 in the latter variant. Fig. 3A demonstrates that this is not the case. A series of point mutations was made in which each of the seven cysteines within 318–510 was altered to alanine. The variant in which cysteine 323 was altered bound ACE2 as efficiently as 318–510 itself. Alteration of cysteine 378 also had little effect on binding; however, a combination of mutations at residues 323 and 378 resulted in a construct with decreased ability to bind ACE2 (Fig. 3A, right panel). Alteration of cysteine 366 or 419 substantially impaired expression of the 318–510 variant. Similar alterations of cysteines 348, 467, and 474 prevented efficient precipitation of ACE2 without a major effect on expression. These data indicate that determinants between 318 and 326 other than cysteine 323 contribute directly or indirectly to ACE2 association. Finally, we explored the ability of some acidic residues between 318 and 510 to contribute to ACE2 association, focusing on a region highly divergent among coronavirus S proteins. Glutamic acid 452 and aspartic acids 454, 463, and 480 were individually altered to alanine in the 318–510 variant (E452A, D454A, D463A, and D480A, respectively). These 318–510 variants were assayed for their ability to bind ACE2 (Fig. 3B, left panel). No effect was observed with the D480A alteration. The D454A and E452A 318–510 variants precipitated ∼1 and 10%, respectively, of the ACE2 precipitated by the wild-type 318–510 variant. The full S1 domain, when mutated at E452, precipitated ACE2 with an efficiency similar to that of the 318–510 variant bearing the same mutation (Fig. 3B, right panel). The D454A alteration completely abolished ACE2 association both in the 318–510 variant (Fig. 3B, left panel) and in the full-length S1 domain (Fig. 3B, right panel), without affecting expression of either protein. These data suggest that ACE2 interacts with the SARS-CoV S domain in the vicinity of aspartic acid 454. Fig. 3C represents the 318–510 region within the SARS-CoV S protein, aligned with the S proteins of HCoV-229E and MHV. As is apparent from this figure, each of the receptor-binding domains of these S proteins is found in a different region of the S1 domain, consistent with the fact that each of these coronaviruses belongs to a distinct serological and genetic group. The studies described here localize the SARS CoV S protein receptor-binding domain. A series of truncation variants of the S1 domain, fused to the Fc region of human IgG1, were assayed for their ability to associate with ACE2 on the surface of transfected cells and to immunoprecipitate soluble ACE2. The smallest fragment that retained ACE2 association was composed of residues 318–510 and bound ACE2 more efficiently than did the full-length S1 domain, whereas slightly smaller fragments did not. The higher affinity of the 193-residue fragment raises the possibility that other regions of the S protein partially mask this receptor-binding domain. Alternatively, the receptor-binding domain described here may simply be more soluble or better folded than the S1 protein, which includes regions that may contact the S2 domain or other S proteins in the trimeric complex. The 193-amino acid receptor-binding region also more efficiently blocked S protein-mediated infection of ACE2-expressing cells than did the full S1 domain, presumably due to its greater affinity for ACE2. Further study of this fragment may therefore provide insight into development of therapeutics that block SARS-CoV infection. We also investigated the role of cysteines and some acidic residues within the 193-residue fragment. We found that most of the seven cysteines contributed to expression or to ACE2 association and were unable to immediately identify non-essential or unpaired cysteines within this variant. Work in this direction continues. We did, however, identify two acidic residues, glutamic acid 452 and aspartic acid 454, that appear to make an important contribution to S1 protein interaction with ACE2. Although conformational changes due to alteration of these residues cannot be excluded, the observations that variants containing these mutations expressed as efficiently as those bearing wild-type sequences, and that these mutations had nearly identical effects on the 318–510 variant and the full-length S1 domain, suggest that one or both of these residues contribute directly to ACE2 association. At this time, public health measures have successfully controlled transmission of SARS-CoV, but it remains unclear whether SARS will reemerge as a threat to human health. Fortunately, several observations suggest that the development of a vaccine against this virus will be less challenging than, for example, the development of an anti-HIV-1 vaccine. SARS-CoV is transmitted more rapidly than an anti-viral antibody response can develop; this suggests that, in contrast to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, the S protein may do little to cloak its receptor-binding domain. Consistent with this relative exposure of the ACE2-binding region, SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies that compete for S protein association with ACE2 have already been identified. 3J. Sui, personal communication. Also, again in contrast to HIV-1, and due either to the fidelity of the RNA polymerase or to the rate of transmission, surprisingly little variation has been observed in S protein genes obtained from separate patients. Together, these observations suggest that a subunit vaccine that includes the S protein receptor-binding domain described here may be effective in the control of virus transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2089259767,"Derived features of a new boreosphenidan mammal from the Lower Cretaceous Yixian Formation of China suggest that it has a closer relationship to metatherians (including extant marsupials) than to eutherians (including extant placentals). This fossil dates to 125 million years ago and extends the record of marsupial relatives with skeletal remains by 50 million years. It also has many foot structures known only from climbing and tree-living extant mammals, suggesting that early crown therians exploited diverse niches. New data from this fossil support the view that Asia was likely the center for the diversification of the earliest metatherians and eutherians during the Early Cretaceous."

https://openalex.org/W2125863213,"A potential role for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in human oncogenesis was first suggested by the observation that LPA is present at elevated levels in ascites of ovarian cancer patients. In the current study, we demonstrated that LPA is a potent inducer of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) production in ovarian cancer cells. Both IL-6 and IL-8 have been implicated in ovarian cancer progression. We characterized the IL-8 gene promoter to ascertain the transcriptional mechanism underlying LPA -induced expression of these cytokines. LPA stimulated the transcriptional activity of the IL-8 gene with little effect on IL-8 mRNA stability. The optimal response of the IL-8 gene promoter to LPA relied on binding sites for NF-κB and AP-1, two transcription factors that were strongly activated by LPA in ovarian cancer cell lines. Positive regulators of the NF-κB and AP-1 pathways synergistically activated the IL-8 gene promoter. Further, the effect of LPA on IL-6 and IL-8 generation is mediated by the Edg LPA receptors as enforced expression of LPA receptors restored LPA-induced IL-6 and IL-8 production in non-responsive cells and enhanced the sensitivity to LPA in responsive cell lines. The LPA2 receptor was identified to be the most efficient in linking LPA to IL-6 and IL-8 production although LPA1 and LPA3 were also capable of increasing the response to a certain degree. These studies elucidate the transcriptional mechanism and the Edg LPA receptors involved in LPA-induced IL-6 and IL-8 production and suggest potential strategies to restrain the expression of these cytokines in ovarian cancer. A potential role for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in human oncogenesis was first suggested by the observation that LPA is present at elevated levels in ascites of ovarian cancer patients. In the current study, we demonstrated that LPA is a potent inducer of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) production in ovarian cancer cells. Both IL-6 and IL-8 have been implicated in ovarian cancer progression. We characterized the IL-8 gene promoter to ascertain the transcriptional mechanism underlying LPA -induced expression of these cytokines. LPA stimulated the transcriptional activity of the IL-8 gene with little effect on IL-8 mRNA stability. The optimal response of the IL-8 gene promoter to LPA relied on binding sites for NF-κB and AP-1, two transcription factors that were strongly activated by LPA in ovarian cancer cell lines. Positive regulators of the NF-κB and AP-1 pathways synergistically activated the IL-8 gene promoter.

However, the exact role of LPA in human oncogenesis, particularly in vivo, remains poorly understood. It has been recently reported that LPA and other phospholipids stimulate expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) in ovarian cancer cell lines (12Schwartz B.M. Hong G. Morrison B.H. Wu W. Baudhuin L.M. Xiao Y.J. Mok S.C. Xu Y. Gynecol. Oncol. 2001; 81: 291-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in ovarian cancer patients, serum levels of IL-8 and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are elevated (13Penson R.T. Kronish K. Duan Z. Feller A.J. Stark P. Cook S.E. Duska L.R. Fuller A.F.

Zeillinger R. Leodolter S. Joura E.A. Kainz C. Cancer. 2001; 91: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The concentrations of IL-8 and IL-6 are several magnitudes higher in ascitic fluid than in serum (13Penson R.T. Kronish K. Duan Z. Feller A.J. Stark P. Cook S.E. Duska L.R. Fuller A.F. Goodman A.K.

Cancer. 2000; 10: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), implying that IL-8 and IL-6 are produced in ascites, probably by cancer cells, and migrate from the peritoneal cavity to the circulation similar to other tumor markers such as CA125 (16Fritsche H.A. Bast Jr., R.C. Clin. Chem. 1998; 44: 1379-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Further, high concentrations of IL-8 and IL-6 in ovarian cancer correlate with poor initial response to chemotherapy and with poor prognosis, respectively (13Penson R.T. Kronish K. Duan Z. Feller A.J. Stark P. Cook S.E. Duska L.R. Fuller A.F. Goodman A.K. Nikrui N. MacNeill K.M. Matulonis U.A. Preffer F.I. Seiden M.V. Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer. 2000; 10: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In animal models, expression of IL-8 and other growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is associated with increased tumorigenicity, ascites formation, angiogenesis, and invasiveness of ovarian cancer cells (17Yoneda Y. Kuniyasu H. Crispens M.A. Price J.E. Bucana C.D. Fidler I.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 18Huang S. Robinson J.B. Deguzman A. Bucana C.D. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5334-5339PubMed Google Scholar). Development of the drug-resistant phenotype in ovarian cancer cell lines is accompanied by overexpression of IL-8 and IL-6 (19Lee L.F. Schuerer-Maly C.C. Lofquist A.K. van Haaften-Day C. Ting J.P. White C.M. Martin B.K. Haskill J.S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1303-1308PubMed Google Scholar, 20Duan Z. Feller A.J. Penson R.T. Chabner B.A. Seiden M.V. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 3445-3453PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that IL-8 and IL-6 are important modulators of cancer progression, drug resistance, and prognosis in ovarian cancer. The prominent ability of LPA to stimulate expression of IL-8 in ovarian cancer cells highlights the possibility that elevated levels of IL-8 seen in ovarian cancer patients are attributable to LPA that co-localizes with tumor cells in the ascitic fluid of ovarian cancer patients (3Xu Y. Gaudette D. Boynton J.D Frankel A. Fang X. Sharma A. Hurteau J. Casey G. Goodbody A. Mellors A. Holub B.J. Mills G.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 1223-1232PubMed Google Scholar, 4Xu Y. Shen Z.

Therefore, it is of particular interest to investigate the mechanism by which LPA induces IL-8 expression in ovarian cancer cells. In the current study, we showed that LPA-induced expression of both IL-8 and IL-6 in ovarian cancer cells. LPA stimulated increases in mRNA levels of these cytokines due to transcriptional activation with limited increases in mRNA stability. We characterized the IL-8 gene promoter (21Mahe Y. Mukaida N.

Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by luciferase assays and identified a fragment 133-bp upstream of the transcription initiation site responsible for the full response to LPA. The region harbors binding sites for the transcription factors AP-1, NF-IL-6, and NF-κB (21Mahe Y. Mukaida N. Kuno K. Akiyama M. Ikeda N. Matsushima K. Murakami S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13759-13763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Xu L. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4610-4616PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion and mutation analyses of the sequence indicated that the optimal response to LPA relied on binding sites for NF-κB and AP-1. In ovarian cancer cell lines, LPA potently stimulated NF-κB and AP-1 transcriptional activity as determined by luciferase assays using synthetic NF-κB or AP-1-responsive promoters. Co-expression of positive regulators of the NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors was sufficient to stimulate the transcriptional activity of the IL-8 gene promoter in ovarian cancer cells. Further, the effect of LPA on IL-6 and IL-8 expression is mediated through the Edg LPA receptors (24Fukushima N. Chun J. Prostaglandins. 2001; 64: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 25Goetzl E.Z. An S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 469: 259-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Chun J. Goetzl E.J. Hla T. Igarashi Y. Lynch K.R. Moolenaar W. Pyne S. Tigyi G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The LPA2 receptor was found to be the most efficient in coupling LPA to IL-6 and IL-8 production although LPA1 and LPA3 could also mediate the response to a certain degree. Reagents—LPA (myristoyl, palmitoyl, and oleoyl) and phosphatidic acid (PA, dipalmitoyl) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Before use, these phospholipids were dissolved in PBS containing 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Roche Applied Science). PDGF, epidermal growth factor (EGF), fetal bovine serum (FBS), actinomycin D, and anti-FLAG M2 and anti-β-actin monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Sigma. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-phospho Erk antibody and luciferase reaction kits were purchased from Promega. Anti-phospho Akt (Ser-473) antibody was from Cell Signaling. Anti-V5 monoclonal antibody was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). The pharmacological inhibitors of signal transduction pathways (PD98059, SP600125, SB203580, and wortmannin) were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Cells—The source and maintenance of ovarian cancer cell lines including OVCAR-3, SKOV-3, Dov-13, HEY, OVCA432, Caov-3, and A2780CP have been described previously (27Fang X. Jin X.M. Xu H.J. Liu L. Hogg D. Yu Y. Roth J. Xu F.J. Bast Jr., R.C. Mills G.B. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The human breast carcinoma cell lines BT549 and SKBr-3 were obtained from ATCC. MDA468 was provided by Dr. Y. Yu (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center). Breast cancer cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 plus 10% FBS. All cell lines were frozen at early passages and used for less than 10 weeks in continuous culture. Measurement of IL6 and IL-8 Production by ELISA—Culture supernatants of cell lines treated without or with LPA or other ligands were collected and analyzed for IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations by ELISA using the Quantikine IL-6 or IL-8 ELISA kits (R&D Systems). Concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 in the supernatants were calculated by comparing the absorbance of samples to standard curves. Western Blot—Cells were lysed in ice-cold X-100 lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Total cellular protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon (polyvinylidene difluoride), and immunoblotted with antibodies following the protocols provided by manufacturers. Immunocomplexes were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Northern Blot Analysis—Total cellular RNA and poly(A)+ RNA were extracted from cultured cells using the TRIzol Reagent and the FastTrack 2.0 mRNA Isolation kit, respectively, following the instructions of the supplier (Invitrogen). RNA samples were size-fractionated by formaldehyde/agarose-gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and transferred to N+ hybrid nylon. RNA was immobilized by UV cross-linking, and then prehybridized and hybridized to 32P-labeled cDNA probes as described previously (27Fang X. Jin X.M. Xu H.J. Liu L. Hogg D. Yu Y. Roth J. Xu F.J. Bast Jr., R.C. Mills G.B. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The human LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3 cDNAs were isolated from expression vectors. The cDNA clones for the human IL-6 (28Van Snick J. Cayphas S. Szikora J.P. Renauld J.C. Van Roost E. Boon T Simpson R.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and IL-8 (29Matsushima K. Oppenheim J. Cytokine. 1989; 1: 2-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) genes were from ATCC. Quality of RNA samples was confirmed by re-hybridization to the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA or to the DNA of 18 S rRNA obtained from the ATCC. mRNA Stability Assay—DOV-13 cells were grown to subconfluence and starved for 14 h. The cells were then stimulated for 4 h in serum-free medium with or without 10 μm LPA before addition of actinomycin D (5 μg/ml). Total cellular RNA was prepared at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after addition of actinomycin D and examined by Northern blot analysis as described above. The intensity of IL-8 mRNA hybridization bands was quantified by densitometry. Plasmids, Transfection, and Luciferase Assays—The LPA1 receptor expression vector, pcDNA3-FLAG-LPA1 (30Zondag G.C. Postma F.R. Etten I.V. Verlaan I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), was provided by Dr. W. H. Moolenaar (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). LPA2 and LPA3 cDNAs were obtained from OVCAR-3 cells by RT-PCR and inserted into pcDNA3 that had been pre-modified to contain the FLAG M2 DNA sequence located at the 5′-terminal of genes to be inserted. The structures of pcDNA-Flag-LPA1, pcDNA3Flag-LPA2 and pcDNA3Flag-LPA3 vectors were confirmed by automatic sequencing. The luciferase vectors containing various lengths or mutants of the IL-8 promoter (22Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Xu L. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4610-4616PubMed Google Scholar) were gifts of Dr. I. J. Fidler (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center). The NF-κB-responsive luciferase vector pNF-κB-Luc was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The AP-1-responsive luciferase vector p3xTRE-TK-Luc was constructed as we described previously (31Fang X. Gibson S.B. Flowers M. Furui T. Bast Jr., R.C. Mills G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13683-13689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To generate mammalian expression vectors for c-Jun and RelA/p65, the mouse c-Jun cDNA (32Lamph W.W. Wamsley P. Sassone-Corsi P. Verma I.M. Nature. 1988; 334: 629-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) (obtained by RT-PCR from Swiss 3T3 cells) and the human RelA/p65 cDNA (33Chiao P.J. Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) (obtained from Dr. P. Chiao, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center) were placed under the control of the CMV promoter of the pcDNA3 expression vector. For luciferase assays, ovarian cancer cell lines were transfected with luciferase reporter constructs using FuGENE 6 according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). About 60 h after transfection, cells were starved for 48 h before stimulation with LPA or vehicle for 6 h. Cell extracts were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity using a kit from Promega. The luciferase activity was normalized on the basis of the activity of cotransfected β-galactosidase reporter driven by the CMV promoter (pCMVβ-gal). Alternatively, fold increases in luciferase activity were normalized by subtracting LPA-induced nonspecific activity increases in cells transfected with pGL2-Luc in which the luciferase reporter is driven by the constitutive SV40 promoter. Restoration of LPA-induced IL-6 and IL-8 Production in SKBr-3—To determine whether enforced expression of LPA receptors can restore cytokine production in response to LPA, the non-responsive cell line SKBr-3 was transfected with each LPA receptor expression vector with LipofectAMINE™ 2000 according to the protocol of the supplier (Invitrogen). Approximately 60 h after transfection, cells were serum starved for 36 h prior to stimulation with LPA for 24 h. The conditioned medium was harvested for ELISA analysis of IL-6 and IL-8. In addition, SKBr-3 cells were co-transfected with each LPA receptor along with a GFP vector (pEGFP, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Two days after transfection, cells expressing high levels of GFP were isolated by FACS (FACScalibur; Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) and replated. Subsequent examination under fluorescence microscope indicated that >90% of the population was GFP-positive. These cells were starved and stimulated with LPA to determine the effect of LPA on Erk phosphorylation in SKBr-3 cells expressing exogenous LPA receptors. Immunofluorescent Staining—Transfected cells were grown on cover slips. Before staining, cells on the cover slips were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformadehyde. Cells were then blocked with 5% goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS for 1 h prior to incubation with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma, 4.5 μg/ml, 0.5% goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS) for 1 h. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig G (Dako Corp. Carpinteria, CA) was used as secondary antibody (1:140 in 0.5% goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS, 1 h). Percentages of positive cells were determined by counting more than 500 cells under fluorescent microscope. Generation of Lentivirus LPA Receptor Constructs and Infection of Cells—The ViralPower™ Lentiviral Expression System was obtained from Invitrogen. The system allows creation of a replication-incompetent, HIV-1-based lentivirus that can efficiently transduce mammalian cell lines (34Vigna E. Naldini L. J. Gene Med. 2000; 2: 308-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35O'Rourke J.P. Newbound G.C. Kohn D.B. Olsen J.C. Bunnell B.A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1510-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The cDNA of LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3 was amplified by PCR from their pcDNA3-based expression vectors. The PCR products were cloned into a Gateway entry vector (pENTR4) (Invitrogen) using NcoI and XhoI restriction sites. The viral constructs were made through homologous recombination between pENTR4-LPA1-3 and the lentiviral destination vector pLenti6/V5-DEST. In the resulting viral constructs, each of LPA receptors was tagged with V5 at the C-terminal. The downstream anti-blasticidin gene allows selection of transduced cells. The structures of the pLenti6-LPA1, pLenti6-LPA2, and plenti6-LPA3 as well as the control vector pLenti6-LacZ (provided by the Invitrogen kit) were confirmed by automatic sequencing. To generate high titer of viral stocks, 293FT cells were co-transfected (LipofectAMINE™ 2000) with the pLenti6-LPA vector (3 μg) and a mix (9 μg) of the three packaging plasmids (pLP1, pLP2, and pLP/VSVG), which supply in trans the structural and replication proteins required for production of the lentivirus. Approximately 72 h after the beginning of transfection, the supernatants were harvested, cleared by brief spin and stored at -80 °C. Ovarian cancer cell lines in 6-well or 12-well plates at around 50% confluence were incubated for 18 h with 1 ml or 0.75 ml of undiluted viral supernatants in the presence of polybrene (7.5 μg/ml). The infected cells were then kept in regular complete medium for 48 h. Before stimulation with LPA, the cells were starved overnight in serum-free medium. High efficiency of gene transduction by lentivirus in SKOV-3 cells was suggested by the resistance of the majority of the cells to blasticidin selection and the presence of high percentages of cells (>70%) stained positive for β-galactosidase activity in the pLenti6-LacZ virus-infected cells. Statistics—The significance of the results of luciferase assays was determined using the Student’s t test. LPA Induces Production of IL-6 and IL-8 in Ovarian Cancer Cells—Recent studies including our own indicate that, in ovarian cancer cells, LPA induces expression of certain genes, such as VEGF (36Hu Y.L.

These studies suggest that LPA may contribute to cancer progression through regulation of gene expression. As IL-8 and its related pro-inflammatory molecule IL-6 are important mediators of ovarian cancer (13Penson R.T. Kronish K. Duan Z. Feller A.J. Stark P. Cook S.E. Duska L.R. Fuller A.F. Goodman A.K.

In a number of ovarian carcinoma cell lines including OVCAR-3, SKOV-3, and DOV-13, LPA stimulates production of not only IL-8 but also IL-6 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). Overnight incubation of OVCAR-3 cells with 10 μm of LPA led to 50-100 fold increases in IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations in the culture supernatants as analyzed by ELISA. Since Dov-13 cells produce high basal levels of IL-6 and IL-8, fold increases in response to LPA is less dramatic than those observed in OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 cells. However, LPA-treated Dov-13 cells generated large quantities of IL-6 and IL-8 (ng/million cells). In OVCAR-3 and Dov-13 cells, the half-maximal effect dose of LPA is less than 1 μm (Fig. 1), suggesting the involvement of high affinity LPA receptors. LPA induced IL-6 and IL-8 generation in other ovarian cancer cell lines we evaluated (HEY, OVCA432, Caov-3 and A2780CP). In contrast, the breast cancer cell line SKBr-3 had minimal IL-6 and IL-8 production in response to LPA (Fig. 1). This, however, does not necessarily reflect a differential response to LPA between breast and ovarian cancer cells as other breast cancer cell lines such as BT549 and MDA468 do respond to LPA with IL-6 and IL-8 production (data not shown). We then compared the effects of different species of LPA, FBS and peptide growth factors on IL-6 and IL-8 production in OVCAR-3 cells (Fig. 2A). At 10 μm, myristoyl (14:0) and oleoyl (18:1) LPA are more potent than palmitoyl LPA (16:0) in stimulating IL-6 and IL-8 expression. Phosphatidic acid (PA, 16:0) demonstrated a much weaker stimulatory effect on IL-6 and IL-8 production (Fig. 2A). EGF had only marginal activity compared with LPA. In OVCAR-3 cells, the EGF receptor is expressed and functional as reflected by EGF-mediated activation of Erk and Akt (Fig. 2B). FBS contains multiple growth factors including LPA (38Eichholtz T.

Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Similar to LPA, FBS strongly induced IL-6 and IL-8 expression (Fig. 2A). However, peptide growth factors present in FBS, such as IGF-1 (Fig. 2A) and PDGF (data not shown), did not promote production of these cytokines by OVCAR-3 cells. OVCAR-3 cells lack functional receptors for IGF-1 and PDGF as suggested by the absence of signaling responses, such as activation of Erk and Akt, to IGF-1 and PDGF (Fig. 2B). SKOV-3 cells are also devoid of functional responses to IGF-1 and PDGF (data not shown). In human and murine fibroblast lines, IGF-1 and PDGF strongly activated Erk and Akt (data not shown), indicating that these peptide growth factors we used were biologically active. These observations suggest that the stimulation of IL-6 and IL-8 production in ovarian cancer cells is unique to LPA and is apparently not conferred by transactivation of EGF or PDGF receptors as proposed as mechanisms for other biological actions of LPA (41Hirota K.

We have identified two proline-rich, SH3 binding sites (PXXP) in the carboxyl-terminal tail of the human P2Y2 nucleotide receptor that directly associate with the tyrosine kinase Src in protein binding assays. Furthermore, Src co-precipitated with the P2Y2 receptor in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells stimulated with the P2Y2 receptor agonist UTP. A mutant P2Y2 receptor lacking the PXXP motifs was found to stimulate calcium mobilization and serine/threonine phosphorylation of the Erk1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases, like the wild-type receptor, but was defective in its ability to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of Src and Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. Dual immunofluorescence labeling of the P2Y2 receptor and the EGFR indicated that UTP caused an increase in the co-localization of these receptors in the plasma membrane that was prevented by the Src inhibitor PP2.

Although Src and Pyk2 activities are thought to be necessary for the transactivation of growth factor receptors by GPCRs, there are differing opinions in the literature about the role these kinases play in the activation of downstream mitogenic signaling. For example, inhibition of Src activity by cellular expression of C-terminal Src kinase was found to impair lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and β2-adrenergic receptor-mediated activation of MAP kinases in COS-7 cells (1Luttrell L.M.

And in PC12 cells, a dominant-negative mutant of Pyk2 and the EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478 inhibited GPCR-mediated MAP kinase activation (2Soltoff S.P. J. Biol.

In contrast, experiments performed with embryonic fibroblasts derived from Src-/-, Pyk2-/-, or Src-/-Pyk2-/- mice indicated that both Src and Pyk2 are essential for GPCR-mediated transactivation of the EGFR but are dispensable for GPCR-mediated activation of MAP kinases (3Andreev J.

In the present study, we have expressed wild-type and mutant P2Y2 nucleotide receptors in human 1321N1 astrocytoma cells to explore how this GPCR transactivates growth factor receptors and affects mitogenic signaling. The P2Y2 receptor is a Go/q-coupled receptor that is activated by extracellular ATP or UTP and is up-regulated in a variety of tissues in response to injury or stress (8Ahn J.S. Camden J.M. Schrader A.M. Redman R.S. Turner J.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C286-C294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Seye C.I. Kong Q. Erb L. Garrad R.C. Krugh B. Wang M. Turner J.T. Sturek M. Gonzalez F.A. Weisman G.A. Circulation. 2002; 106: 2720-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For example, expression of the P2Y2 receptor is dramatically increased in endothelial and smooth muscle cells by collar-induced stress to rabbit carotid arteries (9Seye C.I. Kong Q. Erb L. Garrad R.C. Krugh B. Wang M. Turner J.T. Sturek M. Gonzalez F.A. Weisman G.A. Circulation. 2002; 106: 2720-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in situ activation of the up-regulated P2Y2 receptor in collared arteries promotes intimal hyperplasia by increasing smooth muscle cell proliferation and leukocyte infiltration (9Seye C.I. Kong Q. Erb L. Garrad R.C. Krugh B. Wang M. Turner J.T. Sturek M. Gonzalez F.A. Weisman G.A. Circulation. 2002; 106: 2720-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of P2Y2 receptors in atherosclerosis, inflammation, wound repair, and mitogenesis is of great interest, and the regulation of this receptor is likely to become an important therapeutic target. The results of the present study demonstrate that two consensus SH3 binding sites in the carboxyl-terminal tail of the P2Y2 receptor bind directly to Src and are important for P2Y2 receptor-mediated activation of several tyrosine kinases, including Src, Pyk2, and the growth factor receptors, EGFR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), but not for other P2Y2 receptor-mediated responses, including intracellular calcium mobilization or activation of MAP kinases. Activation of the P2Y2 receptor also increased clustering of this receptor with the EGFR that was dependent upon Src kinase activity. These data suggest a mechanism for transactivation of the EGFR by the P2Y2 receptor involving agonist-induced binding of Src to the SH3 binding sites in the P2Y2 receptor. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human 1321N1 astrocytoma cells lacking endogenous P2 receptor activities (10Parr C.E. Sullivan D.M. Paradiso A.M. Lazarowski E.R. Burch L.H. Olsen J.C. Erb L.

Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 and 95% air. The retroviral vector pLXSN was used for stable expression of the various human P2Y2 receptor constructs in 1321N1 cells, as described previously (11Erb L. Garrad R. Wang Y. Quinn T. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4185-4188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of Human P2Y2Receptor cDNA—Two primers were synthesized in the DNA Core Facility of the University of Missouri-Columbia (primer 1, 5′-AGGCTCGTACGCTTTGCCCGAGATGCCAAGGCTCGCCGCAGGCTGGGCCTGCGCAGATC-3′; primer 2, 5′-CACACCCTAACTGACAC-3′) and were used to generate (by PCR) cDNA encoding the P2Y2 receptor deletion mutant. The PCR mixture contained 3.8 μl of each primer (final amount, 20 pmol), 10 μl of 10× Taq polymerase buffer with MgCl2 (Roche Applied Science), 2 ng of template DNA, 1 μl of TaqDNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science), 20 μl of dNTP mixture (0.2 mm final concentration each of dATP, dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP), and sterile distilled water in a final volume of 100 μl. The PCR parameters were: 30 cycles of 95 °C/1 min, 58 °C/1 min, and 72 °C/6 min. After verification of the PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis, the products were purified using the PCR Wizard kit (Amersham Biosciences), digested with BsiWI and BamHI and inserted into pLXSN. The mutant cDNA was verified by DNA sequencing. In Vitro Peptide Binding Assay—Three peptides were synthesized in the Protein Core Facility of the University of Missouri-Columbia. The Src binding peptide (RALPPLPRY) was reported to have high affinity for Src (Kd = 7.8 μm) (12Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). The P2Y2 PXXP peptide (AKPPTGPSPATPARRR) comprised the consensus SH3 binding sites in the carboxyl-terminal tail of the human P2Y2 receptor (amino acid numbers 320-335). The P2Y2 C-tail peptide (IGDVLGSSEDFRRTESTPAGSENTKD) comprised a sequence from the carboxyl-terminal tail of the human P2Y2 receptor that lacks the proline-rich region (amino acid numbers 349-374). Each peptide was coupled to activated CH-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's directions. Purified Src (Calbiochem) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 60 μl of 50% Sepharose slurry plus 200 μl of bovine serum albumin blocking solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% NaN3) and 800 μl of Cantley lysis buffer (4.5 m NaCl, 0.9 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 90 mm MgCl2, 90 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.0018% NaVO4). The next day, Sepharose-bound proteins were washed three times: first in washing buffer 1 (1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4), then in washing buffer 2 (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m LiCl), and finally in washing buffer 3 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). The proteins were solubilized by incubation for 1.5 min at 95 °C in 2× Laemmli's sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol. The proteins were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Src antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 1:400 dilution. Measurement of the Intracellular Calcium Concentration—The intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured by dual excitation spectrofluorometric analysis of cell suspensions loaded with fura-2 (Sigma), as described previously (13Lustig K.D. Erb L. Landis D.M. Hicks-Taylor C.S. Zhang X. Sportiello M.G. Weisman G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1134: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and cells were assayed in HEPES-buffered saline (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm glucose). Concentration-response data for UTP were analyzed with the Prism curve-fitting program (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Detection of Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Src, Erk1/2, Pyk2, EGFR, and PDGFR—Cells were grown to 80% confluence in 6-well tissue culture plates and incubated at 37 °C in medium without serum for 24 h before the experiments. After stimulation (as described in the figure legends), the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 0.3 ml of Laemmli's sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol. The lysates were heated in boiling water for 1.5 min, sonicated for 2 s, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting of phosphorylated proteins on the membranes was performed by incubation overnight at 4 °C in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl) containing 5% non-fat milk and 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Src (Tyr416) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), 1:1200 dilution of mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-Erk1/2 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Pyk2 (Tyr881) antibody (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA), 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-EGFR (Tyr992) antibody (Cell Signaling), or 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-PDGFR (Tyr716) antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Then, the nitrocellulose membranes were washed four times in TTBS (TBS containing 0.5% Tween 20), incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBS with 1:2000 dilution of HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG, and washed three times in TTBS. Tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were visualized on x-ray film with the Western blotting Luminol reagent system (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Chemiluminescent protein bands detected on x-ray films were quantitated by using a computer scanner and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). For normalization of the signals, the membranes were stripped of antibodies by incubation at 60 °C for 30 min in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS), washed with TTBS, reprobed with 1:3000 dilution of rabbit anti-Erk1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the proteins were visualized as above. Dual Fluorescence Labeling—Cells stably expressing amino-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged P2Y2 receptor constructs were grown to 60% confluence on coverslips in 35-mm dishes. Cells were serum-starved overnight followed by incubation with rabbit anti-HA antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and mouse anti-human EGFR antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with 1:200 dilution of goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor™ 594-conjugated IgG and goat anti-mouse Oregon Green™ 488-conjugated IgG antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in serum-free medium for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed in PBS and allowed to re-equilibrate in serum-free medium for 1 h prior to subsequent stimulation with 100 μm UTP for 5 min. Cells were then promptly fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed three times in PBS, rinsed in H2O, and mounted on glass slides in ProLong Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes). Confocal Microscopy—Confocal microscopy was performed on a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 system coupled with an Olympus IX70 microscope using a 60× water-immersion lens (numerical aperture 1.3). The data were processed with Laser Sharp 2000 software. Co-localization experiments with Alexa Fluor™ 594-conjugated IgG to detect the HA-tagged P2Y2 receptor and Oregon Green 488-conjugated IgG to detect the EGFR were performed at 590 nm excitation/617 nm emission and 496 nm excitation/524 nm emission wavelengths for the respective antibodies. Yellow pixels, representing co-localization of the P2Y2 receptor and EGFR, were quantified in single cells using Meta Imaging Series version 4.5 (Universal Imaging Corporation, Downingtown, PA). In brief, the images representing the P2Y2 receptor and the EGFR were normalized for their intensities before single cells were selected. The number of yellow pixels representing co-localization versus the number of pixels representing total P2Y2 receptors was recorded. The extent of co-localization was expressed as a percentage of the total P2Y2 receptors detected. Immunoprecipitation of the P2Y2Receptor—Cells expressing HA-tagged P2Y2 receptor constructs were grown to 80% confluence in 100-mm tissue culture plates and transiently transfected for 5 h with 24 μg of c-Src cDNA inserted in vector pUSEamp (Upstate Biotechnology) using LipofectAMINE 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) at a DNA:LipofectAMINE ratio of 1:5. The cells were then serum-starved for 24 h and stimulated in the presence or absence of 100 μm UTP. The cells were washed with cold PBS and incubated in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) for 10 min at 4 °C. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min, and a Lowry assay was performed on the supernatant to determine protein concentration. Then, 200 μg of the supernatant was incubated with 50 μl of anti-HA antibody conjugated to agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, resuspended in 80 μl of 2× Laemmli's sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and heated in boiling water for 5 min to solubilize and dissociate the proteins. The solubilized proteins (30 μl/lane) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting of Src on the membranes was performed by incubation overnight at 4 °C in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl) containing 5% non-fat milk and 1:1000 dilution of mouse monoclonal anti-Src antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) or rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Tyr416 Src antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). Then, the nitrocellulose membranes were washed four times in TTBS, incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBS with 1:1000 dilution of HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody, and washed three times in TTBS. Proteins were visualized on x-ray film with the Luminol reagent as described above. Role of Src Tyrosine Kinase in P2Y2Receptor Signaling—Consistent with a role for Src in signaling pathways coupled to the wild-type P2Y2 receptor expressed in human 1321N1 astrocytoma cells, the Src inhibitor PP2 decreased phosphorylation of a number of signaling molecules induced by the P2Y2 receptor agonist UTP. PP2 partially inhibited the UTP-induced activation of the MAP kinases Erk1/2 (Fig. 1A), consistent with the Src-dependence of Erk1/2 phosphorylation by many GPCRs (1Luttrell L.M.

Pyk2 was phosphorylated on Tyr881 (Fig. 1B) but not on Tyr402 (data not shown) upon UTP stimulation of 1321N1 cells expressing P2Y2 receptors, similar to Pyk2 activation mediated by the P2Y2 receptor in PC12 cells (15Soltoff S.P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2653-2660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and Tyr881-Pyk2 phosphorylation was completely inhibited by PP2 (Fig. 1B). In UTP-treated 1321N1 cells expressing P2Y2 receptors, PP2 also inhibited phosphorylation of the PDGFR-β on Tyr716 (Fig. 1C), a reported Grb2 binding site (16Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of the EGFR on Tyr992 (Fig. 1D), consistent with phosphorylation of EGFR mediated by the P2Y2 receptor in PC12 cells (2Soltoff S.P.

In Vitro Binding of Src to Peptides Matching the Consensus SH3 Binding Sites of the P2Y2Receptor—A region in the carboxyl-terminal tail of the human P2Y2 receptor (AKPPTGPSPATPARRR) contains two PXXP motifs (P, proline; X, any amino acid) that are consensus binding sequences for SH3 domains of many proteins, including Src and PI3 kinase (17Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). To determine whether the consensus SH3 binding sites in the P2Y2 receptor interact with Src, in vitro Src binding assays were performed with synthetic peptides. Results shown in Fig. 2 indicate that Src binds to a synthetic peptide (P2Y2 PXXP peptide) matching the carboxyl-terminal region of the P2Y2 receptor containing the SH3 binding sites. In contrast, a peptide (P2Y2 C-tail peptide) designed from the carboxyl-terminal region of the P2Y2 receptor that lacks the SH3 binding domains did not show appreciable Src binding. A peptide (Src binding peptide) selected from a combinatorial peptide library and known to have high binding affinity for Src (12Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar) was used as a positive control. The band below p60 Src (Fig. 2) is believed to be a degradation product of Src. Sequence and Expression of a P2Y2Receptor Lacking the PXXP Motifs—To assist in determining the function of the P2Y2 receptor PXXP motifs, a deletion mutant lacking the PXXP motifs was constructed (Fig. 3A, del). Also, a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag was incorporated at the amino terminus of the P2Y2 receptor constructs for immunological analysis (18Green S.A. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26215-26219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell surface expression of the deletion mutant was verified by using flow cytometry, which indicated that the deletion mutant was expressed at a level equivalent to the wild-type P2Y2 receptor (Fig. 3B). Association of Src with the Activated P2Y2Receptor—To further address the possibility that the PXXP motifs in the P2Y2 receptor interact with Src, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. The results showed that upon UTP stimulation, Src co-precipitated with the wild-type P2Y2 receptor but not with the deletion mutant (Fig. 4, top), suggesting that activation of the P2Y2 receptor allows Src to bind to the PXXP motifs in this receptor. Furthermore, the Src protein that co-precipitated with the wild-type P2Y2 receptor was phosphorylated at Tyr416 (Fig. 4, bottom), an autophosphorylation site that stimulates Src kinase activity (19Tang Y. Hu L.A. Miller W.E. Ringstad N. Hall R.A. Pitcher J.A. DeCamilli P. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12559-12564Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Deletion of the PXXP Motifs Does Not Affect P2Y2Receptor-mediated Calcium Mobilization or MAP Kinase Phosphorylation—The deletion mutant was used to investigate the role of the PXXP motifs on downstream signaling of the P2Y2 receptor. The results indicated that the deletion mutant mediated UTP-induced calcium mobilization (Fig. 5A), phosphorylation of the MAP kinases, Erk1/2 (Fig. 5B), and phosphorylation of the stress-activated kinases p38 and JNK1/2/3 (data not shown), similar to the wild-type receptor. Phosphorylation of Src, Pyk2, PDGFR, and EGFR Is Mediated by the PXXP Motifs of the P2Y2Receptor—In comparison to the wild-type P2Y2 receptor, Src phosphorylation induced by UTP was decreased by 85% for the deletion mutant (Fig. 6A). In addition, UTP-induced phosphorylation of Pyk2 (Fig. 6B), PDGFR (Fig. 6C), and EGFR (Fig. 6D) was decreased by ∼50% for the deletion mutant compared with the wild-type P2Y2 receptor. Co-localization of the EGFR with the Activated P2Y2Receptor—To determine whether the P2Y2 receptor associates with growth factor receptors, we used immunofluorescence to analyze the distribution of P2Y2 receptors relative to EGFRs. The results indicated that UTP caused co-localization of the wild-type P2Y2 receptor and EGFR in the plasma membrane (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, this UTP-induced co-localization was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with PP2 (Fig. 7B), suggesting a role for Src kinase in mediating co-localization of the P2Y2 receptor and EGFR. UTP did not induce co-localization of the deletion mutant with the EGFR (data not shown), further suggesting that Src bound to the PXXP motifs in the P2Y2 receptor is responsible for mediating co-localization of these receptors. SH3 binding sites (PXXP motifs) serve important functional roles in many GPCRs. For example, a recent study has shown that PXXP motifs in the third intracellular loop and the carboxyl-terminal tail of the β3 adrenergic receptor interact directly with Src and are required for Erk1/2 activation (14Cao W. Luttrell L.M. Medvedev A.V. Pierce K.L. Daniel K.W. Dixon T.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38131-38134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). PXXP motifs in the β1 adrenergic receptor interact with endophilins, SH3 domain-containing proteins, and are involved in receptor internalization and receptor coupling to G proteins (18Green S.A. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26215-26219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Tang Y. Hu L.A. Miller W.E. Ringstad N. Hall R.A. Pitcher J.A. DeCamilli P. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12559-12564Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In the dopamine D4 receptor, PXXP motifs have been implicated in the control of receptor internalization as well as coupling to adenylyl cyclase and MAP kinase (20Oldenhof J. Vickery R. Anafi M. Oak J. Ray A. Schoots O. Pawson T. von Zastrow M. Van Tol H.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15726-15736Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that the PXXP motifs in the carboxyl-terminal tail of the P2Y2 receptor interact directly with Src and are required for activation of Src, Pyk2, and growth factor receptors. Although transactivation of growth factor receptors by GPCRs has been reported to cause Src-dependent activation of Erk1/2 in some cells (5Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar, 6Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), the results of the present study show that the PXXP motifs of the P2Y2 receptor are not required for activation of Erk1/2 but are required for transactivation of growth factor receptors. One explanation for this discrepancy could be that multiple pathways couple the P2Y2 receptor to Erk1/2 activation and inhibition of one pathway (e.g. EGFR transactivation mediated by Src binding to PXXP motifs in the P2Y2 receptor) can be compensated for by an increase in Erk1/2 activity by means of another pathway. Another explanation could be that other proteins in a complex with the P2Y2 receptor via different domains than the PXXP motifs are also responsible for interacting with Src, and it is this interaction that allows Src to activate Erk1/2. In support of this hypothesis, an RGD integrin binding motif in the first extracellular loop of the P2Y2 receptor was found to be important for coupling this receptor to αvβ3/β5 integrins, as well as to Erk1/2 activation (21Erb L. Liu J. Ockerhausen J. Kong Q. Garrad R.C. Griffin K. Neal C. Krugh B. Santiago-Perez L.I. Gonzalez F.A. Gresham H.D. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because Src is also an intermediate in the αvβ3 signaling pathway (22Moro L. Dolce L. Cabodi S. Bergatto E. Erba E.B. Smeriglio M. Turco E. Retta S.F. Giuffrida M.G. Venturino M. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Conti A. Schaefer E. Beguinot L. Tacchetti C. Gaggini P. Silengo L. Tarone G. Defilippi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9405-9414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), this may explain why the Src inhibitor, PP2, inhibited P2Y2 receptor-mediated Erk1/2 activation in 1321N1 cell transfectants (Fig. 1), whereas deletion of the PXXP motifs in the P2Y2 receptor had no effect on Erk1/2 activation (Fig. 5B). The inhibitory effect of PP2 on P2Y2 receptor-mediated Erk1/2 activity in this study is consistent with effects of Src kinase inhibitors on GPCR-mediated Erk1/2 activity (23Shah B.H. Catt K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Zhong H. Minneman K.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 889-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and with inhibition of Src activity by over-expression of C-terminal Src kinase in COS-7 cells that impaired LPA receptor-mediated Erk1/2 activation (25Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19443-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Likewise, the inability of the mutant P2Y2 receptor lacking the PXXP motifs to affect Erk1/2 signaling in this study is consistent with other studies showing that expression of a dominant-negative Src mutant did not affect LPA receptor-mediated Erk1/2 activation in COS-7 cells (26Kranenburg O. Verlaan I. Hordijk P.L. Moolenaar W.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3097-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and that Erk1/2 activation was not impaired in fibroblasts from Src-/- mice in response to LPA receptor activation even though transactivation of the EGFR was inhibited (3Andreev J. Galisteo M.L. Kranenburg O. Logan S.K. Chiu E.S. Okigaki M. Cary L.A. Moolenaar W.H. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20130-20135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that not only do the mechanisms of Erk1/2 activation by GPCRs vary somewhat between different cell and receptor types but that caution should be taken when interpreting results from experiments with kinase inhibitors that may not be entirely specific and with over-expression experiments that may alter the normal composition of signaling complexes. Analysis of 160 human protein sequences listed in a Class A rhodopsin-like GPCR data base indicated that ∼30% of these receptors contain one or more PXXP motif(s) in the third intracellular loop or the carboxyl-terminal tail. It was noted that the percent distribution of PXXP motifs is fairly equal among Gαi-, Gαs-, and Gαq-coupled receptors. Because βγ-subunits of G proteins, which can interact with any α-subunit, have been shown to stimulate Src kinase activity (25Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19443-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 27Ma Y.C. Huang X.Y. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 46-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), complex formation between an SH3 domain-containing protein and certain GPCRs containing PXXP motifs may facilitate the effects of βγ-subunits on Src kinase activity. In support of this idea, our results in 1321N1 cells have shown that activation of the wild-type P2Y2 receptor, but not the P2Y2 receptor lacking the PXXP motifs, causes phosphorylation of Src at Tyr416 (Fig. 6A), an autophosphorylation site that stimulates Src kinase activity (28Sanjay A. Houghton A. Neff L. DiDomenico E. Bardelay C. Antoine E. Levy J. Gailit J. Bowtell D. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculate that recruitment of Src to the cell membrane by binding to the PXXP motifs in the P2Y2 receptor may be necessary to mediate the effects of βγ-subunits of G proteins on Src activation. Our results also indicate that activation of wild-type P2Y2 receptors, but not P2Y2 receptors lacking the PXXP motifs, causes phosphorylation of Pyk2 at Tyr881 (Fig. 6B). Several Pyk2 tyrosine residues have been reported to be either autophosphorylated (at Tyr402) or phosphorylated by Src (at Tyr580 and Tyr881) (3Andreev J. Galisteo M.L. Kranenburg O. Logan S.K.

Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). We found that the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 inhibited P2Y2 receptor-mediated phosphorylation of Pyk2 at Tyr881 (Fig. 1B), further suggesting that phosphorylation of Tyr881 requires Src kinase activity. Src-dependent phosphorylation of Pyk2 causes the formation of an SH2 binding site in Pyk2 that has been shown to enhance association of Pyk2 with several SH2 domain-containing proteins including Src (3Andreev J. Galisteo M.L. Kranenburg O. Logan S.K. Chiu E.S. Okigaki M. Cary L.A. Moolenaar W.H. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20130-20135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and the adaptor protein Grb2 (29Avraham H. Park S.Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Besides having a role in GPCR-mediated transactivation of growth factor receptors (1Luttrell L.M. Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T.

Park S.Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 30Du Q.S. Ren X.R. Xie Y. Wang Q. Mei L. Xiong W.C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2977-2987PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, P2Y2 receptor-mediated Pyk2 activation, which is dependent upon the presence of the PXXP motifs in the receptor, is postulated to have similar physiological consequences. This study shows that the agonist UTP causes the wild-type P2Y2 receptor to co-localize with the EGFR, and that this co-localization is inhibited by the Src inhibitor PP2 (Fig. 7). Our previous studies have shown that the P2Y2 receptor also co-localizes with αvβ3/β5 integrins, although this interaction was found to occur independently of agonist stimulation (21Erb L. Liu J. Ockerhausen J. Kong Q. Garrad R.C. Griffin K. Neal C. Krugh B. Santiago-Perez L.I. Gonzalez F.A. Gresham H.D. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).

Thus, we speculate that the P2Y2 receptor may be a component of a large signaling complex containing integrins and proteins associated with integrins such as Src, focal adhesion kinase, Pyk2, EGFR, PDGFR, and the actin cytoskeleton. A better understanding of the nature of these multi-protein interactions and signaling events involving P2Y2 receptors will likely identify intervention points for selectively controlling P2Y2 receptor activities that mediate the development of intimal hyperplasia in arteries (9Seye C.I.

In vitro biochemical studies showed that recombinant HDAC6, but not HDAC4, bound directly to the protein phosphatase (PP)1 catalytic subunit. No association was observed between HDAC6 and PP2A, another major protein phosphatase. PP1 binding was mapped to the second catalytic domain and adjacent C-terminal sequences in HDAC6, and treatment of cells with trichostatin A (TSA) disrupted endogenous HDAC6·PP1 complexes.

Reversible protein phosphorylation is the most prevalent protein modification regulating eukaryotic cell physiology. Identification of numerous acetyltransferases and deacetylases suggests that protein acetylation also controls many physiological events (1Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). Studies of histone acetylation and phosphorylation show that both protein modifications play key roles in chromatin remodeling and gene transcription (2Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2000; 103: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). The cellular mechanisms that coordinate the acetylation and phosphorylation of histones and other cellular proteins are still poorly understood.The precise orchestration of protein phosphorylation and acetylation is best exemplified during growth factor-stimulated phosphorylation and acetylation of histone H3 (3Cheung P.

Conversely, serine 10 phosphorylation inhibits the acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (10Edmondson D.G. Davie J.K. Zhou J. Mirnikjoo B. Tatchell K. Dent S.Y.R. J. Biol.

The changes in phosphorylation and acetylation of histone H3 create novel platforms that recruit nuclear factors and/or stabilize pre-existing nuclear complexes required for chromatin remodeling and gene expression (2Cheung P.

How cells orchestrate the ordered phosphorylation and acetylation of histone H3 or their subsequent reversal remains unknown.Formation of multiprotein complexes can coordinate the activities of various enzymes incorporated into these complexes to control cell function. For example, the assembly and disassembly of complexes containing acetyltransferases and deacetylases may coordinate these two opposing activities to control the genetic program required for cell differentiation (11Yamagoe S.

However, few mechanisms that coordinate protein acetylation with phosphorylation have been identified. Recent studies suggest that growth factors promote the association of the protein kinase Rsk-2 with CREB-binding protein, a histone acetyltransferase (15Merienne K. Pannetier S. Harel-Bellan A. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 7089-7096Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and may coordinate the phosphorylation of the nuclear factor CREB with the acetylation of histones to activate gene transcription. Recent studies also identified a CREB-associated complex that contained PP1, several other phosphatases, and the two Class I HDACs, HDAC1 and HDAC2 (16Canettieri G. Morantte I. Guzman E. Asahara H. Herzig S. Anderson S.D. Yates J.R. Montminy M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). How this complex was assembled or how it contributed to the expression of the numerous CREB-activated genes was not established. Recent studies suggest that deacetylase activity can have both positive and negative effects on cAMP activation of CREB target genes (17Fass D.M. Butler J.E.F. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4301-4309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and this may in part be mediated by the cAMP-mediated phosphorylation and acetylation of CREB (18Lu Q.

The present studies were directed at identifying cellular complexes formed by HDACs in multiple subcellular compartments and at establishing the interplay between HDACs and phosphatases that potentially regulated the covalent modification of cellular proteins. These studies established that some but not all HDACs formed complexes containing protein serine/threonine phosphatases. Further biochemical studies focused on the cytosolic complex formed by HDAC6 and PP1, both enzymes shown to regulate microtubule functions (19Matsuyama A. Shimazu T. Sumida Y. Saito A. Yoshimatsu Y.

Our studies demonstrated that HDAC6 directly bound PP1 and showed that inactivation of HDAC6 by either pharmacological inhibitors or mutagenesis disrupted the cellular HDAC6·PP1 complex. Inhibition of HDAC6 increased tubulin acetylation in cells, and acetylated tubulin was associated with the PP1 complexes. These data suggested that the HDAC6·PP1 complex controlled microtubule dynamics. We made the remarkable observation that the broad specificity deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, disrupted several HDAC·phosphatase complexes, suggesting a novel mechanism for coordinating protein phosphorylation and acetylation in mammalian cells. Because the increased histone acetylation elicited by TSA and other broad-acting deacetylase inhibitors is by itself insufficient to inhibit cell growth (21Brinkmann H. Dahler A.L. Popa C.

Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 1206-1212PubMed Google Scholar), our data suggested that the disruption of HDAC·phosphatase complexes and the ensuing changes in protein acetylation and phosphorylation may together account for the anticancer activity of these compounds.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—LipofectAMINE™ was obtained from Invitrogen; anti-FLAG® M2 affinity gel, phosphorylase kinase, trichostatin A (TSA), and dithiothreitol from Sigma; CNBr-activated Sepharose™ from Amersham Biosciences; phosphorylase b from Calzyme; microcystin-LR and calyculin A from Alexis; Ni+-NTA-agarose from Qiagen; Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells and QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene; digoxigenin labeling kit from Roche Applied Science; and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 μCi/mmol) from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. PP1 catalytic subunit was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle as described by DeGuzman and Lee (23DeGuzman A. Lee E.Y.C. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 356-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The following antibodies (at dilutions shown in brackets) were used in this study: anti-FLAG M2 (1:1000), anti-tubulin (1:1000), and anti-acetylated tubulin (1:1000) monoclonal antibodies from Sigma; anti-PP1 monoclonal antibody (1: 1000) from BD Transduction Labs; anti-HDAC6 (1:250) and sheep anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked IgG (1:3000) from Amersham Biosciences. Purified bovine heart PP2A catalytic subunit was provided by Brian Wadzinski (Vanderbilt University).Plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged human HDAC4, -5, and -6 as well as an inactive HDAC6 (H216A/H611A) were provided by S. L. Schreiber of Harvard University (24Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing WT and catalytically inactive HDAC10 were generated as previously described (25Guardiola A. Yao T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3350-3356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). HDAC6ΔRV was generated by digesting HDAC6 cDNA with EcoRV and SpeI and ligating the flanking DNA fragments. C-terminal deletions of HDAC6, specifically 1–789, 1–503, and 1–410 were generated by PCR with a C-terminal FLAG tag incorporated into the 3′ primers. The PCR fragments were inserted into the HindIII and EcoRV sites in pcDNA3. Baculovirus expression (Invitrogen) was used to express hexahistidine-tagged HDAC4 and -6. All cDNAs were verified by DNA sequencing by Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center Facility.Expression of HDACs in Cultured Cells—HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin-streptomycin-amphotericin B (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. DNA transfections were performed in 6-well plates using 6 μl of LipofectAMINE™ and 2 μg of plasmid DNA in serum-free DMEM. After 5 h, cells were transferred to fresh DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FBS.Isolation of Cellular Phosphatase Complexes—HEK293T cells grown to 80–90% confluence were treated with either 5 μm TSA, 100 nm trapoxin B (TpxB), or 100 nm calyculin A. Control cells were treated with vehicle, 0.1% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. Cells washed in phosphate-buffered saline were lysed in NETN buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotonin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). Cellular PP1 complexes were isolated by chromatography of the lysates on microcystin-LR-Sepharose (26Campos M. Fadden P. Alms G. Qian Z. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28478-28484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Bound proteins were eluted in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies.The HDAC6·PP1 complexes were also analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation. HEK293T lysates containing FLAG-HDAC proteins were incubated with 25 μl of anti-FLAG M2 beads for 2 h at 4 °C, and the beads were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, eluted with SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting.Phosphorylase Phosphatase Assays—Hexahistidine (His)-tagged HDAC proteins were purified on Ni+-NTA-agarose. Purified PP1 or PP2A (0.02 unit) was incubated with increasing concentrations of His-HDAC6 or His-HDAC4 for 15 min at 37 °C and Ni+-NTA-agarose for 30 min. Bound proteins were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant analyzed for phosphorylase phosphatase activity (27Shenolikar S. Ingebritsen T.S. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 102-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).PP1 Far-Westerns—PP1 binding to recombinant HDAC6 was analyzed by Far-Western using recombinant human PP1α conjugated to digoxigenin (28Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The bound PP1 was detected by immunoblotting with an anti-digoxigenin antibody and visualized by an alkaline phosphatase reaction (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSCellular Protein Phosphatase Complexes Containing HDACs—Earlier studies used Far-Westerns with recombinant PP1γ1 to identify two cDNAs that encoded a “histone deacetylase-like protein” (GenBank™ accession number AJ011972) from a HeLa cDNA library (29Ajuh P.M. Browne G.J. Hawkes N.A. Cohen P.T.W. Roberts S.G.E. Lamond A.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 678-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recent studies also suggested that HDAC1 (16Canettieri G. Morantte I. Guzman E. Asahara H. Herzig S. Anderson S.D. Yates J.R. Montminy M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and -2 (30Jin Q. VanEynde A. Beullens M. Roy N. Thiel G. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30677-30685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) existed in nuclear complexes that also contained PP1 and other phosphatases. How these complexes were assembled and their functional roles in cells remain unknown. To extend and validate these observations, we expressed HDAC1, -2, -3 (Class I HDACs) and HDAC4, -5, -6, and -10 (Class II HDACs) as FLAG-tagged proteins in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1A). Immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG antibody showed that all fusion proteins were effectively expressed (Fig. 1B, bottom). To isolate the cellular phosphatase complexes, cell lysates were subjected to affinity chromatography on MC (microcystin-LR)-Sepharose (26Campos M. Fadden P. Alms G. Qian Z. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28478-28484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with a pan anti-PP1 antibody established that MC-Sepharose bound equivalent amounts of this major serine/threonine phosphatase from all extracts (Fig. 1B). Immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody showed that HDAC6, HDAC1, and HDAC10 were present in the MC-bound phosphatase complexes. HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC4, and HDAC5 were either excluded from phosphatase complexes or were components of inactive phosphatase complexes that did not bind MC, which associates with the phosphatase catalytic center (31Goldberg J. Huang H.B. Kwon Y.G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar).HDAC6 Directly Binds the PP1 Catalytic Subunit—To investigate the direct association of PP1 with HDACs, we undertook Far-Westerns of purified hexahistidine-tagged HDAC6 and -4 proteins using digoxigenin-conjugated PP1α (28Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with anti-digoxigenin antibody showed PP1 bound HDAC6 (0.3–2.1 μg of total protein) in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). At similar concentrations, HDAC4 failed to bind PP1. The data suggested that PP1 displayed at least 10-fold greater preference for binding to HDAC6 over HDAC4.Fig. 2HDAC6 binds PP1 in vitro.A, Far-Westerns of purified recombinant His-HDAC6 and -4 that were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and overlaid with digoxigenin-conjugated PP1α. Molecular mass markers (kDa) are indicated. B, rabbit skeletal muscle PP1 was incubated with increasing amounts of His-HDAC6 (triangles) or His-HDAC4 (diamonds). The HDAC·PP1 complexes were sedimented using Ni-NTA agarose, and supernatants were assayed for phosphorylase phosphatase activity (see “Materials and Methods”). Bovine heart PP2A was also incubated with His-HDAC6 (circles) and supernatants assayed as described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PP1 and PP2A comprise more than 90% of serine/threonine phosphatase activity in mammalian cells and bind MC with equal affinity. To examine specificity of HDAC6 for these phosphatases, we incubated rabbit skeletal muscle PP1 and bovine heart PP2A with increasing concentrations of recombinant His-HDAC6 or -4. HDAC·phosphatase complexes were sedimented using Ni+-NTA agarose, and residual phosphatase activity was assayed using the standard substrate, phosphorylase a. Consistent with the Far-Westerns, His-HDAC6 depleted PP1 activity in a dose-dependent manner. 0.3 μg of His-HDAC6 (Fig. 2B, filled triangles) depleted more than 50% of PP1 activity. PP1 did not bind Ni+-NTA agarose in the absence of His-HDAC6 (data not shown). The specificity of the HDAC6-PP1 interaction was established by the finding that at comparable concentrations His-HDAC6 did not sediment or deplete PP2A activity (Fig. 2B, filled diamonds). Under identical assay conditions, His-HDAC4 failed to sediment both PP1 (Fig. 2B, open circles) and PP2A (data not shown). In experiments that utilized 50–100-fold higher concentrations of PP1, immunoblotting of pellets and supernatants demonstrated that the PP1 removed from solution by His-HDAC6 bound to Ni+-NTA agarose could be fully accounted for in the pellet (data not shown).Conversely, His-HDAC6 did not bind MC-Sepharose unless preincubated with PP1. Preincubation of HDAC6 with PP2A, which bound MC-Sepharose, did not recruit His-HDAC6 to the affinity matrix (data not shown). This established that HDAC6 selectively bound PP1, and an HDAC6·PP1 complex could be assembled in the absence of other proteins.PP1 Binds C-terminal Domain of HDAC6 —To define the PP1-binding domain in HDAC6, we expressed FLAG-HDAC6 proteins with serial C-terminal deletions (Fig. 3A) in HEK293T cells and examined their incorporation into endogenous PP1 complexes. Immunoblotting lysates with anti-FLAG antibody established equivalent expression of HDAC6 polypeptides (Fig. 3B). Immunoblotting with an anti-PP1 antibody showed that MC-Sepharose sedimented PP1 from all lysates (Fig. 3B). Immunoblotting MC-bound proteins with an anti-FLAG antibody established that only WT-HDAC6 (1–1215) and HDAC6 (ΔBUZ, Binder of Ubiquitin Zinc Finger) bound PP1. HDAC6 (1–781), (1–503), and (1–410) failed to bind PP1 (Fig. 3B). This suggested that the region between amino acids 781 and 931 in HDAC6 was required for PP1 binding.Fig. 3PP1 binds the C-terminal domain of HDAC6.A, schematic of FLAG-tagged HDAC6 with C-terminal deletions. The two catalytic domains (CAT1 and CAT2) and the ubiquitin-binding domain (BUZ) are shown as open boxes. B, phosphatase complexes were isolated using MC-Sepharose (MCS). The bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted (IB) with anti-FLAG (top panel) and anti-PP1 antibodies (middle panel). Immunoblotting cell lysates with anti-FLAG antibody showed equivalent expression of all HDAC6 proteins (bottom panel). Molecular mass markers (kDa) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also undertook pull-downs from untransfected HEK293T cell lysates using GST·HDAC6 (1–556), (556–832), and (832–1215) (32Hook S.S. Orian A. Cowley S.M. Eisenman R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13425-13430Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and immunoblotted the proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose with an anti-PP1 antibody. These data showed that GST·HDAC6 (832–1215) bound PP1. Weak PP1 binding was seen to GST·HDAC6 (556–832). However, the N-terminal domain GST·HDAC6 (1–556) failed to bind PP1. 2M. H. Brush and S. Hook, unpublished results. Together, the data hinted at an extended PP1-binding site located between amino acids 556 and 931. Further studies are needed to define the precise mechanism for PP1 binding to not only HDAC6 but also HDAC1 and -10, which were also incorporated into cellular PP1 complexes.Active HDAC Binds PP1—The PP1-binding domain in HDAC6 (556–931) encompassed the second HDAC catalytic domain. To examine the importance of HDAC activity in PP1 binding, we isolated endogenous HDAC6·PP1 complexes from control HEK293T cells using MC-Sepharose (Fig. 4A). Treatment of cells with the HDAC inhibitor TSA inhibited HDAC6 and increased the acetylation of tubulin, a physiological substrate of the enzyme detected by immunoblotting with an anti-acetyl-tubulin antibody (33Hubbert C. Guardiola A. Shao R. Kawaguchi Y. Ito A. Nixon A. Yoshida M. Wang X.F. Yao T.P. Nature. 2002; 417: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). While TSA treatment had no effect on the amount of PP1 bound to MC-Sepharose, no HDAC6 was detected in these complexes. Brief exposure to TSA following cell homogenization (TSA*) also disrupted the HDAC6·PP1 complex, suggesting that this event did not require the increased acetylation of cellular proteins. In contrast, TpxB, a very weak HDAC6 inhibitor (34Furumai R. Komatsu Y. Nishino N. Khochbin S. Yoshida M. Hirinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), had no effect on HDAC6 binding to endogenous PP1 or tubulin acetylation in HEK293T cells. This suggested that the HDAC inhibitors targeted HDAC6 to disrupt the cellular HDAC6·PP1 complex. Consistent with the ability of the HDAC6·PP1 complex to bind MC, the cell-permeable PP1 inhibitor calyculin A had no effect on the formation of a cellular HDAC6·PP1 complex.Fig. 4HDAC6 inhibition disrupts PP1 binding.A, HEK293T cells were treated with vehicle (control), trichostatin A (TSA; 5 μm, 1 h), trapoxin B (TpxB; 100 nm, 8 h), or calyculin A (CA; 100 nm, 30 min). TSA* indicates that TSA was added to lysates immediately prior to incubation with MC-Sepharose (MCS). PP1 complexes were affinity isolated on MCS and immunoblotted (IB) with anti-HDAC6 and anti-PP1 antibodies. Cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-HDAC6 to demonstrate equal loading. Immunoblotting with anti-acetyl-tubulin (Ac-Tub) demonstrated tubulin acetylation induced by HDAC6 inhibitors. Control pull-downs were undertaken using unconjugated Sepharose (S) beads. B, HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-WT-HDAC6 or an inactive HDAC6 (H216A/H611A) mutant. Cells were treated with TSA, TpxB, or calyculin A as described in panel A. Cell lysates and PP1 complexes isolated on MCS were immunoblotted with anti-FLAG, anti-PP1, and anti-Ac-Tub antibodies. C, FLAG-HDACs were expressed in HEK293T cells as described in Fig. 1 and phosphatase complexes isolated on MCS. Cell lysates and MCS-bound proteins were immunoblotted with anti-FLAG and anti-PP1 antibodies. D, HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing either FLAG-tagged WT-HDAC6 or FLAG-GADD34, a known PP1 regulator. MCS was used to isolate phosphatase complexes from cells treated with vehicle or TSA (as described in panels A and B). MCS-bound proteins were immunoblotted with anti-FLAG and anti-PP1 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also expressed WT and a catalytically inactive mutant of FLAG-HDAC6 (H216A/H611A) in HEK293T cells (Fig. 4B). As seen with endogenous HDAC6, FLAG-HDAC6 bound PP1 and was concentrated by MC-Sepharose. Treatment of cells with TSA or post-homogenization addition of TSA disrupted the FLAG-HDAC6·PP1 complex. In contrast, catalytically inactive FLAG-HDAC6, although expressed at similar levels, was not incorporated into cellular PP1 complexes. These data suggested that both HDAC6 and PP1 were active in the cellular HDAC6·PP1 complex. Similar results were obtained with HDAC10 (data not shown).We also examined the effect of TSA on phosphatase complexes containing FLAG-tagged HDAC1, -6, and -10 expressed in HEK293T cells (Fig. 4C). All three HDACs were expressed at near equivalent levels and incorporated into phosphatase complexes that bound MC-Sepharose. TSA treatment prevented the incorporation of all three HDACs into the MC-bound complexes. This suggested that the broad specificity HDAC inhibitor, TSA, disrupted multiple HDAC·phosphatase complexes.As an additional control we analyzed the effect of TSA on PP1 binding to GADD34, which targets PP1 to regulate protein translation (35Brush M.H. Weiser D.C. Shenolikar S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 1292-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Expression of FLAG-GADD34 followed by affinity chromatography on MC-Sepharose showed that GADD34 was incorporated into cellular PP1 complexes. TSA had no effect on the formation of a cellular PP1·GADD34 complex (Fig. 4D). Similar results were obtained with the PP1 regulator, neurabin, which targets PP1 to the actin cytoskelet"

Although the realization of short-term targets is an important first step, to be effective climate policies need to be conceived as long-term programs that will achieve a gradual transition to an essentially emission-free economy on the time scale of a century. This requires a considerably broader spectrum of policy measures than the primarily market-based instruments invoked for shorter term mitigation policies. A successful climate policy must consist of a dual approach focusing on both short-term targets and long-term goals."
https://openalex.org/W2031352187,"Kennedy's disease is a degenerative disorder of motor neurons caused by the expansion of a glutamine tract near the amino terminus of the androgen receptor (AR). Ligand binding to the receptor is associated with several post-translational modifications, but it is poorly understood whether these affect the toxicity of the mutant protein. Our studies now demonstrate that mutation of lysine residues in wild-type AR that are normally acetylated in a ligand-dependent manner mimics the effects of the expanded glutamine tract on receptor trafficking, misfolding, and aggregation.

The receptor also plays a causative role in several human diseases including Kennedy's disease, a degenerative disorder of motor neurons caused by the expansion of a glutamine tract near the amino terminus of the receptor (1Lieberman A.P. Fischbeck K.H. Muscle Nerve. 2000; 23: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Ligand-dependent translocation of the receptor to the nucleus is required both for normal AR function as a regulator of gene expression and for the neuronal pathology characteristic of Kennedy's disease (2Katsuno M.

Kennedy's disease is one of a group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by the expansion of CAG/glutamine tracts in affected genes (4Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). In all these disorders, the mutant proteins misfold and aggregate within the cytoplasm or nucleus. The presence of an expanded glutamine tract is the defining feature of these disorders and is causally related to the toxic gain-of-function conferred by the mutation. However, important differences among the polyglutamine expansion diseases exist, including the fact that distinct neuronal populations degenerate despite widespread expression of the mutant proteins. Such differences may be a consequence of altered normal function of the disease-causing protein. In Kennedy's disease, for example, the mutation causes a partial loss of AR function that may contribute to the specificity of the disease phenotype by depriving motor neurons of trophic support (5Lieberman A.P. Harmison G. Strand A.D. Olson J.M. Fischbeck K.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1967-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Recent data also indicate that sequences outside the glutamine repeat may modulate toxicity of the mutant protein and contribute to selective neuronal vulnerability. In SCA1, another polyglutamine neurodegenerative disease, a phosphorylation site near the carboxyl terminus of ataxin-1 affects aggregation and toxicity of the mutant protein (6Emamian E.S.

The identification of similar sequences that influence misfolding and toxicity of other disease-causing proteins could provide further insight into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying these diseases. Among the CAG repeat disorders, the mutant protein with one of the best understood normal functions is AR. Much progress has been made in defining ligand-dependent post-translational modifications of the receptor that are required for regulated gene expression; however, far less is known about whether these modifications impact the toxicity of the mutant protein. Ligand binding to the receptor is accompanied by alterations in the tertiary structure of the receptor and by several post-translational modifications. Among these ligand-dependent modifications is the acetylation of lysine residues 630, 632, and 633 (5Lieberman A.P. Harmison G. Strand A.D. Olson J.M. Fischbeck K.H. Hum. Mol.

This acetylation may be mediated by the transcriptional co-activators p300/CBP-associated factor and p300 and was shown previously to affect ligand-regulated activation of hormone-responsive promoters. These lysine residues that are modified by acetylation are adjacent to the bipartite nuclear localization sequence of the receptor, which is encoded by amino acids 608-625 (9Jenster G. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and are in a region shown previously to affect nuclear trafficking (10Poukka H. Karvonen U. Yoshikawa N.

We now demonstrate that these lysine residues play a critical role in the regulation of the subcellular localization and folding of the receptor. Mutation of these amino acids impairs ligand-dependent cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation and can lead to protein misfolding and aggregation similar to that which occurs in Kennedy's disease. Materials—MN-1 cells and plasmids encoding Q24 or Q112 AR were from Dr. K. Fischbeck. K630A and K632A/K633A mutants (numbering based on a Q19 AR) were described previously (8Fu M. Wang C.

Antibodies against AR (N-2O), Hsp90, and β-tubulin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Hsp40 was from Stressgen (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), and anti-Hsp70 was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). CHIP antibody, a gift from Dr. C. Patterson, was described previously (15Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Anti-polyglutamine antibody (1C2) was from Chemicon (Tamecula, CA). FITC and Texas red-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). R1881 was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Hydroxyflutamide was from Schering-Plough. Cell Transfection—HeLa cells were grown in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% charcoal and dextran-stripped fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent using 3 μl of FuGENE 6 and 1 μg of DNA. MN-1 cells stably expressing AR were isolated after co-transfection with pTracer EF/Bsd (Invitrogen) and indicated AR expression constructs. Cells were selected in medium supplemented with 7 μg/ml blasticidin. Clonal lines expressing equivalent levels of AR protein by Western blot were chosen for further analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer buffer. Protein samples were electrophoresed through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immunobilon-P membranes using a semidry transfer apparatus. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by chemiluminescence. Quantification of AR Localization and Aggregation—Following fixation and staining, cells were visualized using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 imaging system. AR localization was scored as described previously (16Galigniana M.D. Radanyi C. Renoir J.M. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14884-14889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) using the following scale: 4 = nuclear fluorescence much greater than cytoplasmic fluorescence, 3 = nuclear fluorescence greater than cytoplasmic fluorescence, 2 = nuclear fluorescence equal to cytoplasmic fluorescence, 1 = nuclear fluorescence less than cytoplasmic fluorescence, and 0 = nuclear fluorescence much less than cytoplasmic fluorescence. AR aggregation was scored by determining the percentage of transfected cells with visible protein aggregates. For each experiment and each condition, >100 transfected cells were scored in a blind manner. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells cultured on chambered slides were fixed at -20 °C with methanol and stained. Confocal images were captured using a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope and a ×63 water immersion objective. For quantification, cells were examined using a Zeiss Axiopan 2 imaging system. Electron Microscopy—Cell were fixed in suspension with 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m calcodylate buffer, pH 7.3, overnight at 4 °C, and then post-fixed in 2% osmium tetraoxide. After dehydration with ethanol and propylene oxide, cells were embedded in Epon. Thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed on a Philips 400T transmission electron microscope. Flow Cytometry—Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Cytometric analysis was performed using a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer. Data analysis was performed using Winlist for Win 32 software. The cell population was gated to exclude necrotic cells and cell debris. 20,000 events within the gated region were analyzed per sample. Specific fluorescence of GFPu-expressing cells was determined by subtracting the background fluorescence of mock-transfected cells. We first observed that point mutations in AR at lysine residues normally acetylated in a ligand-dependent manner disrupted the nuclear translocation of the receptor (Fig. 1). These initial studies utilized AR containing either 19 or 24 glutamines, both of which fall within the normal range of glutamine tract length in humans. Mutation of lysine residues 632 and 633 to alanine (K632A/K633A) shifted the distribution of the receptor toward the cytoplasm in the absence of ligand and delayed nuclear translocation of the receptor upon addition of ligand (Fig. 1A). Altered ligand-dependent translocation was observed in cells both transiently and stably expressing the mutant receptor. Clonal lines stably expressing wild-type or K632A/K633A mutant AR were established using MN-1 motor neuron-neuroblastoma hybrid cells. Treatment with ligand for 24 h revealed near complete nuclear translocation of the wild-type but not the mutant receptor (Fig. 1B). Similarly, lysine to alanine substitution of residue 630 (K630A) completely blocked ligand-dependent nuclear translocation of the receptor, even up to 24 h following the addition of ligand (Fig. 1C). Subcelluar localization of the androgen receptor was determined by indirect immunofluorescence and scored in >100 transfected cells expressing the K630A mutant following treatment with or without ligand for 24 h. This analysis revealed translocation scores of 0.63 ± 0.15 for cells treated with 10 nm R1881 and 0.54 ± 0.1 for cells treated with vehicle alone. These data indicated that lysine residues that are modified by acetylation are necessary for normal ligand-dependent nuclear translocation of AR. Decreased ligand-dependent nuclear accumulation may significantly contribute to the previously reported loss of receptor function conferred by these mutations (8Fu M. Wang C. Reutens A.T. Wang J. Angeletti R.H. Siconolfi-Baez L. Ogryzko V. Avantaggiati M.L. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20853-20860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 17Fu M. Wang C.

Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 3373-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The K632A/K633A mutant exhibited both delayed nuclear entry and ligand-dependent misfolding and aggregation (Fig. 2A). Aggregates first appeared as early as 40 min after ligand addition and formed in ∼60% of transfected cells following ligand treatment for 24 h (Fig. 2B). As in cells expressing AR with an expanded tract of 112 glutamines (Q112), aggregates of the K632A/K633A mutant formed predominantly in the cytoplasm and were not contained within membrane-bound structures such as lysosomes (Fig. 2, A and C). Ligand-dependent aggregation of the K632A/K633A mutant surprisingly produced AR misfolding similar to that caused by the presence of an expanded glutamine tract. Both the K632A/K633A mutant with 24 glutamines (Q24) and AR with an expanded tract of 112 glutamines were detected by the antibody 1C2 (Fig. 2D) that recognizes an epitope formed by misfolded proteins with long glutamine tracts. 1C2 immunoreactivity of the monomeric K632A/K633A mutant was detected on Western blot after the addition of ligand (Fig. 2D, lane 5) and correlated with the appearance of 1C2 reactive protein aggregates by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2E). No 1C2 reactivity of the K632A/K633A mutant was detected in the absence of ligand by immunofluorescence (data not shown). In contrast, the K630A mutant that failed to enter the nucleus in response to ligand did not form ligand-dependent aggregates (Fig. 1C), nor did it exhibit 1C2 immunoreactivity on Western blot (Fig. 2F). Data from cell culture and animal models of CAG repeat disorders indicate that proteins with expanded glutamine tracts co-aggregate with chaperones and inhibit proteasome function (4Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 18Orr H.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 925-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We next sought to determine whether the Q24 K632A/K633A mutant similarly co-localized with chaperones and affected proteasome function in a ligand-dependent manner. Chaperones Hsp40 and Hsp70 co-localized with aggregates formed by the mutant receptor (Fig. 3, a-f), as they do with aggregates formed by proteins with expanded glutamine tracts. The E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP (19Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and GFP targeted for degradation by the proteasome (GFPu) (20Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar) also co-localized with aggregates formed by the K632A/K633A mutant (Fig. 3, g-l). In contrast, GFPu was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm of ligand-treated cells co-transfected with wild-type Q24 AR (data not shown). Redistribution of Hsp90 to aggregates was not detected (Fig. 3, m-o). To determine whether ligand-dependent aggregation of the K632A/K633A mutant inhibited proteasome function, HeLa cells were co-transfected with GFPu plus wild-type AR, the K632A/K633A mutant, or the Q112 receptor. Following treatment with or without ligand for 24 h, mean fluorescence was determined by flow cytometry (Fig. 4A). Ligand-dependent increase in mean fluorescence, reflecting ligand-dependent inhibition of proteasome function (20Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar), was significantly greater in cells co-transfected with the K632A/K633A mutant than in cells co-transfected with the wild-type receptor. Q112 AR also significantly increased mean fluorescence in a ligand-dependent manner. In contrast, treatment with the nonsteroidal androgen antagonist hydroxyflutamide caused neither aggregation (data not shown) nor proteasome inhibition (Fig. 4B). Inhibition of proteasome function by the expanded glutamine AR may contribute to the development of ligand-dependent neurodegeneration in Kennedy's disease. Delayed nuclear entry and ligand-dependent aggregation were striking features of the K632A/K633A mutant, whereas marked inhibition of nuclear translocation characterized the K630A mutant. In both cases, these point mutations caused either partial or near complete disruption of the mechanism that normally mediates ligand-dependent nuclear translocation. This mechanism, which has been well characterized for the glucocorticoid receptor, is based upon Hsp90-mediated linking of the steroid hormone receptor to the dynein motor protein via interaction with immunophilins (21Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). A similar Hsp90-mediated mechanism regulates nuclear translocation of AR (22Georget V. Terouanne B. Nicolas J.C. Sultan C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11824-11831Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To confirm that ligand-dependent nuclear translocation of wild-type AR was Hsp90-dependent, cells at 4 °C were treated first with ligand to engage the receptor and then with the Hsp90 inhibitor radicicol. AR subcellular localization was determined following a 4-h incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 5A). Treatment with radicicol significantly inhibited ligand-dependent nuclear entry of wild-type AR, resulting in a distribution near baseline. These data indicated that translocation was an Hsp90-dependent process. We next sought to determine whether ligand-dependent aggregation of the K632A/K633A mutant was dependent upon Hsp90. Cells expressing the mutant receptor were incubated at 4 °C with ligand alone, ligand then radicicol, or ligand then radicicol plus the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. AR aggregation was assessed after a 4-h incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 5, B and C). Radicicol significantly decreased ligand-dependent misfolding and aggregation of the mutant receptor, as assessed both by direct counts of cells containing aggregates and by the appearance of 1C2 immunoreactive monomeric AR on Western blot. Although the induction of 1C2 immunoreactivity was less intense after a 4-h ligand treatment than after a 24-h treatment (compare Figs. 2D and 5C), the shorter induction period was chosen for these experiments to avoid toxicity associated with prolonged exposure to radicicol. The effect of radicicol on misfolding and aggregation was not due to enhanced AR degradation by the proteasome since a similar effect was observed in the presence of lactacystin. Taken together, these data indicated that ligand-dependent nuclear translocation of AR was dependent upon Hsp90. Mutation of lysine residues 632 and 633 partially inhibited this process and caused ligand-dependent misfolding and aggregation of the receptor that required intact Hsp90 function. Recent studies have shown that AR undergoes ligand-dependent acetylation at lysine residues present in a conserved motif adjacent to the DNA-binding domain (8Fu M. Wang C. Reutens A.T. Wang J. Angeletti R.H. Siconolfi-Baez L. Ogryzko V. Avantaggiati M.L. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20853-20860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Acetylation at these sites has been implicated to play an important role in AR activation by influencing interaction with transcriptional co-regulators (17Fu M. Wang C. Wang J. Zhang X. Sakamaki T. Yeung Y.G. Chang C. Hopp T. Fuqua S.A. Jaffray E. Hay R.T. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 3373-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Our data now demonstrate that mutation of the acetylation site also impairs ligand-dependent trafficking of the receptor from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and may promote receptor misfolding and aggregation. These studies thus identify another mechanism by which mutation of the AR acetylation site decreases receptor function as a ligand-dependent transcriptional activator. Ligand-dependent misfolding and aggregation of the K632A/K633A mutant is reminiscent of ligand-dependent aggregation of the expanded glutamine AR that causes motor neuron degeneration in Kennedy's disease. Both the K632A/K633A mutant and the Q112 receptor form ligand-dependent aggregates in cell culture that are predominantly cytoplasmic. The presence of cytoplasmic aggregates or microaggregates may contribute to the disruption of axonal transport by the expanded glutamine AR (23Szebenyi G. Morfini G.A. Babcock A. Gould M. Selkoe K.

Pozzi P. Fascio U. Vismara G. Martini L. Rizzuto R. Poletti A. FASEB. J. 2002; 16: 1418-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Both the misfolded K632A/K633A mutant and Q112 AR are recognized by the antibody 1C2, aggregate with molecular chaperones, and may inhibit proteasome function. Chaperones Hsp40 and Hsp70, the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP, and GFP targeted for degradation by the proteasome co-localize with aggregates formed by the K632A/K633A mutant, suggesting that these represent sites of protein degradation. In contrast, Hsp90 is required for ligand-dependent transport of AR but does not redistribute to the aggregates. Misfolding and aggregation of the K632A/K633A mutant are associated with diminished proteasome activity in cells co-transfected with GFPu. Although a similar approach was used previously to measure altered proteasome function in intact cells (20Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar), it is also possible that other mechanisms might contribute to the observed increased fluorescence. Decreased acetylation of histones and diminished activity of the acetyltransferase cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) occur in several models of CAG repeat disorders, including cellular and Drosophila models of Kennedy's disease (12McCampbell A. Taylor J.P. Taye A.A. Robitschek J. Li M. Walcott J. Merry D. Chai Y. Paulson H. Sobue G. Fischbeck K.H. Hum. Mol.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that decreased acetylation of the expanded glutamine AR may contribute to its propensity to form ligand-dependent protein aggregates by interfering with Hsp90-mediated cytoplasmic to nuclear transport. The inhibitory effect of radicicol on ligand-dependent misfolding and aggregation may appear surprising given the well established role of Hsp90 in promoting correct protein folding and facilitating degradation of misfolded proteins. However, Hsp90 also plays a critical role in ligand-dependent movement of the androgen receptor and other steroid hormone receptors (21Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that Hsp90-dependent movement is required for misfolding and aggregation of the K632A/K633A mutant receptor that occurs in the presence of ligand. Consistent with this interpretation is the observation that the K630A mutant does not exhibit ligand-dependent movement, nor does it show ligand-dependent misfolding and aggregation. Like misfolding and aggregation, delayed ligand-dependent nuclear entry is a feature shared by both the K632A/K633A acetylation site mutant and the expanded glutamine receptor (11Becker M. Martin E. Schneikert J. Krug H.F. Cato A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Such abnormal receptor trafficking may contribute to the partial loss of AR function that occurs in Kennedy's disease. Recent findings suggest that sequences outside the glutamine tract may influence aggregation and toxicity of other proteins with long glutamine repeats. In this context, our data complement reports demonstrating the role of Akt-mediated phosphorylation of ataxin-1 as a modifier of aggregation and toxicity (6Emamian E.S. Kaytor M.D. Duvick L.A. Zu T.

AR is subject to ligand-dependent acetylation likely mediated by the co-activators p300, p300/CBP-associated factor, or Tip60 (8Fu M. Wang C. Reutens A.T. Wang J. Angeletti R.H. Siconolfi-Baez L.

It is currently unknown in which cellular compartment AR is acetylated and whether other, predominantly cytoplasmic, acetyltransferases may also mediate this process. Disruption of ligand-dependent AR acetylation in motor neurons may contribute to the neuronal vulnerability that characterizes Kennedy's disease. None of the other proteins mutated in the polyglutamine expansion diseases are known to undergo regulated acetylation, suggesting that the influence of the acetylation site on folding and aggregation may be unique to AR. It will be interesting to define which factors mediate ligand-dependent acetylation of AR in motor neurons and to determine whether the activity of these factors is altered in Kennedy's disease.

https://openalex.org/W2030405536,"In eubacteria, the dissociation of the 70 S ribosome into the 30 S and 50 S subunits is the essential first step for the translation initiation of canonical mRNAs that possess 5′-leader sequences. However, a number of leaderless mRNAs that start with the initiation codon have been identified in some eubacteria. These have been shown to be translated efficiently in vivo. Here we investigated the process by which leaderless mRNA translation is initiated by using a highly reconstituted cell-free translation system from Escherichia coli. We found that leaderless mRNAs bind preferentially to 70 S ribosomes and that the leaderless mRNA·70 S·fMet-tRNA complex can transit from the initiation to the elongation phase even in the absence of initiation factors (IFs). Moreover, leaderless mRNA translation proceeds more efficiently if the intact 70 S ribosome is involved compared with the 30 S subunit. Furthermore, excess amounts of IF3 inhibit leaderless mRNA translation, probably because it promotes the disassembly of the 70 S ribosome into subunits. Finally, excess amounts of fMet-tRNA facilitate the IF-independent translation of leaderless mRNA. These observations strongly suggest that leaderless mRNA translation is initiated by the assembled 70 S ribosome and thereby bypasses the dissociation process.

Translation initiation plays a pivotal role in the translational control of gene expression. Although the details of the mechanism that initiates translation vary among eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and archae, the productivity of translation in general is largely dependent on the formation of the initiation complex, which involves the binding of the mRNA to the ribosome and the recognition of the initiation codon. In eubacteria, translation initiation involves three steps. First, the 70 S ribosome is induced to dissociate into the 30 S and 50 S subunits by initiation factor (IF) 1The abbreviations used are: IF, initiation factor; DHFR or dhfr, dihydrofolic acid reductase; EF, elongation factor; Eps, epsilon; fMet-tRNA, formylated methionyl-tRNAfMet; RF, release factor; SD, Shine-Dalgarno.1The abbreviations used are: IF, initiation factor; DHFR or dhfr, dihydrofolic acid reductase; EF, elongation factor; Eps, epsilon; fMet-tRNA, formylated methionyl-tRNAfMet; RF, release factor; SD, Shine-Dalgarno. 3 and IF1.

Finally, the 50 S subunit joins the 30 S initiation complex, thereby forming the 70 S initiation complex that is now set for the transition into the elongation phase (for review, see Refs. 2Gualerzi C.O.

Science. 2001; 291: 498-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar).The processes described above have been studied intensively using canonical mRNAs that bear 5′-leader sequences containing a ribosome binding site such as the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence (10Shine J. Dalgarno L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (2552) Google Scholar). However, mRNAs that lack 5′-leader sequences do occur in substantial numbers in mainly eubacteria and archae (11Janssen G.R. Baltz R.H. Hegeman G.D. Skatrud P.L. Industrial Microorganisms: Basic and Applied Molecular Genetics. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 59-67Google Scholar, 12Moll I. Grill S. Gualerzi C.O. Blasi U. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Such mRNAs, which are termed leaderless mRNAs, are translated efficiently in vivo despite of the lack of obvious ribosome binding sites (11Janssen G.R. Baltz R.H. Hegeman G.D. Skatrud P.L. Industrial Microorganisms: Basic and Applied Molecular Genetics. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 59-67Google Scholar, 13Wu C.J. Janssen G.R. Mol.

Previous studies examining the mechanism by which leaderless mRNA translation is initiated have shown that the binding of fMet-tRNA to the ribosome is a prerequisite for the binding of leaderless mRNAs to the ribosome (15Balakin A.G. Skripkin E.A. Shatsky I.N. Bogdanov A.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 16Grill S. Gualerzi C.O. Londei P. Blasi U. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4101-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that IF2 selectively stimulates the translation of leaderless mRNA both in vitro and in vivo (16Grill S. Gualerzi C.O. Londei P. Blasi U. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4101-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17Grill S. Moll I. Hasenohrl D. Gualerzi C.O. Blasi U. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas IF3 discriminates against the 5′-terminal start codon of leaderless mRNA in the formation of the 30 S initiation complex (18Moll I.

Microbiol. 1999; 31: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the IF3-dependent discrimination against the 5′-terminal start codon requires the ribosomal protein S1 (18Moll I. Resch A. Blasi U. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These studies together suggest that the formation of a 30 S initiation complex bearing leaderless mRNA may involve a 30 S subunit that lacks IF3 and/or S1. However, contradictory studies show that leaderless mRNAs prefer to bind to intact 70 S ribosomes rather than to the 30 S subunit (15Balakin A.G. Skripkin E.A. Shatsky I.N. Bogdanov A.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20O'Donnell S.M. Janssen G.R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6730-6733Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Tedin K. Resch A. Blasi U. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which suggests that the translation initiation of leaderless mRNA may actually involve an intact 70 S ribosome. This would give leaderless mRNAs a competitive advantage in vivo because the dissociation of the 70 S ribosome into the 30 S and 50 S subunits appears to be the essential step for the initiation of canonical mRNA translation. These studies indicate that the mechanism that initiates the translation of leaderless mRNA is still unclear.Recently, Shimizu et al. (22Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar) constructed a cell-free translation system that is reconstituted of purified components and is denoted the PURE system. The PURE system is composed of only those factors that are essential for the translation of natural mRNAs. This system thus allows us to adjust the concentration of each component and to pause the translation reaction at a particular step by omitting a component that is essential for that step. These advantages enable us to evaluate the involvement of a particular factor in translation more clearly than is possible with the other cell-free translation systems, such as the Escherichia coli S30 extract system. By using this PURE system, we here provide experimental evidence showing that translation of leaderless mRNA is initiated by direct binding by the mRNA to the intact 70 S ribosome and that subunit dissociation followed by mRNA association with the 30 S subunit, as is required for the translation of canonical mRNAs in eubacteria, is not involved.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of mRNAs—The mRNAs used in this study were synthesized by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase. The templates for transcription were prepared as follows. The constructs encoding dihydrofolic acid reductase (DHFR) are shown in Table I. These include dhfr-Eps, dhfr-SD, dhfr-AUG, dhfr-plus5, and dhfr-plus10. The template for dhfr-Eps (pUC-dhfr-Eps) is identical to a model template used in a previous study (22Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). The template for dhfr-SD (pUC-dhfr-SD), which contains a 5′-leader sequence that is identical to that of wild-type DHFR mRNA, was amplified from pUC-dhfr-Eps by PCR with the following primers: T7dhfr5′-SD-BamHI (5′-CGCGGATCCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAATTTTTTTTATCGGGAAATCT-3′) and dhfr3′-PstI (5′-AAAACTGCAGCTTACCGCCGCTCCAGAAT-3′). The amplification product was then cloned into pUC18. The construct for dhfr-AUG (pUC-dhfr-AUG), which has only a single nucleotide upstream of the start codon, was prepared in the same way as dhfr-SD except that the following primers were used: T7dhfr5′-AUG-BamHI (5′-CGCGGATCCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGATGATCAGTCTGATTGCGG-3′) and dhfr3′-PstI. These amplification products were also cloned into pUC18. The constructs for dhfr-plus5 and dhfr-plus10 were subsequently generated from pUC-dhfr-AUG by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the following primer pairs: for dhfr-plus5, 5′-CTATAGCTCAATGATCAGTCTGATTGCGGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGAGCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTACGGATCCC-3′ (backward); and for dhfr-plus10, 5′-GTCCCTCTCAATGATCAGTCTGATTGCGGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGAGAGGGACTATAGTGAGTCGTATTACGG-3′ (backward). The gene for the λcI repressor was amplified from λDNA by PCR with the following primers: cI5′EcoRI (5′-AATAAGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGATGAGCACAAAAAAGAAACCA-3′) and cI3′uaaSma-IPstI (5′-AATAACTGCAGCCCGGGTTAGCCAAACGTCTCTTCAG-3′). The amplification products were cloned into pUC18, resulting in pUC-cI. All constructs contained T7 promoter sequence upstream of their 5′-leader sequences. After digestion by SmaI or PstI, the linearized templates were used for in vitro transcription. The transcription products were purified by Qiagen-tip 20 (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Table INucleotide sequences around the start codon of the mRNAs used in this studymRNANucleotide sequences around the start codonaSD sequences are underlined.

Open table in a new tab Preparation of Ribosomes—Tight coupled 70 S ribosomes were purified from E. coli MRE600 cells by 6–38% sucrose density gradient centrifugation according to the method of Spedding (23Spedding G. Spedding G. Ribosome and Protein Synthesis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1990: 1-29Google Scholar). Prior to sucrose density gradient, crude ribosomes were salt-washed twice with 0.5 m NH4Cl. It was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting that the prepared 70 S ribosome was essentially free of IFs. The 30 S and 50 S subunits were subsequently prepared from the 70 S ribosome by sucrose density gradient with low magnesium concentration (1 mm) buffers. The S1-free 70 S ribosome was prepared by a poly(U)-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (24Suryanarayana T. Subramanian A.R. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2715-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Preparation of Translation Factors—His6-tagged translation factors, apart from the IFs, were purified as described previously (22Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). The genes encoding IF1, IF2, and IF3 were amplified by PCR from the genome of E. coli A19 using the following primer pairs: for IF1, 5′-GGGAATTCCATATGGCCAAAGAAGACAATATTG-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCTTAGCGACTACGGAAGACAATG-3′; for IF2, 5′-GGGAATTCCATATGACAGATGTAACGATTAAAAC-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCTTAAGCAATGGTACGTTGGATC-3′; and for IF3, 5′-GGGAATTCCATATGAAAGGCGGAAAACGAGTTC-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCTTACTGTTTCTTCTTAGGAGCG-3′. The PCR products were cloned into pET17b (Novagen), which produces recombinant factors without His6 tags. IF2 and IF3 were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified as described (25Soffientini A. Lorenzetti R. Gastaldo L. Parlett J.H. Spurio R. La Teana A. Islam K. Protein Expr. Purif. 1994; 5: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). IF1 was purified by the same procedure used for IF3 followed by gel filtration chromatography using Sephadex 75 HR10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) with HT buffer containing 50 mm HEPESKOH, pH 7.6, 200 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. The purified factors were dialyzed against HT buffer containing 30% glycerol and stored at –80 °C.In Vitro Translation (PURE System)—The system was reconstituted as published previously (22Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, in standard conditions, the system was composed of 0.5 μm 70 S ribosomes, 0.5 μm each IF1, IF2, and IF3, 2 μm EF-Tu, 1 μm EF-Ts, 0.5 μm EF-G, 0.25 μm each RF1 and RF3, 0.5 μm ribosome recycling factor, 30–300 units of each aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase, 3 μg/ml myokinase (Sigma), 1.08 μg/ml nucleoside diphosphate kinase, 30 units/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase (Sigma), 4 μg/ml creatine kinase (Roche Applied Science), 20 mm creatine phosphate, 50 μm tRNA mixture (Roche Applied Science), 0.1 mm concentration of each amino acid, and 4 MBq/ml [35S]methionine (Muromachi). The other components were the same as described previously (22Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). The reactions were initiated by adding 0.5 μm mRNA. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, 5 μl of the mixture was withdrawn and mixed with an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer. The proteins that were synthesized were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. The gels were then dried and exposed to an imaging plate followed by analysis by a BAS5000 bioimaging analyzer (Fujifilm). The assay conditions for single turnover reactions (see Figs. 3 and 4) are described in each figure legend.Fig. 4Dependence of leaderless and leadered mRNA translation on IF3.A, in vitro translation of cI (open squares) and dhfr-Eps (open circles) mRNA. The reactions were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” although the concentration of IF3 varied. Translation of cI mRNA using an S1-free 70 S ribosome is shown by the closed squares. The products were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. The protein synthesis of cI and DHFR at the IF3 concentration of 0.5 μm was set to 1. B, translation of dhfr-SD (open circles) and dhfr-AUG (open squares) mRNA. The reactions were performed as described in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Filter Binding Assay—Filter binding assays were performed according to Tedin et al. (21Tedin K. Resch A. Blasi U. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. mRNAs were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. To allow the 30 S and 50 S subunits to associate, 10 pmol of the 30 S subunit was preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min with an equal molar amount of the 50 S subunit in 50 μl of PM buffer containing 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, 95 mm KCl, 5 mm NH4Cl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm spermidine, 8 mm putrescine, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Thereafter, 1 pmol of 32P-labeled mRNA was added to the mixture, after which fMet-tRNA and the IFs were added in a 5-fold excess and at an equal molar amount relative to the ribosome amount, respectively. It was confirmed that the concentrations mentioned above did not induce higher than background levels of nonspecific binding of mRNA to the IFs. After an incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, the samples were filtered through nitrocellulose membrane and washed three times with 1.5 ml of cold PM buffer. The filters were then dried and exposed to an imaging plate. The percentages of retained mRNAs were normalized by setting the radioactivity of the total input mRNA at 100%.RESULTSTranslation of Leaderless mRNAs by the PURE System—The PURE system is suitable for the analysis of individual steps of the translation process because it is a minimal system composed of only the essential translation factors (22Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Initially, we confirmed by using the PURE system that leaderless mRNAs can be translated, as has been revealed previously by in vivo experiments (14Van Etten W.J. Janssen G.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 987-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16Grill S. Gualerzi C.O. Londei P. Blasi U. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4101-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 26Jones III, R.L. Jaskula J.C. Janssen G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4753-4760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mRNAs used in this study are described in Table I. The mRNA encoding dhfr-Eps is the model mRNA for the PURE system and was highly translated in the system by virtue of both strong SD and Eps sequences in its 5′-leader region (Fig. 1, lane 1). As shown in Fig. 1, both the naturally occurring leaderless λ phage cI mRNA (lane 6) and the unnatural leaderless dhfr-AUG mRNA (lane 3) were also translated efficiently. The translation efficiency of dhfr-AUG mRNA was about half of that of the dhfr-SD mRNA (lane 2), whose upstream sequence is identical to that of the DHFR gene in the E. coli genome. However, the addition of 5–10 bases to the 5′-end of dhfr-AUG seriously hindered the translation reaction (lanes 4 and 5). It is likely that the additional bases in dhfr-plus5 and dhfr-plus10 mRNA abrogate the correct positioning of the start codon in the P site. These results are almost equivalent to the observations made with in vivo experiments (14Van Etten W.J. Janssen G.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 987-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26Jones III, R.L. Jaskula J.C. Janssen G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4753-4760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it suggests that leaderless mRNA translation does not require factors other than those in the PURE system, at least not leaderless mRNA translation in E. coli.Fig. 1Translation of leadered and leaderless mRNAs by the PURE system. The mRNAs shown in Table I were translated by the PURE system and analyzed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lanes 1–6 indicate the translation products of the dhfr-Eps, dhfr-SD, dhfr-AUG, dhfr-plus5, dhfr-plus10, and cI mRNAs, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Leaderless and Leadered mRNA Binding to the 30 S Subunit or the 70 S Ribosome—Some natural leaderless mRNAs, such as those encoding λ phage cI, P2 phage gene V, or Tn1721 TetR, have been shown to bind preferentially to the 70 S ribosome compared with the 30 S subunit (15Balakin A.G. Skripkin E.A. Shatsky I.N. Bogdanov A.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20O'Donnell S.M. Janssen G.R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6730-6733Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Tedin K. Resch A. Blasi U. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The selective preference of leaderless mRNA for the 70 S ribosome or the 30 S subunit can be evaluated by the filter binding assay, which employs purified ribosomes from which adherent IFs have been removed (Fig. 2). The reactions all contained an excess of fMet-tRNA. The contribution IFs make to mRNA-ribosome binding was assessed by conducting the experiment in the presence or absence of IFs. As was expected, in the absence of IFs, the leaderless cI mRNA bound significantly better to the 70 S ribosome (16%) than to the 30 S subunit (3.1%). The addition of the IFs enhanced the leaderless mRNA binding to the 30 S subunit up to 12%, but even in these conditions, the cI mRNA still showed a slight preference for binding to the 70 S ribosome (19%). In the case of the unnatural leaderless mRNA dhfr-AUG, its ability to bind to the 70 S and the 30 S ribosomes was generally weaker or less stable than that of the cI mRNA. Nevertheless, it had the same binding features as cI mRNA because dhfr-AUG mRNA formed the mRNA·70 S·fMet-tRNA initiation-like complex in the presence or absence of IFs. Therefore, it is possible to say that in the presence of fMet-tRNA, leaderless mRNAs prefer to bind to the 70 S ribosome than to the 30 S subunit. However in the absence of fMet-tRNA, leaderless mRNAs were able to bind neither to 30 S nor to 70 S ribosome, probably because these cannot be tethered by ribosome in the absence of base pairing between 5′-terminal start codon and anti-codon of fMet-tRNA. It is plausible that in the presence of IFs, leadered mRNA binds to 70 S ribosome as well as to 30 S subunit because IF3 induce subunit dissociation. Unexpectedly, the leadered dhfr-Eps and dhfr-SD mRNAs bound not only the 30 S subunit, they also associated with the 70 S ribosome even in the absence of IFs (Fig. 2). However, as will be shown below, these leadered mRNA·70 S·fMet-tRNA complexes, unlike the leaderless mRNA·70 S·fMet-tRNA complexes, are not able to support translation in the absence of IFs.Fig. 2The ability of dhfr-Eps, dhfr-SD, dhfr-AUG, and cI mRNA to bind to the 30 S subunit or the 70 S ribosome. The radiolabeled mRNA levels retained with the ribosome were measured by the filter binding assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). The assay conditions used are described below each bar. The molar ratio of the ribosomes, the mRNA, the fMet-tRNA, and the IFs was 10:1:50:10 when both fMet-tRNA and IFs were included.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Translation Efficiency of Leaderless and Leadered mRNA When Associated with the 30 S Subunit or the 70 S Ribosome—We next examined whether the 70 S initiation-like complexes that are formed with the leaderless mRNA in the presence or absence of IFs are functionally active with regard to translation and whether the translation initiation of leaderless mRNA proceeds via the 30 S subunit or via the undissociated 70 S ribosome. The experimental scheme employed is depicted in Fig. 3A. The mRNA species was first preincubated with the 30 S subunit or the 70 S ribosome, together with fMet-tRNA, in the presence or absence of IFs. The resulting mixture contains the ternary complex that is composed of mRNA, ribosome, and fMet-tRNA. At the same time, the components for elongation (elongation factors, tRNAs, amino acids, [35S]methionine, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases) were incubated to generate the aminoacyl-tRNAs. The peptide elongation reaction was then initiated by adding the elongation mixtures, and the 50 S subunit when initiation mixture does not include 50 S, to the initiation mixtures. These experiments reflect single turnover reactions because release factors, methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase, and formyl donors were omitted from the system, so the ribosome would stall at the stop codon. This experimental procedure allows us to clarify whether the mRNA·70 S·fMet-tRNA complex is capable of progressing into the elongation phase and whether the 30 S or the 70 S pathway is responsible for the translation of leadered and leaderless mRNAs.As shown in Fig. 3B, in the presence of IFs, cI mRNA was translated more efficiently when it was complexed to the 70 S ribosome than when it was complexed with the 30 S subunit. This indicates that the dissociation of the 70 S ribosome into subunits hinders the translation of cI mRNA. Moreover, when IFs were absent, cI mRNA was still translated to a considerable degree when it was complexed with the 70 S ribosome, whereas cI mRNA complexed with the 30 S subunit was not translated at all. Fig. 3D indicates that the translation of dhfr-AUG mRNA was also initiated more efficiently by the 70 S ribosome than by the 30 S subunit. In contrast, in the case of dhfr-Eps and dhfr-SD mRNA, the translation efficiencies initiated by the 30 S subunit and the 70 S ribosomes were almost the same in the presence of IFs (Fig. 3, C and E). Moreover, when IFs were absent, dhfr-Eps mRNA was considerably translated when complexed to the 30 S subunit, but its translation was poor when it was complexed to the 70 S ribosome (Fig. 3C). However, dhfr-SD mRNA was barely translated when it was initiated by either the 30 S subunit or the 70 S ribosome in the absence of IFs. It may be that in the case of dhfr-SD mRNA, the weak SD sequence in its upstream region may make the mRNA-30 S-fMet-tRNA bond too unstable to support the formation of a secure 30 S ternary complex (see Table I). Thus, IFs are indispensable for stabilizing the binding of dhfr-SD mRNA to the ribosome (see Fig. 2).Together with the results obtained in Fig. 2, these observations indicate that the leaderless mRNA·70 S·fMet-tRNA initiation-like complex is capable of progressing into the elongation phase. They also strongly suggest that the translation of leaderless mRNAs preferentially proceeds by the binding of the mRNA to the intact 70 S ribosome, thereby bypassing the dissociation of the subunits. In contrast, leadered mRNAs are translated by binding to the 30 S subunit in accordance with the canonical initiation process (2Gualerzi C.O. Pon C.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5881-5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar).Effect of IF"

These data suggest that tTG protects cells against apoptosis in response to stimuli that do not result in increased transamidating activity by translocating to the nucleus, and that complexing with Rb may be an important aspect of the protective effects of tTG.

Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 439-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Transglutaminases catalyze a calcium dependent transamidation reaction that results in protein cross-linking, polyamination, or deamination (1Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Tissue TG is a multifunctional enzyme as in addition to transamidating activity it also has GTPase activity and may act as a signal transducing G protein (5Greenberg C.S. Achyuthan K.E. Borowitz M.J.

Attanavanich K. Zhang J. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11991-11994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 18Singh U.S. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15863-15871Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and associated with the plasma membrane (19Slife C.W. Dorsett M.D. Bouquett G.T. Register A. Taylor E. Conroy S. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 241: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Since intracellular localization affects protein function by determining what interactions are likely to occur, it is possible that by having access to different substrates in different intracellular pools the multiplicity of tTG effects in different cellular pathways may be due to both its localization and which enzymatic activity of tTG is favored (transamidating or GTP binding/hydrolyzing). There is significant evidence that tTG plays a regulatory role in the process of apoptosis. Several studies have reported that tTG levels and tTG transamidating activity are elevated when apoptosis is induced (12Fesus L. Thomazy V. Falus A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 20Iwaki T. Miyazono M. Hitosumatsu T. Tateishi J. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 776-781PubMed Google Scholar), and there is evidence suggesting that tTG facilitates apoptosis (21Melino G. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Piredda L. Candi E. Gentile V. Davies P.J. Piacentini M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6584-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 22Oliverio S. Amendola A. Rodolfo C. Spinedi A. Piacentini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34123-34128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However recent studies have provided evidence that tTG can also attenuate apoptosis (14Boehm J.E. Singh U. Combs C. Antonyak M.A. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20127-20130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 15Tucholski J. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 780-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Antonyak M.A. Singh U.S. Lee D.A. Boehm J.E. Combs C. Zgola M.M. Page R.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33582-33587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been recently demonstrated that tTG differentially modulates apoptosis in a stimuli-dependent manner (15Tucholski J. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 780-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This study demonstrated that when the stressor increased the transamidating activity of the enzyme, tTG was pro-apoptotic. However, tTG ameliorated apoptosis when the stressor did not result in an increase in the transamidating activity (15Tucholski J. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 780-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the effects of tTG on apoptosis are complex and likely due in part to its multifunctional character. The focus of the present study was on determining how both tTG localization and transamidating activity modulated apoptosis. To accomplish this goal, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with wild-type tTG (tTG) or tTG without transamidating activity ([C277S]tTG) that were tagged with a nuclear localization sequence (NLS), or a signal sequence that directed proteins to the plasma membrane (Myr/Pal) or with tTG or [C277S]tTG that lacked any added cellular localization sequences and therefore are predominantly cytosolic (17Lesort M. Attanavanich K. Zhang J. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11991-11994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was subsequently induced by treatment with thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the Ca2+-ATPase of endoplasmic reticulum that has been shown to induce apoptosis in different cell models (23Nath R. Raser K.J. Hajimohammadreza I. Wang K.K. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 43: 197-205PubMed Google Scholar, 24Jiang S. Chow S.C. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 25Furuya Y. Lundmo P. Short A.D. Gill D.L. Isaacs J.T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6167-6175PubMed Google Scholar). After induction of cell death differential effects of the tTG constructs on the apoptotic process were observed: (i) wild-type tTG without any added cellular localization signals facilitated apoptosis, (ii) transamidating inactive tTG localized in the nucleus (NLS-C277S) ameliorated apoptosis, and (iii) localizing tTG to the membrane had no effect on apoptosis. These findings show that the effects of tTG on the apoptotic process are dependent on the localization of the enzyme in the cell, and its multiple functions. Further, we demonstrated that tTG interacts with retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, a primarily nuclear protein that plays a key role in the regulation of apoptosis (26Herwig S. Strauss M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 581-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, after apoptosis was induced and the transamidating activity of tTG activated, the interaction between nuclear-localized wild-type tTG (NLS-tTG) and Rb was decreased, while the interaction of NLS-C277S with Rb was increased. Overall, our data demonstrate for the first time that tTG differentially modulates apoptosis in an intracellular localization and transamidating activity dependent manner. We also provide evidence that tTG binds to Rb both in the cytosol and nucleus, however induction of apoptosis impacts only nuclear tTG-Rb interactions. Given importance of Rb in the regulation of apoptosis (26Herwig S. Strauss M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 581-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), this interaction may be crucial for elucidating the mechanism by which tTG can protect cells against apoptosis. Constructs—Six different tTG constructs were used in this study. The pcDNA3.1-tTG and pcDNA3.1-C277S-tTG constructs containing cDNA for human tTG or transglutaminase inactive tTG mutant respectively have been described previously (27Tucholski J. Kuret J. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1871-1880PubMed Google Scholar). To make the NLS-tagged constructs, the cDNA for human tTG or [C277S]tTG was amplified from the pcDNA3.1 vectors by Pfu DNA polymerase-catalyzed PCR using a pair of DNA primers, the forward (5′-CCC GAC CAT GGC CGA GGA GCT GGT CTT AG-3′) containing an NcoI site and reverse (5′-CCG CTC GAG GGC GGG GCC AAT GAT GAC ATT C-3′) containing an XhoI site, digested with NcoI and XhoI and subsequently ligated into the NcoI/XhoI cloning sites of pShooter vector pCMV/myc/nuc (Invitrogen). The resulting DNA constructs, pCMV-tTG-NLS, pCMV-C277S-tTG-NLS contained cDNA for tTG or [C277S]tTG fused in-frame C-terminally with the 3× NLS from SV40 large T antigen (28Fischer-Fantuzzi L. Vesco C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5495-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To generate DNA constructs that localize tTG and [C277S]tTG to the plasma membrane a two-step procedure was used. In the first step cDNA for tTG or C277StTG was amplified by PCR using the forward primer (5′-CGC GAA TTC TGA TGG CCG AGG AGC TGG TC-3′) containing an EcoRI site and the reverse primer (5′-CCG CGG TAC CGT GGC GGG GCC AAT GAT GAC-3′) containing a KpnI site, digested with EcoRI and KpnI and subsequently ligated into the EcoRI/KpnI cloning sites of pcDNA3.1(–)/myc-His B vector (Invitrogen). The above step resulted in generation of pcDNA-tTG-myc-His and pcDNA-C277S-myc-His constructs in which cDNA for tTG or [C277S]tTG was fused in-frame with a C terminus myc epitope and polyhistidine tag. In the second step a double-strand 67-base synthetic oligonucleotide (top strand: 5′-CCC GCT AGC ATG GGC TGT GTG CAA TGT AAG GAT AAA GAA GCA ACA AAA CTG ACG GAG GGA ATT CGC C-3′) encoding the 17-amino acid N terminus of Fyn that is both myristylated and palmitoylated and thus constitutively targets the protein to the plasma membrane (29Resh M.D. Biochim Biophys Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar) and containing NheI and EcoRI restriction sites was used. It was inserted into the NheI/EcoRI cloning sites of pcDNA-tTG-myc-His and pcDNA-C277S-myc-His constructs resulting in a Myr/Pal tag at the N terminus of tTG or [C277S]tTG. All DNA constructs were verified by automated sequencing. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured in Ham’s F-12/Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Irvine Scientific) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 2 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) and 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were grown in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transient transfections were carried out using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell Treatment Paradigm—Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells (50–60% confluency) were transferred to serum-free media and 12 h later the cells were treated with 5–8 μm thapsigargin (Alexis) (due to the fact that there was lot to lot variation in the potency of the drug, slightly different concentrations had to be used in different experiments) in serum-free medium for 4 h at 37 °C. The thapsigargin was prepared in Me2SO, and the final concentration of Me2SO in the media was 0.04%. Control cells were treated with 0.04% Me2SO under the same conditions. Immunoblotting—The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, harvested in SDS buffer (2% SDS, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.25 m Tris-Cl, pH 6.8) with protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml of each of aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A) or in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA) with protease inhibitors and sonicated on ice. Lysates were clarified, and the protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce). Lysates (20 μg) were diluted with SDS stop buffer (SDS buffer with 10 mm dithiothreitol and 0.01% bromphenol blue), incubated in a boiling water bath for 5 min, electrophoresed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with one of the following antibodies: anti-tTG (TG100) (NeoMarkers), anti-histone H1 (Upstate), anti-actin (Chemicon), anti-β-tubulin (gift from Dr. L. Binder), anti-insulin receptor β (BD Biosciences), or anti-Rb (IF8) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, the immunoblots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). Caspase-3 Assay—After treatment, cells were harvested in media, rinsed once with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in lysis buffer. Caspase-3 activity was measured as described previously (15Tucholski J. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 780-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Nuclear Fractionation—Cells were washed twice, harvested in ice-cold PBS and the cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer by triturating followed by centrifugation at 380 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and used as the cytosolic fractions. The pellets were washed once in lysis buffer and twice in wash buffer (30 mm sucrose, 10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaCl) with protease inhibitors. The crude nuclei were overlaid on the top of 1 m sucrose with protease inhibitors, and spun at 1200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were collected and resuspended in buffer B (300 mm sucrose, 10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) with protease inhibitors and used as the nuclear fractions. Plasma Membrane Fractionation—Plasma membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (30Maas T. Eidenmuller J. Brandt R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15733-15740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell surfaces were labeled with sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamide) ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (Pierce), cells were then incubated with previously prepared streptavidin-coupled microspheres (Sigma) and harvested. A magnetic bead attractor was used to separate bound fractions (plasma membrane) from unbound fractions (cytosol, organelles). Plasma membranes were then separated from the microspheres using buffer with 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). Cytosolic fractions were separated from organelles by high-speed centrifugation of the unbound fractions. Plasma membrane fractions and cytosol fractions were precipitated separately using 2% sodium deoxycholate and 24% trichloroacetic acid, and pellets were resuspended in SDS buffer. In Situ Transglutaminase Activity Assay—In situ transglutaminase activity was measured as described previously (31Zhang J. Lesort M. Guttmann R.P. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2288-2295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were labeled with 2 mm 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine (BAP) (Pierce) for 2 h and then treated with thapsigargin for 4 h. Cells were collected, washed, and pelleted. Pellets were resuspended in homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), sonicated on ice, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay. The incorporation of BAP into proteins was quantified as described previously (31Zhang J. Lesort M. Guttmann R.P. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2288-2295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Luciferase Assay—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated tTG or C277S expression vector or an espy vector, E2F-pTA-Luc reporter vector (Clontech, BD Biosciences) After 24 h cells were serum-starved overnight, and subsequently treated with thapsigargin or Me2SO for 4 h. Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System Kit (Promega) and a TD-2021 luminometer (Turner Designs). For each sample, the Firefly luciferase data were normalized to the Renilla luciferase values. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were collected in medium and centrifuged at 1800 × g for 10 min. Pellets were rinsed once with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in IP extraction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 100 nm okadaic acid, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin A). Cell lysates were sonicated, precleared with protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay. Cell lysates (200 μg of protein) were then incubated with anti-Rb (IF8) (0.6 μg) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) overnight at 4 °C. Cell lysates were then incubated with protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice with IP extraction buffer, resuspended in SDS stop buffer and incubated in a boiling water bath for 10 min to extract all the immunoprecipitated proteins. After spinning, supernatants were electrophoresed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and subsequently immunoblotted with anti-TG (TG 100) (NeoMarkers), anti-Rb (IF 8) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-E2F-1 (KH 95) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 (Oncogene) or anti-histone H2B (Cell Signaling) antibodies. Statistics—All data were analyzed using analysis of variance. The values were considered significantly different when p < 0.05. Results were expressed as mean ± S.E. Expression of tTG Constructs in HEK293 cells—To determine the relative expression levels of the different tTG constructs, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with each tTG construct, collected 24 h later and immunoblotted for tTG. The results shown in Fig. 1 demonstrate that the expression levels of all the constructs were approximately equivalent. The untagged tTG and C277S migrated at ∼77 kDa, while the addition of the NLS and Myr/Pal tags resulted in a slight decrease in electrophoretic mobility of the tagged proteins (Fig. 1). Actin blots are shown as loading controls (Fig. 1). Subcellular Localization of tTG in Transfected Cells—The subcellular localization of the differentially tagged tTG constructs was verified by performing fractionation experiments of transiently transfected HEK293 cells. To determine the subcellular localization of the NLS-tagged tTG constructs (NLS-tTG, NLS-C277S), cells were separated into cytosolic and nuclear fractions. As expected, small amounts of tTG and C277S were found in the nucleus (Fig. 2A) as it has been previously reported for endogenous tTG (17Lesort M. Attanavanich K. Zhang J. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11991-11994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 18Singh U.S. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15863-15871Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), however NLS-tTG and NLS-C277S were found predominantly in the nucleus (Fig. 2A). The lighter lower band in the cytosolic fractions from the cells transfected with NLS-tTG or NLS-C277S corresponds to endogenous tTG (Fig. 2A). To confirm the purity of the cytosolic and nuclear fractions, the fractions were immunoblotted for histone, a nuclear protein or β-tubulin, a cytosolic protein. Histone was found only in the nuclear fractions, while β-tubulin was only in the cytosolic fractions (Fig. 2A). To determine the subcellular localization of the Myr/Pal-tagged tTGs (Myr/Pal-tTG, Myr/Pal-C277S), transfected cells were separated into plasma membrane and cytosolic fractions. These results demonstrate that tTG and C277S were found only in the cytosol, while Myr/Pal-tTG and Myr/Pal-C277S were found predominantly in the membrane fraction (Fig. 2B). The purity of isolated fractions was confirmed by immunoblotting for the insulin receptor β-subunit, a plasma membrane protein and β-tubulin. As expected, the insulin receptor β-subunit was present only in the membrane fractions and β-tubulin in the cytosolic fractions (Fig. 2B). In Situ Transglutaminase Activity in Transfected Cells—To determine how the transamidating activity of the different tTG constructs was affected in the thapsigargin treated cells an in situ transglutaminase assay was used (31Zhang J. Lesort M. Guttmann R.P. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2288-2295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the Ca2+-ATPase of endoplasmic reticulum, has been shown to produce an increase in intracellular calcium levels in numerous cell types (32Tong J. Du G.G. Chen S.R. MacLennan D.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 39-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Toescu E.C. Petersen O.H. Pflugers Arch. 1994; 427: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Jones K.T. Sharpe G.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Additionally, prolonged thapsigargin treatment has been shown to induce apoptotic cell death in various cell models (23Nath R. Raser K.J. Hajimohammadreza I. Wang K.K. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 43: 197-205PubMed Google Scholar, 24Jiang S. Chow S.C. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 25Furuya Y. Lundmo P. Short A.D. Gill D.L. Isaacs J.T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6167-6175PubMed Google Scholar). Our results clearly demonstrate that thapsigargin treatment significantly increased in situ transglutaminase activity in the cells transfected with tTG or Myr/Pal-tTG, but not in cells transfected with the C277S mutants when compared with cells transfected with vector only (Fig. 3A). When whole cell lysates were used in the assay, no significant increase in transglutaminase activity was observed in the NLS-tTG-transfected cells compared with vector-transfected cells after thapsigargin treatment (Fig. 3A). However, when transglutaminase activity was measured in crude nuclear fractions, a significant increase was observed in the NLS-tTG-transfected cells in response to thapsigargin treatment, with no significant increase occurring in the NLS-C277S-transfected cells (Fig. 3B). Intracellular Localization and Transamidating Activity of tTG Differentially Impacts Thapsigargin-induced Apoptosis— There is increasing evidence for the involvement of tTG in the process of apoptosis. Several studies have suggested that tTG is pro-apoptotic (21Melino G. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Piredda L. Candi E. Gentile V. Davies P.J. Piacentini M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6584-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 22Oliverio S. Amendola A. Rodolfo C. Spinedi A. Piacentini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34123-34128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) while other studies have shown that tTG attenuates apoptosis (14Boehm J.E. Singh U. Combs C. Antonyak M.A. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20127-20130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 15Tucholski J. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 780-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Antonyak M.A. Singh U.S. Lee D.A. Boehm J.E. Combs C. Zgola M.M. Page R.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33582-33587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been shown that the effects of tTG on apoptosis may depend on the type of apoptotic inducer and how the stress impacts the activity of tTG (15Tucholski J. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 780-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To investigate how the localization and activity of tTG affects apoptosis, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the different tTG constructs and subsequently treated with thapsigargin (or vehicle only) prior to measuring caspase activity as an indicator of apoptosis. Thapsigargin treatment resulted in a significant increase in caspase-3 activation in all transfected cells. However, caspase-3 activity was significantly greater in cells transfected with tTG, which is predominantly cytosolic, compared with cells transfected with vector only (Fig. 4B), while expression of NLS-tTG or Myr/Pal-tTG did not significantly affect caspase-3 activity compared with the vector (pc) control groups (Fig. 4A). Expression of C277S without any subcellular localization signal or Myr/Pal-C277S also did not have any effect on caspase-3 activation in response to thapsigargin treatment relative to the vector (pc)-transfected cells (Fig. 4B). However, thapsigargin-induced caspase-3 activation was significantly attenuated in the cells transiently expressing transamidation inactive tTG mutant, localized in the nuclear compartment (NLS-C277S) (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that tTG localized to the cytosol that is active as a transamidating enzyme is pro-apoptotic, while nuclear-localized tTG that is only active as a GTP binding protein is protective for the cell.

https://openalex.org/W2091541189,"Linear gramicidin is a membrane channel forming pentadecapeptide that is produced via the nonribosomal pathway. It consists of 15 hydrophobic amino acids with alternating l- and d-configuration forming a beta-helix-like structure. It has an N-formylated valine and a C-terminal ethanolamine. Here we report cloning and sequencing of the entire biosynthetic gene cluster as well as initial biochemical analysis of a new reductase domain. The biosynthetic gene cluster was identified on two nonoverlapping fosmids and a 13-kilobase pair (kbp) interbridge fragment covering a region of 74 kbp. Four very large open reading frames, lgrA, lgrB, lgrC, and lgrD with 6.8, 15.5, 23.3, and 15.3 kbp, were identified and shown to encode nonribosomal peptide synthetases with two, four, six, and four modules, respectively. Within the 16 modules identified, seven epimerization domains in alternating positions were detected as well as a putative formylation domain fused to the first module LgrA and a putative reductase domain attached to the C-terminal module of LgrD. Analysis of the substrate specificity by phylogenetic studies using the residues of the substrate-binding pockets of all 16 adenylation domains revealed a good agreement of the substrate amino acids predicted with the sequence of linear gramicidin. Additional biochemical analysis of the three adenylation domains of modules 1, 2, and 3 confirmed the colinearity of this nonribosomal peptide synthetase assembly line. Module 16 was predicted to activate glycine, which would then, being the C-terminal residue of the peptide chain, be reduced by the adjacent reductase domain to give ethanolamine, thereby releasing the final product N-formyl-pentadecapeptide-ethanolamine. However, initial biochemical analysis of this reductase showed only a one-step reduction yielding the corresponding aldehyde in vitro."

Carbohydrate-active enzymes display a modular structure featuring a catalytic domain and an ancillary noncatalytic module(s). The classification of the carbohydrate-active enzymes into specific families is based on amino acid sequence similarities, and currently there are more than 90 families of the catalytic modules of glycosyl hydrolases (GHs) 1The abbreviations used are: GH, glycosyl hydrolase; Araf, α-l-arabinofuranosyl residue; Araf-X2, 22-α-l-arabinofuranosyl-xylobiose; Araf-X3, 32-α-l-arabinofuranosyl-xylotriose; CBM, carbohydrate-binding module; CmXyn10B, family 10 xylanase from Cellvibrio mixtus; NCS, noncrystallographic symmetry; MeGlcUA, 4-O-methyl-α-d-glucuronosyl residue; MeGlcUA-X2, 22-4-O-methyl-α-d-glucuronosylxylobiose; MeGlcUA-X3, 33-4-O-methyl-α-d-glucuronosylxylotriose; SoCBM13, carbohydrate-binding module of family 10 xylanase from Streptomyces olivaceoviridis E-86; SoXyn10A, family 10 xylanase from Streptomyces olivaceoviridis E-86; X2, xylobiose; X3, xylotriose.

In GHs, the catalytic modules are often attached to one or more noncatalytic carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) that potentate catalysis. CBMs have been grouped into more than 30 families also based on amino acid sequence similarities (2Gilbert H.J. Bolam D.N. Szabo L. Xie H. Williamson M.P. Simpson P.J. Jamal S. Boraston A.B.

SoXyn10A consists of a family GH10 catalytic module and a family 13 CBM (referred as SoCBM13, formerly xylan-binding domain), which are joined by a Gly/Pro-rich linker region. The crystal structures of numerous family GH10 xylanases show that the catalytic module of these enzymes comprise a (β/α)8-barrel, in which the catalytic cleft is located on the surface of the C-terminal side of the central β-barrel (8Derewenda U.

CBM13 was first identified in several plant lectins such as ricin, a plant toxin that displays specificity for galactose residues. The crystal structure of this protein showed that it has an internal triple repeated sequence of about 40 residues, contains three subdomains, and has a fold consisting of six two-stranded hairpins assembled around a pseudo-3-fold axis in the manner of a β-trefoil fold (14Rutenber E.

Biol. 1992; 223: 531-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of SoXyn10A showed that removal of the CBM resulted in a 50% decrease in activity against insoluble xylan, indicating that SoCBM13 binds to the substrate and assists in catalysis (3Kuno A. Shimizu D. Kaneko S. Koyama Y. Yoshida S. Kobayashi H. Hayashi K. Taira K. Kusakabe I. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1998; 86: 434-439Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Analysis of a CBM13 from Streptomyces lividans suggests that the protein module associates with xylan by co-operative interactions through any two of its three ligand binding sites (16Boraston A.B. Tomme P. Amandoron E.A. Kilburn D.G. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 933-941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Xylooligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization (d.p.) ≥ 3, indicate that each binding site can accommodate at least three sugar moieties (17Kuno A. Kaneko S. Ohtsuki H. Ito S. Fujimoto Z. Mizuno H. Hasegawa T. Taira K. Kusakabe I. Hayashi K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Further binding studies of CBM13 show that the protein prefers highly polymeric ligands, although it displays broad specificity for several mono- and disaccharides. These biochemical studies are supported by the crystal structure of mature SoXyn10A in complex with a variety of ligands (18Fujimoto Z. Kuno A. Kaneko S. Yoshida S. Kobayashi H. Kusakabe I. Mizuno H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 19Fujimoto Z. Kuno A. Kaneko S. Kobayashi H. Kusakabe I. Mizuno H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These data show that xylobiose (X2) and xylotriose (X3) are located in the catalytic cleft. In SoCBM13 bound sugars in subdomains α and γ were identified as xylose, X2, X3, glucose, galactose, and lactose. Although SoCBM13 and ricin bind xylose polymers and lactose, respectively, at the same location, the mechanism by which xylooligosaccharides and galactose interact with these proteins is different. The O-1 and O-4 atoms of the bound xylose moiety were exposed on the surface area of the SoCBM13 so that the xylan chain could be extended from this xylose unit in both directions. In the SoXyn10A·X2 and SoXyn10A·X3 complexes, continuous electron densities were observed on both sides of the bound xylose at the O-1 and O-4 atoms, and the SoCBM13 appeared to bind to internal sites of xylan. The crystal structure and NMR spectroscopy of CBM13 from S. lividans also revealed similar structural features (20Notenboom V. Boraston A.B. Williams S.J. Kilburn D.G. Rose D.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4246-4254Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 21Scharpf M. Connelly G.P. Lee G.M. Boraston A.B. Warren R.A.J. McIntosh L.P.

In these polysaccharides, the xylan backbone is decorated through an α-1,2 linkage with glucuronic acid and 4-O-methyl-α-d-glucuronic acid (MeGlcUA), whereas α-l-arabinofuranosyl residues (Araf) are linked α-1,3 to the xylose polymer. The capacity of SoXyn10A to hydrolyze arabinoglucuronoxylan has been investigated previously (4Yoshida S. Ono T. Matsuo N. Kusakabe I. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 2068-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Kusakabe I. Ohgushi S. Yasui T. Kobayashi T. Agric. Biol.

The enzyme produced mainly four kinds of heterooligosaccharides: 22-α-l-arabinofuranosyl-xylobiose (Araf-X2), 32-α-l-arabinofuranosyl-xylotriose (Araf-X3), 33-α-d-glucuronosyl-xylotriose, and 33-4-O-methyl-α-d-glucuronosyl-xylotriose (MeGlcUA-X3); this demonstrated the position within the substrate binding cleft of the xylanase, where side chains can be accommodated. Currently there is a paucity of information on how proteins bind to decorated polysaccharides, although an understanding of these interactions is starting to emerge. Recently, the crystal structure of CBM27 from a Thermotoga maritima mannanase complexed with 53,4-α-d-galactosyl-mannopentaose has been reported, which represents the first structure of a CBM in complex with a branched plant cell wall polysaccharide (24Boraston A.B.

The crystal structure of a family 10 xylanase from Penicillium simplicissimum was solved in complex with a synthetic xylooligosaccharide that contained a 1,2-(4-deoxy-β-l-threo-hex-4-enopyranosyluronic acid) side chain (25Schmidt A. Gubiz G.M. Kratky C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2403-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this paper, we present the crystal structure of SoXyn10A in complex with the arabinoglucurono-xylooligosaccharides described above as ligands. The data demonstrate how these decorated ligands are accommodated in the binding site of SoCBM13 and, in conjunction with the accompanying paper (26Pell G. Taylor E.J. Gloster T.M. Turkenburg J.P.

Crystallization and Data Collection—Recombinant full-length enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by a modified method (3Kuno A. Shimizu D. Kaneko S. Koyama Y. Yoshida S. Kobayashi H. Hayashi K. Taira K. Kusakabe I. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1998; 86: 434-439Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Crystallization procedures were reported previously (27Fujimoto Z. Mizuno H. Kuno A. Yoshida S. Kobayashi H. Kusakabe I. J. Biochem. 1997; 121: 826-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The enzyme was crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature using a 20 mg/ml protein solution and a reservoir solution composed of 27.5% ammonium sulfate and 2% McIlvaine buffer (a mixture of 0.1 m citric acid and 0.2 m Na2HPO4, pH 5.7). After a week, rod-like crystals grew to ∼1 mm long. Sugars used in the experiments were 22-α-l-arabinofuranosyl-xylobiose (Araf-X2), 32-α-l-arabinofuranosyl-xylotriose (Araf-X3), 22-4-O-methyl-α-d-glucuronosyl-xylobiose (MeGlcUA-X2), and 33-4-O-methyl-α-d-glucuronosyl-xylotriose (MeGlcUA-X3). Glucuronoxylooligosaccharides (MeGlcUA-X2 and MeGlcUA-X3) were purchased from Megazyme under the names of aldotriouronic and aldotetraouronic acids. Arabinofuranosyl-xylooligosaccharides (Araf-X2 and Araf-X3) were prepared by the action of SoXyn10A on culms of Kumaizasa (Sasa senanensis Rehd) as reported previously (28Yoshida S. Kuno A. Saito N. Aoyama M. Kusakabe I. J. Wood Sci. 1998; 44: 457-462Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The decorated xylooligosaccharides were dissolved at a concentration of 25% in the reservoir solution and used as cryoprotectant when the protein crystals were flash-frozen under a 100 K nitrogen stream. Diffraction experiments were conducted first on an imaging-plate detector RAXIS IV2+ using Ultrax-18 CuKα x-ray generator (Rigaku). All crystals diffracted to ∼2.0 Å resolution. The collected data sets were processed and scaled using program CRYSTALCLEAR (Rigaku). All of the crystals belonged to orthorhombic space group P212121 and contained two molecules in an asymmetric unit. Further diffraction experiments were conducted at beamlines BL6A and BL6B, Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan. Diffraction data were collected using a Quantum 4 CCD x-ray detector (Area Detector Systems Corp.) at BL6A (λ = 0.978 Å) and an imaging plate detector, RAXIS IV2+ (Rigaku), at BL6B (λ = 1.0 Å), in 1.0° oscillation steps over a range of 150°. The native data sets were processed and scaled using DPS/MOSFLM (29Rossmann M.G. van Beek C.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Sugar models were added carefully into the model, and successive manual model rebuilding was conducted with the program QUANTA (Accelrys). The model was then refined by several cycles of simulated annealing using the parameters of Engh and Huber (31Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2548) Google Scholar) and gradually adding water molecules. Five percent of the observed reflections was randomly removed for purposes of cross-validation (32Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar). The stereochemistry of the models was analyzed with the programs PROCHECK (33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and WHATCHECK (34Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar) (Table I). Overall Structure—Fig. 1 shows the crystal structures of Araf and MeGlcUA-xylotriose in complex with SoXyn10A. All crystals contained two noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS)-related molecules, A and B. The root-mean-square differences between molecules A and B were less than 1.0 Å for all atom pairs. Crystal parameters and structural refinement statistics are shown in Table I. The overall structure of SoXyn10A in all complexes was almost identical to that of the uncomplexed enzyme. The root-mean-square differences between the complexed and uncomplexed structures were less than 1.0 Å. The model of SoXyn10A consisted of an N-terminal 301-residue (β/α)8-barrel motif, which comprises the catalytic domain, a 123-residue ricin-type lectin domain of SoCBM13, with an 11-residue Gly/Pro-rich linker region between the two domains. The electron density for the linker region was obscured, suggesting that this region is disordered. The electron densities corresponding to the soaked side-chain-substituted xylooligosaccharides were found in the catalytic cleft of the catalytic domain and in subdomains α and γ of the SoCBM13, as previously observed in xylooligosaccharide soaking experiments (19Fujimoto Z. Kuno A. Kaneko S. Kobayashi H. Kusakabe I. Mizuno H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (Figs. 1 and 2). The electron density for the soaked sugar was not observed in subdomain β, because this site was involved in the crystal packing interface with neighboring molecules. The results of the soaking experiments are summarized in Fig. 3.Fig. 3Binding mode of decorated xylooligosaccharides in molecule A of SoXyn10A crystals.Gray solid areas indicate the possible sugar binding sites with the subsite or subdomain defined. Decorated sugars in gray indicate that their electron density was partly observed. Arrows indicate the direction of the xylooligosaccharides from the nonreducing end to the reducing end. α and γ show the xylose binding sites of the subdomains α and γ, and αN1, αQ1, γN1, γQ1… indicate the sites adjacent to the xylose binding sites.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Side-chain-substituted Xylooligosaccharides Bound in the Catalytic Cleft—The structures of the bound sugars were almost identical between the NCS-related molecules A and B. Therefore only molecule A is analyzed in detail, as its refined B-factors are relatively low and the electron density is clearer than in molecule B. The active site is positioned at the bottom of the cleft that runs along the C-terminal side of the β-strands of the (β/α)8-barrel. Subsites at the catalytic cleft of GHs are defined as +1, +2… in the direction of the reducing end and as -1, -2… toward the nonreducing end of the oligosaccharide with the cleavage site located between -1 and +1 (35Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). In the structure of the SoXyn10A·Araf-X3 complex (Fig. 2A), three xylose units were observed at subsites -1 to -3. The substituted Araf residue was linked α-1,3 to the xylose at subsite -2, and the O-3 hydrogen-bonded to the main-chain carbonyl oxygen atom of Asp-272 and the O∈1 atom of Glu-44. In contrast, only two xylose units were observed at subsites +1 and +2. Although the density corresponding to the Araf moiety was not observed in the structure of the SoXyn10A·Araf-X2 complex, two X2 moieties were apparent in subsites -1 and -2 and at subsites +1 and +2. In both complexes there were numerous hydrogen bonds between the enzyme and the xylose moieties at subsites -1 and -2, as observed in the previous study (19Fujimoto Z. Kuno A. Kaneko S. Kobayashi H. Kusakabe I. Mizuno H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Subsites -1 and -2 were thus considered to have high affinities for xylooligosaccharides. Similar to the accompanying paper (26Pell G. Taylor E.J. Gloster T.M. Turkenburg J.P. Fontes C.M.G.A. Ferreira L.M.A. Nagy T. Clark S.J. Davies G.J. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9597-9605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), in the SoXyn10A·Araf-X3 complex, the Araf moiety was held in a rigid conformation as it was sandwiched between the xylose at subsite -3 and the protein, although in solution the α-1,3-linkage might be rather flexible. This is likely, as the Araf moiety was not observed in the SoXyn10A·Araf-X2 complex and might therefore be disordered. Only two xylose moieties, however, were observed in the (+) subsites of the cleft, and the Araf residue could not be identified because of the unclear electron density. The Araf residue should have been linked to xylose at +1 when the soaked sugar was SoXyn10A·Araf-X2 and to xylose at +2 when the soaked sugar was SoXyn10A·Araf-X3. Although O-3 of the xylose at subsite +2 was close to Arg-275, the xylose molecule at subsite +2 might contain the Araf side chain at O-3, as the substrate was slightly displaced from the +2 binding site, which may obscure the electron density. These binding modes are consistent with the observation that SoXyn10A cannot cleave substrates that require the arabinose side chain to be positioned in the -1 subsite, where the O-2 and O-3 of xylose is completely buried but is able to accommodate this side chain at the +1 and +2 subsites (4Yoshida S. Ono T. Matsuo N. Kusakabe I. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 2068-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that in the accompanying paper arabinose is observed at the -2 subsite but is not accommodated at -1, and no decoration is apparent when Araf-X3 is bound at +1 to +3, although the biochemical analysis of the family 10 xylanase from Cellvibrio mixtus (CmXyn10B) indicates that arabinose can be positioned at the +1 but not at the +2 subsite (26Pell G. Taylor E.J. Gloster T.M. Turkenburg J.P. Fontes C.M.G.A. Ferreira L.M.A. Nagy T. Clark S.J. Davies G.J. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9597-9605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus, both SoXyn10A and CmXyn10B can accommodate arabinose side chains linked to O-3 at -2, -3, and +1, but only the Streptomyces can tolerate Araf at +2. In the structure of the SoXyn10A·MeGlcUA-X3 complex, MeGlcUA-X3 was observed at subsites -1 to -3 in the active site, and only two xylose units were observed at subsites +1 and +2, similar to the SoXyn10A·Araf-X3 complex (Fig. 2B). The substituted MeGlcUA residue was linked α-1,2 to the xylose at subsite -3 and was oriented toward the solvent making no direct contact with the protein. The pyranose ring of MeGlcUA had a normal chair conformation, and 2-hydroxyl, 3-hydroxyl, 4-methoxy, and 5-carboxyl groups were all in equatorial positions. In the accompanying paper (26Pell G. Taylor E.J. Gloster T.M. Turkenburg J.P. Fontes C.M.G.A. Ferreira L.M.A. Nagy T. Clark S.J. Davies G.J. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9597-9605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), MeGlcUA was also observed at the -3 subsite of CmXyn10B. However, in contrast to SoXyn10A, the uronic acid was clearly visible at the +1 subsite of the Cellvibrio enzyme, suggesting differences in the affinity for substrate in the (+) subsite region of the active site of the two xylanases. The structure of the SoXyn10A·MeGlcUA-X2 complex was different between the NCS molecules A and B. In molecule A, no sugars were identified in the catalytic cleft; but in molecule B, two xylose units were observed at subsites -2 and -3, and it is assumed that the MeGlcUA residue is linked to the pyranose sugar located at subsite -3. As seen in Fig. 2B, the O-2 of xylose at subsite -2 makes a hydrogen bond with the N∈ atom of Trp-266, and thus the aromatic residue would prevent occupancy of a xylose decorated at the O-2 position. Fig. 4 shows a surface potential model of the catalytic cleft of SoXyn10A with a model of Araf-MeGlcUA-X3. Trp-274 and Gln-88 form a gate to the (-) subsite of the cleft, and the O-2 and O-3 atoms of xylose at subsite -1 and the O-2 atom of xylose at subsite -2 are pointing into the cleft, whereas the O-3 atom of xylose at subsite -2 and the O-2 and O-3 atoms of xylose at subsite -3 are pointing into solvent. Open space is seen to spread from the gate, and the Araf residue linked to xylose at subsite -2 is accommodated in the space between Trp-274 and xylose at subsite -3. In the (+) subsite, possibly because of weak affinities, the substituted sugar residues appear disordered and could not be observed. It appears that most of the substituted xylooligosaccharides, however, could be accommodated in the (+) subsite of the cleft, because the O-2 and O-3 atoms of xylose at subsite +1 point into solvent, whereas the xylose at subsite +2 is positioned almost outside of the cleft. Side-chain-substituted Xylooligosaccharides Bound in the SoCBM13—Although bound ligands were observed in subdomains α and γ in both the SoXyn10A·Araf-X2 and SoXyn10A·Araf-X3 complexes, the Araf side chain was evident only in subdomain γ (Fig. 3). The binding mode of linear (19Fujimoto Z. Kuno A. Kaneko S. Kobayashi H. Kusakabe I. Mizuno H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and decorated xylooligosaccharides (this study) were very similar. Each binding site in SoCBM13 interacted mainly with a single xylose moiety of the xylooligosaccharides (Fig. 5). The O-2 and O-3 atoms of the xylose at the binding site were positioned in the inner part of the site, forming hydrogen bonds with the side chains of the conserved Asp and Asn residues. The O-1 or O-4 atoms made hydrogen bonds with Gln-338 in subdomain α or Glu-421 in subdomain γ and were located at the SoCBM13 surface. The O-2 or O-3 atom of the bound xylose had other hydrogen bonding interactions with main-chain carbonyl of Pro-327 in subdomain α or the carbonyl of Val-410 in subdomain γ, and the side chain of His-343 in subdomain α. The aromatic rings of Tyr-340 in subdomain α and Tyr-423 in subdomain γ stacked against the pyranose rings of the xylose sugars of the xylose sugars. The adjacent xylose units were linked via β-1,4-glycosyl linkages in either direction. In the subdomain γ of the SoXyn10A·Araf-X2 complex, the xylose at the reducing end was located in the binding site, and thus the xylose containing the Araf residue made weak interactions with SoCBM13 (Fig. 5A). To discuss the mechanism of ligand binding in SoCBM13, the sugar residues in the oligosaccharides need to be defined. The xylose residues adjacent to the sugar located at the γ and binding sites were defined by conserved amino acids on either side of the bound pentaose. One site was designated as γQ1 (αQ1), because it is close to the conserved residue Gln-421 in subdomain γ (Gln-338 in subdomain α), whereas the opposite site was designated as γN1 (αN1), because the conserved residue Asn-430 in subdomain γ (Asn-347 in subdomain α) is located on this side. The continuous sugar residues were designated as γN1, γN2, etc. In the SoXyn10A·Araf-X2 complex, the Araf-substituted xylose was bound in the γQ1 site in subdomain γ. In contrast, in the SoXyn10A·Araf-X3 complex, the xylose bound in the γ binding site was at the nonreducing end of the oligosaccharide, and the Araf residue was linked α-1,3 to the adjacent middle xylose at the γN1 site (Fig. 5B). Thus, in the SoXyn10A·Araf-X2 and SoXyn10A·Araf-X3 complexes, the Araf residue is positioned at the opposite side of the γ binding site (Fig. 3), and SoCBM13 seems to be able to accommodate Araf in arabinoxylan at either γN1 or γQ1. Fig. 6 shows the Fobs - Fcalc electron density maps around the bound Araf in the catalytic cleft and in subdomain γ of SoCBM13. The only difference was in the puckering of the furanose ring, which had a considerable influence on the direction of the hydroxyl and hydroxymethylene groups of the sugar. Thus, the conformation of the furanose ring of the Araf residue is influenced by the network of hydrogen bonds. In the catalytic domain, the O-2 of the Araf residue hydrogen bonds to the main-chain carbonyl oxygen atom of Asp-272 and the O∈1 of Glu-44, as shown in Fig. 2A. In the subdomain γ of SoCBM13, the Araf residue points into solvent and makes no direct contact with the protein. However, the O-3 atom of the Araf residue makes an intramolecular hydrogen bond to the endocyclic oxygen of the xylose at the γ binding site.Fig. 5Stereo views of decorated xylooligosaccharides in complex with SoCBM13.A, subdomain γ in the Araf-X2 complex; B, subdomain γ in the Araf-X3 complex; C, subdomain γ in the SoXyn10A·MeGlcUA-X2 complex; D, subdomain α in the SoXyn10A·MeGlcUA-X3 complex.

In the SoXyn10A·MeGlcUA-X2 complex, the MeGlcUA-X2 displayed the same binding mode in subdomains α and γ. The reducing end xylose was bound in the α and γ binding sites, respectively, and the MeGlcUA residue was bound in either the αN1 or γN1 site through an α-1,2 linkage (Fig. 5C). The MeGlcUA residue pointed into solvent and did not interact with the protein, similar to Araf. In the SoXyn10A·MeGlcUA-X3 complex, the middle xylose was bound in the α binding site, and xylose linked to the MeGlcUA residue was located at the αN1 site, similar to the SoXyn10A·MeGlcUA-X2 complex (Fig. 5D), whereas in subdomain γ, the reducing end xylose was bound in the γ binding site. The distal xylose in the αN2 site and the MeGlcUA residue were not clearly visible. In both the SoXyn10A·Araf-X2 and the SoXyn10A·MeGlcUA-X2 complexes (Figs. 3 and 5, A and C), subdomain γ recognized the reducing end xylose, with the adjacent substituted xylose positioned on the opposite side of the binding site at γQ1 and γN1, respectively. In previous studies, the O-1—O-4 direction of the xylose unit could not be determined by analyzing 2-Å resolution electron density maps because of the highly symmetrical structure of the xylose moieties in xylooligosaccharides (19Fujimoto Z. Kuno A. Kaneko S. Kobayashi H. Kusakabe I. Mizuno H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The determination of the probable direction of the bound xylose was therefore guided by the orientation of the glucose moiety in the SoXyn10A·glucose complex, as the hexose sugar has a nonsymmetrical structure; it contains an extra hydroxymethylene group at C-5 (compared with xylose), which provided clear electron densities enabling the orientation of the sugar to be determined. In decorated xylooligosaccharides, the presence of the side chains makes these ligands nonsymmetrical, enabling the orientation of the xylose polymer to be determined. Even though the electron densities were not clear for some sugar side chains, the continuous density from the hydroxyl group of a xylose molecule sometimes allowed identification of the sugar decoration. The confirmed directions from the nonreducing end to the reducing end of the bound xylooligosaccharides are indicated in Fig. 3 by arrows. In the MeGlcUA·xylooligosaccharide complexes, MeGlcUA residues were placed on the same side of the SoCBM13 binding site, and the orientation of the bound xylooligosaccharides was reversed. Because the O-2 of the adjacent nonreducing end xylose at the γQ1 site points at the protein (Fig. 5A), the MeGlcUA residue linked α-1,2 could not be accommodated at this site. In subdomain α of the SoXyn10A·Araf-X2 complex, the xylooligosaccharide bound in both directions. These results demonstrate that SoCBM13 can bind the xylan backbone in either direction. The results also show that SoCBM13 can accommodate the side chains in various ways, interacting with both the adjacent and decorated xylose and the attached Araf and MeGlcUA xylans in the reverse direction. Because the role of SoCBM13 is considered only to bind xylan and not to direct the substrate into the active site of the enzyme, the capacity of the protein module to display multiple binding modes for its polymeric ligands may increase the probability of the catalytic domain hydrolyzing decorated xylans. In conclusion, a crystallographic study of Araf- and MeGlcUA-decorated xylooligosaccharides in complex with the family GH10 xylanase SoXyn10A has revealed details of the mechanism by which these side chains are accommodated in both the active site and in CBM13 and how these complex carbohydrates are hydrolyzed by the catalytic domain. The sugar-binding modes in the catalytic cleft were consistent with the previously reported substrate specificity of SoXyn10A toward arabinoglucuronoxylan and, in conjunction with the accompanying paper (26Pell G. Taylor E.J. Gloster T.M. Turkenburg J.P. Fontes C.M.G.A. Ferreira L.M.A. Nagy T. Clark S.J. Davies G.J. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9597-9605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), demonstrate that the mechanism by which sugar side chains are accommodated in family 10 xylanases is highly conserved. Using nonsymmetric sugars as ligands, CBM13 was shown to bind xylose and xylooligosaccharides reversibly. This flexible binding mode displayed by SoCBM13 increases the probability of the enzyme interacting with its substrate and thus catalyzing glycosidic bond cleavage. We thank Professors N.

An important mechanism for controlling enzyme activity might involve hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a potent oxidant produced by the myeloperoxidase system of phagocytes. We have shown that inactivation of MMP-7 (matrilysin) by HOCl coincides with the formation of a novel oxidation product, WG-4, through modification of adjacent tryptophan and glycine residues and loss of 4 atomic mass units. Here, we use mass spectrometry, UV/visible spectroscopy, hydrogen-deuterium exchange, and NMR spectroscopy to investigate the formation and structure of WG-4. For the initial step, HOCl chlorinates the indole ring of tryptophan. The resulting 3-chloroindolenine generates a previously unknown cyclic indole-amide species, in which tryptophan cross-links to the main chain nitrogen of the adjacent glycine residue to form an aromatic six-membered ring. WG-4 kinks and stiffens the peptide backbone, which may hinder the interaction of substrate with the catalytic pocket of MMP-7. Our observations indicate that specific structural motifs are important for controlling protein modification by oxidants and suggest that pericellular oxidant production by phagocytes might limit MMP activity during inflammation.

Nagase H. Matrix metalloproteinases and TIMPs. Oxford University Press, New York2000Google Scholar). Dysregulation of MMPs is implicated in the pathogenesis of destructive diseases, such as aneurysms, emphysema, and arthritis, as well as tumor growth and metastasis (2Chang C. Werb Z. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: S37-S43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 3Libby P. Circulation. 2001; 104: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar, 4Shapiro S.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 98-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MMPs are synthesized as zymogens (1Woessner J.F. Nagase H. Matrix metalloproteinases and TIMPs. Oxford University Press, New York2000Google Scholar). The prodomain of latent MMPs interacts with the zinc ion in the catalytic domain. This interaction is critical to maintaining the enzyme in an inactive state. The mechanisms that control the activation and subsequent inactivation of MMPs have generally been attributed to other proteinases and protein inhibitors, respectively (1Woessner J.F. Nagase H. Matrix metalloproteinases and TIMPs. Oxford University Press, New York2000Google Scholar). However, the physiological mechanisms regulating MMP proteolysis remain largely unknown. Indeed, reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates regulate MMP activity in vitro (5Weiss S.J. Peppin G. Ortiz X. Ragsdale C. Test S.T.

We previously demonstrated that hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a potent oxidant generated by neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages (10Harrison J.E. Schultz J. J. Biol.

Recent studies suggest that oxygenation of pro-MMPs may be physiologically relevant (13Gu Z. Kaul M. Yan B. Kridel S.J. Cui J. Strongin A. Smith J.W. Liddington R.C. Lipton S.A. Science. 2002; 297: 1186-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). The modification of MMPs provides a relevant paradigm illustrating how HOCl can regulate protein function by targeting specific amino acids within critical domains. Although HOCl can initially activate pro-MMPs, subsequent inhibition of enzyme activity is the predominant effect at physiologic concentrations of the oxidant (6Peppin G.J. Weiss S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4322-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 7Fu X. Kassim S.Y. Parks W.C. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol.

We recently reported that loss of MMP-7 activity occurred in concert with the formation of WG-4, an unusual oxidation product of tryptophan and glycine residues (WG) that has lost 4 atomic mass units (14Fu X. Kassim S.Y. Parks W.C. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 20: 28403-28409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In the current studies, we demonstrate that WG-4 forms an aromatic six-membered ring which kinks the peptide backbone. Our observations suggest that sequential oxidative modifications of specific structural motifs provide a single mechanism for controlling proteolysis by phagocytes. HPLC Analysis and Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MS)—Peptides were separated on a reverse-phase column (Ultrasphere, C18; Beckman, Fullerton, CA) (7Fu X. Kassim S.Y. Parks W.C. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41279-41287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). MS analyses were performed in the positive ion mode with a Finnigan Mat LCQ ion trap instrument (San Jose, CA) (7Fu X. Kassim S.Y. Parks W.C. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41279-41287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange—Peptides or HPLC-purified products were dried under vacuum, resuspended in D2O, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then 1:1 diluted with 0.5% HCOOH in 50% D2O, 50% CH3CN and subjected to MS analysis. NMR Spectrometry—NMR spectra were recorded with a Varian Unity Inova-600 spectrometer (Varian Assoc., Palo Alto, CA) (15Razmiafshari M. Kao J. d'Avignon A. Zawia N.H. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2001; 172: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional total correlated spectroscopy (TOCSY) spectra were recorded using a MELV-17 mixing sequence. Phase-sensitive two-dimensional spectra were obtained by employing the hypercomplex method. Peptide Library—Combinatorial libraries were prepared by combining all 20 N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl amino acids at an equal molar ratio in a single cartridge, coupled using the standard single couple protocol, and purified on a C18 reverse-phase HPLC column. Oxidation of VVWGTA (M) with HOCl Produces M-2, M+32, and M-4 —To investigate the reaction pathway that produces WG-4, we exposed the peptide VVWGTA to HOCl. This peptide duplicates the region in the catalytic domain of MMP-7 that is oxidatively modified in concert with enzyme inactivation (14Fu X. Kassim S.Y. Parks W.C. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 20: 28403-28409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Analysis of the reaction mixture by reverse-phase HPLC revealed the unmodified peptide (M) and five major oxidized peptides (Fig. 1A, peaks 1–5). MS analysis of the material in peak 5 demonstrated a major ion of mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 628.2 (M-4), the predicted mass of singly charged peptide minus 4 atomic mass units (Fig. 1B, [M - 4 + H]+). MS/MS analysis of peak 5 revealed a series of ions consistent with 4 atomic mass unit losses from WG (Fig. 1B). Importantly, we observed a major ion of m/z 240.1, the predicted mass of adjacent tryptophan and glycine residues that had lost 4 atomic mass units, indicating that WG-4 is produced when HOCl oxidizes VVWGTA. The presence of multiple HPLC peaks of material in VVWGTA exposed to HOCl suggested that multiple intermediates participated in the reaction pathway. To explore this possibility, we subjected peaks 1–4 to MS and MS/MS analysis. The major product in the reaction mixture, peak 4 (M+32), exhibited a major ion of m/z 664.2 (Fig. 1B, [M + 32 + H]+), suggesting that VVWGTA had gained two oxygen atoms. However, the molecular ion exhibited the characteristic isotopic pattern of a chlorinated compound (Fig. 1B, inset; note the peaks derived from 35Cl and 37Cl). Consistent with this interpretation, MS/MS analysis demonstrated a series of ions consistent with loss of HCl from peak 4. Peak 2 also contained one chlorine atom and had the same m/z as peak 4, indicating that peaks 4 and 2 were isomers. MS/MS analysis of peak 4 revealed an ion of m/z 240.1, the m/z of WG-4. These observations indicate that peak 2 and peak 4 are chlorinated isomers, and they suggest that M+32 can convert to WG-4 in the gas phase and therefore might be an intermediate in the reaction pathway in aqueous solution. MS analysis of peak 3 (M-2) revealed a major ion of m/z 630.2, the predicted mass of VVWGTA without 2 hydrogen atoms (Fig. 1B, [M - 2H + H]+). MS/MS analysis revealed a series of ions consistent with loss of 2 atomic mass units from WG. MS analysis of peak 1 (M+16) demonstrated a major ion of m/z 648.2 (data not shown), the predicted mass of the peptide plus 1 oxygen ([M + 16 + H]+). MS/MS analysis indicated that the tryptophan residue in VVWGTA had been oxygenated, likely to oxindolylalanine. Collectively, these observations indicate that HOCl produces WG-4, WG-2, and W+16 in VVWGTA and chlorinates the peptide. The generation of WG-4 from the chlorinated peptide (M+32) during MS/MS analysis suggests that tryptophan is targeted for chlorination. Formation of WG-4 Involves an Initial Loss of Two Hydrogens followed by Chlorination and Finally Loss of HCl—To explore the reaction pathway, we used reverse-phase HPLC to quantify the influence of time and HOCl concentration on the yields of M-2, M+32, and M-4. M-2 was the major product early in the incubation, suggesting that it was the first stable product when HOCl oxidized VVWGTA. To verify this observation, we isolated peak 2, concentrated the sample, and exposed the compound to HOCl. HPLC analysis demonstrated that M-2 reacted further to generate both isomeric chlorinated peptides (M+32) as well as WG-4 (Fig. 1C). The kinetics of VVWGTA oxidation by HOCl demonstrated that the initial rapid increase in M-2 concentration was followed by a gradual decline. In contrast, M-4 concentration increased with time, suggesting that M-4 was the final stable product. Consistent with this idea, M+32 was almost quantitatively converted to M-4 after 1 h of incubation in alkaline buffer (Fig. 1C). These observations suggest the following reaction pathway: VVWGTA (M) initially reacts with HOCl to generate M-2, which is then chlorinated by HOCl to form M+32. This intermediate subsequently loses HCl (36 atomic mass units) to yield a stable product, M-4. Reaction Pathway for the Formation of WG-4 —Based on our observations and the known reactivity of HOCl (16Fu X. Mueller D.M. Heinecke J.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1293-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 17Winterbourn C.C. Vissers M.C. Kettle A.J. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2000; 7: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 18Katritzky A.R. Rees C.W.

Org. Chem. 1978; 43: 2639-2643Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we propose the following reaction pathway for the generation of WG-4 (Fig. 1D). Initially, HOCl reacts with the double bond in the five-member ring of tryptophan to yield a 3-chloroindolenine (18Katritzky A.R. Rees C.W. Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry: The Structure, Reactions, Synthesis, and Uses of Heterocyclic Compounds. 4. Oxford University Press, New York1984: 214Google Scholar, 19De Rosa M. Alonso T. J. Org. Chem. 1978; 43: 2639-2643Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The unstable intermediate is converted to M-2, a cyclic intermediate. In this reaction, the lone pair electrons of the adjacent amide bond attack C-2 of the indolenine. A glycine adjacent to the chlorinated tryptophan intermediate favors this reaction by providing an unhindered local environment for nucleophilic attack by the amide. M-2 then reacts with a second molecule of HOCl to yield two chlorinated isomers, M+32, which subsequently lose HCl to form WG-4. MS Analysis of Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange of Oxidized Peptides—To study further the proposed mechanism for oxidation of WG by HOCl, we used hydrogen-deuterium exchange and MS analysis to determine the number of exchangeable hydrogens on each intermediate in the reaction pathway. VVWGTA incorporated 11 deuterium atoms (5 amide bond hydrogens, 3 N-terminal amino hydrogens, the hydrogen on the nitrogen of the indole ring, the hydrogen on the alcohol of threonine, and the hydrogen on the COOH group of the C terminus). In contrast, M-2, M+32, and M-4 incorporated 10, 9, and 10 deuterium atoms, respectively, which suggests that exchangeable hydrogens in WG are involved in the reaction pathway. The proposed mechanism for converting WG to WG-4 (Fig. 1D) is consistent with these observations. WG-4 Is an Unusual Aromatic Compound—To determine whether WG is oxidized to a more aromatic compound, we isolated M-4 by reverse-phase HPLC and measured its absorption spectrum. The absorption maximum of VVWGTA was 280 nm (ϵ = 5.4 × 103), whereas that of M-4 was 363 nm, and the intensity was greater (ϵ = 1.8 × 104) (Fig. 2A). The oxidized peptide also exhibited a marked increase in fluorescence emission intensity accompanied by a shift in the excitation and emission maxima to longer wavelengths (Fig. 2B; VV(WG-4)TA, λex = 363 nm, λem = 412 nm). The loss of 4 atomic mass units and spectral alterations suggest that WG-4 might be an unusual aromatic compound. WG-4 Is Produced by Cross-linking the Indole Ring of Tryptophan to the Amide Nitrogen of Glycine—Proton chemical shifts of VVWGTA were assigned by TOCSY and nuclear Overhauser spectroscopy (NOESY) (20Sanders J.K.M. Hunter B.K. Modern NMR Spectroscopy: A Guide for Chemists, 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1993Google Scholar). High resolution 1H NMR spectra of HPLC-purified M+32, when compared with those of VVWGTA, showed loss of the tryptophan ring NH resonance. TOCSY spectra indicated the presence of the tryptophan α and β protons. These observations suggest that N-chloroindole and 3-chloroindolenine (Fig. 1D, M+32) account for the isomers in peaks 2 and 4 (19De Rosa M. Alonso T. J. Org. Chem. 1978; 43: 2639-2643Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). High resolution 1H NMR spectra of HPLC-purified WG-4 (M-4) showed a marked downfield shift of the tryptophan ring NH resonance, from 10.9 to 11.95 ppm. TOCSY spectra confirmed the absence of the glycine amide proton and indicated loss of the tryptophan α proton (Fig. 2, C and D). For WG-4, heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence also revealed loss of the tryptophan C-2 proton and confirmed the αβ double bond. NOESY for WG-4 demonstrated a short range interaction between the aromatic tryptophan NH proton and the glycine α proton. Modeling confirmed that WG-4 formed a kink in the backbone of the host peptide (Fig. 2, E and F) and that the oxidized peptide was rigid and markedly constrained in its range of conformations. These observations can be explained by invoking a pathway in which HOCl oxidizes adjacent tryptophan and glycine residues into an unusual cross-linked, aromatic compound (Fig. 1D) that induces a kink in the peptide backbone and restricts local conformational space. HOCl Targets the Sequence Motif WG for Cross-linking—To determine whether tryptophan-glycine represents a specific motif for oxidative modification of proteins, we used a combinatorial approach to search for tryptophan residues that cross-link to other residues during oxidation. We used a peptide library based on the motif present in the peptide of MMP-7 associated with oxidative inactivation of the enzyme, VVWXTA, where X represents all 20 common amino acids. After the library was exposed to HOCl and separated by HPLC with monitoring of absorbance at 363 nm, we detected a single major peak of new material. The absorbance and fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of this material were similar to those of WG-4. MS and MS/MS analysis confirmed that the product was VV(WG-4)TA. Similar reactions involving tryptophan residues may account for the cross-linking of superoxide dismutase by carbonate radical anion (21Zhang H. Andrekopoulos C. Joseph J. Chandran K. Karoui H. Crow J.P. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24078-24089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Chlorinated amino acids and nucleobases identical to those formed by myeloperoxidase or HOCl in vitro have been detected in inflamed human tissue (22Hazen S.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2075-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 23Henderson J.P. Byun J. Takeshita J. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23522-23528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), but remarkably little is known about the reaction of HOCl with tryptophan residues in proteins (24Vissers M.C. Winterbourn C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 285: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 25Carr A.C. Tijerina T. Frei B. Biochem.

Our studies demonstrate that HOCl targets tryptophan residues adjacent to glycine residues in the primary sequence. The end product, WG-4, is an intensely fluorescent aromatic compound with a cross-link between the indole ring and the adjacent amide bond of glycine. NMR studies demonstrated that WG-4 introduces marked conformational restraints and a kinked backbone into its host peptide. Thus, WG-4 may exert long range effects on protein function by altering local peptide structure. Most studies have focused on the reactivity of protein amino acid side chains while ignoring the potential importance of adjacent sequences. Our results indicate that specific structural motifs are important for controlling protein oxidation. It is noteworthy that similar observations have recently been reported for iron regulatory protein 2, which coordinates cellular regulation of iron metabolism by binding to iron responsive elements in mRNA (27Kang D.K. Jeong J. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Rouault T.A. Levine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14857-14864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Oxidative modifications of proteins may thus be site-specific and require a specific juxtaposition of reactive moieties rather than being driven simply by the chemical reactivity of amino acid side chains. H2O2 has been proposed to act as a second messenger by transiently inhibiting protein tyrosine phosphatases. Recent structural studies of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B exposed to H2O2 have revealed a sulfenyl-amide species formed by cross-linking of the catalytic cysteine residue and an adjacent main chain nitrogen (28Salmeen A. Andersen J.N. Myers M.P. Meng T.C. Hinks J.A. Tonks N.K. Barford D. Nature. 2003; 423: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 29van Montfort R.L. Congreve M. Tisi D. Carr R. Jhoti H. Nature. 2003; 423: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Oxidation of the thiol to the sulfenyl-amide is associated with a conformational change in the active site of the enzyme that may inhibit substrate binding. These observations suggest that cross-linking of amino acid side chains to peptide amides may be a common structural motif in oxidized proteins. Our results indicate that HOCl selectively oxidizes the sequence motif WG and that the resulting formation of WG-4 associates strongly with oxidative inactivation of MMP-7 (14Fu X. Kassim S.Y. Parks W.C. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 20: 28403-28409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This finding complements our previous work (7Fu X. Kassim S.Y. Parks W.C. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41279-41287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), which showed that low concentrations of HOCl activate pro-MMP-7 by oxygenating a specific thiol residue in the prodomain of the enzyme. Such transient activation could be important for control of proteolytic activity during inflammation. Sequential MMP activation and inactivation could occur on or near phagocytes, which store MMPs and myeloperoxidase in secretory compartments and produce H2O2 at the cell membrane. Phagocytes therefore could create high local concentrations of oxidant-generating enzymes, substrates, and targets at the cell surface when they degranulate. Initial targeting of the cysteine switch thiol would rapidly activate the MMP, but sustained or high levels of HOCl production would modify other sites (7Fu X. Kassim S.Y. Parks W.C. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41279-41287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Once specific sites in the protein were modified, the MMP would lose its catalytic activity (14Fu X. Kassim S.Y. Parks W.C. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 20: 28403-28409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, oxidant production by phagocytes would strictly confine MMP activity in space and time, permitting only bursts of pericellular proteolysis. Our suggestion that HOCl inactivates MMP-7 by promoting the site-specific oxidation of WG to WG-4 provides an alternative mechanism for MMP inactivation, which is typically ascribed to protein inhibitors such as tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (1Woessner J.F. Nagase H. Matrix metalloproteinases and TIMPs. Oxford University Press, New York2000Google Scholar). Our observations suggest that phagocyte-derived oxidants may restrain proteolytic activity by site-specific modification of MMPs, raising the possibility that oxidative pathways play a physiological role in limiting the degradation of healthy tissue.

These proprotein convertases cleave proMT1-MMP after the R108RKR111 sequence to generate the active species (55 kDa). This is supported by studies using an engineered mutant of α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1-PI) with furin/PC inhibitory activity, designated α1-PIPDX (44Anderson E.D. Thomas L. Hayflick J.S. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24887-24891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to block proMT1-MMP zymogen activation (43Yana I. Weiss S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2387-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Active MT1-MMP is inhibited by TIMP-2, but is unaffected by TIMP-1 (34Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B. Murphy G. J.

MT1-MMP also undergoes autolytic degradation at Gly284↓Gly285 in the linker region, generating a catalytically inactive species (calculated molecular mass of 34 kDa) (39Hernandez-Barrantes S. Toth M.

Finally, as a trans-membrane protein, MT1-MMP is also regulated by membrane trafficking and cell surface localization (37Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The current study tested the hypothesis that glycosylation of MT1-MMP functions as an additional mechanism for post-translational regulation of enzymatic activity and demonstrates that MT1-MMP is an O-glycoprotein. Although glycosylation was not required for collagenase activity, formation of a stable MT1-MMP/TIMP-2/proMMP-2 ternary complex and subsequent cell surface activation of MMP-2 was blocked in glycosylation-defective mutants. Distinct glycoforms of MT1-MMP were detected in human cancer cell lines, suggesting that MT1-MMP activity may be regulated by differential glycosylation in vivo. These data support a model in which glycosylation regulates substrate targeting and suggest a cellular mechanism for controlling the initiation of MMP-2 dependent proteolysis. Materials—Anti-FLAG monoclonal M1 and M2 antibody, anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10), rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes the linker region of MT1-MMP, peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, gelatin, rat tail collagen, O-glycosylation inhibitor, benzyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-galactopyranoside (GalNAc-α-O-benzyl (BGN)), and N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin were purchased from Sigma. The broad spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 and rabbit polyclonal TIMP-2 antibody (AB801) were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Anti-transferrin receptor monoclonal antibody was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Human TIMP-2 and proMMP-2 were purified as previously described (48Toth M.

Sequence Analyses of MT-MMPs—The amino acid sequences of MT1- to MT6-MMP were obtained from Swiss-Prot P50281, P51511, P51512, Q9ULZ9, Q9Y5R2, and Q9NPA2, respectively. The prediction of O- and N-glycosylation sites was performed using full-length sequences on the NetOGlyc 2.0 server (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetOGlyc/) (50Hansen J.E. Lund O. Rapacki K. Brunak S.

Green, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL) and MDA-MB-231 cells (generous gift of Dr. V. Craig Jordan, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The ovarian cancer cell lines DOV13, OVCA429, and OVCA433 were kindly provided by Dr. Robert Bast, Jr. (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX), and were maintained in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell culture media and reagents were purchased from Mediatech (Herndon, VA). DNA Constructs—The human MT1-MMP cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Duanqing Pei (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN). The complete coding sequence of MT1-MMP was amplified by PCR using forward primer, 5′-ACCATGTCTCCCGCCCCAAGAC-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-TCAGACCTTGTCCAGCAGGGAAC-3′, and subcloned into eukaryotic expression vector pCR3.1-Uni (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to obtain the untagged wild type construct. The wild type construct was further FLAG (DYKDDDDK)-tagged in the stalk region (stalk) or after the furin/PC cleavage site (f112), or Myc (EQKLISEEDL)- tagged in the stalk region (Fig. 1B). Subsequently different deletions (ΔCat) or point mutations (E240A, CHO-1, CHO-3, and CHO-4; see below) were generated on the wild type cDNA and on the tagged constructs using a two-step overlapping PCR strategy. Briefly, two fragments covering the complete cDNA were generated in the first step PCR, with an overlapping region carrying tag or mutation(s). In the second step of PCR, both fragments were used as templates to generate the complete cDNA carrying the tag or mutation, followed by subcloning back into the pCR3.1-Uni vector using HindIII and EcoRI sites. The outer primers in this strategy are the sequencing primers provided by Invitrogen. The inner primers are 5′-GGCCGGCCGGATTATAAGGATGATGATGATAAGGAGGTGATCATCATTG-3′ and 5′-CAATGATGATCACCTCCTTATCATCATCATCCTTATATTCCGGCCGGCC-3′ for FLAGtag (stalk); 5′-GACTATAAAGATGATGATGATAAATACGCCATCCAGGGTCTCAAATG-3′ and 5′-TTTATCATCATCATCTTTATAATCGCGCTTCCTTCGAACATTGGC-3′ for FLAG tag (f112); 5′-GAACAAAAACTTATCAGTGAAGAAGATCTGGGCCGGCCGGATGAGfsGGGAC-3′ and 5′-CAGATCTTCTTCACTGATAAGTTTTTGTTCTCCCGATGGGCAGCCCATCC-3′ for Myc tag (stalk); 5′-GTCAGGGTTCCCCGCCAAGATGCCCCC-3′ and 5′GGGGGCATCTTGGCGGGGAACCCTGAC-3′ for CHO-1 (T291A); 5′-AGGGCTGCTGCTCGGCCTTCTGTTCCTGAT-3′ and 5′-GGCCGAGCAGCAGCCCTGGGTTGAGGGGGCAT-3′ for CHO-3 (T299A/T300A/S301A); 5′-GGTGGCTGTGCACGCGCTGGGCCATGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCATGGCCCAGCGCGTGCACAGCCACC-3′ for E240A; and 5′-CGAAGGAAGCGCGGTGAGTCAGGGTTCCCCACC-3′ and 5′-CCCTGACTCACCGCGCTTCCTTCGAACATTGGCC-3′ for ΔCat (Δ112-284). In addition to the above mutants of MT1-MMP, soluble FLAG-tagged (f112) MT1-MMP (sMT1-MMP) and CHO-4 mutant (sCHO-4) were also generated using TA cloning approach from the corresponding membrane-anchored constructs. The primers used to delete the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain (soluble) are forward primer (5′-ACCATGTCTCCCGCCCCAAGAC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-TCAAGCCGCGCTCACCGCCCCGCC-3′). The DNA constructs of wild type α1-PI and α1-PIPDX in pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) were generated by the laboratory of Dr. Guy S. Salvesen (Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA). The PCR reactions were performed using high fidelity Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Immunoprecipitation with Anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel—COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA indicated using FuGENE 6 (Roche, Switzerland) according to instructions from the manufacturer. After 24 h, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with 5 mm EDTA and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged proteins was performed using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel according to instructions from the manufacturer (Sigma) and Handee spin cup columns (Pierce). The cell lysates were incubated with M2 affinity gel at 4 °C for 2 h, washed three times with washing buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100, and eluted with 200 μg/ml 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma) in washing buffer. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments, EDTA was omitted from lysis buffer, and both lysis buffer and washing buffer were supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 and 2 mm MgCl2. The cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot and gelatin zymography as previously described (24Ellerbroek S.M. Wu Y.I. Overall C.M. Stack M.S. J. Biol.

Enzymatic Deglycosylation—Enzymatic deglycosylation was performed according to instructions from the manufacturer (ProZyme, San Leandro, CA). Briefly, FLAG-tagged MT1-MMP or glycosylation mutants were purified using M2 affinity gel as described above. The purified protein was heat-denatured in SDS buffer provided, neutralized with Triton X-100, and digested with buffer control or different glycosidases for 24 h. Several glycosidases, including sialidase A, endo-O-glycosidase, β(1-4)-galactosidase, glucosaminidase, and peptide-N-glycosidase F were used either individually or in combinations as described under “Results.” The digestion was stopped by boiling in SDS sample dilution buffer, and the samples were analyzed by Western blot. Lectin Precipitation Assay—Biotinylated lectins, including concanavalin A, soybean agglutinin, Ulex europaeus agglutinin I, wheat germ agglutinin, succinylated wheat germ agglutinin, Maackia amurensis lectin II, and Sambucus nigra lectin were purchased from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). These biotinylated lectins were immobilized by incubating with neutravidin-conjugated beads (Pierce) at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by three washes with washing buffer supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 and MgCl2. At the same time, cell lysates were prepared using lysis buffer without EDTA and supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 and MgCl2. These immobilized lectins were incubated with the cell lysates overnight, followed by washes with washing buffer containing 2 mm CaCl2 and MgCl2. The precipitated proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample dilution buffer and analyzed by Western blot. Collagen Invasion Assay—Collagen invasion assays were performed and analyzed as previously described (24Ellerbroek S.M. Wu Y.I. Overall C.M. Stack M.S. J. Biol.

Briefly, cell culture inserts (24 wells, 8.0-μm pore, Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA) were coated with rat tail type I collagen (10 μg/well) in 100 mm Na2CO3 and allowed to air-dry overnight. Collagen-coated inserts were then washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium three times to remove salts and used immediately. Transfected COS-7 cells were trypsinized, washed with cultured medium, and 1 × 105 cells were added to the inner invasion chamber in 250 μl of culture medium. The outer wells contained 400 μl of culture medium. To evaluate the MMP dependence of invasion, 25 μm GM6001 was added to the inner and outer chambers as indicated. Cells were allowed to invade for 24 h, non-invading cells were removed from inner wells using a cotton swab, and invading cells adherent to the bottom of membrane were fixed and stained using a Diff-Quick staining kit (Dade AG, Miami, FL). Invading cells were enumerated as described previously (24Ellerbroek S.M. Wu Y.I. Overall C.M. Stack M.S. J. Biol.

Transverse Urea Gradient (TUG) PAGE—TUG gel electrophoresis was performed as previously described (53Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Briefly, 7% polyacrylamide gels containing a continuous 0-8 m urea gradient were cast in batch using a multiple gradient caster (Owl Scientific, Woburn, MA). The gels were rotated 90°, and a single sample of purified protein, FLAG-tagged (f112) sMT1-MMP or sCHO-4 in a 200-μl total volume was loaded evenly across the top of the gel. Electrophoresis was performed in the absence of SDS. The fractionated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG M1 antibody (1:1000 dilution) and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution) followed by ECL detection (Pierce). Labeling and Purification of Cell Surface Proteins—Labeling of cell surface proteins was performed as described previously (40Munshi H.G. Wu Y.I. Ariztia E.V. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41480-41488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin (Pierce) for 10 min on ice and washed with 100 mm glycine to quench remaining NHS groups. The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer, incubated with neutravidin-conjugated beads (Pierce) for 1 h, and eluted by boiling in SDS sample dilution buffer for 15 min followed by Western blot analysis. Immunostaining of Endocytosed MT1-MMP—COS-7 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged (stalk) MT1-MMP, CHO-4, and E240A mutant in the presence of 25 μm GM6001. Cell surface FLAG-tagged proteins were labeled with FLAG/M2 antibody (1:1000 dilution) on ice for 1 h. The unbound antibody was washed off with medium, and 25 μm GM6001 alone or 25 μm GM6001 and 25 nm TIMP-2 were added back to the chamber slides. Cells were shifted to 37 °C to allow endocytosis to take place. After 15 min, the cells were placed on ice, washed with wash buffer (500 mm acetic acid and 150 mm NaCl) (47Uekita T. Itoh Y. Yana I. Ohno H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. The cells were further stained with rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sigma) that recognizes the linker domain of MT1-MMP (1:2000 dilution). The bound FLAG/M2 antibody and linker antibody were detected with corresponding secondary antibody (1:500 dilution) conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 and 546 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), respectively. The nucleus was counterstained with TO-PRO-3 iodide (Molecular Probes). The images were taken using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope at the Northwestern University Cell Imaging Faci"
https://openalex.org/W2011800776,"The sorting of apical proteins comprises an initial recognition step in the trans Golgi network and a final partitioning of the apical pool of proteins into at least two different types of vesicular carriers. One criteria of these carriers is the association or non-association of the protein content with lipid rafts. We have previously characterized a population containing the raft-associated sucrase-isomaltase-carrying vesicles (SAVs) and another one, the non-raft-associated lactase-phlorizin hydrolase-carrrying vesicles (LAVs) that are targeted separately to the apical membrane. Here, we demonstrate biochemically and by employing confocal laser microscopy that the annexin II-S100A10 complex is a component of SAVs and is absent from LAVs. The unequivocal role of annexin II in the apical targeting of SI is clearly demonstrated when down-regulation of this protein by annexin II-specific small interfering RNA drastically decreases the apical delivery of SI in the epithelial cell line Madin-Darby canine kidney.

The annexin II-S100A10 complex plays therefore a crucial role in routing SAVs to the apical membrane of epithelial cells. The plasma membrane of epithelial cells is divided into two domains, an apical domain facing the lumen and a basolateral domain contacting adjacent cells and the underlying connective tissue. Both membrane domains are separated by tight junctions and contain a specific protein and lipid composition (for review, see Ref. 1Mostov K. Su T. ter Beest M. Nat.

Simons K. Science. 1986; 234: 438-443Google Scholar). Basolateral sorting signals have been identified in the cytosolic tails of a variety of transmembrane proteins that could redirect heterologous reporter molecules to the basolateral cell surface (3Casanova J.E. Apodaca G. Mostov K.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 65-75Google Scholar, 4Honing S. Hunziker W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 321-332Google Scholar, 5Hunziker W. Harter C. Matter K. Mellman I.

The underlying sorting machinery is coupled to adaptor coat proteins that recognize these signals (7Folsch H. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. Mellman I. Cell. 1999; 99: 189-198Google Scholar, 8Simmen T. Honing S. Icking A. Tikkanen R. Hunziker W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 154-159Google Scholar). The apical sorting on the contrary is less well understood. In transmembrane proteins apical sorting signals have been detected in the cytosolic, transmembrane, and extracellular moiety of the polypeptide (9Chuang J.Z. Sung C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1245-1256Google Scholar, 10Jacob R. Preuss U. Panzer P. Alfalah M. Quack S. Roth M.G. Naim H. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8061-8067Google Scholar, 11Jacob R. Alfalah M.

Some early observations indicated that Triton X-100 insoluble lipid rafts are involved in this process, since most glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins associate with rafts and are apically targeted in epithelial cells (13Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Google Scholar, 14Lisanti M.P. Le Bivic A. Saltiel A.R. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 113: 155-167Google Scholar). It is assumed that lipid rafts originate in the Golgi and are then sent in raft-containing vesicles to the apical surface. For some transmembrane proteins the apical delivery does not involve their association with lipid rafts, which indicates that more than one type of sorting mechanism is responsible for the apical targeting of membrane proteins (15Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1596-1605Google Scholar, 16Zheng X. Lu D. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1596-1605Google Scholar). We monitored the exocytic apical transport pathways in living cells with two hydrolases of the intestinal brush border as model proteins, YFP-tagged sucrase-isomaltase (SI) as raft-associated marker and the non-raft associated CFP-tagged lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH) (17Jacob R. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1444-1450Google Scholar). Both marker proteins exit the TGN in post-Golgi carriers that pinch off two different vesicle populations, LPH-(LAVs) and SI-containing apical vesicles (SAVs). Furthermore, LAVs and SAVs segregate their cargo along different cytoskeletal tracks to the apical plasma membrane; in contrast to LAVs, SAVs also move along actin microfilaments to the cell surface and immunoisolation of SAVs revealed that they contain the actin motor protein myosin Ia (18Jacob R. Heine M. Alfalah M. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 607-612Google Scholar).In the present study we identified the association of annexin II as a new component of the raft-containing SAV vesicle population. Annexin II belongs to a family that is characterized by the presence of a conserved structural element, the so-called annexin repeat, and a Ca2+-dependent binding to phospholipids (for review, see Ref. 19Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Google Scholar). Annexin II itself has a heterotetrameric structure consisting of two annexin II molecules which are non-covalently attached to a S100A10 (p11) dimer (20Gerke V. Weber K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1688-1695Google Scholar). It has been previously published that this complex interacts with membranes of the endosomal system and harbors a C-terminal actin binding site (21Filipenko N.R. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5310-5315Google Scholar, 22Emans N. Gorvel J.P. Walter C. Gerke V. Kellner R. Griffiths G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1357-1369Google Scholar). The formation of the annexin tetramer as well as its interaction with endosomal membranes are independent of calcium (23Jost M. Zeuschner D. Seemann J. Weber K. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 221-228Google Scholar).Here we demonstrate the association of annexin II with exocytic SAV vesicles that have left the Golgi apparatus. The expression of annexin II is an absolute prerequisite for the delivery of SI to the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells, which indicates that annexin II plays an essential role in the exocytic transport of SAVs to the plasma membrane.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Reagents—Streptomycin, penicillin, glutamine, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), methionine-free DMEM (denoted Met-free medium), fetal calf serum, and trypsin were purchased from BioWest (Essen, Germany).

Cells were homogenized by using a stainless steel ball-bearing homogenizer in 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 1 mm MgAc2 or 5 mm EDTA for Ca2+-depletion experiments. Following step sucrose gradient centrifugation according to Greenfield et al. (25Greenfield J.P. Tsai J. Gouras G.K. Hai B. Thinakaran G. Checler F. Sisodia S.S. Greengard P. Xu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 742-747Google Scholar), six 2-ml fractions were collected from the top of each gradient and the first TGN-38 positive fractions were used for immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibody (mAb) anti-GFP (Clontech) or mAb anti-myc (Sigma). The samples were washed four times with HB-T buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm triethanolamine (pH 7.4)) prior to SDS-PAGE analysis.Protein Preparations for Mass Spectrometry—The immunoprecipitates were loaded on SDS gels followed by colloidal staining with Coomassie Blue, and single bands were cut out and transferred into an Eppendorf tube (26Neuhoff V. Stamm R. Pardowitz I. Arold N. Ehrhardt W. Taube D. Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 101-117Google Scholar). Trypsin digestion and mass spectrometric analysis of isolated proteins was performed by S. König (Proteomics Group, Integrated Functional Genomics, Interdisciplinary Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Münster, Germany).Immunochemical Reagents and Immunoblotting—Annexin II and S100A10 were detected with the mouse monoclonal antibodies H28 and H21 (27Osborn M. Johnsson N. Wehland J. Weber K. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 81-96Google Scholar). The anti-vimentin antibody was obtained from Immunotech. Immunoblotting employed polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Germany) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, which were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation of human SI a mixture of the mouse mAbs of hybridoma HBB 1/219, HBB 2/619, and HBB 3/705 was used (28Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Google Scholar). Human LPH was precipitated with mouse mAbs of hybridoma HBB 1/909 (28Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Google Scholar) and MLac 2, MLac 6, and MLac 8 (29Maiuri L. Raia V. Potter J. Swallow D. Ho M.W. Fiocca R. Finzi G. Cornaggia M. Capella C. Quaroni A.

Nature. 2002; 417: 653-656Google Scholar) was inserted into the pECFP-N1, pEYFP-N1, or pDsRed1-N1 vectors (Clontech) using the unique restriction sites BamHI and XhoI. A SacI/SmaI fragment encoding the complete cDNA of myosin Ia, which was generously provided by D. Bikle (UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center, San Francisco, CA) was inserted into pECFP-N1 (Clontech) using SacI and SmaI.Cell Culture, Biosynthetic Labeling of MDCK Cells, and Immunoprecipitation—COS-1 and MDCK cells were grown in DMEM medium (Invitrogen Corp.) with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C. Plasmid and siRNA transfection of COS-1 and MDCK cells was performed with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Metabolic labeling of MDCK-ML (30Jacob R. Brewer C. Fransen J.A. Naim H.Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8061-8067Google Scholar) cells with [35S]methionine for 4 h, and immunoprecipitation with mAb anti-SI was performed essentially as described before (30Jacob R. Brewer C. Fransen J.A. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2712-2721Google Scholar). For surface precipitation biosynthetically labeled cells were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in the presence of mAb anti-LPH or anti-SI followed by cell lysis and precipitation of the antigen-antibody complex with protein A-Sepharose by centrifugation. The precipitated aliquots were washed and mAb anti-LPH or anti-SI was added to the remaining supernatants to precipitate the internal mannose-rich and complex glycosylated stores of both enzymes. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to 6% SDS-PAGE and phosphoimages were analyzed with the Bio-Rad Quantity One software.Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—Confocal images of living cells were acquired on a Leica TCS SP2 microscope using a 63× water planapochromat lens (Leica Microsystems) essentially as described before (17Jacob R. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1444-1450Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo identify components that are involved in the transport and apical sorting process of LAVs and SAVs in epithelial cells, these post Golgi carriers were isolated separately from MDCK-LPHmyc and MDCK-SI-YFP cells as described previously (18Jacob R. Heine M. Alfalah M. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 607-612Google Scholar). Anti-myc was used for the immunoisolation of LAVs, while SAVs were precipitated with anti-GFP antibody. Subsequent SDS-PAGE analysis revealed a protein band of about 40 kDa in the SAV preparation that could not be detected in the LAV vesicles. Two separate matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analyses of this band revealed peak lists that corresponded to the trypsinized peptide pattern of the scaffolding protein annexin II with a molecular weight of 36 kDa (GenBank™ accession NP004030). This result was confirmed by immunoblots in which the 36-kDa band was detected exclusively in the SAV vesicles using a mAb anti-annexin antibody (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, antibodies directed against S100A10, the binding partner of annexin II, labeled a polypeptide of 11 kDa in the SAV fractions indicating that the complete heterotetrameric complex of annexin II and S100A10 is associated with the vesicular membrane of SAVs. The next step was to assess the stage in the secretory pathway at which annexin II and S100A10 become associated with SAV. For this MDCK-SI-YFP and MDCK-LPHmyc cells were subjected to different temperatures at which the protein trafficking could be blocked in particular compartments. The cells were either cultured for 6 h at 15 °C to accumulate pre-Golgi vesicular elements or at 20 °C to achieve an arrest of the proteins in the TGN (31Saraste J. Kuismanen E. Cell. 1984; 38: 535-549Google Scholar), which was followed by a 20 min TGN release at 37 °C. Vesicular fractions were isolated from the homogenates by sucrose-density centrifugation followed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblot. Fig. 1B demonstrates that the annexin II-S100A10 complex was detected exclusively on SI-carrying vesicles that were released from the TGN at 37 °C. Neither ER-nor Golgi-arrested material contained a component of the complex, which indicates that the annexin II-S100A10 tetramer attaches to SAVs after exit from the TGN.To examine the role of Ca2+ in the association of annexin II-S100A10 with post-Golgi vesicles we probed SAVs immunoisolated in the absence or presence of the Ca+-chelating agent EDTA by immunoblot with mAb anti-annexin II or mAb anti-S100A10. Fig. 1C shows that the coprecipitation of annexin II and S100A10 is not significantly affected when EDTA was included in the buffer used to isolate SAVs. This suggests that the annexin II tetramer still binds to SAVs at submicromolar Ca2+ concentrations. A similar observation was previously reported for the association of annexin II with early endosomes (23Jost M. Zeuschner D. Seemann J. Weber K. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 221-228Google Scholar).The binding of annexin II to post-Golgi vesicles was further assessed using confocal microscopy of COS-1 cells that were cotransfected with different variants of annexin II fused to CFP, YFP, or DsRed, which does not alter complex formation with S100A10 (24Zobiack N. Rescher U. Ludwig C. Zeuschner D. Gerke V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4896-4908Google Scholar), and either LPH-CFP or SI-YFP. One-day post-transfection the newly synthesized proteins were chased to the TGN at 20 °C followed by their release from this organelle at 37 °C. Finally, the cells were permeabilized to decrease the cytosolic background of annexin II before fixation. Confocal analysis revealed that annexin II, LPH, and SI were concentrated at the cell surface and in intracellular vesicular structures (Fig. 2). However, analysis of 216 vesicles of 15 cells cotransfected with LPH-CFP and annexin II-YFP revealed no overlap between LAVs, the vesicles stained by LPH, and annexin II (Fig. 2A), while from 353 vesicular carriers that were found in 15 cells cotransfected with SI-YFP and annexin II, about 70% were labeled with both markers (Fig. 2B). These data were further corroborated in COS-1 cells that have been cotransfected with the cDNAs of annexin II fused to DsRed, SI-YFP, and the actin motor protein myosin 1a fused to CFP. The latter protein has been previously demonstrated to be associated with SAVs (18Jacob R. Heine M. Alfalah M. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 607-612Google Scholar). Fig. 2C shows the distinct labeling patterns of each of the transfected genes within the same cells and at the same time demonstrates that all three proteins could be detected together on some vesicular structures located outside the Golgi. This is in line with previous biochemical data in which a colocalization of annexin II and myosin 1a to SAVs was demonstrated (18Jacob R. Heine M. Alfalah M. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 607-612Google Scholar). In eight of ten cells we also observed a significant staining of annexin II and myosin 1a in areas of the plasma membrane suggesting an association of a pool of these proteins with the plasma membrane.Fig. 2Confocal analysis of annexin II and LPH or SI in transiently transfected COS-1 cells. COS-1 cells were transfected with LPH-CFP and anx2-YFP (A) or SI-YFP and anx2-CFP (B) or SI-YFP, anx2-DsRed, and myo1A-CFP (C). One day post-transfection the cells were incubated for 4 h at 20 °C to accumulate proteins in the Golgi apparatus followed by a TGN release at 37 °C for 20 min. This incubation was performed in the presence of 1.6 mm cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis. The red arrows and arrowheads indicate transport vesicles stained by annexin II; white arrowheads depict labeling at the plasma membrane.

A polarized monolayer of MDCK-anxDs cells was analyzed by confocal microscopy and revealed an accumulation of annexin II-DsRed in the cortical apical and basolateral domains as well as in intracellular vesicular structures (Fig. 3A). This corroborates previous observations of the subcellular distribution of the annexin II-S100A10 complex in MDCK cells (32Harder T. Gerke V. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1119-1132Google Scholar) and suggests an involvement of this complex in transport processes to the apical as well as the basolateral membranes.Fig. 3SiRNA-mediated annexin II gene silencing inhibits the apical surface delivery of SI in polarized MDCK cells.A, distribution and depletion of annexin II in MDCK cells. Membraneous (ar-rowheads) and cytosolic (arrows) staining of anx2-DsRed is depicted in confocal x/y-scans, transmitted light, or x/z-scans of polarized MDCK-anx2Ds cells. Anx2-DsRed is specifically depleted in MDCK-anx2Ds cells, while no effect was observed by nonspecific luciferase siRNA. B, Western blot of annexin II and vimentin from cell lysates of MDCK-SI cells transfected or non-transfected with siRNA. C, MDCK-SI were grown on transmembrane filters and biosynthetically labeled with [35S]methionine for 4 h in the presence or absence of RNAi. Cell surface immunoprecipitation of SI from the apical (a) or basolateral (b) membranes was performed with mAb anti-SI. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by phosphoimaging analysis. D, the proportions of mannose-rich (SIh) and complex glycosylated SI (SIc) from three independent experiments were quantified. MDCK (E) or COS-1 (F) cells were transiently transfected with SI-YFP and annexin II siRNA. The cells were treated as described for Fig. 2 and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Arrows indicate the intracellular accumulation of SI-YFP-positive vesicles after siRNA treatment. Membraneous SI-YFP staining could be observed in the control experiment with luciferase siRNA. Scale bars, 10 μm; ap, apical; n, nucleus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In this context it has been proposed that cytosolic annexin II acts as a link between the actin-cytoskeleton and endocytic or exocytic membranes (33Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Google Scholar). To determine whether this linker plays a role in the intracellular dynamics of SAVs, we reduced intracellular annexin II in MDCK-anxDs cells by RNAi to specifically suppress annexin II. A dramatic reduction of annexin II-DsRed in the RNAi-treated samples is indicated in Fig. 3A, which is comparable with the observations made by Zobiack et al. (24Zobiack N. Rescher U. Ludwig C. Zeuschner D. Gerke V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4896-4908Google Scholar) with the corresponding RNAi construct. In a further approach RNAi was applied to decrease the amount of annexin II in MDCK cells expressing SI. After transfection of doublestranded annexin-siRNA into polarized cells grown on filter membranes, we analyzed the apical or basolateral delivery of SI by surface immunoprecipitation. By reducing the intracellular levels of annexin II the proportion of SI that has been delivered to the apical domain is significantly decreased (Fig. 3, C and D). Nevertheless, a shift in the polarity behavior of SI to the basolateral membrane did not occur by annexin II depletion. This indicates that annexin II is involved in the transport process and not in the sorting event of SI.The observation that only a minor proportion of newly synthesized SI reaches the apical membrane after RNAi treatment raised the question for the final destination of SI under annexin II depleted conditions. Therefore, we applied RNAi on MDCK-SI-YFP cells. SI-YFP fluorescence was monitored after a temperature-dependent TGN exit as described above. In siRNA-transfected cells fluorescent staining of the apical membrane was significantly decreased, and SI-YFP-labeled vesicular structures appeared intracellularly (Fig. 3E). This suggests that annexin II depletion leads to the accumulation of SI-YFP in intracellular compartments. For a better resolution on a single focal plane, we further cotransfected COS-1 cells with an SI-YFP expression plasmid and annexin II siRNA. Here, we could also identify intracellular, submembraneous vesicles that were accumulated in the cellular periphery (Fig. 3F). However, the cell membrane was not labeled by SI-YFP. Taken together, the biochemical and confocal data indicate that a decrease in annexin II results in a blockade of the intracellular transport of raft-containing SAVs at a stage before vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane occurs. In fact it is well known that the annexin II-S100A10 tetramer interacts with lipid rafts in a cholesterol-dependent manner (34Oliferenko S. Paiha K. Harder T. Gerke V. Schwarzler C. Schwarz H. Beug H. Gunthert U. Huber L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 843-854Google Scholar), and it has been published recently that S100A10 is also implicated in membrane trafficking of the background K+ channel TASK-1, the epithelial Ca2+ channels TRPV5 and TRPV6, and the tetrodotoxin-insensitive voltage-gated Na+ channel (35Girard C. Tinel N. Terrenoire C. Romey G. Lazdunski M. Borsotto M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4439-4448Google Scholar, 36Okuse K. Malik-Hall M. Baker M.D. Poon W.Y. Kong H. Chao M.V. Wood J.N.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1478-1487Google Scholar). In the latter case it binds directly to the amino terminus of the Na+ channel and promotes the translocation of this transmembrane protein to the plasma membrane, producing functional channels (36Okuse K. Malik-Hall M. Baker M.D. Poon W.Y. Kong H. Chao M.V. Wood J.N. Nature. 2002; 417: 653-656Google Scholar). A different binding motif, however, is required at the C termini of TASK-1, TRPV5 and TRPV6 for a specific interaction with S100A10 (35Girard C. Tinel N. Terrenoire C. Romey G. Lazdunski M. Borsotto M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4439-4448Google Scholar, 37van de Graaf S.F. Hoenderop J.G. Gkika D. Lamers D. Prenen J. Rescher U. Gerke V. Staub O. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1478-1487Google Scholar).As a conclusion our observations suggest a role for the annexin II-S100A10 complex in the trafficking of SI to the apical membrane of epithelial cells. Whether the SI polypeptide interacts directly with the complex or through a network of associated partners in raft-transporting SAVs remains to be elucidated. Annexin II is not the only member of the annexin superfamily that is involved in apical trafficking. Previous data demonstrated the function of annexin 13b in the delivery of the influenza virus hemagglutinin from the TGN to the apical plasma membrane (38Fiedler K. Lafont F. Parton R.G. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1043-1053Google Scholar, 39Lafont F. Lecat S. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1413-1427Google Scholar), which further suggests the presence of different apical transport pathways with diverse mechanisms in epithelial cells. The plasma membrane of epithelial cells is divided into two domains, an apical domain facing the lumen and a basolateral domain contacting adjacent cells and the underlying connective tissue. Both membrane domains are separated by tight junctions and contain a specific protein and lipid composition (for review, see Ref. 1Mostov K. Su T. ter Beest M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 287-293Google Scholar).

Simons K. Science. 1986; 234: 438-443Google Scholar).

Dynamin family functions include the scission of clathrin-coated pits from the plasma membrane, mitochondrial fission, and chloroplast division. Here we report that the divergent eukaryote Trypanosoma brucei possesses a single dynamin family gene, which we have designated TbDLP. Furthermore, a single dynamin family gene is also found in the Leishmania major and Trypanosoma vivax genomes, indicating that this is a conserved feature among the kinetoplastida. TbDLP is most homologous to the DMN/DRP family of dynamin-like proteins. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy reveals that TbDLP is distributed in punctate structures within the cell that partially co-localize with the mitochondrion when labeled with MitoTracker. To define TbDLP function, we have used RNA interference to silence the TbDLP gene. Reduction of TbDLP protein levels causes a profound alteration in mitochondrial morphology without affecting the structure of other membrane-bound compartments, including the endocytic and exocytic apparatus. The mitochondrial profiles present in wild type trypanosomes fuse and collapse in the mutant cells, and by electron microscopy the mitochondria are found to contain an accumulation of constriction sites. These findings demonstrate TbDLP functions in division of the mitochondrial membrane. Most significantly, as TbDLP is the sole member of the dynamin family in this organism, scission of clathrin-coated pits involved in protein trafficking through the highly active endocytic system in trypanosomes must function in the absence of dynamin.

The kinetoplastida protozoa of the Trypanosoma brucei group are significant as one of the earliest diverging eukaryotic lineages that contain a single mitochondrion (1Sogin M.L. Silberman J.D. Int. J. Parasitol. 1998; 28: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Given their extreme evolutionary distance, estimated at a divergence time of ∼3 billion years from the crown eukaryotes, it is not unexpected that these organisms display many unusual biological features. One example is a unique configuration of the mitochondrial genome, the kinetoplast DNA, which is composed of several thousand DNA circles catenated into a single network (2Chen J. Rauch C.A. White J.H. Englund P.T. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 61-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This network is condensed into a disk-shaped structure in the matrix of the single mitochondrion of the cell and is structurally linked to the flagellar basal bodies through a trans-membrane complex (3Robinson D.R.

Numerous dynamin-like proteins (DLPs) have also been identified, which are quite diverse with regard to sequence and to biological function but share critical roles in membrane remodeling (16Danino D.

A, schematic representation of the protein domains of dynamin homologues. Human dynamin 1 (HsDYN1) is involved in endocytosis and is the prototype member of the family; it possesses a GTPase domain for GTP binding and hydrolysis, a middle conserved domain (Dyn_2), a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a GTPase effector domain (GED) for self-assembly, anda proline-rich domain (PRD) at the C terminus. The second structural group, comprising S. cerevisiae ScMGM1 and human HsOPA1, is involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology and localizes to the mitochondrial inner membrane via a leader sequence (mitochondrial leader, ML). The third group contains yeast ScDNM1, which is required for mitochondrial division, ScVPS1, involved in vesicular transport and TbDLP. TbDLP, like other proteins from this subfamily, lacks a pleckstrin homology and proline-rich domain. DLPs also have an additional insert, annotated as A and B. Regions of similar sequence are shown with the same shading. Amino acid numbering for HsDYN1 is shown at top. B, sequence alignment of dynamin-like proteins ScDNM1, ScVPS1, HsDLP1, and TbDLP. Conserved residues are boxed, and conservative mutations are shaded. TbDLP, like the ScMGM proteins, lacks an insert in the N-terminal GTPase domain found in ScVPS and ScDNM DLPs (underlined). C, phylogenetic analysis demonstrates TbDLP is a member of the mitochondrial dividing dynamin-like protein family. The clades highlighted are as follows: DLPs that function in outer chloroplast membrane (OCM); DLPs located in the mitochondrial space involved in modulating the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM); dynamins that participate in vesicular trafficking of clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane (CCV); DLPs that are predominantly involved in outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) fission (this group also contains the yeast proteins involved in CCV traffic), plant DLPs that are involved in cell plate formation (cell division), and release of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCV). The more divergent member is the MxA protein that combats viral infection in vertebrates and the yeast MGM protein. GenBank™ accession numbers for the proteins used in this analysis are as follows: A. thaliana ARC5 (AAO89221); C. merolae DNM2 (AY162473.1), Homo sapiens OPA (Z47808), C. elegans MGM1 (AB011139), D. melanogaster DLPB (NP_610941), H. sapiens DNM1 (NM004408), D. melanogaster DMN (NP_727910), C. elegans DNM1 (AF167982), S. cerevisiae DNM1 (L40588), H. sapiens Drp1 (AF000430), D. melanogaster DLPA (NP_608694), C. elegans Drp1 (AF166274), D. discoideum DYNA (CAA67983), C. merolae DNM1 (AAO23012), A. thaliana ADL2b (AB072375), S. cerevisiae VPS1 (M33315), A. nidulans VPSA (AB074883.1), Leishmania major DLP (Sanger CHR29_tmp.127c), T. brucei DLP (AF156167.1; Sanger 62.m00230 and 62.m00222), T. vivax DLP (Tviv273e05.q1k, Tviv604h09.p1k, Tviv143a08.q1k, Tviv120g02.q1k, and Tviv58h12.p1k), Giardia intestinalis VPSA (AAL87662), A. thaliana ADL1 L36939, Glycine max (U25547), A. thaliana ADL3 (AB026987), A. thaliana ADL6 (AF180732), H. sapiens MxA (P20591), and S. cerevisiae MGM1 (X62834). The dynamin-related E. coli protein YjdA (J05620) was used as outgroup. These sequences were aligned using the ClustalX package, and the phylogenetic tree was calculated by the N-J method in PAUP (34Swofford D.L. PAUP Version 4.0. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1998Google Scholar). The bootstrap values based on 1,000 replicates are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Sequence homology within the dynamin family is primarily restricted to the GTPase and middle domains. DLPs generally lack the pleckstrin homology domain and proline/arginine-rich domains but contain several insertions relative to dynamin (Fig. 1A) (17van der Bliek A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 96-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The most comprehensively characterized DLPs are the three encoded by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, VPS1, DNM1, and MGM. Vps1p is associated with the Golgi complex, is required for proper sorting of proteins to the yeast vacuole (18Vater C.A. Raymond C.K. Ekena K. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and has also been implicated in peroxisome abundance and inheritance (19Hoepfner D. van den Berg M. Philippsen P. Tabak H.F. Hettema E.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 979-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Dnm1p is mostly cytosolic and functions primarily in the maintenance of yeast mitochondrial network morphology (20Otsuga D. Keegan B.R. Brisch E. Thatcher J.W. Hermann G.J. Bleazard W. Shaw J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 21Bleazard W. McCaffery J.M. King E.J. Bale S. Mozdy A. Tieu Q. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 5: 298-304Crossref Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Mgm1p is located in the intermitochondria space and is required for maintenance of fusion-competent mitochondria (22Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Gorsich S.W. McCaffery J.M. Shaw J.M. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar).The exact mechanism underpinning the function of dynamin in membrane remodeling is the subject of much debate (23Song B.D. Schmid S.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1369-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Dynamins are able to spontaneously self-assemble in vitro into rings and spirals when provided with a suitable lipid template. Upon the addition of GTP, the dynamin rings alter pitch and constrict (24Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 25Takei K. Haucke V. Slepnev V. Farsad K. Salazar M. Chen H. De Camilli P. Cell. 1998; 94: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). This observation leads to the hypothesis that dynamin is a force-generating mechano-enzyme. Alternatively, analysis of the dynamin GTPase effector domain leads to a second model of dynamin action suggesting that the protein may function as a classical regulatory GTPase that recruits and/or activates additional effector molecules responsible for membrane scission (26Sever S. Muhlberg A.B. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1999; 398: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar).Trypanosomes possess a highly active endocytic system capable of carrying out the clathrin-dependent recycling of plasma membrane proteins (27Morgan G.W. Allen C.L. Jeffries T.R. Hollinshead M. Field M.C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2605-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Allen C.L. Goulding D. Field M.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4991-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of a trypanosomal DLP (TbDLP) with high homology to yeast dynamin-like proteins VPS1 and DNM1. Data base interrogation indicates that kinetoplastid protozoa are unique in having a single DLP encoded in their genome. Our data demonstrate that TbDLP, like yeast DNM1 and MGM, functions in the regulation of mitochondrial membrane division. Hence, trypanosomes are able to carry out clathrin-mediated endocytosis in the absence of a dynamin-like GTPase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTrypanosome Cells and Culture—PCF and BSF cells, strain 427, were maintained in SDM79 and HMI9 media, respectively, as described previously (29Field H. Field M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10498-10505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The inducible cell lines PCF 29-13 and BSF 90-13 were obtained from George Cross (Rockefeller University) and maintained as described (30Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar).Data Base Searches, DNA Cloning, and Manipulation—We identified a trypanosomal EST fragment (GenBank™ accession number T26974) most homologous to yeast VPS1 from a search of the TIGR T. brucei Genome Project (www.tigr.org/tdb/mdb/tbdb/) by using the BLAST algorithm (31Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69088) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment was PCR-amplified from T. brucei genomic DNA using specific primers (5′-TGGATTCCTTCCTTCTCGTGGT-3′ and 5′-AGTGTCCAAGCACTTCCGTT-3′) designed against the T26974 EST and subcloned. This fragment was radiolabeled and used to probe a T. brucei λFIX genomic library by filter hybridization (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) to obtain the entire trypanosomal dynamin-like protein (TbDLP) ORF. The TbDLP sequence was submitted to GenBank™ (GenBank™ accession number AF156167). The entire TbDLP ORF has also been independently identified by the trypanosomal genome projects at the Sanger Institute (Tb03.48K5.290 and Tb03.48K5.360) and TIGR (62.m00222 and 62.m00230), which is present as two copies.Generation of Constructs—PCR was performed with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). PCR products were subcloned using the PCR-Script Amp cloning kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced with the “BigDye” terminator chemistry version 3.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and a semiautomated sequencer (ABI 377; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Bioinformatics—Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic tree analyses were performed using the ClustalX multiple alignment program (33Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35195) Google Scholar), and phylogenetic reconstruction was done using PAUP release 4.0* (Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony) (34Swofford D.L. PAUP Version 4.0. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1998Google Scholar) with at least 1,000 bootstrap replications. GenBank™ accession numbers for the sequences used in these analyses are given in the legend to Fig. 1.RNA Interference—An RNAi construct was made using the vector p2T7Ti (35LaCount D.J. Bruse S. Hill K.L. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), which allows for stable tetracycline-inducible expression of double-stranded RNA from a T7 promoter in T. brucei 29-13 procyclic and BSF Lister 427 bloodstream form cell lines. A 475-bp HindIII/SacI TbDLP fragment was subcloned into the corresponding sites of p2T7Ti.Antibody Production—TbDLP antiserum was generated against an N-terminal peptide (residues 12-25, CHDAFANVKMNIKLN which includes an N-terminal C, not present in the native sequence, for coupling) in rabbits and mice. Antibodies were affinity-purified on antigen immobilized on cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) by using standard procedures (36Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were washed in PBS and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS, pH 7.5, for 10 min (BSF) or 1 h (PCF) on ice as described previously (27Morgan G.W. Allen C.L. Jeffries T.R. Hollinshead M. Field M.C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2605-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All further manipulations were performed at room temperature. Mitochondrial morphology was assessed by incubating cultures in MitoTracker Green FM/Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 5 min prior to live cell imaging or fixation. Concanavalin A (ConA) uptake was performed as described previously (37Brickman M.J. Cook J.M. Balber A.E. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3611-3621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ConA was bound by incubation of cells in serum-free medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml fluorescein ConA (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at 4 °C for 30 min before washing and direct transfer to 37 °C for internalization. Cells were examined using a Nikon ECLIPSE E600 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Nikon digital DMX 1200 camera (Nikon Europe B.V., AE Badhoev, The Netherlands). Digital images were captured using Nikon ACT-1 software and assembled using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA).Western Blots—1 × 107 cells per lane were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by wet transfer. Filters were processed as described (29Field H. Field M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10498-10505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Electron Microscopy—For transmission EM, cells were fixed in suspension by adding chilled 5% glutaraldehyde and 8% PFA in PBS in a 1:1 ratio to the growth medium containing trypanosomes. Cells were pelleted and incubated with fresh fixative for a further 50 min. The pellet was rinsed in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h. After rinsing, cells were dehydrated in an ethanol series, adding 1% uranyl acetate at the 30% stage, followed by propylene oxide, and then embedded in Epon/Araldite. Sections were cut on a Leica Ultracut T ultramicrotome, contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. For cryosectioning, cells were fixed in suspension by adding chilled 0.4% glutaraldehyde and 8% PFA in PBS in a 1:1 ratio to the growth medium containing trypanosomes to give final dilutions of 0.2% glutaraldehyde and 4% PFA. Cells were fixed for 10 min on ice and centrifuged, and the supernatant was replaced for fresh fixative for a further 50 min on ice to fix the pellet. The cells were then rinsed three times in cold PBS for 15 min and then infused with freshly prepared 2.3 m sucrose in cold PBS between 8 h and overnight prior to freezing in liquid nitrogen and storage in a refrigerator. Thin sections of frozen cells were cut and processed for immunogold labeling, after free aldehyde groups were blocked by incubation with 0.05 m glycine for 5 min. The sections were then incubated with the TbDLP antibody, which was visualized using protein A-gold 10-nm conjugates. All sections were examined on a Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope.RESULTSIdentification of a Trypanosomal Dynamin-like Protein—Interrogation of the T. brucei genome project data bases with a collection of dynamin and dynamin-like protein sequences by BLAST identified an EST fragment (GenBank™ accession number T26974) with homology to the yeast dynamin-like protein VPS1 (18Vater C.A. Raymond C.K. Ekena K. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Screening a λFIX T. brucei library allowed the isolation of a genomic clone containing the corresponding full-length open reading frame (1983 bp) that encoded a 661-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 73.3 kDa. The entire TbDLP ORF has also been sequenced by the trypanosomal genome projects at Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (Tb03.48K5.290 and Tb03.48K5.360) and the Institute for Genomic Research (62.m00222 and 62.m00230). The protein contains structural domains present in other dynamin family members including the dynamin catalytic family motif (pfam00350, residues 2-213), dynamin 2 central region (pfam01031, residues 214-498), and the dynamin GTPase effector domain (pfam02212, residues 571-635). A schematic representation of the protein domains of the dynamin protein family is shown in Fig. 1A. The nearest TbDLP homologue identified using BLAST is Dictyostelium discoideum DymA (38Wienke D.C. Knetsch M.L. Neuhaus E.M. Reedy M.C. Manstein D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 225-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which exhibits ∼65% homology and ∼49% similarity. As shown in Fig. 1B, TbDLP (like the ScMgm protein) lacks inserts in the N-terminal GTPase domain (underlined) that occur in ScVps1 and ScDnm1 DLPs (17van der Bliek A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 96-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar).TbDLP is single copy gene by Southern blot analysis, and no related genes could be detected under low stringency conditions (data not shown). This was unexpected as most organisms investigated to date have at least two DLP family members in their genome. To verify this finding, we extensively searched all available T. brucei genomic EST and GSS data bases with both the TbDLP sequence and the dynamin family sequences utilized in the original search, but we failed to identify any further DLP homologues in T. brucei. By contrast, we recovered full-length sequence homologues of TbDLP in the genome data bases of related organisms, specifically Leishmania major (CHR29_tmp.127c) and Trypanosoma vivax (Tviv273e05.q1k, Tviv604h09.p1k, Tviv143a08.q1k, Tviv120g02.q1k, and Tviv58h12.p1k). These organisms do not contain additional DLP sequences, and hence possession of a single DLP appears to be a widespread feature among the kinetoplastida.Phylogenetic reconstruction using PAUP (34Swofford D.L. PAUP Version 4.0. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1998Google Scholar) demonstrated that the dynamin protein family forms several discrete clades (Fig. 1C). Importantly, these clades contain functionally related dynamin family members and are defined by Arabidopsis thaliana ARC5 and Cyanidioschyzon merolae DNM2, which function in outer chloroplast membrane division; human OPA1, Drosophila DLPB, and Caenorhabditis elegans MGM1, which function in remodeling of the inner mitochondrial membrane; numerous dynamins required for the release of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs), higher plant proteins involved in formation of the cell plate during division (A. thaliana DLP1/G. max PDL1), and a separate clade functioning in CCV release (A. thaliana DLP3/4). Additional members of the dynamin family include the Mx family of proteins involved in vertebrate response to viral infection and the yeast MGM1 protein required for mitochondrial genome maintenance and morphology of the inner mitochondrial membrane. The tree was generated using the Escherichia coli protein YjdA, which shares characteristics of dynamin family members as outgroup (17van der Bliek A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 96-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar).Typanosomal DLP segregates with the largest group of DLPs that contains sequences from metazoans, fungi, algae, and protozoa involved in the division of the outer mitochondrial membrane, suggesting a role in this process for TbDLP. This group also contains the yeast protein VPS1 that functions in vacuolar sorting and peroxisome biogenesis. Given the early divergence of trypanosomatids during eukaryotic evolution, the presence of dynamin-like proteins in this lineage indicates kinetoplastid dynamins predate eukaryotic speciation and suggests that this role may represent the original function for the dynamin family of proteins.Characterization of TbDLP Expression and Specific Antibodies—Northern blot analysis of BSF and PCF demonstrates TbDLP mRNA is expressed as a single transcript of 2.1 kb in both life cycle stages (data not shown). To characterize the TbDLP protein, we generated antisera in rabbits and mice against the N-terminal peptide residues 12-25, CHDAFANVKMNIKLN, which following affinity purification were characterized in detail and yielded identical data. By Western blot analysis of BSF and PCF lysates, the sera were found to identify a single band of ∼73 kDa which is expressed at slightly higher levels in the PCF than the BSF (Fig. 2A). Equivalence of loading was confirmed by reprobing the filter with antibody against T. brucei BiP, which has been demonstrated previously to be expressed at ∼3-fold more in BSF compared with PCF (39Bangs J.D. Uyetake L. Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. Boothroyd J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1101-1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 2Characterization of antibodies against TbDLP. A, protein extracts from BSF and PCF analyzed by Western blotting with anti-TbDLP. Trypanosomal binding protein (TbBiP) is used as a loading control. B, immunofluorescence images of PCF and BSF cells stained with antibodies against TbDLP show TbDLP is located at punctate structures distributed throughout the cell.

https://openalex.org/W2016252658,"We have reported previously that protein kinase C (PKC) signaling can mediate a program of cell cycle withdrawal in IEC-18 nontransformed intestinal crypt cells, involving rapid disappearance of cyclin D1, increased expression of Cip/Kip cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, and activation of the growth suppressor function of pocket proteins (Frey, M. R., Clark, J. A., Leontieva, O., Uronis, J. M., Black, A. R., and Black, J. D. (2000) J. Cell Biol. 151, 763–777). In the current study, we present evidence to support a requisite role for PKC α in mediating these effects. Furthermore, analysis of the signaling events linking PKC/PKC α activation to changes in the cell cycle regulatory machinery implicate the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. PKC/PKC α activity promoted GTP loading of Ras, activation of Raf-1, and phosphorylation/activation of ERK. ERK activation was found to be required for critical downstream effects of PKC/PKC α activation, including cyclin D1 down-regulation, p21Waf1/Cip1 induction, and cell cycle arrest. PKC-induced ERK activation was strong and sustained relative to that produced by proliferative signals, and the growth inhibitory effects of PKC agonists were dominant over proliferative events when these opposing stimuli were administered simultaneously. PKC signaling promoted cytoplasmic and nuclear accumulation of ERK activity, whereas growth factor-induced phospho-ERK was localized only in the cytoplasm. Comparison of the effects of PKC agonists that differ in their ability to sustain PKC α activation and growth arrest in IEC-18 cells, together with the use of selective kinase inhibitors, indicated that the length of PKC-mediated cell cycle exit is dictated by the magnitude/duration of input signal (i.e. PKC α activity) and of activation of the ERK cascade. The extent/duration of phospho-ERK nuclear localization may also be important determinants of the duration of PKC agonist-induced growth arrest in this system. Taken together, the data point to PKC α and the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade as key regulators of cell cycle withdrawal in intestinal epithelial cells.

Studies in several systems, including self-renewing epithelial tissues (i.e. intestinal mucosa and epidermis), several leukemic cell lines, and melanoma cells increasingly point to a role for sustained PKC signaling in mediating cell cycle exit and cell differentiation (see Ref. 1Black J.D. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D406-D423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for review). Mechanistic studies in intestinal (5Frey M.R. Clark J.A. Leontieva O. Uronis J.M. Black A.R. Black J.D. J.

Dermatol. 2002; 119: 1282-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) epithelial systems have shown that activation of PKC α, in particular, is sufficient to trigger a program of cell cycle withdrawal, involving inhibition of G1/S cyclin-dependent kinase activity and coordinated alterations in the expression/activity of members of the pocket protein family (i.e. p107, pRb, and p130). Studies in erythroleukemia cells (7Hocevar B.A. Morrow D.M. Tykocinski M.L. Fields A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 671-679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), myeloid cells (8Mischak H. Pierce J.H.

Whereas the cell cycle-specific and growth regulatory effects of PKC α signaling have been well characterized in these systems, the events linking PKC α activation to changes in the cell cycle regulatory machinery remain largely unknown. The current study investigated the downstream events of negative growth regulatory PKC signaling using intestinal epithelial cells as a model system. Based on (a) evidence for the ability of PKC agonists (10Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and individual members of the PKC family (11Schonwasser D.C. Marais R.M. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Mol. Cell.

This three-kinase cascade, consisting of Raf, MAP kinase/ERK kinase (MEK), and ERKs 1 and 2, is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells and, like PKC, has been widely implicated in control of cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and transformation (10Lewis T.S.

ERK1/2 and their upstream regulators are acutely stimulated by the interaction of growth or differentiation factors with cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases, heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors, or cytokine receptors (10Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chen Z. Gibson T.B. Robinson F. Silvestro L. Pearson G. Xu B. Wright A. Vanderbilt C. Cobb M.H. Chem.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the pathway is often dependent on the activity of the monomeric G protein Ras, which can play an important role in the activation of Raf (19Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3447) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence indicates that the strength and duration of the ERK signal plays a critical role in determining cellular response to activation of this pathway (20Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar, 21Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem.

Transient or cyclical ERK activation has been linked to cell cycle progression, whereas sustained levels of ERK activity can lead to cell growth arrest and differentiation. ERK activation can influence both nuclear and cytosolic events. On stimulation, ERKs can translocate to the nucleus where they phosphorylate transcription factors and thus regulate gene expression (23Su B. Karin M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Other ERK targets include membrane and cytoplasmic proteins, such as downstream kinases and cytoskeletal proteins (10Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chen Z. Gibson T.B. Robinson F. Silvestro L. Pearson G. Xu B. Wright A. Vanderbilt C. Cobb M.H. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2449-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that activation of PKC/PKC α in IEC-18 nontransformed intestinal crypt cells results in cell cycle withdrawal. By using pharmacological inhibitors of PKC and ERK signaling, we now show that PKC α plays a key role in PKC agonist-induced cell cycle arrest in IEC-18 cells and that ERK signaling is required for critical downstream cell cycle-specific effects of PKC/PKC α activation, including down-regulation of cyclin D1, induction of p21Waf1/Cip1, and cell cycle exit. We further demonstrate that PKC-mediated IEC-18 cell cycle arrest involves strong and sustained ERK signaling and that the duration of growth arrest is determined by the extent/duration of input signal, i.e. PKC α activity, and of activation of the ERK pathway. The magnitude and duration of nuclear phospho-ERK activity also appear to be important determinants of the length of the effect. Notably, PKC/PKC α stimulation is shown to promote both Ras and Raf activity in IEC-18 cells, and maintenance of ERK signaling in this system correlates with the duration of activation of these molecules. Materials—Mouse monoclonal antibody specific for PKC α was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Polyclonal rabbit anti-PKC δ (C-17) and anti-PKC ∈ (C-15) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The antibodies used in this study have been characterized previously for the absence of cross-reactivity with other PKC isozymes (5Frey M.R. Clark J.A. Leontieva O. Uronis J.M. Black A.R. Black J.D.

Cell Culture, Cell Synchronization, and PKC Activation/Depletion Protocols—The IEC-18 cell line (ATCC CRL-1589) is an immature, nontransformed cell line derived from rat ileal epithelium that maintains many characteristics of proliferating intestinal crypt cells (25Quaroni A. May R.J. Methods Cell Biol. 1980; : 403-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These cells express the phorbol ester/diacylglycerol-responsive PKC isozymes α, δ, and ∈, and the atypical PKC isozymes ζ and ι (26Frey M.R. Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Rollins A. Evans S.S. Black J.D. J.

IEC-18 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 4 mm glutamine, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were synchronized in G0/G1 by incubation in 0.5% serum for 72 h as we have described previously (26Frey M.R. Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Rollins A. Evans S.S. Black J.D. J. Biol.

More than 90% of cells were arrested in G0/G1 by this method, as determined by flow cytometric analysis. Cells were released from G0/G1 arrest by addition of complete growth medium containing 5% serum and 10 μg/ml insulin. PKC α, δ, and ∈ were activated in IEC-18 cells by treatment with either 100 nm PMA, 20 μg/ml DiC8, or 100 nm Bryo for various times. PMA and Bryo were dissolved in ethanol, with a final vehicle concentration in the medium of <0.1%; DiC8 was dissolved in acetone, with a final vehicle concentration of <0.2%. Control cells were treated with the appropriate vehicle alone. Depletion of PKC α, δ, and ∈ from IEC-18 cells was accomplished by treatment with 1 μm PDBu or 100 nm PMA for 24 h, as we have described previously (26Frey M.R. Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Rollins A.

Selective down-regulation of PKC δ and ∈ was carried out by pulse treatment of IEC-18 cells with 10 or 100 nm PMA for 15 min, followed by two washes in warm PBS, and return to complete medium for 24 h.

Asynchronously growing IEC-18 cells were treated with vehicle (Control), 100 nm PMA, or 100 nm Bryo for 5 or 75 min. Cell lysates were prepared according to the Raf-1 Immunoprecipitation Kinase Cascade Assay kit protocol from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and Raf-1-induced phosphorylation of myelin basic protein was determined by scintillation counting. 5- and 75-min data are the average of four and two independent experiments, respectively. B, PKC α is sufficient to mediate PMA-induced activation of Raf-1. PKC δ/∈-depleted cells (α, Pulse), generated by pulse treatment with PMA as described under “Experimental Procedures” (see immunoblot), were treated with 100 nm PMA for 5 min, and cell lysates were examined for Raf-1 activity as described in A. C, PMA-induced activation of Raf-1 is PKC/PKC α-dependent. Asynchronously growing IEC-18 cells (i.e. control cells), PKC α, δ, and ∈-depleted cells, and PKC δ/∈-depleted (PKC α-expressing) cells were incubated with 100 nm PMA for 2 h. Raf-1 was detected in cell lysates by anti-Raf-1 immunoblotting. PMA treatment of cells expressing the full profile of PKC isozymes resulted in a change in the mobility of Raf-1 from a faster migrating form to a slower migrating form (arrow).

Silencing of PKC δ and PKC ∈ Using RNA Interference (RNAi) Technology—The target sequences for rat PKC δ and PKC ∈ were 5′-AAGATTATCGGCCGCTGCACT-3′ and 5′-AAGTGCGCTGGGCTAAAGAAA-3′, respectively (32Irie N. Sakai N. Ueyama T. Kajimoto T. Shirai Y. Saito N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). High pressure liquid chromatography-purified and annealed double-stranded short interfering RNA sequences with d(TT) overhangs at the 3′ end (siRNAs) were obtained from Qiagen, Inc. siRNAs were transfected into IEC-18 cells at 30% confluence using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. siRNA resuspension buffer was used in place of siRNA for control transfections. Forty two hours after transfection, cells were treated with 100 nm PMA or vehicle (EtOH) for 6 h and harvested for flow cytometric analysis. Selective silencing of the appropriate PKC isozyme was confirmed by subjecting parallel whole cell lysates to anti-PKC α, anti-PKC δ, and anti-PKC ∈ immunoblot analysis. Preparation of Whole Cell Lysates and Western Blot Analysis—For preparation of whole cell lysates, cells were solubilized in boiling SDS lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% SDS). Cellular DNA was sheared by passing the lysate through a 27-gauge needle, and extracts were cleared by centrifugation (10 min, 12,000 × g) and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar).

Cytosolic protein in the supernatant was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min on ice, pelleted, washed in acetone, solubilized in 100 mm NaOH, and neutralized by the addition of 100 mm HCl. Cellular membranes were extracted from the particulate pellet with 1% Triton X-100. The membrane sample was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. To obtain the cytoskeletal fraction, the Triton X-100-insoluble pellet was resuspended in digitonin lysis buffer containing 0.5% SDS and protease/phosphatase inhibitors, briefly probe-sonicated, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Soluble, membrane, and cytoskeletal fractions were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) for 5 min before being subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis.

Polysaccharide lyases (EC 4.2.2.-) are carbon-oxygen lyases that exploit β-elimination chemistry to cleave C5 uronic acid containing pyranoside substrates such as polygalacturonates, alginates, hyaluronan, and chondroitin. In contrast to the 90 sequence-derived families of glycoside hydrolases, polysaccharide lyases have been grouped into just 12 families (1Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Davies G. Henrissat B.

The parallel β-helix domain is superhelical and comprises three short β-strands, typically three to four residue, per coil of the superhelix; these coils stack coil-on-coil to form three parallel β-sheets that extend the whole length of the domain, and these β-sheets are referred to as PB1, PB2, and PB3. Schematic diagrams of the three parallel β-helix domains, including that of Pel9A reported in this report, are shown in Fig. 1. The turns between the short β-strands are known as T1, T2, and T3, and these turns connect PB1 to PB2, PB2 to PB3, and PB3 to PB1 of the next coil of the superhelix, respectively (see Fig. 2a).Fig. 2Distinct side chain stacks within the parallel β-helix domain of Pel9A.a, an all atom representation of coil 5 of the superhelical architecture of Pel9A formed by residues 211–234, with PB1, PB2, and PB3 labeled and viewed normal to the β-strands.

The three-dimensional structures of the solved glycoside hydrolases show more structural diversity, although the β/α barrel occurs frequently, often with catalytic carboxylates at the ends of β-strands 4 and 7 (8Jenkins J.

So far, only one glycoside hydrolase family has been shown to have parallel β-helix architecture, family GH-28 (10Petersen T.N. Kauppinen S. Larsen S. Structure. 1997; 5: 533-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), a family that includes the enzyme polygalacturonase (11Pickersgill R. Smith D. Worboys K. Jenkins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24660-24664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), although three other families have been predicted as parallel β-helices (12Rigden D.J. Franco O.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 530: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Carbohydrate esterases can be grouped into 13 sequence-based families, and the parallel β-helix fold occurs again in carbohydrate esterase family CE-8, a family of pectin methylesterases (13Jenkins J. Mayans O. Smith D. Worboys K. Pickersgill R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The parallel β-helix fold of each of these families has its distinct structural features (14Jenkins J. Pickersgill R. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 111-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Pectate lyases cleave polymeric α-1,4-linked galacturonic acids (GalA) of the pectate component of the plant cell wall by a β-elimination mechanism that generates a 4,5-unsaturated oligogalacturonate product. All pectate lyases, with the exception of PelW (15Shevchik V.E. Condemine G. Robert-Baudouy J. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3912-3919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), require calcium for in vitro activity and presumably utilize the abundant calcium in the plant cell wall for activity in vivo. The role of calcium has been controversial, but it is now clear that it binds to both enzymes and substrates and can mediate enzyme substrate interactions by binding between enzyme and substrate (16Scavetta R.D. Herron S.R. Hotchkiss A.T. Kita N. Keen N.T. Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Jurnak F. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Some pectate lyases have been shown to have a preference for partially methylated polymers of polygalacturonic acid, and the non-calcium-dependent pectin lyases that cleave fully methylated substrates also belong to family PL-1 (17Mayans O. Scott M. Connerton I. Gravesen T. Benen J. Visser J. Pickersgill R. Jenkins J. Structure. 1997; 5: 677-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Erwinia chrysanthemi is a pathogenic enterobacterium that causes soft-rot diseases in a variety of crops. The bacterium enters the plant through wounds and secretes polygalacturonate-active enzymes that break down the complex polysaccharide pectin. Pectin is a key component of the plant cell wall, and these enzymes enable the further invasion of the bacterium. E. chrysanthemi is known to produce six PL-1 (PelA, -B, -C, -D, -E, and -Z), a PL-2 (PelW), a PL-3 (PelI), and two PL-9 (PelL and PelX) pectate lyases. PelL is an endo-acting, calcium-dependent pectate lyase with relatively low activity against polygalacturonate (∼100-fold less than the major PL-1 pectate lyase PelB) and with a pH optimum around 8.0 (18Lojkowska E. Masclaux C. Boccara M. Robert-Baudouy J. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 19Roy C. Kester H. Visser J. Shevchik V. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Robert-Baudouy J. Benen J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3705-3709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report the 1.6-Å resolution crystal structure of the endo-acting pectate lyase L (EC 4.2.2.2) from E. chrysanthemi 3937 (called Pel9A throughout this article as it is a paradigm for the polysaccharide lyase family 9 enzymes). The fold of Pel9A was correctly predicted as part of the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction competition (20Murzin A.G. Bateman A. Proteins. 2001; : 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but the modelers had severe difficulties producing a molecular model for Pel9A because of the repetitive nature of the fold, the short β-strands, and the many possibilities for excursions between the β-strands. When the “primary” calcium-binding sites of the previously described Pel1A and the Pel9A structure described here are superimposed, the active site geometry is seen to be closely similar, but lysine in Pel9A replaces the catalytic arginine of the Pel1A enzymes. The K273A mutant of Pel9A is inactive but correctly folded, supporting the assignment of lysine 273 as the catalytic base. Production of Native Pectate Lyase L—The pectate lyase L gene from E. chrysanthemi (PelL) was overproduced in Escherichia coli BL21 cells and purified from the periplasm by ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography (21Shevchik V. Scott M. Mayans O. Jenkins J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The purified protein gave a single band on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels. The protein was concentrated to 20–30 mg/ml for crystallization, and the largest crystals grew from 16 to 17% 1,6-hexanediol, 12–13% polyethylene glycol 3350, 100 mm sodium chloride with 400 mm citrate, pH 5.6. The crystals grew as plates up to 1.0 mm long, 0.4 mm across, and 0.2 mm thick. The crystals are orthorhombic, space group P212121, with a = 55.33 Å, b = 57.83 Å, c = 114.93 Å, and with a single molecule in the asymmetric unit. Preparation of Heavy Atom Derivatives and Data Collection—Data were collected from crystals cooled to 100 K in the nitrogen gas stream of an Oxford Cryosystems cryocooler using synchrotron radiation and image plate or CCD detector (Table I). No additional cryoprotectant was needed for successful flash cooling for native or heavy atom soaked crystals. Heavy atom derivatives were prepared by soaking Pel9A crystals in the heavy atoms dissolved in 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, 20% hexane 2,5-diol, 400 mm sodium acetate with 100 mm sodium chloride. Heavy atom data were collected from crystals soaked in platinum orange (chloro(2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine) platinum(II) chloride), chloroplatinate (long and short soaks), lead acetate, and sodium hexachloroiridite. The concentrations and soak times used are given in Table I as is a summary of the crystallographic statistics. Data were reduced using DENZO and SCALEPACK (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The correct hand of the solution was that which gave the greatest peak heights on cross-phased difference Fourier maps. The heavy atom positions from the difference Patterson and the difference Fourier maps were refined using MLPHARE (24Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar), and protein phases were calculated to a 2.3-Å resolution. DM (26Otwinowski Z.

SERC, Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1991: 80-86Google Scholar) was then used to improve the protein phases, and the difference Fourier maps were recalculated, reviewed, and re-refined. DM was then run at 1.6 Å to give protein phases that were used in WARP (27Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). WARP successfully built 85% of the protein model. Refinement was completed using CNS and REFMAC (28Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) combined with model building using O (29Jones T.A. Zou J-T Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). PROCHECK was used to judge the stereochemical quality of the final structure (30Laskowski R.A. MacAuthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Sequence alignments used T-Coffee (31Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5514) Google Scholar). Crystallographic statistics are given in Table I. The presence of a calcium ion at the active site was confirmed by inspection of an anomalous difference map. Construction and Analysis of Mutant Proteins—The single mutations K273A and K273R were introduced in PelL (Pel9A) by site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The primers K273A (5′-ggcaacgggttcGCCctaggaggaaacc-3′) and K273A-rc, the reverse complementary to K273A, were used to create K273A, and the primers K273R (5′-ggcaacgggttcCGCctaggaggaaacc-3′) and K273R-rc, the reverse complementary to K273R, were used to generate K273R (codon 273 is in uppercase letters). The two amino acid substitutions led to the creation of a unique AvrII restriction site. After the nucleotide sequences were verified, the stability and enzymatic activity of mutant proteins were tested. The plasmid pT7L1.6 carrying the pelL gene under control of the Φ10 promoter and the derivative plasmids bearing the mutant pelL genes were introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells, and the pectate lyase was overproduced and extracted from the cells as described previously (21Shevchik V. Scott M. Mayans O. Jenkins J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The quantity of mutant proteins in whole cell lysates and periplasmic extracts was compared with that of wild type PelL by immunoblotting with PelL antibodies. The pectate lyase activity in periplasmic extracts was measured spectrophotometrically at 230 nm. The quantities of K273A,K273R mutant proteins produced were comparable with wild type PelL, indicating that these mutations do not affect the protein production and stability, but the mutants were inactive, supporting the assignment of lysine 273 as an important catalytic residue. The Architecture of Pel9A—The three-dimensional structure of Pel9A from E. chrysanthemi was solved at a resolution of 1.6 Å (see “Materials and Methods” and Tables I and II). The mature polypeptide chain (residues 26–425) of Pel9A folds to form a right-handed parallel β-helix (residues 95–356) with distinct structural features and with 10 turns of superhelical architecture (Fig. 1). The parallel β-helix domains of Pel1A and Pel3A are shorter than Pel9A with only eight complete superhelical turns but, like polygalacturonase, Pel9A has 10 turns (Fig. 1). When compared with Pel1A, Pel9A has considerably shorter and better-ordered loops. All three enzymes shown in Fig. 1 have an N-terminal α-helix that caps the hydrophobic core of the parallel β-helix.Table IIThe quality of the pectate lyase L structureComposition of the modelNumber of protein atoms3026Number of water molecules524Additional ions1 calcium, 1 sodiumData used in refinementResolution limits (Å)57.47-1.60Number of reflections used46458Overall B-factor (Å2)8.10R-factoraR-factor and Rfree are given by Σ |Fobs - Fcalc|/Σ Fobs, where Fobs and Fcalc represent, respectively, the observed and calculated structure factors.

The N-terminal extension forms the first strand of PB2 (residues 40–44) and an extravagant but well ordered loop (residues 47–62) before forming the α-helix (residues 62–70) that contributes Phe-63 and Met-67 to the capping of the hydrophobic core at the N-terminal end of the β-helix. There then follow 10 turns of superhelical architecture, starting with the second strand of PB2 (residues 74–77). At the end of the β-helix domain, the polypeptide breaks away abruptly from the final β-strand of PB3 to form the C-terminal extension (residues 357–425) that comprises an extended irregular hairpin that packs against PB3 and further irregular structure, part of which is stabilized by a sodium ion in the crystal structure. Trp-357 of the C-terminal extension terminates the aromatic stack on PB1 (see below) and plugs the hydrophobic core at the C-terminal end of the β-helix. In comparison with the other right-handed β-helix structures solved, Pel9A has a very regular arrangement of side chains and main chain in the T3 turns (between PB3 of coil n and PB1 of coil n + 1). This regularity is conferred by the remarkably well ordered like-on-like stacks in this region, which includes an eight-residue glycine stack, a six-residue asparagine ladder at T3 (asparagines 174, 198, 231, 255, 293, and 317), and a four-residue alanine stack (alanines 195, 228, 252, and 290) (Fig. 2, a and b). In Pel9A, there are also additional short asparagine ladders within the T2 turn (Asn-312, Asn-338, and Asn-355) and within the T1 turn (Asn-164, Asn-188, and Asn-221). The regularity in the T3 region extends to the main chain conformation that forms hydrogen bonds up and down the length of the parallel β-helix. It is the T2 turn and PB3 that possess the asparagine ladder and the aromatic stack characteristic of the Pel1A enzymes (Fig. 2, c and d). The regular aromatic stack of Pel1A (Fig. 2d) is replaced by the alanine stack described above in Pel9A, and for many turns, the less regular aromatic stack on PB1 fills the parallel β-helix (phenylalanines 211, 236, 272, and 298 and tyrosine 321; Fig. 2b). Although an aromatic residue is shown on PB2 of Pel9A (Fig. 2a), this is not involved in extensive stacks. There is also an external aromatic stack on the surface of PB2 in Pel9A involving His-172, Tyr-196, Trp-229, Phe-253, Phe-291, and Tyr-315. The distinctive features of Pel9A, the aromatic stack on PB1, and the asparagine ladder within the T3 turn are interesting and show how different sequences can pack the core of the β-helix domain. The success of the parallel β-helix in polygalacturonate-active enzymes is presumably because the binding surface on the external surface of PB1 and adjacent loops is well suited to binding polygalacturonates. Calcium Binding to Pel9A and Pel1A Enzymes—A single calcium ion is seen bound to Pel9A (Fig. 3a) despite no addition of calcium during purification and crystallization, which implies that the site has at least μm affinity and that the enzyme has scavenged the calcium present in trace quantities from the solutions. The calcium-binding site is formed by four aspartates on the external surface of PB1. This calcium-binding site is strikingly similar both in its position on the surface of PB1 and in the nature of the calcium ligands to the first calcium site identified both in the Pel1A structures (4Pickersgill R. Jenkins J. Harris G. Nasser W. Robert-Baudouy J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 717-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 32Herron S.R. Scarvetta R.D. Garrett M. Legner M. Jurnak F. J. Biol.

Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1786-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Superimposition of the calcium ion of Pel9A with the equivalent calcium in the PelC substrate complex reveals that Asp-131, Glu-166, and Asp-170 of PelC are equivalent to Asp-209, Asp-233, and Asp-237, respectively, of Pel9A. These superimposed carboxylates correspond to the three calcium-binding aspartates seen in Bacillus subtilis pectate lyase (BsPel). If the common calcium-binding residues are superimposed, then the β-helices are brought into close structural alignment, revealing that, when compared with the Pel1A enzymes, the two additional coils of Pel9A are N-terminal to the calcium-binding site such that in Pel9A, the calcium-binding aspartates are on coils 5 and 6, whereas in PelC, they are on coils 3 and 4 (Fig. 3). PelC and Pel9A superimpose with a root mean square deviation of 1.8 Å for 171 equivalent α-carbon atoms. Data collected from native Pel9A crystals soaked in substrates and calcium did not reveal bound ligand or additional calcium-binding sites (data not shown), but the Pb sites used to calculate the protein phases do indicate the presence of a second calcium-binding site close to the active center. In the PelC “Michaelis” complex formed using the inactive mutant R218K and Ca2+/GalA4 (32Herron S.R. Scarvetta R.D. Garrett M. Legner M. Jurnak F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12271-12277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), substrate occupies the -1 to +3 subsites, and the mutated Arg-218 is the base and abstracts the C5 proton from the galacturonic residue at the +1 subsite (Fig. 3). The first calcium binds the carboxylate oxygen of the galacturonic residue at the -1 subsite. A second calcium is bound by Glu-166 (OE1 and OE2), by the ring oxygen (O5) and one carboxylate oxygen of the galacturonic residue at subsite +1, and by a second carboxylate oxygen from the galacturonic residue at subsite -1. A third calcium binds the second carboxylate oxygen of the galacturonic residue at the +1 subsite and the ring oxygen of the residue at the +2 subsite. The fourth and fifth calcium are close to the putative base and bind the ring and carboxylate oxygens of the galacturonic residue at the +3 subsite. Clearly, the first calcium site is conserved between the Pel1A and Pel9A enzymes, and the aspartate contributing to the second site is conserved (Fig. 3), suggesting that in the Pel9A substrate complex, a second calcium would bridge between Asp-233 and substrate carboxylates at the +1 and -1 subsites. This suggestion is supported by the binding of Pb to Pel9A; one Pb-binding site is close to the position at which calcium binds to Pel9A, and a second Pb binds in the position anticipated for the second calcium in the Pel9A-substrate complex (Fig. 3d). The aspartates contributing to the third and fourth calcium-binding sites in PelC are not present in Pel9A. However, Asp-299 in Pel9A may form a calcium-binding site together with substrate carboxylates, and this calcium would be in a similar position to the fourth calcium in PelC. There are no arginines in the substrate-binding cleft of Pel9A, and so substrate carboxylate interactions with arginines involving both carboxylate oxygens and hydrogens of NH1 and NH2 nitrogens of the arginine, as seen for the galacturonic residue at subsite +2 and Arg-245 in PelC, cannot occur in Pel9A. However, when compared with PelC, Pel9A has two additional carboxylates, Asp-299 and Glu-180, in t"
https://openalex.org/W2092383640,"Human P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transports a wide variety of structurally diverse compounds out of the cell. Knowledge about the packing of the transmembrane (TM) segments is essential for understanding the mechanism of drug recognition and transport. We used cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and disulfide cross-linking analysis to determine which TM segment in the COOH half of P-gp was close to TMs 5 and 6 since these segments in the NH2 half are important for drug binding. An active Cys-less P-gp mutant cDNA was used to generate 240 double cysteine mutants that contained 1 cysteine in TMs 5 or 6 and another in TMs 7 or 8. The mutants were subjected to oxidative cross-linking analysis. No disulfide cross-linking was observed in the 140 TM6/TM7 or TM6/TM8 mutants. By contrast, cross-linking was detected in several P-gp TM5/TM8 mutants. At 4 °C, when thermal motion is low, P-gp mutants N296C(TM5)/G774C(TM8), I299C(TM5)/F770C(TM8), I299C(TM5)/G774C(TM8), and G300C(TM5)/F770C(TM8) showed extensive cross-linking with oxidant. These mutants retained drug-stimulated ATPase activity, but their activities were inhibited after treatment with oxidant. Similarly, disulfide cross-linking was inhibited by vanadate trapping of nucleotide. These results indicate that significant conformational changes must occur between TMs 5 and 8 during ATP hydrolysis. We revised the rotational symmetry model for TM packing based on our results and by comparison to the crystal structure of MsbA (Chang, G. (2003) J. Mol. Biol. 330, 419–430) such that TM5 is adjacent to TM8, TM2 is adjacent to TM11, and TMs 1 and 7 are next to TMs 6 and 12, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2057492322,"Histidine decarboxylase (HDC) is the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of histidine to histamine, a bioamine that plays an important role in allergic responses, inflammation, neurotransmission, and gastric acid secretion. Previously, we demonstrated that gastrin activates HDC promoter activity in a gastric cancer (AGS-E) cell line through three overlapping downstream promoter elements. In the current study, we used the yeast one-hybrid strategy to identify nuclear factors that bind to these three elements. Among eight positives from the one-hybrid screen, we identified Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) (previously known as gut-enriched Kruppel-like factor (GKLF)) as one factor that binds to the gastrin responsive elements in the HDC promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that KLF4 is able to bind all three gastrin responsive elements. In addition, transient cotransfection experiments showed that overexpression of KLF4 dose dependently and specifically inhibited HDC promoter activity. Regulation of HDC transcription by KLF4 was confirmed by changes in the endogenous HDC messenger RNA by KLF4 small interfering RNA and KLF4 overexpression. We further showed that KLF4 inhibits HDC promoter activity by competing with Sp1 at the upstream GC box and also independently by binding the three downstream gastrin responsive elements. Taken together, these results indicate that KLF4 can act to repress HDC gene expression by Sp1-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

HDC is expressed in many different cell types, including mast cells, skin cells, platelets, and basophils. However, in the adult mammals, HDC is highly expressed in enterochromaffin-like cells, where the HDC activity is tightly regulated by a gut peptide hormone, gastrin (5Hocker M. Zhang Z. Koh T.J. Wang T.C. Yale J. Biol. Med. 1996; 69: 21-33PubMed Google Scholar). HDC regulation occurs at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels, the latter by proteolytic processing through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (6Fleming J.V. Wang T.C. J. Biol.

Whereas not all of the cis-acting DNA elements or the transcriptional factors involved in regulation of HDC transcription have been identified, three GC-rich gastrin responsive elements located downstream of the transcription initiation site have been characterized in the human HDC promoter region (16Raychowdhury R.

Recently, a neural peptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide has been reported to regulate HDC promoter activity in PC12 cells, and the responsive element of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide has been further mapped to the –177 to –170 region of the HDC promoter. Moreover, by using different protein kinase inhibitors, it has been shown that the mechanism of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide regulation is distinct from gastrin regulation of the HDC promoter (18McLaughlin J.T. Ai W. Sinclair N.F. Colucci R. Raychowdhury R. Koh T.J. Wang T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 268: G51-G59Google Scholar). Interestingly, the DNA methylation state of the HDC promoter region has been also shown to control HDC gene expression in both the human and mouse (19Suzuki-Ishigaki S. Numayama-Tsuruta K.

The HDC promoter region was demethylated in the HDC-expressing cell lines, such as the differentiated mast cell line MC9 and the erythroleukemia cell line DS19. In low HDC expression cells lines, such as P815, the HDC promoter was also demethylated after induction through incubation of P815 cells in the peritoneal cavity of BDF1 mice, and forced demethylation treatment induced high expression of HDC mRNA in P815 cells (19Suzuki-Ishigaki S. Numayama-Tsuruta K. Kuramasu A. Sakurai E. Makabe Y. Shimura S. Shirato K. Igarashi K. Watanabe T. Ohtsu H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2627-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although mutation of the Sp1-binding GC box in the human HDC promoter appear to disrupt the promoter activity, Sp1 binding to this GC box element does not appear to be influenced by DNA methylation at this site (20Kuramasu A. Saito H. Suzuki S. Watanabe T. Ohtsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31607-31614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Gastrin has also been shown to up-regulate gene expression through GC-rich DNA cis-elements in the promoter. For example, gastrin-induced activation of the chromogranin A promoter was mediated by a Sp1/Egr1 binding site (21Hocker M. Raychowdhury R. Plath T. Wu H. O'Connor D.T. Wiedenmann B. Rosewicz S. Wang T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34000-34007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, gastrin has been shown to up-regulate the vesicular monoamine transporter-2 promoter through a AP-2/Sp-1 binding site (22Gerhard M. Neumayer N. Presecan-Siedel E. Zanner R. Lengyel E. Cramer T. Hocker M. Prinz C. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3663-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Three gastrin responsive elements in the HDC promoter are also GC-rich, and bind novel, yet undefined transcription factors. Whereas most of these gastrin responsive elements are GC-rich, they do not share significant homology with each other. In terms of transcription factors that bind to GC boxes, Sp1 was the first mammalian transcriptional factor to be cloned (23Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar), and it binds to GC boxes (24Gidoni D. Kadonaga J.T. Barrera-Saldana H. Takahashi K. Chambon P. Tjian R. Science. 1985; 230: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), CACCC boxes (also called GT boxes) (25Giglioni B. Comi P. Ronchi A. Mantovani R. Ottolenghi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3663-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Sp1 belongs to the “zinc finger” family of transcriptional factors containing at least 20 identified members in mammals (27Black A.R. Black J.D. Azizkhan-Clifford J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar), including the Sp1 proteins, Sp1–Sp6, Kruppel-like factors (KLF1–KLF13), and KKLF. They share high homology with each other at their C-terminal with three zinc fingers that are similar to those found in the Drosophila protein, Kruppel. Because all Sp1/KLF factors appear to bind with varying affinities to GC-rich sequences, all family members have the potential to affect “Sp1 site-dependent” transcription. Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), previously known as gut-enriched Kruppel-like factor, is a recently cloned transcriptional factor in the mouse (28Garrett-Sinha L.A. Eberspaecher H.

Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2101-2105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and a requirement for KLF4 in the terminal differentiation of goblet cells in the colon (42Katz J.P. Perreault N. Goldstein B.G. Lee C.S. Labosky P.A. Yang V.W. Kaestner K.H. Development. 2002; 129: 2619-2628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, preliminary studies using a conditional gastric epithelium KLF4 knock-out mouse model suggest that KLF4 is required for normal gastric epithelial proliferation and differentiation (43Katz J.P. Perreault N. Glodstein B.G. Kaestner K.H. Abstracts of Digestive Disease Week 2003, Orlando, FL.2003: A-147Google Scholar). In this study, we used yeast one-hybrid screening to identify KLF4 as one of the gastrin responsive element binding factors. In addition, we also demonstrated that overexpression of KLF4 dose-dependently and specifically inhibits HDC promoter activity, and the KLF4 inhibition on the promoter is through both upstream Sp1 binding GC box and downstream gastrin responsive elements. Yeast One-hybrid Screening—Yeast one-hybrid screen was performed according to the manufacturer’s instruction (MATCHMAKER One-Hybrid System; Clontech). Briefly, two tandem copies of the full-length gastrin responsive element (+1 to +48) (designated as gastrin responsive elements (GAS-RE) (full)) (Fig. 1A) with EcoRI and XbaI sites at the ends were cloned upstream of the HIS3 reporter plasmid pHISi-1 digested with EcoRI and XbaI. The reporter plasmid was then further integrated into yeast strain YM4271 to generate the GAS-RE (full) reporter strain. Background growth of this reporter strain was ablated by titrating with 30 mm 3-aminotrizole (3-AT) (Sigma). Screening was carried out by transforming human lung cDNA library from Clontech (catalog number HL4044AH) into the GAS-RE (full)-pHISi-1 reporter strain. Plasmids were retrieved from the yeast colonies growing in His-Leu-agar plates with 30 mm 3-AT (44Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar). Plasmids from these clones were then transformed into DH5α bacterial competent cells (Invitrogen). The cDNA inserts were sequenced and then blasted with GenBank™ data base. To confirm yeast one-hybrid screening results, three tandem copies of each three gastrin responsive element were separately cloned into the reporter plasmid pHISi-1 to generate reporter yeast strains using the same strategy as described above. Positive plasmids from the first round screening were transformed back into GAS-RE (full) and GAS-RE1 (+1 to +19), GAS-RE2 (+11 to +27), and GAS-RE3 (+28 to +48) (Fig. 1A) reporter strains using LiOAc strategy (45Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). The yeast colonies from each transformation were then patched onto His-Leu-agar plates with different amounts of 3-AT. The growth of patched yeast colonies were compared after 2 to 4 days incubation in a 30 °C incubator. Nuclear Extract Preparation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Nuclear extract from AGS-E cells was prepared by the method of Dignam et al. (46Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar), as modified by Lee et al. (47Lee K.A. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Double stranded oligos of GAS-REs as shown in Fig. 1A and HDC-Sp1 oligos (see text) were radiolabeled using Klenow enzyme and [α-32P]dCTP. The respective double stranded DNA was generated by annealing one full strand with another strand that has 5′ overhangs without dCTP. Briefly, 5–10 μg of nuclear extract from AGS-E cells were mixed with 1.0 μg of poly(dA-dT) (for GAS-RE probes) or poly(dI-dC) (for Sp1 binding GC box) (Amersham Biosciences) and different amounts of unlabeled oligos or 1-μl antibodies in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol (48Ai W. Toussaint E. Roman A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4220-4229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions were incubated on ice for 15 min prior to the addition of 20,000–100,000 cpm of [α-32P]dCTP-labeled oligos. Mixtures were further incubated on ice for 10 min before loading onto a 0.5× TBE, 5% nondenatured polyacrylamide gel, and then electrophoresis was carried out at 250 V for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The gel was then dried and exposed to a Fuji phosphorimaging screen overnight, and the screen was scanned using a phosphorimager (Fuji FLA-5000). Construction of Plasmids—The minimal HDC promoter-driven luciferase reporter constructs with and without mutations were made by ligating different HDC promoter inserts with KpnI and HindIII restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends with pGL2 firefly luciferase vector (pGL2-basic) (Promega) pre-digested with the same enzymes. Different HDC promoter inserts were generated by annealing sense strand (5′ partial) with the respective antisense strands (5′ partial) as listed in Table I (the respective mutations were also underlined). Both strands have complimentary 20–30-bp overlap in the middle region. The annealed oligos were then Klenow filled-in to generate full-length double-stranded fragments. They were further used as the template for PCR to clone the promoters into pGL2 vector as described above, using the primers with KpnI and HindIII restriction enzyme sites at the 5′ end as listed in Table I. The final reporter constructs were all confirmed by sequencing.Table IOligonucleotides used for HDC minimal promoter cloningNameSequence (5′ to 3′)Wild type (top)GGAATTAATTAAACCTGGAGGAAGGGACTTTGAAGGGCGGAGCTAAGGTCAAAGAAAGAACCCTTTSp1M (top)GGAATTAATTAAACCTGGAGGAAGGGACTTTGAAGTTCGGAGCTAAGGTCAAAGAAAGAACCCTTTSp1M-GAS-RE1M (top)GGAATTAATTAAACCTGGAGGAAGGGACTTTGAAGTTCGGAGCTAAGGTCAAAGAAAGAAAAGAATGAS-RE1M (top)GGAATTAATTAAACCTGGAGGAAGGGACTTTGAAGGGCGGAGCTAAGGTCAAAGAAAGAAAAGAATWild type (bottom)GTCCTGCGCACTCCCTGGCAGCCAGTGTGGGCCCTTTATTTAAAGGGTTCTTTCTTTGACCTTAGCGAS-RE1M (bottom)GTCCTGCGCACTCCCTGGCAGCCAGTGTGGGCCCTTTATTTATTCTTTTCTTTCTTTGACCTTAGCGAS-RE2M (bottom)GTCCTGCGCACTCCCTGGCAGCCAGTGTGATTGCTTTATTTAAAGGGTTCTTTCTTTGACCTTAGCGAS-RE3M (bottom)GTCCTGCGCATTAACTGGCAGCCAGTGTGGGCCCTTTATTTAAAGGGTTCTTTCTTTGACCTTAGCGAS-RE12M (bottom)GTCCTGCGCACTCCCTGGCAGCCAGTGTGATTGCTTTATTTATTCTTTTCTTTCTTTGACCTTAGCGAS-RE13M (bottom)GTCCTGCGCATTAACTGGCAGCCAGTGTGGGCCCTTTATTTATTCTTTTCTTTCTTTGACCTTAGCGAS-RE23M (bottom)GTCCTGCGCATTAACTGGCAGCCAGTGTGATTGCTTTATTTAAAGGGTTCTTTCTTTGACCTTAGCGAS-RE123M (bottom)GTCCTGCGCATTAACTGGCAGCCAGTGTGATTGCTTTATTTATTCTTTTCTTTCTTTGACCTTAGCHDC5 (for PCR)CCCGGTACCGGAATTAATTAAACC (5′ KpnI site)HDC3 (for PCR)CCCAAGCTTGTCCTGCGCACTC (5′ HindIII site)HDC3 (GAS-RE3M) (for PCR)CCCAAGCTTGTCCTGCGCATTAAC (5′ HindIII site) Open table in a new tab The human KLF4, KLF4(ZF), KLF5, and KLF5(ZF) expression plasmids were cloned as follows. First, total RNA was extracted from exponentially growing AGS-E cells as mentioned below. The reverse transcription reaction was performed to generate the first strand cDNA. The cDNA was used as template to perform PCR using the following primer pairs: KLF4-5 (5′-CCCGGATCCATGGCTGTCAGCGACGCGCTG-3′) and KLF4-3 (5′-CCCGAATTCTTAAAATGCCTCTTCATGTGTAAG-3′) for KLF4, KLF4-5(ZF) (5′-CCCGGATCCACTTGTGATTACGCGGGCTGC-3′) and KLF4-3 for KLF4(ZF), KLF5-5 (5′-CCCGGATCCATGGCTACAAGGGTGCTGAGC-3′), and KLF5-3 (5′-CCCGAATTCTCGTTCTGGTGCCTCTTCATATG-3′) for KLF5, and KLF5-5(ZF) (5′-CCCGGATCCTACTGCGATTACCCTGGTTGC-3′) and KLF5-3 for KLF5(ZF). The PCR production was digested with EcoRI and BamHI. The respective inserts were then cloned into pcDNA3.1/Myc-HisB (Invitrogen, catalogue number V800-20) precut with EcoRI and BamHI. The constructs were all confirmed by sequencing. Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—AGS-E cells and HEK293 cells were grown in complete medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2). AGS-E cells were generated by stable transfection of AGS cells (ATCC CRL 1739) with the CCKB receptor. Transient transfections were performed using Superfect® (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. AGS-E cells were seeded to ∼60% confluence in 12-well plates. Each well was transfected with 0.005 μg of thymidine kinase promoter-driven Renilla luciferase expression plasmid as an internal control, 0.5 μg of different HDC reporter constructs, and 0.5 μg of either the different expression plasmids or the empty vector. Three hours after transfection, media was replaced with Ultraculture®. Cells were stimulated the following day with gastrin (10–7m) for a 24-h period. If gastrin treatment is not needed, the cells were cultured in regular medium after transfection. Total RNA from AGS-E Cells and Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—AGS-E cells were grown to 70% confluence in either a 6-well (for reverse transcriptase-PCR) or a 10-cm tissue culture dish (for cloning of KLF4 and KLF5 constructs). Cells were then transfected with specific KLF4 siRNA ordered from Qiagen-Xeragon or KLF4 expression plasmids (pcDNA3-KLF4 and the vector alone) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). KLF4-specific siRNA sequence corresponds with the following DNA sequence (5′ to 3′): AACCTGGCGCCCCTACCTCGG. Forty-eight hours later, RNA was isolated using Trizol® reagent (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. After extraction, 5 μg of total RNA was then used as a template to synthesize the complimentary cDNA using the First Strand Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). The cDNA from this synthesis was then used in regular reverse transcript PCR and quantitative real-time PCR (quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR) analysis using the following primer pairs of human origin: HDC5 (5′-AAGATCATCAAGCCGCCTCAGC-3′) and HDC3 (5′-AGCGCACCGTCTTCTTCTTAGT-3′) for the HDC gene, KLF4-5RT (5′-CAAGTCCCGCCGCTCCATTACCAA-3′) and KLF4-3RT (5′-CCACAGCCGTCCCAGTCACAGTGG-3′) for the KLF4 gene, and GAPDH-5RT (5′-GACATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAGC-3′) and GAPDH-3RT (5′-GTCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAG-3′) for the GAPDH gene. RNase Protection Assay—About 260 bp of the 3′ portion of β-actin cDNA and about 530 bp of the 3′ portion of human HDC cDNA were used as the template to label the probes. [32P]CTP-labeled probes were incubated with 20 μg of total RNA for β-actin and 60 μg for HDC and then subjected to RNase digestion using a kit from Ambion (catalog numbers 1312 and 1415). Following electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide denaturing gel with 8 m urea, the gel was then dried and exposed to a Fuji phosphorimaging screen overnight, and the screen was scanned using a phosphor imager (Fuji FLA-5000). Three separate RNase protection assays were performed with similar results. Luciferase Assays of HDC Reporter Constructs—After incubation with or without gastrin, cells were washed with PBS and frozen at –80 °C for at least 30 min to increase the efficiency of cell lysis. Cells were then transferred to room temperature and incubated with 250 μl of 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega) for 20 min with constant shaking. Fifty microliters of the cell lysate was then assayed in a Monolight luminometer, Monolight™3010 (BD Pharmingen). Light units of each reporter were divided by those of the internal control Renilla luciferase to represent the relative promoter activity. Western Blotting Analysis—KLF4-pcDNA3.1/Myc-HisB overexpression construct and the vector control were transfected into HEK293 cells similarly as described above. 48 h later after transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed with lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, plus proteinase mixture (Roche Diagnostics, catalog number 10130500). The cells were sonicated briefly, and the supernatant was collected by centrifugation. About 100 μg of total protein was separated on 4–20% SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Western blotting analysis was then performed using anti-myc horseradish peroxidase antibody (1:5000, Invitrogen, catalog number 460709) and anti-α-tubulin antibody (1:1000, Oncogene, catalog number CP06-100UG) followed by a standard enhanced chemiluminiscence (ECL) detection procedure. Yeast One-hybrid Screening to Identify GAS-RE Binding Factors—To identify the nuclear factors that bind the gastrin responsive elements in the HDC promoter, a human lung cDNA library was screened using two tandem copies of full-length GAS-RE (full) as the bait that spans from +1 to +48 in the promoter (Fig. 1A). After two positive clones from the first round of screening were pulled out, they were further confirmed by using the individual gastrin responsive elements GAS-RE1, GAS-RE2, and GAS-RE3 reporter strains (respective reporter constructs are shown in Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1C, only transfection of the plasmid extracted from clone 2 (but not from clone 1) into each reporter strain showed cell growth on the 30 mm 3-AT containing plate, whereas on plates lacking 3-AT, they showed similar growth, indicating that protein expressed from clone 2 can bind all three gastrin responsive elements (and clone 1 is not a true positive). After sequencing, the plasmid extracted from clone 2 was found to contain the in-frame 3′ sequence of the human KLF4 cDNA. From the yeast one-hybrid screening, in addition to KLF4 we found seven other plasmids (containing partial in-frame sequence of Baf60a, Mif1, eIF4B, eIF6, PRED56, KLF2(LKLF), and DC24) transactivated by reporter gene expression. We decided to concentrate our studies in this report on KLF4, because this zinc finger containing transcriptional factor is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, and inhibits ODC promoter activity (32Chen Z.Y.

https://openalex.org/W1970054731,"Toxoplasma gondii parasites gain entry into host cells through a process that depends on apically stored adhesins that are strategically released during invasion. One of these adhesins, microneme protein 2 (MIC2), is a type one transmembrane protein that binds to an accessory protein known as MIC2-associated protein (M2AP). Together the MIC2·M2AP complex participates in host cell attachment and invasion. The short cytoplasmic C-domain of MIC2 is implicated in protein trafficking and mediating an association with the parasite cytoskeleton. To define the role of the cytoplasmic domain of MIC2, proteins lacking the C-domain were expressed in transgenic T. gondii. Surprisingly, protein trafficking and secretion were not affected. We hypothesized that mutant mic2 lacking the C-domain might be escorted to the micronemes by association with endogenous wild-type MIC2 possessing functional transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. To investigate this interaction, native blue gels and gel filtration were employed to identify a stable macromolecular MIC2·M2AP complex of ∼450 kDa. Our findings reveal that MIC2 and M2AP proteins form stable hexamers consisting of three αβ dimers. Resolution of this complex has implications for how MIC2·M2AP associates with host cell receptors and the cytoskeleton to facilitate parasite motility and invasion.

Resolution of this complex has implications for how MIC2·M2AP associates with host cell receptors and the cytoskeleton to facilitate parasite motility and invasion. Apicomplexan parasites actively gain entry into host cells by a unique mechanism that depends on the cohesive interaction of cytoskeletal proteins and surface adhesins (1Morrissette N.S. Sibley L.D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 21-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Host cell invasion is fundamental to diseases caused by this phylum of pathogenic organisms that includes Plasmodium falciparum, the etiological agent of severe malaria and Toxoplasma gondii, the causative agent of toxoplasmosis. Tachyzoites (Toxoplasma) and sporozoites (Plasmodium) employ similar adhesins for active entry into host cells. These adhesins define a family of thrombospondin-related anonymous proteins (TRAPs) 1The abbreviations used are: TRAP, thrombospondin-related anonymous protein; C-domain, C-terminal cytoplasmic domain; MIC, micronemal proteins; MIC2, micronemal protein 2; M2AP, MIC2-associated protein; mutΔC, deletion mutant lacking the C-domain of MIC2; NBG, native blue gels; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; HA, hemagglutinin; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; rcf, relative centrifical force.1The abbreviations used are: TRAP, thrombospondin-related anonymous protein; C-domain, C-terminal cytoplasmic domain; MIC, micronemal proteins; MIC2, micronemal protein 2; M2AP, MIC2-associated protein; mutΔC, deletion mutant lacking the C-domain of MIC2; NBG, native blue gels; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; HA, hemagglutinin; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; rcf, relative centrifical force.

Sibley L.D. Ajioka J.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). TRAP family members are type 1 transmembrane proteins that are comprised of adhesive N-terminal domains that harbor integrin-like A-domains and at least one thrombospondin like domain and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (C-domain) (2Robson K.J.H.

Ajioka J.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Toxoplasma gondii contains a single TRAP family member called MIC2, which is expressed by all of the invasive stages of the parasite. MIC2 is stored in the apically located microneme secretory organelles. Following host cell contact, microneme vesicles fuse with the proximal plasma membrane depositing MIC2 on the surface of the parasite (4Carruthers V.B. Moreno S.N.J. Sibley L.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 5Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 114-123PubMed Google Scholar, 6Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Images of T. gondii captured at various stages of invasion indicate that MIC2 is translocated to the posterior end of the parasite during the rapid process of entry (7Carruthers V.B. Giddings O.K. Sibley L.D. Cell Microbiol. 1999; 1: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Ultimately, MIC2 is removed from the parasite surface by a protease that cleaves the MIC2 protein within the transmembrane domain (8Carruthers V.B. Sherman G.D. Sibley L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14346-14353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 9Opitz C. Di Cristina M. Reiss M. Ruppert T. Crisanti A. Soldati D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1577-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Amino acids within and just external to the transmembrane domain are implicated in this processing event (9Opitz C. Di Cristina M. Reiss M. Ruppert T. Crisanti A. Soldati D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1577-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 10Brossier F. Jewett T.J. Lovett J.L. Sibley L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6229-6234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recently, a Drosophila rhomboid protease was found to cleave a chimeric substrate containing the MIC2 transmembrane domain suggesting that a parasite-derived rhomboid might serve this function in vivo (11Urban S. Freeman M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1425-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). A second micronemal protein, M2AP, is known to facilitate the transport of MIC2 through the secretory network (12Huynh M.H. Barenau K.E. Harper J.M. Beatty W.L. Sibley L.D. Carruthers V.B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2082-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 13Rabenau K.E. Sohrabi A. Tripathy A. Reitter C. Ajioka J.W. Tomley F.M. Carruthers V.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Mutant parasites that do not express M2AP (Δm2ap) have a defect in parasite invasion presumably the consequence of insufficient transport of MIC2 to the micronemes (12Huynh M.H. Barenau K.E. Harper J.M. Beatty W.L. Sibley L.D. Carruthers V.B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2082-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The type 1 transmembrane topology of the MIC2 protein predicts that the short C-domain is exposed to the parasite cytoplasm (i) during trafficking through the secretory network, (ii) on the surface of microneme membranes in resting parasites, and (iii) along the parasite plasma membrane during host cell invasion. Two short amino acid sequences within the cytoplasmic domain of MIC2 have been shown to be sufficient to target a chimeric construct of the surface antigen SAG1 to the micronemes (14Di Cristina M. Spaccapelo R. Soldati D. Bistoni F. Crisanti A. Molec. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 7332-7341Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a penultimate tryptophan within TRAP family members is required for efficient association with the parasites actin cytoskeleton (15Jewett T.J. Sibley L.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 885-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Plasmodium sporozoites expressing TRAP proteins lacking the cytoplasmic domain or tryptophan residue exhibit deficient motility and are unable to invade host cells (16Kappe S. Bruderer T. Gantt S. Fujioka H. Nussenzweig V. Ménard R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Recently biochemical evidence for an indirect association with the cytoskeleton via the actin binding protein aldolase has been demonstrated in Toxoplasma (15Jewett T.J. Sibley L.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 885-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and Plasmodium (17Buscaglia C.A. Coppens I. Hol W.G.J. Nussenzweig V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4947-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Despite significant gains made in defining a role for the cytoplasmic domain of MIC2 using chimeric proteins expressed in vitro, the function of this domain within the native MIC2 is still unresolved. We demonstrate here that transgenic T. gondii parasites expressing a second copy of MIC2 lacking the C-domain display no defect in protein sorting, secretion, motility, or invasion. However, the C-domain deletion mutant was unable to replace wild-type MIC2, demonstrating an essential role for the C-domain in the function of the protein. Importantly, MIC2 and M2AP form a multimeric functional complex involved in cell invasion and this complex is likely to be prototypical of other TRAP family members. Growth of Host Cells and Toxoplasma Strains—T. gondii tachyzoites of the RH, RH hxgprt-, and RH Δm2ap- strains were maintained by growth in monolayers of human foreskin fibrobasts, propagated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 20 μg ml-1 gentamicin (referred to as complete medium). Cloning of mutΔC—Previously described epitope-tagged MIC2 expression plasmids served as the template DNA for PCR mutagenesis designed to remove the cytoplasmic domain encoding region of the MIC2 protein (10Brossier F.

Parasitol. 1998; 91: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment spanning 862 bp was amplified using a 5′ primer containing an internal BglII restriction site: 5′-CCTGGGACAGATCTACGAC-3′ anda3′ primer encoding a C-terminal HA9 epitope and containing a PacI restriction site: 5′GGGTTAATTAACTACGCGTAATCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTAATAGTAGTGGTAACTGGCTCC-3′. The PCR product was purified (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), digested with BglII and PacI (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA), and subcloned into a BglII-PacI-digested MIC2 expression plasmid (10Brossier F.

Parasitol. 1998; 91: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The c-Myc epitope was introduced to the MIC2ΔCHA9 sequence to complete the mutΔC construct by swapping DNA segments from the MIC2-TAG plasmid described previously (10Brossier F. Jewett T.J. Lovett J.L. Sibley L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6229-6234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Promoterless constructs were obtained by digesting all vectors with NotI and StuI removing a 1989-bp fragment from the expression vectors containing the MIC2 promoter and the first 489 nucleotides of the MIC2 gene. The sticky ends were filled in with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and the plasmids were ligated to yield the plasmids MIC2-TAG-P- and mutΔC-P-. Transfection of T. gondii—RH strain hxgprt- tachyzoites (obtained from David Roos, University of Pennsylvania) were transfected by electroporation as described previously (18Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Transfected parasites were incubated with host cells in the presence of complete medium containing 25 μg ml-1 mycophenolic acid (Sigma) and 50 μg ml-1 xanthine (Sigma). Immunoblotting and Antibodies—Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Polyclonal rabbit anti-MIC5 and rabbit anti-M2AP antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Vern Carruthers (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). The c-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody and polyclonal rabbit anti-HA9 antisera was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Polyclonal rabbit anti-human ferritin was purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal rabbit anti-C-domain antibody was produced by immunization of a rabbit with a construct consisting of the C-domain of MIC2 (residues 721–769) fused to the viral gene g10 as described previously (8Carruthers V.B. Sherman G.D. Sibley L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14346-14353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The MIC2-specific 6D10 monoclonal antibody was described previously (3Wan K.L. Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Ajioka J.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Polyclonal goat anti-rabbit aldolase and monoclonal control antibodies specific for human citrate synthase were purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Polyclonal rabbit anti-pyruvate kinase was a gift of Takashi Asai (Keio University, Tokyo, Japan). Polyclonal rabbit anti-thyroglobulin was taken from rabbits immunized with thyroglobulin-conjugated peptides (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc., Reamstown, PA). Immunoprecipitation—Thirty μl of polyclonal rabbit anti-C-domain, preimmune rabbit sera, anti-c-Myc, or monoclonal antibody control (anti-human citrate synthase) was added to 40 μl of rec-protein A-coated Sepharose beads in 200 μl of PBS (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). Following a 2-h incubation at 4 °C, antibody coated beads were washed twice with fresh PBS and once with gel filtration buffer, 140 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2 (GF buffer). 1 × 108 mutΔC parasites were suspended in GF buffer and disrupted by sonication delivered in three consecutive bursts of 15-s intervals on setting number 3 (550 Sonic Dismembrator equipped with microtip: Fisher Scientific). Insoluble material was removed by microcentrifugation (16,000 rcf, 15 min, 4 °C). Soluble lysate was added to the washed beads and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were washed five times with GF-buffer and the protein-coated beads were dissolved in 100 μl of protein sample buffer (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205511) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting with antibodies specific for MIC2, c-Myc, HA9, or the C-domain. Secretion Assay—Freshly isolated MIC2-TAG or mutΔC tachyzoites (1 × 107 parasites) were suspended in 100 μl of Hanks’ balanced salt solution, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EGTA in 1.5 ml of polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes, and exposed to 1% ethanol and 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (10 min, 1000 rcf, 10 °C), and the cell pellet was resuspended in 1× protein sample buffer. Supernatants were centrifuged (10 min, 1000 rcf, 10 °C), and 80 μl of the second supernatant was added to 20 μl of 5× protein sample buffer. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting with antibodies specific for MIC2, c-Myc, or HA9. Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—To localize epitope-tagged MIC2 within intracellular parasites, transgenic T. gondii were inoculated onto host cell monolayers on coverslips, grown overnight, and processed for immunofluorescence. Cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, washed in PBS-Ca2+, blocked with 5% fetal bovine serum for 20 min, and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100. Coverslips were incubated with antibodies specific for c-Myc and MIC5 for 1 h. After four washes in PBS, secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 488 (green) or Alexa 594 (red) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were added for 45 min. Coverslips were rinsed and mounted in Vectashield containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells were examined using a Zeiss Axioplan (Carl Zeiss, Inc., New York) microscope equipped with phase contrast and epifluorescence optics. Images were obtained using a Zeiss Axiocam-cooled CCD camera directed by Zeiss Axiovision software, version 3.0 including a deconvolution package and processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). The results shown are representative of three or more similar experiments. Electron Microscopy—For immunolocalization at the electron microscopy level, infected cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.5% glutaraldehyde (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) in 100 mm PIPES, 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2, for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were then embedded in 10% gelatin and infiltrated overnight with 2.3 m sucrose, 20% polyvinyl pyrrolidone in PIPES, MgCl2 at 4 °C. Samples were trimmed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and sectioned with a Leica Ultracut UCT cryo-ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems Inc., Bannockburn, IL). Sections were probed with rabbit anti-HA followed by 18 nm colloidal gold conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Parallel controls omitting the primary antibody were consistently negative at the concentration of colloidal gold conjugated secondary antibodies used in these studies. Sections were stained with 0.3% uranyl acetate, 2% methyl cellulose and viewed on a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope (JEOL USA Inc., Peabody, MA). Native Blue Gels (NBG)—NBG were employed to obtain protein size estimates. Briefly, purified tachyzoites (1 × 107) or parasite-derived supernantant from a secretion assay (see secretion assay above) were brought to a final volume of 100 μl in 1× NB sample buffer (0.5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, 50 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, 10 mm BisTris/HCl, pH 7.0, 3% sucrose). Protein samples were cycled through three rounds of freezing and thawing to disrupt any intact parasites. Samples were then analyzed by 5, 8, or 5–13% gradient blue native-PAGE (20Schågger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 21Schågger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). Initial electrophoresis conditions include 1X cathode buffer with dye (50 mm Tricine, 15 mm BisTris, and 0.01% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250) and 1× anode buffer (50 mm BisTris/HCl, pH 7.0). After 1 h at 100 volts, the cathode buffer was exchanged for the same buffer without the Coomassie dye. Protein markers for the NBGs were obtained as a high molecular weight calibration kit for native electrophoresis purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Little Chalfont Buckinghamshire, UK). Western blotting the NBGs was the same as described above with the additional step of soaking the gel in SDS-PAGE buffer for 10 min prior to wet transfer (25 mm Tris base, 200 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS). The migration distance of protein standards were determined and plotted against the log of their respective molecular weight. Linear regression from these data provided estimates for the molecular weight of the MIC2, mutΔC, MIC2·M2AP full-length, and secreted complexes. Flow Cytometry—Transfected parasites were isolated from host cell monolayers and stained with epitope tag-specific antibodies. The parasite population was analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the relative frequency of recombinants. Cell suspensions (1 × 107 ml-1) were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, washed in PBS, and blocked with 10% FBS, and 0.02% saponin for 20 min. Parasites were stained with the epitope tag-specific antibodies, c-Myc and HA9, for 1 h. After three washes in PBS, secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 488 (FL1) or 594 (FL2) (Molecular Probes) were added for 1 h. After staining, cells were washed in PBS and 1 × 105 cells were analyzed using a FACscan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA). Data were analyzed using Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems). Parasites were washed in a PBS-buffered solution containing 0.01% saponin by centrifugation in a 5417R Eppendorf centrifuge with A-8–11 rotor (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at 800 rcf for 2 min, 20 °C. Gel Filtration—Extracellular tachyzoites were suspended in GF buffer and disrupted by sonication as described above. Insoluble material was removed by microcentrifugation (16,000 rcf, 15 min, 4 °C). 600 μl of parasite lysate supplemented with 200 μg of human liver ferritin (Research Diagnostics, Inc., Flanders, NJ) and 200 μg of thyroglobulin (Sigma) was added to a 1-meter-long 1.5-cm inner diameter column (Bio-Rad) containing Sepharose 6B (Sigma). One-ml factions were collected and analyzed by Western blot (see above description of antibodies used). The peak fractions harboring the proteins thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), pyruvate kinase (240 kDa), and aldolase (158 kDa) and MIC2·M2AP were identified and plotted against the log of their respective molecular weight. Linear regression from these data provided estimates for the molecular weight of the MIC2 and MIC2·M2AP complexes. Peak fractions harboring the MIC2 or MIC2·M2AP complexes were determined by phosphorimage analysis of Western blots on a Fujifilm FLA-5000 (Fujifilm Medical Systems Inc., Stamford, CT) directed by Image Reader FLA-5000 V2.0 and quantified in Image Gauge V4.0 (Fuji Photofilm Co. LTD). The Cytoplasmic Domain of MIC2 Is Not Required for Correct Localization and Secretion of Mutant Proteins Expressed as Pseudodiploid Transgenes—The C-domain of TRAP family members is involved in association with the cytoskeleton of the parasite (15Jewett T.J. Sibley L.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 885-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 17Buscaglia C.A. Coppens I. Hol W.G.J. Nussenzweig V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4947-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To better ascertain the significance of this interaction, a mutant mic2 protein lacking the C-domain was expressed as an epitope-tagged transgene in parasites that also contained wild-type MIC2. MutΔC was localized to the apical region of the parasite as demonstrated by its colocalization with microneme protein five (MIC5) (Fig. 1A) (22Brydges S.D. Sherman G.D. Nockemann S. Loyens A. Dåubener W. Dubremetz J. Carruthers V.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 51-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To ensure that the apical pattern of mutΔC was due to localization within micronemes and not another apical vesicle, cryoimmunoelectron microscopy was employed. Immunogold labeling of epitope-tagged mic2 proteins was restricted to the apical microneme vesicles as determined by electron microscopy (Fig. 1B). The contents of the parasite micronemes are released during recognition of a suitable host cell as a result of membrane fusion of the microneme vesicles with the parasite plasma membrane (5Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 114-123PubMed Google Scholar). Secretion can be artificially induced in the absence of host cells using agonists, and the amount of secreted proteins can be assessed by quantitative SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (4Carruthers V.B. Moreno S.N.J. Sibley L.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 6Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Following induced secretion, mutΔC was secreted at comparable levels to endogenous MIC2 and epitope-tagged control MIC2 proteins (Fig. 2). The secreted MIC2 proteins were missing their extreme C termini as shown by the absence of the HA9 epitope (Fig. 2). Expression of mutΔCA as a pseudodiploid transgene had no discernable effect on parasite motility or invasion when tested as previously described (7Carruthers V.B. Giddings O.K. Sibley L.D. Cell Microbiol. 1999; 1: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 10Brossier F. Jewett T.J. Lovett J.L. Sibley L.D. J. Biol.

The MIC2 Protein Forms Multimeric Complexes—Protein complexes are implicated in the correct targeting of soluble microneme proteins (13Rabenau K.E. Sohrabi A. Tripathy A. Reitter C. Ajioka J.W.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To test whether mutΔC was capable of associating with endogenous MIC2, the full-length MIC2 protein was immunoprecipitated with antisera specific to the cytoplasmic domain. Cosedimenting proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. The association of mutΔC was confirmed by detection of the c-Myc tagged protein (Fig. 3A). MutΔC was not immunoprecipitated with the prebleed control sera (Fig. 3A). Conversely, when the mutΔC protein was immunoprecipitated with antisera specific for the c-Myc epitope, endogenous MIC2 was detected using antisera specific to the C-domain (Fig. 3B). Control sera failed to immunoprecipitate endogenous MIC2 (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that MIC2 forms multimers that also contain the mutΔC form of the protein. MIC2 and M2AP Form a Complex of ∼450 Kilodaltons—The approximate size of the MIC2·M2AP complex was determined by relative migration in NBGs (20Schågger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 21Schågger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). Parasite associated MIC2·M2AP complex migrated with the 440-kDa marker of the native protein standards (Fig. 4A, Table I), while secreted MIC2·M2AP, lacking the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains, was ∼392 kDa (Fig. 4A, Table I). Additional M2AP reactive bands found at the top and the bottom of the gel likely represent insoluble protein that failed to migrate into the gel and degradation products, respectively. To determine the role of the M2AP protein in complex formation, protein lysates generated from Δm2ap parasites were compared with the wild-type RH strain. The MIC2 protein derived from Δm2ap parasites migrated at a distinct band of 335 kDa (Fig. 4B, Table I). To ensure that mutΔC was also contained within the larger complex, protein lysates generated from transgenic parasites were compared with lysates from wild-type parasites. The mutΔC protein migrated similar to wild-type MIC2 in the NBGs (Fig. 4B, Table I), indicating that it was complexed with the native protein.Table IRelative size estimates for MIC2·M2AP and MIC2 complexes in T. gondii Protein lysates and secretory fractions from parasites expressing wild-type MIC2·M2AP or MIC2 alone were separated by either gel filtration on native blue gels and the average size of complexes determined as described under “Materials and Methods.”FormGel filtrationNative blue gelsMIC2·M2AP cell pellet465,000 Da433,000 ± 30,888 Da450,000 Da(n = 2)(n = 10)MIC2·M2AP secretedNDaND, not determined387,000 ± 44,654 Da(n = 3)Δm2ap cell pellet330,000 Da335,000 ± 6215 Da(n = 1)(n = 3)a ND, not determined Open table in a new tab To further investigate the size of MIC2·M2AP complexes, gel filtration on Sepharose 6B was employed. Western blot analysis of collected fractions revealed that MIC2·M2AP eluted in peak fractions corresponding to a size range of 465–450 kDa (Fig. 5A, Table I). Protein lysates derived from Δm2ap revealed that MIC2 alone formed complexes that eluted in peak fractions corresponding to 330 kDa (Fig. 5B, Table I). To compare the relative migration of MIC2·M2AP and MIC2 alone, the distribution of these complexes was plotted relative to the ferritin marker as shown graphically in Fig. 5C. The Cytoplasmic Domain of MIC2 Is Essential for Survival—As there was no apparent phenotype associated with mutΔC when expressed as a pseudodiploid, the replacement of endogenous MIC2 with mutΔC was attempted. Promoterless plasmids were designed to allow for specific integration at the MIC2 locus. The presence of two epitope tags, c-Myc upstream of the transmembrane domain and HA9 at the end of the C-dom"

The importance of cathepsin L for infection of other cell types is unknown. Here we report that the acid-independent lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin S mediates outer capsid processing in macrophage-like P388D cells. P388D cells supported infection by virions of strain Lang, but not strain c43. Genetic studies revealed that this difference is determined by S4, the viral gene segment that encodes σ3. c43-derived subvirion particles that lack σ3 replicated normally in P388D cells, suggesting that the difference in infectivity of Lang and c43 virions is at the level of σ3 processing. Infection of P388D cells with Lang virions was inhibited by the broad spectrum cysteine protease inhibitor trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane but not by NH4Cl, which raises the endocytic pH and thereby inhibits acid-dependent proteases such as cathepsins L and B. Outer capsid processing and infection of P388D cells with Lang virions were also inhibited by a cathepsin S-specific inhibitor. Furthermore, in the presence of NH4Cl, cell lines engineered to express cathepsin S supported infection by Lang, but not c43, virions. Our results thus indicate that differences in susceptibility to cathepsin S-mediated σ3 processing are responsible for strain differences in reovirus infection of macrophage-like P388D cells and other cathepsin S-expressing cells. Additionally, our data suggest that the acid dependence of reovirus infections of most other cell types may reflect the low pH requirement for the activities of most other lysosomal proteases rather, than some other acid-dependent aspect of cell entry.

They are prototypical members of the Reoviridae family, which also includes the pathogenic rotaviruses, coltiviruses, and orbiviruses. Although reoviruses infect humans, typically by the enteric or respiratory route, they are generally not associated with serious disease. In contrast, infections in animal models can result in severe diseases of the enteric, respiratory, and central nervous systems (2Tyler K.L. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 4th Ed. Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 1729-1746Google Scholar). Reovirus virions are composed of two concentric icosahedral protein capsids that surround the genome (3Nibert M.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 233: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar). The outer capsid includes 600 copies each of the proteins σ3 and μ1 (4Coombs K.M.

Proteolytic removal of σ3 is thought to allow μ1 the conformational mobility it needs to perform its roles in membrane penetration, transcriptase activation, and entry into the cytoplasm. The removal of σ3 is an essential step in the reovirus life cycle (21Sturzenbecker L.J. Nibert M. Furlong D. Fields B.N. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Baer G.S.

It is not yet clear whether low pH is required only to activate an essential acid-dependent protease, or whether it is also required for some other aspect of cell entry by reovirus, such as an essential conformational change in σ3 or σ1 (21Sturzenbecker L.J.

Recently, the acid-dependent lysosomal cysteine protease Cat L has been shown to be necessary for efficient processing of the outer capsid in murine fibroblasts 3D. L. Jones, S. Kothandaraman, R. L. Margraf, and M. L. Nibert, unpublished observations. (40Baer G.S. Ebert D.H. Chung C.J. Erickson A.H. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9532-9543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Ebert D.H. Deussing J. Peters C. Dermody T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24609-24617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A role has also been suggested for Cat B 3D. L. Jones, S. Kothandaraman, R. L. Margraf, and M. L. Nibert, unpublished observations. (43Ebert D.H. Deussing J. Peters C. Dermody T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24609-24617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It is not known whether Cats L and/or B mediate outer capsid processing in all permissive cells or whether other proteases may be involved. Although a wide variety of proteases have been shown to mediate outer capsid processing in vitro (11Nibert M.L. Fields B.N. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Borsa J.

Schiff L.A. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5184-5197Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), data suggest that a degree of specificity exists as to the proteases that can mediate these cleavages in cells. For example, aspartic proteases such as Cat D appear to be negligibly involved in removing σ3 from the virions of wild-type reovirus strains in L929 and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (39Kothandaraman S. Hebert M.C. Raines R.T. Nibert M.L. Virology. 1998; 251: 264-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We began to investigate reovirus infection in a macrophage-like cell line, P388D, because during natural infections by the enteric route, primary replication of some reoviruses is thought to occur in mononuclear cells within Peyer’s patches (46Bass D.M. Trier J.S. Dambrauskas R. Wolf J.L. Lab. Invest. 1988; 58: 226-235PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophages may also represent important early targets during natural infections by the respiratory route (47Morin M.J. Warner A. Fields B.N. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 541-548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that σ3 processing in P388D cells is mediated by Cat S. Cat S is a lysosomal cysteine protease that shares closest amino acid homology with Cats L and K (48Buhling F. Fengler A. Brandt W. Welte T. Ansorge S. Nagler D.K. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 477: 241-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is expressed predominantly in antigen-presenting cells, including B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages (49Morton P.A. Zacheis M.L. Giacoletto K.S. Manning J.A. Schwartz B.D. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 137-150PubMed Google Scholar, 50Shi G.P. Munger J.S. Meara J.P. Rich D.H. Chapman H.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11530-11536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unusual for a lysosomal cysteine protease, Cat S maintains substantial activity at neutral and mildly alkaline pH (52Kirschke H. Wiederanders B. Bromme D. Rinne A. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 467-473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several physiological roles have been ascribed to Cat S. Recent studies indicate that it is essential for peptide loading onto major MHC class II molecules, in that it mediates proteolytic removal of invariant chain from the immature MHC assembly (53Riese R.J. Wolf P.R. Bromme D. Natkin L.R. Villadangos J.A. Ploegh H.L. Chapman H.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 357-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Additionally, Cat S may play a role in the generation of antigenic peptides for display by MHC class II molecules (54Hsieh C.S. deRoos P. Honey K. Beers C. Rudensky A.Y. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2618-2625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other investigations have suggested that it functions in angiogenesis and remodeling of extracellular matrices (55Reddy V.Y. Zhang Q.Y. Weiss S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3849-3853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56Shi G.P. Sukhova G.K. Kuzuya M. Ye Q. Du J. Zhang Y. Pan J.H. Lu M.L. Cheng X.W. Iguchi A. Perrey S. Lee A.M. Chapman H.A. Libby P. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Aberrant Cat S expression has been observed in some diseased tissues including those from Alzheimer’s and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease patients (57Munger J.S. Haass C. Lemere C.A. Shi G.P. Wong W.S. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Chapman H.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 299-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 58Lemere C.A. Munger J.S. Shi G.P. Natkin L. Haass C. Chapman H.A. Selkoe D.J. Am. J.

Virol. 2002; 76: 10905-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Other new results in this study demonstrated that reovirus virions that can productively infect Cat S-expressing cells, such as those of strain Lang, and can do so equally well in the absence or presence of agents that raise endocytic pH. These findings suggest that the acid dependence of reovirus infections in most other cell types may reflect the low pH requirement for the activities of most other lysosomal proteases, rather than some other acid-dependent feature of cell entry. Our results also demonstrate that virions of some reovirus strains, exemplified by c43, do not infect P388D cells efficiently because their σ3 proteins are poorly susceptible to Cat S-mediated cleavage. Thus, our findings indicate that lysosomal proteases can represent important cell type-specific host factors for reovirus infection and support the hypothesis that lysosomal protease expression is a determinant of reovirus tropism and pathogenesis in infected hosts. Cells and Viruses—Murine L929 cells were maintained as suspension cultures as described previously (61Kedl R. Schmechel S. Schiff L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 552-559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). P388D cells were maintained in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented to contain 15% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 4.5 g/liter glucose as well as 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Raw 264.7 cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in RPMI medium supplemented to contain 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Immortalized MEFs lacking the Cat L gene (MEF9.C2 Cat L–/–) and the same cells expressing either Cat L or Cat S (MEF:CatL or MEF:CatS, respectively), were a gift from Dr. Alexander Rudensky (54Hsieh C.S. deRoos P. Honey K. Beers C. Rudensky A.Y. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2618-2625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were maintained as monolayer cultures in RPMI medium supplemented to contain 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. NIH3T3 and 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented to contain 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. 293 cells stably expressing Cat S (293:CatS) were a gift from Dr. Bernd Wiederanders (62Kreusch S. Fehn M. Maubach G. Nissler K. Rommerskirch W. Schilling K. Weber E. Wenz I. Wiederanders B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2965-2972Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and were maintained in the same manner as the parental 293 cells except that 500 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem) was included in the medium. Reoviruses serotype 1 Lang, serotype 3 Dearing, and serotype 3 clone 87 (c87) (also called Abney) are prototypical laboratory strains. Reoviruses serotype 3 c43, serotype 3 clone 100 (c100), and serotype 3 clone 31 (c31) were originally isolated by Rosen et al. (63Rosen L. Hovis J.F. Mastrota F.M. Bell J.A. Huebner R.J. Am. J. Hyg. 1960; 71: 258-265PubMed Google Scholar, 64Rosen L. Am. J. Hyg. 1960; 71: 242-249PubMed Google Scholar) and have been utilized in a number of previous studies (61Kedl R. Schmechel S. Schiff L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 552-559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 65Dermody T.S. Nibert M.L. Bassel-Duby R. Fields B.N. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5173-5176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Third passage cell lysate stocks of reovirus were prepared in L929 cells. Purified virions were prepared by CsCl density gradient centrifugation of extracts from cells infected with third passage stocks (66Furlong D.B. Nibert M.L. Fields B.N. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 246-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified virions containing 35S-labeled proteins were prepared by adding 5 mCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine in the form of EasyTag express protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to cell suspensions (2 × 108 cells at 5 × 105 cells/ml) at 17 h postinfection ISVPs were prepared by treating purified virions with chymotrypsin as described elsewhere (11Nibert M.L. Fields B.N. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of Viral Growth—Cells were infected at the indicated multiplicities of infection, and adsorption was allowed to proceed for 1 h on ice at 4 °C. A multiplicity of 0.1 pfu/cell was used for growth curve experiments because we found that it maximized the strain-dependent replication differences in P388D cells. After adsorption, cells were concentrated by low speed centrifugation and resuspended in fresh medium. Virus and cells were then added to 3-dram vials (2 × 105 cells/vial) containing 1 ml of cold medium. Triplicate samples were prepared for each time point. One set of samples (time zero) was frozen immediately at –20 °C. The remaining samples were placed in a humidified 37 °C CO2 incubator until the desired time point was reached. Harvested samples were subjected to three cycles of freezing and thawing and titrated by plaque assay on L929 cells as described elsewhere (67Virgin IV, H.W. Bassel-Duby R. Fields B.N. Tyler K.L. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4594-4604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viral yields were calculated according to the following equation. Viralyield=log10(pfu/ml)t=xh-log10(pfu/ml)t=0±S.D.(Eq. 1) Some cells were treated with 300 μm E-64 (Sigma), 100 nm bafilomycin A1 (Sigma), 5 μm CA-074 (Calbiochem), or 20 mm NH4Cl with or without 10 nm LHVS, an irreversible inhibitor specific for Cat S (53Riese R.J.

Chem. 1995; 38: 3193-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). LHVS was a generous gift from Dr. Hidde Ploegh (Harvard Medical School). Cells were treated with inhibitors for 3 h before and then throughout the infection. Generation of Viral Reassortants—Reassortant viruses were generated by coinfecting L929 cells with strains Lang and c43 over a range of relative multiplicities. Plaques were amplified on L929 cells, and genotypes of the first passage stocks were determined by using a combination of methods. The parental origins of 8 of the 10 dsRNA segments were determined easily by characterizing electrophoretic mobility of dsRNA on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described previously (70Ramig R.F. White R.M. Fields B.N. Science. 1977; 195: 406-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 71Sharpe A.H. Ramig R.F. Mustoe T.A. Fields B.N. Virology. 1978; 84: 63-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The parental origins of the remaining two segments, L1 and M3, were determined by using restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Viral RNA was isolated from infected cells by phenol/chloroform extraction. Recovered RNA served as a template for cDNA synthesis by reverse transcription-PCR. Primers corresponding to the first 15 plus strand nucleotides of the L1 segment (GCTACACGTTCCACG) (72Wiener J.R. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1989; 169: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or the first 21 nucleotides of the M3 segment (GCTAAAGTCACCGTGGTCATG) (73Wiener J.R. Bartlett J.A. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1989; 169: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) were used in the reverse transcription reaction. The products of this reaction were amplified by PCR using the following primer sets. For the L1 segments, we used ATGTCATCCATGATACTG, corresponding to plus strand nucleotides 19–36, and TGGTGACATTAACC, complementary to plus strand nucleotides 665–677. For the M3 segments, we used CGTTCACAATCCTTCACT, corresponding to plus strand nucleotides 109–126, and TTACAACTCATCAGTTGG, complementary to plus strand nucleotides 2161–2178. The products of these reactions were phenol/chloroform extracted, precipitated in ethanol, and digested with DdeI. These digestions produced unique patterns of restriction fragments for Lang and c43 L1 and M3 cDNAs, which could be resolved on 1% agarose TAE (40 mm Tris, 0.1% acetic acid, 1 mm EDTA) gels. Analysis of Intracellular Proteolysis of Reovirus Virions—Prior to infection, some cells were pretreated overnight with 5 nm LHVS. 1 × 106 cells/sample were incubated with [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled Lang virions (5 × 105 cpm/sample) or c43 virions (1 × 106 cpm/sample) in 0.5 ml of culture medium for 1 h at 4 °C. After adsorption, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to remove unbound virions, plated in 35-mm culture dishes, and covered with fresh medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. For samples pretreated with LHVS, the inhibitor was included in the fresh culture medium. Time zero samples were collected immediately, and remaining samples were transferred to a humidified 37 °CCO2 incubator. At the indicated times postinfection, cells were removed from culture dishes and concentrated by low speed centrifugation for 10 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and incubated for 10 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 716 × g to pellet nuclei. Proteins were precipitated from the supernatants using acetone (21Sturzenbecker L.J. Nibert M. Furlong D. Fields B.N. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, solubilized in protein sample buffer (0.125 m Tris (pH 8.0), 1% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 10% sucrose, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol), and re"
https://openalex.org/W2118725775,"Ilicicolin H is an antibiotic isolated from the “imperfect” fungus Cylindrocladium iliciola strain MFC-870. Ilicicolin inhibits mitochondrial respiration by inhibiting the cytochrome bc1 complex. In order to identify the site of ilicicolin action within the bc1 complex we have characterized the effects of ilicicolin on the cytochrome bc1 complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ilicicolin inhibits ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity of the yeast bc1 complex with an IC50 of 3–5 nm, while 200–250 nm ilicicolin was required to obtain comparable inhibition of the bovine bc1 complex. Ilicicolin blocks oxidation-reduction of cytochrome b through center N of the bc1 complex and promotes oxidant-induced reduction of cytochrome b but has no effect on oxidation of ubiquinol through center P. These results indicate that ilicicolin binds to the Qn site of the bc1 complex. Ilicicolin induces a blue shift in the absorption spectrum of ferro-cytochrome b, and titration of the spectral shift indicates binding of one inhibitor molecule per Qn site. The effects of ilicicolin on electron transfer reactions in the bc1 complex are similar to those of antimycin, another inhibitor that binds to the Qn site of the bc1 complex. However, because the two inhibitors have different effects on the absorption spectrum of cytochrome b, they differ in their mode of binding to the Qn site.

However, because the two inhibitors have different effects on the absorption spectrum of cytochrome b, they differ in their mode of binding to the Qn site. Electron transfer through the cytochrome bc1 complex occurs by the protonmotive Q cycle mechanism in which ubiquinol is oxidized at one center, referred to as center P, and ubiquinone is re-reduced at a second center, referred to as center N (1Mitchell P. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 327-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Numerous inhibitors that act specifically at center P or center N within the bc1 complex have been discovered and characterized (2Von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The so-called Qp inhibitors block oxidation of ubiquinol at center P and prevent reduction of the high potential redox centers of the bc1 complex, cytochrome c1, and the Rieske protein. The Qp inhibitors include stigmatellin, hydroxyquinones, and methoxyacrylates such as myxothiazol and methoxyacrylate (MOA)-stilbene. These inhibitors are generally thought to mimic intermediate states during ubiquinol oxidation. The bc1 complexes from chicken, bovine, and yeast mitochondria have been crystallized with stigmatellin bound (3Zhang Z. Huang L. Schulmeister V.M. Chi Y-I. Kim K-K. Hung L-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A.

Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), and the yeast enzyme has also been crystallized with a hydroxyquinone anion bound (6Palsdottir H. Gomez-Lojero C. Trumpower B.L. Hunte C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31303-31311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Consequently, a significant amount of detailed structural information is available regarding the binding of these Qp inhibitors. The Qn inhibitors block reduction of ubiquinone by cytochrome bH at center N and also block reduction of cytochrome b by ubiquinol that can occur by reversal of this reaction. At present there are two antibiotics that inhibit at the Qn site of the bc1 complex. Antimycin is a natural product of various species of Streptomyces and is one of the most extensively studied inhibitors of the bc1 complex (7Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 301: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Antimycin binds with high affinity (Kd = 3.2 × 10–11) close to heme bH of cytochrome b and causes a red shift in the α band of the optical spectrum of the ferro-cytochrome b. The crystal structure of the chicken bc1 complex with antimycin bound shows that the antimycin binding site is near the high potential (bH) heme of cytochrome b and surrounded by adjacent residues from helices A, D, and E (3Zhang Z. Huang L. Schulmeister V.M. Chi Y-I. Kim K-K. Hung L-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S-H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). The aromatic ring of the inhibitor is in close proximity to the heme, as expected from the quenching of the inhibitor fluorescence when bound to the bc1 complex (7Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 301: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 8Berden J.A. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 256: 199-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Funiculosin, an antibiotic isolated from Penicillium funiculosum Thom, also inhibits at the Qn site. However, funiculosin is no longer available and thus little is known about the structural details of its binding, although it is generally assumed to bind in a manner similar to antimycin (2Von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Ilicicolin H is one of several ilicicolin antibiotics isolated from the “imperfect” fungus Cylindrocladium iliciola strain MFC-870 (9Hayakawa S. Minato H. Katagiri K. J. Antibiot. 1971; 24: 653-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Ilicicolin was cytotoxic against HeLa cells but had only limited antibacterial activity. Subsequent studies showed that it was also toxic to various yeast, and characterization of ilicicolin H effects on mitochondria suggested that the inhibitor acts at the level of the cytochrome bc1 complex. 1J. Onishi, submitted for publication. In the experiments reported below we characterize the effects of ilicicolin H on the purified yeast bc1 complex. We show that ilicicolin H is a Qn site inhibitor and compare its effects to those of antimycin, another inhibitor of the bc1 complex that also acts at the Qn site of the enzyme. Materials—Dodecylmaltoside was obtained from Roche Applied Science. DEAE-Biogel and ammonium persulfate were obtained from BioRad Laboratories. Antimycin, diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, menadione, and dithionite were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Stigmatellin was purchased from Fluka Biochemica. Ilicicolin H was obtained from the Merck sample repository. Purification of bc1 Complexes—Yeast cytochrome bc1 complex was isolated from yeast mitochondrial membranes as described previously (10Ljungdahl P.O. Pennoyer J.D. Robertson D.E. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 891: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 11Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31209-31216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The bovine bc1 complex was prepared from beef heart mitochondrial membranes using the same protocol for the yeast bc1 complex, except that the membranes were extracted with 1.2 g of dodecyl maltoside per gram of protein, compared with 0.8 g of dodecyl maltoside per gram of protein used to extract the yeast enzyme. Determination of Inhibitor Concentrations—Inhibitors were diluted in ethanol and the concentrations were determined from optical spectra obtained in an Aminco DW2a™ UV/visible spectrophotometer with the OLIS (On-Line Instrument Systems Inc. Bogart, GA) DW2 conversion and OLIS Software. The spectrum, after subtracting the ethanol background, was recorded from 230 to 400 nm. To accurately determine the concentration for each inhibitor, the absorbance was measured at concentrations that yielded 0.1–0.15 absorbance units after diluting stock solutions of the inhibitors. To minimize random dilution errors, each dilution was performed 5 or 6 times, and the diluted solutions were combined. The extinction coefficients used to calculate the concentrations of the stock solutions were, for antimycin, 4.8 mm–1 cm–1 at 320 nm; for stigmatellin, 65.5 mm–1 cm–1 at 267 nm; for ilicicolin H 23.2 nm–1 cm–1 at 248 nm and 5.3 mm–1 cm–1 at 349 nm (2Von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 9Hayakawa S. Minato H. Katagiri K. J. Antibiot. 1971; 24: 653-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All of the inhibitor dilutions were prepared daily, and the concentrations were determined before use. Determination of bc1 Complex Concentrations—For each inhibitor titration, the bc1 complex was prediluted to ∼3 μm in assay buffer minus cytochrome c, and the concentration determined by difference spectra recorded in the Aminco DW2a™ spectrophotometer. The cytochrome c1 concentration was determined from the difference spectrum of the ascorbate-reduced versus ferricyanide-oxidized enzyme, using an extinction coefficient of 17.5 mm–1 cm–1 at 553–539 nm (12Cavazzoni M. Svobodova J. Desantis A. Fato R. Lenaz G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Cytochrome b concentration was determined from the difference spectrum of the sodium dithionite-reduced minus ascorbate-reduced enzyme using an extinction coefficient of 25 mm–1 cm–1 at 563–578 nm (13Degli-Esposti M. Tsai A-L. Palmer G. Lenaz G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The activity of this stock solution of enzyme was stable for a week at 4 °C. Ubiquinol-Cytochrome c Reductase Assays with 2.5 nm bc1 Complex— Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activities of the purified bc1 complexes were assayed at room temperature in assay buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm sodium azide, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.01% Tween-20. After determining the bc1 complex concentration, the enzyme was diluted daily a second time with the same buffer to 90 nm and incubated on ice for 30 min prior to the activity measurements. To initiate the assay an aliquot of the enzyme was diluted to a final concentration of 2.5 nm in assay buffer containing 40 μm cytochrome c and 0.5 mm potassium cyanide. The reaction was started by adding the ubiquinol analog, decyl-ubiquinol (DBH2), 2The abbreviations used are: DBH2, decylubiquinol; 3-FASA, 3-formamidosalicylic acid. to a final concentration of 50 μm and reduction of cytochrome c was monitored at 550–539 nm with the Aminco DW2a™ spectrophotometer in the dual wavelength mode. The extinction coefficient used to calculate cytochrome c reduction was 21.5 mm–1 cm–1 at 550–539 nm (14Margoliash E. Walasek O.F. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 339-348Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The activity of the bc1 complex without inhibitor and after stirring 2 min in the assay buffer was determined at the beginning of each titration. This was taken as 100% activity for the inhibitor titration. Under these conditions, and after 2 min stirring, the activity of the enzyme was always between 180 and 200 s–1. At the end of each titration the activity of the bc1 complex without inhibitor was again determined to check the stability of the enzyme during the experiment. Since the enzyme was preincubated with inhibitors in the assay buffer containing cytochrome c we could not correct for the non-enzymatic rate of cytochrome c reduction by DBH2 at the beginning of each measurement (see Ref. 15Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1195-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Instead, the non-enzymatic rate of reduction of cytochrome c by DBH2 was measured in the absence of enzyme and subtracted from each activity trace. Ubiquinol-Cytochrome c Reductase Assays with 50 nm bc1 Complex— Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activities using higher enzyme concentrations were measured at room temperature by stopped flow rapid scanning spectroscopy, using an OLIS-Rapid Scanning Monochromator, which is described below. Reactions were started by mixing 100 nm bc1 complex in assay buffer with 0.5 mm potassium cyanide and 100 μm DBH2 against an equal volume of 100 μm cytochrome c in assay buffer. The inhibitors were incubated with the bc1 complex for 2 min before mixing into the stopped flow chamber. The non-enzymatic rate of reduction of cytochrome c by DBH2 was obtained by mixing equal volumes of 100 μm cytochrome c in assay buffer against 100 μm DBH2 in assay buffer. The reaction was followed for 2 s. For each inhibitor concentration, four data sets were averaged, and the non-enzymatic rate was subtracted from each scan. From the three-dimensional data set comprised of wavelength, absorbance, and time, the time course of cytochrome c reduction was extracted using the OLIS software. The rate of cytochrome c reduction was calculated from the absorbance increase at 550 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 18.5 mm–1 cm–1 (16Kubota T Yoshikawa S. Matsubara H. J. Biochem. 1992; 111: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Reduction of Decyl-ubiquinone—The ubiquinol analog, decyl-ubiquinol (DBH2) used as substrate in the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase assays was obtained by reducing the quinone as described previously (15Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1195-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The concentration of DBH2 was determined by the amount of cytochrome c reduced in a catalytic assay, allowing the reaction to proceed to completion. Presteady State Reduction of Cytochrome b—Presteady state reduction of cytochrome b was followed at room temperature by stopped flow rapid scanning spectroscopy using the OLIS Rapid Scanning Monochromator (17Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The spectrophotometer was equipped with a 1200 lines/nm grating blazed at 500 nm. This produced a 75-nm spectrum, centered at 550 nm, with a resolution of 0.4 nm. The dead time of the instrument was 2 ms, and the end of this period was chosen as time 0. Data was collected at 1000 scans/s. Reactions were started by rapidly mixing 3 μm bc1 complex in assay buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm sodium azide, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.01% Tween-20 with an equal volume of the same buffer containing 50 μm menadiol. A fresh solution of menadiol substrate was prepared from menadione before each experiment as described previously (17Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The bc1 complex was diluted shortly before each titration. The exact bc1 concentration was determined by difference spectra recorded in the Aminco DW2a™ spectrophotometer as indicated above. To determine the titer for inhibition of cytochrome b reduction with antimycin or ilicicolin H, the inhibitors were incubated with the enzyme 2 min before starting the reaction. The enzyme was premixed with a 2-fold excess of stigmatellin to block the reaction through center P. A spectrum of the oxidized bc1 complex was obtained by mixing the oxidized bc1 complex with assay buffer and averaging the data sets to a single scan. For each inhibitor concentration, three data sets were averaged, and the oxidized spectrum was subtracted from each scan. From the three-dimensional data set comprised of wavelength, absorbance and time, the time course and amplitude change for cytochrome b reduction at 563 nm was extracted using the OLIS software. Oxidant-induced Reduction of Cytochrome b—The oxidant-induced reduction of cytochrome b was followed at room temperature by stopped flow rapid scanning spectroscopy using the OLIS-Rapid Scanning Monochromator. Prior to mixing to initiate the oxidant-induced reduction, 3 μmbc1 complex was incubated for 15 min with 8 μm antimycin or ilicicolin H in assay buffer, pH 7.0, without NaN3, and 30 μm DBH2 to partially reduce the enzyme. A spectrum of the mixture of cytochrome c plus cytochrome c oxidase was obtained by mixing with an equal volume of assay buffer, and the data set was averaged to one scan. Oxidant-induced reduction reactions were started by mixing the partially reduced enzyme against an equal volume of buffer containing 6 μm cytochrome c oxidase and 30 μm cytochrome c. For each inhibitor, three data sets were averaged, and the spectrum of cytochrome c plus cytochrome c oxidase was subtracted from each scan. From the data sets the amplitude change for cytochrome b reduction was obtained as described above. Measurement of the Absorbance Shift in the Cytochrome b Spectrum—The bc1 complex was diluted to ∼3 μm in assay buffer, pH 7.0, and the concentration was determined as described above. A baseline was obtained by reducing the bc1 complex with dithionite in both sample and reference cuvettes in the Aminco DW2a™ spectrophotometer. Increasing amounts of antimycin were added to the sample cuvette and an equal amount of ethanol to the reference cuvette. After allowing the inhibitor to equilibrate with the enzyme in the cuvette, a difference spectrum was recorded for each concentration of inhibitor added. For each inhibitor concentration the absorbance difference at 565–558 nm was determined. The same procedure was used to measure the blue shift induced by ilicicolin H binding, except that the absorbance difference at 559–563 nm was determined. To demonstrate that the ilicicolin-induced blue shift is eliminated by antimycin and not by stigmatellin, the inhibitors were added at 4.5 μm to the dithionite-reduced bc1 complex, and optical spectra were recorded until no further change in the spectrum was observed. Comparison of Ilicicolin H to Antimycin and Funiculosin— The structures of antimycin, funiculosin, and ilicicolin H are shown in Fig. 1. The first two are known Qn inhibitors. Antimycin consists of a 3-formamidosalicylic acid (3-FASA) linked via an amide bond to an alkyl- and acyl-substituted dilactone ring. It has been known for some time that the 3-FASA is the segment of the inhibitor closest to heme bH (18Tokutake N. Miyoshi H. Nakazato H. Iwamura H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1142: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19Kim H. Esser L. Bilayer Hossain M. Xia D. Yu C-A. Rizo J. van der Helm D. Deisenhofer J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 4902-4903Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Funiculosin consists of an N-methyl-substituted 4-hydroxy-2-pyridone ring with a hydrophobic side chain in position 1 and a tetrahydrocyclodropentane ring in position 3. Ilicicolin H is a 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-α-pyridone with a bicyclic decalin system. The 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-α-pyridone is the chromophore of tenellin, produced by the insect-pathogenic fungus Beumeria bassiana. Attached to this is a bicyclic decalin system (20Matsumoto M. Minato H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1976; 42: 3827-3830Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 21Tanabe M. Urano S. Tetrahedron. 1976; 39: 3569-3574Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although the structures of the three antibiotics are clearly different, the structure of ilicicolin H resembles that of antimycin in containing a phenol ring and resembles that of funiculosin because of the pyridone ring system. The similar effects of ilicicolin H and funiculosin on the cytochrome b optical spectrum, shown below, point to a more prominent role of the pyridone ring system in ilicicolin binding. Inhibition of the Yeast and Bovine Cytochrome bc1 Complexes by Ilicicolin H—The results in Fig. 2 compare the inhibition of the yeast cytochrome bc1 complex by ilicicolin H and antimycin. The titration curves in Fig. 2a show the inhibition of ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity by antimycin or ilicicolin H in a catalytic assay using 2.5 nm enzyme concentration. Antimycin inhibits ∼92% of the enzyme activity with a titer very close to one inhibitor per bc1 complex. Ilicicolin H binds less tightly, and concentrations significantly greater than one inhibitor per bc1 complex are required to fully inhibit the enzyme under these assay conditions. The titration curves in Fig. 2b show the inhibition of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase assay using 50 nm enzyme concentration. Under these conditions one equivalent of antimycin per enzyme inhibits ∼99% of the catalytic activity, and the same result is obtained with ilicicolin H. From these results one can estimate that the Ki of ilicicolin H is between 2.5 × 10–9 m and 5 × 10–8 m for the isolated yeast bc1 complex while that for antimycin is <2.5 × 10–9 m. There is a significant hysteresis in the titration curves for both inhibitors in the assay with the higher enzyme concentration. In addition, at low ratios of inhibitor per enzyme both inhibitors cause the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity to increase by 10–20% above the activity in the absence of inhibitor. This rate enhancement is consistently seen in cytochrome c reductase assays when the enzyme concentration is high, as in Fig. 2b, and also occurs but is less evident when the enzyme concentration is low. Although the hysteresis can be attributed to electron transfer between the two monomers in the dimeric bc1 complex, the rate enhancement is more difficult to explain. The rate enhancement is not due to formation of superoxide anion, because it could not be eliminated by including superoxide dismutase in the assay (results not shown). An explanation for the rate enhancement is discussed below. We also compared the inhibition of the bovine bc1 complex by ilicicolin H and antimycin. In the standard catalytic assay with 2.5 nm bc1 complex antimycin inhibits the bovine bc1 complex with stoichiometric affinity as shown in Fig. 3a. With ilicicolin, however, the IC50 for the bovine enzyme is ∼200 nm (Fig. 3b). From this comparison it is clear that ilicicolin H is a much more potent inhibitor of the yeast bc1 complex than of the bovine enzyme. Effect of Ilicicolin H on the Presteady State Reduction of Cytochrome b—In order to determine whether ilicicolin H is a Qn or Qp site inhibitor we characterized the effect of the inhibitor on the presteady state reduction of cytochromes b and c1. When the bc1 complex is reduced by menadiol in the absence of inhibitor, cytochrome b is reduced in a triphasic manner, consisting of a relatively rapid partial reduction, partial reoxidation, and re-reduction (11Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31209-31216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). With 50 μm menadiol the triphasic reduction of cytochrome b is faster, so that the reoxidation phase appears as a lag between the two reduction phases, as shown in Fig. 4a. Antimycin, a Qn site inhibitor, blocks reoxidation of cytochrome b and the re-reduction of b through center N and the triphasic reduction of cytochrome b becomes biphasic, as shown in Fig. 4b. The effects of antimycin on the triphasic reduction have been described in detail elsewhere (11Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31209-31216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Antimycin also slows the rate of cytochrome c1 reduction through center P and the rate matches the slow phase of cytochrome b reduction. As discussed elsewhere, the linkage between the rate of c1 reduction and the slow phase of b reduction is indicative of a concerted mechanism of ubiquinol oxidation (22Snyder C.H. Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13535-13541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Ilicicolin H has the same effects on the presteady state reduction of the bc1 complex as antimycin, changing the triphasic reduction of cytochrome b into a biphasic reaction, and also slowing down cytochrome c1 reduction (Fig. 4c). This suggests that ilicicolin H is also a Qn site inhibitor. Effect of Ilicicolin H on the Presteady State Reduction of the bc1 Complex through Center N—To confirm that ilicicolin H inhibits at the Qn site and to determine the stoichiometry of binding, we titrated ilicicolin into the bc1 complex in the presence of stigmatellin to block reduction through center P and then followed reduction of cytochrome b through center N. As a control we performed the same experiment with antimycin. As can be seen in Fig. 5 both antimycin and ilicicolin H inhibit the reduction of cytochrome b through center N with a stoichiometry of 0.8–1.0 equivalent per bc1 complex. This shows conclusively that ilicicolin H binds to the Qn site of the bc1 complex. The effects of ilicicolin in the presteady state reduction assays show that ilicicolin H acts at the Qn site of the enzyme. To ensure that ilicicolin did not also affect the Qp site we added 2 equivalents of ilicicolin H per bc1 complex in the presence of antimycin and followed the reduction of the enzyme by menadiol. When added together, ilicicolin and antimycin had the same effects on the presteady state reduction of the enzyme as when either inhibitor was added alone. Cytochrome b reduction was biphasic, and cytochrome c1 reduction occurred at a slower rate than when no inhibitor is present (results not shown). If ilicicolin inhibited reduction of the enzyme through the Qp site in addition to its effects at the Qn site, there would have been no reduction of either cytochrome b or cytochrome c1. From this result we conclude that ilicicolin, like antimycin, is specific for the Qn site. Oxidant-induced Reduction of Cytochrome b in the Presence of Ilicicolin H—If the cytochrome bc1 complex is partially reduced and ubiquinol is present, oxidation of cytochrome c1 causes reduction of cytochrome b through center P (23Boyer J.R. Trumpower B.L. FEBS Lett. 1980; 115: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the absence of inhibitors this oxidant-induced reduction of cytochrome b is transient, as the b is rapidly re-oxidized through center N. Antimycin blocks the reoxidation of the b through center N, trapping electrons in the b hemes, and thus promotes the oxidant-induced reduction of cytochrome b. The traces in Fig. 6a show the oxidant-induced reduction of cytochrome b in the presence of antimycin as cytochrome c1 is oxidized by the addition of cytochrome c plus cytochrome c oxidase. Ilicicolin H also promotes oxidant-induced reduction of cytochrome b coincident with cytochrome c1 oxidation, as shown in Fig. 6b. We also observed a similar oxidant-induced reduction of cytochrome b when ilicicolin was added to respiring mitochondrial membranes (results not shown). This result further confirms that ilicicolin acts at the Qn site, like antimycin, and not at the Qp site. Effects of Ilicicolin H on the Absorption Spectrum of Cytochrome b—When antimycin binds to the bc1 complex, it causes a shift to longer wavelengths in the visible absorption spectrum of cytochrome b in the reduced enzyme. This red shift is evident in the α and γ peaks of cytochrome b (24Kamensky Y. Konstantinov A.A Kunz W.S. Surkow S. FEBS Lett. 1985; 181: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The resulting difference spectrum shows a peak at 565 nm and a trough at 559 nm as shown in Fig 7a. By titrating antimycin and measuring this spectral shift it is possible to demonstrate that the inhibitor binds with a stoichiometry of one per enzyme. Ilicicolin H causes a shift toward shorter wavelengths in the spectrum of reduced cytochrome b. As shown in Fig. 7b this blue shift results in a difference spectrum with a peak at 559 nm and a trough at 563 nm. Titration of the spectral shift demonstrates that ilicicolin also binds with a stoichiometry of one per bc1 complex. The effects of ilicicolin H on the presteady state reduction of cytochrome b suggest that ilicicolin H binds at the Qn site, as does antimycin. However, the two inhibitors apparently differ in their mode of binding to the Qn site, since they have different effects on the absorption spectrum of cytochrome b. From the concentrations of inhibitors required to inhibit the bc1 complex (Fig. 2), we estimated that antimycin binds to the Qn site of the yeast enzyme ∼10× more tightly than ilicicolin. If the binding sites for the two inhibitors are identical or overlapping, it should be possible to displace ilicicolin with antimycin. As shown in Fig. 8, a and b, when antimycin is added to the bc1 complex after ilicicolin the blue shift that is induced by ilicicolin is eliminated and replaced by a red shift, indicative of antimycin binding. This result suggests that the more tightly binding antimycin has displaced ilicicolin from the Qn binding site. As a control we performed a similar experiment with stigmatellin, which binds at the Qp site of the bc1 complex. Stigmatellin did not eliminate the blue shift induced by ilicicolin (Fig. 8c). Ilicicolin is an antibiotic that inhibits the cytochrome bc1 complex in a manner similar to antimycin. Ilicicolin blocks oxidation-reduction of cytochrome b through center N of the bc1 complex and promotes oxidant-induced reduction of cytochrome b. These results indicate that ilicicolin binds to the Qn site of the bc1 complex, as does antimycin, and both inhibitors bind with a stoichiometry of one inhibitor per bc1 complex. Although antimycin and ilicicolin both bind to the Qn site, which is near the bH heme, the two inhibitors have different effects on the absorption spectrum of cytochrome b. When antimycin binds to the reduced bc1 complex it has a bathochromic effect, causing a red shift of 1 nm in the α band of the cytochrome b spectrum. When ilicicolin H binds to the yeast bc1 complex it has a hypsochromic effect, causing a blue shift of about 1 nm in the α band of the cytochrome b spectrum. Funiculosin, another Qn inhibitor, also induces a blue shift in the cytochrome b spectrum upon binding to the reduced bc1 complex (2Von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 24Kamensky Y. Konstantinov A.A Kunz W.S. Surkow S. FEBS Lett. 1985; 181: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25Howell N. Robertson D.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11162-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These different effects on the absorption spectrum indicate different effects on the electronic environment of the bH heme. Howell and Robertson (25Howell N. Robertson D.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11162-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) pointed out that the π-π* transitions of the heme result in movement of electrons to the periphery of the heme macrocycle and, along with the heme iron d orbitals, contribute to the α band in the absorption spectrum. Inhibitors can alter the environment near the heme macrocycle. Increasing the electron withdrawing character of the environment around the heme results in a lower energy requirement to excite the electron to a higher orbital, which translates into a red shift in the α band in the optical spectrum. Antimycin apparently has such an effect on the bH heme environment. Inhibitor binding could also result in an increase in the electron donating character of the heme environment, thus producing a blue shift in the α band of the spectrum. Funiculosin and ilicicolin H affect the heme environment in this manner. This may be due to location of the electron-donating pyridone ring in these ligands proximal to the bH heme. Ilicicolin differs markedly from antimycin in efficacy of inhibition of yeast and bovine bc1 complexes. Whereas antimycin inhibits the enzyme from these species with similar efficacy, ilicicolin inhibits the yeast enzyme at much lower concentrations than required to inhibit the bovine enzyme. In ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase assays with 2.5 nm enzyme in the assay, 3–5 nm ilicicolin was required to inhibit the yeast bc1 complex by 50%, while 200–250 nm was required to inhibit the bovine enzyme to the same extent. This difference obviously reflects subtle structural differences in the Qn pocket in the yeast and bovine enzymes. The amino acid residues that are likely responsible for this difference are probably among those amino acids that confer resistance to funiculosin but do not confer cross-resistance to antimycin (26Brasseur G. Sami Saribas A. Daldal F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). A more exact understanding of the structural basis for the species specificity must await a crystal structure of the bc1 complex with ilicicolin bound. We noted a significant hysteresis in the titration curves for inhibition of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity by both antimycin and ilicicolin. We also noted that both inhibitors cause the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity to increase by 10–20% when substoichiometric amounts of inhibitor are added to the enzyme. One would expect hysteresis in the inhibitor titration curves if electrons can cross from one monomer to the other in the dimeric enzyme, in which case binding of inhibitor to only one monomer would not inhibit the enzyme. This would not, however, account for the increase in enzyme activity that is observed with 0.1–0.2 equivalents of inhibitor per enzyme. We suspected that the increased activity might result from formation of superoxide anion induced by low amounts of the inhibitors. We reasoned that superoxide anion might mediate electron transfer from the bc1 complex to cytochrome c faster that cytochrome c could bind and dissociate from the enzyme. However, we were unable to eliminate the rate enhancement in the inhibitor titration curves by including superoxide dismutase in the assays, thus excluding this explanation. We previously showed that inhibitory analogs of ubiquinol bind in an anticooperative manner to the Qp site in the bc1 complex and suggested that the bc1 complex operates by an alternating sites mechanism (15Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1195-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation for the increased activity is that antimycin and ilicicolin disrupt the negative cooperativity between the two monomers in the dimeric enzyme so that ubiquinol can be oxidized at both Qp sites in the dimer simultaneously. If electrons can cross from one monomer to the other in the dimeric enzyme, disruption of negative cooperativity by binding of inhibitor to the Qn site would lead to activity enhancement and hysteresis in inhibitor titration curves as is seen with antimycin and ilicicolin.

We demonstrated previously that atypical PKCι is required for Bcr-Abl-mediated resistance of human K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells to Taxol-induced apoptosis. Here, we report that the pattern of PKC isozyme expression characteristic of CML cells is regulated by Bcr-Abl. When Bcr-Abl was expressed in Bcr-Abl-negative HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells, expression of the PKCβI, PKCβII, and PKCι genes was induced, whereas expression of the PKCδ gene was reduced to levels similar to those found in CML cells. Given the importance of PKCι in Bcr-Abl-mediated transformation, we characterized the mechanism by which Bcr-Abl regulates PKCι expression. A 1200-bp PKCι promoter construct isolated from genomic DNA was highly active in Bcr-Abl-positive K562 cells and was activated when Bcr-Abl-negative cells were transfected with Bcr-Abl. Bcr-Abl-mediated induction of the PKCι promoter was dependent upon MEK1/2 activity, but not phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or p38 MAPK activity. Mutational analysis of the PKCι promoter revealed a region between 97 and 114 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site that is responsible for Bcr-Abl-mediated regulation. Mutation of a consensus Elk1-binding site within this region abolished Bcr-Abl-mediated regulation. We conclude that Bcr-Abl regulates PKCι expression through the MEK-dependent activation of an Elk1 element within the proximal PKCι promoter.

Specific changes in PKC isozyme expression accompany carcinogenesis in many cancers, including those of the brain, lung, prostate, stomach, skin, breast, liver, small intestine, and colon (reviewed in Ref. 1Fields A.P. Gustafson W.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 233: 519-537PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that changes in PKC isozyme expression contribute to the process of cellular transformation by inducing changes in cellular proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival. Despite the importance of PKC isozyme regulation in cellular transformation, the transcriptional or translational regulation of PKC isozyme expression has not been well studied in the context of carcinogenesis. Although promoters for several PKC isozymes have been cloned from human and mouse sources (2Clark J.H. Haridasse V. Glazer R.I.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) results from translocation of the abl tyrosine kinase gene from the long arm of chromosome 9 to the breakpoint cluster region of chromosome 22, the Philadelphia chromosome (7Rowley J.D. Nature. 1973; 243: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (3403) Google Scholar). This translocation results in the production of a constitutively active tyrosine kinase fusion gene product, bcr-abl (8Lugo T.G. Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Witte O.N. Science. 1990; 247: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). The Philadelphia chromosome is present in 95% of patients with CML, a myeloproliferative disorder that results from the transformation and expansion of a single multipotent hematopoietic stem cell (9Kurzrock R. Gutterman J.U. Talpaz M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 319: 990-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). bcr-abl has been shown to be the sole transforming oncogene in animal models of CML (10Daley G.Q. Van Etten R.A. Baltimore D.

Multiple breakpoints in the bcr gene result in several forms of bcr-abl. The most common form of bcr-abl in CML is the 210-kDa p210bcr-abl gene (9Kurzrock R. Gutterman J.U. Talpaz M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 319: 990-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). A less common form results when there is a truncated bcr region: 185-kDa p185bcr-abl. p185bcr-abl is also transforming and is present in 25% of patients with acute lymphoid leukemia (9Kurzrock R.

Tyrosine kinase activity is necessary for transformation by Bcr-Abl, and a hallmark of Bcr-Abl transformation is extreme resistance to chemotherapeutic agent-induced apoptosis (8Lugo T.G.

Our group has demonstrated previously that several PKC isozymes are important in the biology of human K562 CML cells (27Jamieson L. Carpenter L. Biden T.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol.

We have shown that PKCβII is required for CML cell proliferation, whereas PKCι is necessary for Bcr-Abl-mediated resistance to antineoplastic drug-induced apoptosis (27Jamieson L. Carpenter L. Biden T.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3927-3930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 29Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27521-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We have also shown that PKCι is a critical regulator of the NF-κB pathway and that NF-κB activity is necessary for the anti-apoptotic effect of Bcr-Abl (28Lu Y. Jamieson L. Brasier A.R. Fields A.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4777-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). PKCβII appears to function downstream of Bcr-Abl and is necessary for Bcr-Abl-dependent phosphorylation of the proto-oncogene FUS (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein-1) (31Perrotti D. Iervolino A. Cesi V. Cirinna M. Lombardini S. Grassilli E. Bonatti S. Claudio P.P. Calabretta B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6159-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation prevents proteolysis of the FUS protein, which is thought to mediate Bcr-Abl-dependent proliferation and lack of differentiation (31Perrotti D. Iervolino A. Cesi V. Cirinna M. Lombardini S. Grassilli E. Bonatti S. Claudio P.P. Calabretta B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6159-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because of the strong link between specific PKC isozymes and Bcr-Abl-mediated transformation, we profiled the expression of PKC isozymes as a consequence of expression of Bcr-Abl using Affymetrix gene arrays. We found that Bcr-Abl regulates expression of multiple PKC isozymes implicated in Bcr-Abl-mediated transformation, including PKCβII and PKCι. We demonstrate that Bcr-Abl regulates PKCι expression through MEK-dependent activation of a consensus Elk1 element within the proximal promoter of the PKCι gene. Cell Culture, Drug Treatments, and Antibodies—Human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells and K562 CML cells were maintained in suspension culture in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. HL-60 cells stably transfected with either neomycin (HL-60/Neo) or p210bcr-abl (HL-60/bcr-abl) were obtained from Dr. K. Bhalla (Emory University Medical School). HL-60 cell transfectants were maintained in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium and 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418 sulfate (Geneticin liquid, Invitrogen). Human HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, minimum essential medium nonessential amino acid solution (Sigma), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 2 mml-glutamine. Human HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. All cultures were supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The MEK and p38 kinase inhibitors (U0126, SB202474, SB202190, and SB203580) and the PI 3-kinase inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002) were obtained from Calbiochem, dissolved in Me2SO, and added directly to the culture media at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Apoptosis was assessed by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining for apoptotic bodies as described previously (27Jamieson L. Carpenter L. Biden T.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3927-3930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 30Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27521-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Protein expression was assessed by immunoblot analysis as described previously (27Jamieson L. Carpenter L. Biden T.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3927-3930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) using antibodies to Bcr-Abl, PKCβI, PKCβII, and actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); PKCδ (Invitrogen); and PKCι (Transduction Laboratories). High Density Oligonucleotide Array Analysis—RNA samples from HL-60/Neo and HL-60/bcr-abl cells were hybridized to Hu95A GeneChips (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) containing 12,626 sequenced genes essentially as we described previously (32Yu W. Murray N.R. Weems C. Chen L. Guo H. Ethridge R. Ceci J.D. Evers B.M. Thompson E.A. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11167-11174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). GeneChip arrays were scanned using a gene array scanner (Hewlett-Packard Co.) and analyzed using GeneChip Analysis Suite 4 software (Affymetrix, Inc.). Real-time Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction Analysis of Gene Expression—Real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR was conducted using TaqMan technology on an Applied Biosystems 7000 sequence detection system. A 20× assay mixture of primers and TaqMan minor grove binder (MGB) probes (6-phosphoramidite 6-FAM™ dye-labeled) was used for each target gene and the endogenous control, human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Primers were designed to span exon-exon junctions so as not to detect genomic DNA. The primer and probe sequences were as follows. Human PKCι probe, CCTTCCTTACACATGCC; forward primer, GAAGGCCACATTAAACTCACTGACTAC; and reverse primer, GGTTGTATCTCCTGGCCGTAAT. Human PKCβI probe, TCTTGTCTCTAGCTTTTG; forward primer, AAACTTGAACGCAAAGAGATCCA; and reverse primer, CTGTCTGGTGAACTCTTTGTCGAA. Human PKCβII probe, TCGCCCACAAGCT; forward primer, AAACTTGAACGCAAAGAGATCCA; and reverse primer, ATCGGTCGAAGTTTTCAGCATT. Human PKCδ probe, CCCACTGTTGTCTTGC; forward primer, TTCGAGAAGAAGACCGGAGTTG; and reverse primer, CTCCCAGATCTTGCCGTAGGT. Primer sequences were searched against the Celera Database to confirm specificity. The method was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems) and has been described previously (32Yu W. Murray N.R. Weems C. Chen L. Guo H. Ethridge R. Ceci J.D. Evers B.M. Thompson E.A. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11167-11174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Plasmids and Constructs—The p210bcr-abl, p185bcr-abl, and p185kd-bcr-abl (where kd is kinase-dead) expression plasmids were constructed by excision of the Bcr-Abl coding regions from pEXV retroviral expression vectors using non-directional cloning via an EcoRI site (a gift from Dr. A. M. Pendergast, Duke University) and ligation into either pCMV-Tag2b (p210bcr-abl; Stratagene) or pCMV-Script (p185bcr-abl and p185kd-bcr-abl) for transient expression in mammalian cells. Human genomic P1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) clones for PKCι promoter cloning were obtained from Genome Systems Inc. using the 5′-most 500 bp of the PKCι coding sequence as a probe for PAC clone selection. All genomic PKCι promoter constructs were amplified by PCR directly from the genomic PAC clone and cloned by TOPO-TA cloning (Invitrogen) into the pCR2.5 vector. Each 5′-primer contained a 5′-XhoI site, and each 3′-PCR primer contained a 3′-HindIII restriction site to facilitate subsequent cloning. A two-step PCR procedure was used to generate site-directed mutants. Briefly, 5′- and 3′-overlapping regions were amplified from the original PAC clone, melted, mixed, and then re-amplified to produce a full-length, mutated, finished product, which was subsequently cloned into TOPO-TA as described above. The promoter constructs were directionally cloned into the pGL3 reporter plasmid (Promega). The Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid pRLSV40 (Promega) was used as an internal control. All plasmids were purified by ion-exchange chromatography (QIAGEN Inc.), resolved by agarose electrophoresis, and confirmed by sequencing. All constructs used the reverse primer sequence 5′-CGGCTCCTCCCACTGCCCGT-3′. The forward primer sequences were as follows: -1200, TCGCCCAGGCTGGAGTGCAG; -166, GTTCAGCCCGGTATTGAGGC; -141, GAGCTATGACTTAGGTTGCG; -97, CTTTGGAGCGAGCGAAGTGG; 141Mut1, GAGCTATGACTTAGGTTGCGCCCGCCCTA; 141Mut2, GAGCTGGCTGGATGGTTGCGATGCTTATACCCCGGAATGTGGG; 141Mut3, GAGCTGGCTGGATGGTTGCGCCCGCCCTAACATCTAATGTGGGCCTTTG; 166Mut1, ACCGTCCCCGGTATTGAGGCTCCTTG; and 166Mut2, GTTCAGCCCGGTATTGTCATGACTTGAGCTGGCTGGATGGTTG. For two-step PCR, the external forward primer was the -166 primer above. The internal primers were as follows: 166Mut3, GCCCACATGAGACATCAGGGCGGGCGCAACCATCCA (internal reverse) and CCGCCCTGATGTCTCATGTGGGCCTTTGGAGCGAGCGAAGTGG (internal forward); 166Mut4, AAAGGCCATGTCGAGACGGTAGGGCGGGCGCAACCATCC (internal reverse) and CTACCGTCTCGACATGGCCTTTGGAGCGAGCGAAGTGG (internal forward); and 166Δ-Elk, CTTCGCTCGCTCCAAAGGCCGGGCGGGCGCAACCA (internal reverse) and TGGTTGCGCCCGCCCGGCCTTTGGAGCGAG (internal forward). Transfections and Luciferase Reporter Assays—Transient transfections were carried out using the LipofectAMINE Plus transfection reagent (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer with minor modifications. Suspension cultures of K562 cells in log-phase growth were plated in 200 μl of serum-free medium (5 × 105 cells)/well of a 24-well plate for transfection. Adherent cultures (HEK293 and HepG2 cells) were plated to 70% confluence 24 h prior to transfection, and the growth medium was replaced with serum-free medium immediately before transfection. Transfections were carried out in triplicate using pGL3 reporter plasmid DNA containing PKCι promoter constructs at 0.2 μg/well. In some cases, Bcr-Abl reporter or empty vector DNA at 0.2 μg/well was included in the transfection mixture. All transfections contained the control Renilla pRLSV40 plasmid at 25 ng/well as an internal control. Cellular protein was isolated in 100 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega) 24 or 48 h after transfection as indicated in the figure legends. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured in 10 μl of cell lysate using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) on a Monolight 2010 luminometer. Expression of Bcr-Abl in HL-60 Cells Confers Chemoresistance to Taxol—HL-60 cells are promyelocytic leukemia cells that lack the 9:22 chromosomal translocation that results in expression of the Bcr-Abl fusion protein. We demonstrated previously that parental HL-60 cells are sensitive to Taxol-induced apoptosis (27Jamieson L. Carpenter L. Biden T.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3927-3930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast, K562 cells express Bcr-Abl and are highly resistant to Taxol-induced apoptosis (27Jamieson L. Carpenter L. Biden T.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3927-3930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We utilized HL-60 cells that have been stably transfected with either a control neomycin resistance plasmid (HL-60/Neo cells) or the bcr-abl oncogene (HL-60/bcr-abl cells) (33Amarante-Mendes G.P. Naekyung Kim C. Liu L. Huang Y. Perkins C.L. Green D.R. Bhalla K. Blood. 1998; 91: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to assess whether Bcr-Abl induces a Taxol-resistant phenotype in HL-60 cells. HL-60/bcr-abl, HL-60/Neo, and K562 cells were treated with 100 nm Taxol for 24 h, and apoptosis was measured by the presence of apoptotic bodies in 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained cells (Fig. 1A) as described previously (27Jamieson L. Carpenter L. Biden T.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3927-3930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As expected, HL-60/Neo cells were highly sensitive to Taxol and rapidly underwent apoptosis in response to Taxol. In contrast, HL-60/bcr-abl cells were highly resistant to Taxol-induced apoptosis and, much like K562 cells, underwent mitotic arrest (but not apoptosis) when treated with Taxol. Therefore, Bcr-Abl confers resistance to Taxol-induced apoptosis when expressed in HL-60 cells, consistent with the original characterization of HL-60/bcr-abl cells (33Amarante-Mendes G.P. Naekyung Kim C. Liu L. Huang Y. Perkins C.L. Green D.R. Bhalla K. Blood. 1998; 91: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bcr-Abl Induces Changes in PKC Isozyme Gene Expression—We demonstrated previously the importance of multiple PKC isozymes in Bcr-Abl-mediated transformation, including resistance to Taxol-induced apoptosis (27Jamieson L. Carpenter L. Biden T.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3927-3930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 30Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27521-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined the effect of Bcr-Abl expression on PKC isozyme expression in HL-60/bcr-abl cells by GeneChip microarray analysis (Fig. 1B). Our analysis revealed a significant increase in expression of the PKCβI, PKCβII, and PKCι genes and a significant decrease in expression of the PKCδ gene in HL-60/bcr-abl cells compared with HL-60/Neo cells. In contrast, expression of the PKC∈, PKCη, PKCγ, PKCμ, PKCθ, and PKCζ genes was not significantly changed in HL-60/bcr-abl cells compared with HL-60/Neo cells. We confirmed the changes in expression of PKCβI, PKCβII, PKCδ, and PKCι by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (Fig. 2). Expression of the mRNA for each PKC isozyme was measured in K562 cells (Fig. 2A), HL-60/Neo cells (Fig. 2B), and HL-60/bcr-abl cells (Fig. 2C) and, in each case, normalized to PKCι mRNA levels. K562 and HL-60/bcr-abl cells exhibited a strikingly similar pattern of PKC expression characterized by relatively high PKCι, PKCβI, and PKCβII levels and low PKCδ levels. In contrast, Bcr-Abl-negative HL-60/Neo cells exhibited a distinct pattern characterized by relatively low PKCι, PKCβI, and PKCβII levels and high PKCδ levels. To compare PKC isozyme levels in all three cell lines, the level of each isozyme is expressed relative to the level of that isozyme in K562 cells (Fig. 2D). This analysis demonstrated a dramatic increase in the levels of PKCβI, PKCβII, and PKCι mRNAs and a decrease in the levels of PKCδ mRNA in both K562 and HL-60/bcr-abl cells compared with HL-60/Neo cells. These data are consistent with our microarray data and confirm the changes in expression of PKC isozymes by Bcr-Abl. Furthermore, they demonstrate that expression of Bcr-Abl induces a pattern of PKC isozyme expression strikingly similar to that in K562 CML cells. We next confirmed that the changes in PKC isozyme mRNA expression induced by Bcr-Abl result in concordant changes in PKC isozyme protein levels. For this purpose, we assessed the levels of PKCβI, PKCβII, PKCδ, and PKCι in HL-60/Neo, HL-60/bcr-abl, and K562 cells by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3). In each case, the level of PKC isozyme protein expression was consistent with the observed change in the mRNA level for that isozyme as demonstrated by microarray and real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis, demonstrating the similarities in PKC isozyme expression in K562 CML cells and HL-60 cells engineered to express Bcr-Abl. Bcr-Abl Regulates PKCι Gene Promoter Activity—We demonstrated previously a requisite role for PKCι in Bcr-Abl-mediated resistance to apoptosis (27Jamieson L. Carpenter L. Biden T.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3927-3930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 30Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27521-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Therefore, we focused our attention on the regulation of PKCι transcription by Bcr-Abl. We began our analysis by cloning and characterizing the upstream regulatory promoter region of the PKCι gene. Two human PAC clones were isolated based on hybridization to a probe consisting of the 5′-most end of the PKCι mRNA sequence (Genome Systems Inc.). Comparison of the PKCι mRNA 5′-probe used for the PAC clone isolation with the NCBI published draft of the human genome using the BLAST algorithm revealed a large (>14 kb) region of known genomic sequence upstream of the PKCι coding region. PCR primers complementary to the genomic PKCι DNA sequence were used to clone two PAC fragments encompassing 3929 and 1200 bp immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site of the PKCι gene. These two clones were inserted into the pGL3 reporter plasmid upstream of a luciferase reporter gene and assessed for promoter activity. The 1200-bp promoter construct contains promoter activity that is approximately three times greater compared with a control SV40 promoter construct when transfected into K562 cells (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, both the 3929- and 1200-bp PKCι promoter constructs were highly activated by Bcr-Abl (∼5-fold) when cotransfected with a mammalian expression plasmid containing FLAG-tagged p210bcr-abl for 48 h into the Bcr-Abl-negative cell line, HepG2 (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained when Bcr-Abl and the PKCι promoter constructs were cotransfected into HEK293 cells, indicating that Bcr-Abl-mediated activation of the PKCι promoter is not specific to HepG2 cells (data not shown). Thus, the 1200-bp PKCι promoter construct exhibits promoter activity and contains elements responsible for p210bcr-abl-mediated promoter activation. We next assessed whether the 1200-bp PKCι promoter construct is also activated by the p185 variant of the bcr-abl oncogene and whether activation of the promoter requires tyrosine kinase activity of Bcr-Abl. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with the 1200-bp PKCι promoter construct and a mammalian expression plasmid (pCMV) containing p210bcr-abl, p185bcr-abl, or a kinase-deficient p185bcr-abl mutant (p185kd-bcr-abl) (Fig. 4C). A similar level of promoter activation was observed in the presence of either p210bcr-abl or p185bcr-abl, whereas p185kd-bcr-abl was unable to activate the 1200-bp PKCι promoter construct. Immunoblot analysis using an antibody against the Abl region common to p210bcr-abl, p185bcr-abl, and p185kd-bcr-abl demonstrated that similar levels of the three Bcr-Abl proteins were expressed in the cells used in these experiments (data not shown). These data demonstrate that both p210bcr-abl and p185bcr-abl can activate the PKCι promoter and that promoter activation is dependent upon Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity. Bcr-Abl-mediated PKCι Promoter Activity Is MEK-dependent—Bcr-Abl mediates its cellular effects through activation of several major signaling pathways. We employed selective chemical inhibitors of specific signaling components to determine which pathway(s) is involved in Bcr-Abl-mediated activation of the PKCι promoter (Fig. 5). Cotransfection of p"

In contrast, ATP is a potent full agonist at the rP2Y4 receptor but is a similarly potent competitive antagonist at the hP2Y4 receptor. To delineate the structural determinants of agonism versus antagonism in these species homologues, we expressed a series of human/rat P2Y4 receptor chimeras in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells and assessed the capacity of ATP and UTP to mobilize intracellular Ca2+. Replacement of the NH2 terminus of the hP2Y4 receptor with the corresponding region of the rP2Y4 receptor resulted in a receptor that was activated weakly by ATP, whereas replacement of the second extracellular loop (EL2) of the hP2Y4 receptor with that of the rP2Y4 receptor yielded a chimeric receptor that was activated fully by UTP and near fully by ATP, albeit with lower potencies than those observed at the rP2Y4 receptor. These potencies were increased, and ATP was converted to a full agonist by replacing both the NH2 terminus and EL2 in the hP2Y4 receptor with the corresponding regions from the rP2Y4 receptor. Mutational analysis of the five divergent amino acids in EL2 between the two receptors revealed that three amino acids, Asn-177, Ile-183, and Leu-190, contribute to the capacity of EL2 to impart ATP agonism. Taken together, these results suggest that the second extracellular loop and the NH2 terminus form a functional motif that plays a key role in determining whether ATP functions as an agonist or antagonist at mammalian P2Y4 receptors.

In addition to coupling to phospholipase C, the hP2Y11 receptor also couples to Gs to activate adenylyl cyclase and promotes cyclic AMP accumulation (5Communi D. Govaerts C. Parmentier M.

The recently identified P2Y12, P2Y13, and P2Y14 receptors, which are encoded on a short segment of chromosome 3, have high sequence identity with each other (40–48%) but share relatively little sequence identity (22–25%) with the other hP2Y receptors. The P2Y12 receptor has been shown to be the Gi-coupled receptor in platelets that, together with the P2Y1 receptor, mediate ADP-promoted platelet aggregation (8Hollopeter G. Jantzen H.M. Vincent D.

Differences in nucleotide selectivity have been observed between species orthologues of P2Y receptors. For example, the avian p2y3 and rat P2Y6 receptor are species homologues with ∼65% identity that differ in their capacity to mediate adenine nucleotide-promoted inositol phosphate accumulation (14Li Q. Olesky M. Palmer R.K. Harden T.K. Nicholas R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Whereas UDP and UTP have similar potencies at the two receptors, ADP and ATP are considerably more potent and efficacious at the avian p2y3 receptor than at the rat P2Y6 receptor. Human and canine P2Y11 receptors, which share ∼70% amino acid identity (15Zambon A.C. Brunton L.L. Barrett K.E. Hughes R.J. Torres B. Insel P.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), also differ in their ability to be activated by adenine nucleotides. ATP nucleotides are more potent and efficacious than their corresponding diphosphate nucleotides at the human P2Y11 receptor for promotion of both inositol phosphate and cAMP accumulation, whereas ADP nucleotides are considerably more potent than their corresponding triphosphates at the canine P2Y11 receptor (16Qi A.D. Zambon A.C. Insel P.A. Nicholas R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1375-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We have also observed a remarkable difference in the nucleotide selectivities and agonism versus antagonism between rat and human P2Y4 receptors, which exhibit 83% sequence identity (17Kennedy C. Qi A.D. Herold C.L. Harden T.K. Nicholas R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 926-931PubMed Google Scholar). Under conditions that minimized confounding factors such as nucleotide metabolism, bioconversion, and endogenous nucleotide release, UTP, ATP, diadenosine tetraphosphate, ITP, GTP, CTP, and XTP were all full agonists at the rP2Y4 receptor, whereas only UTP, GTP, and ITP activated the hP2Y4 receptor. Moreover, whereas ATP acted as a potent, full agonist at the rP2Y4 receptor, it was a similarly potent competitive antagonist at the hP2Y4 receptor. The capacity of ATP to bind with relatively high affinity to both species homologues of the P2Y4 receptor, but to act as an agonist at one receptor and an antagonist at the other, provides an ideal signaling system to pursue the structural basis of agonism versus antagonism. A series of hP2Y4/rP2Y4 receptor chimeras was constructed, and we report here that the second extracellular loop (EL2) of the P2Y4 receptor is a major determinant of agonist versus antagonist activity of ATP, whereas the NH2 terminus plays a lesser role. Moreover, 3 amino acids from EL2 of the hP2Y4 receptor, when replaced with the corresponding residues from the rP2Y4 receptor, are sufficient to convert ATP from an antagonist to nearly a full agonist at the hP2Y4 receptor. These studies implicate the EL2 of the P2Y4 receptor, and possibly other P2Y receptors, as a major mediator of receptor activation. Materials—All tissue culture reagents and Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) were supplied by either Mediatech, Inc. (Herndon, VA) or the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center tissue culture facility (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). ATP and UTP (AP Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) were at least 99% pure and contained no other contaminating nucleotides. Fura-2/AM was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Polybrene and sodium butyrate were from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO). Mouse HA.11 monoclonal antibody was from BAbCO (Richmond, CA). [125I]Rabbit anti-mouse IgG (0.1 μCi/ml) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Pfu polymerase was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Site-directed Mutagenesis and Construction of Chimeric Receptors— hP2Y4/rP2Y4 chimeras and receptors harboring point mutations were generated by four primer PCR (18Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). PCR amplification with overlapping primers was carried out with Pfu DNA polymerase from 1 ng of template. The amplification conditions were: 94 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 75 s; and a final extension for 7 min at 72 °C. To generate chimera 1/EL2, chimera 1 DNA was used as a template along with specific primer pairs. Chimeric and mutant receptor DNA constructs created as described above were digested with EcoRI and XhoI and ligated into similarly digested pLXSN vector (19Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7 (984–986, 989): 980-982PubMed Google Scholar). Receptors harboring the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag at their NH2 termini were constructed by amplifying the coding sequence of receptors with an upstream primer containing an MluI site just preceding the second codon. The amplified fragments were digested with MluI and XhoI and used to replace the coding sequence of the human P2Y1 receptor in the plasmid pLXSN-HA-hP2Y1, which contained 15 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence, the initiating ATG codon, and the HA tag sequence followed by an MluI site at the start of the human P2Y1 receptor coding sequence. Addition of an HA tag at the NH2 terminus of a G protein-coupled receptor has been shown to have no effect on its pharmacological selectivity (20Schachter J.B. Boyer J.L. Li Q. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 1021-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

Expression of Receptors in 1321N1 Human Astrocytoma Cells—Receptors were expressed in 1321N1 cells by using the retroviral expression system described by Comstock et al. (22Comstock K.E. Watson N.F. Olsen J.C. Tuan R. Methods in Molecular Biology: Recombinant Gene Expression Protocols. 62. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 207-222Google Scholar). Briefly, pLXSN retroviral plasmids containing the appropriate receptor sequence were transfected into the murine packaging cell line PA317 by calcium phosphate precipitation. Following a 2-day incubation at 32 °C in the presence of 5 mm sodium butyrate, the virus-containing medium was collected, filtered, and incubated with 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells for 2 h in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene. Infected 1321N1 cells were selected for Geneticin resistance for 10–14 days in the presence of 1 mg/ml G-418. Cell Culture—PA317 cells were grown in DMEM-H, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. 1321N1 cells stably expressing receptors were grown in DMEM-H, 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.4 mg/ml G-418, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. Cells were grown in monolayer and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. Intracellular [Ca2+] Measurements—Intracellular [Ca2+] was determined as described previously (16Qi A.D. Zambon A.C. Insel P.A. Nicholas R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1375-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Kennedy C. Qi A.D. Herold C.L. Harden T.K. Nicholas R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 926-931PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on 22-mm glass coverslips to ∼20% confluence and then were loaded with 750 nm Fura-2/AM for 30 min. Coverslips were encased in a Plexiglas flowthrough chamber (0.2-ml volume) and continuously superfused at ∼1.4 ml/min with buffer (HBSS plus Ca2+/Mg2+) with or without ligands. The chamber was secured to the stage of a Nikon inverted fluorescence microscope, and data were recorded and processed with an InCyt Im2 imaging system (Intracellular Imaging Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Ligands were applied for 30 s, and intracellular [Ca2+] was monitored in 6–15 individual cells per coverslip. A small number of unresponsive cells that were not activated by a maximal dose of UTP (100–300 μm) were not included for analysis. To generate concentration-response curves, each concentration of nucleotide was applied only once to each coverslip to avoid receptor desensitization, and the area under the curve (AUC) was determined by using National Institutes of Health Image software. The values from at least three coverslips were averaged and plotted as a function of nucleotide concentration. Radioimmunoassay—Cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/well 3 days prior to assay. Cells were fixed with 0.2 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, washed twice with 1 ml of HBSS plus Ca2+/Mg2+, and blocked for 30 min at room temperature with 0.2 ml of DMEM-H plus 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were incubated with mouse HA.11 monoclonal antibody at a 1:1000 dilution in 0.2 ml of medium for 1 h at room temperature. Following two washes with 1 ml of HBSS plus Ca2+/Mg2+, cells were incubated with [125I]rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody diluted to 1:500 in 0.2 ml of medium for 2 h at room temperature. Following another series of washing steps, cells were solubilized in 0.4 ml of 1 m NaOH overnight and transferred to glass tubes for quantitation in a gamma counter. Data Analysis and Statistics—EC50 values and 95% confidence limits for EC50 values were calculated by non-linear regression with Graph-Pad Prism 3.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Data were compared using one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's post-test comparison, with p < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant. Construction of Chimeric hP2Y4 and rP2Y4 Receptors—We previously reported that ATP is a potent full agonist at the rP2Y4 but is a similarly potent competitive antagonist at the hP2Y4 (17Kennedy C. Qi A.D. Herold C.L. Harden T.K. Nicholas R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 926-931PubMed Google Scholar). To ascertain the structural basis for this difference in agonism versus antagonism, we generated a series of chimeric receptors between these similar species orthologues (83% identity; see Fig. 1A). As illustrated in Fig. 1B, these chimeras were constructed by systematic replacement of small regions of the hP2Y4 with the corresponding regions from the rP2Y4 receptor. The replacements were made in the hP2Y4 receptor so we could identify one or more domains from the rP2Y4 receptor that conferred a change of ATP from a potent antagonist to a potent agonist when inserted into the hP2Y4 receptor. Thus, these experiments were designed to identify a “gain of function” by analyzing the responsiveness of the chimeric receptors to ATP. The receptors were stably expressed in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells, which do not exhibit functional responses to extracellular nucleotides (23Schachter J.B. Li Q. Boyer J.L. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and nucleotide-promoted intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was quantitated under conditions that minimized the potential confounding effects of nucleotide metabolism, bioconversion, and accumulation of released nucleotides (17Kennedy C. Qi A.D. Herold C.L. Harden T.K. Nicholas R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 926-931PubMed Google Scholar). As previously studied in detail (17Kennedy C. Qi A.D. Herold C.L. Harden T.K. Nicholas R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 926-931PubMed Google Scholar), 100 μm ATP failed to activate the hP2Y4 receptor, whereas application of 100 μm UTP to hP2Y4-1321N1 cells induced a rapid, reversible rise in intracellular Ca2+ levels (Fig. 2A, right panel). This profile was clearly different from that of the rP2Y4 receptor, which displayed robust responses to both ATP and UTP (Fig. 2B, right panel). The lower apparent maximum effect of UTP compared with ATP illustrated in the right panel in Fig. 2B was due to desensitization of the rP2Y4, because the maximum increase in intracellular [Ca2+] evoked by a single application of 100 μm ATP or UTP applied to separate coverslips was identical (Fig. 2B, left panel and data not shown). Concentration-response curves for nucleotides were generated by integrating the area under the curve (AUC) of the Ca2+ response averaged from 6–15 cells on a coverslip, with at least three coverslips assayed for each concentration. To avoid concerns about desensitization, each coverslip was exposed only once to a single nucleotide concentration. AUC values for each agonist concentration reflect both the time and magnitude of the Ca2+ mobilization response and the number of responding cells in the imaging field. UTP increased intracellular Ca2+ levels in 1321N1-hP2Y4 cells with an EC50 of 530 ± 220 nm, whereas ATP was without agonist effect at all concentrations tested (Fig. 2A, left panel, and Table I). Moreover, ATP competitively antagonized the stimulatory effects of UTP at the hP2Y4 with a Kb value (antagonist dissociation constant) of 700 nm that is very similar to the potency of UTP for activation (Ref. 17Kennedy C. Qi A.D. Herold C.L. Harden T.K. Nicholas R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 926-931PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). In contrast, both UTP and ATP promoted intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in 1321N1-rP2Y4 cells with EC50 values of 600 ± 220 and 890 ± 460 nm, respectively (Fig. 2B, left panel, and Table I). Thus, UTP activated both the hP2Y4 and rP2Y4 receptor with comparable potencies, whereas ATP was a full agonist at the rP2Y4 receptor and an antagonist at the hP2Y4 receptor.Table IPotencies of UTP and ATP for mobilization of intracellular [Ca2+] at the various P2Y4 receptors described in this study Dose-response curves were generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” EC50 values (μm) are presented as mean values ± S.D. for wild type hP2Y4 and rP2Y4 receptors (n ≥ 5) or as values (95% confidence intervals) calculated by nonlinear regression for all of the chimeric and mutant receptors.ReceptorUTPATPhP2Y40.53 ± 0.22 (n = 5)NEaNE, no effect (n = 7)rP2Y40.60 ± 0.22 (n = 6)0.89 ± 0.46 (n = 7)Chimera 11.5 (0.64—3.3)NDbND, not determined; the response to ATP did not reach maximum at the highest concentration tested (300 μm)Chimera 21.0 (0.47—2.2)NEChimera 30.66 (0.17—2.5)NEChimera 413 (3.1—54)95 (28—320)Chimera 50.9 (0.3—2.7)NEChimera 60.55 (0.16—3.5)NEChimera 70.80 (0.22—2.9)NEChimera 4A1.3 (0.58—2.9)NEChimera 4/EL26.0 (3.4—11)51 (19—140)Chimera 1/EL21.9 (0.50—7.2)12 (2.4—58)hP2Y4 S177N1.0 (0.38—2.7)NDhP2Y4 N178A1.0 (0.40—2.6)NEhP2Y4 K179N0.50 (0.20—1.2)NEhP2Y4 V183I0.69 (0.24—2.0)NDhP2Y4 R190L0.45 (0.25—0.81)NDTriple mutant5.6 (2.1—16)48 (7.2—320)a NE, no effectb ND, not determined; the response to ATP did not reach maximum at the highest concentration tested (300 μm) Open table in a new tab Characterization of the hP2Y4/rP2Y4 Receptor Chimeras— Each of the seven first-generation chimeras (Fig. 1B) was fully functional when expressed in 1321N1 cells, with UTP promoting robust intracellular Ca2+ mobilization responses (Fig. 3 and Table I). The EC50 values for UTP ranged from 0.55 to 13 μm for the various constructs (Table I). However, marked differences in the response to ATP were observed among the chimeras. Similar to the hP2Y4 receptor, no responses to 100 μm ATP were observed in 1321N1 cells expressing chimeras 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7 (Fig. 3B and data not shown). A weak but reproducible response to ATP was observed with chimera 1 (Fig. 3A). However, a nearly full agonist response to ATP was observed in cells expressing chimera 4, which contained the second intracellular loop (IL2), transmembrane 4 (TM4), and the second extracellular loop (EL2) of the rP2Y4 receptor (Fig. 3C). The EC50 values of UTP and ATP at chimera 4 were 13 and 95 μm, respectively (Table I). The reason(s) for the shift to the right of the agonist activation curves in chimera 4 but not in the other chimeras has not been fully pursued, but it is unlikely that it is due to differences in receptor expression at the cell surface (as discussed below). These data demonstrate that the region encompassing the second intracellular loop and second extracellular loop of the hP2Y4 and rP2Y4 receptors is a uniquely important determinant of ATP agonism at the P2Y4 receptor. Roles of IL2, TM4, and EL2 from the rat P2Y4 Receptor in Imparting ATP Agonist Activity to the Human P2Y4 Receptor— The results with chimera 4 suggested the existence of identifiable sequence in the P2Y4 receptor responsible for agonist versus antagonist action of ATP. Thus, we generated two additional chimeras, in which IL2 and TM4 (chimera 4A) or EL2 (chimera 4/EL2) of the hP2Y4 receptor were replaced individually with their cognate sequences from the rP2Y4 receptor (see Fig. 1A). As was observed with chimeras 1–7, UTP was a potent agonist at these chimeric P2Y4 receptors (Fig. 4 and Table I). Replacement of IL2 and TM4 of the hP2Y4 receptor with the corresponding region from the rP2Y4 receptor failed to alter the phenotype of the hP2Y4 receptor (Fig. 4A), whereas replacement of EL2 of the hP2Y4 receptor with the corresponding domain from the rP2Y4 receptor resulted in a near full agonist response to ATP (Fig 4B). Moreover, the agonist profile of chimera 4/EL2 was essentially identical to that of chimera 4 (Table I). These data indicate that EL2 specifies the ability of ATP to act as an agonist or antagonist at the P2Y4 receptor. As illustrated earlier, replacement of the hP2Y4 receptor NH2 terminus with the corresponding sequence from the rP2Y4 receptor (chimera 1) resulted in a receptor that was activated, albeit weakly, by 100 μm ATP (Fig. 3A). Therefore, we constructed an additional chimera of the hP2Y4 receptor (chimera 1/EL2), in which both the NH2 terminus and EL2 of the hP2Y4 receptor were replaced by the cognate regions from the rP2Y4 receptor, with the goal of generating a P2Y4 receptor exhibiting potencies for UTP and ATP more closely resembling those of the wild type rP2Y4 receptor. Indeed, the EC50 values of UTP and ATP for promotion of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization at chimera 1/EL2 were 1.9 and 12 μm, respectively (Fig. 4C and Table I). Moreover, ATP became an apparent full agonist at chimera 1/EL2, compared with the partial agonism of ATP in chimera 4/EL2 (Fig. 4, compare B with C). Thus, the incorporation of the rP2Y4 NH2 terminus onto chimera 4 increased the potencies of UTP and ATP 4- to 5-fold and converted ATP to an apparent full agonist, suggesting that the rP2Y4 NH2 terminus is a minor determinant of the agonist activity of ATP at the rP2Y4 receptor. Roles of Individual Amino Acids in EL2 of the Rat P2Y4 Receptor in Imparting Agonist Activity to ATP—Because EL2 was a major determinant of agonist versus antagonist activity at the two P2Y4 receptor homologues, we individually mutated each of the 5 divergent amino acids (Fig. 1A) in EL2 of the hP2Y4 receptor to the corresponding residue of the rP2Y4 receptor. Cells stably expressing these hP2Y4 receptor point mutants exhibited robust Ca2+ responses to UTP (Fig. 5), and the potencies of UTP at the mutant hP2Y4 receptors were very similar to that at the wild type hP2Y4 receptor (Table I). ATP was not an agonist in cells expressing the hP2Y4-N178A and hP2Y4-K179N mutants. In contrast, introduction of single point mutations at Ser-177 (S177N), Val-183 (V183I), and Arg-190 (R190L) resulted in P2Y4 receptors at which ATP was active, albeit with much lower efficacies and potencies than those observed in chimera 4/EL2 (Fig. 5). The EC50 values for ATP-promoted intracellular Ca2+ mobilization at these hP2Y4 mutant receptors could not be determined, because the concentration-response curves for ATP did not reach a maximum at less than millimolar concentrations. To determine if these three residues were the only determinants of ATP agonism in EL2, we mutated Ser-177, Val-183, and Arg-190 together to the corresponding residues of the rP2Y4 receptor (triple mutant) and generated concentration-response curves to ATP. The triple mutant receptor had essentially identical EC50 values for both UTP and ATP as chimera 4/EL2 (Table I), suggesting that these 3 residues act in concert to promote ATP agonism. The lack of activity of ATP at all concentrations tested at hP2Y4-N178A and hP2Y4-K179N receptors, together with the effects of the triple mutation, demonstrates that these residues have no role in ATP agonism in the P2Y4 receptor. Antagonist Effects of ATP at P2Y4 Receptor Chimeras and Point Mutants—The antagonist activity of ATP was also tested with the hP2Y4/rP2Y4 chimeras and point mutants. In each case, the capacity of ATP to inhibit UTP-promoted intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was determined in 1321N1 cells expressing these receptor constructs. Cells were superfused with increasing concentrations of ATP in the presence of a concentration of UTP (1 μm) similar to the EC50 values at the various P2Y4 constructs (Table I). As demonstrated previously (17Kennedy C. Qi A.D. Herold C.L. Harden T.K. Nicholas R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 926-931PubMed Google Scholar), ATP inhibited UTP-promoted Ca2+ mobilization in a concentration-dependent manner in cells expressing the hP2Y4 receptor (Fig. 6). Similarly, ATP retained its antagonist properties at chimeras 2, 3, 5, and 6 (data not shown). These results are consistent with the observation that ATP failed to activate these same receptors, thus providing additional evidence that the receptor domains exchanged in these chimeras are not determinants of agonism/antagonism of ATP at the P2Y4 receptor. In contrast, ATP had no antagonist activity at chimeras 1 (Fig. 6) and 7 (data not shown). Thus, in addition to EL2, the NH2 and COOH termini of the hP2Y4 receptor also appear to contribute to the capacity of ATP to act as an antagonist. The capacity of ATP to inhibit UTP-promoted intracellular Ca2+ mobilization also was determined in cells expressing the hP2Y4 receptor point mutants. ATP antagonized UTP-promoted intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in cells expressing the wild type hP2Y4 receptor as well as the hP2Y4-N178A, hP2Y4-K179N, and hP2Y4-V183I point mutants (Fig. 6 and data not shown). In contrast, 300 μm ATP did not antagonize UTP-promoted Ca2+ mobilization in cells expressing the hP2Y4-S177N mutant and inhibited ∼50% of the UTP-promoted intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in cells expressing the hP2Y4-R190L mutant (Fig. 6). Cell Surface Expression of P2Y4 Receptor Chimeras and Mutants—In face of the lack of a radioligand binding assay for quantification of surface expression of P2Y4 receptors, we incorporated an HA-epitope tag at their NH2 termini. This epitope tag was utilized to measure the relative cell surface expression of P2Y4 rec"

The reaction proceeds via a Schiff-base intermediate formed between Lys-53 and the Pald carbonyl. The x-ray crystal structures of the wild-type phosphonatase complexed with Mg(II) alone or with Mg(II) plus vinylsulfonate (a phosphonoethylenamine analog) were determined to 2.8 and 2.4 Å, respectively. These structures were used to determine the identity and positions of active site residues surrounding the Lys-53 ammonium group and the Pald carbonyl. These include Cys-22, His-56, Tyr-128, and Met-49. Site-directed mutagenesis was then employed to determine whether or not these groups participate in catalysis. Based on rate contributions, Tyr-128 and Cys-22 were eliminated as potential catalytic groups. The Lys-53 ∈-amino group, positioned for reaction with the Pald carbonyl, forms a hydrogen bond with water 120. Water 120 is also within hydrogen bond distance of an imidazole nitrogen of His-56 and the sulfur atom of Met-49.

Based on these results, it is proposed that a network of hydrogen bonds among Lys-53, water 120, His-56, and Met-49 facilitate proton transfer from Lys-53 to the carbinolamine intermediate.

Naturally occurring phosphonates return to the phosphate pool via the action of P–C bond lyases or hydrolases (for a recent review see Ref. 1Kononova S.V. Nesmeyanova M.A. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2002; 67: 184-195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Simple alkylphosphonates (e.g. methylphosphonate) are processed by homolytic P–C bond cleavage catalyzed by a membrane-associated multienzyme complex called “C–P lyase” (2Wackett L.P. Shames S.L. Venditti C.P. Walsh C.T. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 710-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). β-Carbonoalkylphosphonates, which contain polarized P–C bonds, undergo heterolytic bond cleavage reactions catalyzed by phosphonohydrolases. Known phosphonohydrolases include phosphonoacetate hydrolase (3McMullan G. Quinn J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 320-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), phosphonopyruvate hydrolase (4Ternan N.G. Quinn J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 378-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the topic of this paper, phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase (phosphonatase) 1The abbreviations used are: phosphonatase, phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase; Pald, phosphonoacetaldehyde; CNS, crystallography NMR software; vSO3, vinyl sulfonate. (5La Nauze J.M. Rosenberg H. Shaw D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 212: 332-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Phosphonatase catalyzes the dephosphonylation of phosphonoacetaldehyde (Pald) by using an active site amine (Lys-53) to convert the substrate aldehyde group to an iminium ion prior to P–C bond cleavage (Fig. 1). The leaving group is the low energy, Lys-53-N∈-ethylenamine. In earlier work, the Schiff-base formed between Lys-53 and the acetaldehyde product had been trapped and then identified by reduction of the iminium ion accumulated under steady-state conditions (6Olsen D.B. Hepburn T.W. Moos M. Mariano P.S. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2229-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Consistent with the role of the active site Lys-53 in Schiff-base formation, mutation to Arg resulted in total loss of catalytic activity (7Baker A.S. Ciocci M.J. Metcalf W.W. Kim J. Babbitt P.C. Wanner B.L. Martin B.M. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9305-9315Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Phosphonatase shares the use of electrophilic catalysis by Schiff-base formation with numerous C–C bond-cleaving enzymes including acetoacetate decarboxylase, transaldolase, and Class I aldolases (for review see Ref. 8Allen K.N. Sinnot M. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis. Academic Press, New York1998: 135-172Google Scholar). Model studies of amine versus enzyme (acetoacetate decarboxylase) catalyzed decarboxylation of acetoacetate have shown that Schiff-base formation with the enzyme active site amine is at least 1000-fold faster than with the solvated amine (8Allen K.N. Sinnot M. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis. Academic Press, New York1998: 135-172Google Scholar, 9Guthrie J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 7024-7029Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 10Guthrie J.P. Westheimer F.H. Fed. Proc. 1967; 26: 562Google Scholar, 11Marion H. O'Leary Baughn R.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The rate difference derives in part from the ability of the enzyme to shuttle protons to and from the reaction site. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the solution reaction proceeds via the attack of the neutral amine on the reactant carbonyl carbon to form a dipolar intermediate (12Jencks W.P. Catalysis in Chemistry and Enzymology. McGraw Hill Inc., New York1969: 121-122Google Scholar). The proton moves from nitrogen to oxygen in the dipolar intermediate to form the neutral carbinolamine. The nonbonding electrons on the nitrogen of the carbinolamine serve to expel the hydroxide and form the protonated Schiff-base. In the enzyme active site, a proton can be removed from the Lys-Ne-ammonium group, facilitating nucleophilic attack on the substrate carbonyl, and further along the reaction pathway, a proton can be delivered to the carbinolamine hydroxyl group as it is expelled en route to Schiff-base formation. The aim of this study was to determine whether such proton transfers occur in the phosphonatase catalytic mechanism, first by determining the proximity of active site acid/base groups relative to the reaction center using x-ray crystallographic techniques. These residues were then evaluated as possible acid/base catalysts by replacing them via site-directed mutagenesis and measuring the catalytic efficiency of the mutant enzyme. In this paper, the results of the structure-function study are reported, and a mechanism for Schiff base formation in phosphonatase catalysis is proposed. Preparation of Wild-type and Mutant Phosphonatase—Pald was prepared according to the published procedure (13Isbell A.F. Englert L.F. Rosenberg H. J. Org. Chem. 1969; 34: 755-756Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The wild-type Bacillus cereus enzyme was prepared from the Escherichia coli clone as described previously (7Baker A.S. Ciocci M.J.

Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10385-10396Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The mutant genes were generated by polymerase chain reaction using the plasmid pKK223-3 containing the wild-type phosphonatase gene (7Baker A.S. Ciocci M.J. Metcalf W.W. Kim J. Babbitt P.C. Wanner B.L. Martin B.M. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9305-9315Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) as template. The C22A, C22S, M49L, H56A, Y128A, Y128F, and Y128F/C22S phosphonatase mutants were purified using the same procedure used to purify the wild-type enzyme (7Baker A.S. Ciocci M.J. Metcalf W.W. Kim J. Babbitt P.C. Wanner B.L. Martin B.M. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9305-9315Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) in yields of 10–20 mg/g cell paste. The chromatographic behavior, solubility, and stability to storage of the mutants were similar to those of the wild-type enzyme. Steady-state Kinetic Constants—The Km and Vmax values for wild-type and mutant phosphonatases were determined from the initial velocity data measured as a function of Pald concentration (0.5–10 Km). The 1-ml reaction solutions contained Pald, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mm NADH, and 5 units of alcohol dehydrogenase dissolved in 50 mm K+-Hepes (pH 7.5, 25 °C). The concentration of phosphonatase used was in the range of 0.02 to 2.0 μm depending on the mutant studied. Reactions were monitored at 340 nm (Δ∈ = 6200 m-1 cm-1) for the conversion of acetaldehyde and NADH to ethanol and NAD+. The initial velocity data were analyzed using Equation 1, Vo=Vmax[A]/(Km+[A])(Eq. 1) where [A] is the substrate concentration, Vo is the initial velocity, Vmax is the maximum velocity, and Km is the Michaelis constant. The kcat was calculated from Vmax and the enzyme concentration using the equation kcat = Vmax/[E]. The enzyme concentration was determined using the Bradford method (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). The Ki of vinylsulfonate (vSO3) was determined by measuring the initial velocity of phosphonatase-catalyzed hydrolysis of Pald as a function of substrate concentration (25–300 μm) and vSO3 concentration (0-, 2-, and 4-fold Ki). The Ki value was calculated from the initial velocity data by using the rate equation for competitive inhibition, υ=VS/[Km(1+I/Ki)+S](Eq. 2) where v is the initial velocity, V is the maximal velocity, S is the concentration of the substrate, Km is the Michaelis constant for the substrate, and I is the concentration of the inhibitor. Crystallization and Data Collection—Wild-type phosphonatase was concentrated to 10 mg protein/ml in 1 mm K+-Hepes, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol (pH 7.5, 4 °C). Protein crystals were obtained by using the vapor diffusion method with hanging-drop geometry at 18 °C as described previously for crystallization of the wild-type enzyme (16Morais M.C. Baker A.S. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) (viz. 10 μl each of protein solution and well solution consisting of 30% polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 100 mm MgCl2). Large (0.4 mm/side) crystals grew within a week. For the vSO3-bound structure, 5 mm vSO3 was added to the well solution during crystallization. Before data collection, crystals were soaked (1–12 h) in well solution plus 20% glycerol and frozen in a stream of nitrogen gas cooled by liquid nitrogen at -180 °C. Data were collected on beamline X12B at Brookhaven National Laboratory’s National Synchrotron Light Source using a 60-mm MAR detector (to 2.8 Å resolution for the crystal of the phosphonatase-Mg(II) complex and to 2.4 Å for the phosphonatase-Mg(II)-vSO3 complex. The DENZO and SCALEPACK programs (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar) were used for data indexing, reduction, and scaling. Crystals of both complexes were monoclinic and belong to space group C2. Crystals of the phosphonatase-Mg(II) complex had unit-cell dimensions of a = 210.13 Å, b = 45.18 Å, c = 63.64 Å, and β = 105.1°, and crystals of the phosphonatase-Mg(II)-vSO3 complex were isomorphous, with unit-cell dimensions of a = 209.97 Å, b = 45.27 Å, c = 64.63 Å, and β = 104.9°. Assuming a Matthew’s coefficient of 2.3, the unit-cell dimensions are consistent with a dimer in the asymmetric unit for both crystals (18Matthews B.W. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 114: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Structure Solution and Refinement—The molecular replacement method was used to phase the data sets (19Rossmann M.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 20Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The 3.0 Å structure of the phosphonatase-Mg(II)-tungstate complex (Protein Data Bank accession code 1FEZ (14Morais M.C. Zhang W. Baker A.S. Zhang G. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10385-10396Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar)), with tungstate and water molecules removed, was positioned in the C2 cell with the program AMoRE (20Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) using data between 10.0 and 4.2 Å. The previously solved structure showed that phosphonatase exists in an open and a closed conformation of the cap domain relative to the core domain, and therefore the search model comprised combinations of open and closed monomers. The dimer model corresponding to one “open” and one “closed” monomer resulted in the best initial AMoRE solution, as well as the lowest R-factor after rigid body refinement. The initial molecular replacement solutions for the structures were subjected to one round of simulated annealing using slow-cool torsional molecular dynamics as implemented in CNS excluding 7% of the data for the calculation of Rfree (21Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar). Iterative cycles of minimization against the x-ray terms as implemented in CNS followed by manual rebuilding using the graphics program O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) using 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps were performed until Rfree ceased to decrease. The final models incorporated 256 of 267 possible amino acids for both structures. Residues 1–4 and 261–267 were not visible in the electron density map of any structure and were omitted from the final model. At this stage, group B-factors were refined followed by refinement of individual B-factors. Noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints (300 kcal mol-1 Å-2 in initial rounds and 50 kcal mol-1 Å-2 in the final round) between the two monomers in the dimer were used in all stages of refinement. Waters were added with the automated water-picking program in CNS using a 3.0 σ cutoff in Fo - Fc maps (60 total for the phosphonatase-Mg(II) structure and 123 total for the phosphonatase-Mg(II)-vSO3 structure). A model of vSO3 was built in the program QUANTA (Molecular Simulations Inc.) and fit into the active site of the enzyme using a 2 Fo - Fc simulated annealing omit map and a Fo - Fc map. Relevant refinement statistics are given in Table I. Analysis of the Ramachandran plot of the final model showed good geometry as defined by PROCHECK (23Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) for both structures. Connolly (solvent accessible) surfaces were calculated using the program VOIDOO (24Kleywegt G.J.

Both structures are homodimers of 30-kDa subunits, as is the structure of the phosphonatase-Mg(II)-tungstate complex described previously (14Morais M.C. Zhang W. Baker A.S. Zhang G. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10385-10396Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In each structure, both subunits contain a Mg(II) ligand. In the phosphonatase-Mg(II)-vSO3 structure, only one of the two subunits contain the vSO3 ligand. Occupancy of a single subunit was also observed in the phosphonatase-Mg(II)-tungstate complex, in which only one of the two subunits contained tungstate. The phosphonatase subunit observed in the structures reported here, and in the phosphonatase-Mg(II)-tungstate complex reported previously, consists of a cap domain (residues 21–99) and a larger core domain (residues 5–20 and 100–260) (Fig. 3A). Both Mg(II) and vSO3 bind to the core domain. The sulfono group of the vSO3 binds to the same site in the core domain as tungstate (an analog of the orthophosphate product) binds in the phosphonatase-Mg(II)-tungstate complex (14Morais M.C. Zhang W. Baker A.S. Zhang G. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10385-10396Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The Schiff base forming Lys-53 is located on the cap domain. The core domain has an α/β-type structure consisting of a centrally located six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (β4-β3-β1-β5-β6-β7) surrounded by six α-helices. The “cap domain” is inserted between the first β-strand (β1) and the first α-helix (α6) of the core domain through two flexible, solvated linker regions (residues 20–24 (L1) and 99–104 (L2). The cap domain consists of an anti-parallel, five-helix bundle. Helices α1, α3, and α4 are all approximately three-turn helices, whereas α2 and α5 are two- and five-turn helices, respectively. Helices α2 and α3 and the short loop between them point toward the core domain of the protein and form one half of the subunit interface. The residues that make up the other half of the subunit interface are positioned on loops connecting the strands of the β-sheet within the core domain. In the published phosphonatase-Mg(II)-tungstate complex, the subunit that contains the tungstate ligand assumes a closed conformation in which the cap domain is bound to the core domain. The subunit that contains only the Mg(II), assumes an open conformation in which the cap and core domains are separated. The structure of the phosphonatase-Mg(II) complex reveals one subunit in the open conformation and one subunit in the closed conformation. This is also true of the phosphonatase-Mg(II)-vSO3 structure, in which the subunit that contains the vSO3 ligand is in the closed conformation. The α-carbons of the subunits of the phosphonatase-Mg(II) complex can be superimposed on those of the phosphonatase-Mg(II)-vSO3 structure, having the same conformation (i.e. open or closed) with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.61 Å. Therefore, it is apparent that the vSO3 ligand does not induce a change in backbone conformation within the core domain or cap domain. Solution studies have indicated that vSO3 (or tungstate) binding stabilizes the closed conformation (25Zhang G. Mazurkie A.S. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13370-13377Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Here we observe that vSO3 (or tungstate) binding is not necessary for formation of the closed conformation (i.e. both open and closed conformations are seen in the phosphonatase-Mg(II) complex); however only the closed conformation is observed when the core domain active site is complexed with ligand. Conversion of the open to the closed conformation involves the movement of the cap and core domains as “rigid bodies” with the residues of the two linkers (23–26 and 90–94) acting as a mechanical hinge (see Fig. 3B). The movement of the cap domain with respect to the core domain produces a rotation of 22° (calculated with the program DynDom (26Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar)), resulting in a change in position of residues at the top of the cap domain by as much as 10.3Å (measured by the position of the Cα of residue 75). The difference in the backbone positions of the Schiff base-forming Lys-53 and surrounding residues is in the range of 3 to 4 Å. The catalytically active conformation is the closed conformation. The catalytic site is formed by residues from the core and cap domains, which in turn must be associated to exclude solvent. For the open conformer, the calculated Connolly surface map delineates more than one path by which substrate and product association/dissociation can be achieved. In contrast, in the closed conformation, there is no pathway connecting the active site to bulk solvent. In fact, the only pocket large enough to accommodate solvent lies within the active site, coinciding with the binding site of the vSO3. This result suggests that substrate binds to the open form of the enzyme and that catalysis follows conversion to the closed conformer. Active Site Residues—The electron density map of the active site region of the phosphonatase-sulfonate-Mg(II)-vSO3 is shown in stereo in Fig. 4A, and a view of the entire active site is shown in Fig. 4B. Importantly, two ordered, active site water molecules (Wat-111 and Wat-120) are clearly seen in the phosphonatase-Mg(II)-vSO3 structure that were not previously observed in the structure of the phosphonatase-Mg(II)-tungstate complex (solved at 3.0 Å resolution). Two additional water molecules in the phosphonatase-Mg(II) complex replace the two sulfonate oxygens of vSO3 ligand in the phosphonatase-Mg(II)-vSO3 structure. vSO3, which competes with Pald for the core domain binding site, has a Ki = 1.79 ± 0.03 mm at pH 7.0. The phosphonatase-Mg(II)-vSO3 complex may “roughly” resemble the Lys53-N-ethylene-Asp8-phosphate enzyme intermediate that is formed by Asp8 catalyzed dephosphonylation of the Schiff base formed between Pald and Lys53 (Fig. 1). Fig. 4C shows the-active site model in which Pald is substituted for the vSO3. Because both the tungstate ligand and the sulfono group of the vSO3 ligand occupy the same binding site, the Pald phosphonyl binding site is certain. The carbon chain of the Pald fits well into the space occupied by the vinyl group of the vSO3 ligand and the amino acid side chains and water molecules that surround it are easily identified. From the active site model, it can be seen that Lys53 is positioned for nucleophilic attack on the Pald carbonyl carbon and that the Pald carbonyl oxygen is within hydrogen bond distance of Wat-120. Wat-120 is also in close proximity to the Lys-53 N∈-amine group, the His-56 ring nitrogen, and the Met-49 sulfur atom. The functional groups of Cys-22 and Tyr-128 (and Wat-111) are peripheral to the reaction center (∼6 Å from the Pald carbonyl oxygen), but they do nevertheless contribute to its microenvironment. Based on an alignment of the eight known phosphonatase sequences, His-56, Met-49, and Tyr-128 are shown to be stringently conserved, but Cys-22 is not (in seven sequences it is replaced by Ser). To evaluate their contributions to catalysis, His-56, Met-49, Cys-22, and Tyr-128 were replaced by site-directed mutagenesis. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Potential Catalytic Groups— From previous studies, carried out with the phosphonatase from Samonella typhimurium, it is known that replacement of the Schiff-base-forming Lys with Arg removes all catalytic activity (7). B. cereus phosphonatase mutant proteins were purified and characterized and the catalytic constants resulting from the amino acid substitutions of residues surrounding the Lys-53 are reported in Table II. Cys-22 and Tyr-128 were mutated separately and then together. The kcat/Km for C22A was 100-fold less than that of the wild-type enzyme whereas the kcat/Km of C22S mutant was only 10-fold less. Thus, it appears that the size and polarity of the Cys-22 side chain (approximated in the C22S mutant but not in the C22A mutant) is important but not essential. The acidity of the thiol group, crucial if the residue is to function in acid/base catalysis, cannot be considered a key factor in catalysis because the C22S mutant retains 10% wild-type activity in B. cereus phosphonatase and because Ser functions in place of Cys-22 in other phosphonatases.Table IIThe steady-state kinetic constants for wild-type and mutant phosphonatase Reactions contained Pald, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mm NADH, and 5 units/ml alcohol dehydrogenase in 50 mm K+-Hepes (pH 7.5, 25 °C). The concentration of phosphonatase used was in the range of 0.02 to 2 μm depending on the mutant studied.EnzymekcatKmKcat/Kms-1μms-1 m-1Wild type1.5 ± 0.1 × 10133 ± 25.0 × 105Y128F2.21 ± 0.0245 ± 24.9 × 104Y128A7.73 ± .03 × 10-235 ± 32.2 × 103C22A1.95 ± 0.04530 ± 203.7 × 103C22S2.26 ± 0.0933 ± 56.9 × 104Y128F/C22S2.11 ± 0.0333 ± 26.4 × 104H56A7.5 ± 0.1 × 10-2145 ± 65.2 × 102M49L1.5 ± 0.1 × 10-15.1 ± 0.3 × 1032.9 × 101 Open table in a new tab The kcat/Km value for Y128F phosphonatase was 10-fold smaller than that of wild-type phosphonatase and the kcat/Km value for Y128A was 230-fold smaller. The space filling character of the aromatic ring, which was retained in the Y128F mutant but not in the Y128A mutant, is therefore considered to be important for efficient catalysis. The rate contribution of the side chain hydroxyl group (a factor of 10) was, however, too small to support its role in acid/base catalysis. Interestingly, the effects of amino acid substitution at both sites were not additive. The kcat/Km of the Y128F/C22S double mutant was only 10-fold less than that of wild-type phosphonatase. We have concluded that Cys-22 and Tyr-128 (and the Wat-111 that forms a hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl of the Tyr ring) do not play important roles in catalysis, i.e. they do not function as acid/base catalysts. The replacement of Met-49 with Leu resulted in a 17,000-fold reduction in kcat/Km. The space-filling property of the Met-49 side chain was retained in the M49L mutant, but the potential for interaction between the sulfur atom and Wat-120 was obviated. The replacement of His-56 with Ala and the resulting loss of acid/base and/or hydrogen-bonding function resulted in a 1000-fold reduction in kcat/Km. Thus, both His-56 and Met-49 are thought to play important roles in catalysis. Schiff-base Formation—The structure of the phosphonatase active site with Mg(II) and modeled Pald (Fig. 4C) indicates that the N∈-amino group of Lys-53 is positioned for attack at the Pald carbonyl. Tyr-128 (with bound Wat-111) and Cys-22 are, however, too far removed from the two reacting groups to function as acid or base catalysts. Indeed, the Y128F/C22S double mutant retains 10% of the wild-type phosphonatase activity. Based on their unfavorable orientation and small rate cont"
https://openalex.org/W1988556626,"Human-induced climate change is one of the most important environmental issues facing society worldwide. The overwhelming majority of scientific experts and governments acknowledge that there is strong scientific evidence demonstrating that human activities are changing the Earth's climate and that further human-induced climate change is inevitable. Changes in the Earth's climate are projected to adversely affect socioeconomic systems (such as water, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries), terrestrial and aquatic ecological systems, and human health. Developing countries are projected to be most adversely affected, and poor people within them are the most vulnerable. The magnitude and timing of changes in the Earth's climate will depend on the future demand for energy, the way it is produced and used, and changes in land use, which in turn affect emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosol precursors.

The most comprehensive and ambitious attempt to negotiate binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions is contained in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, an agreement forged in a meeting of more than 160 nations, in which most developed countries agreed to reduce their emissions by 5 to 10% relative to the levels emitted in 1990. Although the near-term challenge for most industrialized countries is to achieve their Kyoto targets, the long-term challenge is to meet the objectives of Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), i.e., stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at levels that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, with specific attention being paid to food security, ecological systems, and sustainable economic development. To stabilize the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide requires that emissions eventually be reduced to only a small fraction of current emissions, i.e., 5 to 10% of current emissions.

All major industrialized countries except the United States, the Russian Federation, and Australia have ratified the Kyoto Protocol. The United States and Australia have publicly stated that they will not ratify it, and statements from the Russian Federation are contradictory. Russian ratification is essential for the Kyoto Protocol to enter into force.

The United States has stated that the Kyoto Protocol is flawed policy for four reasons:



1. There are still considerable scientific uncertainties. However, although it is possible that the projected human-induced changes in climate have been overestimated, it is equally possible that they have been underestimated. Hence, scientific uncertainties, as agreed by the governments under Article 3 of the UNFCCC, are no excuse for inaction (the precautionary principle).

2. High compliance costs would hurt the U.S. economy. This is in contrast to the analysis of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which estimated that the costs of compliance for the United States would be between US$14 and US$135 per ton of carbon avoided with international carbon dioxide emissions trading (a 5-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax would be equivalent to US$20 per ton of carbon). These costs could be further reduced by the use of carbon sinks, by carbon trading with developing countries, and by the reduction of other greenhouse gas emissions.

3. It is not fair, because large developing countries such as India and China are not obligated to reduce their emissions. However, fairness is an equity issue. The parties to the Kyoto Protocol agreed that industrialized countries had an obligation to take the first steps to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, recognizing that ∼80% of the total anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases have been emitted from industrialized countries (the United States currently emits ∼25% of global emissions); that per capita emissions in industrialized countries far exceed those from developing countries; that developing countries do not have the financial, technological, or institutional capability of industrialized countries to address the issue; and that increased use of energy is essential for poverty alleviation and long-term economic growth in developing countries.

4. It will not be effective, because developing countries are not obligated to reduce their emissions. It is true that long-term stabilization of the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases cannot be achieved without global reductions, especially given that most of the projected growth in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 100 years is from developing countries. Hence, developing countries will have to limit their emissions of greenhouse gases, but industrialized countries should take the lead, as agreed in Kyoto.



Protection of the climate system will require substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions; hence, the Kyoto Protocol is recognized to be only the first step on a long journey to protect the climate system. However, unless the United States agrees to meaningful reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, it is highly unlikely that major developing countries will agree to limit their emissions or that industrialized countries will agree to further reductions beyond those already agreed in Kyoto.

One very positive development is that about half of the U.S. states have enacted some climate protection measures, and there are a number of initiatives in the U.S. Congress that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Although the McCain-Lieberman Climate Stewardship Act failed to pass in the Senate, 43 senators did vote for it, demonstrating an increasing recognition by members of Congress that there is an urgent need to deal with the climate issue. In addition, more than 40 multinational companies have voluntarily agreed to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases and to improve the energy efficiency of their products. Several of these companies have already met or exceeded their initial targets and have saved money in doing so.

Technologies exist or can be developed to cost-effectively limit the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide to between 450 and 550 parts per million (ppm), but it will take political will, enhanced research and development activities, public-private partnerships, and supporting policies to overcome barriers to the diffusion of these technologies into the marketplace. A number of countries, including the United States, have committed themselves to developing climate-friendly technologies, but the level of investment must be substantially increased. The Kyoto Protocol needs to be ratified, and the United States needs to take meaningful actions to reduce its greenhouse gas concentrations. Governments should then consider setting a long-term target based either on a greenhouse gas stabilization level (between 450 and 550 ppm) or on limits for both the absolute magnitude of global temperature change (less than 2 to 3°C) and the rate of temperature change (less than 0.2°C per decade). A series of intermediate targets can then be developed to involve developing countries in an equitable manner. The need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions offers a unique opportunity to modernize energy systems and enhance competitiveness in a globalized world."

Newer approaches continue to rely on science to identify problems and solve them, but use other mechanisms to set standards and legal obligations.

Consequently, the sibling cell that inherits the asymmetric determinants adopts a different fate from the one that does not.

These proteins were identified through their requirement in the development of Drosophila peripheral and central nervous systems. The external sensory organ in Drosophila is composed of two outer (hair and socket) cells and three inner (sheath, glial, and neuron) cells, which are derived from a single sensory organ precursor through three consecutive asymmetric cell divisions. Numb is selectively partitioned to one of the two daughter cells at each binary division (15Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 772-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).

During delaminating from the neuroectoderm and asymmetric division of a neuroblast, Numb, Prospero, and several other proteins are co-localized in a basal cortical crescent. These proteins are partitioned to the basal daughter cell or the ganglion mother cell, which will divide once more, generating two neurons or a neuron and a glial cell. The apical daughter to which the proteins were not partitioned maintains the neuroblast characteristics and is capable of undergoing several additional rounds of cell division (18Knoblich J.A. Nat.

NAK is proposed to be a Numb-associated Ser/Thr kinase that negatively regulates Numb function (26Chien C.T. Wang S. Rothenberg M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). LNX is a unique protein containing a ring finger and multiple PDZ domains that acts as an E3 ligase for the ubiquitination and degradation of mNumb (28Nie J. McGill M.A. Dermer M. Dho S.E. Wolting C.D. McGlade C.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The identification of this array of binding partners for Numb reflects the promiscuous nature of its PTB domain. Unlike the majority of PTB domains that require tyrosine phosphorylation for binding, the Numb PTB domain is capable of binding unphosphorylated sequences, some of which are devoid of Tyr residues (29Li S.-C. Songyang Z. Vincent S.J. Zwahlen C. Wiley S. Cantley L. Kay L.E. Forman-Kay J. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7204-7209Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30Li S.-C.

Although our understanding of the mechanism of Numb function as an intrinsic cell fate determinant has advanced tremendously with the identification of these Numb-binding proteins, a fundamental question remains unanswered. How is the cytoplasmic protein Numb recruited to the cell membrane in a basally localized crescent within a neuroblast, which is a prerequisite for the specific partitioning of Numb into one of two daughter cells at cell division? Because Numb lacks a transmembrane segment, its recruitment to the membrane would necessarily involve one of several possible mechanisms: by binding to a membrane lipid(s), by directly or indirectly interacting with a membrane protein, or by engaging a protein transporting machinery (32Knoblich J.A. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1994; 76: 477-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 33Knoblich J.A. Jan L.Y Jan Y.N.

The pivotal role of the PTB domain is further underscored by the observation that it is indispensable not only for Numb localization during sensory organ precursor and neuroblast division but also for the specification of sibling cell fates (34Knoblich J.A.

The broad specificity of the Numb PTB domain suggests that additional binding proteins may exist that localizes Numb to the plasma membrane. To search for these proteins, we screened a Drosophila embryonic cDNA library using an isolated Numb PTB domain as a probe and identified a binding protein that we designated NIP (Numb-interacting protein). NIP is an intrinsic membrane protein that interacts specifically with Numb in vitro and in vivo and is required for the membrane recruitment of Numb. Proteins homologous to Drosophila NIP were identified in various other species ranging from Anopheles to Homo sapiens, suggesting that the function of NIP is evolutionarily conserved. Expression Library Screening and Cloning of NIP—The Drosophila Numb PTB domain was purified from Escherichia coli as described (31Zwahlen C. Li S.-C. Kay L.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1505-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Purified PTB domain was labeled with biotin using the biotin-LC-NHS reagent (Pierce) and then used to screen a 22–24-h Drosophila embryonic cDNA library constructed with the λEXlox vector (Novagen) following the manufacturer's protocols. Clones displaying positive binding to biotin-PTB were identified using streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad) followed by a phosphatase reaction using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrates. The plasmids were isolated for DNA sequencing. From 500,000 phage plaques in the primary screening, a total of nine positives were identified, of which four displayed extensive overlaps with one another and were apparently derived from a single gene. The longest open reading frame from these four clones encodes a 190-residue fragment of a protein. This sequence was used to search the Drosophila expression sequence tag data base and several expression sequence tag clones were retrieved. The longest expression sequence tag clone (LD14488; Invitrogen) contained an open reading frame that encoded a protein of 474 amino acids, and the coding sequence was PCR-amplified and subcloned into a pOT2 vector (Invitrogen). Constructs and Antibodies—Full-length NIP cDNA was subcloned by PCR amplification into pEGFP, pFLAG-CMV2, or pcDNA3 vectors as required. Fragments encoding various truncated forms of NIP, e.g. NIP-N (residues 1–106), NIP-N1 (residues 1–148), NIP-N1/2 (residues 1–382), NIP-N2 (amino acids 363–474), and NIP-C (amino acids 368–474) were generated by PCR and subcloned into pFLAG-CMV2. Full-length Drosophila Numb (556 amino acids) was subcloned into a pcDNA3 or a pEGFP vectors. Numb and various fragments of Numb, e.g. Nb-N (residues 1–76), Nb-PTB (residues 58–205), and Nb-C (residues 205–556), were cloned respectively into a pGEX4T2 (Amersham Biosciences) vector and expressed as GST fusion in E. coli. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against Drosophila Numb was raised using a peptide containing the C-terminal 16 residues of Numb. Anti-NIP antibody was generated similarly using a peptide (CLPNPPVERIRDMDHW) derived from the C terminus of the protein. Where necessary, these antibodies were affinity-purified and labeled with either FITC or NHS-rhodamine (Pierce). Texas Red- and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. Anti-digoxigenin-AP was from Roche Applied Science, propidium iodide was from Sigma, and TOPRO-3 was from Molecular Probes. A mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. Northern Blot and in Situ Hybridization—Total RNA from the embryonic, larval, pupal, or adult stage of Drosophila was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) (37Qin H. Ishiwata T. Asano G. J. Pathol. 2001; 195: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A total of 12.5 μg of RNA was separated by electrophoresis on a formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred overnight to a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The blot was then cross-linked and hybridized at 42 °C to RNA probe (101 bases, corresponding to nucleotides 426–527 of the NIP cDNA) labeled with [α-32P] dCTP. Digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes specific for the full-length NIP and Numb were prepared by in vitro transcription with T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase with random priming according to manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Applied Science). The embryos were collected, fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and hybridized to the probe at 55 °C. After exposing the embryo to anti-Digoxigenin-AP for 2 h, a color reaction was initiated by incubating with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Cell Culture, GST Pull-down, and Immunoprecipitation Experiments—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 and Cos-7 cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and appropriate antibiotics. For transient transfection, the cells were allowed to grow to 50–70% confluence in 10-cm dishes, and ∼ 5 μg of DNA was added with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) in serum-free medium. GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out essentially as described (38Li C. Jia C.Y. Han V.K. Li S.S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3852-3859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Peptide Synthesis and Fluorescence Polarization—Peptides containing the NERF or the NKGF motif were synthesized on an A431 peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl-)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. Fluorescein-NHS (Molecular Probes) was coupled on-resin to the N terminus of the peptide in the presence of triethanolamine. The labeled peptide was cleaved off the resin using trifluoroacetic acid and purified with high pressure liquid chromatography using a Luna C18 column (Phenomonnex). Fluorescence polarization measurements were conducted using established procedures as previously reported (38Li C. Jia C.Y. Han V.K. Li S.S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3852-3859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—To observe the localization of NIP in Drosophila, embryos were collected from 3.5 to 4.5 h at 25 °C after egg laying, dechorionated in 3% bleach, and fixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. The embryos were then blocked for nonspecific reaction using 1% skim milk for 30 min at room temperature and exposed to the primary antibody for 2 h. This is followed by a treatment with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (used at 1:50 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h at room temperature. The nuclei of cells were stained with propidium iodide. Confocal images were recorded on a Zeiss confocal microscope (LSM410). To observe a direct interaction between NIP and Numb in cells, Cos-7 cells were transfected with pEGFP Numb in the presence or absence of pFLAG-NIP or a mutant. Mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoRes. Labs, Inc.) were used to detect NIP in cells. The LSM 410 software was used for image analysis. The reported images were processed using Adobe Photoshop. RNAi—S2 cells were maintained in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) at 23 °C. The RNAi technique was performed according to Clemens et al. (39Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T. Hemmings B.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Full-length NIP (1990 bp) single-strand RNA was prepared by in vitro transcription with T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase. Briefly, the cells were diluted to a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in Drosophila expression system (DES) serum-free medium (Invitrogen) and plated in 6-well culture dishes with coverslips. Double-stranded (ds) RNA was added directly to the medium. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, 2 ml of Schneider's Drosophila medium with fetal bovine serum was added and incubated for another 72 h. For Western blots, the cells were harvested and pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g. The cell pellets were lysed in 40 μl of Laemmli buffer, and 20 μl of lysate was used on a 12% SDS-PAGE. Western blot analyses were performed as described above. Anti-NIP and anti-Numb antibodies were used at 1:500 dilution, respectively, whereas anti-β-tublin was applied at 1:5000 dilution. Isolation of a Drosophila cDNA Encoding a Numb-interacting Protein—Biotinylated Numb PTB domain was used to screen a 22–24-h Drosophila embryonic cDNA library. From 500,000 primaries, we obtained four clones of overlapping sequences, representing the partial cDNA of the gene CG4482-PA (40Adams M.D. et al.Science. 2000; 287: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (4744) Google Scholar). The expression sequence tag clone LD14488 (Invitrogen) was used to isolate the full-length cDNA, which encodes a protein of 474 amino acids with a predicated molecular mass of 53,348 daltons (Fig. 1A). The protein was named NIP. The NIP gene maps to the region 35B7–35B8 on chromosome 2L in the Drosophila genome (40Adams M.D. et al.Science. 2000; 287: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (4744) Google Scholar). Sequence analyses by SMART (41Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 42Letunic I. Goodstadt L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) suggest that NIP is a membrane protein with six readily identifiable transmembrane (TM) segments (Fig. 1A). Another potential TM segment located at residues 156–171 (Fig. 1A) has a relatively lower average hydrophobicity compared with those of the other TM segments. When this segment is included, NIP has an overall structure of a seven-TM segment receptor (43Kilpatrick G.L. Dautzenberg F.M. Martin G.R. Eglin R.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 294-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In addition, two candidate Numb PTB domain-binding sites, NERF (residues 134–137) and NKGF (residues 363–366), were found between TM segments 3 and 4 and at the C-terminal portion of the protein, respectively (Fig. 1A).Fig. 1The nipgene encodes a multi-spanning membrane protein. A, cDNA sequence of the nip gene and the deduced protein (NIP) sequence. A Kyte-Doolittle (58Kyte J. Doolittle R. J. Mol.

An YNEXFXW motif shared conserved in all NIP proteins is identified by a rectangle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Exhaustive homology-based sequence searches against protein databases retrieved several proteins in various species ranging from Anopheles gambiae to Homo Sapiens that share sequence similarity with Drosophila NIP. Significant sequence similarity was detected at the N-terminal halves of the proteins that include the predicted transmembrane segments, whereas the C-terminal halves were less conserved (Fig. 1B). Of the two candidate Numb PTB domain-binding sites, the first, represented by a degenerated sequence of (F/Y)NEXFX(W/I), where X represents an undefined amino acid, is conserved in all species examined, whereas the second site, typified by the sequence EN(K/R)GFQ, was shared only by the Anopheles and Drosophila NIP proteins (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, two mouse NIP (mNIP) variants were identified, of which only one (mNIP2) displays significant sequence identity (70–93%) to the rat (rNIP) or human counterpart (hNIP). All mammalian NIPs, except for hNIP, are truncated at the C terminus relative to Drosophila NIP. Identification of NIP Transcripts in Whole Drosophila Embryos and the NIP Protein in Embryonic Lysate—The accumulation of NIP transcripts was investigated by Northern blot analysis. Total RNA was extracted from Drosophila embryos (0–16 h), larvae, pupae, and adults and hybridized to 32P-labeled NIP antisense RNA. As shown in Fig. 2A, a transcript of ∼2.0 kb was detected in embryos, larvae, and adult samples. The size of the transcript corresponds to the length of the cDNA LD14488 (1990 bp). The NIP transcript was most abundant in embryos, adults, and pupae and was barely detectable in larvae. This pattern of NIP transcript accumulation, particularly the low level observed at the larvae stage, is reminiscent of that of Numb (9Uemura T. Shepherd S. Ackerman L. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1989; 58: 349-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies to the NIP protein were generated using a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 16 residues of the predicted protein sequence. A Western blot of Drosophila embryonic lysate revealed a band at 53 kDa, which agrees with the expected molecular mass of 53,348 daltons. Characterization of a Numb-NIP Interaction in Vitro and in Vivo—GST pull-down experiments were carried out to examine whether Numb and NIP can interact with each other in vitro. Specifically, GST-NIP immobilized on glutathione beads was used to precipitate Numb from lysate of HEK 293 cells transfected with Numb cDNA. As seen in Fig. 3A, GST-NIP was capable of bringing down Numb from cell lysate, whereas the control GST failed to do so. In a reciprocal experiment, GST-Numb was found to precipitate NIP from 293 cells (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that NIP and Numb interact specifically with each other in vitro. To ascertain that this interaction occurs in vivo, we used the Drosophila lysate in a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay. However, because of the similar size of NIP and immunoglobulin heavy chain, it proved difficult to obtain conclusive results. An alternative strategy was therefore taken using FLAG-tagged NIP. Specifically, 293 cells were co-transfected with expressing constructs for Numb and FLAG-NIP, and the cell lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation using either a mouse anti-FLAG antibody, a rabbit anti-Numb antibody, or nonspecific IgG. As shown in Fig. 3C, Numb was detected in anti-FLAG (NIP) immunoprecipitates but not in those using control IgG. Conversely, NIP was observed to co-IP with Numb (Fig. 3D). These data demonstrate that a Numb-NIP interaction can occur in the physiological setting of a cell. A PTB Domain-NXXF Motif Interaction Mediates the Association of Numb with NIP—Although NIP was cloned as a PTB domain-binding protein, it is necessary to verify whether other regions in Numb contribute to the Numb-NIP interaction. To this end, three truncation constructs corresponding respectively to the N terminus (Nb-N, residues 1–76), the PTB domain (Nb-PTB, residues 58–205), and the C-terminal region (Nb-C, residues 205–556) of Numb were generated and cloned into a pGEX4T2 vector (Fig. 4A). The Numb fragments expressed as GST fusion were used to bring down NIP from 293 cells. Only Nb-PTB was able to precipitate NIP from 293 cells, whereas the other two fragments of Numb and the control GST failed to do so (Fig. 4B). To determine the regions in NIP responsible"

In addition to being essential for the synthesis of cysteine by transsulfuration, CBS is also a key regulator of plasma total Hcy (tHcy) levels (1Mudd S.H. Levy H.L. Kraus J.P. Scriver C.R.

CBS deficiency is the most common cause of homocystinuria, an inherited autosomal recessive metabolic disease, which if untreated, causes skeletal abnormalities, dislocated optic lenses, mental retardation, and a dramatically increased incidence of vascular disorders particularly thromboembolic disease (1Mudd S.H.

Because of the key role of CBS in regulating plasma tHcy levels, there is a need for a greater understanding of the mechanisms and principles that govern its regulation. Previously, we have determined the complete genomic sequence of human CBS (6Kraus J.P. Oliveriusova J. Sokolova J. Kraus E. Vlcek C. de Franchis R. Maclean K.N. Bao L. Bukovska G. Patterson D. Paces V. Ansorge W. Kozich V. Genomics. 1998; 52: 312-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and mapped the transcriptional start sites of five human CBS mRNA isoforms, designated CBS –1a, –1b, –1c, –1d, and –1e, respectively (7Bao L. Vlcek C. Paces V. Kraus J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Of these, we found that isoforms –1a and –1b form the vast majority of transcripts, whereas isoforms –1c, –1d, and –1e are relatively rare. We identified two promoter regions upstream of exons –1a and –1b and found that the –1b promoter has ∼10-fold greater promoter activity than that of the –1a promoter in both HepG2 and COS7 cells (6Kraus J.P. Oliveriusova J. Sokolova J. Kraus E. Vlcek C. de Franchis R. Maclean K.N. Bao L. Bukovska G. Patterson D. Paces V. Ansorge W. Kozich V.

The CBS promoter regions constitute an interesting paradox in that they have multiple sites of transcriptional initiation, are GC-rich and lack the classic TATA box sequence. Yet, despite having all of the usual characteristics of a ubiquitously expressed “housekeeping” gene, CBS is expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner with a wide range of tissues completely negative for CBS activity. The temporal and spatial expression patterns of CBS appear to be developmentally regulated (8Mudd S.H. Finkelstein J.D. Irreverre F. Laster L. J. Biol.

Recently, we have shown that both human and yeast CBS are coordinately regulated with proliferation and that the human CBS –1b promoter is serum- and fibroblast growth factor-responsive and is down-regulated by growth arrest due to nutrient depletion or the action of differentiation-inducing reagents (10Maclean K.N.

Another group has recently investigated the CBS –1b promoter and defined the minimal promoter region as a 125-bp region of sequence proximal to exon –1b. These investigators also found that the –1b promoter is activated by a synergistic interaction between NF-Y and either Sp1 or Sp3 (12Ge Y. Konrad M.A. Matherly L.H. Taub J.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). CBS expression levels in HepG2 and HT1080 cells were directly correlated with differences in the level of Sp1/Sp3 binding to the CBS –1b promoter region in these cells possibly as a consequence of phosphorylation by protein kinase A. This finding was proposed as a possible mechanism for the tissue-specific regulation of CBS (13Ge Y. Matherly L.H. Taub J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43570-43579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this report, we examine ∼5 kbp of CBS 5′-flanking sequence for the ability to modulate CBS expression and to confer tissue-specific expression. We demonstrate that as little as 32 bp of the –1b proximal promoter region is capable of driving transcription in HepG2 cells and that a single Sp1/Egr1 binding site is essential for this activity. Both the CBS –1b and –1a promoters are regulated in a proliferation-sensitive manner by Sp1 and that, although this transcription factor is involved in a previously unreported synergistic interaction with Sp3 in specifically regulating the –1b promoter, neither Sp3 nor NF-Y are able to substitute for Sp1 in vivo. Additionally, we present evidence to show that members of the KLF family of transcription factors have the potential to play a role in the tissue-specific regulation of the CBS gene by acting to block transcriptional activation of the CBS promoters by Sp1.

Genomics. 1998; 52: 312-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The largest reporter construct CBS476 (–8943 to –3576), was generated by subcloning the EcoRI-XbaI fragment from the P1 cosmid into pZERO-2 (Invitrogen). This region was then excised from this vector as a KpnI-XbaI fragment and ligated into pCBS478, which had been cut with the same enzymes. In this manner we generated a range of larger CBS promoter luciferase constructs with up to 5276 kbp of 5′-flanking sequence. To investigate the minimal sequence region of the –1b promoter capable of driving transcription, we made progressive deletion derivatives of our base construct pCBS47. Two constructs, pCBS474 (–3877 to –3576) and pCB475 (–3792 to –3576) were made by end filling and subsequent blunt-end ligating after digesting pCBS47 with KpnI and SphI or ApaI, respectively. The pCBS473 construct (–3737 to –3576) was generated by subcloning of a PCR fragment amplified from a pCBS 47 template using sense (5′-CGTAGGTACCTGCTCTGGCACGAGACAT-3′) and antisense (5′-TACGAAGCTTCTGGACGGATACATGGAAAAGAGG-3′) primers. Nucleotides shown in boldface represent KpnI (sense) and HindIII (antisense) sites introduced to facilitate directional cloning of the amplification product. The sequence of this clone was verified by DNA sequencing. The pCBS472 (–3699 to –3576) and pCBS471 (–3679 to –3576) were generated by sub-cloning double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides containing the desired sequences. This strategy was also used to generate mutant forms of pCBS472 with the CCAAT sequence mutated to CGTTG (pCBS472-1) or the Sp1 core CGCC sequence mutated to CTTC (pCBS472-2). All of the pCBS47 –1b reporter construct derivatives tested had a common 3′ end that included the transcription start sites defined previously upstream of exon –1b (7Bao L. Vlcek C. Paces V.

Osborne (University of California, Irvine, CA). The mammalian expression construct D4 NF-YA-m29 expressing the dominant negative NF-YA29 subunit, capable of forming an inactive NF-Y complex by trimerization with NF-YB and NF-YC, was obtained from Dr. Roberto Mantovani (University of Milan, Italy). The Sp1 mammalian and Drosophila expression constructs pAct-Sp1, pPacUSp3, pRc/CMV/Sp3, and pCGN-Sp1 and their relevant empty parent vectors that were used as negative controls were all provided by Dr. Paul Gardner (Brudnick Neuropsychiatric Research Institute, Worcester, MA) and were used with the kind permission of Drs. Edward Seto (University of South Florida, FL), Thomas Shenk (Princeton University, NJ), and Guntram Suske (Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany). The LKLF mammalian expression construct pBKCMVwtLKLF was a generous gift from Dr. Jerry Lingrel (University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, OH) and the KLF8 and BKLF expression constructs pMT2.BKLF, pMT2.KLF8, and pPac.BKLF were kindly provided by Dr. Merlin Crossley (University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia). Transient transfections and subsequent luciferase reporter assays in actively proliferating cells were performed as described previously (10Maclean K.N. Janosik M. Kraus E. Kozich V. Allen R.H. Raab B.K. Kraus J.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Analysis of CBS Expression—CBS enzyme activity was determined by a previously described radioisotope assay using [14C]serine as the labeled substrate (15Kraus J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 388-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). One unit of activity is defined as the amount of CBS that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of cystathionine in 1 h at 37 °C. SDS Western blots were performed after running 10- to 75-μg samples of total protein on 9% polyacrylamide gels. Transfer, primary, and secondary antibody incubation conditions and subsequent detection using ECL chemiluminescent reagents were performed as described previously (16Janosik M. Oliveriusova J.

Nuclear Extracts and EMSA—Nuclear extracts were prepared from actively proliferating HepG2 cells (60% confluent) as described previously (17Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed using a lightshift chemiluminescent EMSA kit according to the manufacturer’s standard protocol. The minimally active –1b promoter region was generated for EMSA by synthesizing oligonucleotides representing the proximal 32-bp probe of sequence. The oligonucleotide 5′-GCCAATCACCGCCCGCCTGCTCCCCTCGCCGT-3′ and its reverse complement, 5′-ACGGCGAGGGGAGCAGGCGGGCGGTGATTGGC-3′, were labeled using a biotin 3′-end labeling kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Standard EMSA reactions contained 20 μg of cell extract and 60 fmol of biotin end-labeled DNA in a 20-μl volume binding reaction in the presence of 2.5% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 ng/μl of poly(dI·dC), and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. EMSA reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min, terminated by adding 2 μl of 10× loading buffer (0.2% (w/v) bromphenol blue and 0.2% xylene cyanol containing 10% (v/v) glycerol), and then separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels pre-run at 100 V for 30 min in 0.5× TAE buffer (0.02 m Tris-acetate, 0.001 m EDTA) and subsequently run at 150 V for 4 h after sample loading. Reaction products were then transferred to a Biodyne B membrane (Pierce) by capillary transfer and fixed by UV cross-linking. The biotin-labeled reaction products were then visualized by incubation with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate and subsequent incubation with ECL chemiluminescent reagents. DNase I Footprinting—The SphI-HindIII DNA fragment bearing 210 bp of –1b proximal sequence was excised from pCBS474 as an SphI-HindIII fragment into the high copy number vector pUC19. This region was then excised as a BamHI-HindIII fragment, gel-purified, 5′-end-labeled with 32P on either the top (at the BamH1 site) or bottom strand (at the HindIII site), and used as a probe in DNase I footprinting as described previously (18Wade D.P. Lindahl G.E. Lawn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19757-19765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 4 × 104 cpm of labeled probe was incubated with either 50 or 75 μg of crude nuclear extract derived from actively proliferating (∼60% confluence) HepG2 cells for 10 min at room temperature in DNase I digestion buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 3 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mm spermine, and 0.5 mm spermidine). The reaction mixture was then subjected to digestion with DNase I (20 μg/ml) for 90 s at room temperature. Reaction products were run on a 6% polyacrylamide/8 m urea sequencing gel with control probe that had been incubated with DNase I in the absence of nuclear extract and a guanine sequencing ladder derived from the fragment for sequence positioning purposes. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography. Defining the CBS –1b Basal Promoter—In our first study of the CBS –1b promoter we examined the 388-bp region between the end of exon –1a and the start of exon –1b for promoter activity (6Kraus J.P. Oliveriusova J. Sokolova J. Kraus E. Vlcek C. de Franchis R. Maclean K.N. Bao L. Bukovska G. Patterson D. Paces V. Ansorge W. Kozich V. Genomics. 1998; 52: 312-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Subsequent reports regarding the CBS basal promoter activity have been essentially confined to this 481-bp region (12Ge Y. Konrad M.A. Matherly L.H. Taub J.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Ge Y. Matherly L.H. Taub J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43570-43579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Ge Y. Jensen T.L. Matherly L.H. Taub J.W. Blood. 2003; 101: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, it is not unusual for sequence elements several kbp upstream of the transcriptional start sites to contain sequence elements that significantly modulate basal activity or confer tissue-specific expression. To fully define the CBS –1b basal promoter and to search for both enhancer and repressor sequence elements, we examined a series of CBS –1b promoter reporter constructs with up to 5276 kbp of 5′-flanking sequence in promoter assays after transient transfection into HepG2 cells. We used our previously reported 479-bp CBS –1b luciferase reporter construct pCBS47 (–4055 to –3576) as a reference for comparative purposes. The results of these experiments (Fig. 1) indicated that the presence of an additional 4787 kbp of flanking sequence did not lead to any significant change in promoter activity relative to the original pCBS47 CBS –1b base construct. Deletion of an additional 259 bp from the pCBS47 construct did not adversely affect promoter activity. Further deletion of the CBS –1b promoter region was accompanied by significant reductions in the resultant promoter activity allowing us to define the 210 bp proximal to exon –1b as the basal promoter region. The observation that deletion of the region between the SphI and ApaI sites is accompanied by an approximate 50% reduction in promoter activity indicates that the 84-bp region between –3877 and –3792 contains sequence elements that contribute significantly to basal expression of the CBS –1b promoter. As Little As 32 bp of Proximal CBS –1b Promoter Sequence Is Capable of Driving Transcription in HepG2 Cells—To define the minimal portion of the CBS –1b promoter sequence capable of driving transcription, we generated a series of progressive 5′ deletion derivatives of pCBS47 and assayed them for promoter activity after transient transfection into HepG2 cells (Fig. 1). We were able to delete down from 82 to 32 bp (–3699 to –3576) before losing all detectable promoter activity. This definition of the minimal promoter differs significantly (4-fold smaller) from the previously published version, and, consequently, we examined the function of this region in detail. The pGL-enhancer vector used to make our pCBS472 expression construct contains an SV40 enhancer sequence located downstream of luc+ and the poly (A) signal. To assess the possible contribution of this downstream enhancer element to the sensitivity of our promoter assays, the –1b minimal promoter region was subcloned into pGL-basic, which lacks this SV40 enhancer sequence but is otherwise identical. When this 32-bp minimal promoter region was examined in the absence of the enhancer sequence in HepG2 cells it was found to have essentially identical promoter activity as was observed previously. Analysis of the minimal promoter sequence (Fig. 2A) shows one candidate Sp1 binding site that overlaps with a binding site for the zinc-finger transcription factor early growth-response protein (Egr1), one CCAAT box, and putative binding sites for Ap2, MZF1, IK2, and Gfi1. Ap2 is unlikely to contribute to the promoter activity of this construct, because it is not expressed in HepG2 cells (20Zeng Y.X. Somasundaram K. el-Deiry W.S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and has previously been shown to down-regulate CBS when heterologously expressed in these cells (10Maclean K.N. Janosik M. Kraus E. Kozich V. Allen R.H. Raab B.K. Kraus J.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The tissue distribution of Gfi1, IK2, and MZF1 (21Karsunky H. Zeng H.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) effectively precludes any role for these transcription factors in the regulation of CBS in tissues such as liver, kidney, pancreas, and brain, which are the main sites of transsulfuration in humans (8Mudd S.H. Finkelstein J.D. Irreverre F. Laster L. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4382-4392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the contribution of these transcription factors to CBS –1b promoter activity was not investigated. To assess the relative importance of the CCAAT box and the Sp1 site, we generated derivatives of the pCBS472 construct where these binding sites had been mutated. The effect of these mutations was examined by measuring their relative promoter activities in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2B). Mutagenesis of the CAAT box (pCBS472-1) did not affect the level of basal promoter activity in HepG2 cells indicating that this sequence does not play a crucial role in directing transcription from the –1b promoter in these cells. Mutagenesis of the Sp1/Egr1 site in the pCBS472-2 construct lead to the complete abolition of promoter activity indicating that the promoter activity of the CBS –1b minimal promoter sequence is dependent upon the Sp1-Egr1 binding site. DNA Footprinting Reveals Key Areas of the CBS –1b Minimal Promoter Region—DNase I footprinting analysis was performed using double-stranded fragments corresponding to nucleotides –3877 to –3786. This SphI-HindIII restriction fragment from pCBS474 contains 210 bp of –1b proximal sequence and was used as a probe in DNase I footprinting using a HepG2 cell extract generated as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 3, A and B). Scoring and interpretation of protected regions was performed blind by two independent observers with no prior knowledge of the CBS promoter or the results of our deletion and mutagenesis study described above. Three distinct regions designated Fp1 (–3808 to –3787 on the top strand and –3810 to –3783 on the bottom strand), Fp2 (–3715 to –3681 on the bottom strand), and Fp3 (–3664 to –3639 on the bottom strand) were found to be either partially or totally protected from DNase I digestion. Examination of the sequence contained within the protected Fp1 region revealed two adjacent Sp1 binding sites separated by a MZF1 site. Interestingly, these binding sites are present at the 3′ end of the 85-bp region that was shown in the previous section to contribute significantly to basal transcription indicating that these Sp1 sites are of considerable importance for maximal promoter activity. The vast majority of the Fp1 region was also found to be protected in a DNase I footprinting analysis of the –1b promoter region performed previously where it was described as region D (13Ge Y. Matherly L.H. Taub J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43570-43579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The second protected region (Fp2) was not previously reported to be protected (13Ge Y. Matherly L.H. Taub J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43570-43579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and contains the Sp1/Egr1 overlapping binding site that was shown to be essential for the minimal promoter function in the previous section and serves as an independent confirmation of the functional importance of this binding site. This protection is relatively weak, but it is part of the nature of the DNase I footprinting methods that the relative binding affinities of different sites afford different levels of protection from the DNase I treatment. The lower degree of protection of this site is presumably due to a relatively reduced level of Sp1 binding that is entirely consistent with the level of promoter activity that this site was shown to confer in the deletion analysis described above. Interestingly, the inverted CCAAT box-NF-Y binding site 40 bp upstream of the –1b minimal promoter sequence that has previously been identified as playing a key role in regulating the CBS –1b promoter (12Ge Y. Konrad M.A. Matherly L.H. Taub J.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Ge Y. Matherly L.H. Taub J.W. J. Biol.

We have independently found that NF-Y can weakly transactivate the CBS –1b promoter (but not –1a) in SL2 cells. 2K. N. Maclean, unpublished results. However, this site is close to a DNase I-hyper-sensitive site, which is typically indicative of conformational changes induced by protein binding and often occurs at sites where only a small fraction of the probe molecules are bound by protein. This finding suggests that NF-Y may bind to this sequence but is not present at a sufficiently high concentrat"

It is demonstrated here that forced expression of RICK in either a kinase active or inactive form activates nuclear factor (NF)-κB by means of its intermediate domain and potently blocks HCMV replication in human fibroblasts. Importantly, NF-κB activation, which exerted a modestly positive effect on the early phase of infection, clearly had a strongly negative impact during later viral steps. A stable inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) reverses the RICK inhibitory effect, and activation of NF-κB by IκB kinase β expression is inhibitory to HCMV, demonstrating that NF-κB activation is part of a potent anti-HCMV response. Supernatant transfer experiments identified interferon-β as a downstream component of the RICK inhibitory pathway. RICK expression was found to synergize with HCMV infection in the induction of interferon-β expression.

Alterations in host gene expression can be a useful starting point in efforts to identify novel anti-viral strategies. Up-regulated genes can be deliberately induced and used by pathogens for their own functions. Alternately, these novel gene expression events can be components of the host response to pathogen entry and replication, the innate immune response (reviewed in Refs. 1Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6247) Google Scholar, 2Inohara N. Nunez G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 3Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Science. 2003; 300: 1524-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Because of the long evolutionary interplay between host and pathogen, these factors are complex and not trivial to unravel. One major transcriptional program that has recently become clear is the innate immune response. This is an evolutionarily conserved, potent anti-pathogen response comprising a set of pattern recognition receptors including the Toll-like receptors on the cell surface as well as the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) 1The abbreviations used are: NOD, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; IKK, IκB kinase; IRF3, interferon regulatory protein 3; RICK, receptor interacting protein-like interacting caspase-like apoptosis regulatory protein kinase; HCMV, human cytomegalovirus; IFN-β, interferon-β; HFF, human foreskin fibroblasts; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; p/c, particles/cell; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; HA, hemagglutinin; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; IM, intermediate; RICK KIM, RICK kinase plus complete IM domain; gB, glycoprotein B; TLR2, Toll-like receptor 2. molecules intracellularly that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Upon engagement of a receptor with the appropriate pathogen-associated molecular pattern (lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan, double-stranded RNA, flagellin, etc.), this binding results in the recruitment and activation of several kinase complexes. Importantly, the scaffold protein NEMO (IKKγ) interacts with one of several kinases, IKKα, IKKβ, IKK∈, and tank binding kinase, resulting in the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (via IKK phosphorylation of IκB) or activation of IRF3 (via IKK∈ or tank-binding kinase; Refs. 4Fitzgerald K.A.

In turn, this selection of transcription factors activates anti-pathogen response genes, including the interferons and other cytokines, and host defense genes, such as NOS, IDO, PKR, various nucleases, and proteases. Thus, the innate immune response comprises three types of molecules: pathogen sensors on both the cell surface and intracellularly which respond to the presence of pathogen components by oligomerization and activation of a kinase complex; transcription factors, which are either directly or indirectly activated by the kinase complexes; and the activated host genes, whose composition is determined by the variety and extent of transcription factors activated.

Studies with mice homozygous for a disrupted RICK allele demonstrate an essential role for RICK in activating NF-κB, p38, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase downstream of several toll-like receptors and the intracellular NOD1 and NOD2 molecules, as well as playing an important role in the activation of interferon-γ expression in response to a variety of stimuli (9Chin A.I. Dempse P.W. Bruhn K. Miller J.F. Xu Y. Cheng G. Nature. 2002; 416: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 15Kobayashi K. Inohara N. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Nunez G. Jane-way C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2002; 416: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Given this broad range of cellular events activated by RICK, we sought to determine whether the observed RICK up-regulation is stimulatory to HCMV replication or, alternately, is activated by the host in response to HCMV infection and is part of a host defense program. An analysis of the role of RICK in HCMV replication revealed that modest overexpression of the RICK molecule is inhibitory to HCMV replication; the inhibition requires NF-κB activation, and the essential downstream components of the inhibition are NF-κB activation and the induction of interferon-β (IFN-β) production. Thus, it seems that RICK is contributing to the innate immune response of the HCMV infection, a response that under normal conditions is not sufficient to prevent HCMV replication. Quantification of RNA Induction—For analysis of RICK expression levels by real-time PCR, human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were infected with different HCMV isolates at the indicated m.o.i.s, harvested 24 or 72 h after infection, and the total RNA was isolated by the TRIzol method (Invitrogen), followed by a DNase I digest. 5 μg of RNA was used for reverse transcription with oligo dT primers. RICK expression was determined by real-time PCR and normalized with GAPDH expression. Real-time PCR was performed with SYBR Green on an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) with the following primers: RICK: 5′-ACGTCTGCAGCCTGGTATAGC-3′ and 5′-AGGGCATCTAGCGACTGGTTAA-3′; GAPDH: 5′-GGGTCATTGATGGCAACAATATC-3′ and 5-TCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGG-3′. IFN-β induction was measured with real-time PCR on an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system using the following primers: IFN-β, 5′-GACATCCCTGAGGAGATTAAGCA-3′ and 5′-GGAGCATCTCATAGATGGTCAATG-3′; hybridization probe, 5′-FAM-CGTCCTCCTTCTGGAACTGCTGCAG-TAMRA-3′. GAPDH was quantified by using an established TaqMan assay kit (ABI Prism predeveloped TaqMan assay reagent for human GAPDH, Applied Biosystems). Cell Culture—HFF and 293 cell cultures (24Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3512) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. NF-κB activation was monitored by using a minimal promoter bearing multiple NF-κB binding sites driving a luciferase cDNA, as described previously (16Chiocca S. Baker A. Cotten M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3168-3177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 × 104 293 cells per 96-well were transfected with 15 ng of p3K NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid and 4 ng of pGFP for normalization. 1 day later, the cells were treated with the indicated reagents, infected with recombinant adenovirus, or transfected in the presence of calcium phosphate and cultured for an additional 24 h. Luciferase activity was then detected by using standardized extracts with the Luclite Plus luciferase detection system from Packard BioSciences and normalized with GFP expression. Alternately, a stable 3T3 cell line bearing the same luciferase construct was used (see Fig. 4, a and d). Cytotoxicity Assay—Cell viability was measured 7 days after adenovirus transduction and/or HCMV infection by determining lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the cell layer by using a CytoTox 96 non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay (Promega), as described elsewhere (17Efferth T. Marschall M. Wang X. Huong S.M. Hauber I. Olbrich A. Kronschnabl M. Stamminger T. Huang E.S. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 18Marschall M. Stein-Gerlach M.

Recombinant Adenovirus Vector Construction and Purification—The cDNAs used here were isolated by PCR and cloned into a transfer vector and then into E1/E3-defective adenovirus type 5 genomes (see below). The full-length wild-type RICK open reading frame contained a cDNA identical to GenBank accession number AF027706 with a carboxyl terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag. To generate kinase inactive (ki) versions, either the kinase essential lysine residue 47 was mutated to arginine (K47R), or the essential aspartic acid residue 146 was mutated to asparagine (D146N) to generate kinase inactive forms of the protein. Both RICK K47R and RICK D146N showed similar activity in HCMV replication and NF-κB activation and are referred to as RICK ki throughout the text. RICK deleted of CARD and half of the intermediate domain (RICK dC) was generated from RICK wt or RICK K46R cDNAs and contains the first 353 amino acid residues of RICK with a carboxyl terminal HA tag (RICK dC; wt or ki). RICK KIM encodes the RICK kinase plus complete intermediate (IM) domain (amino acids 1-425); RICK IM encodes only the RICK intermediate domain (amino acids 292-425). An adenovirus encoding the second half of the intermediate plus CARD (amino acids 354-540) was constructed, but the transgene was only weakly expressed. To stabilize the protein, amino acids 354-450 were fused to the C terminus of EGFP to generate the eCARD plasmid and adenovirus (these molecules are summarized in Fig. 4e). The RIP cDNA is identical to GenBank accession number NM_003804 and contains, in addition, a carboxyl-terminal HA tag. The IKKβ cDNA is identical to GenBank accession numbers AF080157 and BD062400 and contains, in addition, a carboxyl-terminal strep-tag. The IκBα S32A/S36A mutation (termed IκBΔ here) is identical to that described previously (19Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar, 20Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). The recombinant adenoviruses used in this study were E1/E3-defective derivatives of adenovirus type 5 (21Russell W.C. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2573-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The cDNAs of desired proteins were cloned into a transfer plasmid, with expression driven by an HCMV IE promoter/enhancer and mRNA stability and polyadenylation directed by a rabbit β-globin intron/polyadenylation signal. This expression cassette was introduced into a bacterial plasmid-borne adenovirus genome using recombination in bacteria (22Chartier C. Degryse E. Gantzer M. Dieterle A. Pavirani A. Mehtali M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4805-4810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Michou A.-I. Lehrmann H. Saltik M. Cotten M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1399-1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A cloned version of the novel adenovirus genome was identified, the viral genome was released from the plasmid by restriction enzyme digestion, and virus replication was initiated by transfecting the genome into the E1-complementing 293 cells (24Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3512) Google Scholar) using a polyethylenimine transfection method (23Michou A.-I. Lehrmann H. Saltik M. Cotten M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1399-1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Virus was amplified and purified from cell lysates by using CsCl density gradient centrifugation as described (25Cotten M. Baker A. Birnstiel M.L. Zatloukal K. Wagner E. Dracopoli N.C. Haines J.L. Korf B.R. Moir D.T. Morton C.C. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Smith D.R. Current Protocols in Human Genetics.

Boulanger P. Virology. 1980; 101: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Control adenovirus AdJ5 is an Ad5 vector with the same viral genotype (E1/E3 defective) but lacking an expression cassette. HCMV Methods—For HCMV-replication assays, subconfluent monolayers were transduced with recombinant adenoviruses as indicated in each figure legend. At 48 h after adenoviral transduction, cells were infected with an HCMV strain AD169 producing EGFP (HCMV AD169-GFP; 27Marschall M. Freitag M. Weiler S. Sorg G. Stamminger T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1588-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and cultured for 7 days. Cells were then lysed (in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) and analyzed for EGFP content in a Wallac Victor fluorescence detector. Alternatively, HCMV replication was quantified by using a plaque-formation assay. Subconfluent HFF monolayers were infected with the HCMV strain AD169 24 h after adenoviral transduction. After cultivation for an additional 8 days, cells were stained with crystal violet, and the numbers of viral plaques per well counted. RICK mRNA and Protein Levels Are Increased during HCMV Infection—In a broad screen of cellular signaling molecules influenced by HCMV replication, the serine/threonine adapter kinase RICK was found to be up-regulated during productive HCMV replication in primary HFFs. Initial results using the DNA filter array revealed a consistent increase in RICK mRNA levels (results not shown). Infection with the HCMV laboratory strain AD169 resulted in an increase of RICK on both the protein and RNA levels (Fig. 1a). Infection with three independent clinical isolates of HCMV (isolate 3, isolate 4, and TB40E) also resulted in an increase of RICK protein and mRNA levels (Fig. 1b). In the clinical HCMV strains, up-regulation of RICK was less pronounced on the protein than on the RNA level. RICK Inhibits the Replication of HCMV—A major concern in interpreting elevated levels of host protein or RNA during virus infection is to determine whether the increase is directly activated by the pathogen and used to promote the course of infection, or if the up-regulated protein is part of a host defense pathway. To address this important question, an assay system based on replication-defective adenovirus vectors was developed to monitor the effects of specific cellular protein expression on HCMV replication. HCMV replication was measured by using HCMV AD169-GFP, (27Marschall M. Freitag M. Weiler S. Sorg G. Stamminger T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1588-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Infection, replication, and spread of HCMV over a 7-day period resulted in a reliable EGFP signal that could be quantitated (Fig. 2a, compare lanes 1 and 2). Adenovirus vectors were prepared that direct expression of test proteins throughout an entire culture of fibroblasts (e.g. luciferase or EGFP with >90% of the cells expressing the test protein, results not shown). Transduction of HFFs with a control adenovirus AdJ5 (E1/E3 negative, no expression cassette) had no significant effect of HCMV replication (Fig. 2a, lanes 3 and 4). However, transduction with a RICK-expressing adenovirus at the same viral particle/cell number severely impaired the replication of HCMV (Fig. 2a, lanes 5 and 6). Transduction with an adenovirus-expressing RICK ki had the same inhibitory effect on HCMV replication as RICK wt (Fig. 2a, lanes 7 and 8). RICK has an intermediate domain as well as a C-terminal CARD (Caspase Recruitment Domain; Refs. 12McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 13Inohara N. del Peso L. Koseki T. Chen S. Nunez G. J. Biol.

Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 188-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Deletion of the CARD (plus 1/2 of the IM) of either RICK wt or RICK ki led to increased expression of the proteins (Fig. 2b) but largely destroyed the HCMV inhibitory activity (Fig. 2a, lanes 9-12). Thus, the forced expression of RICK inhibits HCMV replication, the inhibition does not require the serine/threonine kinase activity of RICK but is sensitive to mutations that disrupt the intermediate domain and remove the CARD. The slightly reduced mobility of the RICK protein caused by the HA-epitope allows one to estimate that the viral-expressed RICK was ∼5-fold over endogenous levels (Fig. 2c). Expression of the RICK CARD (plus 1/2 of the IM, the portion of RICK removed in the ΔCARD molecule) fused to an EGFP molecule, also did not impair HCMV replication (Fig. 3a, lanes 8 and 9). Furthermore, transduction of HFFs with an adenovirus directing synthesis of the kinase RIP, which belongs to the same kinase family, was found to have no effect on HCMV replication (Fig. 3a, lanes 10 and 11, RIP wt), although the two kinases, RICK and RIP, were expressed to similar levels (Fig. 3a, lower panel). Furthermore, no inhibition of HCMV replication was observed when cells were transduced with the same quantities of adenovirus expressing the cellular kinases SRPK2, NIK (Nck interacting kinase), or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (results not shown). Thus, the observed effect of full-length RICK on HCMV replication was not due to trivial consequences of overexpressing a mammalian kinase with adenovirus.Fig. 3a, subconfluent HFF cultures were transduced with 1000 or 3000 p/c of either control adenovirus J5, AdRICK wt, AdRICKΔCARD, AdRICKeCARD, or AdRIP. At 48 h after adenoviral transduction, cells were infected with HCMV AD169-GFP and cultured for an additional 7 days. Cells were then lysed and analyzed for EGFP content as above. Lower panel, to monitor expression, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, the lysates were separated by SDS-10% PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with an anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science) or anti-tubulin or extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2 as loading control. b, HCMV plaque replication assay. Subconfluent HFF monolayers were transduced with 3000 p/c of control AdJ5, or 300, 1000, or 3000 p/c of adenovirus expressing the indicated RICK molecules, or left untreated for control. All adenovirus transductions were adjusted to equal adenovirus levels (3000 p/c) with AdJ5. At 24 h after adenoviral transduction, cells were infected with the HCMV strain AD169, cultured for an additional 8 days, stained with crystal violet, and the numbers of viral plaques per well were counted. c, cytotoxicity assay. HFF cells were infected with 300, 1000, or 3000 p/c of either control AdJ5 or adenoviruses expressing the indicated RICK molecules, followed by HCMV infection, as described above. Cell viability was measured after 7 days by determining LDH activity in the cell layer, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Note that in this procedure, high LDH levels indicate low levels of cytotoxicity. All values were determined in quadruplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As an additional measure of the RICK inhibition of HCMV replication, cells were transduced with the various RICK adenoviruses or control adenovirus and infected with HCMV AD169; HCMV replication was monitored directly by a conventional plaque assay (Fig. 3b). Consistent with the results obtained with the GFP assay, expression of full-length RICK in either the kinase active or kinase inactive forms blocked the replication of HCMV (Fig. 3b, lanes 4-9). The removal of the RICK CARD and 1/2 of the IM was again found to disrupt the HCMV inhibitory effect (Fig. 3b, lanes 10-12). Under some conditions such as co-overexpression of caspase (13Inohara N. del Peso L. Koseki T. Chen S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12296-12300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) or expression in a tumor cell line (12McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), RICK overexpression results in increased apoptosis. We found that in HFFs, cell viability was not influenced by transduction with adenovirus directing the expression of RICK in either the absence of HCMV replication (Fig. 3c, upper panel) or in the presence of HCMV replication (Fig. 3c, lower panel). Thus, the impairment of HCMV replication cannot be accounted for by an increased cell death promoted by RICK. The Inhibition of HCMV Replication by RICK Correlates with Its Ability to Activate NF-κB—RICK activates the NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (11Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J.L. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

To identify downstream effectors mediating HCMV inhibition, we analyzed the RICK constructs tested against HCMV for NF-kB activation. RICK with wild-type kinase activity (Fig 4a, lanes 4-6) as well as kinase inactive RICK (Fig. 4a, lanes 7-9) activated NF-κB to levels comparable with that obtained with TNFα (Fig. 4a, lane 2). Transduction with the control adenovirus J5 at the same concentrations did not activate NF-κB (Fig. 4a, lane 3 shows 10,000 particles/cell (p/c) AdJ5). Removal of amino acids 354-540, which remove the CARD and part of the intermediate domain of either kinase wt or ki forms, disrupted the ability of RICK to activate NF-κB (Fig. 4a, lanes 10-15). The activation of NF-κB signaling by the different RICK constructs correlated closely with their ability to inhibit HCMV replication (Fig. 2). Blocking NF-κB Activation Prevents the RICK Inhibition of HCMV—The correlation between RICK molecules that activate NF-κB and inhibit HCMV replication suggested that the NF-κB activation may be an essential part of activating an intracellular anti-viral response. To test the hypothesis that RICK inhibits HCMV replication by means of the activation of NF-κB, we examined the consequences of expressing an IκBα S32A/S"

Depending on the B cell maturation stage, recognition of self-antigens by the BCR can induce cell death, anergy, or receptor editing (1Meffre E. Nussenzweig M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

BCR signal output also contributes to the developmental fate of peripheral B cells (2Niiro H. Clark E.A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 5Cariappa A. Pillai S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, recognition of self-antigens by the BCR has also been shown to induce positive selection in transgenic models (6Hayakawa K. Asano M. Shinton S.A. Gui M. Allman D. Stewart C.L. Silver J. Hardy R.R. Science. 1999; 285: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 7Hardy R.R. Li Y.S. Allman D. Asano M. Gui M. Hayakawa K. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 175: 23-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In precursor B (pre-B) lymphocytes, surface expression of the pre-BCR is necessary for cell proliferation, repertoire selection, and allelic exclusion (8Martensson I.L. Rolink A. Melchers F. Mundt C. Licence S. Shimizu T. Semin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The BCR consists of an antigen-binding subunit made of two covalently associated μ or δ immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chains (HC), each covalently bound to an Ig light chain (LC). This dimer is bound to one Igα/Igβ heterodimer that makes up the signaling unit of the BCR. In pre-B cells, a surrogate light chain made of the association of the VpreB and λ5 proteins substitutes for the conventional Ig light chain, thus making a pre-BCR. For proper expression of these protein complexes at the cell surface, it is assumed that their assembly and transport are regulated by a “quality control” mechanism inside the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This involves interactions with ER-resident chaperones that ensure that incorrectly assembled protein complexes and assembly intermediates are retained in the ER and/or are ultimately degraded following retrotranslocation into the cytoplasm (9Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 10Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Curr. Opin.

Sci. 1999; 24: 266-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In the case of both the BCR and pre-BCR, interactions with the Bip/GRP78/HSPA5, GRP94, and calnexin chaperones have been described (13Lassoued K. Illges H. Benlagha K. Cooper M.D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that Bip binds to the CH1 domain of free Ig heavy chains to retain them in the ER and that the binding of the light chains to the complex releases Bip in an ATPase-dependent manner, allowing the complete folding of Ig protein subunits (14Kaloff C.R. Haas I.G. Immunity. 1995; 2: 629-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Retention of assembled pre-BCR complexes in the ER has been attributed to pre-B cell intrinsic factor(s) (15Brouns G.S. de Vries E. Neefjes J.J. Borst J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19272-19278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and to the non-Ig region of λ5 (16Fang T. Smith B.P. Roman C.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3846-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This retention leads to low pre-BCR surface expression compared with BCR expression on immature and mature B cells. This low expression is presumably necessary for the tight regulation of cell proliferation at the large pre-B cell stage in a ligand-independent (17Rolink A.G. Winkler T. Melchers F. Andersson J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) or ligand-dependent manner (18Gauthier L. Rossi B. Roux F. Termine E. Schiff C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This small polypeptide resembles an IgLC variable domain and also shows similarities with the VpreB protein (19Shirasawa T. Ohnishi K. Hagiwara S. Shigemoto K. Takebe Y. Rajewsky K. Takemori T.

VpreB3 in murine pre-B cells seems to bind transiently to IgμHC chain during the course of pre-BCR assembly in the ER (21Ohnishi K. Takemori T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28347-28353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but its function is unknown. VpreB3 mRNA is expressed at high level from the pro-B to the immature B cell stage (22Hoffmann R. Seidl T. Neeb M. Rolink A. Melchers F. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 98-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), thereby indicating possible participation of VpreB3 in the biosynthesis of the BCR and pre-BCR. In this report we describe the identification of the chicken VpreB3 gene. Using the chicken DT40 immature B cell line, we have demonstrated that binding of free IgLC to VpreB3 negatively regulates their maturation and secretion. This work reveals biochemical and functional characteristics of VpreB3 that may have appeared early in the course of the evolution of the adaptative immune system. Cells, Antibodies, and Reagents—DT40 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% chicken serum (both heat-inactivated for 30 min at 56 °C), 50 μM 2-ME, 2 mml-glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin. DT40 VJL–/– cells (a kind gift from J. M. Buerstedde and H. Arakawa, Institute for Molecular Radiobiology, Neuherberg, Germany) were grown in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml histidinol and 1.5 mg/ml hygromycin. Polyclonal goat anti-chicken IgM-μ chain-specific Abs and anti-chicken light chain were from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX). Anti-MYC mouse monoclonal Abs 9E10 and 9B11 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA), respectively. M1 mouse monoclonal anti-chicken μ chain was from Southern Biotech Associates (Birmingham, AL). Fluorophore-conjugated reagents for confocal microscopy were Texas Red-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated concavalin A, BODIPY FLC5-ceramide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and rhodamine-conjugated anti-goat IgG (Sigma). Flow Cytometry—0.2 × 106 cells were suspended in PBS 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% sodium azide containing 0.5 μg/ml of M1 Ab. After washings, staining was obtained with phycoerythrin-labeled goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG (Beckman-Coulter). Confocal Microscopy—5 × 105 DT40 cells were seeded per poly(l)lysine (Sigma)-treated glass coverslip (Marienfeld, Lauda-Koenigshofen, Germany) and allowed to adhere for 30 min at 37 °C. After fixation using a 4% paraformaldehyde solution, cells were preincubated for 20 min at room temperature with PBS, 0.2% gelatin (Sigma), 0.1% saponin (Sigma), washed in PBS, incubated for 45 min with appropriate primary Ab dilutions, washed in PBS, and incubated for 30 min with a secondary Ab dilution in the case of unconjugated primary Abs. Slides were examined using an LSM-510 Carl Zeiss (Jena, Germany) confocal microscope using the ×63 objective. Metabolic Labeling—For metabolic labeling, cells were washed once in PBS and suspended in labeling medium (RPMI 1640 minus methionine and cysteine plus 3% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 0.3% dialyzed chicken serum) at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml for 45 min. For long-term labeling, the cells were subsequently suspended at a concentration of 5 × 106 in fresh labeling medium containing 50 μCi/ml l-[35S]Cys and 50 μCi/ml Expre35S35S protein labeling mix (Met 77%, Cys 17%; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 4 h. For pulse-chase metabolic labeling, cells were suspended at a concentration of 40 × 106 cells/ml in fresh labeling medium containing 200 μCi/ml l-[35S]Cys and 200 μCi/ml Expre35S35S protein labeling mix for 15 min. Next, 10 volumes of normal culture medium containing an excess (5 mm) of cysteine and methionine was added. After centrifugation, cells were suspended in the same medium for the indicated chase times. Before lysis, cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS 2% bovine serum albumin and once in ice-cold PBS. Cell Lysis and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed at a concentration of 15 to 30 × 106 cells/ml in 20 mm Tris-Hcl, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 2.5 mm iodoacetamide, 7 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For immunoprecipitation, 10 μg of Ab were conjugated to protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 4–12 h in lysis buffer and then saturated for 2 h in PBS, 5% bovine serum albumin. After two washes in lysis buffer, beads were incubated with cell lysates for 3–4 h. When non-radiolabeled lysates were used, immunoprecipitates were collected and washed three times in lysis buffer. When radiolabeled lysates were used, a preclearing was performed by incubating the lysates overnight in the presence of control Ig-conjugated protein G-Sepharose beads. After immunoprecipitation with specific Abs, immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 100 μl of Tris-Hcl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma), 0.5% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and deposited at the top of a sucrose cushion consisting of 400 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 20% sucrose overlaid by 400 μl of Tris-Hcl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Igepal CA-630, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10% sucrose. After 5 min of centrifugation, immunoprecipitates were washed once in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Igepal, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate and once in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Igepal. Immune complexes were then heated in SDS/2-ME-containing loading buffer and separated on polyacrylamide gels. Radioactive gels were fixed in 15% methanol, 7.5% acetic acid and treated with Amplify reagent (Amersham Biosciences) before drying and exposure on autoradiograhic film and/or using a Bas-1500 imager (Fujifilm, Stamford, CT). Image analysis and quantification were performed using the Tina software (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). EndoH Treatment—Washed protein G-Sepharose beads bound to immune complexes were resuspended and incubated at 95 °C for 7 min two successive times in 70 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 5 mm dithiothreitol. Then 13 μl of trisodium citrate, pH 5.5, was added to 70 μl in the presence of protease inhibitors with or without 5 milliunits of endoH (Sigma) for 18 h. Western Immunoblotting—Polyacrylamide gels were transferred onto Immobilon membrane (Millipore, St.-Quentin-Yvelines, France), and the membranes were probed following the recommendations of the manufacturer with the indicated Abs at a concentration of 1 μg/ml in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dry milk. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse (Sigma) or anti-goat (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) Ig Abs or protein G (Sigma) were used for detection by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Bioscience). Two-dimension Gel Analysis—Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in non-reducing sample buffer (Tris-HCl 125 mm, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.02% bromphenol blue) and run in the first dimension by 12.5 SDS-PAGE. The relevant strips were then cut out, incubated in sample buffer with 4% 2-ME at 95 °C for 10 min, and run in the second dimension using 12.5% SDS-PAGE. VpreB3 Expression Plasmid—A full-length chicken VpreB3 EST (GenBank™ accession no. AJ395785) from the bursal dkfz426 cDNA library was obtained from J. M. Buerstedde. A Myc tag epitope-coding sequence was added at the 3′-end by PCR using the following oligonucleotides: sense primer, 5′-GTGAATTCTGCAGCCTACCATGGTCCTGGGCTT-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-CGAATTCACAGATCCTCTTCTGAGATGAGTTTTTGTTCCAGCCAGTTGATGGTGAGG-3′. The amplified product was first cloned in the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and subsequently in the pApuro expression vector using EcoRI restriction sites. For this latter purpose, a pApuro vector containing a Btk insert cloned at the EcoRI site was obtained from R. Guinamard (Centre d’Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy). Transfections—All transfections were performed by electroporation at 550 V and 25 μF with 50 μg of linearized plasmid and 10 × 106 cells in 800 μl of PBS using a Genepulser II with a capacitance expander (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The pApuro-derived vectors were linearized by NotI. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Analysis—cDNA was prepared from 2 μg of total RNA, using random hexamers and the Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a volume of 20 μl. PCR was performed in a PTC-200 apparatus (MJ Research Inc., Waltham, MA) using 1 μl of reverse-transcribed RNA for VpreB3 (or 1 μl of a 1/100 dilution for Gapdh) and 50 pmol of each primer. The first cycle was run as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and synthesis at 72 °C for 30 s. The next cycles were run using the same conditions except that the denaturation time was 30 s and the synthesis time of the last cycle was 7 min. Oligonucleotides for VpreB3 expression analysis were: sense primer, 5′-CTCTTCCTCTGCTCCTGGATCCTAC-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-AGAAATAGCGACCGTTGTCTTCCTC-3′. Sense primer, 5′-TGACGTGCAGCAGGAACACTATAAA-3′, and anti-sense primer, 5′-TGAGATGATAACACGCTTAGCACCA-3′, were used for the Gapdh control. Identification of a VpreB3 Orthologous Gene in Chicken—A chicken cDNA coding for a protein product with strong similarities to human and mouse VpreB3 was found by performing a Blast search on EST sequence databases using the VpreB3 protein as a query sequence. This 0.6-kb-long chicken cDNA (GenBank™ accession no. AJ395785) is likely to be full-length because it grossly corresponds to the size of the corresponding mRNA detected by Northern blot hybridization (data not shown). The 125-amino acids-long chicken VpreB3 protein shows 50 and 55% amino acid identity with the mouse and human Vpre3 proteins, respectively (Fig. 1A). It has only 40% identity with chicken IgLC variable domains (not shown). All three known VpreB3 proteins have a characteristic sequence feature (“signature”) made of three invariant residues (His-96, Ala-98, Cys-99) in the FR3-like region that are not found in any other Ig-related polypeptides (Fig. 1A). Another Blast search using the chicken cDNA as the query sequence found the sequence of the chicken VpreB3 gene and surrounding locus (GenBank™ accession no. AF079888). This gene has an evolutionarily conserved two-exon structure that codes for the signal peptide and V-like region, respectively, and lies 3.4 kb upstream of the VL pseudogene cluster that contributes to light chain diversity through a gene conversion mechanism (Fig. 1B). The VpreB3 gene is in the same transcriptional orientation as the unique functional VL-JL segment. We examined VpreB3 mRNA expression by PCR amplification in the chicken DT40 B cells and in various chick tissues at the time of hatching. Expression was detected in DT40 cells and in the bursa of Fabricius but not in other tissues (Fig. 1C). Note that the larger band seen in liver was because of the amplification of contaminating genomic DNA. Because the bursa of Fabricius is a site of diversification and expansion of B cells expressing IgM at their surface, we further used the IgM+ DT40 cells to gain insight into the functional role of the VpreB3 protein. VpreB3 Glycoprotein Binds IgLC in DT40 Cells—To characterize the chicken VpreB3 protein and interacting partners, we generated DT40 clones that express a Myc epitope-tagged version of the VpreB3 protein as well as control clones transfected with an empty expression vector. There was no evidence that VpreB3 overexpression affects IgM surface expression. Rather, DT40 clones showed low scale heterogeneity in their IgM surface expression, likely because of ongoing immunoglobulin gene diversification by gene conversion (23Buerstedde J.M. Reynaud C.A. Humphries E.H. Olson W. Ewert D.L. Weill J.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Therefore, in subsequent experiments we compared VpreB3-overexpressing cells (Vp) to control cells (C) showing similar IgM staining patterns, e.g. Vp7 versus C2 and Vp21 versus C3 (Fig. 2A). After radioactive metabolic labeling of transfected cells and immunoprecipitation using anti-Myc Ab, the 16.5-kDa VpreB3 product coprecipitated with a 28-kDa protein with the same electrophoretic mobility and endoH sensitivity as IgLC (Fig. 2B). In addition, a band at the same 16.5-kDa molecular mass as VpreB3 was found in anti-IgLC immunoprecipitates and, to a much lower extent, in anti-IgμHC immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2, B and C). A major fraction of VpreB3 showed a 3-kDa decrease in size after treatment with endoH (Fig. 2, B and C), thereby demonstrating that it was mainly a high mannose-containing glycoprotein located in the ER. However, a significant VpreB3 fraction showed resistance to endoH digestion, suggesting that it could be transported into and mature in the Golgi apparatus (see below). As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, Golgi-processed endoH-resistant mature forms of IgLC and IgμHC decreased in VpreB3-overexpressing cells compared with control transfectants. VpreB3 is thus an IgLC-binding protein that may negatively regulate maturation of BCR chains. VpreB3 Weakly Associates with IgμHC—Our experiments indicated that coimmunoprecipitation of IgμHC with VpreB3 was not detected in anti-Myc immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2B) and detected at a very low level in anti-IgμHC immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2, B and C). The lack of detection of IgμHC in anti-Myc immunoprecipitate was also observed in Vp21 cells and in two additional independent experiments in Vp7 cells (data not shown). To unambiguously determine the capacity of VpreB3 to associate with IgμHC, similar experiments were conducted in IgLC-deficient (VJL–/–) DT40 cells expressing Myc-tagged VpreB3. Immunoprecipitations on lysates from metabolically labeled cells showed that IgμHC was detected in anti-Myc immunoprecipitates, albeit at a low level (Fig. 3). In addition, VpreB3 was still detected in anti-IgμHC immunoprecipitates from VJL–/– DT40 cells overexpressing VpreB3. VpreB3 had thus a low capacity to bind IgμHC in the absence of competing IgLC. VpreB3 Forms Covalent Heterodimers with IgLC—The presence of an evolutionarily conserved extra cysteine (Cys-99) in the VpreB3 signature (Fig. 1A) prompted us to look for a possible covalent association between VpreB3 and IgLC. A two-dimension gel analysis of anti-IgLC and anti-Myc immunoprecipitates from DT40 cells expressing VpreB3-Myc (Vp7 cells) showed a fraction of VpreB3 at 16.5 kDa and IgLC proteins at 30 kDa migrating off the diagonal (Fig. 4). Their identical electrophoretic mobility (corresponding to a 46-kDa complex) in the first dimension is consistent with the existence of covalent VpreB3-IgLC heterodimers. Unexpectedly, mutation of Cys-99 to a glycine residue did not inhibit the formation of this covalent complex (data not shown). The latter observation raises the possibility that the cysteine residues usually involved in the stabilization of Ig-like domains (Cys-42 and -116 in Vpreb3) may participate in interchain disulfide bonds in VpreB3-IgLC heterodimers. Prominent Localization of VpreB3 in the ER—The localization of the VpreB3-Myc protein was delineated by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy using anti-Myc monoclonal Ab together with fluorophore-conjugated concavalin A or ceramide to label the ER or Golgi compartment, respectively. Fig. 5 shows that VpreB3 was predominantly localized in the ER. However, small areas of superimposed anti-Myc and Golgi-specific staining confirmed that a small fraction of VpreB3 was present in the Golgi compartment. These results are in agreement with the observation that most but not all of the VpreB3 proteins are sensitive to endoH digestion (Fig. 2, B and C), thus confirming that a fraction of the VpreB3 protein pool can exit the ER to mature in the Golgi apparatus. Maturation and Secretion of VpreB3-containing Complexes— Pulse-chase analysis of VpreB3-containing anti-Myc immunoprecipitates from Vp7 cells showed no evidence of VpreB3 binding partners in addition to IgLC (Fig. 6A). Clearly, the half-lives of IgLC and VpreB3 in anti-Myc (Fig. 6A) immunoprecipitates were quite similar (∼1 h 20 min), indicating that a pool of IgLC was stably associated to VpreB3 and degraded together at the same rate. IgLC associated with VpreB3 were totally sensitive to endoH digestion, demonstrating that VpreB3·IgLC complexes are confined to the ER. In addition to the endoH-sensitive form of VpreB3 at 16.5 kDa reported above (see Fig. 2), an additional digestion-resistant VpreB3 product was observed at 18 kDa at 30 and 60 min of chase. A similar VpreB3 product was also evident in VpreB3-Myc-expressing VJL–/– DT40 mutant cells (Fig. 6B). An anti-Myc reactive VpreB3 product of 18 but not 16.5 kDa was detected in the culture medium of VpreB3-Myc expressing cells but not of the corresponding control cells (Fig. 6C). In contrast to the major intracellular 16.5-kDa VpreB3 isoform, this 18-kDa VpreB3 protein was fully resistant to endoH, confirming that it had been processed through the Golgi apparatus to be secreted (Fig. 6D). Secreted VpreB3 proteins were not associated with IgLC (data not shown). Therefore, a fraction of VpreB3 with unique post-translational modification(s) is able to mature through the Golgi and exit the cell in the absence of companion IgLC. VpreB3 Overexpression Affects the Kinetics of IgLC·IgμHC Complex Maturation at the ER to Golgi Transition—Experiments shown in Fig. 2 have pointed out a possible negative effect of VpreB3 overexpression on the maturation of immunoglobulin chains. Indeed, the amount of mature IgLC was reduced 60% in Vp7 compared with C2 cells and reduced 90% in Vp21 compared with C3 cells. Therefore, the fate of newly synthesized Ig chains was investigated by anti-IgLC immunoprecipitation after pulse-chase labeling. It clearly showed that acquisition of endoH resistance by Ig chains was decreased in VpreB3-overexpressing Vp7 cells compared with C2 control cells (Fig. 7A). This was more evident in the case of IgLC for which maturation was 80–85% decreased at the first three time points analyzed (see quantification in Fig. 7B). The maturation of the IgμHC was delayed rather than quantitatively affected, as shown by the appearance of endoH-resistant form at 30 and 60 min in control and VpreB3-overexpressing cells, respectively. The effect of VpreB3 on IgLC intracellular transport and maturation was further confirmed by confocal microscopy. Fig. 7C shows that a large amount of IgLC was localized in the Golgi in C2 control cells. In contrast, Golgi-localized IgLC were barely detected in VpreB3-overexpressing Vp7 cells. Thus, overexpression of VpreB3 in DT40 cells negatively affects the transit of IgM components, mostly IgLC, from the ER to the Golgi. VpreB3 Overexpression Inhibits the Secretion of Free IgLC— Excess free IgLC are rapidly secreted in the culture medium of DT40 cells (not shown). Because VpreB3 overexpression affects IgLC transit in the ER/Golgi secretory pathway, an effect of VpreB3 on IgLC secretion may be expected. Indeed, VpreB3 overexpression affected free IgLC secretion because we observed a reduction or absence of IgLC in culture supernatants from Vp7 and Vp21 compared with C2 and C3 cells, respectively (Fig. 8). These results demonstrate that VpreB3 overexpression can retain in the ER some free IgLC that are prone to be secreted. The characterization of an orthologous chicken gene suggests a role for VpreB3 in B cell development throughout evolution. Conserved linkage of VpreB3 to the light chain gene locus in chicken and human (20Rosnet O. Mattei M.G. Delattre O. Schiff C. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1999; 87: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) indicates that it may have evolved from an ancestral, possibly germ line-joined, IgLC gene. Our failure to find sequences homologous to VpreB3 in the nearly fully sequenced genome of the bony fish Fugu rubripes argues for an emergence of an ancestral VpreB3 gene between 300 and 400 million years ago, between the radiation of the ray-finned fishes and the reptiles/birds phyla. At this time, junctional and combinatorial diversity in Ig genes was already established (24Litman G.W. Anderson M.K. Rast J.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 109-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), suggesting that VpreB3 emergence did not depend on a striking change during evolution of the adaptative immune system. When VpreB3 was first observed in mouse pre-B cells as a partner of IgμHC, it was proposed to play a role in IgμHC transport in the context of pre-BCR formation (19Shirasawa T. Ohnishi K. Hagiwara S. Shigemoto K. Takebe Y. Rajewsky K. Takemori T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1827-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21Ohnishi K. Takemori T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28347-28353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mouse and human, the IgH locus is usually rearranged before the κ and λ LC loci, and B cell development depends on the expression of a pre-BCR at the pre-B cell stage (8Martensson I.L. Rolink A. Melchers F. Mundt C. Licence S. Shimizu T. Semin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast, immunoglobulin heavy and light chain gene rearrangements occur simultaneously during a 10-day window during embryonic development in chicken (25Masteller E.L. Pharr G.T. Funk P.E. Thompson C.B. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 185-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26Reynaud C.A. Bertocci B. Dahan A. Weill J.C. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 57: 353-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, there is no need for a pre-BCR-dependent developmental checkpoint. In accordance with this view, we did not find sequences homologous to the VpreB or λ5 pre-BCR-coding genes in chicken genomic and EST databases. Because VpreB3 is expressed in the bursa of Fabricius by the time of hatching (Fig. 1), in which nearly all lymphocytes are surface IgM-positive (25Masteller E.L. Pharr G.T. Funk P.E. Thompson C.B. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1997;"
https://openalex.org/W2082760541,"Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) is highly inducible in a subset of astrocytes in vivo following ischemic or mechanical injury and in vitro by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interleukin-1β. We have studied the mechanism of induction, and found that transcriptional activation of CYP2E1 occurred within 3 h, and CYP2E1 dependent catalytic activity was induced more than 4-fold within 5 h. The induction was sensitive to several tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and was further modulated by inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase. MAP kinase kinase-3 (MKK3) was phosphorylated in response to LPS, and expression of constitutively active MKK3, but not the MAP kinase kinases MEKK1 or MKK1, activated CYP2E1. Transcriptional activation was mediated through a C/EBPβ and -δ binding element situated at –486/–474, and appeared to involve activation of prebound factors as well as recruitment of newly synthesized C/EBPβ and -δ. It is thus suggested that LPS induces MKK3 activation in astrocytes, which in turn stimulates a C/EBPβ and -δ binding element to mediate transcriptional activation of CYP2E1.

CYP2E1 is a member of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) gene superfamily and is active in the oxidation of fatty acids and ketones. CYP2E1 has a key role in gluconeogenesis as the pathway of formation of lactate or glucose from the ketone body acetone is initiated by CYP2E1, and it has been shown that the pathway contributes 5–10% of gluconeogenetic demands (1Casazza J.P. Felver M.E. Veech R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 231-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Johansson I. Eliasson E. Norsten C. Ingelman-Sundberg M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 196: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The pathway is physiologically relevant as acetone levels are highly elevated in Cyp2E1 null mice compared with wild type, during fasting (3Bondoc F.Y. Bao Z. Hu W.Y. Gonzalez F.J. Wang Y. Yang C.S. Hong J.Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 461-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition to acetone, CYP2E1 accepts numerous pharmaceuticals as substrates including neuroactive agents such as chlorzoxazone, a centrally acting muscle relaxant, and general anesthetics. In the absence of substrate, CYP2E1 can still be reduced and produce superoxide anions that may in turn contribute to oxidative stress in the cell (4Ekström G. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 1313-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 5Tindberg N. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4499-4504Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The property of oxygen radical generation is likely also the background to the contribution of CYP2E1 to apoptotic cell injury in hepatic and glial cell lines (6Chen Q. Galleano M. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14532-14541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 7Bae M. Pie J. Song B.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 847-856PubMed Google Scholar). Although expression levels of CYP2E1 are highest in the liver, CYP2E1 is expressed also in the lung and kidney as well as in the central nervous system of rats and humans. In the brain CYP2E1 is constitutively expressed, e.g. in hippocampal pyramid neurons, cortical astrocytes, and endothelial cells (8Hansson T. Tindberg N. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Köhler C. Neuroscience. 1990; 34: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and the enzyme has been found to be inducible and catalytically active in the brain (9Warner M. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1019-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 10Montoliu C. Sancho-Tello M. Azorin I. Burgal M. Valles S. Renau-Piqueras J. Guerri C. J.

Several cytochrome P450 members of families 1 to 4 are highly responsive to inflammatory mediators. Hepatic expression of CYP1A, CYP2B, CYP2C, CYP2E, and CYP3A members is significantly repressed by, e.g. lipopolysaccharide, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor α, and interferons α and β, often between 40 and 95% (12Abdel-Razzak Z.

Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Morgan E.T. Thomas K.B. Swansson R. Vales T. Hwang J. Wright K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of down-regulation of hepatic P450s in response to inflammatory stimuli are not completely clear, but may be specific for each P450, and for different stimuli. It has, e.g. been found that sphingomyelin hydrolysis may mediate CYP2C11 down-regulation by interleukin-1β (15Chen J. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Merrill Jr., A.H. Morgan E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25233-25238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), that the C/EBPβ mRNA-derived liver-enriched inhibitory protein down-regulates CYP3A4 in response to interleukin-6 (16Jover R. Bort R. Gómez-Lechón M.J. Castell J.V. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1799-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and that the decreased availability of the transcription factor HNF-1α is likely important for the down-regulation of CYP2E1 in response to interleukin-1β (17Hakkola J. Hu Y. Ingelman-Sundberg M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast to the down-regulation of hepatic CYP2E1 by inflammatory factors, CYP2E1 has been shown to be highly inducible during inflammation both in vivo and in vitro in astrocytes. CYP2E1 is readily inducible in astrocytes in vivo following mechanical injury to the rat central nervous system (8Hansson T. Tindberg N. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Köhler C. Neuroscience. 1990; 34: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), or following ischemic injury in the gerbil or in the rat (18Tindberg N. Baldwin H.A. Cross A.J. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1065-1072PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, CYP2E1 was found to be highly responsive to lipopolysaccharide and interleukin-1β in cultured astrocytes, and to a lesser extent to interleukin-6 (18Tindberg N. Baldwin H.A. Cross A.J. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1065-1072PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, both in vivo and in culture, CYP2E1 is induced in and restricted to a subset of glial fibrillary acidic protein positive (GFAP+) astrocytes, corresponding to ∼8% of the cells (8Hansson T. Tindberg N. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Köhler C. Neuroscience. 1990; 34: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 18Tindberg N. Baldwin H.A. Cross A.J. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1065-1072PubMed Google Scholar, 19Tindberg N. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 888-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A few other P450s are now known to be induced, rather than down-regulated, during inflammation, as exemplified by the induction of CYP4A3 in hepatocytes from certain rat strains (20Sewer M.B. Koop D.R. Morgan E.T. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1996; 24: 401-407PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was recently found that CYP4F4 and 4F5 were induced in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, in the inflammatory phase following traumatic brain injury (21Cui X. Kalsotra A. Robida A.M. Matzilevich D. Moore A.N. Boehme C.L. Morgan E.T. Dash P.K. Strobel H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1619: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The mechanisms remain, however, unknown. The previously described induction of CYP2E1 by lipopolysaccharide in astrocytes (18Tindberg N. Baldwin H.A. Cross A.J. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1065-1072PubMed Google Scholar) involved an increase in CYP2E1 mRNA, an unusual mode of induction for CYP2E1, and was sensitive to transcriptional inhibitors such as actinomycin D. We have now studied the mechanism of induction and present evidence for the rapid, transcriptional induction of CYP2E1 through a pathway involving MKK3-dependent stimulation of a C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ binding element at –486/–474. Primary Cortical Glial Cultures—Rat primary cortical glial cultures were established from cortices of newborn rats (6–12 h) as previously described (18Tindberg N. Baldwin H.A. Cross A.J. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1065-1072PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were grown in minimum essential medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, amino acids, vitamins, penicillin (250,000 IU/liter), and streptomycin (250 mg/liter) (all medias were from Invitrogen). The cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide at 90–95% confluence. Protein kinase inhibitors were added 30 min before stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; CZN, chlorzoxazone; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ANOVA, analysis of variance; MKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; C/EBP, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein. Cell cultures were analyzed with microscopy for the composition of cells, and the expression of CYP2E1 and luciferase protein. The cells were verified to consist of ∼85% astrocytes and ∼3% microglial cells, as previously described (18Tindberg N. Baldwin H.A. Cross A.J. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1065-1072PubMed Google Scholar, 22Simi A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Tindberg N. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2000; 20: 1077-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In a similar manner CYP2E1 was verified to be induced in a subset of cells, as previously described (18Tindberg N. Baldwin H.A. Cross A.J. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1065-1072PubMed Google Scholar). pGL3-reporter transfected cells, using DMRIE-C, were found to express luciferase protein in GFAP+ cells. For microscopy, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and subsequently incubated with polyclonal antisera prepared from rabbits immunized with purified rat liver CYP2E1 (18Tindberg N. Baldwin H.A. Cross A.J. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1065-1072PubMed Google Scholar), or with luciferase antisera or preimmune sera. In other experiments, cells were incubated with antibodies reactive toward glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, Dakopatts A/S, Denmark) or CD11b (BIOSOURCE Intl.). Secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibodies (Sigma) or TRITC-labeled antibodies (Roche Applied Science) were used. All experiments involving the establishment of primary cortical glial cultures were approved by the ethical committee at Karolinska Institute. Preparation of Microsomal Fractions—After harvest of the rat primary cortical glial cultures, the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and subsequently sonicated in 5 volumes of ice-cold 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, with 20% glycerol, 1.14% (w/v) KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and, freshly dissolved, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 20 μm butylated hydroxytoluene. Centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × g gave a nuclear and mitochondrial pellet, which was washed once. The supernatants were combined and centrifuged (100,000 × g) for 60 min to give a microsomal pellet. The pellets were dissolved in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and were stored at –70 °C. Chlorzoxazone 6-Hydroxylation Assay—The 6-hydroxylation of chlorzoxazone (CZN) was monitored to detect CYP2E1-dependent catalytic activity. One mg of microsomal protein was incubated with 500 μm CZN and 0.5 mm NADPH in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, for 120 min. NADPH was added every 30 min, and the reaction was linear up to at least 150 min. After termination of the incubations with 43% o-phosphoric acid, internal standard (1 μg of paracetamol/acetaminophen or 5 μg of 5-fluorbenzoxazoline-2-one) was added to the incubations. After extraction twice with dichloromethane and evaporation to dryness under N2, the residue was dissolved in 50 μl of mobile phase. The products of CZN oxidation were analyzed on a Millipore/Waters 510 HPLC system, on a Hibar prepacked column RT 250-4 (Merck, Germany). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile, 0.5% phosphoric acid (22:78), at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The effluent was detected by a Millipore/Waters 480 LC spectrophotometer (at 250 nm for paracetamol/acetaminophen detection) and simultaneously by a LC-4A amperometric detector (Bioanalytical Systems Inc.), for sensitive analysis of the product 6-OH-chlorzoxazone. There was a potential of 1.3 volts over the electrochemical detector cell. The sensitivity for detection of 6-OH-CZN was determined to 0.5 pmol. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts were isolated and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was carried out as previously described (22Simi A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Tindberg N. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2000; 20: 1077-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the binding reaction, 5–50 fmol of DNA labeled with [γ-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) was incubated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 14% glycerol, and 150 mm NaCl with 5–10 μg of nuclear extract. Antibody interference assay was carried out by incubation with 2 or 4 μg of antibody, specifically directed to individual C/EBP factors or nuclear factor κB (NFκB) factors (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). CYP2E1 sequences of oligonucleotides used in EMSA were taken from Umeno et al. (23Umeno M. Song B.J. Kozak C. Gelboin H.V. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4956-4962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The –492/–466 oligonucleotide has the following sequence: 5′-TGCTCTCATTTTCCAAACAGGCCATT-3′. The same –492/–466 oligo, but with introduced mutations, has the following sequence: 5′-TGCTCTCATGTTCAGAGCAGGCCATT-3′, and the consensus C/EBP binding oligonucleotide has the following sequence: 5′-TGCAGATTGCGCAATCTGCA-3′. The consensus NFκB oligonucleotide has the following sequence: 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′. Construction of Plasmids—The reporter gene constructs were prepared by amplifying the targeted 5′ regulatory fragments with PCR (23Umeno M. Song B.J. Kozak C. Gelboin H.V. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4956-4962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hu Y. Hakkola J. Oscarson M. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and cloning into pGL3-Basic plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) in front of a luciferase reporter gene using BglII and HindIII sites. The mutated pGL3-CYP2E1(–489-+28) plasmid carried the same four mutations as the –492/–466 CYP2E1 oligonucleotide described above. The correct identity of the constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. Expression plasmids for constitutively active MAP kinase kinases MEKK1 (pFC-MEKK1), MKK1 (pFC-MKK1), and MKK3 (pFC-MKK3), the GAL4-CHOP (C/EBP homology protein) plasmid, as well as the GAL4-UAS luciferase reporter were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The pCMV-C/EBPα, -β, and -δ expression plasmids and the dominant negative C/EBPβ expression plasmid have been previously described (25Nord M. Lag M. Cassel T.N. Randmark M. Becher R. Barnes H.J. Schwarze P.E. Gustafsson J.A. Lund J. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 26Cassel T. Nordlund-Möller L. Andersson O. Gustafsson J.A. Nord M. Am. J. Respir.

Transient Transfection Assay—Primary cortical glial cultures were transiently transfected as previously described (22Simi A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Tindberg N. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2000; 20: 1077-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to 70–80% confluence and were then transfected with the cationic lipid transfection reagent DMRIE-C (Invitrogen). If no other quantity is given in the figure legends, 0.5 μg of pGL3 plasmid, 0.5 μg of pCMV-C/EBP plasmid, and/or 25 ng of pFC-MEKK1/pFC-MKK1/pFC-MKK3 was transfected to each well in 12-well plates (℘ 22 mm). Except for the pGL3 firefly luciferase plasmid, a Renilla luciferase control plasmid was co-transfected. Medium was changed after 6–12 h, to normal growth medium, and cells were then harvested at around 48 h following transfection. Cell stimulation with 100 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide took place in growth medium. Using an antibody to the Firefly luciferase protein in microscopy, it was confirmed that GFAP+ astrocytes were transfected with this procedure. For analysis of 6-OH-CZN formation, larger quantities of cells were needed. Large plates (℘ 139 mm) with cortical glial cells 85% confluent were transfected with 4–17 μg of pFC-MEKK1, pFC-MKK3, or empty plasmid DNA, using DM-RIE-C (35 μl) and 35 ml of Opti-MEM medium. The cells were incubated with the cationic lipid:DNA mixtures for 6 h, then kept for 48 h in normal growth medium and harvested. Microsomal fractions and chlorzoxazone assay were carried out as described above. GAL4-CHOP and GAL4-luciferase plasmid transfections were carried out as previously described (28Tindberg N. Porsmyr-Palmertz M. Simi A. Neurochem. Res. 2000; 25: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—30 μg of cell extract protein from primary cortical glial cultures was subjected to 8.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The filters were, after transfer of proteins, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, dried, and blocked in 5% dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% Tween 20 (TBS-Tween) overnight at +4 °C. The filters were then incubated with MKK3 or phospho-MKK3/6 antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), diluted 1/1000 in TBS-Tween with 5% milk, washed three times, and incubated for 120 min with a horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Dakopatts A/S, Denmark) diluted 1/1000 in TBS-Tween with 5% milk. After thorough washing in TBS-Tween (5 × 30 min in large volumes), proteins were visualized with enhanced luminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Molecular weight standards used for molecular weight estimations were from Bio-Rad. Data Analysis—Results are presented as mean ± S.D., and statistically analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer's multiple comparisons post-test. The GraphPad Instat program version 3.0 for Windows 95 (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA) was used for calculations. Materials—SB203580, lavendustin A, genistein, and daidzein were obtained from Calbiochem. Water soluble SB203580 was used as organic solvents may affect CYP2E1 activity. Lipopolysaccharide, wortmannin, and paracetamol/acetaminophen reference standards were from Sigma, and were dissolved and used according to instructions with the products. Chlorzoxazone was purchased from Aldrich, and 5-chloro-6-hydroxy-2-benzoxazoline (6-OH-CZN) was obtained from McNeil Chemical Co., PA. 5-Fluorbenzoxazoline-2-one was a kind gift from Dr. Raimund Peter, University of Erlangen, Germany. Antibodies to C/EBP and NFκB proteins were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Lipopolysaccharide-dependent Induction of CYP2E1 in Cortical Glial Cells—We have previously found the 6-hydroxylation of CZN in LPS-treated cortical glial cells to be catalyzed by CYP2E1 to a very large extent (11Tindberg N. Ingelman-Sundberg M. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2066-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18Tindberg N. Baldwin H.A. Cross A.J. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1065-1072PubMed Google Scholar, 19Tindberg N. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 888-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and therefore to be a good and sensitive measure of functional CYP2E1 expression. A detailed analysis of the time course of induction of 6-hydroxylation of CZN in cortical glial cells in response to LPS revealed that formation of 6-OH-CZN was increased more than 4-fold within 5 h, and that a 6–7-fold induction was seen at 8–24hof LPS exposure (Fig. 1A). The 6-hydroxylation of CZN was inhibited by CYP2E1 antisera, but not preimmune sera, to ∼85% (not shown), as we have described in previous reports (11Tindberg N. Ingelman-Sundberg M. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2066-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18Tindberg N. Baldwin H.A. Cross A.J. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1065-1072PubMed Google Scholar, 19Tindberg N. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 888-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Thus, LPS appears to cause a rapid and potent induction of functional CYP2E1. Inducible expression of CYP2E1 in cells of the central nervous system in vivo and in vitro, in response to injury, inflammatory factors, or phorbol esters, appears restricted to GFAP+ astrocytes (8Hansson T. Tindberg N. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Köhler C. Neuroscience. 1990; 34: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 11Tindberg N. Ingelman-Sundberg M. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2066-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18Tindberg N. Baldwin H.A. Cross A.J. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1065-1072PubMed Google Scholar, 19Tindberg N. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 888-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore, a plasmid transfectional protocol was developed whereby GFAP+ astrocytes, in cortical glial cultures, were transfected by cationic lipids. With this protocol, cortical glial cultures were transfected with a pGL3-CYP2E1 plasmid, containing ∼3.7 kb of CYP2E1 5′ flank in front of the luciferase reporter. Stimulation with LPS gave 2–2.5-fold induction of luciferase activity, evident from 3 h of LPS treatment and more pronounced from4hon (Fig. 1, B and C). Using a number of pGL3-CYP2E1 deletion constructs (25Nord M. Lag M. Cassel T.N. Randmark M. Becher R. Barnes H.J. Schwarze P.E. Gustafsson J.A. Lund J. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the LPS effect was found to depend on the CYP2E1 5′ flank sequence upstream of –418 (Fig. 1C). Induction of 6-Hydroxylation of CZN by LPS Is Inhibited by Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors—Because LPS signaling may involve tyrosine phosphorylation events, a number of proteintyrosine kinase inhibitors were tested. The general tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein gave a dose-dependent inhibition of the induction of 6-OH-CZN formation by LPS (Fig. 2A). Whereas 100 μm genistein caused a nearly complete inhibition of the induction by LPS (Fig. 2A), the inactive analogue daidzein was at 100 μm nearly without inhibitory effect (Table I). In contrast to genistein, herbimycin A displays a more restricted pattern of tyrosine kinase inhibition, which includes inhibition of the phosphorylation of MKK3 and p38 MAP kinase (29Han J. Lee J.D. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25009-25014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Pandey P. Avraham S. Kumar S. Nakazawa A. Place A. Ghanem L. Rana A. Kumar V.

Herbimycin A inhibited the LPS-dependent induction of the formation of 6-OH-CZN to a very large extent, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). A third protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin AG126, gave a partial inhibition, whereas a fourth inhibitor, lavendustin A, was without inhibitory effect (Table I).Table IEffect of kinase inhibitors on the inducibility of 6-hydroxylation of CZN, by LPS, in cortical glial culturesCompoundMaximal inhibitionConcentrationGenistein97%100 μmDaidzein4%100 μmHerbimycin A85%0.8 μg/mlTyrphostin AG12634%50 μmLavendustin A0%10 μmWortmannin5%100 nmDexametason0%1 μm Open table in a new tab Effect of p38 MAP Kinase Inhibitors on the Induction of 6-Hydroxylation of CZN by LPS—We have previously found that LPS stimulates p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation and activity in the cortical glial cells (22Simi A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Tindberg N. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2000; 20: 1077-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have also characterized the neuroprotective agent chlomethiazole as an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase activity (22Simi A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Tindberg N. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2000; 20: 1077-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Simi A. Porsmyr-Palmertz M. Hjerten A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Tindberg N. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), in the cortical glial cells. Addition of chlomethiazole to the cultures did inhibit the LPS-dependent induction of the rate of 6-OH-CZN formation, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C), as we have previously shown (18Tindberg N. Baldwin H.A. Cross A.J. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1065-1072PubMed Google Scholar). SB203580 is a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor specific to p38 MAP kinase α and β, which is structurally distinct from chlomethiazole, and that has a different mechanism of action (22Simi A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Tindberg N. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2000; 20: 1077-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 32Eyers P.A. van den Ijssel P. Quinlan R.A. Goedert M. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Addition of low concentrations of SB203580 to the cultures was found to significantly increase the induction of the rate of 6-hydroxylation of CZN in response to LPS, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). MAP Kinase Kinase-3 Is Phosphorylated by LPS and Activates pGL3-CYP2E1—As the inducibility of 6-hydroxylation of CZN was modulated by inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase, the pGL3-CYP2E1 containing 3.6 kb of 5′ flank was cotransfected to cortical glial cells with small amounts of plasmids for expression of constitutively active kinases stimulating MAP kinases. MEKK-1, stimulating the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway, and MKK1, stimulating the extracellular signal-regulated MAP kinase pathways had no or negligible effect on pGL3-CYP2E1 luciferase activity (Fig. 3A). In contrast, expression of constitutively active MKK3 stimulated pGL3-CYP2E1 luciferase activity at low concentrations, and with higher potency at increasing concentrations (Fig. 3, A and B). As was found for the LPS effect on pGL3-CYP2E1 deletion plasmids (Fig. 1C), MKK3 expression only resulted in increased luciferase activity if the pGL3-CYP2E1 plasmid contained the CYP2E1 sequence to at least –489 base pairs upstream of the initiation site (Fig. 3C). Analysis of the CYP2E1 sequence revealed a putative C/EBP binding site at –486 to –474 (Transfac software; Ref. 33Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A. Kolpakov F.A. Podkolodny N.L. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 364-370Crossref Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Several new pGL3-CYP2E1 plasmids were thus constructed, and it was found that mutation of this site, or deletion of the CYP2E1 sequence 3′ of the putative element (at –466) abolished the stimulatory effect of MKK3 expression (Fig. 3C). Constitutively active MKK3, encoded by pFC-MKK3, was also verified to be functionally active in the cortical glial cultures. The activation of the transcription factor CHOP, an indirect MKK3 target through the p38 MAP kinase (34Wang X.Z. Ron D. Science. 1996; 272: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar) was assayed through the activation of a GAL4/CHOP construct, and a dose-dependent activation of CHOP was noted in response to MKK3 (Fig. 4C). MKK3 was originally isolated from the central nervous system (35Dérijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar), and by using a highly specific antisera to MKK3, we detected a band with the expected mobility in cell extracts from cortical glial cells (Fig. 4A, left panel). Stimulation of cortical glial cells with LPS, for 30 min, induced a band reacting with highly specific anti-phosphoantibodies to MKK3/6, with the expected mobility (Fig. 4A, right panel). Because expression of MKK3 was found to stimulate transcription from the CYP2E1 –486/–474 element, we analyzed the ability of expressed MKK3 and MEKK1 to stimulate CYP2E1-dependent catalytic activity: 6-hydroxylation of chlorzoxazone. It was found that MKK3, but not MEKK1, transfected to the cortical glial cells induced an increase in the rate of formation of 6-OH-CZN, as shown in Fig. 4B. The Element at –486/–474 Binds C/EBPβ and -δ—To analyze the element at –486/–474 found to be sensitive to LPS and MKK3 expression, EMSA with antibody interference analysis was used. Protein complexes were found to bind to the oligo"

The three-dimensional structure at 1.85 A, presented here, shows that the sequence joining the two modules is disordered, confirming that linker sequences in modular glycoside hydrolases are highly flexible. CjXyn10C hydrolyzes xylan at a rate similar to other previously described GH10 enzymes but displays very low activity against xylooligosaccharides. The poor activity on short substrates reflects weak binding at the -2 subsite of the enzyme. Comparison of CjXyn10C with other family GH10 enzymes reveals polymorphisms in the substrate binding cleft including a glutamate/glycine substitution at the -2 subsite and a tyrosine insertion in the -2/-3 glycone region of the substrate binding cleft, both of which contribute to the unusual properties of the enzyme. The CjXyn10C-substrate complex shows that Tyr-340 stacks against the xylose residue located at the -3 subsite, and the properties of Y340A support the view that this tyrosine plays a pivotal role in substrate binding at this location. The generic importance of using CjXyn10C as a template in predicting the biochemical properties of GH10 xylanases is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2057529032,"Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays are used to map H3 and H4 acetylation over the promoter nucleosomes and the coding region of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SUC2 gene, under repressed and derepressed conditions, using wild type and mutant strains. In wild type cells, a high level of H3 acetylation at the distal end of the promoter drops sharply toward the proximal nucleosome that covers the TATA box, a gradient that become even steeper on derepression. In contrast, substantial H4 acetylation shows no such gradient and extends into the coding region. Overall levels of both H3 and H4 acetylation rise on derepression. Mutation of GCN5 or SNF2 lead to substantially reduced SUC2 expression; in gnc5 there is no reduction in basal H3 acetylation, but large reductions occur on derepression. SNF2 mutation has little effect on H3 acetylation, so SAGA and SWI/SNF recruitment seem to be independent events. H4 acetylation is little affected by either GCN5 or SNF2 mutation. In a double snf2/gcn5 mutant (very low SUC2 expression), H3 acetylation is at the minimal level, but H4 acetylation remains largely unaffected. Transcription is thus linked to H3 but not H4 acetylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that Tup1p is evenly distributed over the four promoter nucleosomes in repressed wild type cells but redistributes upstream on derepression, a movement probably linked to its conversion from a repressor to an activator.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae SUC2 gene codes for invertase, an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of sucrose and raffinose to provide the cell with glucose in the absence of this essential fuel. It has been widely used to study the mechanisms underlying glucose regulation in yeast. Because these mechanisms result in changes in chromatin structure, this has been a long-lasting field of research. We first analyzed the DNase I sensitivity of the SUC2 gene (1Pérez-Ortín J.E. Estruch F. Matallana E. Franco L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 205: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) as well as nucleosome positioning under repressing and derepressing conditions, in both wild type cells (2Pérez-Ortín J.E. Estruch F. Matallana E. Franco L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6937-6956Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and in regulatory mutants (3Matallana E. Franco L. Pérez-Ortín J.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 231: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These initial data, obtained by indirect end labeling, showed that four nucleosomes are positioned on the promoter in such a way that certain crucial elements, including the TATA box, are occluded, whereas other regulatory sequences are nucleosome-free (2Pérez-Ortín J.E. Estruch F. Matallana E. Franco L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6937-6956Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These results were refined by other workers (4Gavin I.M. Simpson R.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6263-6271Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 5Wu L. Winston F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4230-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) who mapped the four nucleosomes at high resolution by primer extension analysis.The SUC2 gene is repressed in the presence of glucose by the Ssn6-Tup1 corepressor complex (6Williams F.E. Trumbly R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 6500-6511Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 7Neigeborn L. Carlson M. Genetics. 1987; 115: 247-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is tethered to the promoter by Mig1p (8Treitel M.A. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3132-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Tup1-mediated repression of SUC2 results in deacetylation of histone H3 at the promoter, as shown by an increase in H3 acetylation in tup1 mutants, but a lack of Tup1p does not change the acetylation level of H4 (9Deckert J. Struhl K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 2726-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This result contrasts with findings for other Tup1-regulated genes in which the repression also results in deacetylation of H4 (9Deckert J. Struhl K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 2726-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar).The SUC2 gene is effectively derepressed by lowering the concentration of glucose (10Carlson M. Osmond B.C. Botstein D. Genetics. 1981; 98: 25-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and several genes required for derepression were identified early through genetic screening (10Carlson M. Osmond B.C. Botstein D. Genetics. 1981; 98: 25-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Neigeborn L. Carlson M. Genetics. 1984; 108: 845-858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These genes were collectively named SNF (sucrose non-fermenting). Further studies revealed that the SNF genes play two clearly different roles. The first is accomplished by the SNF1 and SNF4 genes. The former encodes a protein kinase (12Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Science. 1986; 233: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), which acts in the pathway leading to SUC2 derepression (13Carlson M. Osmond B.C. Neigeborn L. Botstein D. Genetics. 1984; 107: 19-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Snf4p regulates the kinase activity of Snf1p (14Jiang R. Carlson M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 2099-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The Snf1p kinase itself is rapidly phosphorylated in response to low glucose (15Wilson W.A. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1426-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and then, in turn, phosphorylates several proteins, including Mig1p (16Treitel M.A. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 6273-6280Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). This seems to be a signal for the nucleus to cytoplasm translocation of Mig1p (17De Vit M.J. Waddle J.A. Johnston M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1603-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), and recent results seem to indicate that protein kinase C is also involved in this process (18Salgado A.P.C. Schuller D. Casal M. Leão C. Leiper F.C. Carling D. Fietto L.G. Trópia M.J. Castro I.M. Brandão R.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Importantly, translocation of Mig1p does not result in the release of Ssn6-Tup1, which remains bound to the SUC2 promoter (19Papamichos-Chronakis M. Petrakis T. Ktistaki E. Topalidou I. Tzamarias D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1297-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The remaining SNF genes are involved in chromatin remodeling, as part of the SWI/SNF 1The abbreviations used are: SWI/SNF, mating-type switching/sucrose nonfermenting; SAGA, Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase; YPD, yeast extract-peptone-glucose; X-ChiP, cross-linking/chromatin immunoprecipitation; wt, wild type; HAT, histone acetyltransferase. 1The abbreviations used are: SWI/SNF, mating-type switching/sucrose nonfermenting; SAGA, Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase; YPD, yeast extract-peptone-glucose; X-ChiP, cross-linking/chromatin immunoprecipitation; wt, wild type; HAT, histone acetyltransferase. complex as revealed by the pioneering studies of Hirschhorn et al. (20Hirschhorn J.N. Brown S.A. Clark C.D. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2288-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar).Derepression of SUC2 also requires the action of the HAT activity of Gcn5p, as well as that of Ada2p and Ada3p (21Pollard K.J. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 6212-6222Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). These proteins are components of the SAGA complex, which functionally interacts with the remodeling SWI/SNF complex (22Roberts S.M. Winston F. Genetics. 1997; 147: 451-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The participation of SAGA, which is largely specific for H3 (23Grant P.A. Eberharter A. John S. Cook R.G. Turner B.M. Workman J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5895-5900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) in SUC2 derepression may explain observations that the level of H3 acetylation at its promoter increases in going from high to low glucose conditions (24Bone J.R. Roth S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1808-1813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Despite these data, many questions still remain concerning the mechanisms of SUC2 derepression at a chromatin level. The precise role of the Ssn6-Tup1 complex in the activation of the gene and the relative roles of H3 and H4 acetylation in the process need clarification. Finally, the nature of the interactions between the SAGA and SWI/SNF complexes in the SUC2 promoter are not yet clear. Because SUC2 stands as a paradigm among the glucose-repressed genes in yeast, the answers to these questions are particularly important.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast Strains, Plasmids, and Media—The gcn5 and ada2 deletion mutants were obtained by appropriate gene disruptions of a parental strain with the genotype MATα leu2Δ1 trp1Δ63 ura3–52, further referred to as the wild type strain. All of these strains were kindly provided by G. Thireos. They are isogenic to the FY50, FY1291, FY1312, and FY1352 strains (spt3, spt20, snf2, and gcn5snf2, respectively), which were a gift from F. Winston. To construct the gcn5ΔBr mutant, lacking the bromodomain of Gcn5p, the gcn5 deletion mutant was transformed according to the protocol of Ito et al. (25Ito J.C. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a centromeric plasmid bearing a truncated version of GCN5 (26Syntichaki P. Topalidou I. Thireos G. Nature. 2000; 404: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), which was also provided by G. Thireos.Yeast cells were grown in a standard YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 2% glucose). To derepress SUC2, cells were transferred to a YPD medium containing low glucose (0.05%). For the growth of the mutant yeast cells, the YPD medium was supplemented with the required amino acids at the following concentrations (μg/ml): lysine, 40; histidine, 20; leucine, 60; tryptophan, 40; uracil, 20.Formaldehyde Cross-linking and Chromatin immunoprecipitation— Cross-linking and immunoprecipitation of yeast chromatin was carried out by a modification of a previously published procedure (27Braunstein M. Rose A.B. Holmes S.G. Allis C.D. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Cells harvested at mid-log phase (A600 = 0.5) were transferred to a conical flask, and formaldehyde (1% final concentration) was added. Cells were fixed at room temperature for 15 min under shaking, and the reaction was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. The cross-linked yeast cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice in ice-cold buffer containing 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The pelleted cells were then resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X 100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0) supplemented with a mixture of yeast inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes (Sigma) and transferred to screw-top tubes. To homogenize the yeast cells, an equal volume of acid-washed glass beads (450–600 μm diameter) was added to each tube, and the cell suspensions were vortexed eight times at maximum speed for 1 min each. The tubes were kept on ice at least for 1 min between two consecutive vortexings. The homogenates were freed from the glass beads by washing four times with 500 μl of lysis buffer. The samples were then microfuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were discarded and the pellets resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer. To obtain soluble chromatin fractions, each sample was sonicated on ice 16 times, for 10 s each, at maximum power with a 3-mm microtip probe in a VC sonicator (Sonics & Materials, Inc.). All samples were chilled on ice for 2 min between sonications. In our hands, this sonication procedure yielded chromatin fragments with an average length of 350 bp, and fragments of more than 600 bp represented less than 15%. After sonication, the samples were microfuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellets were discarded, and the supernatants were transferred to new tubes and centrifuged as described above. The final supernatants were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C.The following antibodies were used for ChIP assays: an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody recognizing the most highly acetylated forms of histone H3 (28Myers F.A. Evans D.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20197-20205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), a polyclonal antibody specific for hyperacetylated histone H4 (29Torres L. Ávila M.A. Carretero M.V. Latasa M.U. Caballería J. López-Rodas G. Boukaba A. Lu S.C. Franco L. Mato J.M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and an affinity purified polyclonal anti-Tup1 antibody (30Redd M.J. Arnaud M.B. Johnson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11193-11197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) kindly provided by A. D. Johnson.For ChIP assays, the fixed chromatin solutions were cleared by stirring with protein A-Sepharose beads (25 μl of a 1:1 slurry) for 2 h at 4 °C. Before using, protein A-Sepharose was blocked with 0.1 μg/μl sheared λ DNA and 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin for 4 h under rotation at 4 °C. Precleared chromatin was divided into several fractions, transferred to new tubes, and incubated with 5 μl of anti-hyperacetylated histone H3 antiserum, 10 μl of the anti-hyperacetylated histone H4 antiserum, or 2 μl of anti-Tup1 antibody. Samples were rotated gently overnight at 4 °C, and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads were then added to each sample and the suspensions incubated for an additional 2 h. Beads were recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 1 min, the supernatants discarded, and the gel pellets resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer and rotated for 5 min at room temperature. Before the first washing of each sample, the supernatants from the reaction lacking primary antibodies were saved as input fractions and were processed together with the fractions eluted from the immunoprecipitates.Immunoprecipitated chromatin was eluted from protein A-Sepharose in 100 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 100 mm NaH2CO3) at 65 °C for 10 min. The beads were re-extracted once more with 100 μl of elution buffer, and both eluates were pooled. Formaldehyde cross-linking was reversed by heating the eluates at 65 °C overnight. DNA from the eluates was purified by incubation with 100 μg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 1 h, extracted with phenolchloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25/24/1), precipitated overnight at –20 °C with 3 volumes of absolute ethanol in the presence of 1/10 (v/v) 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and 20 μg of glycogen as a carrier. DNA was recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, washed twice with 70% ethanol, and dried in a SpeedVac for 5 min. The DNA obtained was then dissolved in 50 μl of TE buffer (1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and saved at –20 °C for PCR analysis. The DNA from anti-Tup1 antibody immunoprecipitate was purified using Qiagen columns according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA from all input and bound fractions was quantified with Pico Green (Molecular Probes) following the manufacturer's instructions.PCR Analysis—Before PCR analysis (in a PerkinElmer 9600 thermocycler) of the immunoprecipitated samples, the linearity range for DNA amplification was determined by serial dilutions of each input and bound fraction. This showed that for immunoprecipitates with anti-H3 and anti-H4 antibodies, 1/10000-fold dilution of the input DNA and 1/50-fold of the bound DNA fractions followed by 30 cycles of PCR were appropriate. For the anti-Tup1 antibody immunoprecipitates, a 1/10000-fold dilution of the input, a 1/100-fold dilution of the bound DNA, and 26 cycles of PCR were used. PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gels and quantified using Quantity One quantitation software (version 4, Bio Rad). The immunoprecipitation efficiency was calculated in triplicate according to Noma et al. (31Noma K. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Science. 2001; 293: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Briefly, the relative enrichment of H3 and H4 acetylation in the SUC2 gene was estimated by dividing the amount of the PCR product from immunoprecipitated samples by the amount of the input sample prior to the immunoprecipitation. These SUC2 ratios were then normalized for immunoprecipitation efficiency by dividing by the corresponding bound/input ratio for the ACT1 (actin) gene PCR product.Oligonucleotide PCR primers were designed to amplify segments within the four nucleosomes upstream of the start site of the SUC2 gene and one segment near the middle of the coding region (see Fig. 2 for details). Oligonucleotide primers for the promoter region of the ACT1 gene amplify a fragment from –156 to +45.RNA Isolation and Northern Analysis—The hot acid-phenol method (32Iyer V. Struhl K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5208-5212Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) was used to extract total RNA from 25 ml cell cultures. The RNA obtained was dissolved in sterile distilled water and its concentration was determined by measuring A260. Total RNA (25 μg) from each sample was fractionated on a 1.2% formaldehyde agarose gel and blotted into a Hybond membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary transfer. RNA was cross-linked by UV irradiation (254 nm) in a Bio-Rad apparatus. Hybridization was performed using Rapid-Hyb solution (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at70 °C. All washes were done at 65 °C. The DNA probes for hybridization corresponded to positions +85 to + 882 for SUC2 and from +124 to + 878 for ACT1. They were generated by PCR and labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP. Quantitation was performed with a FLA3000 Phosphoimager (Fujifilm) using the Image Gauge version 3.12 software.Invertase Activity Analysis—Whole yeast cells from all strains and conditions used were grown to an A600 of 0.5 and collected by centrifugation, washed twice with cold distilled water, and resuspended to a concentration of 100 mg of cells/ml. Invertase activity was determined as described by Goldstein and Lampen (33Goldstein A. Lampen J.O. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 42: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) with the modifications of Celenza and Carlson (34Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1984; 4: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The invertase activity was expressed as μmol of sucrose hydrolyzed by the enzyme per min under standard assay conditions.RESULTSRNA Expression Analysis of the SUC2 Gene in Wild Type and Mutant Strains—On shifting to low glucose concentration, SUC2 is readily induced (derepressed). This system was used to examine the time course of expression levels in wild type yeast cells and in the mutant strains gcn5, snf2, gcn5/snf2, ada2, spt3, spt20, and gcn5ΔBr.Fig. 1 (upper panel) shows the profile of SUC2 mRNA expression. Set arbitrarily to 1 under basal conditions (wt 0 h), SUC2 expression rises to 8 after 1 h in low glucose and to 20 at full derepression (2 h in low glucose). Under the same conditions, the gcn5 mutant displays a severe phenotype; there is little change in the level after 1 h in low glucose, and it increases only 5-fold at 2 h. The snf2 mutant shows a similar phenotype, which is in accordance with the involvement of SNF2 in the expression of SUC2. The transcription rate of gcn5ΔBr mutant is roughly similar to that of the gcn5 and snf2 mutants, but the double mutant gcn5/snf2 shows a very severe phenotype, and the expression of SUC2 gene is almost negligible before induction and after 2 h of induction is similar to that of the repressed wt state. To evaluate the transcriptional rate in the double mutant, a correction for the expression level of the ACT1 gene was required. In fact, an ∼3.5-fold decrease in ACT1 transcription was observed in the double mutants, in agreement with the data of Biggar and Crabtree (35Biggar S.R. Crabtree G.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2254-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The expression of ACT1 is not affected in single mutant strains, including spt3 and spt20, which means that SAGA and other Gcn5p-containing HAT complexes are not involved in this effect. The results obtained in the invertase assay with some of the above mentioned strains (Fig. 1, lower panel) are in close agreement with the data on SUC2 mRNA expression. It can thus be concluded that the expression of the SUC2 gene in low glucose occurs to a very low extent in the gcn5, snf2, gcn5/snf2, ada2, spt3, spt20, and gcn5ΔBr mutants, and therefore, a repressing chromatin state may be expected in these mutants even under derepressing conditions. This conclusion agrees with our previous results with the snf2 mutant (3Matallana E. Franco L. Pérez-Ortín J.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 231: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Fig. 1RNA expression analysis of the SUC2 gene and invertase assays. Yeast cells were grown in YPD medium under repressing conditions and then shifted to derepressing conditions. Aliquots from wt and mutant strains were taken at 0, 1, and 2 h, and total RNA was isolated and probed sequentially with SUC2 and ACT1 probes. Quantification of Northern blots was done using a Phosphoimager; the signals were normalized to the actin signal and plotted relative to noninduced wt as unity (upper panel). The lower panel shows the invertase activity assayed as described in the text and plotted relative to noninduced wt as unity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)High Resolution Mapping of Histone H3 and H4 Acetylation at the SUC2 Gene in Wild Type Cells—The acetylation state of histones H3 and H4 at the SUC2 promoter was determined using the ChIP methodology combined with quantitative PCR as described under “Materials and Methods.” Chromatin from cross-linked yeast cells grown under repressing (0 h in low glucose) and derepressing conditions (1 and 2 h in low glucose) was sonicated and analyzed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig. 2 gives enrichments for the four promoter and one coding amplicon. The upstream amplicons are short and correspond to the positions of the four promoter nucleosomes. Because the actual resolution is limited by the size of the fragments obtained after sonication, the SUC2 coding sequences are probed with an amplicon located well downstream from the initiation site, at about the middle of the transcribed sequence, to avoid overlapping either with the SUC2 promoter or with the gene that is of unknown function but constitutively expressed, which lies immediately downstream of SUC2 (36Igual J.C. González-Bosch C. Franco L. Pérez-Ortín J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1867-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the repressed gene, the level of H4 acetylation is roughly constant along the promoter and coding region, but the acetylation of H3 steadily decreases from the region of the distal nucleosome 1 to the coding region. Within the promoter itself, a 6-fold decrease is ongoing from nucleosome 1 to nucleosome 4. Upon derepression there is a general increase in H3 and H4 acetylation in the promoter. In the coding region the acetylation of H3 remains very low, but the substantial acetylation of H4 shows a 2-fold increase after 2 h in low glucose. The enrichment of H4 acetylation is roughly similar for nucleosomes 1 to 3 and in the coding region, but upon full derepression (2 h) a more pronounced hyperacetylation (more than a 3-fold increase over basal level) is observed centered on nucleosome 4, which lies over the TATA box.High Resolution Mapping of Histone H3 Acetylation in the SUC2 Gene in the Mutant Strains—Fig. 3 shows the levels of H3 acetylation in the gcn5, snf2, gcn5/snf2 and gcn5ΔBr mutants, as well as in the wild type strain. Results, given as histograms, are relative to the amount of acetylated H3 (taken as unity) in the repressed wild type cells. This normalization is to facilitate the comparison between wt and mutant strains at each individual amplicon. In the gcn5 mutant, the basal level of histone H3 acetylation is similar to that of the wild type strain and even somewhat higher in nucleosome 1. On the other hand, under derepressing conditions, a substantial decrease in histone H3 acetylation is observed along the entire promoter. These results indicate that the rise in histone H3 acetylation observed upon SUC2 derepression in the wild type strain is dependent on Gcn5p, whereas the basal level observed in repressed cells is not. These comments do not apply to the coding region, where, after 2 h in low glucose, the level of histone H3 acetylation is similar to that in wild type cells.Fig. 3Histone H3 acetylation levels at the SUC2 gene in wt and mutant strains. X-ChIP assays were performed using the αAc-H3 antibody. DNA isolated from immunoprecipitated formaldehyde-cross-linked chromatin was subjected to PCR analysis using specific primer pairs encompassing positioned nucleosomes in the promoter and one fragment from the coding region (Fig. 2A) as well as a fragment from the actin promoter serving as a positive control for the ChIP assay. The histograms show the relative enrichments in acetylation, determined from the relationship (31Noma K. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Science. 2001; 293: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) (bound SUC2/bound actin)/(input SUC2/input actin), where “bound” and “input” refer to the corresponding DNA fractions after immunoprecipitation and “SUC2” and “actin” stand for the amplicons used in the PCR analysis. Results are plotted relative to the value found in the repressed (0 h) wt cells for each amplicon. The gel bands resulting from the PCR analyses, as well as the input and actin controls, are shown below the histograms for each amplicon.

Moreover, H3 acetylation remains roughly constant over the 2 h of induction, in sharp contrast to the gcn5 cells. The double mutant gcn5/snf2 is characterized by a low level of H3 acetylation in both the promoter and the coding region, and this does not depend on the glucose concentration in the culture medium.In the mutant strain gcn5ΔBr, there is little change in H3 acetylation ongoing from repressing to fully derepressing conditions. For nucleosome 1 the basal H3 acetylation is somewhat higher than in the gcn5 mutant and drops slightly upon transfer to low glucose.High Resolution Mapping of Histone H4 Acetylation in the SUC2 Gene in the Mutant Strains—Fig. 4 shows changes in H4 acetylation in SUC2 promoter and coding region in the wt and four mutant strains. In the gcn5 mutant the basal level of histone H4 acetylation in the promoter as well as in the coding region is almost identical to that in the wild type cells. Upon SUC2 induction, the increase in H4 acetylation is similar to that in the wild type strain over the entire locus. The increase in H4 acetylation on the TATA box nucleosome, which becomes heavily acetylated in wild type cells (see Fig. 2), takes place even faster in the gcn5 mutant (compare the wt and gcn5 data at 1 h of derepression).Fig. 4Histone H4 acetylation level at the SUC2 gene in wt and mutant strains.

It recognizes a specific site spanning the coding DNA region of antigen receptor genes and produces double-stranded DNA breaks at the board between coding and signal sequences. Two broken DNA ends are joined by a double-stranded break repair system. Both RAG (recombination activation gene) 1 and RAG2 proteins are absolutely required for this process although the catalytic residues of V(D)J recombinase are exclusively located at RAG1 according to recent mutational analyses. In this study we identified some acidic amino acid residues in RAG1 responsible for the interaction with RAG2. Mutation on these residues caused a decrease of cleavage activity in vitro and failure of RAG-RSS DNA synaptic complex formation. This result is complementary to previous reports in which positively charged amino acids in RAG2 play an important role in RAG1 binding.

This result is complementary to previous reports in which positively charged amino acids in RAG2 play an important role in RAG1 binding. The gene encoding the variable region of antigen receptors (immunoglobulins or T cell receptors) is composed of a cluster of small gene segments (V, D, and J). These segments are sequentially and specifically assembled by a lymphoid-specific gene rearrangement process, called V(D)J recombination, during lymphocyte development (1Kim D.R. Park S.J. Oettinger M.A Mol. Cell. 2000; 10: 367-374Google Scholar, 2Lewis S.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 27-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sakano H. Huppi K. Heinrich G. Tonegawa S. Nature. 1979; 280: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Each gene segment is flanked by recombination signal sequences (RSS) 1The abbreviations used are: RSS, recombination signal sequence; RAG, recombination activating gene; HMG1, high mobility group 1. that can be specifically recognized by the V(D)J recombinase. The signal sequence consists of two conserved sequences (heptamer, 5′-CACAGTG-3′, and nonamer, 5′-ACAAAAACC-3′), separated by a spacer of either 12 bp (“12-signal”) or 23 bp (“23-signal”). To begin this lymphoid-specific process, two signals (one 12-signal and one 23-signal) are specifically selected and rearranged under the “12/23 rule” (2Lewis S.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 27-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, once an array of gene segments for a specific antigen receptor is rearranged, the gene rearrangement process for other antigen receptors is prohibited within a lymphocyte (2Lewis S.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 27-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). V(D)J recombination occurs at two steps. First, two lymphoid-specific proteins, RAG1 and RAG2 (4Oettinger M.A. Schatz D.G. Gorka C. Baltimore D. Science. 1990; 248: 1517-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 5Schatz D.G. Oettinger M.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 59: 1035-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar), recognize signal sequences and form a synaptic complex with the assistance of HMG1, one of the non-histone chromatin proteins (6Hiom K. Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1011-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Then, RAG proteins cut DNA at the border between signal sequence and coding sequence. At this cleavage step, DNA is nicked first by RAG proteins at the top strand, and then the 3′-hydroxyl group attacks the phosphodiester bond of the bottom strand by a direct nucleophilic reaction, resulting in formation of a hairpin intermediate at the coding end (7McBlane J.F. van Gent D.C. Ramsden D.A. Romeo C. Cuomo C.A. Gellert M. Cell. 1995; 83: 387-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 8Van Gent D.C. McBlane J.F. Ramsden D.A. Sadofsky M.J. Hesse J.E. Gellert M. Cell. 1995; 81: 925-934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). At the second step, the broken DNA ends are repaired by double strand break repair proteins. The coding ends resolved by a specific endonuclease are usually further processed before being repaired, which allows antigen receptors to be more diverse. Deletion or addition of some nucleotides at the coding joint of antigen receptor genes is commonly observed. Terminal deoxynucleotide transferase has been known as a polymerase that plays a role in nucleotide addition during the V(D)J recombination process (9Epplen J.T. Chluba J. Hardt C. Hinkkanen A. Steimie V. Stockinger H. Hum. Genet. 1987; 75: 300-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Many other DNA double strand repair proteins have been implicated in their roles in V(D)J recombination. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) can phosphorylate other repair proteins as well as its own subunits of Ku 70 and Ku 86 (10Hammarsten O. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Recently, Arthemis protein has been known as a nuclease involved in opening hairpin intermediates produced from the V(D)J cleavage. It has dual specific nuclease activities (endonuclease or exonuclease activity). DNA-PK-dependent phosphorylation of Arthemis allows this protein to resolve the hairpin intermediates by changing its specificity from exonuclease to endonuclease (11Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Hairpin openings at the coding sequence can be achieved by another nuclease activity of RAG proteins (12Besmer E. Mansilla-Soto J. Cassard S. Sawchuk D.J. Brown G. Sadofsky M. Lewis S.M. Nussenzweig M.C. Cortes P. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 817-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). XRCC4, DNA ligase IV, and NBS1-MRE11-RAD50 complex are major double strand break repair proteins involved in V(D)J recombination (13Grawunder U. Wilm M. Wu X. Kulesza P. Wilson T.E. Mann M.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2996-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In vitro V(D)J cleavage requires only two lymphoid-specific proteins, RAG1 and RAG2 (7McBlane J.F. van Gent D.C. Ramsden D.A. Romeo C. Cuomo C.A. Gellert M. Cell. 1995; 83: 387-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 8Van Gent D.C. McBlane J.F. Ramsden D.A. Sadofsky M.J. Hesse J.E. Gellert M.

Purified RAG proteins were able to nick and form a hairpin using oligonucleotide-based substrates containing either a single signal sequence or two signal sequences (12- and 23-signal) in vitro. In addition, they formed RSS DNA-RAG complexes in vitro although their ability for complex formation was greatly enhanced by HMG1 (16Akamatsu Y. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4670-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 17Hiom K. Gellert M. Cell. 1997; 88: 65-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 18Mo X. Bailin T. Sadofsky M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7025-7031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Several different types of RAG-DNA complexes have been observed. RAG1 alone can form a complex with a single RSS DNA, although it is very unstable. RAG complex formation by RAG1 is largely increased in the presence of RAG2 (19Swanson P.C. Desiderio S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3674-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). RAG1 and RAG2 form at least two complexes with a single RSS DNA (12- or 23-signal) (20Bailin T. Mo X. Sadofsky M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4664-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 21Mundy C. Patenge N. Mattews A. Oettinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the presence of the second RSS DNA and HMG1, RAG proteins form a paired complex (6Hiom K. Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1011-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 21Mundy C. Patenge N. Mattews A. Oettinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although the exact composition of these complexes is unclear, the paired complex is composed of two signal sequences (12- and 23-signal), HMG1, and at least two RAG proteins each (20Bailin T. Mo X. Sadofsky M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4664-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 21Mundy C. Patenge N. Mattews A. Oettinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Once RAG-DNA complexes are formed, they are very stable. This stable RAG-DNA complex can last even after DNA is cut by RAG proteins. In fact, the post-synaptic complex of RAG proteins and RSS DNA has been isolated after cleavage (22Agrawal A. Schatz D.G. Cell. 1997; 89: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Thus, direct interaction between two RAG proteins is essential for synaptic complex or post-synaptic complex formation. Many mutation analyses of RAG1 or RAG2 have been performed to identify crucial amino acid residues or regions that might be involved in catalysis or interaction with other proteins during the V(D)J recombination process. Most polymerases, transposases, and recombinases contain two or three acidic residues at the active site. These residues chelate divalent ions that can form a transient complex necessary for catalysis. Recently, three acidic residues (called the “DD..E” motif) of V(D)J recombinase have been identified using random mutation analysis. Exclusively located at RAG1, they are Asp600, Asp708, and Glu962 (23Fugmann S.D. Villey I.J. Ptaszek L.M. Schatz D.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 24Kim D.R. Dai Y. Mundy C.L. Yang W.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3059-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Mutation at these residues abolished the catalytic activity in vivo or in vitro although the RSS DNA binding activity remained normal. In addition, many short deleted regions of RAG genes had influence on V(D)J recombination activity in V(D)J recombination analyses in vivo (26Aidinis V. Dias D. Gomez C. Bhattacharyya D. Spanopoulou E. Santagata S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5826-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27McMahan C. Sadofsky M. Schatz D. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2202-2210PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sadofsky M.J. Hesse J.E. McBlane J. Gellert M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5644-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 29Sadofsky M.J. Hesse J.E. Gellert M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1805-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In other studies, some mutant RAG genes were directly isolated from human immunodeficiency patients with Omenn syndrome or severe combined immunodeficiency disease (30Villa A. Santagata S. Bozzi F. Giliani S. Frattini A. Imberti L. Gatta L.B. Ochs H.D. Schwarz K. Notarangelo L.D. Vezzoni P. Spanopoulou E. Cell. 1998; 93: 885-896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). They were defective in catalysis or DNA-RAG complex formation. The RAG1 domains or amino acid residues responsible for the interaction with RAG2 were not clearly defined although few putative regions for the RAG2 interaction have been suggested. The core domains of RAG1 (384–1004) and RAG2 (1–383) have been previously identified, and these minimal regions of RAG proteins were fully catalytically active in vitro or in vivo (28Sadofsky M.J. Hesse J.E. McBlane J. Gellert M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5644-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 29Sadofsky M.J. Hesse J.E. Gellert M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1805-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, the domain responsible for RAG2 interaction must be located within regions (amino acids 384–1004) of RAG1. According to the deletional analysis of RAG1, zinc finger B (amino acids 727–750) of RAG1 was required for interaction with RAG2 in a pulldown analysis (26Aidinis V. Dias D. Gomez C. Bhattacharyya D. Spanopoulou E. Santagata S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5826-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27McMahan C. Sadofsky M. Schatz D. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2202-2210PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the 558KRFRY562 (555KRFRY559 in mouse) region of human RAG1 has been suggested to have a role in the interaction with RAG2. In particular, R561H or R561C RAG1 mutants found in Omenn syndrome patients showed defects in the interaction with RAG2 in vitro (30Villa A. Santagata S. Bozzi F. Giliani S. Frattini A. Imberti L. Gatta L.B. Ochs H.D. Schwarz K. Notarangelo L.D. Vezzoni P. Spanopoulou E. Cell. 1998; 93: 885-896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Recently, positively charged amino acids (e.g. Arg73, Arg137) in RAG2 have been implicated as having roles in binding to RAG1, suggesting that negatively charged amino acid residues in RAG1 might be involved in RAG complex formation through some ionic interactions at the interface between two proteins (31Fumann S. Schatz D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 889-910Google Scholar). In this work, we found that mutations at some acidic residues in RAG1 revealed severe catalytic defects because of the failure of complex formation with RAG2. Proteins—Wild-type RAG1 and RAG2 proteins were purified by the methods previously described (24Kim D.R. Dai Y. Mundy C.L. Yang W. Oettinger M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3070-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 32Kim D.R. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4679-4688Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Mutant RAG1 was generated by site-specific mutagenesis using a plasmid, pDRK534, containing a RAG1 coding region (amino acids 352–1040); all mutant proteins were prepared by the same method (24Kim D.R. Dai Y. Mundy C.L. Yang W. Oettinger M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3070-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). For the HMG1 preparation, BL21 (DE3)LysS cells containing plasmid pDVG83 (obtained from Dr. D. C. van Gent, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands) were grown in 500 ml of culture medium and lysed by sonication in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme. After centrifugation (25,000 rpm, 30 min), the supernatant was subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation (2–10%). The final pellet was washed with 10 ml of cold acetone and dried after centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 30 min). MHG1 proteins were dialyzed against a buffer of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol and stored at –80 °C. V(D)J Cleavage and Binding Analyses—Cleavage reactions were performed as previously described (24Kim D.R. Dai Y. Mundy C.L. Yang W. Oettinger M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3070-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 32Kim D.R. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4679-4688Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In brief, the reaction mix, containing 0.25 pmol 32P-labeled oligonucleotide substrates, about 100 ng of RAG1, and 50 ng of RAG2 with or without HMG1 (50 ng) in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 60 mm KGlu, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm Mn2+, was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. Reaction products were separated in a 10% 7 m urea super-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and identified by autoradiography. Binding assay was carried out under the same condition as the cleavage reaction except 0.025 pmol substrate was used with 50-fold nonspecific competitor DNA. The binding reaction mix was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and separated by a 4–20% or 8% native polyacrylamide gel. Binding products were visualized by autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation—Purified FLAG-tagged RAG2 and RAG1 (wild-type or mutants) was mixed (1 μg each) and incubated in a buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 4 °C for 1 h. Anti-FLAG antibody crossed-linked agarose beads (30 μl) (Sigma) were added to the reaction mix and incubated for 2 h. The agarose beads were washed with binding buffer three times. Bound proteins were separated in a 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and RAG1 was detected by a general method of Western blot using anti-RAG1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Mutations at Three RAG1 Acidic Residues Cause Defect on the RAG2 Binding—Two essential proteins in V(D)J recombination, RAG1 and RAG2, have been known to form a multimeric complex before the initiation of DNA binding and cleavage reactions. The RAG protein complex specifically selects two signal sequences flanking the coding region to be rearranged and forms a stable synaptic complex with DNA (6Hiom K. Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1011-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 15Eastman Q.M. Leu T.M. Schatz D.G. Nature. 1996; 380: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Thus, the direct interaction between RAG1 and RAG2 is crucial in forming an initiation complex for the V(D)J recombination process. Previously, we created random mutant RAG1 proteins and identified some key residues directly involved in the catalytic reaction of V(D)J cleavage (24Kim D.R. Dai Y. Mundy C.L. Yang W. Oettinger M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3070-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Mutations at these residues of RAG1 completely abolished the catalytic activity of V(D)J recombinase. In addition, some other RAG1 mutant proteins revealed a severe decrease in their cleavage activities. Both nick and hairpin formation of two mutant RAG1 proteins at the aspartate residues (D546A and D560A) were decreased about 15-fold more than those of wild-type RAG1 in oligonucleotide-based cleavage analysis in vitro. E547A RAG1 (mutation of glutamate to alanine at 547) also showed some defectiveness in both nick and hairpin formation in vitro (Fig. 1A, lanes 4, 5, 7). Other RAG1 proteins mutated at adjacent acidic residues did not have influence on the V(D)J cleavage activity of RAG1 (Fig. 1). We further tested whether these decreased activities of mutant RAG1 proteins were because of intrinsically defective catalysis or failure in forming a complex between signal sequence DNA and RAG proteins. All three mutant RAG1 proteins formed a normal DNA-RAG1 complex (Fig. 2, R1), but they failed in the formation of DNA-RAG1-RAG2 complex (R1/R2), suggesting that these RAG1 mutant proteins have defects in the interaction with RAG2 although they can normally recognize and bind to the signal sequences (Fig. 2). In addition, these mutant proteins failed to form the paired complex (Fig. 2, PC) with the second RSS DNA molecule. Other RAG1 mutant proteins behaved like a wild-type RAG1 in RAG-DNA complex formation as shown in Fig. 2.Fig. 2In vitro binding activity of RAG1 mutant proteins. The gel shift analysis of RAG1 proteins was performed as previously described (24Kim D.R. Dai Y. Mundy C.L. Yang W. Oettinger M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3070-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A 12-signal substrate was labeled by 32P. RAG-DNA complexes were separated by a 4–20% gradient native polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. Wild-type RAG2 (R2) and different RAG1 (R1) proteins (wild-type (WT) and mutants) were used for these analyses. 23S represents unlabeled 23-signal substrates. It was added to only some reactions (lanes 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, and 22) at the same mole ratio as labeled 12-signal substrates. R1, R1/R2, and PC indicate RAG1-DNA complex, RAG1/RAG2-DNA complexes, and paired complex, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A D546A RAG1 Mutant Protein Abolished the Hairpin Formation Activity Recovered by a Catalytic Mutant RAG1 Protein (D708C)—Mutation to alanine at Asp708 of RAG1 (D708A), one of the catalytic residues, completely removed the catalytic activity of RAG1, but the transition of this aspartate residue to cysteine (D708C) recovered its catalytic activity somehow (24Kim D.R. Dai Y. Mundy C.L. Yang W. Oettinger M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3070-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We tested here how D546A RAG1 influenced the hairpin formation activity of D708C using pre-nicked oligonucleotide substrates. The D708C mutant RAG1 protein showed 10-fold more decrease in hairpin formation activity than wild-type RAG1 (Fig. 3, lanes 2–5). The hairpin formation activity of D546A was very similar to that of D708C at the same pre-nick substrate (Fig. 3, lanes 6–9), but a double mutation at D546A and D708C completely abolished this hairpin formation activity of RAG1 (Fig. 3, lanes 10–13). Two other double mutant proteins (D560A/D708C and E547A/D708C) showed a similar result as the D546A/D708C mutant RAG1 protein (data not shown), suggesting that these acidic residues are crucial for the V(D)J recombination process although they might not directly participate in the catalytic reaction. Mutant RAG1 Proteins Failed in the RAG2 Interaction by Co-immunoprecipitation in Vitro—To confirm further that these RAG1 acidic residues are involved in the interaction with RAG2, we employed co-immunoprecipitation using purified proteins. Two purified RAG1 (wild-type or mutants) and FLAG-tagged RAG2 were incubated, and then these RAG complexes were pulled down using anti-FLAG agarose beads. The bound RAG1 protein was detected by Western blot using anti-RAG1 antibody (Fig. 4A). D546A, E547A, and D560A RAG1 proteins were defective in the interaction with RAG2 at this co-immunoprecipitation analysis, although some bound E547A and D560A proteins have been observed (Fig. 4B, lanes 5, 6, and 8). Other RAG1 mutant proteins revealed a normal interaction with RAG2 in this assay (Fig. 4B). This co-immunoprecipitation result suggests that the single point mutations at these acidic residues affect the binding ability of RAG1 to form the RAG complex that is required for the V(D)J recombination process. V(D)J Recombination Activities of Mutant RAG1 Proteins at the KRFRY Region—Previously, the 555KRFRY559 region of mouse RAG1 has been suggested to be directly involved in binding with RAG2 during the V(D)J recombination process (30Villa A. Santagata S. Bozzi F. Giliani S. Frattini A. Imberti L. Gatta L.B. Ochs H.D. Schwarz K. Notarangelo L.D. Vezzoni P. Spanopoulou E. Cell. 1998; 93: 885-896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). All five individual amino acid residues of this region were mutated, and their roles in the interaction with RAG2 were determined. Mutations at three positive residues K555G, R556G, and R558G did not affect V(D)J cleavage activity. All three mutant RAG1 proteins showed very similar activity as wild-type RAG1 in both nick and hairpin formation (Fig. 5A), suggesting that these basic amino acid residues are not involved in the interaction with RAG2. In addition, mutations at two aromatic residues Phe557 (F557G) and Tyr559 (Y559G) to glycine eradicated the binding and cleavage activity of RAG1 (Fig. 5B, lanes 3 and 4; Fig. 5C, lanes 4, 5, 8, 9). These F557G and Y559G mutant RAG1 proteins were very poorly expressed in bacterial cells before being subjected to protein purification in comparison with wild-type RAG1 (data not shown), so the non-detectable activity of these mutant proteins might be the result of the structural change of RAG1. In fact, changing these residues to other similar kinds of aromatic amino acids (F557Y and Y559F) did not affect binding and cleavage activities of RAG1 (Fig. 5B, lanes 5 and 6; Fig. 5C, lanes 6, 7, 10, 11). However, transition of these aromatic residues to another hydrophobic residue (leucine) still made proteins inactive in vitro (data not shown). The other possible role of these aromatic amino acid residues in the RAG2 interaction will be discussed later. Two RAG proteins, RAG1 and RAG2, are essential to initiate the V(D)J recombination process that provides the diversity of immunoglobulin or T cell receptor repertoires during the lymphoid cell development. These two RAG proteins are expressed separately and form complexes in cells. RAG proteins form a synaptic complex with two signals (12- and 23-signals) and proceed with the V(D)J cleavage reaction. Once the RAG complex binds to RSS DNA, the RAG-DNA complex is very stable (16Akamatsu Y. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4670-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Several RAG-DNA complexes have been observed by gel mobility shift analysis in vitro (6Hiom K. Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1011-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 20Bailin T. Mo X. Sadofsky M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4664-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 21Mundy C. Patenge N. Mattews A. Oettinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). RAG1 alone can weakly bind to RSS DNA as shown in Fig. 1. RAG1 and RAG2 proteins form a couple of complexes (synaptic complex 1 or 2) with RSS DNA containing either a single 12-signal or 23-signal sequence (21Mundy C. Patenge N. Mattews A. Oettinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these proteins tend to form the paired complex in the presence of both 12- and 23-signal sequences and HMG1 (17Hiom K. Gellert M. Cell. 1997; 88: 65-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). RAG2 alone does not seem to bind to RSS DNA. However, RAG2 greatly enhanced RAG1 binding to the DNA molecule and the binding specificity of RAG proteins (16Akamatsu Y. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4670-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 19Swanson P.C. Desiderio S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3674-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). DNA footprinting analysis showed that DNA-contacting regions of RAG1 only and RAG1/RAG2 complex were very similar to each other (16Akamatsu Y. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4670-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to form these stable RAG-DNA complexes, the direct interaction between RAG1 and RAG2 is absolutely required. In fact, this interaction has been previously observed using immunoprecipitation or affinity pulldown analyses (26Aidinis V. Dias D. Gomez C. Bhattacharyya D. Spanopoulou E. Santagata S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5826-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27McMahan C. Sadofsky M. Schatz D. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2202-2210PubMed Google Scholar). Among several RAG mutants defective in the formation of RAG-DNA complex, a RAG1 mutant at Arg561 (R561H) that was screened from human Omenn syndrome patients caused a decrease of the in vitro DNA binding ability of RAG proteins due to the failure of RAG1-RAG2 interaction (30Villa A. Santagata S. Bozzi F. Giliani S. Frattini A. Imberti L. Gatta L.B. Ochs H.D. Schwarz K. Notarangelo L.D. Vezzoni P. Spanopoulou E. Cell. 1998; 93: 885-896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). However, the mutant protein at this arginine residue was able to carry on the normal V(D)J cleavage activity in our current study (Fig. 5A). Mutation at Arg558 (the same amino acid as Arg561 in human RAG1) to glycine (R558G) did not seem to affect nick or hairpin formation in vitro. In addition, other near positively charged amino acid residues (Lys555 and Arg556) within the 555KRFRY559 region did not play a key role in the V(D)J cleavage. In conclusion, all three basic amino acid residues at this region do not participate in RSS DNA binding and V(D)J cleavage in our assay conditions. However, removal of the other two aromatic residues (Phe557 and Tyr559) at this region eliminated the V(D)J recombination activity, and replacement of other kinds of aromatic residues (phenylalanine to tyrosine or tyrosine to phenylalanine) recovered the normal activity of RAG1 in DNA binding and cleavage. Therefore, removal of these aromatic residues might cause alteration of the overall protein structure and lead to the defective activity of RAG1 in V(D)J recombination. In fact, these two RAG1 mutant proteins (F557G and Y559G) were little expressed in bacterial cells in comparison with wild-type RAG1 before protein purification, and the expression of the other two mutant proteins (F557Y and Y559F) in bacterial cells was compatible to that of the wild-type protein. On the other hand, the hydrophobic phenyl rings of these aromatic amino acids might participate in interchelation with other hydrophobic pockets in RAG2 at the interface between RAG1 and RAG2. There is a previous study to support this possibility: the Trp317 RAG2 mutant protein failed in the interaction with RAG1 (26Aidinis V. Dias D. Gomez C. Bhattacharyya D. Spanopoulou E. Santagata S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5826-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), implicating that this RAG2 residue can be involved in the hydrophobic interaction with some other RAG1 residues during the V(D)J recombination process. RAG2 mutant proteins at basic residues such as R73A or R137A showed a severe defect in RAG1-RAG2 interaction, leading to complete disruption in RAG-DNA complex formation (31Fumann S. Schatz D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 889-910Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these basic residues might locate at the interface and form ionic interactions with the negatively charged residues of RAG1. In this study, we found that three acidic residues (Asp546, Glu547, and Asp560) of RAG1 were responsible for the interaction with RAG2 in the V(D)J recombination analysis (Fig. 2). These three acidic residues are highly conserved among several RAG1 proteins that were cloned from different species (25Landree M.A. Wibbenmeyer J.A. Roth D.B. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3059-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A single mutation at these amino acid residues of RAG1 caused a great decrease of RAG-RSS DNA complex formation with RAG2 although mutant RAG1 protein alone can still form a normal RAG1-RSS DNA complex, suggesting that these residues are directly involved in the interaction with RAG2. In addition, immunoprecipitation analysis using purified proteins has shown that mutant RAG1 proteins at these three acidic residues were defective in direct binding to RAG2 (Fig. 4B). In addition, mutation at one of these amino acid residues completely removed the recovered hairpin formation activity by a mutant RAG1 at the catalytic residue (D708C) (Fig. 2), implicating this residue as important for RAG1 to achieve full catalysis although it might not be directly involved in the catalytic reaction. Many other RAG2 basic residues (Lys119, His140, Arg159, Arg229, Lys283) have also been implicated as having roles in the formation of RAG-DNA complex although it was not clear whether they were directly involved in RAG1 interaction (31Fumann S. Schatz D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 889-910Google Scholar, 33Qui J. Kale S.B. Schultz H.Y. Roth D.B. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 77-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Altogether, by forming a stable complex through ionic linkages with RAG2 some acidic residues in RAG1 are very crucial for V(D)J recombination activity, although further structural analyses using x-ray crystallography are necessary to make a solid conclusion about the interface between two RAG proteins."

Simulations of structure formation in the universe are not entirely consistent with the properties of halos inferred from observation. In his Perspective, [Freeman][1] discusses recent results about matter obtained by measuring the gravitational lensing of distant objects by intervening galaxies. Lensing surveys indicate that halos contribute about 11% of the mass of the universe, compared with about 0.4% in stars and cold gas. Intergalactic matter and gas probably make up another 16%, and the remaining 73% is in the form of a poorly understood dark energy.
