https://openalex.org/W2109509368,"Adult chimpanzees, given access to an array of pieces of banana, select the pieces in order of size, larger pieces being taken first. Selection is mediated by perceived sizes, and the responses correspond closely to human visual judgment of size."

https://openalex.org/W2025055284,"Near-ultraviolet sunlight is absorbed by sulfur dioxide to produce electronically excited molecules, which react with n-butane in the presence of wet or dry air to produce an aerosol and eventually a liquid precipitate. The product is a heavily oxidized, sulfur-containing, organic strong acid. The possible role of these reactions in photochemical air pollution is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1976367399,"An intermediate size class of the insect component of a natural community contained more individuals than did a small size class, altering the expected ecological pyramid of numbers. The anomaly resulted from the presence of an abundant immigrant species, and it is suggested that departures from the normal pyramid might, in general, imply external disturbance."

https://openalex.org/W2008027383,"(1) It is shown that hypothalamic stimulation in cats, with faradic currents eliciting the syndrome of sham rage, produces after the elimination of the sympathetico-adrenal system a hypoglycemia when the vagi are intact. After bilateral vagotomy the stimulation results in a slight and delayed rise in blood sugar. (2) If in cats in which, due to a sectioning of the spinal cord at the sixth cervical segment, the effect of central discharges on the sympathetico-adrenal system is eliminated, a rage response is elicited by a barking dog it produces a fall in blood sugar. The sectioning of the vagi below the diaphragm abolishes this reaction. From these experiments it is concluded that the normal emotional process as well as the sham rage reaction is characterized by a simultaneous discharge over the vago-insulin and sympathetico-adrenal system. The latter predominates in the normal animal and masks the effects on the former."

https://openalex.org/W2068888058,"The distribution of elevations representing a region can be shown as a cumulative frequency curve plotted on probability paper. Many elevation distributions are ""zig-zag"" curves which can be represented conveniently by measures of skewness and kurtosis. A plot of skewness versus kurtosis permits the recognition of six major, non-Gaussian forms, with countless gradations."
https://openalex.org/W1983021297,"THE nuclear reaction produced by neutron bombardment in heavy elements can be conveniently described, according to Bohr, with the assumption that, as soon as the bombarding neutron strikes the nucleus, it is incorporated into the nuclear structure with the formation of the so-called compound nucleus. This is a relatively stable system in the sense that its lifetime is very long compared with the frequencies of nuclear particles; in an absolute sense, however, the life-time is very short, being sometimes of the order of 10-12 sec. and sometimes much less."
