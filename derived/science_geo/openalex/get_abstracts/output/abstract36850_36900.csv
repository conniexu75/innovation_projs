https://openalex.org/W2028585334,"Exposure of Escherichia coli to low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide results in DNA damage that causes mutagenesis and kills the bacteria, whereas higher concentrations of peroxide reduce the amount of such damage. Earlier studies indicated that the direct DNA oxidant is a derivative of hydrogen peroxide whose formation is dependent on cell metabolism. The generation of this oxidant depends on the availability of both reducing equivalents and an iron species, which together mediate a Fenton reaction in which ferrous iron reduces hydrogen peroxide to a reactive radical. An in vitro Fenton system was established that generates DNA strand breaks and inactivates bacteriophage and that also reproduces the suppression of DNA damage by high concentrations of peroxide. The direct DNA oxidant both in vivo and in this in vitro system exhibits reactivity unlike that of a free hydroxyl radical and may instead be a ferryl radical."
https://openalex.org/W1583304743,"H-ras-transformed human bronchial epithelial cells (TBE-1) secrete a single major extracellular matrix metalloprotease which is not found in the normal parental cells. The enzyme is secreted in a latent form of 72 kDa, which can be activated to catalyze the cleavage of the basement membrane macromolecule type IV collagen. The substrates in their order of preference are: gelatin, type IV collagen, type V collagen, fibronectin, and type VII collagen; but the enzyme does not cleave the interstitial collagens or laminin. This protease is identical to gelatinase isolated from normal human skin explants, normal human skin fibroblasts, and SV40-transformed human lung fibroblasts. Based on its ability to initiate the degradation of type IV collagen in a pepsin-resistant portion of the molecule, it will be referred to as type IV collagenase. This enzyme is most likely the human analog of type IV collagenase detected in several rodent tumors, which has the same molecular mass and has been linked to their metastatic potential. Type IV collagenase consists of three domains. Two of them, the amino-terminal domain and the carboxyl-terminal domain, are homologous to interstitial collagenase and human and rat stromelysin. The middle domain, of 175 residues, is organized into three 58-residue head-to-tail repeats which are homologous to the type II motif of the collagen-binding domain of fibronectin. Type IV collagenase represents the third member of a newly recognized gene family coding for secreted extracellular matrix metalloproteases, which includes interstitial fibroblast collagenase and stromelysin."
https://openalex.org/W1974325040,"We show that transcription of a DNA molecule inside a bacterium is accompanied by local and temporal supercoiling of the DNA template: as transcription proceeds, DNA in front of the transcription ensemble becomes positively supercoiled, and DNA behind the ensemble becomes negatively supercoiled. Because bacterial gyrase and topoisomerase I act differently on positively and negatively supercoiled DNA, the formation of twin supercoiled domains during transcription is manifested by a large increase or decrease in the linking number of an intracellular plasmid when bacterial DNA gyrase or topoisomerase I, respectively, is inhibited. Such changes in linking number are strongly dependent on transcription of the plasmid in cis and on the relative orientations of transcription units on the plasmid. These results indicate that the state of supercoiling of bacterial DNA is strongly modulated by transcription, and that DNA topoisomerases are normally involved in the elongation step of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1650137855,"In rat brain three members of the protein kinase C family encoded by cDNAs termed delta, epsilon, and zeta were newly identified by molecular cloning and sequence analysis. The new members have a common structure that is closely related to but clearly distinct from the four members of the family previously isolated having alpha-, beta I-, beta II-, and gamma-sequences, although the zeta-cDNA available at present does not appear to contain a complete reading frame for protein kinase C. The delta-, epsilon-, and zeta-cDNAs all encode a characteristic cysteine-rich sequence and protein kinase domain sequence, both of which are highly homologous among the protein kinase C family. However, the new members lack one of the conserved regions that is present in alpha-, beta I-, beta II-, and gamma-sequences. An additional cDNA clone termed epsilon' was isolated, which is identical with epsilon-cDNA except for a short sequence at the 5'-terminal end region. The two members having delta- and epsilon-sequences were expressed in COS 7 cells, and partially purified and characterized. The enzymes having delta- and epsilon-sequences depend on phospholipid and diacylglycerol for the enzymatic activity, but their properties slightly differ from the previously known members of protein kinase C. Northern blot analysis suggests that the new members of protein kinase C exist in the brain and some other tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1497274503,"This report describes the purification of the major protein-tyrosine-phosphatases from human placenta. Enzyme activity was followed with a novel artificial substrate, namely reduced, carboxamidomethylated, and maleylated lysozyme, phosphorylated on tyrosine by a partially purified preparation of insulin and epidermal growth factor receptor kinases, also from human placenta. The key step in the purification of the protein-tyrosine-phosphatases was affinity chromatography on a column of thiophosphorylated, reduced, carboxamidomethylated, and maleylated lysozyme-Sepharose. Purification was carried out separately from both the and fractions. Whereas multiple and distinct enzyme forms were obtained from each of these, little difference could be detected between the behavior of the soluble enzyme subtypes and their particulate counterparts. The major subtypes were purified to apparent homogeneity with an approximately 23,000-fold enrichment and 10% yield from the fraction and a 4,300-fold enrichment and 13% yield from the fraction. Both samples migrated as bands of 35 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and had specific activities of approximately 45,000 nmol of Pi released min-1 mg-1, at least 2-3-fold higher than that of the type 1 and 2A serine/threonine phosphatases. The level of protein-tyrosine-phosphatases in the fraction of human placenta (2,000 units/g of protein) was approximately the same as protein-serine/threonine-phosphatases 1 and 2A in skeletal muscle."

https://openalex.org/W1499420960,"In the preceding article (Tonks, N. K., Diltz, C. D., and Fischer, E. H. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6722-6730), the purification of the major protein-tyrosine-phosphatases from human placenta, some to apparent homogeneity, was described. This report compares the characteristics of these enzymes and clearly identifies at least two distinct protein-tyrosine-phosphatase catalytic subunits. All were absolutely specific for phosphotyrosyl residues and showed no activity on any of the phosphoseryl/phosphothreonyl-containing proteins tested; they exhibited a high affinity for substrate with Km values in the submicromolar range. All were absolutely dependent on sulfhydryl compounds and appeared to contain at least one highly reactive cysteinyl residue essential for activity. Subtypes 1A and 1B could be distinguished by their response to polyanionic and polycationic compounds. The 1B enzymes were activated by EDTA, spermine, spermidine, and myelin basic protein to a greater extent than the 1A subtypes. Furthermore, they were inhibited by approximately 2 orders of magnitude lower concentrations of heparin (IC50 approximately 20 nM) and 1:1 or 4:1 poly (glutamate/tyrosine) (IC50 approximately 50 nM) than the 1A subtypes. Surprisingly, inhibition by the glutamate/tyrosine copolymers was strictly noncompetitive. Peptide mapping following digestion with Achromobacter protease I or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease supported the view that, whereas protein-tyrosine-phosphatase subtypes 1A and 1B are different, their soluble and particulate counterparts are closely related structurally and are distinct from serine/threonine phosphatases 1 and 2A."

https://openalex.org/W1593576309,"To evaluate the substrate specificity of methyl-directed mismatch repair in Escherichia coli extracts, we have constructed a set of DNA heteroduplexes, each of which contains one of the eight possible single base pair mismatches and a single hemimethylated d(GATC) site. Although all eight mismatches were located at the same position within heteroduplex molecules and were embedded within the same sequence environment, they were not corrected with equal efficiencies in vitro. G-T was corrected most efficiently, with A-C, C-T, A-A, T-T, and G-G being repaired at rates 40-80% of that of the G-T mispair. Correction of each of these six mispairs occurred in a methyl-directed manner in a reaction requiring mutH, mutL, and mutS gene products. C-C and A-G mismatches showed different behavior. C-C was an extremely poor substrate for correction while repair of A-G was anomalous. Although A-G was corrected to A-T by the mutHLS-dependent, methyl-directed pathway, repair of A-G to C-G occurred largely by a pathway that is independent of the methylation state of the heteroduplex and which does not require mutH, mutL, or mutS gene products. Similar results were obtained with a second A-G mismatch in a different sequence environment suggesting that a novel pathway may exist for processing A-G mispairs to C-G base pairs. As judged by DNase I footprint analysis, MutS protein is capable of recognizing each of the eight possible base-base mismatches. Use of this method to estimate the apparent affinity of MutS protein for each of the mispairs revealed a rough correlation between MutS affinity and efficiency of correction by the methyl-directed pathway. However, the A-C mismatch was an exception in this respect indicating that interactions other than mismatch recognition may contribute to the efficiency of repair."

https://openalex.org/W1979059085,"Insulin receptor complementary DNA has been cloned from an insulin-resistant patient with leprechaunism whose receptors exhibited multiple abnormalities in insulin binding. The patient is a compound heterozygote, having inherited two different mutant alleles of the insulin receptor gene. One allele contains a missense mutation encoding the substitution of glutamic acid for lysine at position 460 in the alpha subunit of the receptor. The second allele has a nonsense mutation causing premature chain termination after amino acid 671 in the alpha subunit, thereby deleting both the transmembrane and tyrosine kinase domains of the receptor. Interestingly, the father is heterozygous for this nonsense mutation and exhibits a moderate degree of insulin resistance. This raises the possibility that mutations in the insulin receptor gene may account for the insulin resistance in some patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus."

https://openalex.org/W2017699383,"Genes encoding the regulatory (BCY1) and catalytic (TPK1, TPK2, and TPK3) subunits of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) are found in S. cerevisiae. bcy1− yeast strains do not respond properly to nutrient conditions. Unlike wild type, bcy1− strains do not accumulate glycogen, form spores, or become resistant to heat shock when nutrient limited. We have isolated mutant TPK genes that suppress all of the bcy1− defects. The mutant TPK genes appear to encode functionally attenuated catalytic subunits of the cAPK. bcy1− yeast strains containing the mutant TPK genes respond appropriately to nutrient conditions, even in the absence of CDC25, both RAS genes, or CYR1. Together, these genes encode the known components of the cAMP-generating machinery. The results indicate that cAMP-independent mechanisms must exist for regulating glycogen accumulation, sporulation, and the acquisition of thermotolerance in S. cerevisiae."
https://openalex.org/W190347642,"Initiation of the coagulation protease cascade as it assembles on cell surfaces requires limited proteolytic activation of the zymogen factor X. Not previously suspected to be the ligand of an organizing receptor on cell surfaces, we now describe that factor X specifically associates with cells of monocyte lineage and we identify the high affinity receptor for this zymogen. Following stimulation with ADP (10 microM), or with the ionophore ionomycin (1 microM), isolated human monocytes bind 125I-factor X in a saturable fashion with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 21.8-44.9 nM. Equilibrium binding analyses indicate that the reaction is optimal at room temperature, requires Ca2+ ions, and saturates at 128,500 +/- 21,300 molecules of 125I-factor X specifically associated with the cell surface. Molar excess of unlabeled factor X inhibits and reverses the binding, whereas the homologous gamma-carboxylated coagulation proteins factors II, VII, IX, IXa, and Xa are without effect. Similarly, chelation of divalent ions immediately dissociates bound 125I-factor X. The monoblast cell line U 937 and the monocytic cell line THP-1 when stimulated with ADP or ionomycin, bind 125I-factor X with characteristics similar to monocytes. Receptor identity was explored using antibodies to the leukocyte adhesive receptors Mac-1, LFA-1, and p150.95. Monoclonal antibodies specific for the alpha subunit of Mac-1 (M 1/70, LM 2/1) or for the common beta subunit (TS 1/18, 60.3) bound equally to resting and ADP- or ionomycin-stimulated cells and also completely blocked the binding of 125I-factor X to stimulated monocytes, U 937, or THP-1 cells. To distinguish between modulatory effects of the monoclonal antibodies and direct spatial hindrance binding of 125I-factor X to Mac-1 was analyzed directly. OKM10 anti-alpha subunit of Mac-1 monoclonal antibody immunoprecipitated 125I-factor X chemically cross-linked to its receptor on stimulated cells. In addition, the complement protein fragment C3bi, which is a recognized ligand for Mac-1, competitively inhibited the association of 125I-factor X. These findings indicate that human blood monocytes and less differentiated cells of this lineage possess an inducible receptor specific for factor X; and also support the conclusion that the heterodimeric leukocyte adhesive receptor Mac-1 functions as the specific receptor structure. We suggest that the novel properties of this receptor may be of importance in the organization and regulation of certain coagulation protease cascades on the monocyte surface."
https://openalex.org/W1546431662,"Regulatory domains of the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II were investigated utilizing synthetic peptides. These peptides were derived from the sequence between positions 281 and 319 as translated from the cDNA sequence of the rat brain 50-kDa subunit (Lin, C. R., Kapiloff, M. S., Durgerian, S., Tatemoto, K., Russo, A. F., Hanson, P., Schulman, H., and Rosenfeld, M. G. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 84, 5962-5966), which contain the putative calmodulin-binding region as well as potential autophosphorylation sites. Peptide 290 to 309 was found to be a potent calmodulin antagonist with an IC50 of 52 nM for inhibition of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Neither truncation from the amino terminus (peptide 296-309) nor extension in the carboxyl-terminal direction (peptide 294-319) markedly affected calmodulin binding, whereas shortening the peptide from the carboxyl terminus (peptide 290-302) or from both ends (peptide 295-304) resulted in the elimination of this activity. Peptide 281-290 did not bind calmodulin, but was a good substrate for the enzyme, being phosphorylated at Thr-286. Several of the peptides inhibited the kinase in a partially competitive, substrate-directed manner, but were not themselves phosphorylated. These studies identify domains within Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II which may be involved in 1) inhibition of the kinase in the absence of calmodulin, 2) binding of calmodulin, and 3) the resulting activation. Additionally, it is suggested that phosphorylation of residues flanking these domains may be responsible for the known regulatory effects of autophosphorylation on the properties of the kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1537545744,"ATP binding to dnaA protein is essential for its action in initiating the replication of plasmids that bear the unique origin of the Escherichia coli chromosome (oriC). ADP bound to that site renders dnaA protein inactive for replication. Diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin), a diacidic membrane phospholipid, displaces the bound nucleotide, and in the presence of components that reconstitute replication, fully reactivates the inert ADP form of dnaA protein. The monacidic phosphatidylglycerol is one-tenth as active as cardiolipin, whereas the neutral phosphatidylethanolamine, the principal E. coli phospholipid, is inactive. Fluphenazine, a tranquilizer drug, blocks cardiolipin activation of dnaA protein, in keeping with the inhibitory action of such agents on phospholipid-dependent enzymes. With the use of this drug to terminate cardiolipin action, dependence of the activation on time, elevated temperature, and high levels of ATP was demonstrated. Cardiolipin binding of nucleotide-free dnaA protein prevents binding of ATP and initiation of oriC replication. Removal of a fatty acid from cardiolipin by phospholipase A reverses this inhibitory effect. The strong and specific interaction of cardiolipin, a cell membrane component, with an essential nucleotide-binding site of dnaA protein, the protein essential for the initiation of chromosome replication, may be an important element in regulating the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1998280478,"The hormone regulatory element (HRE) of mouse mammary tumor virus can mediate activation of an adjacent promoter by glucocorticoids and progestins. A detailed comparison of the DNA binding of receptors for both hormones using DNAase I footprinting and methylation protection detects clear differences in their interactions with the HRE region between positions −130 and −100. Binding studies and gene transfer experiments with a variety of mutants covering the entire HRE demonstrate differences in the relevance of the individual sequence motifs for induction by each hormone. The influence of changes in the angular orientation of receptor binding sites is also different for glucocorticoid and progesterone induction. In transfection experiments with mutated HREs, we find a functional cooperation between the receptor binding sites that does not correlate with variations in the in vitro affinity of the receptors for the corresponding DNA fragment."
https://openalex.org/W1567466567,"Previous studies have demonstrated that alpha-adrenergic stimulation of cultured, neonatal rat myocardial cells results in an increase in intracellular volume and protein content of cultured neonatal rat myocardial cells. Utilizing this model of cardiac hypertrophy, we have examined the effects of alpha-adrenergic stimulation on the accumulation of sarcomeres and the expression of a rat cardiac myofibrillar gene, myosin light chain-2 (MLC-2). Following alpha-adrenergic stimulation, cultured myocardial cells displayed a severalfold increase in the number of sarcomeric units, as assessed by electron microscopy, an increase in cellular MLC-2 content, and a 2-3 fold increase in the steady state levels of MLC-2 mRNA. This effect of alpha-adrenergic stimulation was accompanied by a 2-3-fold increase in total transcriptional activity, which was dependent on the concentration and duration of exposure to the agonist, and displayed alpha 1-adrenergic receptor specificity. The transcriptional response was not immediate, with a lag period of at least 1 h, and a maximal effect required continuous occupancy of the receptor. The increase in steady state levels of MLC-2 mRNA is regulated, in part, at the level of transcription of the cardiac MLC-2 gene. These results suggest that alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation may be important in the growth of the neonatal heart through the activation of total transcriptional activity. In addition, increases in the levels of myofibrillar proteins during myocardial cell growth and hypertrophy, may be mediated in part by the stimulation of transcription of myofibrillar genes."
https://openalex.org/W1997876679,"Mitotic spindle disassembly requires major structural alterations in the associated cytoskeletal proteins and mitosis is known to be associated with Ca2+-sequestering phenomena and calcium transients. To examine the possible involvement of a ubiquitous Ca2+-activated protease, calpain II, in the mitotic process, synchronized PtK1 cells were monitored by immunofluorescence for the relocation of calpain II. The plasma membrane was the predominant location of calpain II in interphase. However, as mitosis progressed, calpain II relocated to (i) an association with mitotic chromosomes, (ii) a perinuclear location in anaphase, and (iii) a mid-body location in telophase. Microinjection of calpain II near the nucleus of a PtK1 cell promoted the onset of metaphase. Injection of calpain II at late metaphase promoted a precocious disassembly of the mitotic spindle and the onset of anaphase. These data suggest that calpain II is involved in mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1975016983,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) are two distinct human retroviruses that infect T cells. Recent epidemiologic studies have identified a cohort of individuals that are coinfected with both viruses. It is reported here that human peripheral blood leukocytes infected with HIV-1 in vitro can be induced to produce large quantities of HIV-1 after mitogenic stimulation by noninfectious HTLV-I virions. It is also shown that HTLV-I virions may exert this effect prior to, immediately following, or well after the cells are infected with HIV-1. These results provide further impetus for epidemiologic studies of dually infected individuals to determine whether HTLV-I may act as a cofactor for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)."
https://openalex.org/W1583309132,"A systematic study was conducted on seven recombinant plasmids harboring synthetic inserts which had all purines on one strand and all pyrimidines on the complementary strand (Pur.Pyr). The inserts ranged in G+C content from 100% [G19.C19] to 0% [A20.T20] with intermediate contents at 66% [(TCC)8.(GGA)8], 50% [(CT)12.(AG)12 and (TTCC)6.(GGAA)6], 33% [(TTC)8.(GAA)8], and 25% [(GAAA)6.(TTTC)6]. The specific reactions at the base pair level of these inserts with enzymatic (S1 and P1 nucleases) and chemical (bromoacetaldehyde, OsO4, diethyl pyrocarbonate, and dimethyl sulfate) probes were evaluated as influenced by pH, negative supercoiling, and ionic strength (NaCl). Supercoil-induced relaxation studies using two-dimensional gels also provided important conformational information. We conclude that the five inserts with 66-25% G+C adopt a non-B right-handed conformation which is stabilized by negative supercoiling. Low pH (pH values 4.5-5.0) tends to stabilize this structure but is not essential for its formation. Surprisingly, an end bias of reactivity from the center toward the 5'-end of the purine strand of these inserts was generally found for the enzymatic and chemical probes which was irrespective of the orientation of the insert in the pRW790 vector. An intramolecular triple-stranded model for the unusual structure of the insert accounts most favorably for these observations. Unexpectedly, the A20.T20 insert seems to remain in an orthodox right-handed B-conformation under all conditions tested. The G19.C19 insert does adopt a non-B right-handed structure as for the five inserts with 66-25% G+C, but the pattern of reactivities and hence its conformation is different."
https://openalex.org/W1639831160,"Immunoassays of dnaA protein in extracts from five strains showed a rather constant abundance relative to cell mass, with a variation of 800-2100 molecules/cell; overproducing cells contained 100-fold that number. About half of the dnaA protein in wild type cells was solubilized by a lysis procedure. Within the insoluble fractions, dnaA protein was identified by its characteristic high-affinity binding of ATP. An improved, rapid procedure for purifying dnaA protein from overproducing cells appears to depend on its coprecipitation with phospholipids and depends on solubilization by guanidine HCl. The procedure, with a 5-fold increased yield, also eliminates a potent ATPase contaminant. Purified dnaA protein, unlike dnaB and dnaC proteins, binds to phospholipid vesicles as judged by analysis on sucrose gradient centrifugation."
https://openalex.org/W2024938036,"The SV40 promoter is expressed well in the fission yeast S. pombe, and it initiates transcription at the same site as in mammalian cells. The majority of the enhancer sequences, however, do not contribute to this activity. DNAase I footprint analysis of the promoter revealed the presence of an AP-1-like factor in S. pombe cells that protects a region of the promoter almost identical to that protected by human AP-1. The specificity of binding of the yeast and mammalian AP-1 proteins was found to be similar. We have found two AP-1-like binding activities in budding yeast cells, one of which appears quite distinct from the binding activity of the product of the budding yeast GCN4 gene. We also demonstrate that in fission yeast the AP-1 binding site can act as an upstream activating sequence. The DNA-protein complexes containing the mammalian AP-1 and fission yeast AP-1-like factors are sensitive to phosphatase treatment, indicating that they may be phosphorylated."
https://openalex.org/W1552597422,"The gene for human apolipoprotein (apo) C-I was selected from human genomic cosmid and lambda libraries. Restriction endonuclease analysis showed that the gene for apoC-I is located 5.5 kilobases downstream of the gene for apoE. A copy of the apoC-I gene, apoC-I', is located 7.5 kilobases downstream of the apoC-I gene. Both genes contain four exons and three introns; the apoC-I gene is 4653 base pairs long, the apoC-I' gene 4387 base pairs. In each gene, the first intron is located 20 nucleotides upstream from the translation start signal; the second intron, within the codon of Gly-7 of the signal peptide region; and the third intron, within the codon for Arg39 of the mature plasma protein coding region. The upstream apoC-I gene encodes the known apoC-I plasma protein and differs from the downstream apoC-I' gene in about 9% of the exon nucleotide positions. The most important difference between the exons results in a change in the codon for Gln-2 of the signal peptide region, which introduces a translation stop signal in the downstream gene. Major sequence differences are found in the second and third introns of the apoC-I and apoC-I' genes, which contain 9 and 7.5 copies, respectively, of Alu family sequences. The apoC-I gene is expressed primarily in the liver, and it is activated when monocytes differentiate into macrophages. In contrast, no mRNA product of the apoC-I' gene can be detected in any tissue, suggesting that it may be a pseudogene. The similar structures and the proximity of the apoE and apoC-I genes suggest that they are derived from a common ancestor. Furthermore, they may be considered to be constituents of a family of seven apolipoprotein genes (apoE, -C-I, -C-II, -C-III, -A-I, -A-II, and -A-IV) that have a common evolutionary origin."
https://openalex.org/W1616137642,"Complexes previously identified in the reconstitution of stages in the initiation of replication of plasmids (oriC) bearing the origin of the Escherichia coli chromosome have been examined further. These are: (i) an ATP complex of dnaA protein, (ii) an initial complex of ATP.dnaA protein with oriC DNA, (iii) an open complex in which a portion of the oriC duplex has been opened by dnaA protein action, (iv) a prepriming complex of the open complex with dnaB, dnaC, and HU proteins, and (v) a complex with a small bubble opened at oriC by dnaB helicase action and by coating with single strand-binding protein (SSB). Helicase and gyrase actions can enlarge the bubble; coupling to priming and replication propagates bidirectional fork movement. Formation and stability of these complexes are profoundly affected by ATP, Mg2+, and temperature, as well as the levels of the participating proteins, including HU and SSB. As examples, the open complex is stable to isolation at a temperature near 38 degrees C but not at 24 degrees C; the prepriming complex requires an elevated temperature and high ATP levels for its formation, but is maintained at a low temperature and is destabilized by Mg2+. These successive steps, subject to a variety of controls, are designed to open the supercoiled duplex for priming and bidirectional replication."
https://openalex.org/W1526040448,"A hybrid gene has been constructed consisting of coding sequence for the membrane domain of the endoplasmic reticulum protein 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase linked to the coding sequence for the soluble enzyme Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase. Expression of the hybrid gene in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells results in the production of a fusion protein (HMGal) which is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. The fusion protein contains the high-mannose oligosaccharides characteristic of HMG-CoA reductase. Importantly the beta-galactosidase activity of HMGal decreases when low density lipoprotein is added to the culture media. Therefore, the membrane domain of HMG-CoA reductase is sufficient to determine both correct intracellular localization and sterol-regulation of degradation. Mutant fusion proteins which lack 64, 85, or 98 amino acid residues from within the membrane domain of HMG-CoA reductase are found to be localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and to retain beta-galactosidase activity. However, sterol-regulation of degradation is abolished."

https://openalex.org/W1509592785,"It has been suggested that sphingoid bases may serve as physiologic inhibitors of protein kinase C. Because 1,2-diacylglycerols, but not phorbol esters, enhance sphingomyelin degradation via a sphingomyelinase in GH3 pituitary cells (Kolesnick, R. N. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16759-16762), the effects of phorbol esters, 1,2-diacylglycerols, and sphingomyelinase on protein kinase C activation were assessed. Under basal conditions, the inactive cytosolic form of protein kinase C predominated. 1,2-Diacylglycerols stimulated transient protein kinase C redistribution to the membrane. 1,2-Dioctanoylglycerol (200 micrograms/ml) reduced cytosolic protein kinase C activity to 67% of control from 72 to 48 pmol.min-1.10(6) cells-1 and enhanced membrane-bound activity to 430% of control from 6 to 25 pmol.min-1.10(6) cells-1 after 4 min of stimulation. Thereafter, protein kinase C activity returned to the cytosol. In contrast, the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), stimulated redistribution to the membrane without return to the cytosol. Exogenous sphingomyelinase reduced membrane-bound protein kinase C activity to 30% of control, yet did not alter cytosolic activity. Sphingomyelinase, added after phorbol ester-induced redistribution was completed, restored activity to the cytosol. In these studies, TPA (10(-8) M) reduced cytosolic activity to 62% of control and elevated membrane-bound protein kinase C activity to 650% of control. Sphingomyelinase restored cytosolic activity to 84% of control and reduced membrane-bound activity to 297% of control. Similarly, the free sphingoid bases, sphingosine, sphinganine, and phytosphingosine, reversed phorbol ester-induced protein kinase C redistribution. Since 1,2-diacylglycerols activate a sphingomyelinase and sphingomyelinase action can reverse protein kinase C activation, these studies suggest that a pathway involving a sphingomyelinase might comprise a physiologic negative effector system for protein kinase C. Further, the failure of phorbol esters to activate this system might account for some differences between these agents."
https://openalex.org/W1991191783,"Zeins, the storage proteins of maize, are totally lacking in the essential amino acids lysine and tryptophan. Lysine codons and lysine- and tryptophan-encoding oligonucleotides were introduced at several positions into a 19-kilodalton zein complementary DNA by oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis. A 450-base pair open reading frame from a simian virus 40 (SV40) coat protein was also engineered into the zein coding region. Messenger RNAs for the modified zeins were synthesized in vitro with an SP6 RNA polymerase system and injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes. The modifications did not affect the translation, signal peptide cleavage, or stability of the zeins. The ability of the modified zeins to assemble into structures similar to maize protein bodies was assayed by two criteria: assembly into membrane-bound vesicles resistant to exogenously added protease, and ability to self-aggregate into dense structures. All of the modified zeins were membrane-bound; only the one containing a 17-kilodalton SV40 protein fragment was unable to aggregate.

When human genomic DNA was digested and probed under conditions of low stringency with a rat cDNA that encodes a Mr = 18,600 serine/glycine-rich proteoglycan peptide core in L2 yolk sac tumor cells (Bourdon, M. A., Oldberg, A., Pierschbacher, M., and Ruoslahti, E. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82, 1321-1325) and basophilic leukemia-1 cells (Avraham, S., Stevens, R. L., Gartner, M. C., Austen, K. F., Lalley, P. A., and Weis, J. H. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 7292-7296), a number of DNA fragments were identified. A HL-60 cell-derived cDNA library was therefore screened under conditions of low stringency with the rat probe to identify and isolate a human homologue of this rat proteoglycan peptide core. Analysis of the resulting human cDNA clones indicated that the proteoglycan peptide core that is expressed in HL-60 cells is Mr = 17,600 and contains an 18-amino acid glycosaminoglycan attachment region that consists primarily of alternating serin and glycine. Northern blot analysis of total RNA probed with the human cDNA revealed that the major message for this proteoglycan peptide core in HL-60 cells is approximately 1.3 kilobase pairs in size. When a Southern blot of digested human genomic DNA was probed with the human cDNA, three bands of approximately 6, 9, and 12 kilobase pairs were detected. However, when the Southern blot was probed with the XmnI----3' fragment of this human cDNA, one prominent band was detected, indicating that a single gene encodes this protein in the human. Analysis of the DNA from human/mouse and human/hamster somatic cell hybrids probed with the human cDNA demonstrated that the gene that encodes this molecule resides on human chromosome 10. Because the proteoglycans that are present in the secretory granules of different types of rat and mouse mast cells possess small peptide cores that are rich in serine and glycine, we propose that this HL-60 cell-3 derived cDNA encodes the peptide core of the proteoglycan that is expressed in the secretory granules of this human promyelocytic cell."
https://openalex.org/W1569645121,"Abstract Manganese peroxidase (MnP) is a component of the lignin degradation system of the basidiomycetous fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium. This novel MnII-dependent extracellular enzyme (Mr = 46,000) contains a single protoporphyrin IX prosthetic group and oxidizes phenolic lignin model compounds as well as a variety of other substrates. To elucidate the heme environment of this enzyme, we have studied its electron paramagnetic resonance and resonance Raman spectroscopic properties. These studies indicate that the native enzyme is predominantly in the high-spin ferric form and has a histidine as fifth ligand. The reduced enzyme has a high-spin, pentacoordinate ferrous heme. Fluoride and cyanide readily bind to the sixth coordination position of the heme iron in the native form, thereby changing MnP into a typical high-spin, hexacoordinate fluoro adduct or a low-spin, hexacoordinate cyano adduct, respectively. EPR spectra of 14NO- and 15NO-adducts of ferrous MnP were compared with those of horseradish peroxidase (HRP); the presence of a proximal histidine ligand was confirmed from the pattern of superhyperfine splittings of the NO signals centered at g approximately equal to 2.005. The appearance of the FeII-His stretch at approximately 240 cm-1 and its apparent lack of deuterium sensitivity suggest that the N delta proton of the proximal histidine of the enzyme is more strongly hydrogen bonded than that of oxygen carrier globins and that this imidazole ligand may be described as having a comparatively strong anionic character. Although resonance Raman frequencies for the spin- and coordination-state marker bands of native MnP, nu 3 (1487), nu 19 (1565), and nu 10 (1622 cm-1), do not fall into frequency regions expected for typical penta- or hexacoordinate high-spin ferric heme complexes, ligation of fluoride produces frequency shifts of these bands very similar to those observed for cytochrome c peroxidase and HRP. Hence, these data strongly suggest that the iron in native MnP is predominantly high-spin pentacoordinate. Analysis of the Raman frequencies indicates that the dx2-y2 orbital of the native enzyme is at higher energy than that of metmyoglobin. These features of the heme in MnP must be favorable for the peroxidase catalytic mechanism involving oxidation of the heme iron to FeIV. Consequently, it is most likely that the heme environment of MnP resembles those of HRP, cytochrome c peroxidase, and lignin peroxidase."
https://openalex.org/W2026904417,"The human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) types I and II have two nonstructural genes that are encoded in overlapping reading frames. One of these genes, known as tax, has been shown to encode a protein responsible for enhanced transcription (transactivation) from the viral long terminal repeats (LTRs). Genetic evidence indicates that the second nonstructural gene of HTLV-II, here designated rex, acts in trans to modulate tax gene-mediated transactivation in a concentration-dependent fashion. The rex gene may regulate the process of transactivation during the viral life cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1604919249,"The bifunctional reagents para-phenyldimaleimide and maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester were used to chemically cross-link the subunits of the transducin and cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) complexes of bovine rod photoreceptor cells. The cross-linked products were identified by Western immunoblotting using antisera against purified subunits of transducin (T alpha and T beta gamma) and PDE. Oligomeric cross-linked products of transducin subunits as large as (T alpha beta gamma)3 were observed in the latent form of transducin with bound GDP. In addition to the expected T alpha beta and T beta gamma cross-linked products, a (T alpha gamma)2 structure was detected. The close proximity of T alpha and T gamma suggests that T gamma may play a role in conferring the specificity of the interaction between T alpha and rhodopsin. Most of the oligomeric cross-linked structures between T alpha and T beta gamma were diminished in the activated form of transducin, with guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imidotriphosphate) (Gpp(NH)p) bound. However, cross-linking between T beta and T gamma was not altered. These results suggest that transducin exists as an oligomer in solution which dissociates upon the binding of Gpp(NH)p. To identify the possible interacting domains between the T alpha, T beta, and T gamma subunits, the cross-linked products were subjected to limited tryptic proteolysis. Several cross-linked tryptic peptides of transducin subunits were found and include the cross-linked products of the N terminus 15-kDa fragment of T beta and the C terminus 5-kDa fragment of T alpha, T gamma and the 12-kDa fragment of T alpha, T gamma and the 15-kDa as well as the 23-kDa fragments of T beta, and an intra-T alpha cross-linked product of the 2- and 21-kDa fragments. These results have allowed the construction of a topographical model for the transducin subunits. The organization of the subunits of PDE (P alpha, P beta, and P gamma) was also studied. The formation of the high molecular size cross-linked products of PDE resulted in the concurrent loss of the P beta and P gamma subunits, suggesting that they are in close proximity. Finally, the interaction between transducin and PDE was examined by chemical cross-linking of transducin-Gpp(NH)p and PDE. Two additional cross-linked products of 180 and 210 kDa were obtained which could be due to the cross-linking of T alpha or T beta with P alpha beta subunits.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1501607713,"The ADP/ATP carrier of yeast (309 amino acids) is an abundant transmembrane protein of the mitochondrial inner membrane whose import involves well-defined steps (Pfanner, N., and Neupert, W. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 7528-7536). Analysis of the in vitro import of gene fusion products containing ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) sequences at the amino terminus and mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) at the carboxyl terminus indicates that the first 72 amino acids of the soluble carrier protein, a hydrophilic region of the protein, are not by themselves sufficient for initial binding to the AAC receptor on the mitochondrial surface. However, an AAC-DHFR gene fusion containing the first 111 residues of the ADP/ATP carrier protein exhibited binding to mitochondria at low temperature (2 degrees C) and internalization at 25 degrees C to a mitochondrial space protected from proteinase K in the same manner as the wild-type ADP/ATP carrier protein. The AAC-DHFR protein, in contrast to the wild-type AAC protein imported into mitochondria under optimal conditions, remained extractable at alkaline pH and appeared to be blocked at an intermediate step in the AAC import pathway. Based on its extraction properties, this AAC-DHFR hybrid is proposed to be associated with a proteinaceous component of the import apparatus within mitochondria. These data indicate that the import determinants for the AAC protein are not located at its extreme amino terminus and that protein determinants distal to the first 111 residues of the carrier may be necessary to move the protein beyond the alkali-extractable step in the biogenesis of a functional AAC protein."
https://openalex.org/W1604679503,"Insulin receptor halves (alpha beta) were obtained upon selective reduction of the holoreceptor (alpha 2 beta 2) and were isolated in concentrated form. Autophosphorylation of concentrated alpha beta receptor halves can be stimulated by insulin an average of 4.0-fold, whereas nonreduced holoreceptor can be stimulated 5.4-fold. If alpha beta half-receptors are immobilized on wheat germ agglutinin-agarose, no insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation is observed, whereas immobilized holoreceptor retains insulin responsiveness. Treatment of alpha beta half-receptors with glutathione in the presence of insulin results in reoxidation to the holoreceptor form (alpha 2 beta 2) with an efficiency of 60-70% as visualized by immunoblotting, thus providing evidence that two alpha beta halves are in close physical proximity. This reoxidation reaction, which is evident prior to autophosphorylation, is rapid and strictly dependent on the presence of insulin, consistent with the hypothesis that insulin promotes the association of two alpha beta halves. Furthermore, the insulin-induced reoxidation reaction and the insulin-induced autophosphorylation show the same dose dependence ED50 3-4 x 10(-8) M insulin), suggesting that the noncovalent association of alpha beta half-receptors upon insulin binding is a prerequisite for insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation in concentrated alpha beta half-receptor preparations. If the alpha beta half-receptor forms are phosphorylated in the presence of an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and separated from nonphosphorylated alpha beta receptors, we observed that the phosphorylated alpha beta receptor halves contain bound insulin. This excludes the possibility that alpha beta half-receptors that bind insulin, preferentially phosphorylate alpha beta halves that have no insulin bound."
https://openalex.org/W1563840215,"Mammalian testis contains two forms of cytochrome c, one identical to the form found in somatic tissues and a second that is expressed in a stage-specific manner during spermatogenic differentiation. We have isolated both rat and mouse cDNA clones and the rat gene encoding the testis-specific cytochrome c and determined their DNA sequences. The testicular variant displays a number of notable differences with its somatic counterpart. 1) In contrast to the multipseudogene family derived from mammalian somatic cytochrome c genes, the testis gene is single-copy in genomic DNA with no detectable pseudogenes. 2) The rat testis gene is approximately 7 kilobases (kb) long with three introns totaling nearly 6.5 kb whereas the two introns dividing the 2.1-kb somatic gene occupy only 0.9 kb. Introns differ in position as well as size. 3) The testicular variant has a longer 5'-untranslated leader (230 versus 70 base pairs for the somatic gene) with an upstream open reading frame of 129 base pairs beginning with an AUG in a favorable translational context. 4) A single polyadenylation site in the testicular mRNA (approximately 900 nucleotides) contrasts with the three functionally equivalent sites observed in rat somatic messages. 5) Finally, rat and mouse testis cytochromes c differ at 4 amino acid residues as opposed to the complete sequence identity found in the somatic proteins suggesting a shorter unit evolutionary period for these molecules. These observations are consistent with a duplication of an ancestral cytochrome c gene leading to the emergence of novel structural features and regulatory properties likely associated with the striking tissue specificity of the testicular cytochrome c."
https://openalex.org/W1506316133,"Following studies on calcium transport by isolated smooth endoplasmic reticulum from unfertilized sea urchin eggs (Oberdorf, J. A., Head, J. F., and Kaminer, B. (1986) J. Cell Biol. 102, 2205-2210) we have purified and partially characterized a calsequestrin-like protein from this organelle isolated from eggs from Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis and Arbacia punctulata. Muscle calsequestrin from sarcoplasmic reticulum is well characterized as a calcium storage protein. The egg protein resembles calsequestrin in its behavior in purification steps, electrophoretic mobility, blue staining with Stains-all on polyacrylamide gels, and its calcium binding and amino acid composition. Purification was attained with DEAE-cellulose and hydroxyapatite chromatography. The egg protein Mr of 58,000 in the Laemmli gel system is reduced to 54,000 under Weber-Osborn (neutral) conditions, thus showing a pH dependence in its mobility, although less than occurs with muscle calsequestrins. 25% of its amino acids are acidic and 10% basic. It binds 309 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein, within the range reported for cardiac calsequestrin. Antigenically, the sea urchin egg protein is related to cardiac calsequestrin capable of binding anti-cardiac calsequestrin antibody."
https://openalex.org/W1580645402,"The capacities of four synthetic sequences containing runs of perfectly alternating purine-pyrimidine base pairs (bp) to adopt left-handed structures were evaluated in a homologous family of recombinant plasmids. All the sequences had the same G+C content (50%) and consisted of simple tetranucleotide repeat units but differed in the relative orientations of these units. For some of the sequences, several alternate secondary structures were theoretically possible; a variety of probes (S1 nuclease, bromoacetaldehyde, OsO4, T7 gene 3 endonuclease, supercoil-induced gel relaxation studies) under a wide range of reaction conditions was used to determine which structures were adopted as a function of superhelical stress. The precise positions at the bp level of reactions with these chemical and enzymatic probes were determined. We conclude that for short (20-24 bp) sequences containing runs of alternating (T-G) and (C-A), the cruciform state is preferred over the similarly allowable left-handed form provided that symmetry constraints allow. However, these sequences can be induced to form a left-handed helix under appropriate conditions. This is the first demonstration of plasmid inserts which will adopt more than one unusual DNA structure in response to negative superhelical stress. The structural properties of a molecule containing a Z-Z junction were studied, and we conclude that the disruption caused by this feature extends over only a few bp although it requires a high energetic penalty."
https://openalex.org/W1500549738,"Gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) is a peptide hormone containing 27 amino acids which is structurally analogous to the amphibian peptide bombesin. GRP serves a variety of physiological functions and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of small cell lung cancer. Previous work has demonstrated that the modified C terminus of GRP, N-acetyl-GRP-20-27, exerts full agonist activity in a variety of assay systems. However, no systematic comparison of binding of GRP fragments to its receptor and mitogenic potency has been reported. To investigate whether smaller GRP fragments could bind to the GRP receptor without stimulating mitogenesis, we performed binding inhibition and thymidine uptake assays with Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. These studies were facilitated by the development of a novel tritiated GRP-based radioligand, [3H-Phe15] GRP-15-27, which exhibits enhanced chemical stability compared to iodinated GRP derivatives. We examined a series of C-terminal GRP fragments, from the pentapeptide to the octapeptide, with both N-acetyl and free amine moieties at the N terminus. N-Acetylated derivatives were more potent than their primary amine counterparts in both assays. Deletion of N-terminal residues from GRP-20-27 resulted in significant loss of potency in both assays: the EC50 values of N-acetyl-GRP-21-27 were 10(2)-fold higher than N-acetyl-GRP-20-27, those of N-acetyl-GRP-22-27 were 10(4)-fold higher, and N-acetyl-GRP-23-27 showed minimal activity at concentrations below 100 microM. These results suggest that 1) both His20 and Trp21 play an important role in binding of GRP to the receptor, and 2) for this series of N-terminal deletions, binding to the receptor and mitogenic activity are tightly coupled."
https://openalex.org/W1589118081,"RecA protein from Escherichia coli promotes homologous pairing and strand exchange between duplex DNA molecules if one is partially single-stranded. Using linear duplexes and circles with a single-stranded gap as the substrates, this reaction generates nicked circular heteroduplex DNA and linear molecules with single-stranded ends. The completion of strand exchange can be demonstrated by the production of nicked circular heteroduplex DNA detected by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography using radiolabeled linear molecules. When the effect of ultraviolet damage to the substrate DNA was tested, strand exchange was found to pass 30 or more pyrimidine dimers in each duplex. In contrast, exchanges were blocked or severely slowed by interstrand cross-links and monoadducts produced by psoralen and 360 nm light. Deletions and insertions of from 4 to 38 base pairs in the DNA substrates had little effect on the production of nicked circular heteroduplex DNA. However, those of 120 base pairs, or greater, reduced the product yield to a level below the threshold of detection. These results contrast with those obtained in related three-stranded reactions (Bianchi, M. E., and Radding, C. M. (1984) Cell 35, 511-520), in which stable heteroduplex products with 500 or 1300 unpaired bases were obtained when the insert was located within a single-stranded circular substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1571033583,"The regulatory site peptide sequence of phosphorylated inactive pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase from maize leaf tissue was determined by automated Edman degradation analysis of 32P-labeled peptides purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The overlapping phosphopeptides were products of a digestion of the [beta-32P]ADP-inactivated dikinase with either trypsin or Pronase E. The sequence is Thr-Glu-Arg-Gly-Gly-Met-Thr(P)-Ser-His-Ala-Ala-Val-Val-Ala-Arg. The phosphothreonine residue, which appeared as either an anomalous proline or an unidentifiable phenylthiohydantoin derivative during sequencing, was verified by two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis of the phosphopeptides and by resequencing the tryptic peptide after dephosphorylation with exogenous alkaline phosphatase. This sequence, starting at position 4, is completely homologous to the previously published sequence of the tryptic dodecapeptide harboring the catalytically essential (phospho)histidyl residue in the active-site domain of the dikinase from the nonphotosynthetic bacterium, Bacteroides symbiosus (Goss, N.H., Evans, C.T., and Wood, H.G. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 5805-5809). These comparative results indicate that the regulatory phosphothreonine causing complete inactivation of maize leaf dikinase is separated from the critical active-site (phospho)histidine by just one intervening residue in the primary sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1589029768,"Amiloride is a reversible inhibitor of the Na+/H+ antiporter which acts at the external aspect of the transport system. The kinetics of inhibition of the Na+/H+ antiporter with amiloride have been controversial, with the usual finding of simple competitive inhibition, but with other reports of mixed and noncompetitive inhibition of the transporter by amiloride. The present experiments demonstrate that the chloride content of the external transport buffer affects the kinetics of amiloride inhibition. Either simple competitive or mixed inhibition by amiloride was observed in the same vesicle preparations depending on the presence of chloride or gluconate in the buffer. The effect of chloride on the inhibitory effect of amiloride was dependent on the concentration of chloride and amiloride. Similar effects were observed with more potent analogues of amiloride. These findings suggest that the external aspect of the antiporter has a site or sites at which the inhibitory effects of amiloride on the Na+/H+ antiporter can be modified by chloride, even though chloride has only slight effects on the kinetics of the Na+/H+ antiporter in the absence of amiloride."
https://openalex.org/W1534929651,"Abstract The number of different tRNA species in Saccharomyces cerevisiae known to be capable of suppressing termination of translation at UAG, UAA, and UGA codons is limited to those which insert tyrosine, leucine, and serine. Suppressor tRNAs that insert other amino acids, even those whose anticodons differ from the expected recognition sequences for nonsense codons by a single nucleotide, have never been identified via classical genetic analysis. We have used site-directed mutagenesis to convert the anticodon of a cloned tRNATrp gene from CCA to CTA with the expectation that this gene would produce tRNA molecules capable of interacting with the UAG terminator codon. We show that this form of the gene can be transcribed and spliced in vitro to produce mature tRNA with the expected base sequence. The putative suppressor gene has been introduced into several S. cerevisiae host strains using the centromere vector YCp19. Efficient suppression of amber mutations met8-1, tyr7-1, and lys2-801 results from the presence of the CTA form of tDNATrp. Two UAA mutants, leu2-1 and ade2-101, and the UGA marker his4-260 are not suppressed."
https://openalex.org/W2202640308,"We have previously shown that in a murine pre-B lymphocyte cell line, 70Z/3, interleukin-1-induced IgM expression (differentiation) was associated with Na+/H+-mediated cytoplasmic alkalinization. Because interferon-gamma also induces 70Z/3 differentiation, in this study we examined the effects of recombinant murine interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma) on cell pH. We found that rIFN-gamma (50 units/ml) induced a sustained increase in cell pH, averaging 0.09 pH units above the base line at 30 min and 0.08 at 4 h. Because rIFN-gamma also induced increases in cell Na+ concentration, the data suggests stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange across the cell membrane. Amiloride inhibited the rIFN-gamma-mediated pH rise by only 31% at 30 min, but at 4 h the inhibition was more complete (89%). In contrast to pHi, amiloride totally blocked the Na+ rise at both 30 min and 4 h. This indicates that at the earlier time point the pH rise had a Na+/H+ exchange-dependent and -independent component while at the later time most of the pH rise was due to the Na+/H+ exchanger. The presence of a Na+ independent amiloride-insensitive component was further confirmed by the 0.05 pH rise induced by rIFN-gamma in Na+-free media. Failure to block the Na+-independent rIFN-gamma-mediated pHi rise by anion exchange inhibitors or removal of Ca2+ indicate that this component was not mediated by Cl-/OH- or Ca2+/H+ exchange. The nature of the Na+-independent cell alkalinization process or its role in rIFN-gamma-mediated 70Z/3 differentiation remains to be determined. Because amiloride did not have an effect on rIFN-gamma-induced surface Ig expression or the rIFN-gamma-mediated increase in new kappa light chain-specific mRNA the results indicate that rIFN-gamma-stimulated Na+/H+ is not required for 70Z/3 differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W1502726639,"Changes in Na+/H+ antiport activity and transepithelial electrical resistance were analyzed in a clone of LLC-PK1 cells as the dispersed cells became organized into an epithelial membrane. The clone designated LLC-PK1A showed a 250% increase in Na+/H+ exchange activity as compared with the parent cell line. Na+ influx induced by an outwardly oriented H+ gradient is almost completely abolished during active cell proliferation or after cell dispersion. The activity of the Na+/H+ antiport system increases after plating the cells at high density. This increase precedes the increase in the transepithelial electrical resistance. The increase in the Na+/H+ antiport activity was not observed when the cells were plated at low density in the presence of an antimitotic agent indicating that close cell contact is an absolute requirement for the development of the system. The increase in Na+ influx correlated with an increase in Vmax, while the Km for Na+ remained essentially unchanged. Unidirectional Na+ influx measured from the apical or basolateral side as the dispersed cells became reorganized into an epithelial membrane indicated that the insertion of the Na+/H+ antiporter proteins occurred directly in the apical membrane of the epithelial cells. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that the sorting of native proteins occurs intracellularly prior to their insertion in the apical membrane of the epithelial cells. The delay in the increase of transepithelial electrical resistance as compared with the increase in Na+ influx indicates that the settlement of the limits between the apical and basolateral membrane (fence function) precedes the closing of the intercellular space (barrier function) during the development of the occluding junctions. Further, the development of the Na+/H+ antiporter was inhibited by cycloheximide but not by actinomycin D, suggesting that the expression of epithelial cell polarization is a translational or posttranslational event."
