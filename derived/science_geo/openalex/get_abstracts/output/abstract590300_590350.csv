https://openalex.org/W2725296099,"Gut lumen serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine: 5-HT) contributes to several gastrointestinal functions such as peristaltic reflexes. 5-HT is released from enterochromaffin (EC) cells in response to a number of stimuli, including signals from the gut microbiota. However, the specific mechanism by which the gut microbiota regulates 5-HT levels in the gut lumen has not yet been clarified. Our previous work with gnotobiotic mice showed that free catecholamines can be produced by the deconjugation of conjugated catecholamines; hence, we speculated that deconjugation by bacterial enzymes may be one of the mechanisms whereby gut microbes can produce free 5-HT in the gut lumen. In this study, we tested this hypothesis using germ-free (GF) mice and gnotobiotic mice recolonized with specific pathogen-free (SPF) fecal flora (EX-GF). The 5-HT levels in the lumens of the cecum and colon were significantly lower in the GF mice than in the EX-GF mice. Moreover, these levels were rapidly increased, within only 3 days after exposure to SPF microbiota. The majority of 5-HT was in an unconjugated, free form in the EX-GF mice, whereas approximately 50% of the 5-HT was found in the conjugated form in the GF mice. These results further support the current view that the gut microbiota plays a crucial role in promoting the production of biologically active, free 5-HT. The deconjugation of glucuronide-conjugated 5-HT by bacterial enzymes is likely one of the mechanisms contributing to free 5-HT production in the gut lumen."

Recent studies have reported the beneficial role of BF in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, stimulating host immunologic development, and preventing infectious colitis caused by pathogenic bacteria. Our previous studies showed that monocolonization of germ-free mice with BF significantly reduced colon inflammations and damage. Methods In order to investigate the Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2), TLR4, and interleukin 10 (IL-10) molecular signaling pathways involved in BF-mediated prevention of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. The wild-type (WT), TLR4, TLR2, and IL-10 knockout (-/-) germ-free mice grown were with or without BF colonization for 28 days, and then administered 1% DSS in drinking water for 7 day to induce acute ulcerative colitis. Results We compared phenotypes such as weight loss, disease activity, intestinal histological scores, and immunohistochemistry for inflammatory cells. Unlike WT and TLR4-/- mice, the severity of DSS-colitis did not improve in TLR2-/- animals after BF colonization. The BF enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 expression and inhibited pro-inflammatory-related tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and IL-6 mRNA expression in both WT and TLR4-/- mice. In contrast, the failed to up-regulated IL-10 and down-regulated the TNF-α and IL-6 in BF colonization TLR2-/- mice. In addition, we further perform IL-10-/- mice to clarify whether the BF through TLR2 /IL-10 pathway to alleviate DSS-colitis. There were no significant differences in colitis severity and pro-inflammatory related genes expression in the IL-10-/- mice with or without BF colonization. Conclusions These results indicate the disease-preventing effects of BF in acute DSS-induced colitis may occur through the TLR2/IL-10 signal pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2728538683,"This paper examined, with a behavioral paradigm, to what extent people choose to view stimuli that portray death, violence or harm. Based on briefly presented visual cues, participants made choices between highly arousing, negative images and positive or negative alternatives. The negative images displayed social scenes that involved death, violence or harm (e.g., war scene), or decontextualized, close-ups of physical harm (e.g., mutilated face) or natural threat (e.g., attacking shark). The results demonstrated that social negative images were chosen significantly more often than other negative categories. Furthermore, participants preferred social negative images over neutral images. Physical harm images and natural threat images were not preferred over neutral images, but were chosen in about thirty-five percent of the trials. These results were replicated across three different studies, including a study that presented verbal descriptions of images as pre-choice cues. Together, these results show that people deliberately subject themselves to negative images. With this, the present paper demonstrates a dynamic relationship between negative information and behavior and advances new insights into the phenomenon of morbid curiosity."
https://openalex.org/W2734173896,"Psychopathy is a personality disorder with strong links to criminal behavior. While research on psychopathy has focused largely on socio-affective dysfunction, recent data suggest that aberrant decision making may also play an important role. Yet, the circuit-level mechanisms underlying maladaptive decision making in psychopathy remain unclear. Here, we used a multi-modality functional imaging approach to identify these mechanisms in a population of adult male incarcerated offenders. Psychopathy was associated with stronger subjective value-related activity within the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) during inter-temporal choice and with weaker intrinsic functional connectivity between NAcc and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). NAcc-vmPFC connectivity strength was negatively correlated with NAcc subjective value-related activity; however, this putative regulatory pattern was abolished as psychopathy severity increased. Finally, weaker cortico-striatal regulation predicted more frequent criminal convictions. These data suggest that cortico-striatal circuit dysregulation drives maladaptive decision making in psychopathy, supporting the notion that reward system dysfunction comprises an important neurobiological risk factor."
https://openalex.org/W2724948078,"The apolipoprotein-ε4 allele (APOE-ε4) is strongly associated with detrimental outcomes in affluent populations including atherosclerotic disease, Alzheimer's disease, and reduced lifespan. Despite these detrimental outcomes, population frequencies of APOE-ε4 are high. We hypothesize that the high frequency of APOE-ε4 was maintained because of beneficial effects during evolution when infectious pathogens were more prevalent and a major cause of mortality. We examined a rural Ghanaian population with a high pathogen exposure for selective advantages of APOE-ε4, to survival and or fertility.This rural Ghanaian population (n = 4311) has high levels of mortality from widespread infectious diseases which are the main cause of death. We examined whether APOE-ε4 was associated with survival (total follow-up time was 30,262 years) and fertility after stratifying by exposure to high or low pathogen levels. Households drawing water from open wells and rivers were classified as exposed to high pathogen levels while low pathogen exposure was classified as those drawing water from borehole wells. We found a non-significant, but positive survival benefit, i.e. the hazard ratio per APOE-ε4 allele was 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.69 to 1.05), adjusted for sex, tribe, and socioeconomic status. Among women aged 40 years and older (n = 842), APOE-ε4 was not associated with the lifetime number of children. However, APOE-ε4 was associated with higher fertility in women exposed to high pathogen levels. Compared with women not carrying an APOE-ε4 allele, those carrying one APOE-ε4 allele had on average one more child and those carrying two APOE-ε4 alleles had 3.5 more children (p = 0.018).Contrary to affluent modern-day populations, APOE-ε4 did not carry a survival disadvantage in this rural Ghanaian population. Moreover, APOE-ε4 promotes fertility in highly infectious environments. Our findings suggest that APOE-ε4 may be considered as evolutionarily adaptive. Its adverse associations in affluent modern populations with later onset diseases of aging further characterize APOE-ε4 as an example of antagonistic pleiotropy."
https://openalex.org/W2731882942,"Objective Although most HIV-infected individuals achieve undetectable viremia during antiretroviral therapy (ART), a subset have low-level viremia (LLV) of varying duration and magnitude. The impact of LLV on treatment outcomes is unclear. We investigated the association between LLV and virological failure and/or all-cause mortality among Swedish patients receiving ART. Methods HIV-infected patients from two Swedish HIV centers were identified from the nationwide register InfCare HIV. Subjects aged ≥15 years with triple agent ART were included at 12 months after treatment initiation if ≥2 following viral load measurements were available. Patients with 2 consecutive HIV RNA values ≥1000 copies/mL at this time point were excluded. Participants were stratified into four categories depending on viremia profiles: permanently suppressed viremia (<50 copies/mL), LLV 50–199 copies/mL, LLV 200–999 copies/mL and viremia ≥1000 copies/mL. Association between all four viremia categories and all-cause death was calculated using survival analysis with viremia as a time-varying covariate, so that patients could change viremia category during follow-up. Association between the three lower categories and virological failure (≥2 consecutive measurements ≥1000 copies/mL) was calculated in a similar manner. Results LLV 50–199 copies/mL was recorded in 70/1015 patients (6.9%) and LLV 200–999 copies/mL in 89 (8.8%) during 7812 person-years of follow-up (median 6.5 years). LLV 200–999 copies/mL was associated with virological failure (adjusted hazard ratio 3.14 [95% confidence interval 1.41–7.03, p<0.01]), whereas LLV 50–199 copies/mL was not (1.01 [0.34–4.31, p = 0.99]; median follow-up 4.5 years). LLV 200–999 copies/mL had an adjusted mortality hazard ratio of 2.29 (0.98–5.32, p = 0.05) and LLV 50–199 copies/mL of 2.19 (0.90–5.37, p = 0.09). Conclusions In this Swedish cohort followed during ART for a median of 4.5 years, LLV 200–999 copies/mL was independently associated with virological failure. Patients with LLV had higher rates of all-cause mortality, although not statistically significant in multivariate analysis."

How does the brain associate a social context with odor signals to promote memory encoding? Here we show that odor exposure during STFP, but not unconditioned odor exposure, induces glomerulus-specific long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength selectively at the GABAergic component of dendrodendritic synapses of granule and mitral cells in the olfactory bulb. Conditional deletion of synaptotagmin-10, the Ca2+ sensor for IGF1 secretion from mitral cells, or deletion of IGF1 receptor in the olfactory bulb prevented the socially relevant GABAergic LTP and impaired memory formation after STFP. Conversely, the addition of IGF1 to acute olfactory bulb slices elicited the GABAergic LTP in mitral cells by enhancing postsynaptic GABA receptor responses. Thus, our data reveal a synaptic substrate for a socially conditioned long-term memory that operates at the level of the initial processing of sensory information.

Learning from conspecifics is prevalent among social animals (Gariépy et al., 2014Gariépy J.F. Watson K.K. Du E. Xie D.L. Erb J. Amasino D. Platt M.L. Social learning in humans and other animals.Front. Neurosci. 2014; 8: 58PubMed Google Scholar). For example, after only a single trial of olfactory social learning, rodents form long-term memories of their mates, territories, and safe foods, all of which are essential for survival (Galef, 1982Galef Jr., B.G. Studies of social learning in Norway rats: a brief review.Dev. Psychobiol. 1982; 15: 279-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, Brennan et al., 1990Brennan P. Kaba H. Keverne E.B.

Hambucken A. Trifilieff P. Bontempi B. Early tagging of cortical networks is required for the formation of enduring associative memory.Science. 2011; 331: 924-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Social context, consisting of a diverse repertoire of socially relevant chemical and physical signals, plays a fundamental role in these behavioral paradigms. How the brain associates social context with sensory stimuli to encode memory during social learning is a long-standing and unresolved question. Two series of seminal studies provide important clues. First, Keverne and colleagues (Brennan et al., 1990Brennan P. Kaba H. Keverne E.B. Olfactory recognition: a simple memory system.Science. 1990; 250: 1223-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, Keverne and Brennan, 1996Keverne E.B. Brennan P.A. Olfactory recognition memory.J. Physiol. Paris. 1996; 90: 399-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) demonstrated that pheromone-dependent social recognition memory is associated with a potentiation of GABAergic feedback inhibition between granule and mitral cells in mouse accessory olfactory bulb. However, the nature of the synaptic changes that were observed remained unclear, as did the underlying molecular mechanisms and behavioral relevance of these changes. Second, socially acquired food preference depends on the association of food odors with semiochemicals (e.g., carbon disulfide) in the main olfactory bulb (MOB) of rodents (Galef et al., 1988Galef Jr., B.G. Mason J.R. Preti G. Bean N.J. Carbon disulfide: a semiochemical mediating socially-induced diet choice in rats.Physiol.

Biol. 2010; 20: 1438-1444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), but the synaptic substrate for such association was not identified yet. These two observations suggest that the neural substrate for association of sensory cues with social context in rodent brain may exist in the olfactory system. In the main olfactory system of vertebrates, odor information is sequentially processed in the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) and the MOB. In the MOE, each olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) expresses one particular odorant receptor that can detect a limited number of odorants at physiological concentrations (Buck and Axel, 1991Buck L.

A novel multigene family may encode odorant receptors: a molecular basis for odor recognition.Cell. 1991; 65: 175-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3672) Google Scholar, Serizawa et al., 2003Serizawa S.

Negative feedback regulation ensures the one receptor-one olfactory neuron rule in mouse.Science. 2003; 302: 2088-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Axons from the OSNs that express the same odorant receptor converge onto one or two glomerluli in each MOB, forming a two-dimensional olfactory sensory map (Ressler et al., 1994Ressler K.J.

Carleton A. Dense representation of natural odorants in the mouse olfactory bulb.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 537-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the MOB, the glomerular layer (GL) and the external plexiform layer (EPL) represent two major stations for olfactory information processing (Uchida et al., 2014Uchida N. Poo C. Haddad R. Coding and transformations in the olfactory system.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 37: 363-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the GL, OSNs provide excitatory input to the primary dendrites of 20–50 mitral/tufted (M/T) cells, the major output neurons of the MOB (Shepherd et al., 2004Shepherd G.M. Chen W.R. Greer C.A. Olfactory bulb.in: Shepherd G.M. The Synaptic Organization of the Brain. Oxford University Press, 2004: 165-217Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Notably, olfactory signals are not simply relayed from OSNs to M/T cells, but they are processed in the glomeruli by a complex neuronal network formed by periglomerular (PG) neurons, OSNs, and M/T cells (De Saint Jan et al., 2009De Saint Jan D.

In the EPL, the lateral dendrites of M/T cells elaborate dendrodendritic synapses with inhibitory interneurons, such as granule cells (Shepherd et al., 2007Shepherd G.M. Chen W.R. Willhite D. Migliore M. Greer C.A. The olfactory granule cell: from classical enigma to central role in olfactory processing.Brain Res. Brain Res.

Dendrodendritic synapses between M/T cells and granule cells are reciprocal; the lateral dendrite of an M/T cell forms an excitatory synapse on the dendrite of a granule cell, which then forms an inhibitory synapse onto the lateral dendrite of the M/T cell in an immediate feedback loop (Jahr and Nicoll, 1980Jahr C.E.

Evidence from morphological, functional, and modeling studies suggests that intrabulbar neurons are clustered to form glomerular units (Stewart et al., 1979Stewart W.B. Kauer J.S. Shepherd G.M.

The different types of neurons associated with the same glomerular unit share similar profiles of olfactory tuning with varied tuning sharpness and spike timing (Tan et al., 2010Tan J. Savigner A.

Odorant response properties of individual neurons in an olfactory glomerular module.Neuron. 2013; 77: 1122-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Such modular organization of microcircuits in the MOB provides an opportunity to identify glomerulus-specific mechanisms underlying social learning. Here we used social transmission of food preference (STFP) as a social learning paradigm (Galef, 2003Galef Jr., B.G. Social learning of food preferences in rodents: rapid appetitive learning.Curr. Protoc. Neurosci. 2003; Chapter 8: Unit 8.5DPubMed Google Scholar, Wrenn, 2004Wrenn C.C. Social transmission of food preference in mice.Curr. Protoc. Neurosci. 2004; Chapter 8: Unit 8.5GPubMed Google Scholar) to study the synaptic mechanism for the association of sensory cues with social context in the MOB. We found that STFP induced a significant, long-lasting, and selective strengthening, referred to as long-term potentiation (LTP), of reciprocal synapses between granule and mitral cells associated with the glomerular unit sensitive to the memorized odors. Strikingly, odor exposure without a social context did not induce this LTP. This LTP required activity-dependent IGF1 signaling and was essential for memory formation. Thus, our data reveal a synaptic substrate that associates social context with sensory cues for memory encoding during social learning. To analyze synapses of mitral cells associated with a specific glomerular unit, we used gene-targeted M72-GFP mice in which M72 glomeruli innervated by axon terminals of GFP+ M72 OSNs are fluorescently labeled (Potter et al., 2001Potter S.M. Zheng C. Koos D.S. Feinstein P. Fraser S.E. Mombaerts P. Structure and emergence of specific olfactory glomeruli in the mouse.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9713-9723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). M72 OSNs are sensitive to acetophenone (Acp) but insensitive to octanal (Oct) (Zhang et al., 2012Zhang J. Huang G. Dewan A. Feinstein P. Bozza T. Uncoupling stimulus specificity and glomerular position in the mouse olfactory system.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2012; 51: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). During STFP training, M72-GFP observer mice interacted with demonstrator mice that had ingested plain food, Acp-flavored food, or Oct-flavored food (both at 1%). We then prepared acute MOB slices (300 μm) from the M72-GFP observer mice immediately or 14 days after STFP training, and we performed whole-cell recordings from M72-associated mitral cells (Figure 1A). In parallel behavioral experiments, we confirmed that the mice had formed a long-term memory of the food odor after STFP training (Figures S1A–S1C). In our experiments, we routinely analyzed three types of synapses formed on M72-associated mitral cells: (1) excitatory synapses formed by M72 OSNs (OS-M synapses), (2) inhibitory synapses formed by PG neurons in the local neuronal network of the M72 glomerulus (PG-M synapses), and (3) dendrodendritic reciprocal synapses formed by mitral and granule cells (M-G-M synapses) (Figure 1B). For studying excitatory OS-M and inhibitory PG-M synapses, we delivered low-frequency (0.067 Hz) stimulation with a bipolar electrode placed adjacent to the GFP+ M72 glomerulus, and we recorded excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) (with picrotoxin in the artificial cerebrospinal fluid [ACSF]) and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) (with D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid [D-AP5] and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione [CNQX] in the ACSF) from M72-associated mitral cells (Figures S1D–S1H; Vaaga and Westbrook, 2016Vaaga C.E. Westbrook G.L. Parallel processing of afferent olfactory sensory information.J. Physiol. 2016; 594: 6715-6732Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For examining M-G-M synapses, we recorded recurrent IPSCs from M72-associated mitral cells in the absence of receptor antagonists, using the same patch-clamp pipette for stimulations (10-ms membrane depolarization from −70 to 0 mV) and recordings (Figures S2A and S2B; Isaacson and Strowbridge, 1998Isaacson J.S.

In addition, we separately monitored the inhibitory G-M and excitatory M-G sub-synapses of the M-G-M dendrodendritic synapses. Using bipolar stimulation electrodes placed in the granule cell layer, we recorded G-M IPSCs from M72-associated mitral cells in the presence of D-AP5 and CNQX (Figures S2F–S2H) and M-G EPSCs from granule cells in the presence of picrotoxin (Figures S2I and S2J). Finally, in selected experiments we also recorded M72-associated mitral cell IPSCs that were evoked by optogenetic activation of PV+ interneurons expressing ChR2-EYFP (Figures S2C–S2E; Kato et al., 2013Kato H.K.

Several concerns about the specificity of these recordings may be raised. First, are we faithfully recording from mitral cells associated with GFP+ M72 glomeruli? In M72-GFP mice, ∼20–50 mitral cells innervate each of the four GFP+ M72 glomeruli (Tan et al., 2010Tan J. Savigner A. Ma M. Luo M.

Odorant response properties of individual neurons in an olfactory glomerular module.Neuron. 2013; 77: 1122-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), thus ensuring that most mitral neurons in the vicinity of a glomerulus actually innervate that glomerulus. Nevertheless, to ensure that patched mitral cells were associated with the M72 glomerulus, we verified this association by neurobiotin injections and histology after recordings (Tan et al., 2010Tan J. Savigner A. Ma M. Luo M. Odor information processing by the olfactory bulb analyzed in gene-targeted mice.Neuron. 2010; 65: 912-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Only mitral cells with fluorescent primary dendrites innervating the GFP+ M72 glomerulus (Figure 1C) were included in the analyses. Second, quantification of synaptic responses induced by extracellular stimulation in slices is difficult since the number of stimulated synapses cannot be controlled. Therefore, we based our measurements of synaptic strength on input/output curves, and we calculated synaptic strength as the slope of the input/output curve. Moreover, we used as controls slices from naive mice and from mice exposed to Oct, which is not an M72 ligand; the fact that the synaptic strength of these two controls was similar under all conditions validates the measurements (see below in Figures 1D–1G). Third, do our recordings actually monitor the intended synapses? Considering the combination of electrode placements with pharmacological antagonists, this seems likely. However, it should be noted that, given the complex neuronal network in olfactory glomeruli, the measured synaptic responses for OS-M and PG-M synapses are probably not exclusively monosynaptic (De Saint Jan et al., 2009De Saint Jan D.

Three-dimensional synaptic analyses of mitral cell and external tufted cell dendrites in rat olfactory bulb glomeruli.J. Comp. Neurol. 2017; 525: 592-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that OS-M EPSCs exhibited a complex waveform (Figure S1F), consisting of a transient mono-synaptic phase (latency to peak: 4.2 ± 0.2 ms) followed by a long-lasting decay phase (decay-to-baseline time: 1.35 ± 0.3 s; Figures S1I–S1K). This broad waveform likely arises because OSNs form direct excitatory contacts with the dendrites of both mitral and external tufted cells, with the dendrites additionally connected by gap junctions (Vaaga and Westbrook, 2016Vaaga C.E. Westbrook G.L. Parallel processing of afferent olfactory sensory information.J. Physiol. 2016; 594: 6715-6732Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, Bourne and Schoppa, 2017Bourne J.N.

Thus, although we refer to OS-M and PG-M synapses, we mean to imply with this term that the respective synaptic responses reflect the overall synaptic strength of the OSN/mitral cell and the PG neuron/mitral cell connections, and not necessarily a simple mono-synaptic connection. Since STFP induces no changes in these synapses and these synapses serve as controls for the changes we observed in M-G-M synapses (see below in Figures 1D and 1E), the precise nature of OS-M EPSCs and PG-M IPSCs is not of primary importance for the present study. We observed no STFP-induced changes in the strength of OS-M (Figure 1D), PG-M (Figure 1E), or PV-M synapses (Figure S2E) in M72-associated mitral cells in mice that were exposed to plain food or to Acp- or Oct-flavored food. However, we found that STFP with Acp-flavored food strongly potentiated reciprocal M-G-M synapses, measured by mitral cell recurrent inhibition (Isaacson and Strowbridge, 1998Isaacson J.S.

Analysis of relations between NMDA receptors and GABA release at olfactory bulb reciprocal synapses.Neuron. 2000; 25: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar; Figure 1F). As a control, we detected no changes in M-G-M synapses after STFP with Oct-flavored or plain food, and we found that recurrent inhibition of mitral cells not associated with M72 glomeruli was not potentiated by STFP with Acp-flavored food (Figures S3A–S3C). The selective strengthening of M-G-M synapses of M72-associated mitral cells was fully maintained for at least 14 days (Figure 1G), suggesting that it represented LTP. What is the nature of STFP-induced LTP at reciprocal M-G-M synapses? To address this question, we examined the effect of STFP on EPSCs in granule cells evoked by the stimulation of M72-associated mitral cells (M-G EPSCs; Figures 2A, S2I, and S2J) and on miniature EPSCs in these granule cells (mEPSCs; Figure 2B). We found no STFP-induced changes, thus excluding an enhancement of the M-G sub-synapse of reciprocal dendrodendritic M-G-M synapses as a cause of the LTP. We then recorded IPSCs from M72-associated mitral cells evoked by granule cell stimulation (G-M IPSCs). We observed that STFP significantly increased the G-M IPSC amplitude in mitral cells, but it did not change the IPSC paired-pulse ratio (Figures 2C and S2F–S2H), suggesting a postsynaptic LTP at G-M synapses. In parallel experiments, we found that LTP of G-M synapses was not induced by simply exposing M72-GFP mice to Acp-flavored food on a filter paper outside the context of STFP (Figures S3D and S3E), indicating that LTP at G-M synapses requires a social context. We also performed similar experiments with M71-GFP mice, which possess GFP+ M71 glomeruli that are also sensitive to Acp and insensitive to Oct (Bozza et al., 2002Bozza T. Feinstein P. Zheng C. Mombaerts P. Odorant receptor expression defines functional units in the mouse olfactory system.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3033-3043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that STFP training with Acp-flavored food also induced LTP in G-M synapses of M71-associated mitral cells (Figures S3F–S3H). Thus, this LTP is a general feature and not specific to a particular line of genetically manipulated mice. To further characterize the STFP-induced GABAergic LTP, we monitored in M72-associated mitral cells miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs), which are primarily mediated by G-M synapses owing to their high abundance. Strikingly, Acp-induced STFP significantly increased the mIPSC amplitude and frequency in M72-associated mitral cells (Figure 2D), suggesting that the synaptic changes during LTP were due to an increased postsynaptic GABA receptor (GABA-R) response. To test this hypothesis, we recorded inhibitory currents that were directly evoked in mitral cells by exogenously applied GABA (100 μM; Figures S2K and S2L). We detected a massive STFP-induced increase (>100%) in GABA-induced currents, confirming that STFP-induced LTP involves an increase in postsynaptic GABA-R response (Figure 2E). Together, these data suggest via multiple lines of evidence that STFP selectively causes an LTP of inhibitory responses in reciprocal M-G-M synapses of those mitral cells that are associated with glomeruli sensitive to the STFP odor. Since only the inhibitory G-M component, but not the excitatory M-G component, of the reciprocal M-G-M synapses was potentiated by STFP, we focused all subsequent experiments on G-M sub-synapses. To understand how STFP induces LTP in dendrodendritic G-M synapses, we monitored Ca2+ transients in mitral cell dendrites in vivo. We expressed GCaMP6m in mitral cells by injecting AAV-DIO-GCaMP6m into the MOB of Cdhr1-Cre mice (which express Cre-recombinase only in mitral cells; Wachowiak et al., 2013Wachowiak M. Economo M.N.

https://openalex.org/W2724336531,"Oxytetracycline (OTC) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) are two of most widely used antibiotics in livestock and poultry industry. After consumption of antibiotics, a major portion of these compounds is excreted through the feces and urine of animals. Land application of antibiotic-treated animal wastes has caused increasing concern about their adverse effects on ecosystem health. In this regard, inconsistent results have been reported regarding the effects of antibiotics on soil microbial activities. This study was conducted based on the completely randomized design to the measure microbial biomass carbon, cumulative respiration and iron (III) reduction bioassays. Concentrations of OTC and SMX including 0, 1, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg were spiked in triplicate to a sandy loam soil and incubated for 21 days at 25°C. Results showed that the effects of OTC and SMX antibiotics on cumulative respiration and microbial biomass carbon were different. SMX antibiotic significantly affected soil microbial biomass carbon and cumulative respiration at different treatments compared to control with increasing incubation time. OTC antibiotic, on the other hand, negatively affected cumulative respiration compared to control treatment throughout the incubation period. Although OTC antibiotic positively affected microbial biomass carbon at day one of incubation, there was no clear trend in microbial biomass carbon between different treatments of this antibiotic after that time period. Nevertheless, sulfamethoxazole and oxytetracycline antibiotics had similar effects on iron (III) reduction such that they considerably affected iron (III) reduction at 1 and 10 mg/kg, and iron (III) reduction was completely inhibited at concentrations above 10 mg/kg. Hence, according to our results, microbial biomass carbon and cumulative respiration experiments are not able alone to exhibit the effect of antibiotics on soil microbial activity, but combination of these two experiments with iron (III) reduction test could well display the effects of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and oxytetracycline (OTC) antibiotics on soil biochemical activities."

This model incorporates a broad range of biological features that pose challenges to neural RL, such as temporally extended action sequences, continuous environments involving unknown time delays, and noisy/imprecise computations. Most significantly, we expand the model into the realm of hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), which divides the RL process into a hierarchy of actions at different levels of abstraction. Here we implement all the major components of HRL in a neural model that captures a variety of known anatomical and physiological properties of the brain. We demonstrate the performance of the model in a range of different environments, in order to emphasize the aim of understanding the brain’s general reinforcement learning ability. These results show that the model compares well to previous modelling work and demonstrates improved performance as a result of its hierarchical ability. We also show that the model’s behaviour is consistent with available data on human hierarchical RL, and generate several novel predictions."

Meanwhile, maternity ward staff’s lack of awareness of mothers’ fears make mothers feel lonely and helpless. This study aimed to explore women’s perceptions of labor support during vaginal delivery. Materials and methods This exploratory qualitative study used qualitative content analysis to explore Iranian mothers’ experiences of labor support. Data were collected using observations and semi-structured interviews with 25 individuals. The participants were recruited through a purposive sampling method. Results Three categories, including “involvement of the spouse in the labor process”, “asking for a companion during labor”, and “mother’s self-care to cope with labor pain”, emerged during data analysis. These categories were merged to form the main theme of “trying to comply with the labor process”. Conclusion Women believed that the presence of a companion, e.g. their husband, a family member, or a doula, during labor helped them better deal with the labor process, particularly when they felt lonely. Health care providers are expected to consider the needs of mothers and try to provide holistic support for mothers during labor pain. Implications for practice It seems that some mothers adopted particular coping strategies without receiving any relevant training. It is noteworthy that although mothers may make every effort to minimize their pain, health professionals should also practice medical approaches to help them through the process of labor."

Additionally, recently developed software allow to quantify visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Currently, there are no reference values available for GE Healthcare DXA systems for VAT. The aim of this study was to develop reference values for VAT in healthy European adults aged 20–30 years using a GE Healthcare Prodigy densitometer along with the dedicated CoreScan application. We also assessed the associations of VAT with traditional cardiometabolic risk factors. In 421 participants (207 men; 214 women), we performed DXA whole-body scans and calculated total body fat (BF) and VAT (in gender-specific percentiles). We also measured blood pressure and fasting glucose, insulin, and blood lipids. Males, in comparison with females, had 2-fold greater VAT both in units of mass (542 ± 451 g; 95% CI: 479.6‒605.1 g vs. 258 ± 226 g; 95% CI: 226.9‒288.6 g) and volume (570 ± 468 cm3; 95% CI: 505.1‒635.2 cm3 vs. 273 ± 237 cm3; 95% CI: 240.6‒305.3 cm3). They also had significantly higher the VAT/BF ratio. VAT showed a stronger positive correlation than BF with blood pressure, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, glucose, insulin, and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index and a stronger negative correlation with HDL-cholesterol. Among these variables, VAT had the highest area under the curve for triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL (0.727 in males and 0.712 in females). In conclusion, we provide reference values for VAT obtained from healthy adults using the GE Healthcare DXA. These values may be useful in the diagnosis of visceral obesity, for identifying subjects with high obesity-related risks, in epidemiological studies, as a target for therapies, and in physically trained individuals. In both genders, VAT was associated with traditional cardiometabolic risk factors, particularly hypertriglyceridemia."
https://openalex.org/W2734035068,"Increasing evidence indicates that the tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in regulating the biologic behavior of breast cancer. In veterinary oncology, there is a need for improved prognostic markers to accurately identify dogs at risk for local and distant (metastatic) recurrence of mammary gland carcinoma and therefore would benefit from adjuvant therapy. Collagen density and fiber organization have been shown to regulate tumor progression in both mouse and human mammary tumors, with certain collagen signatures predicting poor outcomes in women with breast cancer. We hypothesized that collagen signatures in canine mammary tumor biopsies can serve as prognostic biomarkers and potential targets for treatment. We used second harmonic generation imaging to evaluate fibrillar collagen density, the presence of a tumor-stromal boundary, tumor associated collagen signatures (TACS) and individual collagen fiber characteristics (width, length and straightness) in grade I/II and grade III canine mammary tumors. Collagen density, as well as fiber width, length and straightness, were inversely correlated with patient overall survival time. Notably, grade III cases were less likely to have a tumor-stromal boundary and the lack of a boundary predicted poor outcome. Importantly, a lack of a defined tumor-stromal boundary and an increased collagen fiber width were associated with decreased survival even when tumor grade, patient stage, ovariohysterectomy status at the time of mammary tumor excision, and histologic evidence of lymphovascular invasion were considered in a multivariable model, indicating that these parameters could augment current methods to identify patients at high risk for local or metastatic progression/recurrence. Furthermore, these data, which identify for the first time, prognostic collagen biomarkers in naturally occurring mammary gland neoplasia in the dog, support the use of the dog as a translational model for tumor-stromal interactions in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2727689967,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are currently the first-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. These patients receive platinum-based chemotherapy as the second-line treatment after they develop resistance to TKIs. Many patients regain sensitivity to the TKIs used in the first-line treatment after the failure of chemotherapy. However, the molecular mechanism for the regain of TKI sensitivity is largely unknown. In this study, we established gefitinib-resistant PC9 and HCC827 cell lines, which did not harbor the EGFR T790M mutation and MET amplification but exhibited the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. Overexpression of EMT inducers, Snail or Slug, in the parental lines promoted their resistance to gefitinib. The gefitinib-resistant cell lines regained their sensitivity to gefitinib and displayed reverse EMT phenotypes after long-term culture in gefitinib-free culture medium. Blockage of reverse EMT by stable expression of Snail or Slug prevented the regain of TKI sensitivity. In conclusion, reverse EMT is one of the major mechanisms for the regain of TKI sensitivity in TKI-resistant NSCLC cells, suggesting that the development of small molecules targeting the EMT process may prolong the efficacy of TKIs in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations."

https://openalex.org/W2725502121,"Current photon counting x-ray detector (PCD) technology faces limitations associated with spectral fidelity and photon starvation. One strategy for addressing these limitations is to supplement PCD data with high-resolution, low-noise data acquired with an energy-integrating detector (EID). In this work, we propose an iterative, hybrid reconstruction technique which combines the spectral properties of PCD data with the resolution and signal-to-noise characteristics of EID data. Our hybrid reconstruction technique is based on an algebraic model of data fidelity which substitutes the EID data into the data fidelity term associated with the PCD reconstruction, resulting in a joint reconstruction problem. Within the split Bregman framework, these data fidelity constraints are minimized subject to additional constraints on spectral rank and on joint intensity-gradient sparsity measured between the reconstructions of the EID and PCD data. Following a derivation of the proposed technique, we apply it to the reconstruction of a digital phantom which contains realistic concentrations of iodine, barium, and calcium encountered in small-animal micro-CT. The results of this experiment suggest reliable separation and detection of iodine at concentrations ≥ 5 mg/ml and barium at concentrations ≥ 10 mg/ml in 2-mm features for EID and PCD data reconstructed with inherent spatial resolutions of 176 μm and 254 μm, respectively (point spread function, FWHM). Furthermore, hybrid reconstruction is demonstrated to enhance spatial resolution within material decomposition results and to improve low-contrast detectability by as much as 2.6 times relative to reconstruction with PCD data only. The parameters of the simulation experiment are based on an in vivo micro-CT experiment conducted in a mouse model of soft-tissue sarcoma. Material decomposition results produced from this in vivo data demonstrate the feasibility of distinguishing two K-edge contrast agents with a spectral separation on the order of the energy resolution of the PCD hardware."
https://openalex.org/W2733444684,"Shallow marine ecosystems naturally experience fluctuating physicochemical conditions across spatial and temporal scales. Widespread coral-bleaching events, induced by prolonged heat stress, highlight the importance of how the duration and frequency of thermal stress influence the adaptive physiology of photosymbiotic calcifiers. Large benthic foraminifera harboring algal endosymbionts are major tropical carbonate producers and bioindicators of ecosystem health. Like corals, they are sensitive to thermal stress and bleach at temperatures temporarily occurring in their natural habitat and projected to happen more frequently. However, their thermal tolerance has been studied so far only by chronic exposure, so how they respond under more realistic episodic heat-event scenarios remains unknown. Here, we determined the physiological responses of Amphistegina gibbosa, an abundant western Atlantic foraminifera, to four different treatments--control, single, episodic, and chronic exposure to the same thermal stress (32°C)--in controlled laboratory cultures. Exposure to chronic thermal stress reduced motility and growth, while antioxidant capacity was elevated, and photosymbiont variables (coloration, oxygen-production rates, chlorophyll a concentration) indicated extensive bleaching. In contrast, single- and episodic-stress treatments were associated with higher motility and growth, while photosymbiont variables remained stable. The effects of single and episodic heat events were similar, except for the presumable occurrence of reproduction, which seemed to be suppressed by both episodic and chronic stress. The otherwise different responses between treatments with thermal fluctuations and chronic stress indicate adaptation to thermal peaks, but not to chronic exposure expected to ensue when baseline temperatures are elevated by climate change. This firstly implies that marine habitats with a history of fluctuating thermal stress potentially support resilient physiological mechanisms among photosymbiotic organisms. Secondly, there seem to be temporal constraints related to heat events among coral reef environments and reinforces the importance of temporal fluctuations in stress exposure in global-change studies and projections."

We investigated the efficacy of the composite autonomic symptom scale 31 (COMPASS 31) questionnaire as a tool for evaluating autonomic function in parkinsonism patients. In this study, we enrolled drug-naïve patients with MSA-P and PD, and administered the COMPASS-31 and an objective autonomic dysfunction test (AFT). Demographic and clinical data, including parkinsonism and autonomic dysfunction, were compared between the two groups. Additionally, we determined the optimal COMPASS 31 cut-off score to differentiate MSA-P from PD for use as a screening tool. In this study, 27 MSA-P patients and 41 PD patients were recruited. The total COMPASS 31 score was well correlated with the objective AFT results. When we compared the COMPASS 31 score between the two groups, MSA-P patients showed higher total scores and sub-scores in the orthostatic intolerance, gastrointestinal, and bladder domains compared with PD patients. Similarly, MSA-P patients had more abnormalities in expiration to inspiration ratio, Valsalva ratio and pressure recovery time than PD patients in objective AFT. With 13.25 as the cut-off score for diagnosis of MSA-P, the total COMPASS-31 score demonstrated high sensitivity (92.6%) and moderate specificity (51.2%) with an area under the curve of 0.765. Based on our results, the COMPASS 31 is an effective tool for evaluation of autonomic function in patients with parkinsonism. The COMPASS-31 could be used as a sensitive and convenient screening tool, especially for the differentiation between MSA-P and PD."

Brachypodium distachyon, recently developed an excellent model organism for functional genomics research, is related to the major cereal grain species. Although B. distachyon genome has been fully sequenced, the information of Hsf and Hsp70 genes and especially the regulatory network between Hsfs and Hsp70s remains incomplete. Here, a total of 24 BdHsfs and 29 BdHsp70s were identified in the genome by bioinformatics analysis and the regulatory network between Hsfs and Hsp70s were performed in this study. Based on highly conserved domain and motif analysis, BdHsfs were grouped into three classes, and BdHsp70s divided into six groups, respectively. Most of Hsf proteins contain five conserved domains: DBD, HR-A/B region, NLS and NES motifs and AHA domain, while Hsp70 proteins have three conserved domains: N-terminal nucleotide binding domain, peptide binding domain and a variable C-terminal lid region. Expression data revealed a large number of BdHsfs and BdHsp70s were induced by HS challenge, and a previous heat acclimation could induce the acquired thermotolerance to help seedling suffer the severe HS challenge, suggesting that the BdHsfs and BdHsp70s played a role in alleviating the damage by HS. The comparison revealed that, most BdHsfs and BdHsp70s genes responded to multiple abiotic stresses in an overlapping relationship, while some of them were stress specific response genes. Moreover, co-expression relationships and predicted protein-protein interaction network implied that class A and B Hsfs played as activator and repressors, respectively, suggesting that BdHsp70s might be regulated by both the activation and the repression mechanisms under stress condition. Our genomics analysis of BdHsfs and BdHsp70s provides important evolutionary and functional characterization for further investigation of the accurate regulatory mechanisms among Hsfs and Hsp70s in herbaceous plants."
https://openalex.org/W2732066290,"The multidimensional nature of dengue virus (DENV) infections, which can be caused by four distinct serotypes of the virus, complicates the sensitivity of assays designed for the diagnosis of infection. Different viral markers can be optimally detected at different stages of infection. Of particular clinical importance is the early identification of infection, which is pivotal for disease management and the development of blood screening assays. Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is an early surrogate marker of infection and its detection in serum coincides with detectable viraemia. The aim of this work was to isolate and characterise serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies that bind to NS1 for each of the four DENV serotypes. This was achieved using phage display and a subtractive biopanning strategy to direct the antibody selection towards serotype-specific epitopes. This antibody isolation strategy has advantages over immunisation techniques where it is difficult to avoid antibody responses to cross-reactive, immunodominant epitopes. Serotype specificity to recombinant antigen for each of the antibodies was confirmed by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Surface Plasmon Resonance. Confirmation of binding to native DENV NS1 was achieved using ELISA and immunofluorescence assay on DENV infected Vero cells. No cross-reactivity with Zika or Kunjin viruses was observed. A previously isolated pan-reactive antibody that binds to an immunodominant epitope was able to pair with each of the serotype-specific antibodies in a sandwich ELISA, indicating that the serotype specific antibodies bind to epitopes which are all spatially distinct from the immunodominant epitope. These antibodies were suitable for use in a multiplexed assay for simultaneous detection and serotyping of DENV NS1 in human serum. This work demonstrates that phage display coupled with novel biopanning strategies is a valuable in vitro methodology for isolation of binders that can discern amongst antigens with high homology for diagnostic applicability."
https://openalex.org/W2732778111,"ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5), a member of the bZIP gene family, is a positive regulator of the light signaling pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. Whereas the hy5 mutant exhibits an elongated hypocotyl when grown in the light, the hy5 homolog (hyh) mutant does not. Although the functions of HY5 and HYH in light-mediated seedling development have been revealed, the tissue-specific expression patterns of HY5 and HYH and their interconnected regulation are largely unknown. Here, we report that HY5 regulates HYH expression in roots and contributes to root growth under different light conditions. We generated HY5 and HYH transcriptional and translational fusion reporter lines to investigate their expression patterns. HY5 was constitutively expressed in all root tissues, while HYH was predominantly expressed in root xylem cells. Root growth after a dark-to-light transition was perturbed in the hy5 and hy5hyh mutant lines, but not in the hyh mutant line, indicating that HY5 plays a major role in light-regulated root growth. Light-induced HY5/HYH expression occurred autonomously in roots. HYH expression in roots was decreased in the hy5 mutant, suggesting that HY5 regulates HYH expression. Collectively, these results indicate that an organ-specific HY5-mediated pathway controls root photomorphogenic development independently of light signaling in the shoot."
https://openalex.org/W2732849779,"This study considers the effect of an industry's network topology on its systemic risk contribution to the stock market using data from the CSI 300 two-tier industry indices from the Chinese stock market. We first measure industry's conditional-value-at-risk (CoVaR) and the systemic risk contribution (ΔCoVaR) using the fitted time-varying t-copula function. The network of the stock industry is established based on dynamic conditional correlations with the minimum spanning tree. Then, we investigate the connection characteristics and topology of the network. Finally, we utilize seemingly unrelated regression estimation (SUR) of panel data to analyze the relationship between network topology of the stock industry and the industry's systemic risk contribution. The results show that the systemic risk contribution of small-scale industries such as real estate, food and beverage, software services, and durable goods and clothing, is higher than that of large-scale industries, such as banking, insurance and energy. Industries with large betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and clustering coefficient and small node occupancy layer are associated with greater systemic risk contribution. In addition, further analysis using a threshold model confirms that the results are robust."

A genome-wide association study revealed a significant association on bovine chromosome 7 at positions 6,166,179 and 12,429,691. Whole genome re-sequencing of one case and four relatives showed a nonsense mutation (g.5995966C>T) in the PZP-like, alpha-2-macroglobulin domain containing 8 (CPAMD8) gene leading to a premature stop codon (CPAMD8 p.Gln74*) associated with cataract development in cattle. With immunohistochemistry we confirmed a physiological expression of CPAMD8 in the ciliary body epithelium of the eye in unaffected cattle, while the protein was not detectable in the ciliary body of cattle with cataracts. RNA expression of CPAMD8 was detected in healthy adult, fetal and cataractous lenses."

It is therefore important to understand the convergent validity of parent-report tools in comparison to direct assessments of language and attention. In particular, cultural and linguistic background may influence this convergence. In this study a group of six- to eight-year old children (N = 110) completed direct assessments of language and attention and their parents reported on the same areas. Convergence between assessment types was explored using correlations. Possible influences of ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic) and of parent report language (English or Spanish) were explored using hierarchical linear regression. Correlations between parent report and direct child assessments were significant for both language and attention, suggesting convergence between assessment types. Ethnicity and parent report language did not moderate the relationships between direct child assessments and parent report tools for either attention or language."
https://openalex.org/W2727490504,"Objective The purpose of our study was to assess the differentially diagnostic value of radiographic characteristics of pure ground glass nodules (GGNs) between minimally invasive adenocarcinoma and non-invasive neoplasm. Methods Sixty-seven pure GGNs (28 minimally invasive adenocarcinomas (MIA) and 39 pre-invasive lesions) were analyzed from June 2012 to June 2015. Pre-invasive lesions consisted of 15 atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) and 24 adenocarcinomas in situ (AIS). High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) features and volume of MIA and pre-invasive lesions were assessed. Fisher exact test, independent sample t test, Mann-Whitney U test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed. Results Inter-observer agreement indexes for the diameter, mean HRCT attenuations and volume of pure GGNs were all high (ICC>0.75). Univariate analyses showed that lesion diameter, mean HRCT attenuation, and volume value differed significantly between two groups. Among HRCT findings, GGN shape as round or oval (F = 13.456, P = 0.002) and lesion borders as smooth or notched (F = 15.742, P = 0.001) frequently appeared in pre-invasive lesions in comparison with MIA. Type II and type III of the relationship between blood vessels and pure GGNs suggested higher possibility of malignancy than type I. Conclusions HRCT features of pure GGNs can help to differentiate MIA from non-invasive neoplasms."
https://openalex.org/W2733079183,"Several regulators of programmed cell death (PCD) have been identified in plants which encode proteins with putative lipid-binding domains. Among them, VAD1 (Vascular Associated Death) contains a novel protein domain called VASt (VAD1 analog StAR-related lipid transfer) still uncharacterized. The Arabidopsis mutant vad1-1 has been shown to exhibit a lesion mimic phenotype with light-conditional appearance of propagative hypersensitive response-like lesions along the vascular system, associated with defense gene expression and increased resistance to Pseudomonas strains. To test the potential of ectopic expression of VAD1 to influence HR cell death and to elucidate the role of the VASt domain in this function, we performed a structure-function analysis of VAD1 by transient over-expression in Nicotiana benthamiana and by complementation of the mutant vad1-1. We found that (i) overexpression of VAD1 controls negatively the HR cell death and defense expression either transiently in Nicotiana benthamania or in Arabidopsis plants in response to avirulent strains of Pseudomonas syringae, (ii) VAD1 is expressed in multiple subcellular compartments, including the nucleus, and (iii) while the GRAM domain does not modify neither the subcellular localization of VAD1 nor its immunorepressor activity, the domain VASt plays an essential role in both processes. In conclusion, VAD1 acts as a negative regulator of cell death associated with the plant immune response and the VASt domain of this unknown protein plays an essential role in this function, opening the way for the functional analysis of VASt-containing proteins and the characterization of novel mechanisms regulating PCD."

Animals are affected directly by the transmitted pathogens and indirectly when animal movement is restricted. Distribution of such diseases depends on climatic and social factors, namely, environmental changes, globalization, trade and unplanned urbanization. Culicoides biting midges are responsible for the transmission of several pathogenic agents with relevant economic impact. Due to a fragmentary knowledge of their ecology, occurrence is difficult to predict consequently, limiting the control of these arthropod vectors. In order to understand the distribution of Culicoides species, in mainland Portugal, data collected during the National Entomologic Surveillance Program for Bluetongue disease (2005-2013), were used for statistical evaluation. Logistic regression analysis was preformed and prediction maps (per season) were obtained for vector and potentially vector species. The variables used at the present study were selected from WorldClim (two climatic variables) and CORINE databases (twenty-two land cover variables). This work points to an opposite distribution of C. imicola and species from the Obsoletus group within mainland Portugal. Such findings are evidenced in autumn, with the former appearing in Central and Southern regions. Although appearing northwards, on summer and autumn, C. newsteadi reveals a similar distribution to C. imicola. The species C. punctatus appears in all Portuguese territory throughout the year. Contrary, C. pulicaris is poorly caught in all areas of mainland Portugal, being paradoxical present near coastal areas and higher altitude regions."

The pathways and prognostic factors for receiving these benefits seen in recent years are complex and manifold. We postulate that mental health and IQ, both alone and concurrent, influence subsequent employment status, disability benefits and mortality.A cohort of 918 888 Norwegian men was followed for 16 years from the age of 20 to 55. Risk for health benefits, emigration, and mortality were studied. Indicators of mental health and IQ at military enrolment were used as potential risk factors. Multi-state models were used to analyze transitions between employment, sick leave, time limited benefits, disability benefits, emigration, and mortality.During follow up, there were a total of 3 908 397 transitions between employment and different health benefits, plus 12 607 deaths. Men with low IQ (below 85), without any mental health problems at military enrolment, had an increased probability of receiving disability benefits before the age of 35 (HRR = 4.06, 95% CI: 3.88-4.26) compared to men with average IQ (85 to 115) and no mental health problems. For men with both low IQ and mental health problems, there was an excessive probability of receiving disability benefits before the age of 35 (HRR = 14.37, 95% CI: 13.59-15.19), as well as an increased probability for time limited benefits and death before the age of 35 compared to men with average IQ (85 to 115) and no mental health problems.Low IQ and mental health problems are strong predictors of future disability benefits and early mortality for young men."
https://openalex.org/W2727442874,"Integrate-and-fire (IF) models can provide close matches to the discharge activity of neurons, but do they oversimplify the biophysical properties of the neurons? A single compartment Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model of the oxytocin neuron has previously been developed, incorporating biophysical measurements of channel properties obtained in vitro. A simpler modified integrate-and-fire model has also been developed, which can match well the characteristic spike patterning of oxytocin neurons as observed in vivo. Here, we extended the HH model to incorporate synaptic input, to enable us to compare spike activity in the model with experimental data obtained in vivo. We refined the HH model parameters to closely match the data, and then matched the same experimental data with a modified IF model, using an evolutionary algorithm to optimise parameter matching. Finally we compared the properties of the modified HH model with those of the IF model to seek an explanation for differences between spike patterning in vitro and in vivo. We show that, with slight modifications, the original HH model, like the IF model, is able to closely match both the interspike interval (ISI) distributions of oxytocin neurons and the observed variability of spike firing rates in vivo and in vitro. This close match of both models to data depends on the presence of a slow activity-dependent hyperpolarisation (AHP); this is represented in both models and the parameters used in the HH model representation match well with optimal parameters of the IF model found by an evolutionary algorithm. The ability of both models to fit data closely also depends on a shorter hyperpolarising after potential (HAP); this is explicitly represented in the IF model, but in the HH model, it emerges from a combination of several components. The critical elements of this combination are identified."
https://openalex.org/W2728592019,"Our objective was to study the frequency of circulating CD19+CD24hiCD38hi B cells (Breg) in AS patients. To this end, peripheral blood was drawn from AS patients naïve for TNF blockers (AS/nb) (n = 42) and healthy controls (HC) (n = 42). Six patients donated blood for a second time, 6 months after initiating treatment with anti-TNFα drugs. After isolation by Ficoll-Hypaque, PBMCs were stained with antibodies to CD3, CD4, CD19, CD24, and CD38, and examined by cytometry. For functional studies, total CD19+ B cells were isolated from PBMCs of 3 HC by magnetical sorting. Breg-depleted CD19+ B cells were obtained after CD19+CD24hiCD38hi B cells were removed from total CD19+ cells by cytometry. Total CD19+ B cells or Breg-depleted CD19+ B cells were established in culture and stimulated through their BCR. Secretion of IFNγ was determined by ELISA in culture supernatants. When compared with HC, AS/nb patients demonstrated a significantly increased frequency of Breg cells, which was independent of disease activity. Anti-TNFα drugs induced a significant reduction of circulating Breg numbers, which were no longer elevated after six months of treatment. Functional in vitro studies showed that the secretion of IFNγ was significantly higher in Breg-depleted as compared with total CD19+ B cells, indicating that Breg can downmodulate B cell pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. In summary, an increased frequency of circulating CD19+CD24hiCD38hi B cells is observed in AS/nb patients, that is not related with disease activity; anti-TNFα drugs are able to downmodulate circulating Breg numbers in AS."
https://openalex.org/W2731278704,"Social relationships are crucially dependent on individual ability to learn and remember ecologically relevant cues. However, the way animals recognize cues before engaging in any social interaction and how their response is regulated by brain neuromodulators remains unclear. We examined the putative involvement of arginine vasotocin (AVT) and isotocin (IT), acting at different brain regions, during fish decision-making in the context of cooperation, by trying to identify how fish distinguish and recognize the value of other social partners or species. We hypothesized that the behavioural responses of cleaner fish clients to different social contexts would be underlain by changes in brain AVT and IT levels. We have found that changes in AVT at the level of forebrain and optic tectum are linked with a response to allopatric cleaners (novel or unfamiliar stimuli) while those at cerebellum are associated with the willingness to be cleaned (in response to sympatric cleaners). On the other hand, higher brain IT levels that were solely found in the diencephalon, also in response to allopatric cleaners. Our results are the first to implicate these nonapeptides, AVT in particular, in the assessment of social cues which enable fish to engage in mutualistic activities."
https://openalex.org/W2962992844,"Local Ca2+ Releases (LCRs) are crucial events involved in cardiac pacemaker cell function. However, specific algorithms for automatic LCR detection and analysis have not been developed in live, spontaneously beating pacemaker cells. In the present study we measured LCRs using a high-speed 2D-camera in spontaneously contracting sinoatrial (SA) node cells isolated from rabbit and guinea pig and developed a new algorithm capable of detecting and analyzing the LCRs spatially in two-dimensions, and in time. Our algorithm tracks points along the midline of the contracting cell. It uses these points as a coordinate system for affine transform, producing a transformed image series where the cell does not contract. Action potential-induced Ca2+ transients and LCRs were thereafter isolated from recording noise by applying a series of spatial filters. The LCR birth and death events were detected by a differential (frame-to-frame) sensitivity algorithm applied to each pixel (cell location). An LCR was detected when its signal changes sufficiently quickly within a sufficiently large area. The LCR is considered to have died when its amplitude decays substantially, or when it merges into the rising whole cell Ca2+ transient. Ultimately, our algorithm provides major LCR parameters such as period, signal mass, duration, and propagation path area. As the LCRs propagate within live cells, the algorithm identifies splitting and merging behaviors, indicating the importance of locally propagating Ca2+-induced-Ca2+-release for the fate of LCRs and for generating a powerful ensemble Ca2+ signal. Thus, our new computer algorithms eliminate motion artifacts and detect 2D local spatiotemporal events from recording noise and global signals. While the algorithms were developed to detect LCRs in sinoatrial nodal cells, they have the potential to be used in other applications in biophysics and cell physiology, for example, to detect Ca2+ wavelets (abortive waves), sparks and embers in muscle cells and Ca2+ puffs and syntillas in neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2729316809,"Bacteria can rarely be isolated from normal healthy lungs using conventional culture techniques, supporting the traditional belief that the lungs are sterile. Yet recent studies using next generation sequencing report that bacterial DNA commonly found in the upper respiratory tract (URT) is present at lower levels in the lungs. Interpretation of that finding is complicated by the technical limitations and potential for contamination introduced when dealing with low biomass samples. The current work sought to overcome those limitations to clarify the number, type and source of bacteria present in the lungs of normal mice. Results showed that the oral microbiome is diverse and highly conserved whereas murine lung samples fall into three distinct patterns. 33% of the samples were sterile, as they lacked culturable bacteria and their bacterial DNA content did not differ from background. 9% of samples contained comparatively higher amounts of bacterial DNA whose composition mimicked that detected in the URT. A final group (58%) contained smaller amounts of microbial DNA whose composition was correlating to that of rodent chow and cage bedding, likely acquired by inspiration of food and bedding fragments. By analyzing each sample independently rather than working with group averages, this work eliminated the bias introduced by aspiration-contaminated samples to establish that three distinct microbiome pneumotypes are present in normal murine lungs."
https://openalex.org/W2731233152,"Arrogant behavior is as old as human nature. Nonetheless, the factors that cause people to be perceived as arrogant have received very little research attention. In this paper, we focused on a typical manifestation of arrogance: dismissive behavior. In particular, we explored the conditions under which a person who dismissed advice would be perceived as arrogant. We examined two factors: the advisee’s competence, and the manner in which he or she dismissed the advice. The effect of the advisee’s competence was tested by manipulating two competence cues: relative expertise, and the outcome of the advice dismissal (i.e., whether the advisee was right or wrong). In six studies (N = 1304), participants made arrogance judgments about protagonists who dismissed the advice of another person while the advisees’ relative expertise (compared to the advisor), their eventual correctness, and the manner of their dismissal were manipulated in between-participant designs. Across various types of decisions and advisee-advisor relationships, the results show that less expert, less correct, and ruder advisees are perceived as more arrogant. We also find that outcome trumps expertise, and manner trumps both expertise and outcomes. In two additional studies (N = 101), we examined people’s naïve theories about the relative importance of the aforementioned arrogance cues. These studies showed that people overestimate the role of expertise information as compared to the role of interpersonal manner and outcomes. Thus, our results suggest that people may commit arrogant faux pas because they erroneously expect that their expertise will justify their dismissive behavior."

UMCC 2581 is a Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine strain with enhanced GSH content at the end of wine fermentation. This strain was previously derived by selection for molybdate resistance following a sexual cycle of UMCC 855 using an evolution-based strategy. In this study, we examined genetic and gene expression changes associated with the derivation of UMCC 2581. For genetic analysis we sporulated the diploid UMCC 855 parental strain and found four phenotype classes of segregants related to molybdate resistance, demonstrating the presence of segregating variation from the parental strain. Using bulk segregant analysis we mapped molybdate traits to two loci. By sequencing both the parental and evolved strain genomes we identified candidate mutations within the two regions as well as an extra copy of chromosome 1 in UMCC 2581. Combining the mapped loci with gene expression profiles of the evolved and parental strains we identified a number of candidate genes with genetic and/or gene expression changes that could underlie molybdate resistance and increased GSH levels. Our results provide insight into the genetic basis of GSH production relevant to winemaking and highlight the value of enhancing wine strains using existing variation present in wine strains."
https://openalex.org/W2732603270,"A eukaryotic cell contains multiple membrane-bound compartments. Transport vesicles move cargo between these compartments, just as trucks move cargo between warehouses. These processes are regulated by specific molecular interactions, as summarized in the Rothman-Schekman-Sudhof model of vesicle traffic. The whole structure can be represented as a transport graph: each organelle is a node, and each vesicle route is a directed edge. What constraints must such a graph satisfy, if it is to represent a biologically realizable vesicle traffic network? Graph connectedness is an informative feature: 2-connectedness is necessary and sufficient for mass balance, but stronger conditions are required to ensure correct molecular specificity. Here we use Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and model checking as a framework to discover and verify graph constraints. The poor scalability of SAT model checkers often prevents their broad application. By exploiting the special structure of the problem, we scale our model checker to vesicle traffic systems with reasonably large numbers of molecules and compartments. This allows us to test a range of hypotheses about graph connectivity, which can later be proved in full generality by other methods."

We previously showed that ex vivo CMV restimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of CMV-seropositive volunteers expanded CD4+CD27-CD28- regulatory T cells (Tregs). Here we evaluate the phenotype and function of circulating CD4+CD27-CD28- T cells of CMV-seropositive adults. Compared with CMV-seronegative, CMV-seropositive adults had 10-fold higher CD4+CD27-CD28-% T cells in PBMC. Circulating CD4+CD27-CD28- T cells from both CMV-seropositive and seronegative donors expressed higher levels of TGFβ, granzyme B, CD39, CD147 and IL-35, and lower levels of CD127, compared with their parent circulating CD4+ T cells. However, only CMV-seropositive circulating CD4+CD27-CD28- had increased FOXP3 expression. CD4+CD27-CD28- sorted from the PBMC of CMV-seropositive donors expanded ex vivo in the presence of rhIL2 and inhibited ex vivo proliferation of autologous PBMC restimulated with CMV, varicella-zoster virus or C. albicans antigens. CD4+CD27-CD28- sorted from CMV-seronegative PBMC did not expand in the presence of rhIL2 and did not inhibit autologous PBMC proliferation. CD3+CD27-CD28- circulating T cells (≥80% CD8+) from CMV-seropositive HIV-infected donors also inhibited ex vivo proliferation of autologous PBMC restimulated with CMV or HIV. These data indicate that CMV-seropositive individuals have circulating Tregs that inhibit cell-mediated immune responses to CMV and other antigens and may be contribute to an immune-suppressive effect of CMV infection. Moreover, the phenotypic similarity between circulating CD4+CD27-CD28- Tregs with differentiated effector T cells suggests that the two T-cell subsets might evolve in parallel or in sequence from the same progenitor cells in response to CMV stimulation during reactivations."
https://openalex.org/W2727361012,"Background Recent studies have reported prognosis differences between male and female heart failure patients following cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). However, the potential clinical factors that underpin these differences remain to be elucidated. Methods A meta-analysis was performed to investigate the factors that characterize sex-specific differences following CRT. This analysis involved searching the Medline (Pubmed source) and Embase databases in the period from January 1980 to September 2016. Results Fifty-eight studies involving 33445 patients (23.08% of whom were women) were analyzed as part of this study. Only patients receiving CRT with follow-up greater than six months were included in our analysis. Compared with males, females exhibited a reduction of 33% (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.62–0.73; P < 0.0001) and 42% (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.46–0.74; P = 0.003) in all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization or heart failure, respectively. Following a stratified analysis of all-cause mortality, we observed that ischemic causes (p = 0.03) were likely to account for most of the sex-specific differences in relation to CRT. Conclusion These data suggest that women have a reduced risk of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization or heart failure following CRT. Based on the results from the stratified analysis, we observed more optimal outcomes for females with ischemic heart disease. Thus, ischemia are likely to play a role in sex-related differences associated with CRT in heart failure patients. Further studies are required to determine other indications and the potential mechanisms that might be associated with sex-specific CRT outcomes."

Many mutations in the FAM83H gene have been identified to result in autosomal dominant hypocalcified amelogenesis imperfecta in different populations. However, the structure and function of FAM83H and its pathological mechanism have yet to be further explored. Evolutionary analysis is an alternative for revealing residues or motifs that are important for protein function. In the present study, we chose 50 vertebrate species in public databases representative of approximately 230 million years of evolution, including 1 amphibian, 2 fishes, 7 sauropsidas and 40 mammals, and we performed evolutionary analysis on the FAM83H protein. By sequence alignment, conserved residues and motifs were indicated, and the loss of important residues and motifs of five special species (Malayan pangolin, platypus, minke whale, nine-banded armadillo and aardvark) was discovered. A phylogenetic time tree showed the FAM83H divergent process. Positive selection sites in the C-terminus suggested that the C-terminus of FAM83H played certain adaptive roles during evolution. The results confirmed some important motifs reported in previous findings and identified some new highly conserved residues and motifs that need further investigation. The results suggest that the C-terminus of FAM83H contain key conserved regions critical to enamel formation and calcification."

Here, we detected a total of 11 Glu-A1 locus haplotypes (H1 to H11) in three wheat species, by developing and using a new set of DNA markers (Xrj5, Xid3, Xrj6, Xid4 and Xrj7). The main haplotypes found in the diploid wheat T. urartu were H1, H4, H5 and H6, with H1 and H4 expressing both 1Ax and 1Ay subunits. The major haplotypes revealed for tetraploid wheat (T. turgidum) were H1, H8 and H9, with the lines expressing both 1Ax and 1Ay belonging to H1, H4 or H7. Four major haplotypes (H1, H9, H10 and H11) were discovered in common wheat, with Glu-A1a associated with H1 and H8, Glu-A1b with H10 or H11, and Glu-A1c with H9. The Glu-A1 locus haplotypes and the new set of DNA markers have potential to be used for more effectively studying and utilizing the molecular variations of Glu-A1 to improve the end-use quality of common wheat are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2725967831,"The Soviet Union played the leading role in fish introductions in Eurasia. However, only 3% of all introductions prior to 1978 gave a commercial benefit. One of the noteworthy examples appears to be the Sevan trout (Salmo ischchan Kessler, 1877)-an endemic salmonid of Lake Sevan in Armenia. This species has been introduced to Kirghizstan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, however, only the Kirghiz population has persisted in relatively high numbers. In this paper we provide the first extensive molecular study of S. ischchan using samples from the native population from Lake Sevan and three hatcheries in Armenia, as well as from the population introduced to Lake Issyk Kul in Kirghizstan. The Kirghiz population has been isolated since the introductions took place in 1930 and 1936. Our results, based on 11 nuclear microsatellites and a 905 bp fragment of the mitochondrial control region suggest that hatcheries have maintained genetic variability by way of ongoing translocations of individuals from Lake Sevan. Simultaneously, significant Garza-Williamson M-values suggest that bottlenecks could have reduced the genetic variability of the wild populations in the past. This hypothesis is supported by historical data, indicating highly manipulated water-level regulations and poaching as two main factors that dramatically impact fish abundance in the lake. On the other hand, a similar situation has been observed in Kirghizstan, but this population likely rebounded from small population size faster than the other populations examined. The Kirghiz population is significantly genetically differentiated from the other groups and have morphological features and biological attributes not observed in the source population. Genetic data imply that the effective population size in the native population is lower than that found in the introduced population, suggesting that some active protection of the Lake Sevan population may be needed urgently."

The structural impact of the residues flanking Arginine cleavage sites was studied by in silico analysis through comparing the cleavage cleft of the native site with a hypothetically optimized sequence at each site. Moreover, recombinant FVIII proteins were prepared by replacing the sequences flanking native thrombin cleavage sites with the proposed cleavage-optimized sequence. FVIII specific activity was determined by assessing the FVIII activity levels in relation to FVIII antigen levels. We further investigated whether thrombin generation could reflect the haemostatic potential of the variants. Our in silico results show the impact of the residues directly in the cleavage bond, and their neighboring residues on the insertion efficiency of the loop into the thrombin cleavage cleft. Moreover, the in vitro analysis shows that the sequences flanking the Arg1708 cleavage site seem to be the most close to optimal residues for achieving the maximal proteolytic activation and profactor activity of FVIII. The residues flanking the scissile bonds of FVIIII affect the cleavage rates and modulate the profactor activation. We were able to provide insights into the mechanisms of the specificity of thrombin for the P1 cleavage sites of FVIII. Thus, the P4-P2´ residues surrounding Arg1708 of FVIII have the highest impact on rates of thrombin proteolysis which contributes to thrombin activation of the profactor and eventually to the thrombin generation potential."

The laboratory and in-clinic performance of a BGM system before and after disinfection should be demonstrated to guarantee accurate readings and reliable control of blood glucose (BG) for patients. In this study, an effective disinfection procedure, conducting wiping 10 times to assure a one minute contact time of the disinfectant on contaminated surface, was first demonstrated using test samples of the meter housing materials, including acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and polycarbonate (PC), in accordance with ISO 15197:2013. After bench studies comprising 10,000 disinfection cycles, the elemental compositions of the disinfected ABS, PMMA, and PC samples were almost the same as in the original samples, as indicated by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis. Subsequently, the validated disinfection procedure was then directly applied to disinfect 5 commercial BGM systems composed of ABS, PMMA, or PC to observe the effect of the validated disinfection procedure on meter accuracy. The results of HBsAg values after treatment with HBV sera and disinfectant wipes for each material were less than the LoD of each material of 0.020 IU/mL. Before and after the multiple disinfection cycles, 900 of 900 samples (100%) were within the system accuracy requirements of ISO 15197:2013. All of the systems showed high performance before and after the series of disinfection cycles and met the ISO 15197:2013 requirements. In addition, our results demonstrated multiple cleaning and disinfection cycles that represented normal use over the lifetime of a meter of 3-5 years. Our validated cleaning and disinfection procedure can be directly applied to other registered disinfectants for cleaning commercial BGM products in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2727763134,"Difficulty regulating positive mood and energy is a feature that cuts across different pediatric psychiatric disorders. Yet, little is known regarding the neural mechanisms underlying different developmental trajectories of positive mood and energy regulation in youth. Recent studies indicate that machine learning techniques can help elucidate the role of neuroimaging measures in classifying individual subjects by specific symptom trajectory. Cortical thickness measures were extracted in sixty-eight anatomical regions covering the entire brain in 115 participants from the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic Symptoms (LAMS) study and 31 healthy comparison youth (12.5 y/o;-Male/Female = 15/16;-IQ = 104;-Right/Left handedness = 24/5). Using a combination of trajectories analyses, surface reconstruction, and machine learning techniques, the present study aims to identify the extent to which measures of cortical thickness can accurately distinguish youth with higher (n = 18) from those with lower (n = 34) trajectories of manic-like behaviors in a large sample of LAMS youth (n = 115; 13.6 y/o; M/F = 68/47, IQ = 100.1, R/L = 108/7). Machine learning analyses revealed that widespread cortical thickening in portions of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, right inferior and middle temporal gyrus, bilateral precuneus, and bilateral paracentral gyri and cortical thinning in portions of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and right parahippocampal gyrus accurately differentiate (Area Under Curve = 0.89;p = 0.03) youth with different (higher vs lower) trajectories of positive mood and energy dysregulation over a period up to 5years, as measured by the Parent General Behavior Inventory-10 Item Mania Scale. Our findings suggest that specific patterns of cortical thickness may reflect transdiagnostic neural mechanisms associated with different temporal trajectories of positive mood and energy dysregulation in youth. This approach has potential to identify patterns of neural markers of future clinical course."
https://openalex.org/W2732999591,"Most real-world judgments and decisions require the consideration of multiple types of evidence. For example, judging the severity of environmental damage, medical illness, or negative economic trends often involves tracking and integrating evidence from multiple sources (i.e. different natural disasters, physical symptoms, or financial indicators). We hypothesized that the requirement to track and integrate across distinct types of evidence would affect severity judgments of multifaceted problems, compared to simpler problems. To test this, we used scenarios depicting crop damage. Each scenario involved either two event types (i.e. mold damage and insect damage), or one event type. Participants judged the quality of the crop following each scenario. In Experiments 1 and 2, subjective judgments were attenuated if the scenario depicted multiple event types, relative to scenarios depicting single event types. This was evident as a shallower slope of subjective severity ratings, as a function of objectively quantifiable severity, for scenarios with multiple event types. In Experiment 3, we asked whether alternation between event types might contribute to this attenuation. Each scenario contained two event types, and the sequence of events either alternated frequently between types or was organized into two sequential groups. Subjective judgments were attenuated for scenarios with frequently alternating sequences. The results demonstrate that alternation between distinct event types attenuates subjective judgments of severity. This suggests that a requirement to integrate evidence across multiple sources places extra demands on the cognitive system, which reduces the perceived evidence strength."
