https://openalex.org/W2014347361,"Abstract Individual segments of the chromosomal DNA in D. melanogaster were isolated, and the sequences they contain were analyzed for repetition and mapped within the polytene chromosomes. Isolation was achieved by first constructing circular hybrid DNA molecules consisting of single chromosomal segments linked by poly(dA):poly(dT) joints to single molecules of the tetracycline resistance plasmid, pSC101. Tetracycline-sensitive E. coli were transformed to resistance by this heterogeneous population of hybrid molecules and homogeneous populations of different hybrids were isolated from the clones of transformants. Three hybrid plasmids (pDm 1, 2, and 4) were studied in detail. Each exhibits the structure expected from the method of construction and none exhibits internal sequence repetition detectable by reassociation kinetics. The D. melanogaster sequences in pDm2 and 4 belong to a single class defined by little or no repetition within the genome and localization to a single chromomeric region in the polytene chromosomes. The characteristics of this class, which also includes 4 of a second set of 6 hybrids, are not compatible with tandem repetition models for the chromomere. The sequences in pDm1 are repeated 90 times and are located in 15 different chromomeric regions and within the chromocentric β-heterochromatin. This distribution is of the kind predicted by certain regulatory models, for example, that of Britten and Davidson (1969)."

https://openalex.org/W2068592711,Orientational differences in human visual acuity can be related parametrically to the distribution of optimal orientations for the receptive fields of neurons in the striate cortex of the rhesus monkey. Both behavioral measures of acuity and the distribution of receptive fields exhibit maximums for stimuli horizontal or vertical relative to the retina; the effect diminishes with distance from the fovea. The anisotropy in the neuronal population and in visual acuity appear to be determined by postnatal visual experience.
https://openalex.org/W2004862368,Male rhesus monkeys with orbital prefrontal lesions were imtpaired on behavioral tests at 2(1/2) months of age whereas similar deficits were not detected in females with comparable lesions until 15 to 18 months of age. The results suggest that the maturation of a cortical region in the primate brain proceeds at different tempos in males and females.

https://openalex.org/W1594556785,"Abstract γ-Aminobutyric acid was found in the kidney and in some other tissues in six children. The material obtained was characterized by chromatography on cation exchange columns and on thin layer chromatography, by electrophoresis, and by the synthesis of the trimethylamino derivative, the chromatographic and electrophoretic behavior, melting point, and crystal structure of the AuCl3 salt of which were identical with those of the derivative synthesized from authentic γ-aminobutyric acid. It is concluded that in man, unlike the animals reported, γ-aminobutyric acid is not a unique constituent of the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1589707378,"Abstract Hepatic alkaline phosphatase has been purified 42,000-fold from rats whose bile ducts had been ligated for 24 hours, a procedure which increases hepatic alkaline phosphatase activity 5- to 10-fold. The purified enzyme was obtained in 27% yield and was greater than 98% homogeneous as judged by polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis and meniscus depletion sedimentation equilibrium analysis. The molecular weight of the holoenzyme was 154,000. Rat liver alkaline phosphatase precipitated in 6 m guanidine-HCl but dissociated into two soluble subunits of identical molecular weight (71,200) in 6 m guanidine HCl plus 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate indicated a protein molecular weight of 155,000. The addition of 1% 2-mercaptoethanol caused the dissociation of alkaline phosphatase into two subunits of identical molecular weight, 75,000. The pH optimum for rat liver alkaline phosphatase was 10.2 with p-nitrophenyl-phosphate, 9.0 with phosphorylethanolamine and phosphorylcholine, 8.9 with AMP, ADP, and ATP, and 8.3 with pyrophosphate. Rat liver alkaline phosphatase appears to be a zinc-containing enzyme, loss of which results in irreversible inactivation. Magnesium is required for catalytic activity. Loss of activity after electrodialysis can be rapidly reversed by the addition of magnesium. Purified rat liver alkaline phosphatase has ATPase activity, but the Vmax of ATP is only 12% that of p-nitrophenylphosphate, while its Km is similar, 0.8 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively. The naturally occurring constituents of bile do not stimulate the ATPase activity of pure alkaline phosphatase. Pure rat liver alkaline phosphatase displayed no unusual affinity for phosphorylcholine, a substance suggested as the physiological substrate for this enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1934218715,"Abstract The concentrations of adenosine mono-, di-, and triphosphates, arginine phosphate, and inorganic phosphate in flight muscle of the blowfly, Phormia regina, were measured concurrently after periods of flight ranging from 5 sec to 1 hour. At the onset of contraction, the concentrations of ATP and arginine-P decreased, whereas those of ADP, Pi, and especially AMP, increased. The pattern of changes in these phosphates is in accord with the postulated mechanism of glycolytic regulation at the phosphofructokinase step. Possible oscillatory responses induced by the initiation of active contraction in vivo are suggested."

https://openalex.org/W1985038944,Puromycin reversibly inhibits synthesis of chondroitin sulfate by vertebral chondrocytes from 10-day-old chick embryos. Treatment of these cells with puromycin for 5 hours does not affect viability or capacity to multiply on subsequent release from their matrix. It is suggested that synthesis of this polysaccharide is coupled with that of protein; there may be a feedback control in its synthesis.

https://openalex.org/W1614610635,"Abstract Human tissues and body fluids contain a number of immunologically related R type vitamin B12-binding proteins that can often be distinguished from one another by the use of ion exchange chromatography, electrophoresis, and gel filtration. The single major vitamin B12-binding proteins present in human milk and saliva are included in this group of proteins and have been isolated in homogeneous form with the use of affinity chromatography on vitamin B12-Sepharose. Both proteins bind approximately 20.5 µg of vitamin B12 per mg of protein and are indistinguishable in terms of absorption spectra, immunodiffusion with rabbit antihuman milk and anti-human saliva vitamin B12-binding protein sera, molecular weight (61,000 to 63,000) as determined by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation, total amino acid composition, migration on disc gel electrophoresis, and sequence of the first 13 NH2-terminal amino acids (Glu-Ile-Ser-Glu-Val-Ser-Glu-Glu-Asn-Tyr-Ile-Arg-Leu). Both proteins contain fucose, galactose, mannose, galactosamine, glucosamine, and sialic acid residues, although the saliva vitamin B12-binding protein contains more fucose and galactose and has a higher total carbohydrate content (39.9%) than the milk protein (34.5%). Elevated values for molecular weight were obtained for both proteins with the use of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration, although the respective values obtained for the saliva protein (95,000 and 148,000) were significantly greater than those obtained for the milk protein (90,000 and 136,000). These studies suggest that differences among the various human R type vitamin B12-binding proteins may be due to differences in carbohydrate content rather than to differences in amino acid composition or sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1015077914,"Previous experiments with reconstructed systems of glycolysis (1) were performed with highly purified glycolytic enzymes. All of the enzymes used were derived from rabbit muscle with the exception of hexokinase, which was isolated from yeast. The yeast enzyme was the only soluble and highly purified hexokinase available at the time. In the presence of mitochondria and the reconstituted glycolytic system, competition for common cofactors such as inorganic orthophosphate and adenosine diphosphate was observed. In the presence of limiting concentrations of Pi and ADP, inhibition of lactate production was observed when mitochondria were added in excess, and respiration was inhibited when the glycolytic enzymes predominated. These inhibition phenomena resembled the well known Pasteur and Crabtree effects observed with intact cells. It. was point.ed out, however, at the time (1) that the inhibition of lactate production in the reconstructed system was accompanied by an accumulation of a large amount of fructose-l ,6diphosphate which is not characteristic of the Pasteur effect in intact cells. Although lactate production was inhibited in the reconstructed system, glucose utilization was not, until the entire supply of Pi was converted to fructose-l ) 6-di-P. Then both oxidative phosphorylation and glucose utilization came to a standstill. With the availability of a soluble and purified hexokinase, susceptible to glucose-6-P inhibition (a), and a purified P-fructokinase which is susceptible to ATP inhibition, a reexamination of the problem with the reconst.ructed system seemed appropriate. It is the purpose of this paper to show that t,he utilization of glucose in a reconstructed system with tumor hexokinase is under the sensitive control of the concentration of Pi which exerts a coordinated stimulation of hexokinase and P-fructokinase."

https://openalex.org/W2028276159,"Synaptic activity evoked in cat motoneurons during stretch stimulation of muscle spindles in the homonymous muscle has been studied by intracellular recording. A class of miniature excitatory postsynaptic potentials evoked by such physiologic stimulation results from activity in single group la spindle afferent fibers, and the criterion for identification is a predictable pattern of rhythmic occurrence of the synaptic potentials. Statistical examination of the amplitude distributions of this class of miniature synaptic potentials suggests that some group Ia fibers liberate a relatively large number of quantal excitatory postsynaptic potential units per fiber impulse."

These sugars were also present in hydrolyzates of skeletal keratosulfate. The distribution of the sulfate groups in the various keratosulfates might depend upon their source, and this distribution probably has important biological significance."

https://openalex.org/W1600971583,"Abstract A computer model of the mammalian muscle phosphofructokinase system (with associated chemical reactions) has been constructed in which 22 differential equations represent 22 chemical species involved in 42 chemical reactions. The enzyme is represented in inactive and active forms, interconversion being promoted by activators, such as fructose 1,6-diphosphate, fructose 6-phosphate (2 molecules being required), adenosine monophosphate (both 5' and cyclical, for each of which 3 molecules are required), and inorganic phosphate (5 molecules), and inactivators such as adenosine triphosphate (3 molecules) and citrate (1 molecule). The active form is assumed to have an enzymatic mechanism similar to other kinases, the approximate Km values for ATP and fructose 6-phosphate being about 2 x 10-4 and 4 x 10-5, respectively. The large numbers of activator and inhibitor molecules enable the enzyme activity to be sharply turned on and off; under appropriate circumstances it can generate pulses of product, or act as a flip-flop (two stable states, active and inactive). The physiological significance of these properties is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1566332134,"Abstract The multiplication of Chang human liver cells in tissue culture was inhibited by deoxythymidine in concentrations higher than 0.03 mm, an effect which could be prevented by deoxycytidine as long as the concentration of deoxythymidine was not higher than 0.5 mm. Attempts were made to induce thymidine kinase by growing the liver cells in the presence of exogenous deoxythymidine. Only slight increases in thymidine kinase activity were found in these experiments. A marked increase in specific activity of thymidine kinase was observed when the liver cells were grown in a medium supplemented with amethopterin or 5-fluorodeoxyuridine. The increase in kinase activity caused by amethopterin could be prevented and reversed by adding deoxythymidine to the culture medium. Data are presented indicating that the amethopterin-induced elevation of thymidine kinase activity results from synthesis of new enzyme protein. The results indicate that one, or more, of the phosphorylated derivatives of deoxythymidine controls the synthesis of thymidine kinase of Chang liver cells by repression."
https://openalex.org/W162764231,"Abstract A soluble 1-phosphofructokinase has been extracted from anaerobic bacteria (Bacteroides symbiosus) and sufficiently purified to reveal its mode of action. The enzyme requires a nucleoside 5'-triphosphate (adenosine, inosine, guanosine, or uridine triphosphate) and magnesium or manganous ions. It has been obtained free from hexokinase, d-glyceraldehyde kinase, aldolase, and reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide oxidase. Sorbose-1-P and fructose-6-P are neither substrates nor inhibitors for the enzyme. A spectrophotometric method for the estimation of fructose 1-phosphate is described. It is recommended that hereafter the phosphofructokinases be clearly identified as to their substrate specificities. The previously reported finding of 6-phosphofructokinase in B. symbiosus was not confirmed."

The enzyme has been partially purified and the products of the reaction have been characterized. An inhibitory material associated with the microsomes was largely removed in the preparation of the acetone powder. The nature of the interaction of the enzyme with the naturally occurring inhibitor was found to be very complex, primarily involving changes in Vmax and a shift in pH optimum from pH 8.5 to 8.9 to pH 7.5 to 7.9. The enzyme was also inhibited by detergents and thyroxine."
